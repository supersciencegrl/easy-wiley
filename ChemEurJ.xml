         <title>From Donor&#8208;Acceptor Ligands to Smart Coordination Polymers: Cyanothiazole&#8208;Cu(I) Complexes for Multifunctional Electronic Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyanothiazoles, small and quite overlooked molecules, possess remarkable optical properties that can be fine&#8208;tuned through coordination with transition metals. In this study, we investigate a promising application of cyanothiazoles, where their combination with copper(I) iodide forms a new class of complexes exhibiting outstanding optical properties. X&#8208;ray crystallography of copper(I) iodide complexes with isomeric cyanothiazoles revealed key structural features, such as &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, hydrogen bonding, and rare halogen&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;chalcogen I&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;S interactions, enhancing stability and reactivity. Advanced spectroscopy and computational modeling allowed precise identification of spectral signatures in FTIR, NMR, and UV&#8208;Vis spectra. Fluorescence studies, along with EXAFS and XANES synchrotron analyses, highlighted their unique thermal and electronic properties, providing a solid foundation for further research in the field.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Hybrid Photocatalysts for CO2 Photoreduction by Hybridization of Molecular Catalysts and Photoactive Covalent Organic Frameworks &#8211; A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to obtain storable fuels is an effective way to fix and utilize greenhouse gas CO2, ultimately achieving a carbon free energy cycle. The core of this goal lies the development of efficient, sustainable, and economically practical catalysts and light absorbers. Currently, hybrid photocatalytic systems that immobilize molecular catalysts on covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are of intensified interest, as this strategy enables the simultaneous exploitation of the catalytic properties of high&#8208;performance molecular catalysts, together with the durability of heterogeneous semiconductors, based on the readily available synthetic tunability of both components. This review focuses on the significant progress and challenges that have been overcome for the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction, mediated by COFs hybridized with molecular catalysts, aiming to provide strong guidance for innovative utilization towards sustainable photocatalytic CO2 reduction in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorescent Carbazole&#8208;Derived Aza[5]Helicenes: Synthesis, Functionalization, and Characterization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Variously substituted indolophenanthridines, indolocarbazoles, and cinnolinocarbazoles synthesized by ortho fusion from teraryl precursors show significant Stokes shifts, especially for the protonated states of indolophenanthridines and cinnolinocarbazole. These compounds combine helical and axial chirality and show prominent aggregation&#8208;induced emission, which is considerably enhanced in conjugates with tetraphenylethylene.

Abstract
5,8&#8208;Dihydroindolo[2,3&#8208;c]carbazole (ICz), 9H&#8208;cinnolino[3,4&#8208;c]carbazole (CnCz), and variously alkyl&#8208;, alkenyl&#8208;, and aryl&#8208;substituted indolo[2,3&#8208;k]&#8208; and &#8208;[3,2&#8208;a]phenanthridines (IPs) were synthesized using an ortho fusion strategy with Suzuki cross couplings, intramolecular nitrene insertions, diazo couplings, and Morgan&#8211;Walls cyclizations as key reactions. The IPs were additionally transformed into organoboranes and helicene conjugates with tetraphenylethylene derivatives. The compounds fluoresce with large Stokes shifts, exhibit strong acidochromism, and show a good to excellent aggregation&#8208;induced emission. Their helical structure was elucidated by x&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and by quantum chemical calculations. HOMO&#8211;LUMO gaps of 3.96&#8722;4.06&#160;eV and S1&#8208;T1 gaps were calculated, with CnCz showing a small singlet&#8208;triplet inversion. Relative pKa values of 6.65&#8722;9.55 were estimated for the different types of azahelicenes.

         <title>Polyacrylamide&#8208;Grafted MXenes Prepared via on&#8208;Surface Polymerization Demonstrated Enhanced Aqueous Dispersion and Colloidal Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;soluble initiator was introduced onto the surface of the Ti3C2 MXenes via diazonium chemistry and used to initiate atom transfer radical polymerization to graft a bunch of hydrophilic polymers. The introduction of polymer bunch endowed the MXenes with sufficient stability and dispersity in biological media without attenuating their photothermal conversion capacities which made them hold great application potentials for biomedical sciences.








Abstract
As a novel type of two&#8208;dimensional materials, MXenes demonstrated great potential for biomedical applications due to their excellent photothermal and photodynamic properties. However, their exposed unmodified surface cannot ensure sufficient stability for MXene in a biological environment. Here, we developed an efficient method to modify the surface of MXenes in aqueous medium. A water&#8208;soluble initiator was designed and covalently anchored onto MXene surfaces, which was used to initiate copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed atom transfer radical polymerization to introduce a layer of water&#8208;soluble polyacrylamide on MXene surfaces (PAM&#8208;MXenes). Impressively, it was found that the grafting of the polymer layer on MXene surfaces greatly enhanced the colloidal stability of modified MXenes which remained well dispersed in cell culture medium for over 7 days and for over one month in water without aggregation or sedimentation. Furthermore, their photothermal properties were not influenced as the PAM&#8208;MXenes demonstrated uncompromised heat&#8208;generating capacities upon irradiation at 808&#160;nm nor did they cause marked toxicity to cells. Thus, our work provided an effective approach to ameliorate the surface properties of MXene materials.

         <title>DOS&#8208;like strategy for the spirocyclic MedChem relevant building blocks via Petasis / Grubbs reactions sequence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Through this model study, we showed broad perspectives on utilizing the DOS&#8208;like approach on the building block level in combination with well&#8208;developed methodologies for parallel synthesis for decoration and extension of ultra&#8208;large tangible chemical space to increase the speed and quality of drug discovery screening campaigns. This strategy led us to 16 novel Bemis&#8208;Murco scaffolds based on spirocyclic functionalized piperidines. The efficient, preparative, and scalable DOS&#8208;like approach to the above&#8208;mentioned motif was achieved by Petasis/Grubbs reactions sequence in a multigram scale. The chemoinformatically generated amide&#8208;based compound libraries demonstrated significant expansion of the chemical space of tangible compounds (on the example of Enamine&#8217;s REAL database).</dc:description>

High regioselection in the synthesis of brominated and amino&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8208;diazaazulenes enables regiocontrolled access to a series of differently substituted 4&#8208;, 6&#8208;, and 8&#8208;amino&#8208;1,3&#8208;diazaazulenes with soft&#8208;tunable optical properties. The tetra&#8208;aminosubstituted diazaazulenes are not entirely planar, as observed by crystallographic and computational studies for a series of derivatives. The structural distortion is also connected to the unusual hydrolytic reactivity of the amine substituents in acidic media.








Abstract
We report a facile method for the functionalization of the 1,3&#8208;diazaazulene core at the C4, C6, and C8 positions via regioselective bromination and subsequent substitution with amine nucleophiles. Both steps can be controlled to enable selective mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, or trisubstitution at C4, C6, or C8. Crystallographic studies revealed significant distortion from planarity in the aromatic core of the highly substituted 2,4,6,8&#8208;tetra&#8208;amino&#8208;1,3&#8208;diazaazulenes, further confirmed by density functional theory (DFT). The tetra&#8208;aminosubstituted diazaazulenes displayed unusual hydrolytic reactivity in acidic media, a reaction that is rare with aminobenzenes and appears to be promoted in this case by structural distortion. The combinatorial functionalization of 1,3&#8208;diazaazulene resulted in soft&#8208;tunable optical properties observed in both solution and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) films. Strong low&#8208;energy absorptions (&#949; = 11,800&#8211;38,500 M&#8722;1&#183;cm&#8722;1), arise from &#960;&#8211;&#960;* transitions, as supported by our 2nd order approximate coupled&#8208;cluster (CC2) calculations. Consequently, the fluorescence relaxation mechanism involves a &#960;*&#8211;&#960; transition mixed with charge transfer, producing emission spanning from deep blue to yellow (&#955;em_max = 428&#8211;535). We anticipate that the modular synthesis, tunable substitution patterns, and consequent modulation of both reactivity and photophysical properties renders the 1,3&#8208;diazaazulene core an intriguing molecular platform for a variety of applications.

         <title>Designed Metal&#8208;Free Quasi&#8208;1D Crystals with Giant Birefringence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four metal&#8208;free quasi&#8208;chain crystals&#8212;(C5H6NO)+(NO3)&#8208; (4HPN), (C5H6NO)+(HC2O4)&#8208; (4HPO), (C4N3H6)+(NO3)&#8208; (2APMN), and (C4N3H6)+(HC2O4)&#8208;&#183;H2O (2APMO)&#8212;exhibit both giant birefringence and wide bandgaps and were readily grown as centimeter&#8208;scale crystals via a mild aqueous solution approach.








Abstract
Birefringence, a vital property of anisotropic crystals, is indispensable for advanced optical technologies. Quasi&#8208;1D structures, with their inherent structural anisotropy, offer fertile ground for discovering materials with exceptional optical anisotropy. In this work, we report four metal&#8208;free quasi&#8208;1D crystals&#8212;(C5H6NO)+(NO3)&#8208;(4HPN), (C5H6NO)+(HC2O4)&#8208;(4HPO), (C4N3H6)+(NO3)&#8208;(2APMN), and (C4N3H6)+(HC2O4)&#8208;&#183;H2O (2APMO)&#8212;designed to feature pseudo&#8208;chain structures and grown as centimeter&#8208;scale crystals via a facile aqueous&#8208;solution method. These crystals display wide bandgaps (3.40&#8211;4.48&#160;eV) and exceptional birefringence, with calculated values up to 0.555@546&#160;nm and an experimental maximum of 0.597@546&#160;nm for 4HPN. The giant birefringence stems from their quasi&#8208;1D architectures, high&#8208;spatial density, and optimal arrangement of the birefringence&#8208;active groups (BAGs). This study highlights the promise of metal&#8208;free quasi&#8208;1D materials for next&#8208;generation miniaturized polarization optics and laser&#8208;driven applications.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Assisted &#945;&#8208;Activation of Ketones, Their Arylation and Keto&#8208;Enol Equilibrium Confined into a Macrocycle</title>

A series of ketones undergoes Co&#8208;assisted &#945;&#8208;arylation under confinement within a carbaporphyrin environment, altering macrocycles&#8217; chemistry and forming unique structural motifs.








Abstract
In this study, we explore the cobalt&#8208;mediated &#945;&#8208;activation of ketones within modified porphyrin macrocycles, focusing on the arylation processes and the influence of macrocyclic confinement on keto&#8208;enol tautomerism. The activation of ketones such as acetone, butanone, 3&#8208;pentanone, and acetophenone and their possible transfer from a cobalt center on the carbaporphyrin fragment results in the formation of new C(sp2)&#9472;C(sp3) bonds in confined macrocyclic environments of N&#8208;confused porphyrin and azuliporphyrin. Such modified ligands allow for following altered keto&#8208;enol equilibrium. They reversibly form unique structural motifs, azuleno[1,2&#8208;c]pyran and 2,4&#8208;dihydropyrano[3,4&#8208;c]pyrrole modulated by acid&#8208;base conditions and macrocyclic aromaticity. The coordination of a modified macrocycle to a rhodium(I) center leads to a series of complexes with a final form with rhodium(III) in the cavity. The rhodium(III) center cleaved the C(21)&#9472;C bond and transferred the acetone fragment back to the metal ion from the azulene fragment.

         <title>FeOHSO4@C Cathode with Low Strain and High Pseudocapacitance for Advanced Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The open crystal structure of FeOHSO4@C is demonstrated to provide sufficient space, facilitating K+ ionic diffusion and it exhibits outstanding potassium storage capacity attributed to a low&#8208;strain mechanism for K+ uptake/removal, high pseudocapacitance, as well as 3D electronic conductive framework.








Abstract
Iron&#8208;based polyanionic cathode materials in potassium&#8208;ion batteries (KIBs) have appealed to an increasing number of interest due to these advantages of low cost, environmental friendliness and excellent structural stability. However, these inherent drawbacks of inferior electronic conductivity and terrible nanostructural stability hinder its practical application. Here, we report a novel low&#8208;strain iron&#8208;based polyanion&#8208;type cathode material FeOHSO4@C for KIBs. In this work, the surface of FeOHSO4 nanoparticles is well carbon encapsulated, carbon coating layer with large surface area and excellent electrical conductivity is &#8776;2.5&#160;nm in thick, which can not only inhibit the aggregation and growth between FeOHSO4@C nanoparticles during charging and discharging, but also provide a 3D electronic conductive framework that activates electrochemical reactivity. As a result, the FeOHSO4@C cathode exhibits outstanding potassium storage capacity (capacity retention of 80.95% over 200 cycles at 20&#160;mA g&#8722;1) attributed to a low&#8208;strain mechanism for K+ uptake/removal, high pseudocapacitance, as well as 3D electronic conductive framework. Operando XRD and ex situ XPS analyses revealed a single&#8208;phase reaction route of orthorhombic FeOHSO4@C during cycling.

         <title>Dynamic Copper(I) and Silver(I) Complexes of Tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;cyclotriphosphane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of cyclo&#8208;(P3tBu3) with CuI and AgI salts led to the di&#8208; and tetranuclear complexes [Cun(&#956;&#8208;Br)n{&#956;&#8208;cyclo&#8208;(P3tBu3)&#8208;&#954;P1,&#954;P2}2] and [Agn(OTf)n(CH3CN)2n&#8722;2{&#956;&#8208;cyclo&#8208;(P3tBu3)&#8208;&#954;P1,&#954;P2}2] (n&#160;=&#160;2, 4). In solution, these complexes exhibit a dynamic equilibrium involving continuous dissociation and reforming of phosphorus&#8208;metal bonds. This behavior was demonstrated by low&#8208;temperature 31P{1H} NMR spectroscopy and corroborated by DFT calculations.

Complexes 1, 2, 4 and 5 were isolated as crystalline powders or single crystals and characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction. In solution, these complexes exhibit a dynamic equilibrium which involves continuous dissociation and reforming of phosphorus&#8722;metal bonds leading to isomeric intermediates. This behavior was demonstrated by low&#8208;temperature 31P{1H} NMR spectroscopy and the conclusions were corroborated by DFT calculations.

         <title>CuOx&#8208;ZrO2&#8208;TiOx Composite Interfaces with Strong Lewis Acid Activity for Electrooxidation of Methane to Acetic Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical conversion of methane (CH4) to valuable oxygenates is an attractive approach to utilize abundant natural gas, however, the chemical inertness of CH4 and low solubility in electrolytes impede effective electrooxidation. Enhancing the adsorption and activation of CH4 on catalysts is crucial for electrocatalytic methane oxidation reaction (eMOR). In this study, we develop the CuOx&#8208;ZrO2&#8208;TiOx composite catalyst for the selective electrooxidation of CH4 to CH3COOH. The ZrO2&#8208;TiOx was in situ synthesized on Ti substrates via the hydrothermal reaction of TiO2 nanowires with H2C2O4 and Zr(NO3)4. Subsequently, CuOx was uniformly disposed on ZrO2&#8208;TiOx with the assistance of polyvinylpyrrolidone and citric acid. The prepared electrode achieves the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 60.1% for CH3COOH at the current density of 10.8 mA cm&#8208;2, corresponding to the generation rate of 3312.5 &#956;mol gcat&#8208;1 h&#8208;1. Mechanism studies confirm that the synergistic effect of CuOx and ZrO2&#8208;TiOx interfaces enhances the efficiency of eMOR. CuOx oxidizes H2O to produce hydroxyl radicals (*OH) and ZrO2&#8208;TiOx interfaces with strong Lewis acid activity adsorb and activate CH4. The CuOx and ZrO2&#8208;TiOx interfaces synergistically oxidize CH4 to generate a series of intermediates (*CH3, *CH3O, *CH2O, *COOH), promoting C&#8208;C coupling to produce CH3COOH.</dc:description>

         <title>A Robust Strategy for Introducing Amino&#8208;Modifiers in Nucleic Acids: Enabling Novel Amino Tandem Oligonucleotide Synthesis in DNA and RNA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a simple, efficient, and cost&#8208;effective methodology for introducing amino&#8208;modifiers into DNA and RNA using a commercially available solid support. By incorporating a base&#8208;labile sulfonyl linker within the strand, we developed an amino&#8208;containing tandem oligonucleotide synthesis (aTOS) methodology, which enables the introduction of multiple terminal amino (or monophosphate) groups across two oligonucleotide strands. Our approach provides a straightforward and robust strategy for incorporating amino modifiers in oligonucleotides.








Abstract
Amino&#8208;modifiers are pivotal chemical modifications in nucleic acid scaffolds, serving applications ranging from (bio)conjugation to probing the origins of life. We report a simple, efficient, and cost&#8208;effective methodology for the introduction of amino&#8208;modifiers into DNA and RNA. This approach leverages a commercially available sulfonyl&#8208;containing solid support, which is first converted into a mixed N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide carbonate, enabling robust conjugation with primary and secondary amines whether nucleosidic or non&#8208;nucleosidic. Oligonucleotides are synthesized via solid&#8208;phase synthesis and purified using standard methods, with little to no modification. Building on this framework, we introduce a novel amino&#8208;containing tandem oligonucleotide synthesis (aTOS) methodology, which facilitates the introduction of multiple terminal amino (or monophosphate) groups across two oligonucleotide strands. This innovative method broadens the toolkit for the introduction of amino modifications in nucleic acids, for applications in nucleic acid (bio)chemistry and biotechnology.

         <title>Coexistence of the Perfluorinated Cp* Anion With Oxidizing and Electrophilic Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The perfluorinated Cp* [C5(CF3)5]&#8722; is known for its unique ligand/counteranion switchability and is now introduced as a weakly coordinating anion (WCA). Its extraordinarily low nucleophilicity, combined with its pronounced oxidative stability, allows for the coexistence with reactive cations and the formation of unprecedented salts.








Abstract
The air&#8208; and water&#8208;stable perfluorinated Cp* [C5(CF3)5]&#8722; is presented as a candidate for the vastly underexplored group of weakly coordinating carbanions (WCCAs). Its extreme electron deficiency, combined with the stabilization of the negative charge within an aromatic system, results in a low basicity, yielding a very weak coordination ability. As Cp anions usually possess a strongly pronounced carbanionic character, the perfluorinated Cp* resembles an extraordinary exception for both the WCA and Cp chemistry. However, the coordination ability remains ambivalent due to the substitution lability of many of its complexes, allowing for the formation of unique ligand&#8208;WCA switches. Due to the low reactivity, there is a need for new transfer reagents containing the perfluorinated Cp* in combination with reactive cations. Thus, we report the synthesis and complete characterization of [C5(CF3)5]&#8722; salts with hydride&#8208;accepting [(C6H5)3C]+, valuable Ag(I) reagents, oxidizing [Fe(C5H5)2]+ or [N(p&#8208;C6H4Br)3]+ and Br&#248;nsted acidic [H(m,m&#8208;NC5H3F2)2]+. Notably, these unprecedented ion pairs are exclusively accessible and stabilized by the low coordination affinity and pronounced oxidative resistance of the perfluorinated Cp*.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Nitrides as Superior Electrocatalysts: Unveiling the Role of Entropy in Enhanced Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy nitrides catalyst (CoNiCuVW)N with the different elements distributionwas synthesized using a new facile and in&#8208;situ method, showing excellent ORR and Zn&#8208;air catalytic performance. The entropy effect significantly reduces the binding energy of strongly adsorbed *OH intermediates, enhancing electrochemical activity.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy nitrides (HENs) are emerging as promising electrocatalysts due to their diverse elemental composition, tunable electrochemical properties, and a wide range of active sites that enhance adsorption and oxidation reactions. However, the unclear role of entropy has limited their full potential in electrocatalysis. In this study, we introduce a novel and straightforward method for synthesizing (CoNiCuVW)N with variable entropy levels using halite as a molten salt. By exploiting the synergistic effects of multiple metal components, we achieve robust bonding between the N&#8208;doped carbon substrate and HEN nanoparticles, resulting in a homogeneous element distribution. This uniformity leads to exceptional catalytic performance for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline electrolytes, with an onset potential of 0.96&#160;V and a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.91&#160;V. Additionally, HEN&#8208;based zinc&#8208;air batteries exhibit impressive performance, achieving 1.55&#160;V and maintaining 60% roundtrip efficiency over approximately 400 cycles. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the high&#8208;entropy, homogeneous distribution of elements enhances active site availability, modulates electronic structure, and optimizes kinetics, thereby lowering reaction barriers during the ORR. This work not only facilitates the development of structurally ordered HEN nanoparticles but also lays the foundation for further exploration in electrochemical applications.

         <title>Photochemical Homologated Aminophosphorylation of Carbon&#8208;Carbon &#960;&#8208;, and &#963;&#8208;Bonds Through Radical Translocation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving homologous 1,n&#8208;functionalizations requires breaking the monopoly posed by the vicinal difunctionalizations. Radical translocation thereby becomes the weapon of choice, allowing access to traditionally difficult transformations. Herein, aminophosphorylation of alkenes, from 1,3&#8208; and all the way to 1,6&#8208;, is achieved. Additionally, strained &#963;&#8208;bonds are harnessed as well, leading to unique cyclobutylated aminophosphonates.








Abstract
Difunctionalization of olefins serves as the workhorse for rapid creation of molecular complexity from simple feedstocks. However, these reactions are mostly restricted to the 1,2&#8208;variant, with higher homologations being attempted to a much lesser extent. Radical translocation strategies serve as an escape from the traditional 1,2&#8208;strategies, providing a means for achieving distant functionalizations that are otherwise difficult to access. Herein, we disclose visible light&#8208;mediated strategies for the accessing of 1,3&#8208;, 1,4&#8208;, 1,5&#8208;, and 1,6&#8208;aminophosphonates via combination of various radical shifting methods. In addition, the aminophosphorylation of &#963;&#8208;bonds was also achieved, leading to 1,3&#8208;aminophosphorylated cyclobutanes.

         <title>Self&#8208;Sensitized Fulgimides with Selective Multiplicity&#8208;Based Three&#8208;State Photoswitching</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling photoinduced reactions by the excited&#8208;state multiplicity remains a significant challenge. We present a systematic approach to unimolecular three&#8208;state photoswitching of fulgimides, utilizing the multimodal role of excited&#8208;state multiplicity. By combining direct excitation with the rationally designed triplet&#8208;exclusive sensitizer, we differentiate the reactivity of singlet and triplet excited states within the hexatriene core of fulgimides, enabling precise control of their photoisomerization.








Abstract
Precise control over excited&#8208;state multiplicity is a powerful strategy for controlling photochemical reactivity, particularly in multimodal systems where different multiplicities lead to distinct reaction products. Here, we present a multiplicity&#8208;sensitive, multimodal, fulgimide&#8208;based system capable of three&#8208;state photoswitching both in solution and in the solid state. With the aim of suppressing singlet&#8208;state sensitization, we rationally designed an intramolecularly sensitized system that enables triplet&#8208;exclusive energy transfer&#8212;a crucial feature for selective multiplicity&#8208;dependent reactivity. Our findings provide insights into the underlying principles of intramolecular triplet&#8208;exclusive sensitization and its application in controlling three&#8208;state photoswitching in unimolecular systems.

         <title>The Careful Combination of Bismuth Compounds and CAAC: Formal Halonium and Nitrenium Transfer via Radical Pathways</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fundamental bismuth compounds such as BiCl3 and BiBr(NMe2)2 form simple, colorful adducts with cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes. They undergo facile and selective formal X+ and (NMe2)+ transfer from bismuth to the carbene via peerless radical pathways.








Abstract
Cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes (CAACs) are key compounds en route to a plethora of unprecedented low&#8208;valent and radical complexes of transition metals and main group elements. For p&#8208;block elements of the sixth period, however, low&#8208;valent and radical complexes of CAACs are extremely rare, and even simple adducts with CAACs are difficult to access. Here we report the full characterization of the first adduct between a CAAC and a bismuth trihalide, [BiCl3(Me2CAAC)] (1), which has previously only been spectroscopically characterized. 1 and its in situ generated bromido analog form intensely colored solutions in solvent molecule (THF) and undergo formal halonium ion (i.e., X+) transfer from the Bi atom to the carbene carbon atom to give the complex cations [CAAC&#9472;X]+ (X = Cl, Br). Starting from bismuth amide complexes, formal nitrenium ion (i.e., [NR2]+) transfer reactions are observed to give [CAAC&#9472;NR2]+. EPR spectroscopic reaction monitoring indicates the viability of radical processes and suggests the involvement of unprecedented &#945;&#8208;aminyl radicals and mononuclear Bi0 species. Our investigations reveal easily accessible radical pathways via peerless molecular complexes, which proceed in the absence of external reducing agents, as a key factor on the way to exploit the full potential of carbene ligands in the chemistry of sixth row p&#8208;block elements.

         <title>High Drug Loading Pillar[5]Arene&#8208;Based Nanodrug Delivery System Enhances Anticancer Efficacy and Reduces Toxicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thioether pillar[5]arene and 6&#8208;hexylpyridinium self&#8208;assemble into a supramolecular nanocarrier system with ultra&#8208;high drug loading efficiency 97% for doxorubicin (DOX), reducing toxicity to normal cells and enhancing anti&#8208;tumor activity. In H2O2, thioether pillar[5]arene transforms into a more water&#8208;soluble derivative, minimizing excipient accumulation and offering new insights for designing safer drug delivery systems.








Abstract
Nanodrug delivery is a critical approach in cancer therapy; however, the deposition of excipients often exacerbates the toxic burden of drugs. Herein, a pillar[5]arene&#8208;based supramolecular nanodrug delivery system (WP5&#8835;C6Py@DOX) has been developed to enhance cancer therapy efficacy while minimizing side effects. This system, constructed through host&#8211;guest interactions between a thioether&#8208;modified pillar[5]arene derivative (WP5) and a pyridinium salt derivative (C6Py), exhibited a remarkable 97% drug loading capacity for doxorubicin (DOX). It showed remarkable stability in both aqueous solutions and bovine serum, effectively minimizing premature drug leakage and reducing associated toxicity. The thioether modification of WP5 reacted with H2O2 to generate derivatives with improved water solubility, significantly enhancing biocompatibility while minimizing excipient deposition within endosomes. Cellular experiments revealed that the system not only reduced the toxicity of DOX to normal cells (BEAS&#8208;2B) but also significantly enhanced its antitumor activity against cancer cells (HepG2), with an IC50 of 1.2 &#181;m, markedly outperforming free DOX (IC50: 6.3 &#181;m). Furthermore, laser confocal imaging confirmed that the supramolecular drug delivery system effectively enters and accumulates in cancer cells, demonstrating promising therapeutic potential.

It showed remarkable stability in both aqueous solutions and bovine serum, effectively minimizing premature drug leakage and reducing associated toxicity. The thioether modification of WP5 reacted with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to generate derivatives with improved water solubility, significantly enhancing biocompatibility while minimizing excipient deposition within endosomes. Cellular experiments revealed that the system not only reduced the toxicity of DOX to normal cells (BEAS-2B) but also significantly enhanced its antitumor activity against cancer cells (HepG2), with an IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of 1.2 &#181;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;, markedly outperforming free DOX (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;: 6.3 &#181;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;). Furthermore, laser confocal imaging confirmed that the supramolecular drug delivery system effectively enters and accumulates in cancer cells, demonstrating promising therapeutic potential.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chlorosulfenic Acid: An Important Linker in the Coupled Sulfur and Chlorine Chemistry in the Venusian Atmosphere</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The elusive chlorosulfenic acid (HOSCl) has been synthesized in the gas phase and spectroscopically characterized. The photochemistry of HOSCl reveals that it is very likely involved in the Venus&#8217; atmosphere, where its photofragments hydrogen chloride (HCl) and sulfur monoxide (SO) are known as abundant reactive chlorine and sulfur gases, respectively.








Abstract
The coupled sulfur and chlorine chemistry plays an important role in the chemical cycle of the Venusian atmosphere. However, the reactivity of sulfur monoxide (SO) toward hydrochloric acid (HCl), two abundant reactive gases in the Venusian atmosphere remains hitherto unknown. In this work, we report the generation, spectroscopic characterization, and photochemistry of chlorosulfenic acid (HOSCl), a simple molecule that acts not only as a potential candidate for the near&#8208;UV absorber but also as an important linker in the coupled sulfur and chlorine chemistry in the Venusian atmosphere. This molecule has bright absorption from 330 to 440&#160;nm. The photochemistry of HOSCl at 365&#160;nm yields SO and HCl as a novel hydrogen&#8208;bonded molecular complex in a cryogenic Ar&#8208;matrix at 10 K, and the subsequent irradiation at 193&#160;nm leads to recombination of the two fragments by reformation of HOSCl. The photochemistry of HOSCl underscores its importance in the photochemical models of the sulfur and chlorine species in Venusian atmosphere.

         <title>Halogen Bond&#8208;Driven Ligand Displacement: Co&#8208;Crystal Lattice Versus Coordination Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong halogen bond donor (1,4&#8208;diiodotetrafluorobenzene) can induce the amine ligand displacement in Jahn&#8211;Teller affected Cu(acac)2(amine) and in trans influenced VO(acac)2(amine) complexes, resulting the formation of respective co&#8208;crystals: M(acac)2&#183;1,4&#8208;DITFB and (amine)&#183;1,4&#8208;DITFB. The driving force behind this unprecedented cleavage of the metal&#8208;nitrogen coordination bond is the halogen bond stabilized co&#8208;crystal lattice






.

Abstract
Coordination bonds are generally stronger than halogen bonds; however, the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect in d&#8313; Cu(II) and the trans influence of the oxo&#8208;ligand in vanadyl (V&#9552;O) acetylacetonates can weaken N&#8594;Cu/V bonds, bringing them closer to the upper range of halogen bond strength. The study investigates the interactions between transition metal acetylacetonate complexes, M(acac)2(L) (M&#9472;Cu(II), V(IV) = O; L&#160;=&#160;amine ligands), and halogen bond (XB)&#8208;donor co&#8208;formers, particularly 1,4&#8208;diiodotetrafluorobenzene (1,4&#8208;DITFB). The co&#8208;crystallization experiments reveal an unusual ligand displacement phenomenon wherein the expected M(acac)2(L)&#183;1,4&#8208;DITFB complexes fail to form, instead yielding separate M(acac)2&#183;1,4&#8208;DITFB and L&#183;1,4&#8208;DITFB co&#8208;crystals. Computational studies reveal that while XB interactions alone may be insufficient to disrupt the M&#9472;N coordination bond, they can induce ligand displacement when amplified by the lattice stabilization of the resulting halogen&#8208;bonded co&#8208;crystals, particularly in Jahn&#8211;Teller distorted d&#8313; Cu(II) and trans&#8208;influenced V(IV) = O complexes interacting with halogen bond donors.

         <title>Liquid PEG and PEGDA as Protective Matrices for TTA&#8208;UC Functioning in Air and Their Application in Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two photochemically deoxygenating compounds, PEG&#8208;200 and PEGDA&#8208;575, have been used as solvents for triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion in air, with both serving as sensitized singlet oxygen scavengers. A high&#8208;level information encryption platform has been developed using Pt(OEP)/DPA/PEGDA&#8208;575 or Pt(OEP)/DPA/PEGDA&#8208;575/PEG&#8208;200 ink that enables data to be read under specific light or at a certain time and erased by light exposure.








Abstract
Photochemical deoxygenation offers a promising solution to the oxygen sensitivity issue in Triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC). This study utilized polyethylene glycol (PEG)&#8208;200 and polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA)&#8208;575 as solvents and singlet oxygen scavengers for TTA&#8208;UC conducted in air. The upconversion efficiency of Pt(OEP)/DPA in aerated PEG&#8208;200 is similar to that in nitrogen&#8208;saturated PEG&#8208;200. Prolonged 532&#160;nm light irradiation causes a PEGDA&#8208;575 solution of Pt(OEP)/DPA to undergo photoinitiated polymerization via homomolecular TTA, leading to a reduction in DPA's upconversion emission and an increase in Pt(OEP)&#8217;s phosphorescence. These results enabled the development of a high&#8208;level information encryption platform using the direct&#8208;writing method with Pt(OEP)/DPA/PEGDA&#8208;575 or Pt(OEP)/DPA/PEGDA&#8208;575/PEG&#8208;200 ink. The information is only readable under certain lighting conditions or at specific times and can be erased by exposure to light.

A copper hydride (CuH)&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and enantioselective hydroallylation of 1&#8208;trifluoromethylthioalkenes has been developed. The appropriate choice of chiral ligands successfully promotes the enantioselective C(sp3)&#9472;C(sp3) bond formation at the &#945;&#8208;position of trifluoromethylthio (SCF3) group. Detailed experimental and computational mechanistic studies reveal that leaving groups of allylic electrophiles significantly influence enantioselectivity as well as chemoselectivity.

A copper&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and enantioselective hydroallylation of 1&#8208;trifluoromethylthioalkenes with hydrosilanes and allylic electrophiles has been developed. The judicious choice of chiral ligands successfully promotes the enantioselective C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp3) bond formation at the &#945;&#8208;position of trifluoromethylthio (SCF3) group, which is otherwise difficult to perform by other means.

The judicious choice of chiral ligands successfully promotes the enantioselective C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8211;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) bond formation at the &#945;-position of trifluoromethylthio (SCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) group, which is otherwise difficult to perform by other means. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies reveal that leaving groups of allylic electrophiles significantly influence the enantioselectivity as well as chemoselectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Kinetically arrested SERS&#8208;Active aggregates for biosensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is a demand for biosensors capable of long&#8208;term, non&#8208;invasive monitoring of low analyte concentrations in various biofluids for diagnostics, personalized healthcare, and disease monitoring. Biofluids present challenges to biosensor sensing and stability on account of their complex composition and dynamic nature. Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) offers ultra&#8208;high sensitivity, non&#8208;destructive, real&#8208;time monitoring and non&#8208;invasive detection, ideal for sensing in complex media. Plasmonic gold nanoparticle (AuNP) SERS&#8208;active assemblies have been widely explored owning to their biocompatibility and tuneable sensitivity based on AuNP morphology. Controlled aggregation of AuNPs has been achieved by incorporating a &#8216;molecular&#8208;glue&#8217;, cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]), to produce AuNP:CB[7] aggregates containing robust nanogaps (ca. 1 nm) and displaying strong, reproducible SERS signals at low concentrations, but eventually leads to irreversible precipitation. Here we employ thiolated poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG&#8208;SH) to produce kinetically trapped metastable AuNP:CB[7]:PEG aggregates. The aggregates maintain SERS&#8208;activity, are highly tuneable through facile modification of the PEG chain length and grafting density, and possess improved stability. Moreover, the AuNP:CB[7]:PEG aggregates demonstrate low concentration detection of a common Raman reporter alongside a bioanalyte in a range of biofluids highlighting the potential application of these aggregates for non&#8208;invasive in vivo long&#8208;term monitoring alongside future customized SERS biosensing applications.</dc:description>

         <title>The Effect of Aldehyde and Carboxylic Acid Substitution on the Isomerization of Hemithioindigo Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hemithioindigo (HTI) photoswitches exhibit robust photoisomerization under visible light and relatively high thermal bistability. In this work, we report various modifications of the HTI core, namely the introduction of aldehydes and carboxylic acids at the para position of the stilbene fragment with different oxidation states of the sulfur center, and the incorporation of a Schiff base moiety. These modifications allowed tuning of the absorption properties, quantum yields of isomerization, and thermal stability of the metastable E&#8208;isomers. Notably, the formyl&#8208; and carboxyl&#8208;substituted HTI switches achieved high yields of isomerization under visible light in various solvents, while sulfur oxidation enhanced quantum yields but reduced photochromism. Schiff base formation led to red&#8208;shifted absorption and increased thermal stability. Finally, by leveraging the carboxyl substituents, we incorporated an HTI chromophore into the NU&#8208;1000 metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), and demonstrated solid&#8208;state photoisomerization. These findings highlight key structural modifications that expand the applicability of HTI photoswitches for molecular switching in solution and solid&#8208;state environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8208;H Oxidation of Alkanes and Post&#8208;Functionalization of Polyolefin Elastomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study focuses on the post&#8208;functionalization of polyolefin elastomers (POE) through direct C&#8208;H activation using a novel cobalt&#8208;based catalytic system. The investigation, initiated with the oxidation of cyclohexane, identified the cumene hydroperoxide (CumHPO) as the optimal oxidant and ligands L3, L4, and L7 as effective in chlorinated benzene solvents. Cobalt catalyst (Cat. 1) demonstrated superior activity in the oxidation of octadecane, achieving a 42% yield with a minimal catalyst amounts. The catalytic system was successfully extended to the C&#8208;H oxidation of POE, introducing functional groups in solvents like 1,2&#8208;Cl2C6H4 and 1,2,4&#8208;Cl3C6H3. Our findings propose a simple and green approach for the post&#8208;functionalization of POE, offering versatility and potential for broader applications in the field of polymeric compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective meta C&#8211;H Bond Olefination of Anilides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a Cu&#8208;catalyzed meta&#8208;olefination of anilides using alkenyl iodonium salts. The olefination of a panel of pivanilides was achieved using an additive&#8208;free copper&#8208;based catalytic system under mild reaction conditions (25 examples, up to 60% yield). By favoring a Heck&#8208;like four&#8208;membered transition state, the approach demonstrated an excellent regioselectivity for the meta C&#8722;H functionalization with &#946;&#8208;styrenyl and &#946;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;alkenyl groups using a weakly coordinated directing group. Post&#8208;functionalization reactions were conducted, highlighting both the synthetic interest of the products and the potential atom&#8208;efficiency of the process.</dc:description>

         <title>A Copper(I) Catenane Decorated Metal&#8208;Organic Layer as a Heterogenous Catalyst for Dehydrogenative Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While Earth&#8208;abundant metals are green and sustainable alternatives to precious metals for catalytic chemical conversions, the fast ligand exchange involving most of the base metals renders their development into robust, reusable catalysts very challenging. Described in this work is a new type of heterogeneous catalyst derived from a 2D metal&#8208;organic layer (MOL) grafted with catenane&#8208;coordinated Cu(I) complexes. In addition to the good substrate accessibility, easy functionalization and other favorable features due to the MOL support, the mechanical bond in the anchored catenane ligands also represents a new mechanism to dynamically confine the coordination environment and kinetically stabilize the coordinated Cu(I) to give a well&#8208;defined, active yet stable heterogeneous catalyst. Pilot catalytic studies using a model dehydrogenative C&#8211;O cross coupling reaction showed that the Cu(I) catenane&#8208;grafted MOL led to exclusive formation of the C&#8211;O coupled product, whereas control catalysis using a similar Cu(I) catalyst supported by non&#8208;interlocked macrocyclic ligands was found to also give a C&#8211;C coupled by&#8208;product, whose formation was found to be mediated by the uncontrolled presence of Cu(II), highlighting the distinctive roles and untapped potential of the catenane coordination in developing base metal&#8208;derived catalysts for challenging catalytic conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Higher BODIPY Homologues &#8211; Synthesis, Reactivity and Photoluminescence Investigations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of MesDPM group 13 (B&#8211;In, MesDPM = 1,5,9&#8208;trimesityldipyrromethene) compounds with halide substituents (Cl&#8211;I) is described. All compounds were fully characterized including NMR and IR spectroscopy as well as mass spectrometry. In addition, the solid state molecular structures have been determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. As higher representatives of BODIPY (= boron difluoride dipyrromethene) dyes, some of these MesDPM triel dihalides also exhibit an intense green fluorescence when exposed to sunlight. In this regard, the optical properties were investigated by UV/Vis and photoluminescence spectroscopy giving absorption maxima around 520 nm and fluorescence emission in the range between and 550 and 660 nm. Fluorescence quantum efficiencies up to 42% could be obtained from measurements in toluene solution. Further, reactivity studies were carried out which opened&#8208;up access to mixed substituted MesDPM triels with one alkyl and one halide substituent.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;responsive mononucleotide coacervates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) is central to the formation of biomolecular condensates in modern cells and is also explored as a mechanism for assembling protocells. Phase&#8208;separated droplets provide dynamic micro&#8208;environments that concentrate reactants, enhance reactions, and allow molecular exchange, essential for both cellular regulation and adaptive compartmentalization. While modern cells achieve dynamic LLPS through enzymatic and metabolic pathways, protocells may be designed to harness external stimuli such as pH, temperature, redox potential, or light. However, existing studies of light&#8208;responsive coacervates rely on complex biomolecules, limiting their use as minimal platforms of energy&#8208;driven phase separation. Here, we develop a minimal system of light&#8208;responsive coacervates composed of low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight species: mononucleotides and azobenzene&#8208;based amphiphiles with varying charge valency. These coacervates undergo reversible phase transitions through azobenzene photoisomerization, with their behavior governed by charge valency and nucleotide structure. We demonstrate that coacervates formed with high&#8208;valency azobenzenes remain stable under UV irradiation but exhibit significant property changes, while those with low&#8208;valency azobenzenes dissolve, enabling light&#8208;controlled nucleotide release. Additionally, we achieved hierarchical droplet organization and light&#8208;actuated biomolecular localization within multiphase systems. Overall, these findings establish a minimal platform for designing light&#8208;responsive synthetic protocells, providing insights into dynamic compartmentalization in de novo life&#8208;like systems.</dc:description>

         <title>SIMPLE LARGE&#8208;SCALE PREPARATION OF CARBON DOT COMPOSITES WITH HIGH LUMINESCENT PERFORMANCE</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>At present, the demand for high&#8208;performance and cost&#8208;effective luminescent materials has increasingly grown and carbon dots (CDs) stand out due to their distinctive advantages. However, their preparation and purification process are too complex to commercialize. Issues such as fluorescence quenching, low quantum yield of short&#8208;wavelength emission and short room temperature phosphorescence lifetimes still need to be addressed. Here, we successfully prepared CD composites on a large scale for the applications of deep&#8208;blue LEDs and phosphorescent encryption through the combination of several easy, controllable and repeatable strategys. Their luminescent properties are similar to the precursor and the luminescent performance are more excellent, achieving a fluorescence quantum yield of 65.46 % and a phosphorescence lifetime of 1489.2 ms. Through various characterizations, it was found that ammonia, polar groups and urea content affect the whole crystallization process of matrix. We put forward that surface free energy leads to different morphologys and the special structure of the composites which provide new ideas for the subsequent explain about reaction process between CDs and matrix. The success of the scale&#8208;up experiment demonstrates the potential for large&#8208;scale preparation of this scheme, thereby inspiring future large&#8208;scale production of solid CDs.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Nanochannels: Suprasome&#8208;Mediated Delivery of Ionophore To Regulate Transmembrane Zn2+ Ion Transport</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of synthetic ion channels and stimuli&#8208;responsive suprasomes represents two crucial yet largely disconnected areas of supramolecular chemistry. Herein, we demonstrated that suprasomes can effectively deliver hydrophobic synthetic ion transporters to lipid membranes, regulating physiologically significant transition metal ions and subsequently modulating activity within lipid&#8208;bound compartments. We showed that a potent bis(vinylbenzimidazole)phenol derivative self&#8208;assembles within the lipid bilayer to form a supramolecular nanochannel, which facilitates selective and efficient transport of Zn2+ ions from the external aqueous solution across the lipid bilayer and into the internal solution of large unilamellar vesicles via an electrogenic pathway. The hydrophobic ion transporter could also be delivered to lipid bilayers due to its inherent ability to form suprasomal assembly with &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD) through dynamic host&#8208;guest interactions. The Zn&#178;&#8314; ions serve as stimuli to disassemble the suprasomes and release the ion transporter, which further penetrates the bilayers of lipid vesicles and regulates transmembrane Zn2+ ion transport. The application of this strategy of stimuli&#8208;mediated delivery of synthetic ion transporters to regulate transmembrane Zn2+ ion transport showed antibacterial activities against Gram&#8208;positive, Gram&#8208;negative and drug&#8208;resistant bacterial cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Aryl and &#945;&#8208;Heteroaryl 4&#8208;Silyloxy Piperidines via a One&#8208;Pot Negishi Cross&#8208;Coupling Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct &#945;&#8208;arylation of a protected 4&#8208;hydroxy piperidine via a one&#8208;pot Negishi cross&#8208;coupling reaction is described. The methodology uses a single solvent, toluene, for the lithiation / transmetallation / Negishi sequence and 20 examples are presented. Of note, the high yielding cross&#8208;coupling of a range of pharmaceutically&#8208;relevant heteroaryl bromides is reported. The reactions show high levels of 2,4&#8208;cis&#8208;diastereoselectivity and further functionalisations are also described. Piperidine is the most common nitrogen heterocycle in approved drugs and our approach delivers such heterocycles via a direct diastereoselective &#945;&#8208;functionalisation of 4&#8208;substituted N&#8208;Boc piperidines; as such, the approach is ready to be utilised in the pharmaceutical industry.</dc:description>

         <title>Bis(10&#8208;oxacorrole) with Fused Pyridine as a Linker: Synthesis, Structure, and Interaction between the Subunits in the Neutral, Mono&#8208; and Dicationic States</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyridine&#8208;fused bis(oxacorrole)s are obtained by a Hantzsch&#8208;type cyclization using arylaldehydes and 3&#8208;amino&#8208;10&#8208;oxacorrole. Spectroscopic characteristics, corroborated by DFT calculations, indicate aromaticity of the dimer and strong interaction between the subunits. Electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical analyses indicate facile access to cation radicals and dicationic species. The oxidized forms are characterized by electronic and electron spin resonance spectroscopies as well as by DFT calculations. Monocations give rise to strong absorption bands in the NIR region between 1500 and 2500 nm, while dications are characterized by a series of absorptions between 1000 and 2200 nm. ESR and VT NMR experiments indicate the presence of singlet&#8208;triplet spin equilibria for the solution of the dication. For the dication of bis(oxacorrole) in the singlet ground state, neither aromaticity nor antiaromaticity has been detected by low&#8208;temperature 1H NMR and GIAO calculations despite delocalization of &#960;&#8208;electrons.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We herein developed a novel method for generating nitro radicals using sodium nitrite under electrocatalytic conditions for the first time. A series of vicinal hydroxynitro or chloronitro compounds was generated in good yields. This methodology features simple reaction setup, mild reaction conditions, and cheap electrodes, and simultaneously shows excellent functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope, enabling efficient gram&#8208;scale reactions with good to excellent yields. Besides, the EIS and CV results provided deeper insights into the reaction mechanism. Further extensions of the method have also confirmed the practicality of the strategy developed.</dc:description>

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Extended Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Molecular Bowls Comprising Adjacent Pentagons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While the classical buckybowls, such as corannulene, sumanene, have been extensively investigated, research on other molecular bowls containing double neighboring pentagonal rings remains underdeveloped. Here we present the synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;doped molecular bowls incorporating adjacent pentagonal motifs with an extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated surface. Their molecular curvatures are preserved according to the analyses of bowl&#8208;depth, &#960;&#8208;orbital axis vector angles and inversion energy barrier when compared to those of their parent structures.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;While the classical buckybowls, such as corannulene, sumanene, have been extensively investigated, research on other molecular bowls containing double neighboring pentagonal rings remains underdeveloped. Here we present the synthesis of nitrogen-doped molecular bowls incorporating adjacent pentagonal motifs with an extended &#960;-conjugated surface. Their molecular curvatures are preserved according to the analyses of bowl-depth, &#960;-orbital axis vector angles and inversion energy barrier when compared to those of their parent structures. The extended &#960;-conjugation induces the bathochromic shifts of both absorption and emission spectra, the narrowed energy gaps of the frontier molecular orbitals, as well as the enhanced aromatic character in the fused pentagonal rings. Furthermore, the extended aromatic surface enables the binding with fullerene C60 in solution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Integrating Electrochemical Electrodes Into Mass Spectrometry Ionization Sources for Detection of Transient Intermediates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; configuration for electrochemistry&#8208;mass spectrometry has proven to be powerful in detecting transient intermediates with lifetimes from second, milli&#8208;, micro&#8208;, to nano&#8208;, and even pico&#8208;seconds. This mini&#8208;review addresses the electrode&#8208;ion source integration strategies, mainly including exploiting inherent electrochemical properties, incorporating a two&#8208; or three&#8208;electrode system, and implementing bipolar electrodes.








Abstract
Identifying short&#8208;lived transient intermediates is challenging due to their brief lifetimes (as short as nanoseconds and even picoseconds) and therefore low concentrations in many chemical processes. Conducting electrochemical reactions within mass spectrometry ion sources (i.e., in&#8208;source or in situ EC&#8208;MS) offers the advantage of minimizing the distance between the electrodes and the mass spectrometer, thereby improving the detection of transient intermediates. However, a key challenge for in&#8208;source EC&#8208;MS is the effective integration of the electrodes into the MS ion sources. This mini&#8208;review highlights three main integration strategies: exploiting inherent electrochemical properties, incorporating a two&#8208; or three&#8208;electrode system, and implementing bipolar electrodes, focusing on the underlying mechanisms, experimental setups, and applications of these approaches. Future perspectives emphasize the directions of designing and modifying ionization sources, integrating electrocatalysis, enhancing transfer efficiency, developing automated screening platforms, as well as expanding practical applications.

&lt;p&gt;Identifying short-lived transient intermediates is challenging due to their brief lifetimes (as short as nanoseconds and even picoseconds) and therefore low concentrations in many chemical processes. Conducting electrochemical reactions within mass spectrometry ion sources (i.e., in-source or in situ EC-MS) offers the advantage of minimizing the distance between the electrodes and the mass spectrometer, thereby improving the detection of transient intermediates. However, a key challenge for in-source EC-MS is the effective integration of the electrodes into the MS ion sources. This mini-review highlights three main integration strategies: exploiting inherent electrochemical properties, incorporating a two- or three-electrode system, and implementing bipolar electrodes, focusing on the underlying mechanisms, experimental setups, and applications of these approaches.

         <title>Polyimides with Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer and Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Properties by End&#8208;capping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic polymers possessing excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) significantly impact their electronic and optical properties through stimulus response, leading to unique photoluminescence behaviors such as large Stokes shifts, dual emission, and environmental sensitivity. In this work, polyimides (PIs) exhibiting both ESIPT and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) properties were designed and synthesized by end&#8208;capping with 5&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl) benzothiazole (HBTA) and 5&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl) benzimidazole (HBIA), respectively. HBTA&#8208;PI and HBIA&#8208;PI exhibit bright yellow&#8208;green and sky&#8208;blue fluorescence at 510&#160;and 470 nm, with a relatively high photoluminescence quantum yields of about 27.2% and 25.1%, respectively. Importantly, HBTA&#8208;PI and HBIA&#8208;PI show excellent room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence emissions at 520&#160;and 485 nm, with decay lifetimes of 76.5 ms and 53.2 ms. The theoretical results indicate that the effective and large spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) constants from their keto forms in the excited state can enhance the intersystem crossing (ISC) process to produce triplet excitons. The rigid polyimide networks further inhibit the non&#8208;radiative decay of triplet excitons and enhance phosphorescence emission. Additionally, the excellent ESIPT properties of HBTA&#8208;PI and HBIA&#8208;PI enable the detection of HCl vapor, which induces multiple fluorescent and phosphorescent color changes. This work provides good examples of polyimides for organic polymers with ESIPT properties and multi&#8208;stimulus response emissions.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Total Synthesis of Lansai B</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lansai B was obtained in a chemoenzymatic approach from the small building block 5&#8208;bromoindole utilizing two enzymes. Applying a tryptophan synthase and a further characterized C3&#8208;methyltransferase the sterically demanding framework is constructed within just six steps. After late&#8208;stage Suzuki&#8208;coupling and n&#8208;methylation the natural product was isolated.








Abstract
Lansai B is an indole alkaloid whose biosynthesis is not yet elucidated. However, utilizing nature's tools enabled the stereoselective formation of this unique framework, first by providing the substituted tryptophan as starting material and later in the scaffold&#8208;building step forming the pyrroloindole motif. For the latter, the C3&#8208;methyltransferase from Streptomyces griseoviridis (SgMT) is employed for the diastereoselective methylation. Investigating the scope of the enzyme proved that introducing a bromide in the 5&#8208;position was ideal for the synthetic endeavor. With this, the stage was set for the synthesis of lansai&#160;B, introducing the prenyl group late via a Suzuki coupling.

         <title>A Fluorescent Aptasensor for Sensitive and Selective Determination of Epigenetic Cancer Biomarker N1&#8208;Methyladenosine in Urine Samples</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Using N1&#8208;methyladenosine, a cancer biomarker as a target, a highly selective DNA aptamer was obtained with excellent selectivity and affinity, allowing the detection with a limit of detection of 1.9&#160;&#181;m.








Abstract
N1&#8208;methyladenosine (m1A) level in urine increases in the presence of cancer and is associated with the tumor size and stage. In the present study, we aimed to develop a method for rapid, sensitive and accurate determination of m1A in urine samples. The capture systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) method was used to isolate aptamers that could selectively bind to m1A. We successfully isolated two sequences that have high selectivity toward m1A. The affinities against m1A were determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and thioflavin T (ThT) assays. The N1MA1a aptamer has a Kd of 1.9&#177;0.1&#160;&#181;m determined by the ThT assay and 0.75&#177;0.04&#160;&#181;m determined by ITC. A strand&#8208;displacement biosensor was designed by labeling the aptamer with a carboxy fluorescein (FAM) and hybridizing it with a quencher&#8208;labeled complementary DNA strand. Using this biosensing system, m1A was detected with a detection limit of 1.9&#160;&#181;m. The system shows high selectivity to m1A and high tolerance to adenosine, cytidine, guanosine, thymidine, uridine and N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A) as well as urine constituents at their real levels in urine. The sensor has been applied to five different human urine samples showing quantitative recovery values, which indicates practical potential of this aptamer&#8208;based biosensor.

         <title>Infrared Irradiation&#8208;Assisted Green Approach for Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig Amination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, infrared (IR) irradiation is demonstrated as an effective energy source, able to assist the Pd&#8208;catalyzed Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig amination. The C&#8211;N coupling reactions were performed under quasi&#8208;solvent&#8208;free conditions, in nonanhydrous conditions and without the exclusion of air, using aryl iodides and bromides functionalized with both electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, along with a variety of secondary and primary amines.








Abstract
We report a novel and green approach for Pd&#8208;catalyzed Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig amination, assisted by Infrared (IR) irradiation under quasi&#8208;solvent&#8208;free conditions, in a nonanhydrous environment, and without the exclusion of air. The C&#8211;N coupling reactions, performed with a stoichiometric amount of cyclopentyl methyl ether, proceed with moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields using aryl iodides and bromides bearing both electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, along with a variety of secondary and primary amines.

         <title>Highly Emissive Flexible Organic Crystals with Broad Piezochromism and Optical Waveguides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic single crystals have been designed with a rigid benzothiadiazole planar core and fluorinated terminal moieties that enable both strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and halogen/hydrogen bonding. This synergistic interplay endows the flexible crystals with exceptional optomechanical responses, namely, a remarkable piezochromic range (&#916;&#955;&#160;=&#160;171 nm) andoptical waveguiding characteristics (0.286&#8211;0.529 dB mm&#8315;&#185;).








Abstract
The integration of mechanical flexibility with stimuli&#8208;responsive optical properties in organic single crystals (OSCs) remains a formidable challenge due to the intrinsic rigidity of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems. Herein, we report a rationally designed OSC, FBCF, that synergistically combines elastic deformability, broad piezochromism, and optical waveguides via a planar benzothiadiazole (BTA) core and fluoroarene termini. The molecular architecture enforces face&#8208;to&#8208;face slip&#8208;stacking via multiple noncovalent interactions (N&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;H, &#960;&#8208;&#960;, and C&#8208;F&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#960;), yielding centimeter&#8208;scale crystals with exceptional elastic bending and full recovery. These crystals exhibit high photoluminescence (PL) efficiency (PLQY&#160;=&#160;75.8%) and serve as optical waveguides, maintaining performance even when bent (optical loss coefficients (OLCs): 0.286&#8211;0.529&#160;dB mm&#8722;1). Crucially, FBCF exhibits broad pressure&#8208;responsive spectral shifts (&#916;&#955;&#160;=&#160;171&#160;nm), achieving a piezochromic sensitivity of 16.7&#160;nm GPa&#8722;1, exceeding that of most organic systems. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses reveal hierarchical packing: rigid lamellar layers (stabilized by strong &#960;&#8208;&#960;/dipole interactions, &#8208;118.56 to &#8209;58.45&#160;kcal/mol) interconnected via weaker interlayer C&#8208;F&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#960; bonds (&#8722;18.8&#160;kcal/mol). This architecture enables elastic deformation through interlayer slippage while preserving intralayer order.

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Activity Evaluation of Methylene&#8208;H4MPT Mimics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic strategy was applied in the design and synthesis of mimic models for methylene&#8208;tetrahydromethanopterin (methylene&#8208;H4MPT), a key coenzyme in archaeal metabolism. We identify highly effective mimics, demonstrating considerable enzymatic efficiency in hydride transfer reactions. Our study provides valuable insights into the structure&#8208;function relationship of methylene&#8208;H4MPT and offers useful mimic models for studying archaeal metabolism and synthetic one&#8208;carbon (C1) utilization systems

Abstract
Tetrahydromethanopterin (H4MPT) is a specialized coenzyme found in methanogenic archaea and methylotrophic bacteria, essential for one&#8208;carbon (C1) transfer and redox reactions in processes like methanogenesis. However, its structural complexity and limited availability hinder its use in studying archaeal metabolism and H4MPT&#8208;dependent enzymes. Inspired by the success of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) (NAD(P)H) biomimetic compounds, we employed a similar structural simplification strategy for methylene&#8208;H4MPT, designing four mimics (mimics 1&#8211;4) that retain the crucial hydride&#8208;donating imidazolidine unit while modifying the pterin structure and hydrophilic tail. Structural and crystallographic analysis of methylene&#8208;H4MPT&#8208;bound enzymes, including H4MPT&#8208;dependent formaldehyde&#8208;activating enzyme MtdA and H4MPT&#8208;dependent formaldehyde&#8208;activating enzyme Fae, highlighted the importance of the pterin group in hydrogen bonding and active site interactions. Activity evaluation of the mimics in hydride transfer assays and relay reactions with MtdA and NADPH&#8208;dependent ketoreductase CgKR1 showed that the pterin structure is critical for enzymatic activity, and improving water solubility via hydrophilic tail modification enhances performance. This biomimetic approach offers functional substitutes for methylene&#8208;H4MPT and potentially valuable tools for studying archaeal metabolism and synthetic microbial systems for C1 compound utilization.

         <title>Photoinduced Stable Circularly Polarized Luminescent Radicals From a Triphenylamine&#8208;Attached Planar Chiral Pillar[5]Arene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we present a photoactivation approach to generate a stable circularly polarized luminescent free radical from triphenylamine&#8208;functionalized &#960;&#8208;conjugated planar chiral pillar[5]arene (EtP5NN) with sky&#8208;blue emission in the solid state. Theoretical calculations and experiments have demonstrated that the EtP5NN generated triphenylamine radical following exposure to UV irradiation, while the pillar[5]arene ring effectively stabilized the free radical species.








Abstract
Photoinduced organic radicals with unique luminescent properties are highly sought&#8208;after due to their important prospects in synthetic chemistry and materials science. However, the current development of organic free radicals, including photoinduced ones, is significantly limited and faces challenges related to stability and poor luminescence behavior. Taking advantage of the photoelectric activity of triarylamine, we herein describe an unusual luminescent radical, which can be rapidly generated by UV irradiation of a solid&#8208;state triarylamine&#8208;functionalized &#960;&#8208;conjugated pillar[5]arene (EtP5NN) in air, accompanied by luminescent color switching from bluish&#8208;violet to sky&#8208;blue. The persistent radicals within EtP5NN with a half&#8208;life of 12.7 h suggest that the pillar[5]arene skeleton straightforwardly improves the stability of radicals. The sterically bulky triarylamine groups inhibit the racemization of planar chiral pillar[5]arene and allow the optical resolution of this system. The enhancement of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is triggered by UV irradiation of the enantiomers (pS/pR&#8208;EtP5NN) in the solid state.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence Inversion Induced by Achiral Dyes in Organogels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CPL signals inversion in two binary supramolecular gels were observed which was attributed to the different hydrogen bonding&#8208;induced assemblies in two organogels, implying the interaction between chiral gelator and non&#8208;chiral fluorophore could regulate the sign of CPL signals.








Abstract
Supramolecular assembly strategy is widely applied to develop circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials, especially for centrally chiral systems. The CPL sign of supramolecular gels based on a centrally chiral compound is generally regulated by employing the opposite chiral enantiomers. However, controlling CPL signals by regulating the interaction model between the achiral fluorophore and chiral gelator, accompanied by the adjustment of the emission wavelength, remains challenging. Herein, we have developed binary supramolecular gels based on achiral cyanostilbene derivatives and a chiral gelator. Two binary supramolecular gels have displayed achiral fluorophore&#8208;induced CPL sign inversion, attributed to the hydrogen bonding interaction between the carboxyl group of two fluorophores and the amino group of chiral gelator. This work reveals a rational approach to the design of CPL material with tunable CPL sign and CPL emission wavelength.

&lt;p&gt;CPL signals inversion in two binary supramolecular gels were observed which was attributed to the different hydrogen bonding-induced assemblies in two organogels, implying the interaction between chiral gelator and non-chiral fluorophore could regulate the sign of CPL signals.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supramolecular assembly strategy is widely applied to develop circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials, especially for centrally chiral systems. The CPL sign of supramolecular gels based on a centrally chiral compound is generally regulated by employing the opposite chiral enantiomers. However, controlling CPL signals by regulating the interaction model between the achiral fluorophore and chiral gelator, accompanied by the adjustment of the emission wavelength, remains challenging. Herein, we have developed binary supramolecular gels based on achiral cyanostilbene derivatives and a chiral gelator. Two binary supramolecular gels have displayed achiral fluorophore-induced CPL sign inversion, attributed to the hydrogen bonding interaction between the carboxyl group of two fluorophores and the amino group of chiral gelator. This work reveals a rational approach to the design of CPL material with tunable CPL sign and CPL emission wavelength.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Making and Breaking Supramolecular Synthons for Modular Protein Frameworks</title>

Calixarenes are useful tools for protein crystal engineering. With the model protein RSL, different calixarene dimers generate distinct frameworks. An N&#8208;terminal macrocycle binding tag serves to expand the structural landscape.








Abstract
Anionic calixarenes are useful mediators of protein assembly. In some cases, protein &#8211; calixarene cocrystallization yields multiple polymorphs. Ralstonia solanacearum lectin (RSL) cocrystallizes with p&#8208;sulfonato&#8208;calix[8]arene (sclx8) in at least four distinct pH&#8208;dependent arrangements. One of these polymorphs, occurring at pH &#8804; 4, is a cubic framework in which RSL nodes are connected by sclx8 dimers. These dimers are supramolecular synthons that occur in distinct crystal structures. Now, we show that the discus&#8208;shaped dimer of p&#8208;phosphonato&#8208;calix[6]arene (pclx6), can replace the sclx8 dimer yielding a new assembly of RSL. Remarkably, just one type of RSL &#8211; pclx6 cocrystal was formed, irrespective of pH or crystallization condition. These results with pclx6 contrast starkly with sclx8 and suggest that the calixarene type (e.g., phosphonate versus sulfonate) dictates the synthon durability, which in turn exerts control over protein assembly and polymorph selection. Breaking the pclx6 dimer required a mutant of RSL with an affinity tag for macrocycle binding. This highly accessible, dicationic site resulted in a significantly altered and porous framework with pclx6 (but not with sclx8). Experiments with ternary mixtures of RSL, pclx6, and sclx8 provide evidence of pH&#8208;driven self&#8208;sorting. Thus, the &#8220;mix&#8208;and&#8208;match&#8221; of protein and supramolecular synthons is a promising approach to protein crystal engineering.

         <title>Development of Eco&#8208;Friendly Thermosetting Resins From Zein and Diglycidyl Ether of Vanillyl Alcohol. A Step Toward Sustainable Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study represents a groundbreaking achievement in material science by introducing Zein, a natural and renewable protein, as an active crosslinker in biobased DGEVA epoxy thermosetting resins. Its uniqueness lies in demonstrating how a plant&#8208;derived byproduct can be effectively integrated into synthetic polymer matrices, resulting in materials with enhanced thermal stability, improved mechanical properties, and tunable shape memory effects. Beyond its chemical innovation, the study aligns with global sustainability goals, offering a compelling alternative to petroleum&#8208;based resins and reducing environmental impact.








Abstract
Herein, bisphenol A&#8208;free, biobased, and sustainable thermosets were obtained for the first time by using two naturally derived compounds. Zein, a renewable biopolymer extracted from maize, exhibited excellent reactivity and versatility, while the diglycidyl ether of vanillyl alcohol (DGEVA), a biobased epoxy monomer derived from vanillin, served as a sustainable alternative to petrochemical epoxides. By chemically integrating Zein into DGEVA thermosetting networks, environmentally friendly resins with excellent thermomechanical properties were developed. A comprehensive analysis of seven formulations, incorporating up to 30&#160;wt.% Zein, provided critical insights into the relationship between protein content and resin properties. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis highlighted a strong interaction between Zein and DGEVA's epoxy groups, resulting in significantly higher polymerization enthalpies compared to neat DGEVA homopolymerization. This indicates the formation of robust crosslinked networks driven by Zein's multifunctional groups. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) demonstrated substantial improvements in the thermosets&#8217; glass transition (Tg), with values increasing from 52&#176;C in neat DGEVA to 73&#176;C in DGEVA/30% Zein systems, indicating enhanced stiffness and thermal performance. Furthermore, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) confirmed good thermal stability of the bioresins, with degradation temperatures exceeding 300&#176;C. Beyond these technical achievements, this study underscores the broader significance of incorporating Zein, a byproduct of corn agriculture, into biobased thermosets.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Mediated Polymers: Strengthening, Toughening, and Stabilizing Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Concept article presents a new paradigm in polymer innovation through the fabrication of hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated polymers (HBMPs) by judiciously tuning interchain/intersegment H&#8208;bonding interactions alongside the rational design of covalent polymer structures. It explores the impact of hydrogen&#8208;bond multivalence cooperativity and dynamicity on the mechanical properties, stability, and sustainability of polymers, offering a pathway for advanced and sustainable material development.








Abstract
Traditionally, the design and synthesis of polymers have centered on engineering their covalent chain or network structures. However, noncovalent interactions between polymer chains can influence the properties of polymers to a degree comparable to or even greater than their covalent structures. Therefore, shifting the focus of polymer design from covalent structure engineering to noncovalent interaction modulation represents a new paradigm for polymer innovation. This concept article summarizes our recent advances in H&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated polymers (HBMPs), fabricated by meticulously tuning the interchain/intersegment H&#8208;bonding interactions, in conjunction with rational design of the covalent polymer chain or network structures. We demonstrate that H&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated assembly provides an effective strategy to fabricate new polymers with unprecedented properties and sustainability, using commodity polymers as building blocks. Importantly, the synergy of multivalence cooperativity and dynamic nature of the H&#8208;bonding interactions in HBMPs can reconcile the intrinsic trade&#8208;off between mechanical strength and toughness of polymers, achieving both superhigh strength and superhigh toughness. Moreover, optimizing multivalence cooperativity can make the H&#8208;bonded crosslinks exhibit a covalent crosslinking effect, offering thermoset&#8208;like stability while preserving thermoplastic&#8208;like recyclability. The concept of HBMPs can be extended to noncovalent&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated systems, opening new avenues for polymer innovation and expanding the potential for creating functional and sustainable materials.

         <title>A Cytotoxic Indazole&#8208;based Gold(III) Carboxamide Pincer Complex Targeting DNA Through Dual Binding Modes of Groove Binding and Alkylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Toward new gold(III) anticancer agents. Herein, we report on an indazole&#8208;based gold(III) carboxamide pincer complex exhibiting significant cytotoxicity, likely mediated through dual interactions with DNA. Mechanistic investigations suggest that the complex binds to the DNA and forms specific interactions with nucleotide bases. Structural studies with thymine reveal its DNA base recognition mechanism, offering insights into its anticancer activity.








Abstract
Gold(III) complexes have garnered increasing attention in drug delivery due to their structural and mechanistic similarities to cisplatin. This study investigates an indazole&#8208;based gold(III) carboxamide pincer complex, [N2&#183;N6&#8208;bis(1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;indazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)pyridine&#8208;2&#183;6&#8208;dicarboxamide]gold(III) chloride (AuL), for its potential as an anticancer agent. Speciation analysis at physiological pH revealed that AuL predominantly exists as a neutral chlorinated species. The complex exhibited strong cytotoxicity against the MCF&#8208;7 breast cancer cell line, with an impressive IC50 value of 9&#160;&#181;M, while showing no significant activity against the HT&#8208;29 colon cancer cell line. Comprehensive analysis using electrophoresis, viscometry, ultraviolet&#8208;visible spectroscopy (UV&#8208;Vis), circular dichroism (CD), linear dichroism (LD) spectroscopy, and biomolecular simulations demonstrated that AuL binds to DNA via a dual mechanism, specifically minor groove binding and alkylation, with binding constants Ka1 = 1.48 &#215; 109 M&#8722;1 and Ka2 = 6.59 &#215; 105 M&#8722;1, respectively. Our data indicate that AuL initially binds to the minor groove of DNA, at which point a nucleobase substitutes the Cl ion, resulting in AuL binding directly to the DNA bases. In conclusion, the dual binding mode of AuL with DNA underscores its potential as a promising anticancer agent, opening new avenues for drug discovery and the development of metal&#8208;based therapeutics.

Comprehensive analysis using electrophoresis, viscometry, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), circular dichroism (CD), linear dichroism (LD) spectroscopy, and biomolecular simulations demonstrated that &lt;b&gt;AuL&lt;/b&gt; binds to DNA via a dual mechanism, specifically minor groove binding and alkylation, with binding constants &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.48 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and K&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt; = 6.59 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. Our data indicate that &lt;b&gt;AuL&lt;/b&gt; initially binds to the minor groove of DNA, at which point a nucleobase substitutes the Cl ion, resulting in &lt;b&gt;AuL&lt;/b&gt; binding directly to the DNA bases. In conclusion, the dual binding mode of &lt;b&gt;AuL&lt;/b&gt; with DNA underscores its potential as a promising anticancer agent, opening new avenues for drug discovery and the development of metal-based therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

New green routes to fused heterocycles: Choline chloride (ChCl)/urea (1/2&#160;mol/mol) deep eutectic solvent (DES) is used as both recyclable reaction medium and promoter for the base&#8208;free iodocyclization of 3&#8208;alkynylthiophene&#8208;2&#8208;carboxamides to 4&#8208;iodo&#8208;7H&#8208;thieno[2,3&#8208;c]pyran&#8208;7&#8208;imines. Recyclable DESs ChCl/Gly (1/2&#160;mol/mol, Gly = glycerol) and Bet/Gly (1/2&#160;mol/mol, Bet = betaine) are successfully used for subsequent Sonogashira and Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura couplings, respectively.








Abstract
A green approach to a previously unknown class of iodine&#8208;containing heterocycles, namely 4&#8208;iodo&#8208;7H&#8208;thieno[2,3&#8208;c]pyran&#8208;7&#8208;imines, by iodocyclization of readily available 3&#8208;alkynylthiophene&#8208;2&#8208;carboxamides in a deep eutectic solvent (DES) as both solvent and promoter, has been developed. We have found that, while the reaction with I2 and K2CO3 as the base in a classical volatile organic solvent proceeded to a very limited extent, the iodocyclization was successful when performed under neutral conditions in choline chloride/urea (1/2 molar ratio). Moreover, the DES could be efficiently recycled several times without a significant decrease in the product yield. The promoting effect of the DES has been studied in detail using computational methods. The possibility to further decorate the newly synthesized iodinated heterocycles in a DES solvent (choline chloride/glycerol, 1/2 molar ratio, for Sonogashira reaction, and betaine/glycerol, 1/2 molar ratio, for Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling) has been successfully assessed, and the solvent&#8208;catalyst system was recycled several times without appreciable loss of activity. A computational study on the effect of the betaine/glycerol system in the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling has also been carried out, while the structures of representative products have been confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

         <title>Construction of a Cyclic Regular&#8208;Triangle Trimer of Cytochrome c555 with a Central Hole Using Sortase A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CL&#8208;(c555)3 is a cyclic and symmetric regular&#8208;triangle building block protein that comprises three Aquifex aeolicus cytochrome c555 molecules and three &#945;&#8208;helical linkers. It was designed and constructed by covalently connecting the amino acid termini using sortase A&#8208;mediated ligation. CL&#8208;(c555)3 was assembled into a nanoporous supramolecular structure with approximately 16 and 30 &#197;&#8208;diameter pores in the crystal.








Abstract
Protein&#8208;based supramolecules require precise arrangement of building blocks. A regular&#8208;triangle trimer (cp&#8208;c555)3 has been constructed using an &#945;&#8208;helix&#8208;inserted&#8208;circular permutant (cp&#8208;c555) of Aquifex aeolicus cytochrome (cyt) c555, where the trimers may dissociate to monomers. In this study, we stabilized the regular&#8208;triangle structure by constructing a cyclic regular&#8208;triangle of three &#945;&#8208;helix&#8208;linked cyt c555 molecules using sortase&#8208;mediated ligation (SML). Comparing SML using sortase A for six cp&#8208;c555 variant trimers, the variant with GGG at the N&#8208;terminus and LPETG at the C&#8208;terminus reacted most efficiently. OP&#8208;(c555)3 was designed, in which two cyt c555 molecules were fused using an &#945;&#8208;helix, generating a dimer. The cyt c555 C&#8208;terminal region was attached to the N&#8208;terminus of the dimer, and the cyt c555 N&#8208;terminal region was attached to the C&#8208;terminus of the dimer using the same &#945;&#8208;helix. OP&#8208;(c555)3 was expressed in Escherichia coli cells, and the termini were connected by SML, forming a cyclic regular&#8208;triangle, CL&#8208;(c555)3. CL&#8208;(c555)3 showed higher thermostability than (cp&#8208;c555)3 and OP&#8208;(c555)3. CL&#8208;(c555)3 structural stability was confirmed using high&#8208;speed atomic force microscopy. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure of CL&#8208;(c555)3 showed a cyclic structure and a nanoporous supramolecular assembly. These results demonstrate that a nanoporous supramolecular assembly can be constructed by designing a cyclic molecule with a central hole using SML.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Triazolobenzodiazepine Hybrids: A Catalyst&#8208;Free on&#8208;Resin Strategy to Build Complex Therapeutic Motifs Into Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a catalyst&#8208;free, on&#8208;resin method for synthesizing peptide&#8208;triazolobenzodiazepine hybrids. The SPPS&#8208;compatible protocol enables N&#8208;terminal and Lys/Orn side chain modifications, forming a triazolobenzodiazepine core via one&#8208;pot reactions. The methodology offers a versatile tool for advancing &#8220;peptide medicinal chemistry&#8221; enabling the design of multifunctional peptides with potential therapeutic applications.








Abstract
The merger of peptide and heterocyclic chemistry presents significant opportunities for enhancing the structural and functional diversity of therapeutic agents. In this study, we introduce a streamlined on&#8208;resin method to modify peptides at the N&#8208;terminus amines and the side chain amines of Lys/Orn amino acids by incorporating the biologically active triazolobenzodiazepine scaffold. In the presented solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis (SPPS), the triazolobenzodiazepine core is formed on&#8208;resin through a combination of N&#8208;alkylation, amide bond formation, and an alkyne&#8208;azide 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition, of which the latter two happen as a single&#8208;step one&#8208;pot reaction&#8208; proceeding under mild conditions without metal catalysts. This protocol tolerates a wide variety of amino acids and functional groups, providing a versatile method for synthesizing peptide&#8208;triazolobenzodiazepine hybrids. Using orthogonal protection group strategies, we further demonstrate the method's adaptability for two site modifications in peptides involving both the N&#8208;terminus and Lys side chain amines. These modifications enhance the scope of &#8220;peptide medicinal chemistry&#8221; by creating multifunctional peptides with potential therapeutic applications. The method's compatibility with SPPS, room temperature conditions, and elimination of metal catalysis make it an efficient and powerful tool for peptide modification.

         <title>Models for the Anionic Polymerization of P&#9552;C Bonds: Cyclization of n&#8208;BuLi&#8208;Initiated MesP&#9552;CPh2 and Related Phosphaalkenes with H2C&#9552;CPh2</title>

         <dc:description>
Noninnocence of P&#8208;Mesityl substituent, cleavage of a P&#9552;C bond and cyclization are observed in reactions of five phosphaalkenes. The observed activation of the C&#9472;H bond of the Mesityl substituent and subsequent addition to nonpolymerizable H2C&#9552;CPh2 is examined as a potential clue to the polymerization mechanism for P&#8208;Mesityl phosphaalkenes.








Abstract
To model the first propagation step in the anionic polymerization of MesP&#9552;CPh2 we studied the addition of Li[MesP(Bu)&#8211;CPh2] (and related species) to nonpolymerizable H2C&#9552;CPh2. Addition proceeds via the o&#8208;CH3 of the P&#8208;Mes followed by unprecedented cyclization to C5P&#8208;rings with release of Li[CHPh2]. Further investigation of the aforementioned reaction using phosphaalkenes, RP&#9552;CAr2 (R &#9552; Mes, m&#8208;Xyl; R&#8242; &#9552; Ph, 4&#8208;FC6H4, 4&#8208;MeC6H4, 4&#8208;MeOC6H4), resulted in the observation of a relatively long&#8208;lived intermediate in two instances (R &#9552; Mes, R&#8217; = 4&#8208;MeC6H4, 4&#8208;MeOC6H4). For the latter, the intermediate was identified as n&#8208;BuP(CH(4&#8208;MeOC6H4)2)[C6(4,6&#8208;Me2)H2&#8211;(2&#8208;CH2CH2CPh2Li) by isolation of the oxidized, H+&#8208;quenched product. These observations provide intriguing clues into the complex mechanism of polymerization of P&#8208;Mes phosphaalkenes and the chiral cyclophosphane products are of interest as ligands for catalytic applications.

         <title>A Highly Chemically Robust 2D Zn&#8208;MOF as Promising Adsorbent for One&#8208;Step Methane Purification From Multicomponent Gas Mixtures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemically robust and easily scalable 2D Zn&#8208;MOF (IITKGP&#8208;27) was strategically designed and developed for one&#8208;step methane purification from multicomponent mixtures of light C2&#8208;hydrocarbons and CO2 gases with a nice trade&#8208;off between high sorption capacities, moderate selectivity and low regeneration cost even at ambient conditions benefiting from its microporous structure with abundant uncoordinated interaction sites.








Abstract
One&#8208;step CH4 purification from C2&#8208;hydrocarbons and CO2 gas impurities is essential in the quest for clean energy resources amidst the growing energy crisis. While MOF materials have demonstrated significant progress in binary C2H2/CH4,&#160;C2H4/CH4,&#160;C2H6/CH4, and CO2/CH4&#160;separations, there is a growing emphasis on the purification of CH4 from multicomponent gas mixtures using a single adsorbent. Toward this direction, a 2D MOF: IITKGP&#8208;27, {[Zn(MBPz) (SO2DBA)]&#183;4H2O}n featuring rhombus pores decorated with polar functionalities has been strategically constructed displaying remarkable chemical robustness in water for 7 days, across a wide range of aqueous pH solutions (pH&#160;=&#160;2&#8211;12), and in open air for 30 days. Interestingly, IITKGP&#8208;27 selectively adsorb C2 hydrocarbons (C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6) and CO2 over CH4, attributed to the synergistic effect of favorable host&#8211;guest (C2S and CO2) interactions due to the presence of accessible surface functionalities and optimal pore apertures. Moreover, an excellent trade&#8208;off between high sorption capacities and moderate separation selectivities was achieved. Transient breakthrough simulations further validated its feasibility toward unexplored CH4 purification from a blend of all such five gases mimicking natural gas composition, demonstrating its viability for this critical application. In addition, the facile bulk scalability, ease of regeneration, excellent recyclability, and outstanding structural stability highlight its potential as a robust solution for efficient CH4 purification from natural gas streams.

         <title>Crystal Structure Engineering Enables Enhanced Ionic Conductivity in LAGP Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aiming to optimize the ionic conductivity of LAGP solid electrolyte, the regulation of crystal framework of electrolyte was studied. By simply substituting commonly used &#945;&#8208;Al2O3 with &#947;&#8208;Al2O3, the optimized &#947;&#8208;Al2O3&#8208;derived LAGP achieves a threefold enhancement in total ion conductivity, reaching 6.04 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (SSLBs) have emerged as promising energy storage systems, offering superior safety and energy density compared to conventional liquid electrolyte&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Among solid&#8208;state electrolytes, NASICON&#8208;type lithium aluminum germanium phosphate (LAGP) has attracted significant attention due to its exceptional air stability and wide electrochemical window. However, its practical ionic conductivity remains substantially below theoretical predictions. This study demonstrates a crystal structure engineering strategy using &#947;&#8208;Al2O3 instead of conventional &#945;&#8208;Al2O3 as the aluminum source. The weaker Al&#9472;O bonds and higher reactivity of &#947;&#8208;Al2O3 facilitate increased Al3&#8314; incorporation into the LAGP framework, enhancing free Li&#8314; concentration at M2 sites and boosting bulk ionic conductivity. Furthermore, &#947;&#8208;Al2O3 addition reduces AlPO4 impurities and improves morphological uniformity, thereby optimizing grain boundary conductivity. The optimized &#947;&#8208;Al2O3&#8208;derived LAGP achieves a threefold enhancement in lithium&#8208;ion conductivity, reaching 6.04 &#215; 10&#8722;4 (total) and 2.77 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 (intracrystalline), representing a significant advancement in solid electrolyte performance.

         <title>Photocatalytic Hydrophosphination Using Calcium Precatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrophosphination using calcium compounds as catalysts under irradiation is described as a foray into s&#8208;block photocatalysis. Transition&#8208;metal compounds have been highly successful hydrophosphination catalysts under photochemical conditions, utilizing substrates previously considered inaccessible. A calcium hydrophosphination precatalyst, Ca(nacnac)(THF)(N(SiMe3)2) (1, nacnac = HC[(C(Me)N&#8208;2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3)]2), reported by Barrett and Hill, as well as the presumed intermediate, Ca(nacnac)(THF)(PPh2) (2), and the Schlenk equilibrium product, Ca[N(SiMe3)2]2(THF)2 (3) were screened under photochemical conditions with a range of unsaturated substrates including styrenic alkenes, Michael acceptors, and dienes with modest to excellent conversions, though unactivated alkenes were inaccessible. All compounds exhibit enhanced catalysis under irradiation by LED&#8208;generated blue light. Nacnac&#8208;supported compounds generate radicals as evidenced by EPR spectroscopy and radical trapping reactions, whereas unsupported calcium compounds are EPR silent and appear to undergo hydrophosphination akin to thermal reactions with these compounds. These results buttress the notion that photoactivation of &#960;&#8208;basic ligands is a broad phenomenon, extending beyond the d&#8208;block, but like d&#8208;block metals, consideration of ancillary ligands is essential to avoid radical reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of C4&#8208;Acyl Glycosides by Cross&#8208;Ketonization: The Importance of Precise Temperature Control in Photochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe herein a method for the synthesis of reversed C&#8208;acyl glycosides by direct cross&#8208;ketonization of linear carboxylic acids with carboxy sugars under metallaphotoredox conditions. This reaction proves to be highly sensitive to reaction temperature, with the reproducibility and yield of ketonization highly dependent upon precise temperature control. Analysis of the reaction mechanism suggests this sensitivity reflects the need to match the rate of Ni catalytic turnover with the rate of photocatalytic decarboxylation of the carboxy sugar. The insights gained from this study have important implications for the study of all metallaphotoredox reactions as well as other photoreactions that involve dual catalytic cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking the Room Temperature Phosphorescence through Halogen Engineering in Carbazole Dimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in metal&#8208;free organic materials offers immense potential for advanced optoelectronic applications. However, the rational design and fine&#8208;tuning of RTP remain challenging due to the complex correlation between molecular structure and photophysical processes. Herein, we explored the impact of intersystem crossing (ISC), spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC), and halogen interactions to promote RTP in crystalline brominated carbazole dimer (BrCz&#8208;D). In contrast, the unsubstituted analogue, Cz&#8208;D exhibits thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) under ambient conditions. Femtosecond transient absorption (fsTA) spectroscopy measurements confirmed the population of triplet manifolds in both dimers. Bromine substitution significantly enhances spin&#8208;orbit coupling (VSOC = 23.22 cm&#8722;1), enabling efficient ISC and robust RTP in BrCz&#8208;D. Enhanced RTP in crystalline BrCz&#8208;D is attributed to unique halogen interactions, including Br&#183;&#183;&#183;Br, C&#183;&#183;&#183;Br, and H&#183;&#183;&#183;Br, within the crystal lattice. Such halogen interactions are negligible in the solution state, accounting for the lack of RTP under ambient conditions. The present work highlights the critical role of SOC and halogen bonding in achieving efficient RTP for designing high&#8208;performance organic phosphorescent materials through crystallochemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>A Tetrazine&#8208;Based Synthesis for Accessing Underutilized Aza&#8208;Indole Analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr)/Diels&#8211;Alder (DA)/retro Diels&#8211;Alder (rDA) reaction cascade has been developed to access pyrazolo[3,4&#8208;c]pyridazine compounds. These cores have been further derivatized through divergent, late&#8208;stage modifications to access various substitution patterns of the 3, 4, and 5 positions on the heterocyclic core.







Abstract
Aza&#8208;indole functionalities fill an important role in drug discovery. While indoles are considered privileged scaffolds, aza&#8208;indoles allow for better pharmacological properties and on&#8208;target activities. Synthetic approaches to access aza&#8208;indoles are limited, with pyrazolopyridazines being some of the scarcest aza&#8208;indoles. To provide access to these underutilized cores, a synthetic approach utilizing a reaction cascade between a protected propargylhydrazine and dichlorotetrazine has been developed. In addition, a variety of methods were developed to access each position on the core for late&#8208;stage functionalization. This method offers an expedited synthetic route to a rare aza&#8208;indole scaffold with superior physiochemical properties when compared to indole analogues.

         <title>Photoinduced Electron Transfer in Ruthenium&#8208;Polypyridyl&#8208;Modified Laccases: Probing Pathways From the Surface to the Metal Centers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates photoinduced electron transfer (PIET) within a multicopper oxidase by grafting a ruthenium&#8208;polypyridyl photosensitizer onto different positions on its surface. We uncover alternative ET pathways to the enzyme's copper centers, in which the trinuclear cluster is photoreduced directly without first passing through the Type 1 copper center, influencing the efficiency of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Our findings provide insights for designing advanced photocatalytic systems and artificial photosynthetic molecular machines.








Abstract
This study explores the grafting of a ruthenium&#8208;polypyridyl photosensitizer onto the surface of a multi&#8208;copper oxidase to investigate photoinduced electron transfer (PIET) processes within the enzyme. Four Ru&#8208;laccase covalent hybrids unique in the position of the ruthenium complex relative to the Type 1 copper (T1) and trinuclear copper (TNC) centers of the enzyme are compared. The strategic positioning of the photosensitizer highlights the roles of distance and intervening medium on PIET pathways. Our results reveal photoreduction scenarios where the TNC center is reduced directly without first passing through the T1 center. We further illustrate the efficiency and robustness of these hybrid systems through continuous irradiation experiments and laser flash photolysis, shedding light on mechanistic pathways and potential applications in sustainable photocatalysis.

         <title>Chiral Porous Organic Polymers (CPOPs): Design, Synthesis, and Applications in Asymmetric Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterogeneous chiral porous organic polymers (CPOPs) are novel emergent catalytic materials with robust chemical stability. CPOPs with tailor&#8208;made properties can be readily synthesized from simple programmed organic building blocks. This comprehensive review summarizes the design, synthesis, and applications of CPOPs for diverse enantioselective transformations. The fact that the CPOPs expand the repertoire of catalytic chiral porous materials in the arsenal of organic chemists for asymmetric synthesis is compellingly borne out.








Abstract
Since the recognition of the area of asymmetric synthesis in 2000, there has been a tremendous focus on the development of heterogeneous catalysts for asymmetric synthesis. Porous organic polymers (POPs) have emerged in recent years as inextricable materials of high physicochemical and hydrolytic stabilities, permitting infinite possibilities to modulate and tune reactivity, engineer porosity, regulate spatial environments and pore attributes, and maneuver material transport. With a diligent design of building blocks and the exploitation of organic reactions judiciously, the synthesis of POPs with BET surface areas of the order of a few thousand cm3/g has been demonstrated. The incorporation of reactive functional groups and chiral centers into the porous matrices of polymers offers opportunities to conduct asymmetric synthesis. Very high enantioselectivities of the order of 99% ee have been exemplified in the reactions mediated by chiral POPs (CPOPs). The design&#8208;driven tunability of POPs allows the development of catalytic materials for targeted applications in a tailor&#8208;made fashion. This review, while placing the development of chiral materials for asymmetric synthesis in the right perspective, delves into different design principles to pave the way for continued research on futuristic CPOP materials by a creative design, limited by one's imagination, for heretofore unprecedented results.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Prodrug Linkers that Simultaneously Release Cargo and Neutralize in situ Generated (Aza)Quinone Methides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;immolative linkers that use p&#8208;amino/hydroxy&#8208;benzyloxycarbonyl (PABC/PHBC) spacers are essential to the mechanism of many prodrugs. However, a highly reactive (aza)quinone methide is generated as a potential toxic byproduct. To remove the methide as it forms, we synthesized a series of novel tripartite prodrugs, comprising different triggers (nitro, amide, azide, boronate) and a PABC/PHBC&#8208;type self&#8208;immolative spacer with an integrated nucleophile (amine). Upon reductive, hydrolytic or oxidative trigger activation, the release of the cargo is facilitated via a 1,6&#8208;elimination that generates a reactive (aza)quinone methide. With the built&#8208;in nucleophile, the (aza)quinone methide is rapidly self&#8208;quenched to generate tetrahydroisoquinolines (THIQs). One of the selected THIQs does not exhibit an anti&#8208;proliferative effect on the A431 mammalian tumor cell line. The new prodrug strategy has broad scope, enabling the use of a trigger that matches the targeted stimulus, while allowing for a diverse range of drug/cargo attachment. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study adds a new linker strategy that quenches the electrophilic (aza)quinone methide generated in many self&#8208;immolative linker systems and could find applications in prodrug and antibody&#8208;drug conjugate strategies, or as a linker for probes in chemical biology.</dc:description>

         <title>Endohedral Coordination of Bulky Substrates in Metalloenzyme&#8208;like Organometallic Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial receptors inspired by metalloenzymes share three key properties: a structurally flexible cavity, substrate binding via metal&#8211;ligand coordination, and metal&#8208;based redox activity. Herein, we report an organometallic nanotube with such features based on our supramolecular pillarplex platform, with eight CuI centers integrated in its cavitand walls. The structurally adaptable cavity of this receptor enables the endohedral coordination of tetrahydrofuran (THF) as a hydrophilic model substrate with remarkable binding affinity despite a steric mismatch between the host and guest. Evidence from SC&#8208;XRD, 1H NMR titration in aqueous solution, and DFT modelling confirms that metal&#8211;ligand coordination governs substrate binding. Electrochemical analysis of a derived rotaxane reveals metal&#8208;centered redox activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Long&#8208;Lived Excimer&#8208;Like Emission from a &#960;&#8208;Stacked Trichromophore Comprising Perylene Monoimide and Perylene Diimide Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A trichromophore has been synthesized comprising a perylene diimide sandwiched between two perylene monoimide diester (PMIDE) units and held in place by xanthene spacers. The DFT computed structure indicates &#960;&#8208;stacking of the three polycycles, with a mean interplanar separation of 4.2&#258;, but with the central unit displaced sideways. Phenyl groups inserted between xanthene and perylene help to rigidify the structure. Electronic interactions between perylene polycycles splits the absorption spectrum, which is dominated by transitions to the upper&#8208;lying H&#8208;state. Excimer&#8208;like emission is observed in solution at room temperature, for which the lifetime is ca. 22 ns in toluene and ca. 8 ns in CH2Cl2. Transient absorption spectroscopy indicates instantaneous formation of a Franck&#8208;Condon state, which undergoes rapid vibrational cooling to populate the low&#8208;lying J&#8208;state. This species transforms over 40&#8208;60 ps into an excimer&#8208;like state wherein the exciton is delocalised over all three perylenes. A slower structural re&#8208;arrangement, complete within 1 ns, minimises electronic interactions with one of the PMIDE units and stabilises the resultant bipartite excimer&#8208;like state.</dc:description>

         <title>Parent, Unsubstituted Corrphycene: Synthesis and Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis of a porphyrin isomer that, until now, has only been obtained in the form of multiply substituted derivatives. Structural, spectral, and electrochemical characteristics of unsubstituted corrphycene (Cp) are described along with the data for its precursor, 11,18&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcorrphycene. Similar to porphine, Cp turns out to be a soft chromophore, characterized by very similar energy splittings between the pairs of frontier HOMO and LUMO orbitals. Magnetic circular dichroism spectra indicate that the splitting in the HOMO orbitals is larger than in the LUMO, opposite to the DFT predictions. Corrphycene exists in the form of a doubly degenerated trans tautomeric species. The two intramolecular H&#8208;bonds are not equivalent, which strongly suggests a stepwise mechanism of trans&#8208;trans conversion. Being a nearly perfect soft chromophore, Cp emerges as an attractive candidate for sensing changes in its environment.</dc:description>

         <title>Extrudable Thermosets Based on Dynamic Covalent Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic covalent polymers (DCPs) have attracted considerable attention for fabricating self&#8208;healing, recyclable, adaptive, and malleable thermosets. However, their processing has largely depended on compression moulding, which requires extended time due to the crosslinked nature of these materials. This limitation poses significant challenges for applications in continuous processes like extrusion, a technique highly valued in industry for producing long, uninterrupted products. Recently, continuous processing methods for DCPs have emerged, offering potential to streamline their production by providing scalability and consistency&#8208;factors that could transform sectors such as automotive, aerospace, and consumer goods. Yet, developing extrudable DCPs remains a complex task, demanding the precise design of dynamic crosslinks with rapid kinetics, high thermal stability, and cost&#8208;effectiveness, all while ensuring compatibility with suitable molecular backbones. In this review, we summarize the key requirements for designing extrudable DCPs and discuss recent advancements in continuous processing techniques aligned with various design strategies. We also highlight the challenges and outline future directions for optimizing high&#8208;performance DCP extrusion, aiming to offer a valuable resource for researchers and industry professionals looking to leverage these techniques.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning of Thermal Back Reactivity of Aza&#8208;Diarylethene Photoswitches by Introducing Benzazole Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular photoswitches have attracted significant attention due to their potential applications in materials science and life science. In this study, we synthesize a series of aza&#8208;diarylethenes incorporating benzazole groups as the nitrogen atom source for 6&#960; azaelectrocyclization and investigate their photochromic behaviors. Compounds 1&#8211;3, bearing benzothiazole, benzoxazole, and benzimidazole groups, exhibit thermally reversible type photochromism with thermal back reaction half&#8208;lives (t1/2) ranging from milliseconds to seconds at 293 K. Additional derivatives 4&#8211;6 with benzothiophene&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide at the ethene bridge moiety, further expand the range of thermal back reactivity, with t1/2 values extending up to tens of minutes. Quantum chemical calculations confirm that the variation in thermal back reactivity is governed by the energy difference between open&#8208; and closed&#8208;ring isomers, in accordance with the Bell&#8722;Evans&#8722;Polanyi principle. These findings provide a molecular design strategy for controlling the thermal back reactivity of aza&#8208;diarylethenes, enabling further development of functional photochromic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of [3]Rotaxanes with Two Oligo(para&#8208;phenylene) Axles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[3]&#8208; and [2]rotaxanes with oligo(para&#8208;phenylene) axles were synthesized by Ni&#8208;mediated biaryl coupling. [3]Rotaxanes were synthesized in good yields when a larger macrocyclic Ni complex was employed. The spectroscopic properties and the aggregation behavior of octa(para&#8208;phenylene) derivatives were examined. The aggregated/non&#8208;aggregated state could be controlled by utilizing the interlocked structure.







Abstract
Oligo(para&#8208;phenylene) (PPn) is a &#960;&#8208;conjugated compound where phenylene units are directly connected at the 1,4&#8208;positions. Utilizing the catalytic activity of the macrocyclic dihydrodibenzophenanthroline&#8208;Ni complex, we succeeded in the synthesis of [3]&#8208; and [2]rotaxanes with PPn axles by biaryl coupling. The size of the macrocycle was critical to synthesize [3]rotaxanes, which consist of two oligo(para&#8208;phenylene) axles, in good yields. The relationship between the length of the PPn structure on the 1H NMR spectra of the rotaxanes was studied. The aggregation of a PP8 derivative was suppressed by the presence of the macrocycle in the rotaxanes. A [3]rotaxane could be considered as a model compound of an aggregated PPn, and the photophysical studies disclosed the influence of the aggregation on the properties of PPn.

&lt;p&gt;[3]- and [2]rotaxanes with oligo(&lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-phenylene) axles were synthesized by Ni-mediated biaryl coupling. [3]Rotaxanes were synthesized in good yields when a larger macrocyclic Ni complex was employed. The spectroscopic properties and the aggregation behavior of octa(&lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-phenylene) derivatives were examined. The aggregated/non-aggregated state could be controlled by utilizing the interlocked structure.

         <title>A New Generation of Sumanene&#8208;Based AIEgens for the Effective Recognition of Metal Cations in Solutions Containing 95&#8197;vol&#8201;% of Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) active sumanene&#8208;based receptors were synthesized and successfully applied to the effective recognition of cesium or lithium cations in solutions containing 95&#8197;vol&#8201;% of water.







Abstract
In recent years, the application of sumanene derivatives for the optical detection of metal cations was demonstrated. Unfortunately, known sumanene&#8208;based receptors enable the detection process in purely organic solutions or in aqueous media containing not lower than 50&#8197;vol&#8201;% of organic solvent. Designing easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize sumanene&#8208;based optical receptors able to effectively recognize metal cations in aqueous solutions containing a slight volume fraction of organic solvent remained an important and vital challenge. In this work, we show that water&#8208;insoluble sumanene receptors composed of only carbon and hydrogen atoms enable the effective detection of cesium (Cs+) or lithium (Li+) cations in solutions containing 95&#8197;vol&#8201;% of water. Their key feature is related to the exhibition of an aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) effect. We discovered that the designed sumanene receptors exhibit excellent detection parameters expressed by Stern&#8208;Volmer constant values at the level from 108 to 1010&#8197;M&#8722;1. This work also shows that by simple modification of the sumanene receptor structure, it is possible to drastically change its detection preference from large Cs+ cations to small Li+ cations. The highest sensitivity of the designed receptors was concluded for Na+ or Li+, depending on the receptor structure. This work opens new avenues in designing sumanene&#8208;based optical receptors.

         <title>Biomimetic Growth of Calcium Oxalate Hydrates: Shape Development and Structures in Agar Gel Matrices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biomimetic growth of calcium oxalate hydrates is conducted using a double diffusion technique in agar gel. The results reveal the shape development of calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) and dihydrate (COD), resembling biominerals of kidney stones. The pH variations influence phase selection, with COM forming at lower pH and COD at higher pH. The findings offer insights into pathological biomineralization and urolithiasis.







Abstract
Crystal growth of calcium oxalate hydrates (COM: calcium oxalate monohydrate; COD: &#8208;dihydrate; COT: &#8208;trihydrate) is a specific example of pathological biomineralization due to their harmful role as kidney/urinary stones. In this work, the biomimetic growth of calcium oxalate hydrates has been achieved using double diffusion technique in agar gel matrix. In&#8197;vitro experimental models for the growth of calcium oxalates can give valuable information on the formation of biominerals of kidney/urinary stones. Diverse morphological forms of COM are grown in agar gel matrices ranging from platy crystallites to dumbbells and spherulites. The morphology of COM grown in agar gel resembles COM biominerals remarkably. Furthermore, it has been discovered that a higher pH of the agar gel promotes COD development while suppressing COM growth.

         <title>Abundant Transition Metal Based Photocatalysts for Red Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We discussed here the recent developments on the abundant transition metal based photocatalysts and their applications in red light&#8208;driven photocatalysis.








Abstract
Photocatalysis emerges as an efficient and versatile tool for the preparation of organic compounds via the development of new methodologies and new photosensitizers. Mostly UV and blue light irradiation are used for such reactions. Red light is low&#8208;energy light, it is less harmful and has more penetration depth. Hence red light&#8208;driven photocatalysis would be more suitable for preparing value&#8208;added products. Red&#8208;absorbing photosensitizers are mostly based on rare and expensive metals. In this review, we describe the recent developments on Earth&#8208;abundant transition metal&#8208;based photosensitizers (W(0), Mo(0), Cr(0), Fe(III), Cu(I), Zn(II)) and their applications in red light&#8208;driven photocatalysis. Photocatalysis using both electron transfer and energy transfer processes is discussed. Three different red light&#8208;induced reactions such as direct monophotonic excitation, sensitized triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (sTTA&#8208;UC), and dual red light photocatalysis are presented. Various organic transformations such as reductive dehalogenation and detosylation, reduction of diazonium salts, C&#9472;C coupling via C&#9472;H activation, oxidation of aryl boronic acids to phenols, polymerization reactions, cross dehydrogenative couplings, &#945;&#8208;cyanation of tertiary amines, Barton decarboxylation have been carried out using abundant photosensitizers and red light.

         <title>Tuning Surfactant Chain Length in a Metallomicellar Catalyst System to Study Organic Transformations in Water Medium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrated the influence of alkyl chain length, crafted in Mo&#8208;based catalysts, on the reaction rates of oxidative coupling of 1,2&#8208;diaminobenzene with benzyl alcohol in water where the catalytic efficiency increased with chain length. Using the best catalyst Mo&#8208;16, a variety of benzimidazole derivatives were synthesized in water under open air without the addition of any external base/additive.








Abstract
The hydrophobicity of alkyl chain plays crucial role in the aggregation behavior of metallomicelle&#8208;forming coordination complexes, in water, thereby influences the reaction rates of metallomicelle catalyzed organic reactions. Here, we have demonstrated the chain length variation for alkyl group that is covalently attached to ligand backbone of a MoO2(Ln)(OH2) type complex showing metallomicelle formation in water when the alkyl group is eight&#8208;carbon chain or beyond. The impact of alkyl chain length on reactivity of organic transformation was systematically studied for oxidative coupling of benzylic alcohol with 1,2&#8208;diaminobenzene forming benzimidazole, in water, as a model reaction. The efficiency of Mo&#8208;complexes increases with chain length for the mentioned organic reaction performed in water medium under open air as sole oxidant without the involvement of base/additive, thus making the protocol attractive. This work develops a unique study to understand organic reactions in micellar medium as well as an efficient pathway for the direct synthesis of benzimidazoles from alcohols and diamines.

Abstract
To meet the challenges of the energy sector adaptation of novel electrode materials is urgently needed. Pseudocapacitors are electrochemical energy storage devices and are utilized to fulfill the growing demand of society. Hence, strong efforts are made towards the development of electrodes based on renewable organic molecular architectures. In this connection, donor&#8211;acceptor commands are attractive alternatives to inorganic materials due to their optoelectronic properties. Herein, a triphenylamine&#8211;anthraquinone&#8208;based donor&#8211;acceptor chromophore was developed in electrode materials. As prepared electrode materials based on TPA&#8208;IM&#8208;AQ on graphite foil (GF) are employed to fabricate a three&#8208;electrode supercapacitor (SC) device in 1&#160;M H2SO4 electrolyte. At 0.5 A g&#8722;1 current density TPA&#8208;IM&#8208;AQ electrodes&#8208;based SC can deliver higher specific capacitance (Csp) of 275.72 F g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1 current density and at 5&#160;mV s&#8722;1 scan rate with Csp of 233.63 F g&#8722;1. Moreover, a two&#8208;electrode symmetric supercapacitor (SSC) exhibited Csp of 91.63 F g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1 with energy density as high as 16.49&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 1079.96&#160;W kg&#8722;1. The TPA&#8208;IM&#8208;AQ/GF&#8208;based device exhibits good Csp retention with 88.40% after 5000 cycles at 3 A g&#8722;1. As&#8208;fabricated TPA&#8208;Im&#8208;AQ/GF electrode demonstrated the advantages of utilizing small organic molecules to achieve a wider operational potential window and higher Csp.

&lt;p&gt;This investigation presents the triphenylamine-anthraquinone (TPA-Im-AQ) based donor-acceptor based organic electrode materials featuring charge-storage ability. As-fabricated electrode TPA-Im-AQ/GF achieved wider potential voltage window, which in turn resulting in higher specific capacitance and long-term cycling stability. The excellent electrochemical properties of TPA-IM-AQ make it a promising organic electrode material for pseudocapacitors

         <title>Binuclear lanthanide complexes as magnetic resonance and optical imaging probes for redox sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a family of lanthanide(III) complexes that act as redox probes via both magnetic resonance and luminescence outputs. The ligands are functionalized with nitro, azobenzene and azide groups which are reduced to a common aniline product, and each responds to both chemical and biocatalytic reductive conditions at different cathodic onset potentials. By judicious choice of complexed Ln(III), the probes can be optimized either for use in magnetic resonance imaging (Ln = Gd), or as highly efficient turn&#8208;on luminescence probes (Ln = Tb). The Tb(III) analogues are essentially non&#8208;emissive, until reductive generation of the aniline affords a complex which when excited by visible light (488 nm) emits green light with a quantum yield of 45% and millisecond long luminescent lifetimes (ms). The tunable redox response and imaging modalities of these versatile complexes have the potential to open up new approaches to imaging hypoxia.</dc:description>

         <title>Conception and synthesis of sequence&#8208;coded morpholinos</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;phase morpholino chemistry was explored as a new route to synthesize abiological sequence&#8208;defined oligomers. Two comonomers 0 and 1 containing (i) a chlorophosphoramidate reactive function, (ii) a trityl&#8208;protected morpholine and (iii) a coding substituent (H or CH3 for 0 and 1, respectively) on the morpholine ring were first synthesized and characterized. This binary alphabet was afterwards tested for the synthesis of digitally&#8208;encoded oligomers with different length and sequences. The oligomers were prepared on a modified polystyrene resin, cleaved and characterized by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. When using a repetitive cycle containing only morpholino coupling and trityl deprotection steps, the formed oligomers were not uniform. Thus, an additional capping step was added. In these conditions, uniform coded sequences were prepared in most cases. Furthermore, the oligomers were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry. In the studied collision&#8208;induced dissociation conditions, the repeat units of the oligomers undergo two main&#8208;chain fragmentations and full sequence coverage was observed for all studied sequences. Therefore, the binary messages stored in the oligomers could be decoded and retrieved in all cases.</dc:description>

         <title>Core&#8208;Twisted, Cationic Perylene Diimides; Homochiral Dimerisation and Chiroptical Anion Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Core&#8208;twisted perylene diimides are chiral organic dyes that may be exploited for self&#8208;assembled chiroptical materials or for the enantioselective recognition and sensing of chiral substrates. Discrete self&#8208;assembled dimers and host&#8211;guest complexes of core&#8208;twisted perylene diimides are important for furthering our understanding of this supramolecular chemistry, yet they are rare because the twisted perylene core significantly weakens intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions with the PDI&#8217;s &#960;&#8208;surface. To address this challenge, we have installed hydrogen bond donor groups in the PDI&#8217;s bay positions, which directs the formation of a robust, co&#8208;facial and homochiral intermolecular PDI dimer. The structure of this discrete dimer is distinct to previous aggregates of non&#8208;planar PDIs that utilise the imide position for hydrogen bonding. We also uncover the potential of core&#8208;twisted, dicationic PDIs for the enantioselective recognition and chiroptical sensing of chiral anions and investigate the basis of this response via chiral complementarity in the discrete host&#8211;guest complex.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Structurally&#8208;modified aminoglycosides, such as kanamycin, have shown promise as antibiotics and premature termination codon read&#8208;through drugs to fight against drug&#8208;resistant bacteria and to treat genetic diseases, respectively. Therefore, research on developing and discovering aminoglycoside antibiotics has recently increased. However, synthetic strategies for controllably positioning the two 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;glycoside moieties on the symmetrical structure of kanamycin have not yet been established. Herein, we report on a novel route for the total synthesis of kanamycins A and B via regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selective introduction of 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;glycosidic linkages as the key step. We successfully synthesized &#945;(1,6)&#8208;linked glycoside using a 1,2&#8208;anhydro donor and 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;myo&#8208;inositol 1,3,5&#8208;orthoformate acceptor in the presence of a boronic acid catalyst via desymmetric boron&#8208;mediated aglycon delivery.

         <title>Supergelation via Weak Interactions: An Efficient Method for the Fabrication of Hydrophobic Circularly Polarized Luminescent Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral hydrophobic supergelators were developed using a host&#8211;guest approach. Incorporation of non&#8208;polar chromophores into a chiral gel led to the fabrication of composite materials exhibiting circularly polarized luminescence with tunable properties. The sign of chiral emission was governed by the optical activity of the gel, whereas the wavelength of chiral luminescence was controlled by the fluorophore emission.








Abstract
The hydroxylated derivative of stearic acid, 12&#8208;hydroxy stearic acid (12&#8208;HSA), is derived from castor oil and possesses a unique chemical structure that renders it noteworthy in the field of cosmetics and medicine. Being derived from renewable sources, it aligns with the growing demand for sustainable and eco&#8208;friendly material. While the gelation properties of 12&#8208;HSA are known, its chiroptical properties remain unexplored. Herein, a host&#8211;guest approach is adopted for the induction of optical activity in achiral chromophores using 12&#8208;HSA as a chiral template. The induction of optical activity from the host gelator to the guest chromophores resulted in the generation of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) from hybrid nanocomposites. This strategy was effective in generation of chiral luminescence in non&#8208;polar chromophores, a class of molecules unexplored in CPL. The use of red&#8208; and blue&#8208;emitting chromophores led to the fabrication of chiral light&#8208;emitting materials in the respective spectral range. The structural attributes of the gelator imparted hydrophobic character to the co&#8208;assembled nanostructures. The robustness of the nanocomposites helped derive self&#8208;standing chiral luminescent soft materials of desired sizes and shapes. The readily available raw materials and ease of operation make this an effective approach for the fabrication of CPL active materials for diverse applications.

The induction of optical activity from the host gelator to the guest chromophores resulted in the generation of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) from hybrid nanocomposites. This strategy was effective in generation of chiral luminescence in non-polar chromophores, a class of molecules unexplored in CPL. The use of red- and blue-emitting chromophores led to the fabrication of chiral light-emitting materials in the respective spectral range. The structural attributes of the gelator imparted hydrophobic character to the co-assembled nanostructures. The robustness of the nanocomposites helped derive self-standing chiral luminescent soft materials of desired sizes and shapes. The readily available raw materials and ease of operation make this an effective approach for the fabrication of CPL active materials for diverse applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Red Emissive 1D Copper(I) Thiolates and Green Emissive 2D Copper(I) Halide Thiolates Displaying Second Harmonic Generation and Two&#8208;Photon Absorption Processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two series of new copper thiolate and copper halide thiolate coordination polymers are presented, the first one is made of 1D chains with classical red emission, while the second one is built of 2D layer exhibiting bright green emission due to a two&#8208;photon absorption process and is coupled with a secondharmonic generation response.








Abstract
Copper(I), as a d10 metal, is a promising affordable noncritical raw material finding great interest for the development of photoluminescent materials. Halide and thiolate&#8208;based copper(I) compounds are known for their efficient emission and good stability. In order to rationalize the effect of these two anions in the structure and photoemission of Cu(I) compounds, two new families of coordination polymers have been synthesized: the copper(I)&#8208;thiolates: [Cu(p&#8208;SPhX)]n (X&#160;=&#160;F, Cl, Br), and the copper halide thiolates: [Cu3Cl(p&#8208;SPhX)2]n (X&#160;=&#160;F, Cl, Br). The two families display different structural dimensionalities: 1D [Cu(p&#8208;SPhX)]n versus 2D [Cu3Cl(p&#8208;SPhX)2]n and they exhibit distinct photophysical properties: [Cu(p&#8208;SPhX)]n shows usual solid&#8208;state red emission, while [Cu3Cl(p&#8208;SPhX)2]n hasintense solid&#8208;state green anti&#8208;Stokes emission, associated, for the noncentrosymmetric compounds, X&#160;=&#160;F and Br, to non&#8208;linear optical (NLO) response, pointing out the effect of the weak halogen interactions of the thiolate ligands on the symmetry and the properties.

         <title>Carbon Framework Endows High&#8208;Stability Molybdenum Sulfide Nanosheet Anode for High&#8208;Voltage and Fast&#8208;Charging Alkali&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aligned ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets anchored on a carbon framework (i.e., CF@MoS2) through a C&#9472;S bond via a sacrificial template strategy using Te nanowires are developed for both LIBs and SIBs. The C&#9472;S interfacial bonding ensures robust structural integration, while expanded interlayer spacing and bimodal pore channels synergistically enhance ion/electron transport. As a result, the optimized CF@MoS2 exhibits excellent rate capability and record&#8208;breaking cycling stability in both half&#8208;cell and full&#8208;cell.








Abstract
Molybdenum disulfide (i.e., MoS2), while promising as an anode for alkali&#8208;ion batteries, faces critical challenges including structural degradation and sluggish ion diffusion kinetics in practical applications. Herein, MoS2 nanosheets anchored on a carbon framework (i.e., CF@MoS2) through C&#9472;S bonds were successfully synthesized, in which the three&#8208;dimensional carbon framework was synthesized using tellurium nanowires as the template. The C&#9472;S interfacial bonding ensures robust structural integration, while expanded interlayer spacing and bimodal pore channels synergistically enhance ion/electron transport. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared CF@MoS2 demonstrates unprecedented performance in both lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). A high lithium storage capacity of 1072 mAh g&#8722;1 with superior stability over 500 cycles at 1.0 A g&#8722;1 can be achieved, while a high&#8208;rate capacity of 570 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5.0 A g&#8722;1 and excellent cycling stability over 500 cycles are also demonstrated in SIBs. The great features of CF@MoS2 are further confirmed versus LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 cathode in a high&#8208;voltage and fast&#8208;charging lithium&#8208;ion full battery, where the excellent stability and long lifespan are both confirmed. This work probes a great potential for developing metal sulfide&#8208;based electrodes in next&#8208;generation fast&#8208;charging energy storage systems.

         <title>MXene Loaded With Cu(2&#8208;x)Se Nanozyme for Nanocatalytic Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study innovatively combines etched/stripped monolayer Ti3C2 MXene with Cu(2&#8208;x)Se nanoparticles in a one&#8208;pot method. The synthesized Ti3C2/Cu(2&#8208;x)Se nanocomposite has catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD) &#8208;like activities combined with the excellent photothermal properties of MXene, which enhances the catalytic performance of Cu(2&#8208;x)Se under near infrared (NIR) irradiation, and realizes the synergic photothermal catalytic treatment.








Abstract
Traditional tumor treatments (surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, etc.) have certain limitations and can have serious negative effects, such as difficulty in cutting out tumors, damage to normal tissues, and complications. Ordinary nanozymes have low catalytic activity and require higher doses for treatment, which can increase in vivo toxicity and side effects. To address these limitations, we developed a Ti3C2 MXene&#8208;based nanocomposite (Ti3C2/Cu(2&#8208;x)Se) integrating Cu(2&#8208;x)Se nanozymes with dual enzyme&#8208;mimicking activities (catalase and peroxidase) and MXene's photothermal properties. The Cu(2&#8208;x)Se component catalyzes the decomposition of tumor&#8208;overexpressed H2O2 into O2 and cytotoxic &#183;OH, alleviating hypoxia while inducing oxidative stress. Simultaneously, MXene's high surface area and photothermal capability enhance nanozyme stability, biocompatibility, and catalytic efficiency under near&#8208;infrared irradiation. Notably, the photothermal effect amplifies enzymatic activity, enabling synergistic nanocatalytic&#8208;photothermal therapy. This synergy not only degrades glutathione to suppress tumor antioxidant defenses but also achieves targeted tumor ablation with reduced dosage requirements. Our work highlights a rational design of MXene&#8208;based nanozymes for enhanced multimodal tumor therapy, offering a paradigm for nanocomposite&#8208;driven disease treatment.

         <title>Low&#8208;Power Piezoelectric Energy From Chiral Supramolecular Polymer of a Donor&#8211;Acceptor&#8211;Donor Conjugated &#960;&#8208;System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

A donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor (DAD) type conjugated &#960;&#8208;system exhibits spontaneous homochiral supramolecular polymerization in non&#8208;polar solvent and gelation. Solid film generated from preformed aggregate in solution exhibits piezoelectricity and mechanical micro energy harvesting.








Abstract
Soft piezoelectric systems have high demands in flexible, shape conformable and biocompatible low&#8208;power electronics. This paper explores chiral supramolecular polymerization of an ambipolar donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor (DAD)&#8208;type &#960;&#8208;system showing emerging piezoelectric properties for harvesting micro energies. The DAD molecule is designed with two conjugated thiophene donors with a central naphthalene&#8208;diimide (NDI) acceptor chromophore to facilitate intra&#8208;molecular charge&#8208;transfer, evident from a prominent absorption band in the visible region. This chromophore is further appended with two chiral benzamide&#8208;wedges for homochiral supramolecular polymerization. The ambipolar character of the chiral DAD chromophore is manifest from the cyclic voltammogram. Extended H&#8208;bonding among the amide groups leads to homochiral supramolecular polymerization in methyl&#8208;cyclohexane, which is retained in the solid film. The impeccable piezoelectricity in poled DAD film revealed a d33 &#8764; 7 pm/V as measured by the piezoforce microscopy. Poled piezo DAD devices under optimized periodic external impact force, frequencies and supplied electric field generate a viable output voltage and current density of 1.3&#160;V, 0.8&#160;&#181;A/cm2, and Poutput &#8764; 1.6 &#181;W/cm2, respectively. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, stacked and poled supramolecular &#960;&#8208;conjugated DAD devices are shown to viably illuminate a light emitting diode through charging a series of micro capacitors, indicating the potential utility for low power technologies.

     alt="Low-Power Piezoelectric Energy From Chiral Supramolecular Polymer of a Donor&#8211;Acceptor&#8211;Donor Conjugated &#960;-System"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor (DAD) type conjugated &#960;-system exhibits spontaneous homochiral supramolecular polymerization in non-polar solvent and gelation. Solid film generated from preformed aggregate in solution exhibits piezoelectricity and mechanical micro energy harvesting.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soft piezoelectric systems have high demands in flexible, shape conformable and biocompatible low-power electronics. This paper explores chiral supramolecular polymerization of an ambipolar donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor (DAD)-type &#960;-system showing emerging piezoelectric properties for harvesting micro energies. The DAD molecule is designed with two conjugated thiophene donors with a central naphthalene-diimide (NDI) acceptor chromophore to facilitate intra-molecular charge-transfer, evident from a prominent absorption band in the visible region. This chromophore is further appended with two chiral benzamide-wedges for homochiral supramolecular polymerization. The ambipolar character of the chiral DAD chromophore is manifest from the cyclic voltammogram. Extended H-bonding among the amide groups leads to homochiral supramolecular polymerization in methyl-cyclohexane, which is retained in the solid film. The impeccable piezoelectricity in poled DAD film revealed a d&lt;sub&gt;33&lt;/sub&gt; &#8764; 7 pm/V as measured by the piezoforce microscopy. Poled piezo DAD devices under optimized periodic external impact force, frequencies and supplied electric field generate a viable output voltage and current density of 1.3&#160;V, 0.8&#160;&#181;A/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;output&lt;/sub&gt; &#8764; 1.6 &#181;W/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, stacked and poled supramolecular &#960;-conjugated DAD devices are shown to viably illuminate a light emitting diode through charging a series of micro capacitors, indicating the potential utility for low power technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Raman Optical Activity Enhanced via Supramolecular Aggregation and Other Intermolecular Interactions&#8212;A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the recent advancements in the field, emphasizing the significance of Raman optical activity (ROA) spectroscopy as a tool for detecting and analyzing the chirality of supramolecular and other complex systems. We discuss the role of ROA spectroscopy in signal amplification and chirality transfer processes, highlighting its application in systems built of chiral, achiral, or mixed components.








Abstract
In this review, we show that Raman optical activity (ROA) combined with electronic circular dichroism (ECD) are effective tools for detecting supramolecular chirality and related processes such as chiral signal amplification and chirality transfer (also called induction) between chiral and achiral solutes. Research on spontaneous self&#8208;organization has led to significant discoveries in vibrational optical activity (VOA) over the past decade. As a leading topic, we discuss different aggregation pathways of carotenoids, which contributed to the definition of new phenomena in the field of ROA, i.e., aggregation&#8208;induced resonance Raman optical activity (AIRROA), and the first chirality induction observed in nature. We present the chirality of carotenoids as i) amplification via supramolecular assembly, ii) induction by a small number of chiral monomers, and iii) transfer from the local environment. We also report here other complex systems that are relevant to the VOA community in the context of chiroptical analysis. These include ROA signal enhancement, e.g., recorded for amyloid fibrils or achiral linker aggregates attached to silver colloid (plasmonic effects). Finally, we highlight the challenges faced by ROA studies of supramolecular aggregates of strongly absorbing compounds, where chirality transfer may be misinterpreted as artifacts due to the ECD&#8211;Raman effect.

         <title>Interlayer Modification of Crystalline Layered Silicates with Oligodimethylsiloxane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vinyl&#8208;terminated oligodimethylsiloxane chains are grafted on the interlayer surfaces of a crystalline layered silicate. Delaminated nanosheets are used as novel siloxane&#8208;based nanobuilding blocks to produce nanocomposite silicone elastomers.








Abstract
Crystalline layered silicates are valuable precursors for the synthesis of functional siloxane&#8208;based nanomaterials. In this study, vinyl&#8208;terminated oligodimethylsiloxane was grafted onto the interlayer surfaces of a crystalline layered silicate, octosilicate. The oligosiloxane modification facilitated the delamination of the layers in hydrophobic organic solvents. Hydrosilylation reactions between the oligosiloxane&#8208;modified nanosheets and SiH&#8208;terminated polydimethylsiloxane resulted in a clear, stretchable elastomer, demonstrating that the nanosheets acted as cross&#8208;linkers. Furthermore, the introduction of silanolate groups into the elastomer imparted self&#8208;healing properties. These findings expand the potential of crystalline layered silicates as nanobuilding blocks for new materials.

         <title>A Photochromic Dysprosium Compound Supported by &#946;&#8208;Diketone Dithienylethene Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photochromic zero&#8208;filed dysprosium single&#8208;molecule magnet supported by &#946;&#8208;diketone dithienylethene ligand possessing extremely high crystallinity and decomposition temperature was designed and magnetically investigated.








Abstract
Air&#8208;stable lanthanide single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) with photochromic units, e.g. dithienylethene (DTE), anthracene, and polyoxometalates (POMs) have attracted considerable attentions in the field of molecular magnetism as they could increase the range of applications of magnetic molecules. However, the number of photochromic lanthanide SMMs is scarce. Inspired by a boron&#8208;based molecule featuring near&#8208;infrared absorption supported by a DTE&#8208;containing &#946;&#8208;diketonate ligand (3ThacacH) reported by Vivian Wing&#8208;Wah Yam et&#160;al., in this work, we employed this ligand to lanthanide systems for the first time constructing an air&#8208;stable mononuclear Dy(III)&#8208;based compound, Dy(o&#8208;3Thacac)3phen. It is a typical zero&#8208;field SMM with the anisotropy barrier approaching 100 K. Its reversible photochromic behaviors in solution were determined by UV&#8208;Vis absorption and 1H NMR spectra. The inevitable byproducts upon UV irradiation combined with the low yield of photocyclization reaction lead to the incomplete photochromism in a solid state. However, distinct relaxation rates of quantum tunneling of the magnetization between Dy(o&#8208;3Thacac)3phen and the irradiated sample were observed, demonstrating the feasibility of using 3ThacacH to modulate magnetodynamics. Meanwhile, this work highlights the vital roles of avoiding photoinduced byproducts, achieving photochromic single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation, and high yields of photocyclization/photocycloreversion reaction in elucidating the photo&#8208;responsive relaxation mechanism and future device applications.

We report the design, synthesis and studies on two heptazine core&#8208;based C3 symmetric tripodal photoswitchable systems towards photo&#8208;tuned smart molecular materials.








Abstract
Electron&#8208;deficient heptazine&#8208;based molecular and polymeric materials are a fast&#8208;growing area of research with their exciting electronic and optical properties, finding potential applications in catalysis, optoelectronics etc. However, the continuous thirst for the design of heptazine&#8208;core&#8208;based molecular systems has grown in interest in the search for a new class of materials. Herein, we have synthesized two heptazine core&#8208;based C3&#8208;symmetric tripodal molecular systems decorated with three azobenzene and phenylazo&#8208;3,5&#8208;dimethylisoxazole as photoswitchable units connected through &#9472;NH linker. The photoswitching characteristics and thermal half&#8208;lives of photoswitched states were studied using UV&#8211;vis and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. In addition, for azobenzene derivative 1, intriguing properties such as reversible sonication&#8208;induced gelation and base sensing ability have been demonstrated and supported by computations.

         <title>Enhancing Photocatalytic and Antibacterial Properties Through a Synergistic Approach in ZnS&#8211;CuSe Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CZ&#8208;3 nanocomposite is used for methylene blue (MB) dye degradation under visible light. The process involves electron transfer from ZnS to CuSe, generating reactive radicals (&#8226;O2&#8208; and &#8226;OH) that effectively degrade MB and antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus subtilis. CZ&#8208;3 exhibited 98% photocatalytic efficiency and strong antibacterial activity, signifying its potential for environmental remediation and healthcare applications.








Abstract
This study introduces a novel single&#8208;step sonochemical synthesis method for producing pure ZnS and CuSe. It offers a comprehensive report on the fabrication of ZnS&#9472;CuSe nanocomposites with varying compositions (90, 70, and 50% ZnS combined with 10, 30, and 50% CuSe), denoted as CZ&#8208;1, CZ&#8208;2, and CZ&#8208;3, via a wet&#8208;chemical method. Comprehensive characterization was conducted to assess phase purity, structural integrity, composition, detection of free radicals, and optical properties.

&lt;p&gt;CZ-3 nanocomposite is used for methylene blue (MB) dye degradation under visible light. The process involves electron transfer from ZnS to CuSe, generating reactive radicals (&#8226;O&lt;sub&gt;2-&lt;/sub&gt; and &#8226;OH) that effectively degrade MB and antibacterial activity against &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt;. CZ-3 exhibited 98% photocatalytic efficiency and strong antibacterial activity, signifying its potential for environmental remediation and healthcare applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study introduces a novel single-step sonochemical synthesis method for producing pure ZnS and CuSe. It offers a comprehensive report on the fabrication of ZnS&#9472;CuSe nanocomposites with varying compositions (90, 70, and 50% ZnS combined with 10, 30, and 50% CuSe), denoted as CZ-1, CZ-2, and CZ-3, via a wet-chemical method. Comprehensive characterization was conducted to assess phase purity, structural integrity, composition, detection of free radicals, and optical properties. The results revealed that the average crystallite sizes of ZnS and CuSe were 46.91 and 20.31 nm, respectively. Morphological analysis showed CuSe formed nanoflakes, whereas ZnS appeared as nanoparticles. Optical properties revealed a red shift in absorption spectra and a decrease in band gap with increasing CuSe concentration. Electrons in the CBM (conduction band minimum) can be captured by &#8226;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to produce large amounts of &#8226;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;- and &#8226;OH radicals, formed via &#8226;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;- &#8594;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &#8594;&#8226;OH.

         <title>Highly Efficient Solvent&#8208;Free Cyanosilylation of Aldehydes Catalyzed by Bilayered Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two kinds of two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) materials with bilayer structure and different metal active sites were designed and synthesized, and the corresponding nanosheets were prepared to fully expose the catalytic active sites. These two kinds of MOF nanosheets can be used as highly efficient catalysts for the cyanosilylation reaction of aldehydes under solvent&#8208;free and room temperature conditions.








Abstract
While metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising for heterogeneous catalysis and mechanistic investigations due to their well&#8208;defined active sites, high porosity, large surface area, and structural tunability, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MOFs exhibit superior catalytic efficiency over three&#8208;dimensional (3D) MOFs by offering higher specific surface areas and reduced diffusion limitations, thus enhancing active site exposure and substrate accessibility. In this work, two novel bilayered 2D MOFs, Mg3(TPHB)2(H2O)6&#183;(DMF)12 (Mg&#8208;TPHB&#8208;MOF) and Mn3(TPHB)2(H2O)6&#183;(DMF)16 (Mn&#8208;TPHB&#8208;MOF), were synthesized, and their efficacy as Lewis acid catalysts in the solvent&#8208;free cyanosilylation of aldehydes was investigated. Both MOFs exhibited remarkable catalytic activity, with Mg&#8208;TPHB&#8208;MOF achieving complete conversion of benzaldehyde within 10 min at room temperature. This catalytic performance surpasses that of many previously reported MOF catalysts for the same reaction, highlighting the potential of 2D MOFs in catalysts. To gain deeper insights into the catalytic mechanism and the superior performance of Mg&#8208;TPHB&#8208;MOF, computational studies were conducted to determine the free energy profiles of the reaction pathways with and without the catalyst. The results of these calculations corroborated the experimental findings, indicating a lower energy barrier for the Mg&#8208;TPHB&#8208;MOF&#8208;catalyzed reaction. Furthermore, both MOFs demonstrated good reusability over five catalytic cycles, maintaining high conversion rates and structural integrity.

         <dc:description>One&#8208; and two&#8208;electron&#8208;oxidized species of two &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems that adopt close &#960;&#8208;stacking structures are referred to as &#960;&#8208;mers and &#960;&#8208;dimers, respectively. These cationic species exhibit intriguing physicochemical properties that are markedly distinct from those of their parent monomeric radical cations. In this study, we have achieved the chemical oxidation of a newly designed tethered dimer comprising two planar sulfur&#8208; and carbon&#8208;bridged triphenylamine (SCBT) units linked by a 1,8&#8208;naphthalene moiety to obtain the corresponding &#960;&#8208;mer and &#960;&#8208;dimer as crystalline materials. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses revealed that these cationic species adopt almost perfectly overlapping face&#8208;to&#8208;face close &#960;&#8208;stacking structures. As the degree of oxidation increases from the neutral form to the monocation and the dication, the interatomic S&#8211;S distance decreases drastically from 5.35 to 3.03 &#197;. The injection of electron spins into the neutral species effectively induces covalent&#8208;like bonding interactions between the sulfur atoms and changes the degree of structural freedom of the molecule. The salt of the &#960;&#8208;mer exhibited an electrical conductivity of 1.9 &#215; 10&#8722;6 S cm&#8722;1 at room temperature. The injection of spins by chemical oxidation also dramatically changed the dielectric response by generating dipole moments that affect the symmetry of the molecule.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilizing &#945;&#8208;MnO2 Tunnel Structure via Mo&#8211;Zn Synergistic Doping for Highly Efficient Zn2+ Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To address the rising demand for eco&#8208;friendly and efficient energy storage devices, rechargeable aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) are emerging as a promising candidate for large&#8208;scale energy storage. &#945;&#8208;MnO2 has attracted extensive attention for its open channels and exceptional Zn2+ storage capacity. However, the electrochemical performance of &#945;&#8208;MnO2 is significantly hindered by severe structural collapse and sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, we propose a simple hydrothermal approach for co&#8208;doping Mo and Zn into tunnel&#8208;structured MnO2 (MZMO). The ion diffusion kinetics of MZMO are optimized due to ameliorated electrical conductivity by doped cations and introduced oxygen vacancies within the MnO2 lattice. Moreover, Mo and Zn co&#8208;doping stabilizes the MnO2 framework, significantly enhancing its electrochemical performance during prolonged cycling. Charge storage mechanism analysis further validates the extraordinary stability of the MZMO phase structure during the Zn2+/H+ co&#8208;intercalation and deintercalation. The MZMO cathode demonstrates rapid and reversible Zn2+ storage, with a high capacity of 395 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1, and the capacity remains at 136 mAh g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1. This study demonstrates Mo and Zn co&#8208;doping is an effective strategy to enhance the electrochemical performance of MnO2, offering valuable insights for developing other promising cathodes for AZIBs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, two novel porous LnIII (Ln = DyIII and GdIII) complexes, namely, [Dy5(L)12(&#956;3&#8208;OH)2(H2O)2]Cl&#183;4EtOH&#183;2CH3CN&#183;5H2O (1) and [Gd5(L)12(&#956;3&#8208;OH)2(H2O)2]Cl&#183;5EtOH&#183;5CH3CN&#183;11H2O (2) were methyl&#8208;substituted with 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;naphthaldehyde and 1,1&#8208;di(hydroxymethyl)ethylamine with the participation of Dy(ClO4)3&#183;10H2O and Gd(ClO4)3&#183;10H2O for 1 and 2 at room temperature, respectively. It is shown by X&#8208;ray single crystal diffraction testing that the metal skeletons of complexes 1 and 2 have similar metal skeletons, exhibiting a highly stable co&#8208;vertex double triangular skeleton with the LnIII spin centers form a triangular [Ln3O] cluster via &#181;3&#8208;OH. Magnetic studies demonstrated that complexes 1 displays the slow relaxation property typical of single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs), with an effective energy barrier (Ueff/kB) of 1.61(6) cm&#8722;1 and 4.76 cm&#8722;1 under 0 and 2000 Oe dc field, respectively. Whereas complex 2 exhibits a low&#8208;temperature magnetic refrigeration attribute (maximum &#8208;&#916;Sm = 9.76 J kg&#8208;1 K&#8208;1 for 2, &#916;H = 5 T at 2.0 K) and a highly aggregated form of 2, exhibits an excellent longitudinal relaxation rate (r1) with 2.74 mM&#8208;1s&#8208;1 at 0.5 T and a relatively suitable r2/r1 value (1.12), indicating that it can function as a typical T1&#8208;type magnetic resonance contrast agent.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding the Properties of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Substituted Boron Difluoride 3&#8208;Cyanoformazanate Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>p&#8208;Conjugated materials offer attractive traits including semiconductivity, low&#8208;energy light absorption/photoluminescence, and solution processability that render them ubiquitous within the organic electronics field. Among many strategies for property tuning, the creation of asymmetric electronic structures through the installation of donor and acceptor substituents commonly results in low&#8208;energy absorption/photoluminescence bands. Boron difluoride formazanate dyes are&#160; readily synthesized, can be asymmetrically substituted with donor and acceptor groups, and have unexpectedly low&#8208;energy absorption/photoluminescence bands that extend into the near&#8208;infrared. In this study, we prepared a series of donor&#8208;acceptor substituted boron difluoride 3&#8208;cyanoformazanate dyes and compared their properties to symmetric analogues. Our findings suggest that donor&#8208;acceptor derivatives are highly delocalized with properties intermediate of their symmetric counterparts. Furthermore, the data obtained suggests that the N&#8208;aryl substituents act as donors to the strongly accepting boron difluoride formazanate core, regardless of the functional groups appended to them. These properties were reproduced computationally, and while the frontier orbitals calculated for donor&#8208;acceptor dyes were modestly asymmetric, there was no evidence of charge&#8208;transfer character. This work provides significant insight into the unexpected properties of boron difluoride formazanates and reveals that their strongly accepting nature circumvents the predicted augmentation of electronic structure commonly observed for donor&#8208;accepter substituted dyes.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategies for the Synthesis of Mechanically Planar Chiral Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rotaxanes, belonging to the class of classical mechanically interlocked molecules, exhibit chiral properties that diverge from those of traditional chiral elements, particularly displaying mechanically planar chirality. Their distinctive spatial structure further augments their chiral significance, thereby imparting them with vast potential for applications in the realm of chiral materials and asymmetric catalysis. In recent years, mechanically planar chiral rotaxanes have garnered increasing attention from researchers. In this review, we summarize the recent advancements in obtaining enantiopure mechanically planar chiral rotaxanes. In this regard, chiral separation techniques, the use of chiral auxiliaries, and asymmetric catalytic synthesis have emerged as potent methodologies for constructing chiral rotaxanes, thereby enabling the synthesis of diverse types of mechanically planar chiral rotaxanes. Additionally, we analyze the current challenges faced in this field and look forward to the future development opportunities that lie ahead.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Biopolymer blends (GGs) derived from renewable plant or animal&#8208;based raw materials hold significant potential for competing in the packaging industry by offering environmentally biodegradable and bioresorbable alternatives. One of the main challenges lies in optimizing the mechanical properties to enhance stress transfer between active additives and the gelatin matrices reinforced with modified SiO&#8322; compounds. In this study, a 5&#176;C increase in the glass transition temperature and a fourfold improvement in tensile strength (reaching 12 MPa) were achieved by incorporating hydrophilic SiO&#8322; nano&#8208;clay. Ion distribution maps visualized the interactions between silicon derivatives and polypeptide domains within the gel matrix, revealing increased stability attributed to ions such as Si+, SiO+, SiH+, and SiHO+. The absence of heavy metals in the blends underscores their potential as environmentally friendly and sustainable packaging solutions, with promising applications in sectors such as medical packaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Lipase&#8208;Palladium Co&#8208;Catalyzed Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of Racemic Allylic Esters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhanced dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of racemic allylic esters has been explored using a lipase&#8208;palladium (Pd) co&#8208;catalysis system. By employing a monodentate phosphine ligand, P[C6H3&#8208;2,6&#8208;(OMe)2]3, and sodium acetate (NaOAc), the method achieves faster racemization and higher yields of optically active alcohols (93&#8211;99&#8201;% ee) with minimal side reactions, broadening substrate applicability and reaction efficiency.







Abstract
Dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) by combining lipase&#8208;catalyzed esterification of racemic sec&#8208;alcohols and in&#8197;situ racemization has been widely studied; however, reports on DKR involving lipase&#8208;catalyzed hydrolysis of racemic esters are scarce. This problem is probably due to the lack of more effective and general racemization methods. Herein, we report the enhanced hydrolytic DKR of racemic allylic esters. The discovery of the monodentate ligand P[C6H3&#8208;2,6&#8208;(OMe)2]3, which in&#8197;situ generates Pd complex(es) highly reactive to racemization and the NaOAc&#8208;mediated acceleration of racemization, are notable breakthroughs. Consequently, the DKR of racemic allylic esters can be completed in a few hours at 40&#8201;&#176;C in most cases, yielding optically active allylic alcohols (93&#8201;% ee to &gt;99&#8201;% ee) in 58&#8211;91&#8201;% isolated yields with minimal side reactions.

         <title>Unlocking the Potential of Tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane in Reductive Desulfurization of Thioamides with Silane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective conversion of a functional group to a high&#8208;value product, namely defunctionalization, is an important procedure in synthetic chemistry.&#160; Herein, we report the first transition metal&#8208;free desulfurization of thioamides under relatively mild reaction conditions. The catalytic reaction proceeds with the selective cleavage of the C=S bonds of thioamides to furnish the corresponding amines in good to excellent yields with B(C6F5)3 and PhSiH3. The protocol is simple, does not require any additives, and encompasses a broad substrate scope with chemoselective reduction of vulnerable functional groups. To understand the mechanism, several control studies and detailed computational calculations were performed.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Solid&#8208;State Triplet&#8208;Triplet Annihilation Upconversion Steered by AIE&#8208;Active Isomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A red&#8208;to&#8208;blue solid&#8208;state triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) molecular crystal with a significantly improved upconverted photoluminescence intensity was firstly achieved via a controlled crystallization pathway. Cyano&#8208;substituted stilbene derivatives and transition metal complexes were coupled for TTA&#8208;UC systems. The photophysical properties of the two annihilators and their TTA&#8208;UC systems in solution and aggregate were comprehensively studied. Particularly, UC crystals were simply prepared under different crystallization conditions resulting in different morphological and structural features. It turned out that the UC crystal prepared in the surfactant&#8208;assisted crystallization method demonstrated a 100&#8208;fold higher UC intensity than that in the evaporation crystallization method. The morphological and structural study indicated small nanograins with intact crystalline lattice would facilitate the triplet energy migration leading to a boosted UC efficiency. This work provides a novel perspective for facile construction of high&#8208;efficient solid&#8208;state TTA&#8208;UC by utilizing crystals with appropriate morphology, which significantly promotes the practical applications of TTA&#8208;UC.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Protonation and Iron(II) Complexation on Magnetic Interactions in Spin&#8208;Labeled Mechanically Interlocked Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study reports the effects of protonation and Fe(II) complexation on the exchange coupling and magnetic properties of a [2]&#8208;rotaxane and its corresponding free&#8208;axle biradicals. The rotaxane features nitronyl&#8208;nitroxide units as bulky stopper groups, a triazole&#8208;pyridine&#8208;triazole ligand as the axle component, and a bipyridine moiety within the macrocyclic ring. Our findings, obtained by Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy in solution and magnetometry in solid state, demonstrate that rotaxanation and protonation induce profound changes in the magnetic interactions of the biradical both in its free form and as complexed with Fe(II). These results highlight the transformative impact of the mechanical bond on the electronic structure of interlocked radical systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Singlet, Doublet, and Triplet Emissions of Diarylamine&#8208;Modified Bismuth&#160;Pincer&#160;Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present six bismuth complexes (NCRN)BiX2 (X = Cl, I) with diarylamine&#8208;modified pincer ligands (NCRN = (4&#8208;R&#8208;C6H4)2N&#8208;C6H2&#8208;(CH2NMe2)2&#8208;1,3; R&#160;=&#160;Me, MeO, NMe2) and report on their optoelectronic, photophysical, and electrochemical properties. The complexes exhibit intriguing photophysical behavior, with the p&#8208;tolyl and p&#8209;anisyl derivatives showing phosphorescence at 77 K in frozen solvent matrices and at room temperature (r.t.) in the solid state. In THF solutions at r.t., only ligand&#8208;based fluorescence is observed with strongly reduced quantum yields compared to free proligands NCHRHN. Electrochemical studies reveal up to three reversible one&#8208;electron oxidations. The NMe2&#8208;substituted complexes displays the lowest oxidation potentials and the largest number of redox waves. Radical cations [NCHNMe2N]+ and [(NCNMe2N)BiX2]+ are chemically stable and fluoresce weakly in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) at ca. 1200 nm.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Linkages represent the key feature to affect the properties of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), where chemical perturbation on the linkage microenvironment often leads to a remarkable impact on their applications. Following this strategy, we directly functionalized the imine linkage with a cyano group to form an &#945;&#8208;iminonitrile&#8208;linked COF (CityU&#8208;48) by employing a classic Ehrlich&#8208;Sachs reaction between tris&#8208;(4&#8208;nitrosophenyl) amine (TPA&#8208;3NO) and 1,4&#8208;phenylenediacetonitrile (Ph&#8208;2CN). However, this perturbation makes CityU&#8208;48 susceptible to crystallization due to the steric hindrance and polarity induced by extra cyano groups. By taking advantage of the bipolar redox&#8208;active nature, CityU&#8208;48 delivered a discharge capacity of 139 mAh g&#8208;1 at the current density of 100 mA g&#8208;1 when employed as a cathode in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. These research efforts motivate the design of new linkages to explore their roles in COFs at the atomic level.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Binding Relationship of 2&#8208;Amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;Naphthyridine Dimers: Role of Linkage Positions on DNA and RNA Recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Altering the connecting positions of two 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthyridine units modulates binding to distinct DNA and RNA motifs. This structural variation influences molecular interactions, affecting stacking tendencies and hydrogen bonding. The positional differences determine how these molecules recognize cytosine&#8208;rich sequences, impacting their ability to stabilize nucleic acid structures and paving the way for designing RNA&#8208;targeted small molecules.







Abstract
The study explores the synthesis, structural analysis, and binding properties of eight analogs of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthyridine dimers (ANPxys) targeting DNA and RNA. These dimers, derived from ANP77, are connected at varying positions to investigate how positional alterations influence molecular conformations and their interactions with nucleic acids. The primary focus lies on evaluating the effects of these structural variations on DNA and RNA binding through fluorescence quenching and thermal denaturation assays. Absorption and fluorescence measurements revealed distinct electronic states for ANPxys, with emission maxima between 389.5 and 398.5&#8197;nm. Conformational analysis indicated that most ANPxys adopt unstacked conformations in aqueous solutions, though some, like ANP47 and ANP67, showed higher probabilities of stacked conformations. Thermal denaturation studies demonstrated ANPxys bind and stabilize cytosine&#8208;rich DNA motifs with varying affinities, with ANP77 showing the strongest effects. RNA binding studies targeting U/CC motifs across 256 sequences revealed unique fluorescence quenching patterns for each ANPxy, reflecting sequence specificity. Hierarchical clustering grouped ANPxys into parallel&#8208;stacked and twisted&#8208;stacked clusters, correlating their conformations with binding preferences. This work highlights the critical role of connection positions in determining ANPxy binding specificity and conformational behavior. The findings provide a basis for designing small molecules with tunable structures and enhanced RNA&#8208;binding capabilities, paving the way for the development of RNA&#8208;targeted therapeutics.

Thermal denaturation studies demonstrated ANPxys bind and stabilize cytosine-rich DNA motifs with varying affinities, with ANP77 showing the strongest effects. RNA binding studies targeting U/CC motifs across 256 sequences revealed unique fluorescence quenching patterns for each ANPxy, reflecting sequence specificity. Hierarchical clustering grouped ANPxys into parallel-stacked and twisted-stacked clusters, correlating their conformations with binding preferences. This work highlights the critical role of connection positions in determining ANPxy binding specificity and conformational behavior. The findings provide a basis for designing small molecules with tunable structures and enhanced RNA-binding capabilities, paving the way for the development of RNA-targeted therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Glycan Covalent Targeting Chimera&#8208;Based T Cell Glycoengineering for Boosting Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T&#8208;cell therapy is one of the most effective approaches in cancer immunotherapy. However, shortcomings such as loss of target antigens and poor infiltration remain in the treatment of solid tumors. Herein, we propose an approach to glycoengineer T cells based on glycan covalent targeting chimera (gcTAC), to enhance immunotherapy by modulating the glycan recognition behavior of T cells. We select hydrazide&#8208;modified phenylboronic acid as gcTAC. The hydrazide group can covalently couple with the aldehyde group generated by the oxidation of galactose/N&#8208;acetylgalactosamine on the surface of T cells, while the phenylboronic acid at the other end can specifically bind to sialic acids (Sia) of tumor cells, thereby enhancing the killing effect of T cells. At the same time, T cells covalently bound to tumor cells surfaces act as a blockade of Sia sites, which can disrupt the recognition between Siglec on natural killer (NK) cells and Sia on tumor cells, further enhancing the immune&#8208;killing effect of combined T&#8211;NK cell therapy. Our approach represents a novel concept to promote immune killing through cascading interventions in T&#8211;tumor and tumor&#8211;NK intercellular glycan recognition, thus providing a solution to the problem of immune escape in cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystal Engineering of Cyanoborate&#8208;Bridged Cubane&#8208;Type Tetranuclear Ru Complex: Synthesis, Pseudopolymorphism, and Coordination Polymer Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyanoborate anions are versatile bridging ligands that lead to structurally diverse compounds from a crystal engineering perspective. Here, we present the synthesis of a cubane&#8208;type tetranuclear Ru complex, [Ru4(Cp)4{B(CN)4}4] (1, Cp = C5H5), achieved through the photoirradiation of [Ru(C5H5)(C6H6)]B(CN)4 in solution or the reaction of [CpRu(MeCN)3]+ with KB(CN)4. This complex served as a host for various solvents, generating different pseudopolymorphs, including 1&#183;nCH2Cl2 (n = 1, 2, 3), 1&#183;0.5C6H6, 1&#183;C6H5Me, and 1&#183;3THF upon recrystallization. Moreover, the four free cyano groups in 1 allow it to act as a bridging ligand, facilitating the formation of coordination polymers through reactions with metal complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Fused Nitrogen Bridgehead N,O&#8208;Acetals as Versatile Scaffolds: Synthetic Strategies, Mechanism and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fused Bicyclic N,O&#8208;acetals, are prominently present in several natural products and constitute a versatile family of compounds, with nitrogen&#8208;bridgehead fused N,O&#8208;bicyclic derivatives receiving specific emphasis as pivotal scaffolds due to their significant role in the bioactivity of medicinally relevant molecules. Hence, significant advancements in their applications in Organic Synthesis have been extensively documented in the literature, highlighting their role as key synthetic building blocks/motifs in the construction of complex organic molecules and their utility as chiral auxiliaries in the enantioselective synthesis of natural products and synthetic compound libraries. Nonetheless, while these developments have been well&#8208;explored, our review offers a new perspective by consolidating and critically evaluating various synthetic strategies for accessing the nitrogen&#8208;bridgehead fused N,O&#8208;acetal frameworks (such as hydropyrrolo&#8208;oxazole and oxazine frameworks) providing new insights into their mechanistic approaches and applications, and demonstrating their full potential in advanced synthetic chemistry. These methodologies are systematically covered in terms of their mechanistic pathways, synthetic efficiency, and practical applications, providing an integrated understanding of their contribution to the field of Organic Synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>A Highly Emissive Purely Carbon&#8208;Based System as an Easily Processable and Stable OLED Material</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis of a fluorescent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon dye with a "symmetry&#8208;broken" core, derived from the related hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;benzo&#172;coronene core with a fluoranthene subunit. The fluorophore is composed of a pure carbon skeleton without heteroatoms and exhibits remarkable photo&#172;luminescence properties with a photoluminescence quantum yield of up to 67% in toluene, exceeding that of the parent hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;benzocoronene by a factor of 30. The single crystal X&#8208;ray structure reveals the distorted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon structure, which is responsible for the optoelectronic properties, as supported by density functional theory calculations. We show that the new fluorescent dye can be readily used for the fabrication of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes without extensive optimization, whereby solubility in a variety of solvents and successful film formation are decisive.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploiting a New Strategy to Prepare Water&#8208;Soluble Heteroleptic Iridium(III) Complexes to Control Electrochemiluminescence Reaction Pathways in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct derivatisation of heteroleptic iridium(III) complexes with sulfonate groups removes the limitations of prior strategies for the preparation of water&#8208;soluble analogues, in which complexes were prepared from a narrow range of ligands with suitably polar or charged functional groups. Phenylpyridine, phenylpyrazole and phenylbenzothiazole ligands were selectively sulfonated opposite to their cyclometalated carbon within iridium(III) complexes containing bipyridine or N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ancillary ligands. Altering reaction conditions enabled additional sulfonation of the benzothiazole fragments. Informed by the electrochemical and photophysical properties of the parent complexes in organic solvents, we adopted this strategy to design six novel luminophores that proceed through three different sets of co&#8208;reactant electrochemiluminescence (ECL) reaction pathways under aqueous conditions. The intensity of the indirect co&#8208;reactant ECL of an iridium(III) luminophore was enhanced by over an order of magnitude by introducing a redox mediator, extending this promising analytical approach beyond the conventional [Ru(bpy)3]2+ electrochemiluminophore.</dc:description>

         <title>Allosteric Differentiation of Al(I) Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dimeric potassium alumanyl, [{SiNDipp}AlK]2 ({SiNDipp} =&#160; {CH2SiMe2N(Dipp)}2; Dipp = 2,6&#8208;i&#8208;Pr2C6H3), reacts with two equivalents of PhC&#186;CR (R = Ph or SiMe3) and the exclusive formation of the aluminacyclopropene derivatives, [{SiNDipp}Al{h2&#8208;C2(R1)(R2)}]. In contrast, reactions with&#160; an equal stoichiometry of both alumanyl and alkyne reagents also provide the products of not only alkyne cycloaddition but also para&#8208;C&#8208;H activation of a phenyl substituent. Supported by a theoretical study, this outcome is judged to result from a sequence of cooperative steps and the introduction of a modicum of kinetic discrimination that is suggested to be allosteric in origin.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D&#8208;COFs) have garnered huge attentions as a promising platform for solar to chemical energy conversion. In this work, two novel azadiene&#8208;linked COFs (COF&#8208;JLU236 and COF&#8208;JLU237) were designed and successfully synthesized under solvothermal conditions for the first time. And new materials have high crystallinity, large surface area, good durability and broad absorption range, as well as excellent photoelectric properties. Importantly, they can effectively induce selective oxidation of sulfides and phenylboronic acids under visible light, and show wide substrate adaptability and superior reusability.</dc:description>

         <title>Effects of Chirality and Counter Anions on the Structures and Solid&#8208;state Properties of Radical Cation Salts of Benzo[b]phenoxazine&#8208;based Double Heterohelicene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we prepared stable radical cation salts of racemic and enantiopure double hetero[5]helicene (1), consisting of two benzo[b]phenoxazine (BPO) molecules, using two different counter anions (SbCl6&#8722; and NTf2&#8722;). The effects of chirality and counter anions on the packing structure and solid&#8208;state electronic properties were investigated. X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal analysis revealed that the SbCl6&#8722; anion was positioned above the midpoint of 1&#183;+ in both the racemic and enantiopure crystals of 1&#183;+&#183;SbCl6&#8722;. This alignment resulted from the matching between the curvature of 1&#183;+ and the spherical shape of the SbCl6&#8722; anion, preventing the formation of continuous &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions among 1&#183;+. In contrast, one&#8208;dimensional &#960;&#8211;stacked columns of 1&#183;+ were present in both the racemic and enantiopure 1&#183;+&#183;NTf2&#8722; crystals, as the NTf2&#8722; anions encased the &#960;&#8208;stacked columns of 1&#183;+. All radical cation salts exhibited distinct melting points, and the enantiopure salts of 1&#183;+&#183;NTf2&#8722; had notably low melting points of 393&#8211;395 K, which was 142 K lower than that of rac&#8208;1&#183;+&#183;NTf2&#8722;. ESR and SQUID measurements of the enantiopure 1&#183;+&#183;NTf2&#8722; crystals revealed significant changes in their magnetic properties upon crystal melting. In contrast, rac&#8208;1&#183;+&#183;NTf2&#8722; displayed an unexpected crystal&#8211;crystal phase transition near room temperature, accompanied by a thermal hysteresis loop in its magnetic susceptibility.</dc:description>

         <title>Negative cooperativity in the UHRF1 TTD&#8208;PHD dual domain masks the contributions of cation&#8208;&#960; interactions between trimethyllysine and the TTD aromatic cage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>UHRF1 is a promising epigenetic target in oncology, but inhibitor development has proven challenging due to the interplay between its tandem Tudor domain (TTD) and plant homeodomain (PHD). The TTD binds trimethyllysine (Kme3) at position 9 while the PHD binds Arg at position 2 on histone 3. Herein, we report how the PHD influences TTD recognition of the histone 3 tail containing Kme3 (H3K9me3) versus its neutral isostere, tert&#8208;butyl norleucine (tBuNle). Our findings show that the dual domain binds both peptides equally, supporting tBuNle&#8217;s potential for inhibitor development. However, unexpectedly, the binding mechanism of H3K9me3 differs between the single and dual domains. In the TTD alone, Kme3 is bound in the aromatic cage via electrostatically tunable cation&#8208;&#960; interactions, but in the dual domain, Kme3 binding is independent of electrostatics in the aromatic cage&#8212;an unprecedented observation. Computational studies suggest cation&#8208;&#960; interactions should contribute in both cases. The contrasting experimental and computational results point to an unusual example of negative chelate cooperativity: interactions between the histone and PHD mask the mechanism of TTD recognition of K9me3. This work underscores the complexity of histone PTM readout in multi&#8208;domain proteins and demonstrates the first example of a masked cation&#8208;&#960; interaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Promoted Radical Cascade Bicyclization to Access Partially Saturated Pyrrolo[2,3&#8208;b]pyridines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted cascade [2+2+1] bicyclization reaction of N&#8208;cyanamide alkenes and activated alkyl bromides has been successfully established. This reaction exhibits mild conditions, metal&#8208;free characteristics, and excellent atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economy, along with environmental friendliness. It demonstrates broad substrate tolerance and scalability to gram&#8208;scale synthesis, underscoring its potential for practical applications. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction proceeds through a photoinduced single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) process and a 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process mediated by an iminyl radical.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatial Confinement of Pd Nanoclusters in Pyrene&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Boosting Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic CO2 reduction offers a promising strategy to mitigate the greenhouse effect, yet it remains a challenging process due to the high energy barrier associated with the high stability of CO2. In this study, we synthesized Py&#8208;bTDC, a pyrene&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF) enriched with nitrogen and sulfur atoms, and anchored palladium nanoclusters (Pd NCs) onto its structure to enhance CO2 reduction efficiency. The confined Pd NCs amplify the built&#8208;in electric field (IEF), enabling efficient photogenerated carrier migration and suppressing electron&#8208;hole recombination. Simultaneously, Pd NCs serve as catalytic active sites, optimizing CO2 adsorption and activation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Pd reduces the energy barrier for forming the critical intermediate (*COOH), thereby accelerating CO production. Under visible&#8208;light irradiation in a gas&#8208;solid system using water as a proton donor, the Pd3/Py&#8208;bTDC composite achieved a CO evolution rate of 17.75 &#956;mol&#183;h&#8208;1&#183;g&#8208;1 with 86.0% selectivity. This study advances the design of COF&#8208;based photocatalysts by synergistically modulating IEF and the engineering active sites for efficient CO2 reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence From Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in a Bimetallic Eu&#8211;Al Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Following spontaneous symmetry breaking, a Eu&#8211;Al complex containing only achiral ligands, forms a non&#8208;racemic conglomerate. Both single crystals and the whole crystallized material are circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence active, despite the absence of any chiral inducer.








Abstract
The emergence of optically active functional compounds through spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking is a rare but intriguing phenomenon with relevance of both practical and fundamental interest. Here we show that a racemic Eu&#8211;Al compound, bearing only non&#8208;chiral ligands, forms a conglomerate upon crystallization. Single crystals of the compound are electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) active. Moreover, we found that a significant enantiomeric excess (50%) of either enantiomer is present in each crystallization batch (non&#8208;racemic conglomerate). Such spontaneous symmetry breaking leads not only to optically active single enantiomorph crystals but to an overall solid bulk with significant ECD and CPL.

         <title>Recent Developments in Heterogeneous Catalyzed Epoxidation of Ethylene to Ethylene Oxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Epoxidation of ethylene to produce ethylene oxide (EO) is a vital heterogeneous catalytic chemical process in industry, as EO is an important intermediate for the synthesis of fine chemicals including ethylene glycol, ethoxylates, plastics and polyester. EO is commercially produced by the silver&#8208;catalyzed partial oxidation of ethylene with air or oxygen. However, it remains challenging to understand its chemical behavior under reaction conditions. To overcome this challenge, a series of catalysts with well&#8208;defined structures have been developed. The present review is devoted to summarizing the recent advances in the exploitation of novel catalytic materials for the epoxidation of ethylene, such as metal nanoparticles, clusters, single atoms, and bimetal. The role of promoters in selectivity enhancement will be discussed. A deep understanding of the active species, oxygen species, active structures, activity&#8208;structure relationship, and mechanisms contributing to epoxidation process are highlighted. The integration with other advanced technologies such as electrocatalytic and photocatalytic is also reviewed. Finally, the current challenges and future prospects are provided so as to give guidance for the design of efficient catalysts for heterogeneous epoxidation of ethylene to EO, and to improve the fundamental understanding of the underlying catalytic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperative Photoredox Catalysis Under Confinement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 21, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Concept article provides an overview of advancements in confinement&#8208;aided photoredox catalysis, spanning across well&#8208;established heterogeneous frameworks to emerging homogeneous single&#8208;chain polymers. Focus is placed upon design elements that enable spatial proximity of cocatalysts which, in turn, provides optimal electron, energy, and/or radical transfers. Collectively, the architectures discussed herein underscore the importance of confinement in tackling diffusion limitations in catalysis.







Abstract
Photoredox catalysis has emerged as a potent means to conduct synthetic chemistry. Leveraging light to achieve challenging organic transformations has led to many developments, both of fundamental and industrial nature. Despite their potency, photoredox processes are inherently diffusion controlled, which can limit their ability to enable both reactivity and selectivity. Relevant to this is the idea of colocalizing cocatalysts in architectures that enable spatial proximity, promoting &#8216;catalysis under confinement.&#8217; In this Concept review, we summarize recent designs and advancements using well&#8208;defined heterogeneous and homogeneous frameworks that enable dual photoredox catalysis, such as metal&#8208;organic frameworks, heterogeneous organic polymeric systems, and single&#8208;chain polymer nanoparticles (SCNPs). These advances generally stem from the material's inherent ability to enforce catalyst communication, typically resulting in expedient radical, electron, or energy transfer that accelerates reactivity. Whereas heterogeneous systems are comprehensively investigated, the design space arising from the modularity and versatility of a SCNP is quite large making the recyclable platform an intriguing candidate to investigate for confinement&#8208;enabled photoredox catalysis. We expect that both heterogeneous and homogeneous platforms systems detailed herein will continue to exhibit superior performance, while underscoring the importance of confinement to tackle diffusion&#8208;limited reactions.

         <dc:description>
This study presents the synthesis, structural characterisation, and magnetic properties of hetero&#8208;tetra&#8208;metallic complexes, denoted as FeNOCuLnCo, (with Ln=Gd, Tb, or Dy). These complexes mark a significant milestone as the first examples of polyfunctional compounds containing four different metallic ions, exhibiting dual properties: reversible photo&#8208;isomerism and single&#8208;molecule magnet behaviour.







Abstract
Hetero&#8208;tetra&#8208;metallic complexes, FeNOCuLnCo (Ln=Gd, Tb, Dy), combining magnetic properties and photo&#8208;isomerism, were obtained through the rational assembly of the photo&#8208;switching nitroprusside anion FeNO with new magnetic Schiff base CuLnCo precursors. Herein, we describe the synthesis and characterisation of these compounds followed by a demonstration of their multifunctional character. Particularly noteworthy is the FeNOCuTbCo complex which is one of the few examples of a photo&#8208;isomerisable SMM.

         <title>Near&#8208;Neutral pH Sensing by Azoheteroarene Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 21, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discovered a novel series of azoheteroarene dyes with thiazole, thiadiazole, triazole, pyrazole, or benzothiazole heteroaryls that detect pH changes in near&#8208;neutral aqueous solutions. They exhibit unique light absorption and notable color changes within a narrow pH range, visible to the naked eye.







Abstract
We serendipitously discovered a novel series of azoheteroarene dyes capable of detecting pH variations in near&#8208;neutral solutions. These dyes feature thiazole, thiadiazole, triazole, pyrazole, or benzothiazole heteroaryls linked to hydroxyphenyl azo groups. They exhibit distinctive light absorption properties in aqueous solutions and show notable color changes in a narrow pH range, visible to the naked eye. Both experimental data and quantum calculations suggest a plausible mechanism for their function as pH indicators. Additionally, these azoheteroarene dyes effectively monitor pH in complex environments, and we show their use for detecting the pH change of culture medium containing growing cancer cells.

         <title>Amino&#8208;Substituted Azoxybenzenes as Potential Redox&#8208;Active Catholyte Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 21, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azoxybenzenes (AOB) exhibit unique redox behavior with potential for energy storage systems. In this article, we investigate their electrochemical properties and demonstrate a promising reversible oxidation. However, capacity decay during cycling due to unstable intermediates poses a challenge, necessitating the exploration of stabilization strategies to exploit the full potential of AOBs in energy storage applications.







Abstract
Aryl diazenes, particularly azobenzenes (AB), represent a versatile class of compounds with significant historical and practical relevance, ranging from dyes to molecular machines, solar thermal and electrochemical storage. Their oxygen&#8208;substituted counterparts, azoxybenzenes (AOB), share structural similarities but have been less explored, especially in energy storage applications. This study investigates the redox properties of AOB, comparing them to AB, and evaluates their potential as redox&#8208;active materials for energy storage systems. Through cyclic voltammetry (CV) and spectro&#8208;electrochemical analyses, we demonstrate that AOBs exhibit a distinct redox behaviour, influenced by the solvent and electrolyte environment, with a reversible oxidation process. Despite their promising redox characteristics, AOBs suffer from capacity decay during galvanostatic cycling, likely due to the instability of the radical cation intermediate. These findings suggest that while AOBs offer intriguing redox properties, further investigation into stabilization strategies are needed for their application in energy storage.

&lt;p&gt;Azoxybenzenes (AOB) exhibit unique redox behavior with potential for energy storage systems. In this article, we investigate their electrochemical properties and demonstrate a promising reversible oxidation. However, capacity decay during cycling due to unstable intermediates poses a challenge, necessitating the exploration of stabilization strategies to exploit the full potential of AOBs in energy storage applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aryl diazenes, particularly azobenzenes (AB), represent a versatile class of compounds with significant historical and practical relevance, ranging from dyes to molecular machines, solar thermal and electrochemical storage. Their oxygen-substituted counterparts, azoxybenzenes (AOB), share structural similarities but have been less explored, especially in energy storage applications. This study investigates the redox properties of AOB, comparing them to AB, and evaluates their potential as redox-active materials for energy storage systems. Through cyclic voltammetry (CV) and spectro-electrochemical analyses, we demonstrate that AOBs exhibit a distinct redox behaviour, influenced by the solvent and electrolyte environment, with a reversible oxidation process. Despite their promising redox characteristics, AOBs suffer from capacity decay during galvanostatic cycling, likely due to the instability of the radical cation intermediate. These findings suggest that while AOBs offer intriguing redox properties, further investigation into stabilization strategies are needed for their application in energy storage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Technetium and Rhenium Auto&#8208;reduction, Polymerization and Lability towards Group VII Polyoxometalate Chemistry</title>

Pertechnetate and perrhenate auto&#8208;reduce, leading to coordination geometries suitable for polyoxometalate (POM) assembly. Evaporation of pertechnic acid leads to the prior&#8208;reported [Tc4O4(H2O)2(TcO4)14]4&#8722;. Evaporation of perrhenic acid yields (ReVI,oct)2(ReVII,tet)2(OH)2(O)12&#8901;H2O, the first evidence for Re auto&#8208;reduction, prior known for the lighter group VII congeners. Combined perrhenate and pertechnetate yield the [Tc4O4(H2O)2(ReO4)14]2&#8722; polyanion, the first group VII mixed&#8208;metal POM.







Abstract
Group VII Tc and Re have long been studied to develop both radiopharmaceuticals and technologies for nuclear materials management. Fundamental research has targeted understanding this periodic table crossroads where polyoxometalates meets metal&#8208;metal bonded complexes. Here we have isolated green hygroscopic and metastable crystals of (ReVI,oct)2(ReVII,tet)2(OH)2(O)12&#8901;H2O (ReVI,VII&#8208;green, tet=tetrahedral, oct=octahedral), determined by single&#8208;crystal x&#8208;ray diffraction. In addition to color, Re&#8208;L1 X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge spectroscopy confirms the reduced oxidation state. ReVI,VII&#8208;green provides the first demonstration of Re autoreduction, long&#8208;observed for Mn and Tc. We also isolated and structurally characterized [Tc4O4(H2O)2(ReO4)14]2&#8722; (Tc4Re14) polyanion crystals that contain Tc(V) and Re(VII), consistent with greater stability of reduced Tc compared to reduced Re. Small angle X&#8208;ray scattering of both compounds and prior&#8208;reported polyanion [Tc4O4(H2O)2(TcO4)14]4&#8722; (Tc20) dissolved in acetonitrile indicated a qualitative lability order of oxo&#8208;linkages of Re&#8208;O&#8722;Re &gt; Re&#8208;O&#8722;Tc &gt;Tc&#8208;O&#8722;Tc, and lability of Tc20 was also probed by 99Tc nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Computation provided insight into 99Tc chemical shifts as well as lability. Based on both reducibility and solution phase dynamics of polynuclear compounds investigated here, Re is an imperfect surrogate for Tc, and further expansion of group VII polyoxometalate chemistry seems promising.

         <title>Asymmetric Amination of 1,2&#8208;Diol through Borrowing Hydrogen: Synthesis of Vicinal Amino &#945;&#8208;Tertiary Alcohol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 21, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient, economical and operationally simple approach to chiral vicinal amino &#945;&#8208;tertiary alcohols from readily available tertiary 1,2&#8208;diols was developed through ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed borrowing hydrogen amination pathway. The chiral amino &#945;&#8208;tertiary alcohol prepared through this highly efficient protocol is a fundamental core structure in drug candidates, chiral ligands, and organo&#8208;catalysts.







Abstract
Methods to prepare vicinal amino alcohols are important because of their presence in biologically active compounds. Despite the development of various methods for vicinal amino alcohol synthesis, C(sp3)&#8208;rich oxygen&#8208;containing &#946;&#8208;amine compounds continue to pose great challenge. While ring&#8208;opening reaction of epoxides with amine nucleophile is the prime method for vicinal amino alcohol preparation, epoxides are highly reactive and sometimes difficult to make, resulting in drawbacks regarding selectivity of this approach. Here, we report a catalytic enantio&#8208;convergent amination of &#945;&#8208;tertiary 1,2&#8208;diols for the efficient access to vicinal amino &#945;&#8208;tertiary alcohols. The racemic &#945;&#8208;tertiary 1,2&#8208;diol substrates of different alkyl/aryl or alkyl/alkyl backbone, can be converted to chiral vicinal amino &#945;&#8208;tertiary alcohols through diphenyl phosphate&#8208;mediated RuCl3 catalysed asymmetric borrowing hydrogen (ABH) pathway. This simple ABH reaction can be scaled up to the synthesis of chiral ligands, synthetic intermediates, and other medicinally&#8208;relevant compounds. Overall, this catalytic redox&#8208;neutral procedure broadens the scope of Ru&#8208;catalysed amination of alcohols and discloses an underexplored step&#8208; and atom&#8208;economical synthetic strategy for the synthesis of vicinal amino &#945;&#8208;tertiary alcohols and provides a practicable alternative to the present benchmark procedures.

The exploration of electron&#8208;transfer property of iodonium ylides remains an underdeveloped topic. Here, an electron transfer between malonate&#8208;based iodonium ylide and enol in&#8197;situ generated from 1,3&#8208;diketones induces a cyclization reaction, giving a diverse array of dihydrofurans in moderate yields.







Abstract
While iodonium ylides are important reactants in a wide range of reactions, the exploration of electron&#8208;transfer property of iodonium ylides remains an underdeveloped topic. Herein, we describe a direct cyclization of 1,3&#8208;diketones with malonate&#8208;based iodonium ylides to give a diverse array of dihydrofurans in moderate yields. The control experiments suggest that the electron transfer between enol and iodonium ylide gives reactive species, thus enabling a cyclization cascade process to take place to give dihydrofurans.

A skeletal editing strategy for transforming isoindolines into tetralins involving rearrangement of sulfamoyl azide or triazanium salts.







Abstract
We present a skeletal editing strategy for transforming isoindolines into tetralins via a cascade N&#8208;atom removal deconstruction followed by a Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between in&#8197;situ generated o&#8208;quinodimethanes and activated alkenes. This approach features a broad substrate scope, excellent stereoselectivity, and high yields, demonstrating its applicability to complex bioactive compounds and natural products.

&lt;p&gt;A skeletal editing strategy for transforming isoindolines into tetralins involving rearrangement of sulfamoyl azide or triazanium salts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present a skeletal editing strategy for transforming isoindolines into tetralins &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; a cascade N-atom removal deconstruction followed by a Diels-Alder reaction between &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;situ&lt;/i&gt; generated &lt;i&gt;o-&lt;/i&gt;quinodimethanes and activated alkenes. This approach features a broad substrate scope, excellent stereoselectivity, and high yields, demonstrating its applicability to complex bioactive compounds and natural products. Notably, case studies showcase the efficient construction of challenging spirocyclic and bridged systems, underscoring the method's versatility and potential for advancing applications in synthetic chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Thionated Coumarins: Study of the Intersystem Crossing and the Zero&#8208;field Splitting of the Triplet State Using Time&#8208;Resolved Transient Optical and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Spectroscopies</title>

Thionation Induces Ultrafast ISC but Short Triplet Lifetime: Two thionated coumarin derivatives were prepared and the photophysical properties were studied. Fluorescence quenching and ultrafast intersystem crossing were observed, but the triplet state lifetimes become shorter upon thionation. Large zero field splitting D value of the triplet state indicates strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling effect of the thionated carbonyls.







Abstract
To study the effect of thionation of the carbonyl groups in a chromophore, i.&#8201;e. replacing the O atom with S atom, on the photophysics, we studied two thionated coumarin derivatives (Cou&#8208;S and Cou&#8208;6&#8208;S) with various steady state and transient spectroscopic methods. Both compounds exhibit red&#8208;shifted absorption (up to 4900&#8197;cm&#8722;1) and strong fluorescence quenching as compared to the unthionated analogues. Femtosecond transient absorption spectra show fast ISC (ca. 10&#8197;ps) in the thionated coumarin derivatives, while negligible ISC was observed in the unthionated coumarin. Interestingly, triplet excited state lifetimes of the thionated coumarin (0.14&#8197;&#956;s) is much shorter than the unthionated analogues (53.4&#8197;&#956;s). Time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectra indicate much larger zero field splitting (ZFS) D parameters (up to 0.287&#8197;cm&#8722;1) for the T1 state of the thionated coumarins than the unthionated analogues (D=0.1001&#8197;cm&#8722;1). This large D value is attributed to the strong spin orbital coupling effect. These results demonstrate the advantage and the drawback of thionation&#8208;enhanced ISC, i.&#8201;e. the ISC is efficient, but triplet state lifetimes become substantially shorter. This information is useful for the future design of heavy atom&#8208;free triplet photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy, photon upconversion, photocatalytic organic synthesis and photopolymerization, etc.

         <title>Base&#8208;Induced Apparent Inverted Solvatochromism in Pyridinium Phenolates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 21, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effect of base choice on the solvatochromism of &#960;&#8208;extended pyridinium&#8208;phenolate dyes was investigated. UV&#8208;vis absorption spectra revealed that methanolic tetrabutylammonium hydroxide causes apparent inverted solvatochromism in negatively solvatochromic dyes. Based on these findings, recommendations have been made for methodologies used to compare novel solvatochromic dyes against benchmark dyes.







Abstract
Due to conflicting reports regarding the solvatochromism of &#960;&#8208;extended pyridinium&#8208;phenolate dyes, the choice of base (N,N,N&#8216;,N&#8216;&#8208;tetramethylguanidine or 1&#8197;M tetrabutylammonium hydroxide in methanol) used to deprotonate the dyes was investigated. Three known dyes were synthesized and their UV&#8208;vis absorbance spectra were measured in a range of solvent using the two bases and the zwitterionic forms of the dyes. It was found that the methanolic tetrabutylammonium hydroxide could cause the appearance of inverted solvatochromism in negatively solvatochromic dyes when used in solvents of sufficiently low polarity. This was attributed to the presence of the polar, hydrogen bond donating methanol which preferentially solvates the dye, increasing the polarity it observes. Informed by these results, recommendations are presented for the methods used to compare solvatochromic dyes.

         <title>Design, Synthesis, and Biophysical Characterization of Pyridine Bis&#8208;Quinazoline Derivatives as Selective G&#8208;Quadruplex DNA Stabilizers</title>

Fifteen novel pyridine bis&#8208;quinazoline derivatives are designed, synthesized, and evaluated for their ability to selectively bind and stabilize G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) DNA. Biophysical assays reveal strong G4 stabilization and selectivity over double&#8208;stranded DNA, with propylamine linkers showing superior performance. Cell viability studies confirm intracellular activity and anticancer potential, highlighting these compounds as promising G4&#8208;stabilizing agents for drug development.







Abstract
Non&#8208;canonical G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) DNA structures play key roles in cellular regulation and are promising targets for cancer therapy. This study reports the design, synthesis, and biophysical evaluation of 15 novel pyridine bis&#8208;quinazoline derivatives for their ability to selectively bind and stabilize G4 DNA structures. The pyridine&#8208;bis&#8208;quinazoline central fragment was synthesized with various amine side chains via a 4&#8211;5&#8197;step sequence in high yields. Comprehensive analyses using different fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays, fluorescence intercalator displacement (FID), circular dichroism (CD), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) assays revealed strong G4 stabilization and selectivity over double&#8208;stranded DNA. The presence and composition of the aliphatic amine side chain proved critical and propylamine linkers exhibited superior performance, achieving &#916;Tm values exceeding 20&#8201;&#176;C and dissociation constants in the nanomolar range. Structural preferences were observed for parallel and hybrid G4 topologies, and the ligands induced minimal conformational changes in G4 DNA upon binding. Finally, cell viability assays on HCT&#8208;8 and HepG2 cancer cell lines revealed that most ligands effectively entered the cells and decreased cancer cell viability in a dose&#8208;dependent manner. These findings underline the potential of pyridine bis&#8208;quinazoline derivatives as selective G4&#8208;stabilizing agents, paving the way for further exploration in anticancer drug development.

         <title>Highly Defined Layered 2D Sulfur Nanosheets from 0D Sulfur Dots and their use in the Photocatalytic Oxidative Coupling of Aryl Amines to Aromatic Azo Compounds</title>

Formation of 2D multi&#8208;layered sulfur sheets from 0D sulfur dots with improved crystallinity, effective light harvesting, less exciton binding energy with effective free charge carriers separation for efficient photocatalytic activity.







Abstract
A highly defined multi&#8208;layered 2D sulphur nanosheets have been prepared from 0D sulphur dots by hydrothermal based growth process. Slow transformation of sulphur dots to sulphur sheets allow reorganization of elemental sulphur and sulphur containing functional groups, resulting higher crystallinity in sulphur nanosheets with respect to sulphur dots. It is further correlated with the detailed photophysical studies. Low temperature photoluminescence spectra confirm that the exciton binding energy of 2D sulphur sheets are lower than 0D sulphur dots. The exciton&#8208;phonon coupling is also higher in sulphur sheet with respect to sulphur dots. Overall, the photoinduced charge separation process improves throughout the highly defined 2D matrix of sulphur sheets. It is further supported by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and transient photocurrent studies. Finally, both sulphur dots and sulphur sheets have been used for photocatalytic azo bond formation where both photoinduced electrons and holes have been utilized simultaneously. Results suggest almost 3 folds enhancement in catalytic efficiency for sulphur sheets with respect to sulphur dots without any metal co&#8208;catalyst. Controlled experiments suggest that the azo bond formation happens through complete photocatalysis process. Detailed mechanism has been proved by identifying the intermediates and free radicals through photo&#8208;responsive EPR studies and various chemical scavenging experiments.

         <title>Oxidative Addition&#8208;Reductive Elimination Supported by a Ligand&#8208;Element Cooperation at the Arsinidene and Stibinidene Center</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 21, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes a remarkable reactivity of N,C,N&#8208;coordinated stibinidene and arsinidene that includes oxidative addition, tautomerization and reductive elimination steps that are allowed via so&#8208;called element ligand cooperation. The whole reaction sequence is studied form both experimental and theoretical point of view.







Abstract
The treatment of pnictinidenes [2&#8208;(RNHCH2)&#8208;6&#8208;(RN=CH)C6H3]E (1As/Sb) (where E=As or Sb) with benzoyl peroxide provided compounds [2&#8208;(DippNCH2)&#8208;6&#8208;(DippN=CH)C6H3]E(O2CPh) (2As/Sb) as a result of two step procedure, i.&#8201;e. oxidation of the pnictogen centre followed by the elimination of benzoic acid. The reaction between 1As and diphenyl disulfide proceeded in the same vein yielding thiophenol and [2&#8208;(DippNCH2)&#8208;6&#8208;(DippN=CH)C6H3]As(SPh) (3As). Analogous reaction of 1Sb furnished a mixture of [2&#8208;(DippNHCH2)&#8208;6&#8208;(DippN=CH)C6H3]Sb(SPh)2 (3'Sb), [2&#8208;(DippNCH2)&#8208;6&#8208;(DippN=CH)C6H3]Sb(SPh) (3Sb) and PhSH, while NMR studies proved the existence of a dynamic equilibrium between all three compounds in solution and removal of incipient PhSH was necessary for the isolation of 3Sb. Both 1As/Sb smoothly reacted with 2&#8208;nitrosotoluene leading to [2&#8208;(DippNCH2)&#8208;6&#8208;(DippN=CH)C6H3]E(O&#8208;NH&#8208;2&#8208;Me&#8722;Ph) 4As/Sb and with 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazoline&#8208;3,5&#8208;dione giving [2&#8208;(DippNCH2)&#8208;6&#8208;(DippN=CH)C6H3]E[(N(CO)&#8208;NH(CO))N&#8722;Ph] 5As/Sb. All compounds were characterized by IR, Raman, NMR spectroscopy, and the molecular structures, except for 3As and 5Sb, were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Furthermore, we scrutinized the thermally induced reductive elimination of benzoic acid and thiophenol from 2&#8211;3As/Sb, respectively, and that of 4&#8208;phenylurazole from 5As. These eliminations involve C&#8722;H activation at the CH2N group, and the recovery of the pnictinidene center in [2,6&#8208;(RN=CH)2C6H3]E (6As/Sb). Using DFT calculations a plausible mechanism was suggested for all the investigated reactions, which are in good agreement with the experimental observations.

         <title>Multigram Scale Synthesis of Mechanically&#8208;Interlocked Derivatives of SWNT using Mechanochemical Methods</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 21, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We can make mechanically interlocked derivatives of SWNTs (MINTs) using mechanochemistry in multigram scale. The synthesis is super&#8208;fast, requires minimal amounts of solvent and works with both (6,5)&#8208;SWNTs and larger and cheaper TuballTM tubes. With this method, it becomes feasible to use MINTs in real&#8208;world applications, like the reinforcement of polymers.







Abstract
The grinding of chemical reagents enables mixing, promotes molecular collisions, and provides the thermal energy required for chemical reactions, while reducing the need for solvent (often to none) and significantly speeding up reactions. This has made mechanochemistry a powerful alternative to traditional solution chemistry. Here, we show that mechanically interlocked derivatives of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (MINTs) can be made via mechanochemistry in a multigram scale. Compared to the previously reported method in suspension, mechanochemistry allows us to reduce the amount of solvent by two orders of magnitude and the reaction time from 72&#8197;h to 5&#8197;min. The mechanochemical synthesis of MINTs is proven to work both with purified (6,5)&#8208;SWNTs and affordable TuballTM SWNTs, enabling the cheap, fast, and environmentally friendly multigram scale synthesis of MINTs. With this new synthetic methodology, we open the door to the real&#8208;world applications of MINTs in fields such as polymer composites.

         <title>Functionalized Thorium&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for the Photocatalytic Oxidation of 1, 5&#8208;Dihydroxynaphthalene</title>

A mixed &#8208;ligand strategy was adopted to constructed a series of isomorphic Th&#8208;MOFs (Th6&#8208;TCPP, Th6&#8208;Co&#8208;TCPP and Th6&#8208;Ni&#8208;TCPP) using porphyrin ligands and 2, 2&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;5, 5&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (H2bpydc). These catalysts have photosensitive units and Th6 clusters, and were applied to investigated photocatalytic oxidation.







Abstract
It is still a challenging task to rationally design metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) crystal catalysts with excellent light absorption and charge transfer for efficient photocatalytic reactions. In this work, the hexanuclear thorium clusters, porphyrin derivative ligands, and linear carboxylic acid ligands were assemed into Th&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Th6&#8208;TCPP, Th6&#8208;Co&#8208;TCPP, and Th6&#8208;Ni&#8208;TCPP) by the mixed ligand method. The three prepared MOF crystals were applied in the photocatalytic oxidation of 1, 5&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene (1, 5&#8208;DHN) for the synthesis of juglone. Among them, Th6&#8208;TCPP exhibited optimum photodynamic activity for production of reactive oxygen species. Under lillumination, Th6&#8208;TCPP resulted in photochemical reaction conversion rate up to 95&#8201;% for 9, 10&#8208;diphenylanthracene (DPA) and 54.5&#8201;% for 1, 5&#8208;DHN. The good catalytic effect was attributed to the large conjugate system of porphyrin and the enhanced photosensitivity of bipyridine.

         <title>Conjugation Effects in the Generation of Dynamic Covalent Libraries of Bis&#8208;Imines from Substituted Aromatic Aldehyde and Amine Components</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 21, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic conjugation in reactants influences the generation, selectivity and stability of bis&#8208;imines; a cross bis&#8208;imine (A1B1A2) preferentially forms over homologous bis&#8208;imines (A1B1A1 and A2B1A2) in a multi&#8208;component system generating dynamic covalent imine libraries.







Abstract
The conjugation&#8208;driven stability and reactivity of bis&#8208;imine formation from the reaction of substituted aromatic aldehydes and amines bearing electron donor and acceptor groups were studied in two approaches involving aldehydes and amines with the substituents either conjugated (para position) or non&#8208;conjugated (meta position) to the reacting functional groups. The bis&#8208;imine from the reaction of a bis&#8208;amine (B) with different types of aldehydes (A) constituted an ABA module, whereas the reaction of bis&#8208;aldehydes with different amines resulted in a BAB module. The competitive reactions were also studied for a specified bis&#8208;amine (B1 or B2) in similar conditions with a mixture of different aldehydes, and the time&#8208;dependent generations of dynamic covalent libraries were followed. The results indicated that conjugation modulated the bis&#8208;imine formation. The reaction of the conjugated bis&#8208;amine B1 with a mixture of two different aldehydes A1 and A2 favoured the formation of the bis&#8208;imine A1B1A2 involving different aldehydes. The results of the study provide insights into the effect of conjugation on the reactivity and stability of bis&#8208;imines and provide a basis for inducing selectivity features in the formation of bis&#8208;imines from different types of aldehyde and amine groups.

     alt="Conjugation Effects in the Generation of Dynamic Covalent Libraries of Bis-Imines from Substituted Aromatic Aldehyde and Amine Components"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electronic conjugation in reactants influences the generation, selectivity and stability of bis-imines; a cross bis-imine (&lt;b&gt;A1B1A2&lt;/b&gt;) preferentially forms over homologous bis-imines (&lt;b&gt;A1B1A1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;A2B1A2&lt;/b&gt;) in a multi-component system generating dynamic covalent imine libraries.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conjugation-driven stability and reactivity of &lt;i&gt;bis&lt;/i&gt;-imine formation from the reaction of substituted aromatic aldehydes and amines bearing electron donor and acceptor groups were studied in two approaches involving aldehydes and amines with the substituents either conjugated &lt;i&gt;(para&lt;/i&gt; position) or non-conjugated (&lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt; position) to the reacting functional groups. The &lt;i&gt;bis&lt;/i&gt;-imine from the reaction of a &lt;i&gt;bis&lt;/i&gt;-amine (&lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;) with different types of aldehydes (&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;) constituted an &lt;b&gt;ABA&lt;/b&gt; module, whereas the reaction of &lt;i&gt;bis&lt;/i&gt;-aldehydes with different amines resulted in a &lt;b&gt;BAB&lt;/b&gt; module. The competitive reactions were also studied for a specified &lt;i&gt;bis&lt;/i&gt;-amine (&lt;b&gt;B1&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;B2&lt;/b&gt;) in similar conditions with a mixture of different aldehydes, and the time-dependent generations of dynamic covalent libraries were followed. The results indicated that conjugation modulated the &lt;i&gt;bis&lt;/i&gt;-imine formation. The reaction of the conjugated &lt;i&gt;bis&lt;/i&gt;-amine &lt;b&gt;B1&lt;/b&gt; with a mixture of two different aldehydes &lt;b&gt;A1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;A2&lt;/b&gt; favoured the formation of the &lt;i&gt;bis&lt;/i&gt;-imine &lt;b&gt;A1B1A2&lt;/b&gt; involving different aldehydes. The results of the study provide insights into the effect of conjugation on the reactivity and stability of &lt;i&gt;bis&lt;/i&gt;-imines and provide a basis for inducing selectivity features in the formation of &lt;i&gt;bis&lt;/i&gt;-imines from different types of aldehyde and amine groups. They provide an entry into the design of dynamic covalent libraries generated from extended multicomponent systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sulfide Synthesis via A Bioinspired C&#8722;S &#963;&#8208;Bond Metathesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 21, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the natural S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM) cycle, we devised and realized a &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis between the C&#8722;O bond of alcohols with thioethers. This reaction is promoted by a mixture of commonly used Lewis acids and allows fast access to various challenging thioethers from easily available ones by directly editing one alkyl group of the thioether with easily available alcohols as the new alkyl group. Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations were carried out to show a high level of resemblance to the natural SAM cycle.







Abstract
In this manuscript, inspired by the natural S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM) cycle, we devised a mixed &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis between the (sp3)C&#8722;S bond of organic sulfides with the C&#8722;O bond of alcohols. This reaction is mediated by a readily available and operationally facile mixture of AlCl3 and ZnI2, which allows fast access to various challenging organic sulfides by directly editing the (sp3)C&#8722;S bond of easily available ones. Like multiple bond metathesis, this method could also be rendered intramolecular and extended to ether (sp3)C&#8722;O bond metathesis as well as amine (sp3)C&#8722;N bond metathesis to provide saturated heterocycles such as cyclic thioethers, cyclic ethers, as well as cyclic amines. Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations were carried out to show a high level of resemblance to the natural SAM cycle. We anticipate this bioinspired design of C&#8722;S/C&#8722;O metathesis will infuse the area of a &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis with more insights and provide opportunities for further advances in areas that have been facilitated by traditional C&#8722;X bond forming reactions.

         <title>Synthesis of Derivatives of the Antibiotic Albicidin: The N&#8208;Terminal Fragment as Key to Control Potency and Resistance Mediated by the Binding Protein AlbA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 21, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This manuscript gives a deep inside in the structure&#8208;activity relationship of the N&#8208;terminal fragment of the antibiotic albicidin. This study uncovered a new structure scaffold comprising bicyclic aromatics as replacement for albicidin's methyl coumaric acid. Such variations enable the control of the resistance factor AlbA while maintaining excellent antibacterial activity.







Abstract
The peptide albicidin represents a highly promising lead structure which is a first&#8208;in&#8208;class antibiotic with remarkable potency against gram&#8208;negative bacteria. Past efforts in the synthesis of albicidin analogs focused on increasing hydrophilicity, broadening of the antibacterial profile and overcoming resistance. Herein, we present synthetic albicidin derivatives with variations in the N&#8208;terminal building block and characterize their antibacterial activity and DNA gyrase inhibition. Furthermore, we show that the N&#8208;terminus of albicidin greatly affects binding to the resistance factor AlbAL. This transcription regulator senses albicidin and triggers the biosynthesis of the binding protein AlbAS, thus reducing the free concentration of the antibiotic. Here we demonstrate uncoupling of the binding event from transcription activation for some derivatives, and even a few derivatives seemed insensitive to sequestration by AlbA. This approach could be a strategy to develop albicidin analogs escaping AlbA resistance.

         <title>Synthesis and Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Luminescent Properties of Phenylene&#8208;Bridged and Non&#8208;Bridged Boron &#946;&#8208;Dialdiminate Dimers</title>

         <dc:description>
Dimerization of the boron &#946;&#8208;dialdiminate complex provides valuable functional luminescence properties, like solvatochromism, mechanochromism and phosphorescence, which are absent in the parent single molecule. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest that delicately balanced intramolecular electronic interactions should impart the specific excited state characteristics leading to those luminescent behaviors.







Abstract
We report synthesis and optical properties of the dimers of boron &#946;&#8208;dialdiminate (DAI) complexes with different connection manners. The series of dimers, o&#8208;, m&#8208;, p&#8208; and d&#8208;BisDAI, were prepared, and their photophysical properties were compared with the single unit, DAI. It was found that the dimers show characteristic optical properties: o&#8208;BisDAI showed bathochromic shifts in absorption and emission spectra and emission quenching because of the through&#8208;space interactions, while the photophysical properties of m&#8208;BisDAI and DAI were almost identical. The extension of &#960;&#8208;conjugation in p&#8208;BisDAI could induce not only the bathochromic shifts of its absorption and emission bands but also the solvatochromism originating from the symmetry&#8208;breaking charge transfer character. d&#8208;BisDAI showed the weak low&#8208;energy emission in solution and the mechanochromic luminescence which might stem from the rotational degree of freedom between the adjacent two DAI units.

         <title>Simultaneous Construction of Axial and Central Stereogenicity by Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Stereoconvergent Reductive Coupling of Heterobiaryl Triflates and Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 21, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach for highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective reductive coupling of racemic heterobiaryl triflates and aldehydes promoted by a readily available cobalt&#8208;based catalyst was developed. This protocol represents the first example of incorporating a chiral fragment onto the heterobiaryl core, enabling simultaneous construction of central and axial stereogenicity.







Abstract
Catalytic stereoconvergent coupling of racemic heterobiaryl triflates and aldehydes promoted by a readily available chiral cobalt complex is presented. Such processes represent an unprecedented reaction pathway for cobalt catalysis that enable simultaneous construction of axial and central stereogenicity through diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective dynamic kinetic transformations and introduction of a chiral fragment onto the heterobiaryl cores without the requirement of preforming stoichiometric amounts of organometallic reagents, affording densely functionalized secondary alcohols in up to 96&#8201;% yield, &gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;2 dr and &gt;99.5:0.5 er. Preliminary investigations on the application of the products demonstrate their potential for serving as a new class of chiral catalysts and ligands. Mechanistic studies suggest that a dynamic kinetic stereoselective process induced by chiral cobalt catalysis is involved.

Mechanistic studies suggest that a dynamic kinetic stereoselective process induced by chiral cobalt catalysis is involved.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regulating the Ligand N&#8208;Heterocyclic Coordination in Bismuth&#8208;Based MOFs for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 21, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of one N&#8208;heterocyclic pyridine group within the ligand led to an enhanced localized internal electric field (LIEF), which could promote efficient charge separation and enhance the interaction with CO2 molecules, thus improving photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance.







Abstract
The increasing global concern over environmental degradation and resource depletion has driven the search for sustainable technologies to mitigate CO2 emissions. Recently, bismuth&#8208;based metal organic frameworks (Bi&#8208;MOFs) have garnered significant attention due to their high stability, adjustable porosity, and excellent light absorption properties. However, weak visible light absorption and charge recombination are still obstacles to wide application. In this study, a new class of Bi&#8208;MOFs based on tribenzoic acid with different ligand N&#8208;atom number was synthesized by solvothermal method. Experimental and computational results indicated that the introduction of one N&#8208;heterocyclic pyridine group within the ligand led to an enhanced localized internal electric field (LIEF), which could promote efficient charge separation and enhance the interaction with CO2 molecules, thus improving photocatalytic activity. This study highlights the potential of pyridine&#8208;functionalized ligands for the design of high&#8208;performance MOFs for CO2 reduction, providing valuable insights for the development of advanced materials in environmental sustainability efforts.

         <title>Development of Diverse Ligands and Catalysts Derived from Axially Chiral Cyclic Biphenyldiols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 21, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel kind of adjustable axially chiral cyclic biphenyl ligands and catalysts derived from axially chiral CYCNOLs have been developed. The variation of substituent groups at 2,2&#8242;&#8208;positions afforded diverse ligands and catalysts. The precise regulation of multi&#8208;sites including variation of substituent groups at 3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;positions and ring sizes at 6,6&#8242;&#8208;positions, realized the high reactivity and stereoselectivity in asymmetric synthesis.







Abstract
The development of suitable chiral ligands and catalysts is a key factor in asymmetric organic synthesis. In this paper, we describe the design, synthesis and evaluation of a new kind of adjustable axially chiral cyclic biphenyl ligands and catalysts derived from axially chiral cyclic biphenyldiols, and four representative examples were performed well including enantioselective alkynylation of benzo[e][1,2,3]oxathiazine 2,2&#8208;dioxide under catalysis of (R)&#8208;cyclic [1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diol/ZnMe2, palladium&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative cycloaddition of 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;4&#8208;vinyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolan&#8208;2&#8208;one with 2&#8208;arylidenemalononitriles in the presence of axially chiral cyclic phosphoramidite ligand, and axially chiral cyclic phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition of styryl&#8208;1H&#8208;indole with cyclic 2,4&#8208;dienones and asymmetric Michael addition of indolizine to cyclopentenediones. The experiments showed that variation of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;substituent groups could provide different kinds of axially chiral cyclic ligands and catalysts, variation of steric and electronic properties (by changing substituent groups at the 3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;positions) and dihedral angles (by changing ring sizes at 6,6&#8242;&#8208;positions) could greatly change catalytic efficiency of ligands and catalysts derived from axially chiral cyclic biphenyldiols. The high reactivity and stereoselectivity of the reactions were effectively achieved through the precise regulation of multi&#8208;sites on our axially chiral cyclic biphenyldiols.

         <title>A Luminescent Stable Triarylmethyl Diradical with an Axially Chiral Spacer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 21, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a novel boronic ester radical precursor, two units of a highly stable luminescent triarylmethyl radical were bridged with an axially chiral spacer for the first time. The resulting, diradical (R/S)&#8208;1 demonstrated high stability in solution under ambient conditions and exhibited a photoluminescence quantum yield of 10&#8201;%, along with circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in chloroform.







Abstract
Two units of a highly stable luminescent triarylmethyl radical (PyBTM) were bridged using a chiral octahydrobinaphthyl moiety, resulting in a diradical with sufficient stability to enable the measurement of its chiroptical properties. To synthesize this diradical, a novel boronic ester radical precursor, &#945;H&#8208;PyBTM&#8208;B(Epin), was designed. The use of this precursor significantly improved the yield and streamlined the preparation of stable luminescent radical&#8208;substituted molecules. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of the diradical was measured to be 10&#8201;% in chloroform. Furthermore, both circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) were successfully observed.

         <title>Global Spectral Analysis of Polaritonic Coupling of Multiple Organic Dyes to a Tunable Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot Resonator Operating with Mirror Separations up to 10&#8197;&#956;m</title>

         <dc:description>
We demonstrate simultaneous strong coupling of two different J&#8208;aggregated dyes embedded in a tunable Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot resonator at mirror distances exceeding 10&#8197;&#956;m. The observed polariton modes can be modeled by a phenomenological Hamiltonian. Even at very large distances, there are hybrid polaritons present, which contain contributions from both dye molecules, making this system a promising platform for studying polariton&#8208;mediated energy transfer.







Abstract
We study strong optical coupling and the formation of hybrid polaritons by a donor&#8208;acceptor pair of J&#8208;aggregated dyes separated by up to 11&#8197;&#956;m in a tunable Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot resonator. Fitting a phenomenological Hamiltonian to the white light transmission spectra of different cavity&#8208;J&#8208;aggregate&#8208;configurations, for which several hundred spectra were recorded sequentially as function of cavity length, allows us to determine coupling energies as a function of the effective cavity distances. The theoretical analysis shows that certain hybrid polaritons contain contributions from both dyes, making this system a promising platform for polariton&#8208;mediated energy transfer at very large distances.

In order to make available potentionally bioactive new &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonic derivatives, diethyl &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;methylphosphonates were phosphorylated, phosphinoylated and thiophosphinoylated with the corresponding P&#8208;chloride. The effect of a P=O to P=S modification was evaluated by single crystal X&#8208;ray cristallography. Among the phosphorylated and phosphinoylated aminophosphonates a few derivatives revealed moderate cytotoxic effect.







Abstract
In order to make available new derivatives, diethyl &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;methylphosphonates were subjected to phosphorylation, phosphinoylation and even thiophosphinoylation by reaction with phosphoryl chlorides, diphenylphosphinoyl chloride, and with the mixture of diphenylchlorophosphine and elemental sulfur, respectively. The X&#8208;ray crystal structures of the diphenylphosphinoyl and the diphenylthiophosphinoyl derivatives revealed molecular and supramolecular similarities, as well as a few differences too. An essential conformation change, along with packing differences are attributable to a change of one heteroatom: an oxygen for a sulfur in one of the P=X function. The diethyl diethylphosphoryl&#8208;aminobenzylphosphonates showed the highest antiproliferative effects on multiple myeloma cells, while the thiophosphinoylated diethyl aminobenzylphosphonate was the most effective on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells.

         <title>Adaptive Coordination Behavior of Bisphosphanylphosphanido&#8208;Ligands Toward Group 2, 11 and 12 Metal Ions</title>

Combination of 2, 11 and 12 metal ions with a bisphosphanylphosphanide counter anion affords versatile and adaptive coordination motifs, for which NMR parameters (1JPP) serve as an easy and reliable diagnostic tool consistent with the situation in solid state as corroborated by single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography.







Abstract
A series of alkaline earth metal complexes (Mg&#8722;Ba) with the anionic ferrocenylene&#8208;bridged bisphosphanylphosphanide ligand [Fe(C5H4PC4H9)2P]&#8722; has been prepared by metalation of the corresponding bisphosphanylhydrophosphane (Fe(C5H4PC4H9)2PH). The resulting complexes have been characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and SC&#8208;XRD. Furthermore, the closely related zinc phosphanide, and rare, mononuclear coinage metal phosphanides were synthesized and investigated for comparison. The range of coordination modes observed for the phosphanide ligand included mono&#8208;, bi&#8208;, and tridentate modi and their respective combinations, whereas no &#956;2&#8208;bridging of the phosphanide center has been observed. The value of the 1JPP coupling constant was found to be a good probe to track the coordination motif consistent with the situation in solid state.

         <title>Base&#8208;Promoted Homolytic Aromatic Substitution (BHAS) Reactions and Hydrodehalogenations Driven by Green Light and an Iron(III)&#8208;NHC Photoredox Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 21, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we present the application of an Fe(III)&#8208;NHC complex in the intramolecular base&#8208;promoted homolytic aromatic substitution reaction. Milder reaction conditions than previously reported were employed, which tolerated functional groups like an aldehyde and ester. The reaction leads to the predominant formation of the cyclized product (CP) over the hydrodehalogenated product (HP). A mechanism is proposed, supported by extensive mechanistic studies.







Abstract
An Fe(III)&#8208;NHC complex has been employed for the green light driven catalysis of base&#8208;promoted homolytic aromatic substitution (BHAS) reactions. Tributylamine was used as a sacrificial electron donor, together with potassium carbonate as base in dimethyl sulfoxide as solvent. In contrast to previously studied photocatalysts, the excited Fe(III)&#8208;NHC complex is not reducing the arylhalide substrates. Instead, the latter are activated by &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals formed upon reductive quenching of the photocatalyst by tributylamine. Avoiding strongly reducing photocatalysts as well as strong base, these mild reaction conditions allowed for the expansion of the substrate scope to accommodate also aldehyde and ester substituents. 100&#8201;% conversion was obtained after 48&#8197;h of irradiation. In this way a wide variety of cyclized products and their corresponding hydrodehalogenated products were obtained as isolated and pure compounds, in the vast majority of cases.

         <title>Deoxygenative Cyclopropanation of Aldehydes with Acyl&#8208;Stabilized Sulfur Ylides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 21, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we described a novel [1+1+1] deoxygenative cyclopropanation between sulfur ylides and aldehydes, which is distinctive from traditional epoxidation reactions. The method offers a straightforward approach for the synthesis of highly stereoselective, functionalized, and structurally diverse tertiary cyclopropyl thioethers. The reaction demonstrates a broad substrate scope and excellent compatibility with various functional groups, rendering it particularly suitable for the late&#8208;stage modifications of pharmaceuticals and natural products, as well as the synthesis of structurally diverse compounds. Additionally, &#946;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted enals can also engage in the deoxygenative cyclopropanation reaction, instead of undergoing classic cyclopropanation through a Michael addition reaction&#8208;induced cyclization with sulfur ylides, thus yielding synthetically important vinylcyclopropanes with excellent chemoselectivity and diastereoselectivity.

         <title>Confined Structural Water Molecules as Alternative Potential Emitters for Bright Photoluminescence of Thiolate&#8208;Gold Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 21, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlike conventional hydrogen&#8208;bonded water molecules, structural water molecules can form an interface electronic state with &#960;&#8208;bonding properties due to the spatial interaction of the p&#8208;orbitals of two O atoms at the nanoscale, thus acting as emitters for the bright photoluminescence of thiolate&#8208;gold complexes.







Abstract
The debate about water as an emitter has spanned nearly a century, but how it emits bright colors remains elusive. In this report, using the widely used Au(I)&#8208;alkanethiolate complex (Au(I)&#8208;SRs, R=&#8722;(CH2)12H) with AIE properties as a model system, by carefully manipulating the delicate surface&#8208;ligand interactions at the nanoscale interface, together with a careful spectral investigation and an isotopic diagnostic experiment of heavy water (D2O), we demonstrated that the structural water molecules (SWs) trapped in the nanoscale interface or space are the true emission centers of metal nanoclusters (NCs) and the aggregates of Au(I)&#8208;SRs complexes, instead of a well&#8208;organized metal core dominated by quantum confinement mechanics. Unlike conventional hydrogen&#8208;bonded water molecules, due to interfacial adsorption or spatial confinement, the p&#8208;orbitals of two O atoms in SWs can form strong electronic interactions through spatial overlap, thus constructing a set of interfacial states, one of which is characterized by &#960;&#8208;bonding, thus providing alternative channels (or paths) for the relaxation decay of the excited electrons. Using the one&#8208;dimensional free&#8208;electron gas model, the energy levels calculated by the Schr&#246;dinger equation are in perfect agreement with the experimental observations, further validating the SWs model.

In this report, using the widely used Au(I)-alkanethiolate complex (Au(I)-SRs, R=&#8722;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H) with AIE properties as a model system, by carefully manipulating the delicate surface-ligand interactions at the nanoscale interface, together with a careful spectral investigation and an isotopic diagnostic experiment of heavy water (D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), we demonstrated that the structural water molecules (SWs) trapped in the nanoscale interface or space are the true emission centers of metal nanoclusters (NCs) and the aggregates of Au(I)-SRs complexes, instead of a well-organized metal core dominated by quantum confinement mechanics. Unlike conventional hydrogen-bonded water molecules, due to interfacial adsorption or spatial confinement, the &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-orbitals of two O atoms in SWs can form strong electronic interactions through spatial overlap, thus constructing a set of interfacial states, one of which is characterized by &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;-bonding, thus providing alternative channels (or paths) for the relaxation decay of the excited electrons. Using the one-dimensional free-electron gas model, the energy levels calculated by the Schr&#246;dinger equation are in perfect agreement with the experimental observations, further validating the SWs model.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Design and Properties of Azaacene&#8208;Fused Porphyrins: Extending &#960;&#8208;Systems for NIR&#8208;II Absorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 21, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we provide the straightforward synthesis of new azaacene&#8208;fused porphyrins, accompanied by an in&#8208;depth investigation of their optical and electrochemical properties. These experimental findings were further supported by comprehensive theoretical calculations, providing valuable insights into the structure&#8211;property relationship of these compounds.







Abstract
A series of porphyrins featuring various azaacene moieties were designed with the aim to explore the structure&#8211;property relationships in extended azaacene systems. The introduction of azaacene groups significantly enhanced the solubility of these chromophores while directly influencing their electronic absorption and emission properties, enabling absorption at longer wavelengths. Protonation of the azaacene&#8208;fused porphyrins further extended their absorption into the NIR&#8208;II region. The &#960; system extension provided by the new appended diamino aromatic groups were therefore investigated through electrochemical, photophysical, X&#8208;ray diffraction structural studies and complemented by theoretical calculations.

         <title>Twisted Amide&#8208;Mediated Synthesis and Rapid Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship Study of Medium&#8208;Sized Cyclic Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 21, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient methodology for the synthesis of medium&#8208;sized cyclic peptides based on the twisted amide&#8208;mediated amidation strategy was developed. A variety of linear peptides with C&#8208;terminal diversity were synthesized by the &#8220;inverse&#8221; peptide synthesis and epimerization&#8208;suppressed fragment coupling. The resulting linear peptides were cyclized by the intramolecular twisted amide&#8208;mediated amidation to afford stereochemically pure cyclic peptides.







Abstract
Medium&#8208;sized cyclic peptides are expected to be ideal drug leads because these peptides combine the advantages, while compensating for the disadvantages, of small molecules and antibodies. Although medium&#8208;sized peptides can be produced by chemical synthesis, two major problems, namely (i) C&#945;&#8208;epimerization during C&#8208;terminal modification and (ii) side reactions in the cyclization, remain to be solved. These issues have hampered the synthesis of pure materials for bioassays, making it difficult to accomplish accurate structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) studies. Herein, we report an efficient synthesis of medium&#8208;sized cyclic peptides based on the twisted amide&#8208;mediated amidation strategy. First, a variety of linear peptides were synthesized by the &#8220;inverse&#8221; peptide synthesis and fragment coupling. Second, the C&#8208;terminus of the linear peptides were converted to twisted amides, which were then reacted with a variety of &#945;&#8208;amino acyl sulfonamides, realizing the rapid C&#8208;terminal diversification of peptides. Finally, the resulting linear peptides were cyclized by the intramolecular twisted amide&#8208;mediated amidation to afford stereochemically pure cyclic peptides. Using this strategy, total synthesis of acyl&#8208;surugamide A, the stereoselective synthesis of 13 non&#8208;natural analogs, and the discovery of potent antimicrobial/antifungal peptides beyond the natural product were also achieved.

The hand you are dealt: Reduced TcV/ReVI octahedra and fully oxidized TcVII/ReVII tetrahedra self&#8208;assemble, mix and match, and exchange to produce the first group&#8197;VII technetium/rhenium mixed metal polyoxometalate and the first rigorous characterization of a rhenium autoreduction product. Based on both the lability of the polynuclear clusters and trends in reduction, the expansion of nascent group&#8197;VII polyoxometalates is promising. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Nyman and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202404144).

         <title>4&#8208;Exo&#8208;Trig Radical Cyclization: A Promising Approach to Four&#8208;Membered Rings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 21, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig radical cyclization is an attractive method for direct construction of synthetically important but challenging four&#8208;membered rings. This review systematically summarizes the recent advances in this field over the past 20&#8197;years, including processes enabled by SmI2, n&#8208;Bu3SnH, transition metal catalysis, and photocatalyst, respectively, with an emphasis on the analysis of reaction mechanism and selectivity control.







Abstract
The 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig radical cyclization represents a formidable challenge owing to the unfavorable thermodynamics associated with the formation of highly strained four&#8208;membered rings. Stimulated by the explosive advancements of radical chemistry over the past decades, significant progresses have been made in this area, including the SmI2&#8208;mediated 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig carbonyl&#8208;alkene cyclization, n&#8208;Bu3SnH&#8208;mediated 4&#8208;exo cyclization of functionalized alkenes or alkynes, transition metal&#8208;catalyzed 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig ring closures, and visible light&#8208;induced 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization cascade, providing efficient protocols to overcome the inherent limitations and expand the synthetic utility of this methodology. Representative examples, reaction mechanism, scope and limitations, and synthetic applications are presented and discussed in detail. We believe that the systematic review of recent advances on 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig radical cyclization will provide more insights in this field, and may enable further development of this cyclization process for the concise synthesis of four&#8208;membered carbo&#8208; and heterocycles that are difficult to access via traditional methods.

         <title>Osteosarcoma Cell and Osteosarcoma Stem Cell Potent Immunogenic Bi&#8208;nuclear Gallium(III) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis, characterisation, anti&#8208;osteosarcoma and anti&#8208;osteosarcoma stem cells (OSC) properties (cytotoxic and immunogenic) of a series of bi&#8208;nuclear gallium(III) complexes with tridentate Schiff base ligands and 8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline (1&#8208;4). According to monolayer cytotoxicity studies, 1&#8208;4 display micromolar potency towards bulk osteosarcoma cells and OSCs. The most effective complex in the series 2 is up to 13&#8208;fold more potent towards OSCs than cisplatin and carboplatin (the only metallodrugs used in the clinic to treat osteosarcoma). Remarkably, the bi&#8208;nuclear gallium(III) complexes 1&#8208;4 are significantly more potent towards three&#8208;dimensionally cultured sarcospheres than OSCs cultured in monolayers indicating effective penetration of the sarcosphere multicellular architecture. The bi&#8208;nuclear gallium(III) complexes 1&#8208;4 are up to 53&#8208;fold more potent towards sarcospheres than cisplatin and carboplatin. Mechanistic studies show that gallium(III) complex 2 kills osteosarcoma cells by caspase&#8208;dependent apoptosis and paraptosis, leading to the release of danger&#8208;associated molecular patterns associated to immunogenic cell death. Osteosarcoma cells and OSCs treated with gallium(III) complex 2 are effectively phagocytosed by immune cells, highlighting its immunogenic potential. As far as we are aware, gallium(III) complex 2 is the first metal complex to evoke an immunogenic response towards both bulk osteosarcoma cells and OSCs.</dc:description>
