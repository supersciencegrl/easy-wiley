      <title>Systematic structural characterization of chitooligosaccharides enabled by Automated Glycan Assembly</title>
      <dc:description>Chitin, a polymer composed of &#946;(1&#8208;4)&#8208;linked N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;glucosamine monomers, and its partially deacetylated analogue chitosan, are abundant biopolymers with outstanding mechanical as well as elastic properties. Their degradation products, chitooligosaccharides (COS), can trigger the innate immune response in humans and plants. Both material and biological properties are dependent on polymer length, acetylation, as well as the pH. Without well&#8208;defined samples, a complete molecular description of these factors is still missing. Automated Glycan Assembly (AGA) enabled rapid access to synthetic well&#8208;defined COS. Chitin&#8208;cellulose hybrid oligomers were prepared as important tools for a systematic structural analysis. Intramolecular interactions, identified by molecular dynamics simulations and NMR analysis, underscore the importance of the chitosan amino group for the stabilization of specific geometries.</dc:description>

      <title>From Carbohydrates to Complex Organofluorines: Synthesis, Conformation, and Lipophilicity of Multi&#8208;Vicinal Fluorine&#8208;Containing Hexitol Analogues</title>
      <dc:description>There is growing interest in the preparation of fluorine&#8208;containing organic molecules. Multi&#8208;vicinal fluorine analogues are among the most intriguing and promising compounds but their physical and biological investigations suffer from challenging syntheses. Hence, we report on the synthesis of a large set of novel polyfluorohexitols. The determination of the dominant solution&#8208;state conformation of all trifluorohexitol was achieved, along with the comparison of solid&#8208;state conformation of some analogues. Finally, the lipophilicity of a large set of polyfluorinated hexopyranose and hexitol analogues was attributed using a log  P  determination method based on  19  F NMR spectroscopy.</dc:description>

      <title>Tunable Synthesis of Hierarchical Yolk/Double&#8208;Shelled SiOx@TiO2@C Nanospheres for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Yolk/double&#8208;shelled SiOx@TiO2@C nanospheres with different voids were successfully prepared, and the regulation of SiOx yolk was achieved by changing the etching time. The etching time of SiOx yolk affects the morphology and electrochemical performance of SiOx@TiO2@C. The dial represents the etching time of SiOx yolk in NaOH solution and the brightness of the Chinese red lantern represents the electrochemical performance of the composites. When the etching time is 60&#8197;min, SiOx@TiO2@C with 30&#8197;nm void exhibits remarkable performance as an anode for lithium&#8211;ion batteries.

      <title>In Situ Corrosion Fabrication of NaNbO3/Nb3O7F Heterojunctions with Optimized Band Realignment for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
      <dc:description>Heterostructured photocatalysis is a significant issue&#160;due to the unique band alignment, improved spectrum absorption and enhanced photocatalytic activity. However, constructing uniform, controllable and effective heterojunctions still keeps a huge challenge&#160;up to now. Herein, NaNbO3/Nb3O7F&#160;heterojunctions were fabricated by an  in situ  &#160;corrosion technique for the first time. The influence of phase transformation on the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity was investigated systematically&#160;  via  &#160;the photocatalytic water splitting for H2  production. Interestingly, the band realignment and good interfacial contact endowed NaNbO3/Nb3O7F&#160;heterojunctions with higher HER activity (43.3 mmol&#8226;g&#8208;1  h&#8208;1  ), about 2.4 times of pure Nb3O7F&#160;(mmol&#8226;g&#8208;1  h&#8208;1  ) and 1.36 times of pure NaNbO3  (mmol&#8226;g&#8208;1  h&#8208;1  ).

      <title>Experimental and Computational Study on the Anti&#8208;Markovnikov Hydrofunctionalization of Olefins Using Glycine&#8208;Extended AQ&#8208;Auxiliaries</title>
      <dc:description>Two similar tridentate directing groups derived from glycine and 8&#8208;aminoquinoline were shown to enable the palladium&#8208;catalyzed anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydrofunctionalization of 4&#8208;pentenylamine with drastically different efficiencies. Computational investigation into the origin of the reactivity difference between these isomeric, carbonyl&#8208;transposed auxiliaries suggests that protonation state, thus charge of the substrate&#8208;metal complex prior to nucleopalladation is key.

      <title>Fluorescent Imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrimidine Compounds as Biocompatible Organic Photosensitizers that Generate Singlet Oxygen: A Potential Tool for Phototheranostics</title>
      <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy has been used to treat a variety of diseases, however there is a continuous search for new biocompatible photosensitizers. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that imidazo[1,2&#8208;  a  ]pyrimidine compounds are able to generate singlet oxygen species, and can act as photosensitizers in the intracellular environment. Our results show that this class of compounds absorbs and emits in the 400&#8208;500 nm region, presents low cytotoxicity in the dark, is efficiently uptaken by cells, is fluorescent in the intracellular medium, and generates singlet oxygen upon irradiation killing cancer cells within 2 h at low concentration (2.0 &#181;M). The imidazo[1,2&#8208;  a  ]pyrimidine compounds are a potential new tool for phototheranostics because they can be simultaneously used for fluorescence imaging and photodynamic therapy.</dc:description>

      <title>Personalized Reusable Face Masks with Smart Nano&#8208;Assisted Destruction of Pathogens for COVID&#8208;19: a Visionary Road</title>
      <dc:description>The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID&#8208;19) emergency has demonstrated that the utilization of face masks plays a critical role in limiting the outbreaks. Healthcare professionals utilize masks all day long without replacing them very frequently, thus representing a source of cross&#8208;infection for patients and themselves. Nanotechnology is a powerful tool with the capability to produce nanomaterials with unique physicochemical and anti&#8208;pathogen properties. Here, we outline how to realize non&#8208;disposable and highly comfortable respirators with light&#8208;triggered self&#8208;disinfection ability by bridging bioactive nanofiber properties and stimuli&#8208;responsive nanomaterials. The visionary road highlighted in this Concept is based on the possibility to develop a new generation of masks based on multifunctional membranes where the presence of nanoclusters and plasmonic nanoparticles arranged in a hierarchical structure enables the realization of a chemically&#8208;driven and on&#8208;demand anti&#8208;pathogen activities. Multilayer electrospun membranes have the ability to dissipate humidity present within the mask, enhancing the wearability and usability. The photo&#8208;thermal disinfected membrane is the core of these 3D printed and reusable masks with moisture pump capability. Personalized face masks with smart nano&#8208;assisted destruction of pathogens will bring enormous advantages to the entire global community, especially for front&#8208;line personnel, and will open up great opportunities for innovative medical applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Ditopic Chelators of Dicopper Centers for an Enhancement of Tyrosinases Inhibition</title>
      <dc:description>Tyrosinase enzymes (Tys) are involved in the key steps of melanin (protective pigments) biosynthesis and molecules targeting the binuclear copper active site on tyrosinases represent a relevant strategy to regulate enzyme activities. In this work, we studied the possible synergic effect generated by combination of known inhibitors. For this, derivatives containing kojic acid (KA) and 2&#8208;Hydroxypyridine&#8208;  N  &#8208;oxide (HOPNO) combined with a thiosemicarbazone (TSC) moiety were synthetized. Their inhibition activities were evaluated on purified tyrosinases from different sources (mushroom, bacterial and human) as well as on melanin production by lysats from human melanoma MNT&#8208;1 cell line. Results showed significant enhancement of the inhibitory effects compared to the parent compounds, in particular for HOPNO&#8208;TSC. In order to elucidate the interaction mode with the dicopper(II) active site, we investigated the binding studies towards a tyrosinase bio&#8208;inspired model of the dicopper(II) center. The structure of the isolated adduct between one ditopic inhibitor (KA&#8208;TSC) and the model complex reveals that the binding to a dicopper center can occur with both chelating sites. Computational studies on model complexes and docking studies on enzymes led to the identification of KA and HOPNO moieties as interacting groups with the dicopper active site.</dc:description>

      <title>Frontispiece: Precise Macroscopic Supramolecular Assemblies: Strategies and Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Macroscopic supramolecular assemblies (MSAs) are non&#8208;covalent multivalent interactions between two macroscopic building blocks with a size large than 10&#8197;&#956;m and modified with supramolecular groups. With an increased size of interactive surface areas and groups, the problem of assembly precision in MSAs is difficult. Strategies to increase the precision of MSA structures mainly include (1)&#8197;control over assembly kinetics based on self&#8208;propulsion and pre&#8208;alignment via long ranged forces, and (2)&#8197;self&#8208;correction via iterative disassembly/re&#8208;assembly cycles to convert metastable structures into thermodynamically stable ones. The interference of assembly kinetics and thermodynamics could either directed assembly of designated structures or conversion of metastable assemblies into stable ones.

      <dc:description>
Assisted tandem catalysis via structural change of the Grubbs catalyst with molecular oxygen as a chemical trigger is depicted in the image. The tandem process is initiated by the ring&#8208;closing metathesis (the first gear located in the lower&#8208;left), followed by oxygen mediated in situ transformation of the Grubbs catalyst to the Ru&#8208;CO complex (the second gear located in the upper side), which finally catalyzes aerobic dehydrogenation of N&#8208;heterocycles to N&#8208;heteroarenes (the third gear located in the right). The tandem process was applied to total synthesis of pyocyanine. For more information, see the Communication from H. Tokuyama et al. on page 15793.

      <title>Controlled Shape&#8211;Evolution of Pure&#8208;MOF 1D&#8208;Microcrystals towards Efficient Waveguide and Laser Applications</title>
      <dc:description>MOF&#8208;based one&#8208;dimensional materials have received increasing attention in nanophotonics field, but it is still diffcult in the flexible shape&#8211;evolution of MOF micro/nanocrystals for desired optical functionalities due to the susceptible solvothermal growth process. Herein, we report on the well&#8208;controlled shape&#8211;evolution of pure&#8208;MOF microcrystals with optical waveguide and lasing performances based on a bottom&#8208;up &amp; top&#8208;down synergistic method. The MOF microcrystals from solvethermol synthesis (bottom&#8208;up) enable to evolve from microrods via microtubes to nanowires through a chelating agent&#8208;assisted etching process (top&#8208;down). The three types of MOF 1D&#8208;microstructures with high crystallinity and smooth surfaces all exhibit efficient optical waveguide performance. Furthermore, MOF nanowire with lowest propagation loss served as low&#8208;threshold pure&#8208;MOF nanolasers with Fabry&#8722;P&#233;rot resonance. These results advance the fundamental understanding on the controlled MOF evolution mechanism, and offer a valuable route for the development of pure&#8208;MOF&#8208;based photonic components with desired functionalities.</dc:description>

      <title>Silicon&#8211;Nitrogen Bond Formation via Heterodehydrocoupling and Catalytic N&#8208;Silylation</title>
      <dc:description>
A catalytic block party: Heterodehydrocoupling and N&#8208;silylation are atom&#8208;economical methods for the synthesis of silicon&#8211;nitrogen small molecules, polymers, and materials. Various catalysts across the periodic table are capable of producing silicon&#8211;nitrogen bonds. A thorough report of catalysts, their reactivities, and mechanisms are reported in this Minireview.







Abstract
Silicon&#8211;nitrogen bond formation is an important subfield in main group chemistry, and catalysis is an attractive route for efficient, selective formation of these bonds. Indeed, heterodehydrocoupling and N&#8208;silylation offer facile methods for the synthesis of small molecules through the coupling of primary, secondary, and tertiary silanes with N&#8208;containing substrates such as amines, carbazoles, indoles, and pyrroles. However, the reactivity of these catalytic systems is far from uniform, and critical issues are often encountered with product selectivity, conversions, substrate scope, catalyst activation, and in some instances, competing side reactions. Herein, a catalogue of catalysts and their reactivity for Si&#8722;N heterodehydrocoupling and N&#8208;silylation are reported.

      <title>Synthesis of Mixed&#8208;Functionalized Tetraacylgermanes</title>
      <dc:description>
Mixed functionalized tetraacylgermanes were synthesized by two innovative pathways. The entry in both strategies was provides by tetrakis(trimethylsilyl)germane. In both routes, the crucial intermediate, the germenolate, was formed, leading to the desired products. These new derivatives outperform the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art germanium&#8208;based photoinitiators in terms of solubility and absorption properties.

      <title>Breslow Intermediates (Amino Enols) and Their Keto Tautomers: First Gas&#8208;Phase Characterization by IR Ion Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>
Breslow Intermediates are of pivotal importance for chemical and biological Umpolung reactions catalyzed by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs). In the sense of John&#8197;B. Fenn (NP 2002), attachment of a charge tag to these &#8220;molecular elephants&#8221; provides them with &#8220;electrospray wings&#8221;, and for the first time allows their gase&#8208;phase structural characterization by infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy. The enol&#8208;ketone tautomerism of a number of NHC&#8208;aldehyde combinations, crucial for their chemical reactivity, have been determined in the gas&#8208;phase and interpreted by DFT calculations. More information can be found in the Full Paper by M. Breugst, A.&#8197;J.&#8197;H.&#8197;M. Meijer, M. Sch&#228;fer, A. Berkessel, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202003454).

      <title>Water Formation in Non&#8208;Hydrolytic Sol&#8211;Gel Routes: Selective Synthesis of Tetragonal and Monoclinic Mesoporous Zirconia as a Case Study</title>
      <dc:description>
Water in non&#8208;hydrolytic sol&#8208;gel: In situ water formation during the synthesis of mesoporous zirconia has been systematically investigated. Significant amounts of water were found in several cases, notably in the reactions of Zr(OnPr)4 with ketones and of ZrCl4 with alcohols or acetone. Conversely, the reactions of Zr(OnPr)4 with acetic anhydride or benzyl alcohol at moderate temperature (200&#8201;&#176;C) and of ZrCl4 with diisopropyl ether were strictly non&#8208;hydrolytic. Water played a major role on the structure of the final zirconia: tetragonal ZrO2 was favored in strictly non&#8208;hydrolytic routes, while monoclinic ZrO2 was favored in the presence of water. More information can be found in the Full Paper by P.&#8197;H. Mutin et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202003081).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In cellulo generation of fluorescent probes&lt;/b&gt; is an essential tool in chemical biology to visualize the dynamics of biological processes in real&#8208;time. A highly flexible in cellulo fluorogenic click chemistry strategy was developed and tested for the precise detection and tracking of inflammation and cancer biomarker cyclooxygenase&#8208;2 (COX&#8208;2) in live cells with superior sensitivity in the visible range.

      <dc:description>
The photo&#8208;induced formation of a quartet state in a molecular conjugate consisting of a porphyrin and a trityl moiety is depicted in the cover image. Such photogenerated multi&#8208;spin systems hold great promise for applications in quantum information technology, artificial photosynthesis, as well as spin catalysis. The quartet state formation was scrutinised by femtosecond UV/Vis absorption and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies, providing unique insight into the excited state reaction mechanism.

The excellent performance of CeO2 for imine synthesis at low temperature is highlighted in the cover image. A template&#8208;induced homogeneous precipitation method was used to prepare high&#8208;surface&#8208;area mesoporous CeO2 that carries abundant surface oxygen vacancies attached to coordinatively unsaturated Ce3+ ions.

      <title>How Oriented External Electric Fields Modulate Reactivity</title>
      <dc:description>A judiciously oriented external electric field (OEEF) can catalyze a wide range of reactions and can even induce&#160;endo/exostereoselectivity of cycloaddition reactions. We study the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between cyclopentadiene and maleic anhydride using quantitative activation strain and Kohn&#8208;Sham molecular orbital theory to pinpoint the origin of these catalytic and stereoselective effects. Our quantitative model reveals that an OEEF along the reaction axis induces an enhanced electrostatic and orbital interaction between the reactants, which in turn lowers the reaction barrier. The stronger electrostatic interaction originates from an increased electron density difference between the reactants at the reactive center, while the enhanced orbital interaction arises from the promoted normal electron demand donor&#8211;acceptor interaction driven by the OEEF. An OEEF perpendicular to the plane of the reaction axis solely stabilizes the&#160;exo&#160;pathway of this reaction while the&#160;endo&#160;pathway remains unaltered and efficiently steers the&#160;endo/exo&#160;stereoselectivity. Furthermore, we have also investigated the influence of OEEFs on the inverse electron demand Diels&#8208;Alder reaction, which, unexpectedly, inhibits the reaction, as the electric field now suppresses the critical inverse electron demand donor&#8211;acceptor interaction.</dc:description>

      <title>Ni2P Nanoalloy as an Air&#8208;Stable and Versatile Hydrogenation Catalyst in Water: P&#8208;Alloying Strategy for Designing Smart Catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>Non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based hydrogenation catalysts have limited practical applications because they exhibit low activity, require harsh reaction conditions, and are unstable in air. To overcome these limitations, herein we propose the alloying of non&#8208;noble metal nanoparticles with phosphorus as a promising strategy for developing smart catalysts that exhibit both excellent activity and air stability. We synthesized a novel nickel phosphide nanoalloy (nano&#8208;Ni2P) with coordinatively unsaturated Ni active sites. Unlike conventional air&#8208;unstable non&#8208;noble metal catalysts, nano&#8208;Ni2P retained its metallic nature in air, and exhibited a high activity for the hydrogenation of various substrates with polar functional groups, such as aldehydes, ketones, nitriles, and nitroarenes to the desired products in excellent yields in water. Furthermore, the used nano&#8208;Ni2P catalyst was easy to handle in air and could be reused without pretreatment, providing a simple and clean catalyst system for general hydrogenation reactions.</dc:description>

      <title>Covalency in Actinide Compounds</title>
      <dc:description>Covalency in actinides has emerged as a resounding research topic on account of the technological importance in separating minor actinides from lanthanides for spent nuclear fuel processing, and utilization of their distinct bonding properties has been realized as a route towards overcoming this challenge. Because of the&#160; limited radial extent of the 4  f  orbitals , there is almost no 4  f  &#160;electron participation in bonding in lanthanides; this is not the case for the actinides, which have extended 5  f  &#160;orbitals that are capable of overlapping with ligand orbitals, although not to the degree of overlap as in the&#160;  d  &#160;orbitals of transition metals. In this concept paper, we provide a general description of covalency in actinide compounds. After introducing two main approaches to enhance covalency, either by exploiting increased orbital overlap or decreasing energy differences between the orbitals causing orbital energy degeneracy, we show the current state of the field using several examples from the recent literature. We will conclude by proposing the use of actinide chalcogenides as a convenient auxiliary tool to study covalency in actinide compounds.</dc:description>

We show that gold catalysts play a distinct role in enabling a multiple CH functionalization reaction to introduce up to six carbene fragments onto molecules containing multiple carbazole units or to link multiple carbazole units in one molecule.

      <title>Stereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Synthesis of Propionate&#8208;Derived&#160;Trisubstituted Alkene Motifs</title>
      <dc:description>We report a new method for constructing propionate&#8208;derived trisubstituted alkene motifs in a stereoselective manner. 1&#8208;Substituted 1,1&#8208;di(pinacolatoboryl)&#8208;(E)&#8208;alk&#8208;2&#8208;enes are in situ generated from 1&#8208;substituted 1,1&#8208;di(pinacolatoboryl)alk&#8208;3&#8208;enes through ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed double&#8208;bond transposition. These species undergo a chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed allylation reaction of aldehydes to produce the E isomers of anti&#8208;homoallylic alcohols. On the other hand, the corresponding Z isomers of anti&#8208;homoallylic alcohols are obtained when a dimeric palladium(I) complex is employed as the catalyst for this double&#8208;bond transposition. Thus, both E and Z isomers can be synthesized from the same starting materials. A B&#8211;C(sp2) bond remaining with the allylation product undergoes the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction to furnish a propionate&#8208;derived trisubstituted alkene motif in a stereo&#8208;defined form. The present method to construct the motifs with (E)&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;alkenes are successfully applied to the syntheses of (+)&#8208;isotrichostatic acid, (&#8211;)&#8208;isotrichostatin RK, and (+)&#8208;trichostatic acid, respectively.</dc:description>

      <title>Controlling Spin&#8208;Correlated Radical Pairs with Donor&#8722;Acceptor Dyads: A New Concept to Generate Reduced Metal Complexes for More Efficient Photocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>One&#8208;electron reduced metal complexes derived from photoactive ruthenium or iridium complexes are important intermediates for substrate activation steps in photoredox catalysis and for the photocatalytic generation of solar fuels. However, owing to the heavy atom effect, direct photochemical pathways to these key intermediates suffer from intrinsic efficiency problems resulting from rapid geminate recombination of radical pairs within the so&#8208;called solvent cage. In this study, we prepared and investigated molecular dyads capable of producing reduced metal complexes via an indirect pathway relying on a sequence of energy and electron transfer processes between a Ru complex and a covalently connected anthracene moiety. Our test reaction to establish the proof of concept is the photochemical reduction of ruthenium(tris)bipyridine by the ascorbate dianion as sacrificial donor in aqueous solution. The photochemical key step in the Ru&#8208;anthracene dyads is the reduction of a purely organic (anthracene) triplet excited state by the ascorbate dianion, yielding a spin&#8208;correlated radical pair whose (unproductive) recombination is strongly spin&#8208;forbidden. By carrying out detailed laser flash photolysis investigations, we provide clear evidence for the indirect reduced metal complex generation mechanism and show that this pathway can outperform the conventional direct metal complex photoreduction. The further optimization of our approach involving relatively simple molecular dyads might result in novel photocatalysts that convert substrates with unprecedented quantum yields.</dc:description>

However, until now, there have been rarely direct evidence trying to experimentally detect the existence of MAI or PbI terminations on MAPbI3  grains, let along disclosing their effects on the humidity degradation pathway of perovskite solar cell.

While, for the PbI&#8208;terminated perovskite film in humidity, a deprotonation degradation pathway was confirmed, in which it preferred to directly degrade from MAPbI3  into PbI2, while the iodine defects here played a key role in promoting the dissociation of water molecules into hydroxyl OH&#8208;  and further catalyzing the decomposition of perovskite.</dc:description>

      <title>Iodonium Cation&#8208;Pool Electrolysis for the Three&#8208;Component Synthesis of 1,3&#8208;Oxazoles</title>
      <dc:description>
Cation&#8208;pool electrolysis: The iodonium cation&#8208;pool electrolysis is the key&#8208;step in the three&#8208;component synthesis of 1,3&#8208;oxazoles by a stepwise [2+2+1] cycloaddition of internal alkynes in water&#8208;containing acetonitrile (see scheme).







Abstract
The synthesis of 1,3&#8208;oxazoles from symmetrical and unsymmetrical alkynes was realized by an iodonium cation&#8208;pool electrolysis of I2 in acetonitrile with a well&#8208;defined water content. Mechanistic investigations suggest that the alkyne reacts with the acetonitrile&#8208;stabilized I+ ions, followed by a Ritter&#8208;type reaction of the solvent to a nitrilium ion, which is then attacked by water. The ring closure to the 1,3&#8208;oxazoles released molecular iodine, which was visible by the naked eye. Also, some unsymmetrical internal alkynes were tested and a regioselective formation of a single isomer was determined by two&#8208;dimensional NMR experiments.

      <title>Mechanistic Investigation on Chemiluminescent Formaldehyde Probes</title>
      <dc:description>A first&#8208;generation pair of chemiluminescent formaldehyde (FA) probes&#160;(CFAP540 and CFAP700) was reported recently. CFAP540 and CFAP700 with high selectivity and sensitivity to FA, are respectively suitable in cell and in vivo. Experimentalists have confirmed that both probes utilize a general 2&#8208;aza&#8208;Cope FA&#8208;reactive trigger and a chemiluminogenic phenoxydioxetane scaffold. The mechanism and detailed process of CFAP chemiluminescence (CL) remain largely unknown. In the present paper, we performed (time&#8208;dependent) density functional theory calculations on the entire reaction process of CFAP540 with FA to produce CL. The calculations elucidated the CL producing process: FA initiates the decomposition of CFAP540 by dehydration condensation, and a phenoxy 1,2&#8208;dioxetane is formed through a series of reactions of aza&#8208;Cope rearrangement, hydrolysis of imine, and &#946;&#8208;elimination of alkoxyl group. Afterwards, the produced phenoxy 1,2&#8208;dioxetane decomposes to produce m&#8208;oxybenzoate derivative at the first singlet state (S1) via two crossings between potential energy surfaces of the ground state (S0) and S1 state. This m&#8208;oxybenzoate derivative was assigned to the light emitter of the CFAP540 CL. The CL producing process and assignment of the light emitter of CFAP700 CL are similar with the corresponding ones of CFAP540. By analyzing the D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A architecture of the light emitters of CFAP540 and CFAP700, we theoretically designed a series of CFAPs and proposed a scheme to modulate their CL from visible to near&#8208;infrared region by adjusting the length and structure of the &#960;&#8208;bridge.</dc:description>

The mechanism and detailed process of CFAP chemiluminescence (CL) remain largely unknown. In the present paper, we performed (time&#8208;dependent) density functional theory calculations on the entire reaction process of CFAP540 with FA to produce CL. The calculations elucidated the CL producing process: FA initiates the decomposition of CFAP540 by dehydration condensation, and a phenoxy 1,2&#8208;dioxetane is formed through a series of reactions of aza&#8208;Cope rearrangement, hydrolysis of imine, and &#946;&#8208;elimination of alkoxyl group. Afterwards, the produced phenoxy 1,2&#8208;dioxetane decomposes to produce m&#8208;oxybenzoate derivative at the first singlet state (S1) via two crossings between potential energy surfaces of the ground state (S0) and S1 state. This m&#8208;oxybenzoate derivative was assigned to the light emitter of the CFAP540 CL. The CL producing process and assignment of the light emitter of CFAP700 CL are similar with the corresponding ones of CFAP540. By analyzing the D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A architecture of the light emitters of CFAP540 and CFAP700, we theoretically designed a series of CFAPs and proposed a scheme to modulate their CL from visible to near&#8208;infrared region by adjusting the length and structure of the &#960;&#8208;bridge.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Direct Synthesis of Unsymmetrical Dithioacetals</title>
      <dc:description>Dithioacetals are a frequently used motif in synthetic organic chemistry and have recently seen increasing attention as structural motif in promising antiviral agents against plant pathogens. Most existing reports, however, only discuss symmetrical dithioacetals. Examples of mixed dithioacetals are scarce and no general method for the selective synthesis of these compounds exists. Herein, we present a synthetically simple general one&#8208;step protocol for the synthesis of a broad range of unsymmetrical dithioacetals consisting of one aromatic and one aliphatic thiol moiety from the corresponding aldehyde/thiol mixture. The mixed  S  ,  S  &#8208;acetals are obtained is high yields and a great variety of functional groups is tolerated. Kinetic control enables an excellent selectivity in regard to the unsymmetrical dithioacetal.</dc:description>

      <title>D&#8208;A Interactions Induced Interfacial Synthesis of Ultrathin Fluoric Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymer via Photochemical [2 + 2] Cycloaddition</title>
      <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional polymers (2DPs) have attracted much interest due to their unique 2D atomic&#8208;thick covalent network with periodically linked monomers. The preparation of mono&#8208; or few&#8208;layered 2DPs with highly ordered structures is still a big challenge. Here, we report a preparation of ultrathin 2DP film based on photo&#8208;triggered [2 + 2] cycloaddition at the air/water interface. The pre&#8208;assembly process induced by the D&#8208;A interactions before the polymerization plays a key role in constructing highly ordered structure. The precise structure and chemical compositions of the continuous 2DP films were proved by selected area electron diffraction (SAED), tip&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (TERS) and molecular&#8208;mechanics&#8208;based structural simulation.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Universal&#160;access to clean water has been the global ambition over the years. Photocatalytic water disinfection via advanced oxidation processes has been regarded as one of the promising methods in breaking down microbials. The forefront of this research focuses on the application of metal&#8208;free photocatalysts for disinfection to prevent secondary pollution. Graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) has achieved instant notoriety as a metal&#8208;free and visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive photocatalyst for various energy and environmental applications.

In this contribution, two&#8208;dimensional protonated g&#8208;C3N4  was employed as metal&#8208;free photocatalyst for water treatment and demonstrated 100% disinfection of  Escherichia coli  within 4 h under 23 W light bulb irradiation. The introduction of protonation can modulate the surface charge of g&#8208;C3N4  which enhance its conductivity and provide a &#8220;highway&#8221; for the delocalization of electrons.

      <title>Ferrous to ferric transition in Fe&#8208;phthalocyanine driven by NO2 exposure</title>
      <dc:description>Due to its unique magnetic properties offered by the open&#8208;shell electronic structure of the central metal ion, and for being an effective catalyst in a wide variety of reactions, iron phthalocyanine has drawn significant interest from the scientific community. Nevertheless, upon surface deposition, the magnetic properties of the molecular layer can be significantly affected by the coupling occurring at the interface, and the more reactive the surface, the stronger is the impact on the spin state. Here we show that on Cu(100), indeed, the strong hybridization between the Fe  d  &#8208;states of FePc and the  sp  band of the copper substrate modifies the charge distribution in the molecule, significantly influencing the magnetic properties of the iron ion. The Fe  II  ion is stabilized in the low singlet spin state (S=0), leading to the complete quenching of the molecule&#8217;s magnetic moment. By exploiting the FePc/Cu(100) interface, we demonstrate that NO  2  dissociation can be used to gradually change the magnetic properties of the iron ion, by trimming the gas dosage. For lower doses, the FePc film is decoupled from the copper substrate, restoring the gas phase triplet spin state (S=1). A higher dose induces the transition from ferrous to ferric phthalocyanine, in its intermediate spin state, with enhanced magnetic moment due to the interaction with the atomic ligands. Remarkably, in this way, three different spin configurations have been observed within the same metalorganic/metal interface by exposing it to different doses of NO  2  at room temperature.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Ag(I)&#8208;promoted reaction of thiolactams with N&#8208;Boc amino acids yields an N&#8208;(&#945;&#8208;aminoacyl) lactam that can rearrange through an acyl transfer process. Boc&#8208;deprotection results in convergence to the ring&#8208;expanded adduct, thereby facilitating an overall insertion of an amino acid into the thioamide bond to generate medium&#8208;sized heterocycles. Application to the site&#8208;specific insertion of amino acids into cyclic peptides is demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>seco&#8208;Labdanes: a Study of Terpenoid Structural Diversity Resulting from Biosynthetic C&#8211;C Bond Cleavage</title>
      <dc:description>The cleavage of a C&#8211;C bond is a complexity generating process which complements oxidation and cyclisation events in the biosynthesis of terpenoids.&#160;This process leads to increased structural diversity in a cluster of related secondary metabolites by modification of the parent carbocyclic core. In this review, we highlight the diversifying effect of C&#8211;C bond cleavage by examining the literature related to&#160;seco&#8208;labdanes&#8212;a class of diterpenoid arising from such C&#8211;C bond cleavage events.</dc:description>

Herein, we report the first example of a radical&#8208;generating system that does not require any photoirradiation, radical initiators, or preactivated substrates. The oxidative C&#8211;C&#8208;bond cleavage of 2&#8208;substituted cyclohexanones was achieved using an azolium salt and a hydroquinone as co&#8208;catalysts.

      <title>&#960;&#8208;Bridge Substitution in DASAs: the Subtle Equilibrium Between Photochemical Improvements and Thermal Control</title>
      <dc:description>Donor&#8211;Acceptor Stenhouse Adducts (DASAs) are playing an outstanding role as innovative and versatile photoswitches. Until now, all the efforts have been spent on modifying donor and acceptor moieties, to modulate the absorption energy and improve the cyclization and reversion kinetics. However, there is a strong dependence on specific structural modifications and a lack of predictive behavior, mostly due to the complex photoswitching mechanism. Here, by means of a combined experimental and theoretical study, we systematically explore the effect of chemical modification of the &#960;&#8208;bridge linking the donor and acceptor moieties, finding significant impact on the absorption, photocyclization and relative stability of the open form. Especially, a position along the &#960;&#8208;bridge is found to be the most suited to red&#8208;shift the absorption while preserving cyclization. However, thermal back&#8208;reaction to the initial isomer is blocked. These effects are explained in terms of an increased acceptor capability offered by the &#960;&#8208;bridge substituent that can be modulated. This strategy opens the path toward derivatives with infra&#8208;red absorption and a potential anchoring point for further functionalization.</dc:description>

      <title>Isolation and Structural Determination of a Hexacoordinated Antimony(V) Dication</title>
      <dc:description>The hexacoordinated antimony(V) dication [(ppy)3Sb]2+  ([1]2+; ppy = 2&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)phenyl), stabilized by three intramolecular donor&#8208;acceptor interactions, was isolated as its hexachloroantimonate salt [1][SbCl6]2, which was prepared by the oxidative addition of chlorine to the neutral stibine (ppy)3Sb (1) followed by the abstraction of chloride. Air&#8208;stable [1][SbCl6]2  also exhibits remarkable thermal stability and the three ppy ligands on the Sb atom are magnetically inequivalent in the  1H and  13C NMR spectra. A hexacoordinated, meridional octahedral bonding geometry was determined for [1][SbCl6]2  by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Theoretical calculations were used to investigate why the meridional form was generated preferentially over the facial form. In addition, the dynamics of the ppy ligands were investigated using variable&#8208;temperature  1H NMR spectroscopy. Other methods to generate dications using a single electron transfer (SET) reagent were also investigated. The structural determination of [1]2+  is the first for a [12&#8211;Sb&#8211;6]2+  chemical species.</dc:description>

      <title>Terpyridine based 3D Metal&#8208;Organic&#8208;Frameworks: A Structure&#8208;Property Correlation</title>
      <dc:description>Design, synthesis, and applications of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are among the most salient fields of research in modern inorganic and materials chemistry. As the structure and physical properties of MOFs are mostly dependent on the organic linkers or ligands, the choice of ligand system always gets importance in the design of MOFs. One such crucial organic linker/ligand is terpyridine (tpy), which can adopt various coordination modes to generate an enormous number of metal&#8208;organic frameworks. These frameworks generally carry physicochemical characteristics induced by the &#960;&#8722;electron&#8208;rich (basically N&#8208;electron rich moiety) terpyridines. In this minireview, we intend to discuss the construction of 3D MOFs associated with symmetrical terpyridines. These ligands could be easily derivatized at the lateral phenyl (4&#697;&#8208;phenyl) position and incorporate additional organic functionalities. These functionalities lead to some different binding modes and form higher dimensional (3D) frameworks. Therefore, these 3D MOFs can carry multiple features along with the characteristics of terpyridines. Some properties of these MOFs, like photophysical, chemical selectivity, photocatalytic degradation, proton conductivity, and magnetism, etc. have also been discussed and correlated with their frameworks.</dc:description>

      <title>Iridium(III) Sensitizers and Energy Upconversion: The Influence of Ligand Structure Upon TTA&#8208;UC Performance</title>
      <dc:description>Six substituted ligands based upon 2&#8208;(naphthalen&#8208;1&#8208;yl)quinoline&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylate and 2&#8208;(naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)quinoline&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylate have been synthesized in two steps from a range of commercially available isatin derivatives. These species are demonstrated to be effective cyclometalating ligands for Ir(III) yielding complexes of the form [Ir(C^N)2(bipy)]PF6 (where C^N = cyclometalating ligand; bipy = 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine). X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies on three examples demonstrate that the complexes adopt a distorted octahedral geometry wherein a cis&#8208;C,C and trans&#8208;N,N coordination mode is observed. Intra&#8208;ligand torsional distortions are evident in all cases. The Ir(III) complexes display photoluminescence in the red part of the visible region (668&#8208;693 nm) which is modestly tuneable via the ligand structure. The triplet lifetimes of the complexes are clearly influenced by the precise structure of the ligand in each case. Supporting computational (DFT) studies suggest that the differences in observed triplet lifetime are likely due to differing admixtures of ligand&#8208;centred versus MLCT character instilled by the facets of the ligand structure. Triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) measurements demonstrate that the complexes based upon the 1&#8208;naphthyl derived ligands are viable photosensitizers with upconversion quantum efficiencies of 1.6&#8208;6.7%.</dc:description>

      <title>A high&#8208;efficiency hematite photoanode with enhanced bonding energy around Fe atoms</title>
      <dc:description>Hematite nanoarray is an important photoanode materials. However, it suffers from serious problems of charge transfer and surface states, especially the surface states hinder the increase of photocurrent. Previous strategy to suppress the surface state is the deposition of Fe&#8208;free metal oxide overlayer. Herein, from the viewpoint of atomic bonding energy, we discover that the strength of bonding around Fe atoms in the hematite is the keypoint to suppress the surface states. By treating the surface of hematite with Se and NaBH  4  , the Fe  2  O  3  transfers to be a double&#8208;layer nanostructure. In the outer layer, the Fe&#8208;O bonding is reinforced and the Fe&#8208;Se bonding is even stronger. Therefore, the surface states are inhibited and the increase of the photocurrent density becomes much faster. Besides, the treatment construct a nanoscale p&#8208;n junction to promote the charge transfer. Improvements are achieved in onset potential (0.25 V shift) and in photocurrent density (5.8 times). This work pinpoints the keypoint to suppress the surface states and prepare high&#8208;efficiency hematite nanoarray, and deepens our understanding of the hematite photoanode.</dc:description>

      <title>Isomers of B&#8592;N&#8208;Fused Dibenzo&#8208;azaacenes: How B&#8592;N Affects Opto&#8208;electronic Properties and Device Behaviors?</title>
      <dc:description>B&#8592;N unit has a large dipole and is isoelectronic to C&#8210;C moiety with no dipole. Incorporating B&#8592;N units to &#960;&#8208;conjugated system is a powerful strategy to design organic small molecules and polymers with intriguing opto&#8208;electronic properties and excellent opto&#8208;electronic device performance. However, it is unclear how B&#8592;N unit affects electronic structures and opto&#8208;electronic properties of large &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules. In this work, to address this question, we develop three dibenzo&#8208;azaacene molecules incorporated with two B&#8592;N units at different positions. Although the dibenzo&#8208;azaacene skeleton is fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated, the effect of B&#8592;N unit on the electronic structures of the adjacent rings is much stronger than that of the distant rings. As a result, the three molecules with isomerized B&#8592;N incorporation patterns possess different electronic structures and exhibit tunable opto&#8208;electronic properties. Among the three molecules, the centrosymmetrical molecule exhibits higher LUMO/HOMO energy levels than those of the two axisymmetrical molecules. When used as the active layer in organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs), while the two axisymmetrical molecules show unipolar electron transporting property, the centrosymmetrical molecule exhibits ambipolar hole and electron transporting behavior. This work not only deepens our understanding on organoboron &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules, but also indicates a new strategy to tune opto&#8208;electronic properties of organic semiconductors for excellent device performance.</dc:description>

      <title>Modulating the electron&#8208;donating ability of acridine donor units for orange&#8208;red thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters</title>
      <dc:description>The development of the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters with orange&#8208;red emission is still lagged behind their blue, green and yellow counterparts. Recent researches to address this problem mainly focused on developing new acceptor units. There were few donor units designed especially for orange&#8208;red emitters. Herein, with the benzothiophene fused to the diphenyl acridine donor unit, a new donor moiety, namely BTDPAc, was designed and synthesized. Benefited from the strong electron&#8208;donating ability of the new donor moiety, a new TADF emitter, BTDPAc&#8208;PhNAI, shows an orange&#8208;red emission with its peak at 610 nm in dilute toluene solution. Also, with the help of the diphenyl rings of the donor unit, high photoluminescence quantum yields (&#934;PL) were achieved for BTDPAc&#8208;PhNAI at a wide concentration range. Consequently, the orange&#8208;red OLED based on BTDPAc&#8208;PhNAI achieved a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of nearly 20%, which is comparable to the state&#8208;of&#8208;art device performances with similar emission spectra.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Adjuvants are key immunostimulatory components in vaccine formulations that improve the immune response to the co&#8208;administered antigen. The saponin natural product QS&#8208;21 is one of the most promising immunoadjuvants in the development of vaccines against cancer and infectious diseases but suffers from limitations that have hampered its widespread human use.

      <title>Emerging Implications of the Concept of Hydricity in Energy&#8208;Relevant Catalytic Processes</title>
      <dc:description>&#8216;Hydricity&#8217; of a species refers to its hydride donor ability. The way the p  K  a  concept is useful to determine the extent of proton transfer, the hydricity concept plays a vital role in understanding hydride transfer reactions. A large number of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed processes involve hydride transfer reaction as a key step. Among these, two key reactions &#8211; proton reduction to evolve&#160;H  2  and hydride transfer to CO  2  to generate formate/formic acid &#8211; represent a promising solution to build a sustainable and fossil fuel&#8208;free energy&#8208;economy. Therefore, it is imperative to develop an in&#8208;depth relationship of hydricity of transition metal hydrides to its influencing factors so that efficient and suitable hydride transfer catalysts can be designed. Moreover, such a profound knowledge can also help in improving the existing catalysts in terms of their efficiency and working mechanism. With this broad aim in mind, some important research works have been explored in this area in recent times. This Minireview emphasizes the conceptual approaches developed thus far to tune and apply the hydricity parameter of transition metal hydrides for efficient H  2  evolution and CO  2  reduction/hydrogenation catalysis focusing on the guiding principles for future research toward this direction.</dc:description>

Among these, two key reactions &#8211; proton reduction to evolve&#160;H  2  and hydride transfer to CO  2  to generate formate/formic acid &#8211; represent a promising solution to build a sustainable and fossil fuel&#8208;free energy&#8208;economy. Therefore, it is imperative to develop an in&#8208;depth relationship of hydricity of transition metal hydrides to its influencing factors so that efficient and suitable hydride transfer catalysts can be designed. Moreover, such a profound knowledge can also help in improving the existing catalysts in terms of their efficiency and working mechanism. With this broad aim in mind, some important research works have been explored in this area in recent times. This Minireview emphasizes the conceptual approaches developed thus far to tune and apply the hydricity parameter of transition metal hydrides for efficient H  2  evolution and CO  2  reduction/hydrogenation catalysis focusing on the guiding principles for future research toward this direction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>1,7,9,10&#8208;tetrasubstituted PMIs accessible via decarboxylative bromination: Synthesis, Characterization, Photophysical Studies and Hydrogen Evolution Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>In this work, we present a new synthetic strategy for fourfold substituted perylene monoimides via tetrabrominated perylene monoanhydrides. X&#8208;Ray diffraction analysis unveiled intramolecular stacking orientation between the substituents and semicircular packing behavior. We observed remarkable influence of the substituent to the longevity and nature of the excited state upon visible light excitation. In the presence of poly(dehydroalanine)&#8208;graft&#8208;poly(ethylene glycol) graft copolymers as solubilizing template, the chromophores are capable of sensitizing [Mo  3  S  13  ]  2&#8208;  clusters in aqueous solution for stable visible light driven hydrogen evolution over three days.</dc:description>

      <title>A Domino Fusion of an Organic ligand Depended on Metal&#8208;Induced and Oxygen Insertion, Unraveled by Crystallography, Mass Spectrometry and DFT Calculation</title>
      <dc:description>Here, we report the reaction, CH  3  CN at 120 &#176;C, of (1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methanamine (  L1  ) with Co(H  2  O)  6  Cl  2  leading to the 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrakis(1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyrazine (  3  ), isolated as a dimeric cluster {[Co  II  2  (  3  )Cl  4  ]&#8729;2CH  3  CN} (  2  ). When O  2  and H  2  O are present, (1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole&#8208;2&#8208;carbonyl)amide (  HL1'  ) is first formed and crystallized as [Co  III  (  L1  )  2  (  L1'  )]Cl  2  &#8729;2H  2  O (  4  ) before fusion of H  L1'  with  L1  giving 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;(1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;carbonyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;carboxamide (  HL2''  ) forming one&#8208;dimensional (1D) chain of [Co  II  3  (  L2''  )  2  Cl  4  ]  n  (  5  ). The combination of crystallography and mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) of isolated crystals and the solutions taken from the reaction as a function time reveal seven intermediate steps leading to  2  , but six steps for  5  which a different sequence takes place. Control and isotope labeling experiments confirm the two carbonyl oxygen atoms in  5  originate from both air and water. The dependence on the metals, compared to FeCl  3  &#183;6H  2  O leading to a stable triheteroarylmethyl radical, is quite astounding, which could be attributed to the different oxidation states of the metals and coordination modes confirmed by DFT calculations. This metal and valence dependent process is a very useful way for selectively obtaining these large molecules which are unachievable by common organic synthesis.</dc:description>
