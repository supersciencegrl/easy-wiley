         <title>Resonance&#8208;Enhanced Emission Effects toward Dual&#8208;State Emissive Bright Red and Near&#8208;infrared Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Resonance&#8208;enhanced emission effect (REE) was discovered and resulted in a novel dye family of hydrostyryl pyridinium derivatives in our recent work. Herein, REE effect was employed to design red and near&#8208;infrared dual&#8208;state emissive fluorophore family of SW&#8208;OH&#8208;NO2s which were further easily synthesized by couple an electron&#8208;withdrawing group (W) onto nitro(hydroxyl)styryl (S&#8208;OH&#8208;NO2) through a C=C double bond as &#960;&#8208;bridge. The deprotonation of phenolic hydroxyl group promoted by nitro group and the electron&#8208;withdrawing group (W) in the other side of &#960;&#8208;bridge triggered resonance and resulting in significantly red&#8208;shifted emission. All the resultant SW&#8208;OH&#8208;NO2s showed excellent dual&#8208;state emission behaviors. Remarkably, hydrostyryl quinolinium (SQ&#8208;OH&#8208;NO2) is one of the smallest NIR emitters molecular skeleton (&#955;em = 725 nm, MW&lt;400) and showed dual&#8208;state emission characteristics and obvious viscosity&#8208;depended fluorescent behaviors. In addition to constructing electron donor&#8208;accepter structure and prolonging &#960;&#8208;bridge, REE effected promised a reliable strategy toward novel fluorophores with small size, long emissive wavelength, and dual&#8208;emission characteristics, and importantly, feasible industrial manufactures and applications due to their easy and low&#8208;cost synthesis strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Allosteric Tuning of Caspase&#8208;7: Establishing the Nexus of Structure and Catalytic Power</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Caspase&#8208;7 (C7), a cysteine protease involved in apoptosis, is a valuable drug target for its role in human diseases (e.g. Parkinson&#8217;s, Alzheimer&#8217;s, sepsis). The C7 allosteric site has great potential for small molecule targeting, but numerous drug discovery efforts have identified precious few allosteric inhibitors. Here we present the first selective, drug&#8208;like inhibitor of C7 along with several other improved inhibitors based on our previous fragment hit. We also provide a rational basis for the impact of allosteric binding on the C7 catalytic cycle using an integrated approach including X&#8208;ray crystallography, stopped&#8208;flow kinetics, and molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings suggest allosteric binding disrupts C7 pre&#8208;acylation via neutralization of the catalytic dyad, displacement of substrate from the oxyanion hole, and altered dynamics of substrate binding loops. This work advances drug targeting efforts and bolsters our understanding of allosteric structure activity relationships (ASARs).</dc:description>

         <title>BAr2&#8208;bridged Azafulvene Dimers with Tunable Energy Levels for Photostable Near&#8208;infrared Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic dyes with strong absorption in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region are potentially useful in medical applications such as tumor imaging and photothermal therapy. In this work, we synthesized new NIR dyes combining BAr2&#8208;bridged azafulvene dimer acceptors with diarylaminothienyl donors in a donor&#8722;acceptor&#8722;donor configuration. Surprisingly, we found that in these molecules the BAr2&#8208;bridged azafulvene acceptor adopts a 5&#8208;membered, rather than 6&#8208;membered ring structure. The influence of the aryl substituents on the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the dye compounds was assessed from electrochemical and optical measurements. Strong electron&#8208;withdrawing fluorinated substituents (Ar = C6F5, 3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3) lowered the HOMO energy while preserving the small HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap, resulting in promising NIR dye molecules that combine strong absorption bands centered around 900 nm with good photostability.</dc:description>

         <title>Excited state processes in supramolecular complexes of cyclic dibenzopyrrolopyrroles isomers with C60 fullerene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An approach to modulating the properties of carbon nanorings by incorporating pyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole units is of particular interest due to the combined effect of heteroatom and antiaromatic character on electronic properties. The inclusion of units other than phenylene leads to the formation of stereoisomers. In this work, we computationally study how the spatial orientation of monomeric units in the ring affects the properties of cyclic dibenzopyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrroles and their complexes with C60 fullerene. For [4]PP and [4]DHPP, the most symmetrical AAAA isomer is the most stable and forms stronger interactions with fullerene than the isomers where one or two monomeric units are flipped, mostly due to less Pauli repulsion. p&#8208;Electron delocalization in the monomeric unit is crucial for directing the electron transfer (from or to nanoring). The energy of charge transfer excited states depends on the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap, which varies from one stereoisomer to another only for [4]DHPP&#8835;C60 with aromatic 1,4&#8208;dihydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole units. The rates of electron transfer and charge recombination reactions are relatively weakly dependent of the spatial isomerism of nanorings.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionic Liquid&#8208;Mediated Approach for the Synthesis of Site&#8208;Specific Thioether Conjugates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioconjugation methodologies have become a central part of therapeutic development. Conjugation of thiol&#8208;containing compounds is now simple with this ionic liquid&#8208;mediated reaction which is site&#8208;specific toward thiol and preserves the stereochemistry. Additionally, Cysteine&#8208;free peptides can be functionalized using the developed technique.







Abstract
Site&#8208;specific conjugation approaches are of great importance in drug discovery, notably for the synthesis of biochemical probes or molecular conjugates for targeted delivery. Herein, we report a mild ionic liquid (IL)&#8208;mediated thiolation technique that relies on the use of 1,3&#8208;ethyl&#8208;methyl imidazolium acetate, [C2mim][OAc] as a solvent and precursor to generate activated IL, as well as a solvent for the conjugation reaction. First, a focused library of active ILs was prepared for functionalizing/conjugating cysteine&#8208;containing small molecules and unprotected peptides. Interestingly, a bifunctional active IL could also be successfully employed as a linker for the conjugation of peptides lacking Cys. This study sets the ground for further investigation of the use of active ILs for modifying, labeling or conjugating larger and more complex therapeutic modalities such as proteins and antibodies.

         <title>Bismuth Cations: Fluoride Ion Abstraction, Isocyanide Coordination, and Impact of Steric Bulk on Lewis Acidity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By the Bi: The bismuth cation [BiDipp2]+, stabilized by an [SbF6]&#8722; counteranion, has been synthesized, isolated and fully characterized (Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3). A detailed comparison with [BiMe2(SbF6)] highlights the impact of steric bulk on bismuth&#8208;based Lewis acidity. Differences in their Lewis acidity have been rationalized, and their reactivity towards [PF6]&#8722; as well as Lewis pair formations have been studied.







Abstract
The molecular compound [BiDipp2(SbF6)], containing the bulky, donor&#8208;free bismuth cation [BiDipp2]+ has been synthesized and fully characterized (Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3). Using its methyl analog [BiMe2(SbF6)] as a second reference point, the impact of steric bulk on bismuth&#8208;based Lewis acidity was investigated in a combined experimental (Gutmann&#8208;Beckett and modified Gutmann&#8208;Beckett methods) and theoretical approach (DFT calculations). Reactivity studies of the bismuth cations towards [PF6]&#8722; and neutral Lewis bases such as isocyanides C&#8801;NR&#8217; revealed facile fluoride ion abstraction and straightforward Lewis pair formation, respectively.

Differences in their Lewis acidity have been rationalized, and their reactivity towards [PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; as well as Lewis pair formations have been studied.

&lt;p&gt;The molecular compound [BiDipp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)], containing the bulky, donor-free bismuth cation [BiDipp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; has been synthesized and fully characterized (Dipp=2,6-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Using its methyl analog [BiMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)] as a second reference point, the impact of steric bulk on bismuth-based Lewis acidity was investigated in a combined experimental (Gutmann-Beckett and modified Gutmann-Beckett methods) and theoretical approach (DFT calculations). Reactivity studies of the bismuth cations towards [PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and neutral Lewis bases such as isocyanides C&#8801;NR&#8217; revealed facile fluoride ion abstraction and straightforward Lewis pair formation, respectively. The first examples of compounds featuring bismuth-bound isocyanides have been isolated and fully characterized.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Shape, Electronic Factors, and the Ferroelectric Nematic Phase: Investigating the Impact of Structural Modifications</title>

Molecular shape and its effects: The synthesis and characterisation of two series of low molar mass mesogens is reported comparing the effect of having a lateral alkoxy chain in the central phenyl ring versus the chain being attached to the methoxy&#8208;substituted terminal ring. Rather than the molecule being required to show a tapered shape, it is the role of the lateral chain in inhibiting anti&#8208;parallel associations that is key.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterisation of two series of low molar mass mesogens, the (4&#8208;nitrophenyl) 2&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;4&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxybenzoyl)oxybenzoates (NT3.m) and the (3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;4&#8208;nitrophenyl) 2&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;4&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxybenzoyl)oxybenzoates (NT3F.m), are reported in order to investigate the effect of changing the position of a lateral alkoxy chain from the methoxy&#8208;substituted terminal ring to the central phenyl ring in these two series of materials based on RM734. All members of the NT3.m series exhibited a conventional nematic phase, N, which preceded the ferroelectric nematic phase, NF, whereas all the members of the NT3F.m series exhibited direct NF&#8208;I transitions except for NT3F.1 which also exhibited an N phase. These materials cannot be described as wedge&#8208;shaped, yet their values of the ferroelectric nematic&#8208;nematic transition temperature, T
, exceed those of the corresponding materials with the lateral alkoxy chain located on the methoxy&#8208;substituted terminal ring. In part, this may be attributed to the effect that changing the position of the lateral alkoxy chain has on the electronic properties of these materials, specifically on the electron density associated with the methoxy&#8208;substituted terminal aromatic ring. The value of TNI decreased with the addition of a fluorine atom ortho to the nitro group in NT3F.1, however, the opposite behaviour was found when the transition temperatures of the NF phase were compared which are higher for the NT3F.m series. This may reflect a change in the polarity and polarizability of the NT3F.m series compared to the NT3.m series. Therefore, it is suggested that, rather than simply promoting a tapered shape, the role of the lateral chain in inhibiting anti&#8208;parallel associations and its effect on the electronic properties of the molecules are the key factors in driving the formation of the NF phase.

         <title>Fluorescence Detection of the Persistent Organic Pollutant Chlordecone in Water at Environmental Concentrations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent cages allow for the detection of the persistent organic pollutant chlordecone in water at environmental concentrations. The reported method is inexpensive, easy to carry out, and of general use for generating many measurements on contaminated water samples. This provides an affordable tool to tackle the major environmental and public health issues associated with chlordecone contamination.







Abstract
Chlordecone (CLD), a Persistent Organic Pollutant, is still present in water and food chain of the French West Indies (FWI), leading to dramatical public health problems. One of the major issues is the lack of an easy, non&#8208;expensive, sensitive and robust method for the detection of chlordecone to ensure chlordecone&#8208;free water and foods for the residents of the FWI. This study reports on the development of a fluorescent molecular cage that allows a simple and convenient detection of chlordecone in water at environmental concentration. The specific structural features of chlordecone prompted the choice of hemicryptophanes as receptor. First, the size, shape of the cavity, as well as the recognition units, were optimized to identify the most efficient non fluorescent host for CLD complexation. Then, this selected compound was equipped with fluorophores at different positions in order to find the most efficient system for CLD detection by fluorescence. Among the two most promising fluorescent cages, the newly synthesized hemicryptophane with biphenyl moieties allowed the development of a fast, easy, reproducible and cheap procedure to detect CLD in water. Based on its sensitivity and scalability, with modulation of hemicryptophane, concentration, CLD concentrations were estimated over five orders of magnitude (10&#8722;2&#8211;103&#8197;&#956;g/L) including the environmental levels of contamination and the permissible limit for drinking water in the FWI.

         <title>Highly Chemoselective Synthesis of Indole Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemoselective electrophilic activation of amides and enols/ketones has been achieved using either Hendrickson reagent in combination with triflic anhydride or triflic acid, which provides an efficient protocol for the divergent synthesis of polysubstituted indoles with flexible substituent patterns from &#945;&#8208;arylamino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;enamides, &#945;&#8208;arylamino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;oxo&#8208;amides or their enol&#8208;keto tautomeric mixture.







Abstract
A facile and efficient synthesis of polysubstituted indoles from &#945;&#8208;arylamino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;enamides, &#945;&#8208;arylamino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;oxo&#8208;amides, or their tautomeric mixture via electrophilic activation strategy is described. The salient feature of this methodology is the use of either combined Hendrickson reagent and triflic anhydride (Tf2O) or triflic acid (TfOH) to control the chemoselectivity in the intramolecular cyclodehydration to provide a predictable approach to these valuable indoles with flexible substituent patterns. Moreover, the mild reaction conditions, simple execution, high chemoselectivity, excellent yields, and wide range of synthetic potential of products make this protocol much attractive for academic research and practical applications.

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered Reversible Open&#8208;Close Motion of a Chiral Molecular Plier to Modulate Guest Binding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light triggered configuration change (azobenzene) of one end of a molecular plier induces an interlocking motion at the other end (porphyrin unit) of the plier accompanied by a pivotal motion around the BINOL axis. E to Z isomerization decreases the distance between two porphyrin units which could be used for selective binding of pyridine&#8208;appended guests. Guest complexation with the plier increases the isomerization efficiency of azobenzene and decreases the thermal back isomerization rate.







Abstract
A chiral molecular plier's design, synthesis, characterisation and operations are presented. The molecular plier encompasses three units: a BINOL unit which acts as a pivot as well as a chiral inducer, an azobenzene unit, which acts as a photo&#8208;switchable component and two zinc porphyrin, acting as a reporter. E to Z isomerisation persuaded by irradiating with 370&#8197;nm light alters the dihedral angle of the pivot BINOL unit, which adjusts the distance between two porphyrin units. The plier can be switched to its initial state by exposure to 456&#8197;nm light or heating at 50&#8201;&#176;C. NMR, CD and molecular modelling supported the reversible switching and change in dihedral angle and distance between reporter moiety, which was further exploited for binding with several ditopic guests. The longest guest was found to form the strongest complex, R,R&#8208;isomer formed a stronger complex than S,S&#8208;isomer, Z&#8208;isomer of the plier formed stronger complex than the E&#8208;isomer with the guest. Moreover, complexation also increased the E&#8208;to&#8208;Z switching efficiency and decreased the thermal back isomerisation of the azobenzene unit.

The longest guest was found to form the strongest complex, &lt;i&gt;R,R&lt;/i&gt;-isomer formed a stronger complex than &lt;i&gt;S,S&lt;/i&gt;-isomer, &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-isomer of the plier formed stronger complex than the &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;-isomer with the guest. Moreover, complexation also increased the &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;-to-&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt; switching efficiency and decreased the thermal back isomerisation of the azobenzene unit.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Umpolung Approach to Acyclic 1,4&#8208;Dicarbonyl Amides via Photoredox&#8208;Generated Carbamoyl Radicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoredox catalysis is used to generate carbamoyl radicals from oxamate salts. Addition to a range of electron&#8208;poor olefins gives the 1,4&#8208;amido&#8208;carbonyl products in good yields. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, and a transition metal or organic photocatalyst can be employed.







Abstract
A method for the generation and reaction of carbamoyl radicals from oxamate salts, followed by reaction with electron&#8208;poor olefins, is described. The oxamate salt acts as a reductive quencher in the photoredox catalytic cycle, allowing mild and mass&#8208;efficient formation of 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl products; a challenging transformation in the context of functionalized amide formation. Increased understanding has been obtained by the use of ab initio calculations, in support of experimental observations. Furthermore, steps have been taken towards an environmentally&#8208;friendly protocol, by utilizing sodium as a cheap and low mass counterion, and demonstrating successful reactions using a metal&#8208;free photocatalyst and a sustainable, non&#8208;toxic solvent system.

         <title>A Cyclodextrin Polymer as Supramolecular Matrix for Scalable Green Photooxygenation of Hydrophobic Substrates in Homogeneous Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromatic endoperoxides were synthesized as O2 releasing agents in organic solvent upon irradiation of a photocatalyst in the presence of the precursors in mM concentration. Co&#8208;encapsulation of both reactants in a cyclodextrin polymer allowed to successfully perform the photocatalyzed oxygenation in homogeneous aqueous environment. Controlled release of O2 could be achieved upon thermolysis.







Abstract
In the quest for new therapies targeting hypoxia, aromatic endoperoxides have intriguing potential as oxygen releasing agents (ORAs) able to free O2 in tissues upon suitable trigger. Four aromatic substrates were synthesized and the formation of their corresponding endoperoxides was optimized in organic solvent upon selective irradiation of Methylene Blue, a low&#8208;cost photocatalyst, producing the reactive singlet oxygen species. Complexation of the hydrophobic substrates within a hydrophilic cyclodextrin (CyD) polymer allowed their photooxygenation in homogeneous aqueous environment using the same optimized protocol upon dissolution in water of the three readily accessible reagents. Notably, reaction rates were comparable in buffered D2O and organic solvent and, for the first time, the photooxygenation of highly hydrophobic substrates was achieved for millimolar solutions in non&#8208;deuterated water. Quantitative conversion of the substrates, straightforward isolation of the endoperoxides and recovery of the polymeric matrix were achieved. Cycloreversion of one ORA to the original aromatic substrate was observed upon thermolysis. These results hold great potential for the launch of CyD polymers both as reaction vessels for green, homogeneous photocatalysis and as carrier for the delivery of ORAs in tissues.

         <title>A Highly Active Cobalt Catalyst for the General and Selective Hydrogenation of Aromatic Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly active cobalt catalyst for the selective hydrogenation of aromatic N&#8208;, O&#8208;, and S&#8208;heterocycles was identified. The key is a simple three component catalyst synthesis permitting to optimize the ratio between N&#8208;doped carbon for embedding and the metal species to be embedded.







Abstract
Nanostructured earth abundant metal catalysts that mediate important chemical reactions with high efficiency and selectivity are of great interest. This study introduces a synthesis protocol for nanostructured earth abundant metal catalysts. Three components, an inexpensive metal precursor, an easy to synthesize N/C precursor, and a porous support material undergo pyrolysis to give the catalyst material in a simple, single synthesis step. By applying this catalyst synthesis, a highly active cobalt catalyst for the general and selective hydrogenation of aromatic heterocycles could be generated. The reaction is important with regard to organic synthesis and hydrogen storage. The mild reaction conditions observed for quinolines permit the selective hydrogenation of numerous classes of N&#8208;, O&#8208; and S&#8208;heterocyclic compounds such as: quinoxalines, pyridines, pyrroles, indoles, isoquinoline, aciridine amine, phenanthroline, benzofuranes, and benzothiophenes.

         <title>Tailoring Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Strategy for Sequence&#8208;Dependent and Thermo/pH Dual&#8208;Responsive Clusteroluminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational design of monomer sequence for desired properties is challenging. This study investigates the effect of monomer distribution of double hydrophilic copolymers (DHCs) with electron&#8208;rich units on cluster triggered emission (CTE) capacity. By means of combining latent monomer strategy, reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization and selective hydrolysis technology, the random, pseudo di&#8208;block and the gradient DHCs consisting of pH&#8208;responsive polyacrylic acid (PAA) segments and thermo&#8208;responsive poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) segments were successfully synthesized in a controlled manner. Moreover, the gradient DHCs showed a tremendously increased luminescent intensity due to the distinct hydrogen&#8208;bonding interaction compared to random and pseudo di&#8208;block DHCs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported the direct correlation between luminescent intensity and sequence structure of non&#8208;conjugated polymer. Meanwhile, thermo and pH dual&#8208;responsive clusteroluminescence could be easily performed. This work demonstrates a novel and facile method to tailor the hydrogen&#8208;bonding for the stimuli&#8208;responsive light&#8208;emitting polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Boronic Acid Assisted Self&#8208;Assembly of Functional RNAs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boronate esters formed by reaction of an oligonucleotide carrying a 5'&#8208;boronic acid moiety with the 3'&#8208;terminal cis&#8208;diol of another have been shown previously to assist assembly of fragmented DNAzymes. Here we demonstrate that boronate esters replacing the natural phosphodiester linkage at selected sites of two functional RNAs, the hairpin ribozyme and the Mango aptamer, allow assembly of functional structures. The hairpin ribozyme, a small naturally occurring RNA that supports the reversible cleavage of appropriate RNA substrates, is very sensitive to fragmentation. Splitting the ribozyme at four different sites led to a significant decrease or even loss of cleavage and ligation activity. Ribozymes assembled from fragments capable of boronate ester formation showed restoration of cleavage activity in some but not all cases, dependent on the split site. Ligation proved to be more challenging, no supportive effect of the boronate ester was observed. Split variants of the Mango aptamer also showed a dramatic loss of functionality, which however, was restored when 5'&#8208;boronic acid modified fragments were used for assembly. These studies show for the first time that boronate esters as internucleoside linkages can act as surrogates of natural phosphodiesters in functional RNA molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Minimizing Product Inhibition in DNA Self&#8208;Replication: Insights for Prebiotic Replication from the Role of the Enzyme in Lesion&#8208;Induced DNA Amplification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;replication of nucleic acids in the absence of enzymes represents an important and poorly understood step in the origin of life as such reported&#160;systems are strongly hindered by product inhibition. Studying one of the few successful examples of enzymatic DNA self&#8208;replication based on a simple ligation chain reaction, lesion&#8208;induced DNA amplification (LIDA), can shed light on how this fundamental process may have originally evolved. To identify the unknown factors that lead LIDA to overcome product inhibition&#160;we have employed isothermal titration calorimetry&#160;and global fitting of time&#8208;dependent ligation data to characterize the individual steps of the amplification process.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Self-replication of nucleic acids in the absence of enzymes represents an important and poorly understood step in the origin of life as such reported&#160;systems are strongly hindered by product inhibition. Studying one of the few successful examples of enzymatic DNA self-replication based on a simple ligation chain reaction, lesion-induced DNA amplification (LIDA), can shed light on how this fundamental process may have originally evolved. To identify the unknown factors that lead LIDA to overcome product inhibition&#160;we have employed isothermal titration calorimetry&#160;and global fitting of time-dependent ligation data to characterize the individual steps of the amplification process.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Stabilized Thiyl Radicals Design Inspired by Elemental Periodic Extension Notion for Ligand&#8208;based Alkene Addition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by alkene addition to the Ru and Re tris(thiolate) complexes via carbon&#8208;sulfur bond formation/cleavage reactions along with a periodic extension catalysis notion, a comparative study of the electronic structures, mechanisms, and reactivities for ethylene addition to the Os and Tc tris(thiolate) complexes was performed by DFT and high&#8208;level ab initio quantum calculations. The oxidized Os and Tc complexes were revealed to exhibit sufficient radical characters on the ligands to support their reaction with ethylene, whereas neutral Tc complex featuring little thiyl radical character renders no reactivity toward ethylene. Differential reactivities of these tris(thiolate) complexes was deemed to derive from the synergy of the thiyl radical character, the electronegativity, the row, and the charge. Extending from Ru and Re tris(thiolate) complexes to their Os and Tc counterparts can help us to get insightful rationales that would promote further research on alkene addition to metal&#8208;stabilized thiyl radicals.</dc:description>

         <title>A Highly Selective and Quantitative Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care Diagnostic Method for Adrenaline</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adrenaline, also known as epinephrine, is a neurotransmitter/hormone that is an important target in diagnostics. Development of&#160;an effective method for detecting it in the presence of other neurotransmitters is a challenging task. The electrochemical and fluorescent techniques commonly used have low selectivity in distinguishing among catecholamines. Herein, we report a small molecule organic probe with an activated furfural moiety to exploit the nucleophilicity of epinephrine to generate a bright&#8208;colored donor&#8208;acceptor Stenhouse adduct. Among nine common&#160;neurotransmitters or their&#160;analogues, only epinephrine was found to generate a unique&#160;colour change&#160;discernible with the naked eye, whereas the other ones remain unaffected. Under various in&#8208;field detection conditions, including solution, droplet, and paper strip&#8208;based detection, the&#160;colour change&#160;were also&#160;noticeable. The low detection limit of 1.37 nM and a limit of quantitation of 4.37 nM were achieved with simple UV&#8208;vis methods in addition to the sub&#8208;ppm level sensing under visual conditions with naked eyes. The probe could be used for practical colorimetric measurements as a point&#8208;of&#8208;care tool without any complex and expensive machinery, making this approach accessible to all. In addition, using a simple smartphone, the determination of epinephrine concentrations is possible using machine&#8208;learning techniques.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered Reversible Swelling of Polymeric Spheres via Surfactant&#8208;Free RAFT Emulsion Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly

Preparation of spherical polymeric particles via surfactant&#8208;free RAFT emulsion polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) with reversible swelling behavior upon UV/Vis light irradiation is described.







Abstract
Responsive photonic crystals (RPCs) assembled by monodisperse colloidal particles have attracted enormous interest recently due to their tremendous applications in smart devices. Their structural colors can be determined by particle sizes. However, the lack of a reliable way to tune the sizes in&#8197;situ limits their development. Herein, we present an efficient route to solve this problem through the fabrication of spherical polymeric particles with light&#8208;triggered reversible swelling behavior via surfactant&#8208;free reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) emulsion polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA). Amphiphilic macro&#8208;RAFT agents containing azobenzene groups were synthesized and subsequently employed to mediate the polymerization of methyl methacrylate. Uniform submicron spheres were obtained by modulating solid contents and other parameters. Benefiting from the photoisomerization of azobenzene moieties, the particle sizes expanded and contracted upon alternative ultraviolet/visible&#8208;light irradiation accordingly. This strategy will be a supplement to the emulsion PISA and especially give aid to the progress of the RPC materials.

         <title>Chemistry, Chemo&#8208;Ecology, and Biological Activities of Uncommon and Structurally Diverse Sesquiterpenoids from the Sanya Bay Nudibranch Hexabranchus sanguineus</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigation of the nudibranch Hexabranchus sanguineus from Sanya Bay afforded thirteen new sesquiterpenoids, of which sanyalactams A and B feature an unprecedented hexahydrospiro[indene&#8208;2,3&#8242;&#8208;pyrrolidine] core. A plausible biogenetic relationship between these sesquiterpenoids is proposed and discussed, and a chemo&#8208;ecological relationship of H. sanguineus and its possible sponge preys is analyzed.







Abstract
A detailed chemical investigation of the Sanya Bay nudibranch Hexabranchus sanguineus yielded thirteen new sesquiterpenoids, namely sanyagunins A&#8722;H, sanyalides A&#8722;C, and sanyalactams A and B, along with eleven known related ones. Sanyalactams A and B feature an unprecedented hexahydrospiro[indene&#8208;2,3&#8242;&#8208;pyrrolidine] core. The structures of new compounds were established by a combination of extensive spectroscopic data analysis, quantum mechanical&#8208;nuclear magnetic resonance methods, the modified Mosher's method, and X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Based on analysis of NOESY correlations and the modified Mosher's method, the stereochemistry of two known furodysinane&#8208;type sesquiterpenoids were revised. A plausible biogenetic relationship between these sesquiterpenoids wasproposed and discussed, and a chemo&#8208;ecological relationship of the title animal and its possible sponge preys has been analyzed. In bioassays, sanyagunin B showed moderate antibacterial activity, whereas 4&#945;&#8208;formamidogorgon&#8208;11&#8208;ene exhibited potent cytotoxicity with IC50 values ranging from 0.87 to 1.95&#8197;&#956;M.

         <title>A Non Expected Alternative Ni(0) Species in the Ni&#8208;Catalytic Aldehyde and Alcohol Arylation Reactions Facilitated by a 1,5&#8208;Diaza&#8208;3,7&#8208;diphosphacyclooctane Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As in cross&#8208;coupling reactions, in the alcohol arylation reaction catalysed by a system combining nickel and a 1,5&#8208;diaza&#8208;3,7&#8208;diphosphacyclooctane ligand, the presence of a Ni(0) intermediate is under debate by Density Functional Theory calculations.







Abstract
For decades there were many attempts to dispense with stoichiometric amounts of metal reagents for the synthesis of secondary alcohols. In 2021, the synthetic results of Newman and collaborators pioneered a synthesis still with metals, but not as reactants. Instead, they serverd as catalytic engines. Here we present a description by means of Density Functional Theory calculations of how this process can occur, and an attempt is made to shed light on the mechanism that facilitates the attainment of secondary alcohols, emphasizing the eternal cross&#8208;coupling debate of whether the catalytically active species is Ni(0) or they are really taking shortcuts following the course of Ni(II). Effective Orbital analyses give a clear picture. Furthermore, this paper provides insight not only into the nature of the ligands of the metal catalyst but also the role of the base.

         <title>Control of Selectivity in Homogeneous Catalysis through Noncovalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selectivity directing mission of noncovalent interactions (hydrogen, halogen, chalcogen, pnictogen and tetrel bonds, as well as agostic and &#960;&#8208;interactions) in homogeneous catalysis is highlighted. The origin of the selectivity in noncovalent catalysis has been investigated through experimental and computational methods.







Abstract
The regio&#8208;, site&#8208;, stereo&#8208; or chemoselective homogeneous catalytic transformations are extremely important for the growth/success of the current chemical industry. Based on empirical, theoretical or intuitive knowledge, several synthetic strategies, such as ligand design, transient directing group, metal node alternation, metal&#8208;ligand cooperation, pore decoration, biomimetic, have already been developed for the selective functionalization of organic substrates. In comparison to the other tactics, the use of noncovalent interactions for the control of selectivity in catalytic transformations of organic compounds may avoid multi&#8208;steps, reduce time of synthetic procedure, decrease cost of operation, and increase reactivity of catalyst. In fact, enzymes achieve a high selectivity through noncovalent interactions in biochemical processes in Nature. Guided by the impressive performance of enzymes in biosynthesis and biodegradation reactions, various types of synthetic metal complex or organocatalysts have already been developed, in which the catalyst&#8208;substrate noncovalent interactions have a pivotal impact on the distinctive stabilization of the transition states or intermediates, directing selectivity and improving efficiency of homogeneous catalytic reactions. Herein, we highlight several recent and relevant examples of selectivity directing/driving function of noncovalent interactions in the transformation of organic substrate(s) catalyzed by both organocatalysts and metal complex catalysts.

         <title>Progress in Predicting Ionic Cocrystal Formation: The Case of Ammonium Nitrate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cocrystal design strategies are rapidly evolving to enhance predictive capabilities and improve the efficiency of coformer screening. However, many of the molecular descriptors associated with successful cocrystallization are ambiguous for salts, complicating coformer selection when designing ionic cocrystals. Herein, a study of ammonium nitrate ionic cocrystals reveals packing coefficient as a promising indicator for coformer success.







Abstract
In contrast to the mature predictive frameworks applied to neutral cocrystals, ionic cocrystals, those including an ion pair, are difficult to design. Furthermore, they are generally excluded categorically from studies which correlate specific molecular properties to cocrystal formation, leaving the prospective ionic cocrystal engineer with few clear avenues to success. Herein ammonium nitrate, an energetic oxidizing salt, is targeted for cocrystallization in a potential coformer group selected based on likely interactions with the nitrate ion as revealed in the Cambridge Structural Database; six novel ionic cocrystals were discovered. Molecular descriptors previously identified as being related to neutral cocrystal formation were examined across the screening group but showed no relationship with ionic cocrystal formation. High packing coefficient is shown to be a constant among the successful coformers in the set and is utilized to directly target two more successful coformers, bypassing the need for a large screening group.

         <title>Supramolecular Interactions&#8208;Assisted Polymorphism and Unique Mechanofluorochromism in 9,10&#8208;Bis((E)&#8208;4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)styryl)anthracene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorinated DSA derivative with two crystalline polymorphs and a nanocrystal were developed to explore the tricolor luminescence switching properties. One of the polymorphs exhibits rarely seen F&#8230;F interactions in its crystalline arrangement. On solvent fuming, the ground polymorphic crystals restored to a much more blue&#8208;shifted thermodynamically stable state, nearly identical to the nanocrystals developed at aggregating conditions.







Abstract
A fluorinated distyrylanthracene (DSA) derivative, 9, 10&#8208;bis((E)&#8208;4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)styryl)anthracene abbreviated as 4FDSA with two crystalline polymorphs (4FDSA&#8208;G (green emission) and 4FDSA&#8208;O (orange emission)), showing remarkable aggregation&#8208;induced enhanced emission and mechanofluorochromic characteristics, was developed. One of the polymorphs in its crystalline arrangement exhibits the hardly seen F&#8230;F interactions. It questions the conventional belief of the non&#8208;polarisable nature of fluorine atoms in forming the halogen bond. The twisted molecular conformation facilitated by the various supramolecular interactions resulted in the formation of another intensely emissive bluer nanocrystal (4FDSA&#8208;NC) at aggregating conditions. Even though, the both polymorphs show distinct tricolor luminescence switching on the action of mechanical force, fumigation of ground crystals with solvent vapor resulted in the formation of a more thermodynamically favorable 4FDSA&#8208;NC form. The work demonstrates the effect of supramolecular interactions assisted conformational changes in tuning the unique mechanofluorochromic characteristics of the polymorphic crystals.

         <dc:description>
The cover shows the oxygen diffusion channel in class&#8197;7 histone demethylase (PHF8) and ethylene&#8208;forming enzyme (EFE). PHF8 catalyzes the hydroxylation of its H3&#8197;K9me2 histone substrate, and EFE catalyzes two competing reactions of ethylene generation and substrate l&#8208;Arg hydroxylation. Although both enzymes initially have an off&#8208;line 2&#8208;oxoglutarate (2OG) conformation, upon oxygen binding, PHF8 forms an in&#8208;line superoxo complex, whereas EFE uses the off&#8208;line superoxo complex. More information can be found in the Research Article by C.&#8197;Z. Christov and co&#8208;workers. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300138).

         <title>Bonding in Low&#8208;Coordinated Organoarsenic and Organoantimony Compounds: A Threshold Photoelectron Spectroscopic Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methyl and methylene compounds of arsenic and antimony are studied by photoelectron photoion coincidence spectroscopy to investigate their relative stability. While for As both HAs=CH2, As&#8208;CH3 and the methylene compound As=CH2 are identified in the spectrum, the only Sb compound observed is Sb&#8208;CH3. Thus, there is a step in the main group 15 between As and Sb, regarding the relative stability of the methyl compounds. Ionization energies, vibrational frequencies and spin&#8208;orbit splittings are determined for the methyl compound from photoion mass&#8208;selected photoelectron spectra. Although the spectroscopic results for organoantimony resemble those for the previously investigated bismuth compounds, EPR spectroscopic experiments indicate for Sb(CH3)3 a far lower tendency for methyl transfer compared to Bi(CH3)3. The present study concludes investigations on low&#8208;valent organopnictogen compounds.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In the field of p&#8208;conjugated nanohoops, the size of the macrocycle has a huge impact on its structural characteristics, which in turn affect its electronic properties. In this work, we report the first experimental investigations linking the size of a nanohoop to its charge transport properties, a key property in organic electronics. We describe the synthesis and the study of the first example of cyclocarbazole possessing five constituting building units, namely [5]&#8209;cyclo&#8208;N&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,7&#8208;carbazole [5]C&#8209;Bu&#8208;Cbz. By comparison with a shorter analogue, [4]&#8209;cyclo&#8208;N&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,7&#8208;carbazole [4]C&#8209;Bu&#8208;Cbz, we detail the photophysical, electrochemical, morphological and charge transport properties, highlighting the key role played by the hoop size. Particularly, we show that the saturated field effect mobility of [5]C&#8209;Bu&#8208;Cbz is four times higher than that of its smaller analogue [4]C&#8209;Bu&#8208;Cbz (4.22 &#215; 10&#8209;5vs 1.04 &#215; 10&#8209;5 cm&#178;.V&#8208;1.s&#8208;1). However, the study of the other OFET characteristics (threshold voltage VTH and subthreshold slope SS) suggest that a small nanohoop is beneficial for a good organization of the molecules in thin films whereas a large one increases the density of structural defects, and hence of traps for the charge carriers. The present findings are of interest for the further development of nanohoops in electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Unique Tubular BiOBr/g&#8208;C3N4 Heterojunction with Efficient Separation of Charge Carriers for Photocatalytic Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The industrial ammonia synthesis process consumes a lot of energy and causes serious environmental pollution. As a sustainable approach for ammonia synthesis, photocatalytic nitrogen reduction employing water as the reducing agent has a lot of potential. A simple surfactant&#8208;assisted solvothermal method is used to synthesize g&#8208;C3N4 nanotubes with flower&#8208;like spherical BiOBr grown inside and outside (BiOBr/g&#8208;C3N4, BC). The hollow tubular structure realizes the full use of visible light by the multi&#8208;scattering effect of light. Large surface areas and more active sites for N2 adsorption and activation are present in the distinctive spatially dispersed hierarchical structures. Particularly, the quick separation and transfer of electrons and holes are facilitated by the sandwich tubular heterojunctions and tight contact interface of BiOBr and g&#8208;C3N4. The maximal NH3 generation rate of the BiOBr/g&#8208;C3N4 composite catalysts can reach 255.04 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1, and it is 13.9 and 5.8 times that of pure BiOBr and g&#8208;C3N4. This work provides a novel method for designing and constructing unique heterojunctions for efficient photocatalytic nitrogen fixation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An efficient domino approach for the synthesis of biologically important 2&#8208;aminoindole derivatives has been developed using CuBr2&#8208;mediated SET oxidative cyclization as a key step. This one&#8208;pot multicomponent strategy utilizes readily available ethyl propiolate, tosyl azide and substituted aryl amines as starting materials. The generality and scope of this mild method are demonstrated with a wide variety of substrates to furnish functionalized 2&#8208;aminoindoles in good yields. The synthetic power of this strategy is further exemplified in the concise synthesis of biologically important alkaloids, Phaitanthrin E and Tryptanthrin.</dc:description>

         <title>Negative Homotropic Cooperativity in Guest Binding of a Trisporphyrin Double Cleft</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The&#160;negative homotropic allostery of a triple&#8208;layered trisporphyrin cleft with two guest binding sites was confirmed. The X&#8208;ray crystal structures of the 1:2 host&#8208;guest complexes showed that the trisporphyrin accommodated two guest molecules within the cleft via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and donor&#8208;acceptor interactions. In solution,&#160;1H NMR and Job plots showed 1:2 host&#8208;guest complexes. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and UV/vis absorption spectroscopy were employed to evaluate the binding constants and cooperativities. The guest binding of the trisporphyrin showed negative cooperativity and noncooperativity depending on the structures of the guest molecules. The correlations between the interaction parameters (&#945;) and Hill constants were determined. ITC experiments showed that the host&#8208;guest complexation of trisporphyrin with electron&#8208;deficient guests incurred an enthalpy penalty in the successive guest binding process. DFT calculations revealed that the first guest binding reduced the electron density of the central porphyrin plane, which led to an energetic penalty that weakened the successive binding process.</dc:description>

Seeing red: A series of cyanine&#8208;borondifluoride curcuminoid hybrids called Nanchang Red (NCR) dyes have been obtained as novel red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR fluorophores with ER self&#8208;targeting capability. Their photoluminescent properties and mechanism have been revealed.







Abstract
Synthesis&#8208;oriented design led us to the discovery of a series of novel cyanine&#8208;borondifluoride curcuminoid hybrids called Nanchang Red (NCR) dyes that overcome the intrinsic low synthetic yields of symmetrical cyanine&#8208;difluoroboronate (BF2)&#8208;hybridized NIR dyes. The hybridization endows NCR dyes with high molar extinction coefficients, efficient red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR emission, and enlarged Stokes shifts. Quantum chemical calculations revealed that the asymmetrical layout of the three key electron&#8208;withdrawing and electron&#8208;donating fragments results in a special pattern of partial charge separation and inconsistent degrees of charge delocalization on their &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbones. While the nature of the hemicyanine fragment exerts significant influence on the excitation modes of NCR dyes, the borondifluoride hemicurcuminoid fragment is the major contributor to the enlarged Stokes shifts. Cell imaging experiments illustrated that a subtle change in the N&#8208;heterocycle of the hemicyanine fragment has a remarkable effect on the subcellular localization of NCR dyes. Unlike other previously reported cyanine&#8208;BF2 hybridized dyes, which mainly target mitochondria, the benzothiazole and indole&#8208;based NCR dyes accumulate in both the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and lipid droplets of HeLa cells, whereas the benzoxazole and quinoline&#8208;based NCR dyes stain the ER specifically.

         <title>Assembling Artificial Photosynthetic Models in Water Using &#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin&#8208;Conjugated Phthalocyanines as Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two water&#8208;soluble zinc(II) phthalocyanines substituted with two or four permethylated &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#160;(&#946;&#8208;CD)&#160;moieties at the &#945; positions&#160;have been utilized as building blocks for the construction of artificial photosynthetic models in water. The hydrophilic and bulky &#946;&#8208;CD moieties not only can increase the water solubility of the phthalocyanine core and prevent its stacking in water but can also bind with a tetrasulfonated zinc(II) porphyrin (ZnTPPS) and/or sodium 2&#8208;anthraquinonesulfonate (AQ) in water through host&#8208;guest interactions. The binding interactions of these species have been studied spectroscopically, while the photoinduced processes of the resulting complexes have been investigated using&#160;steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic methods. In the ternary complexes,&#160;the ZnTPPS units serve as light&#8208;harvesting antennas to capture the light energy and transfer it to the&#160;phthalocyanine core via efficient excitation energy transfer.&#160;The excited phthalocyanine is&#160;subsequently&#160;quenched&#160;by the electron&#8208;deficient&#160;AQ&#160;units&#160;through electron transfer.&#160;Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy provides clear evidence for the singlet&#8208;singlet energy transferfrom the photo&#8208;excited ZnTPPS to&#160;the&#160;phthalocyanine&#160;core with a rate constant (kENT)&#160;in the order of&#160;109&#160;s&#8208;1.&#160;Thepopulation of phthalocyanine radical cations indicates the occurrence of electron transfer from the excited phthalocyanine to the AQ moieties, forming a charge&#8208;separated state.</dc:description>

         <title>A Novel Electrocatalyst Pd(II)@Ni3(HITP)2 for Ultrasensitive Detection of Chloramphenicol: Experimental and Computational Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel electrocatalyst Pd(II)@Ni3(HITP)2 was designed and synthesized for chloramphenicol (CAP) detection. An ultra&#8208;low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.2&#8197;nM was achieved by Pd(II)@Ni3(HITP)2 and its loading mechanism was investigated in theory and experiment.







Abstract
Ultrasensitive electrochemical detection on hazardous substances like antibiotics and pesticides is essential but still challenging in rapid test technology. Herein, the first electrode using highly conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (HCMOFs) for electrochemical detection of chloramphenicol is proposed. The design of electrocatalyst Pd(II)@Ni3(HITP)2 with ultra&#8208;sensitivity in detection of chloramphenicol is demonstrated by loading Pd onto HCMOFs. An ultra&#8208;low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.2&#8197;nM (64.6&#8197;pg/mL) was observed for these materials, which is 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude lower than the other reported materials for chromatographic detection. Moreover, the proposed HCMOFs showed long&#8208;time stability over 24&#8197;h. The superior detection sensitivity can be attributed to the high conductivity of Ni3(HITP)2, and the large Pd loading. The experimental characterizations and computational investigation determined the Pd loading mechanism in Pd(II)@Ni3(HITP)2, revealing PdCl2 adsorption on the abundant adsorption sites of Ni3(HITP)2. The proposed electrochemical sensor design using HCMOFs was demonstrated to be both effective and efficient, showing that the adoption of HCMOFs decorated with other effective electrocatalysts, which combine high conductivity and high catalytic activity, is of great advantage for ultrasensitive detection.

         <title>BODIPY&#8208;Perylene Charge Transfer Compounds; Sensitizers for Triplet&#8208;Triplet Annihilation Up&#8208;conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

BODIPY heterochromophores, unsymmetrically substituted with perylene and/or iodine at the 2 and 6 positions are prepared and investigated as sensitizers for triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation up conversion (TTA&#8208;UC).







Abstract
BODIPY heterochromophores, asymmetrically substituted with perylene and/or iodine at the 2 and 6 positions were prepared and investigated as sensitizers for triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation up conversion (TTA&#8208;UC). Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses show that the torsion angle between BODIPY and perylene units lie between 73.54 and 74.51, though they are not orthogonal. Both compounds show intense, charge transfer absorption and emission profiles, confirmed by resonance Raman spectroscopy and consistent with DFT calculations. The emission quantum yield was solvent dependent but the emission profile remained characteristic of CT transition across all solvents explored. Both BODIPY derivatives were found to be effective sensitizers of TTA&#8208;UC with perylene annihilator in dioxane and DMSO. Intense anti&#8208;Stokes emission was observed, and visible by eye from these solvents. Conversely, no TTA&#8208;UC was observed from the other solvents explored, including from non&#8208;polar solvents such as toluene and hexane that yielded brightest fluorescence from the BODIPY derivatives. In dioxane, the power density plots obtained were strongly consistent with TTA&#8208;UC and the power density threshold, the Ith value (the photon flux at which 50&#8201;% of &#934;TTAUC is achieved), for B2PI was observed to be 2.5x lower than of B2P under optimal conditions, an effect ascribed to the combined influence of spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC) and heavy metal on the triplet state formation for B2PI.

         <title>Mechanism and Origins of Site&#8208;Selectivity of Template&#8208;Directed C&#8722;H Insertion of Quinolines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Not so simple: Modern computational chemistry (DFT on reaction coordinates, extensive conformational searches, multiple means of treating entropy) has been used to probe the mechanism of a complex organometallic reaction &#8211; template&#8208;directed C&#8722;H insertion of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters into quinoline &#8211; providing a deep dive into the origins of site selectivity and demonstrating that previous simple models are not sufficient.







Abstract
The template&#8208;directed C&#8722;H insertion of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters into quinoline was interrogated by using computational quantum chemistry. An energetically viable mechanism for this complex multistep transformation was elucidated, with attention paid throughout to conformational flexibility and alternative ligand binding modes. The selectivity was found to correlate with distortion from a tetrahedral geometry for the carbon atom involved in C&#8722;H insertion, a parameter that can be applied to future template design.

         <title>Synthesis, Stepwise Bromination, and Functionalization of Picene Diimide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel MCI building block: picene diimide (PiDI) was successfully synthesized. The PiDI derivative PiDI&#8208;CN4 exhibited excellent OFET performance with optimal electron mobility of 0.073&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.







Abstract
Materials Synthesis and Processing Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) diimides are indispensable candidates for n&#8208;type organic semiconductors in organic optoelectronic devices. Developing new PAH diimide building blocks are of remarkable significance for material diversity and further advance in organic semiconductors. In this contribution, 4,5,8,9&#8208;picene diimide (PiDI) was designed and synthesized. Controllable stepwise bromination of PiDI were accomplished to afford 13&#8208;monobromo&#8208;, 13,14&#8208;dibromo&#8208;, 2,13,14&#8208;tribromo&#8208; and 2,11,13,14&#8208;tetrabromo&#8208;PiDI. Moreover, cyanation of 2,11,13,14&#8208;tetrabromo&#8208;PiDI gave the corresponding tetracyanated PiDI, which can be utilized as n&#8208;type semiconductor with OFET electron mobility up 0.073&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. This result demonstrates the potential of PiDI as a building block for constructing new high&#8208;performance electronic&#8208;transporting materials.

         <title>Reduction&#8208;triggered Disassembly of Organic Cationic Nanorods Produces a Cysteine Protease Mimic (Miravet et&#8197;al.)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The triggered disassembly of nanorods produces an effective enzyme mimic, a process related to complex biological systems as cyclic AMP&#8208;dependent protein kinase. An insoluble cysteine protease mimic precursor is incorporated into soluble cationic rods in the presence of cationic surfactants. Reduction of the disulfide unit provokes rod disassembly and generation of a cysteine protease mimic, producing an extraordinary acceleration of PNPA hydrolysis.







Abstract
The emergence of catalytic activity associated with a disassembly process is reported, reminiscent of complex biological systems. A cystine derivative with pendant imidazole groups self&#8208;assembles into cationic nanorods in the presence of the cationic surfactants cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) or cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). Disulfide reduction triggers nanorod disassembly and the generation of a simple cysteine protease mimic, which shows a dramatically improved catalytic efficiency in the hydrolysis of p&#8208;nitrophenyl acetate (PNPA).

Disulfide reduction triggers nanorod disassembly and the generation of a simple cysteine protease mimic, which shows a dramatically improved catalytic efficiency in the hydrolysis of &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-nitrophenyl acetate (PNPA).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Intelligent Laser&#8208;Free Photodynamic Therapy Based on Endogenous miRNA&#8208;Amplified CRET Nanoplatform**</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Laser&#8208;free photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising noninvasive therapeutic modality for deep&#8208;seated tumor, yet is constrained by the low efficiency due to the limited stimulation strategies. Herein, a novel miRNA&#8208;responsive laser&#8208;free PDT was developed through metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs)&#8208;mediated chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) nanoplatform. The photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6)&#8208;loaded MOFs were functionalized with hairpin nucleic acids for sensitive responsiveness of tumor biomarker miRNA through catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA), which enabled the amplified assembly of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)&#8208;mimicking hemin/G&#8208;quadruplex DNAzyme on MOFs. Simultaneously, the on&#8208;MOF assembled DNAzymes efficiently catalyzed chemiluminescence reaction to stimulate adjacent Ce6 in the presence of luminol and H2O2, thus allowing the CRET&#8208;mediated Ce6 luminescence and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation for self&#8208;illuminating PDT. The CRET nanoplatform achieved significant malignant cell apoptosis and tumor inhibition effects without external laser irradiation. It is envisioned that the microRNA&#8208;amplified CRET nanoplatform might be a selective and highly efficient antitumor nanomedicine for precise theranostic.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Design of A&#8722;D&#8722;A Electron Acceptors Towards Low Energy Loss for Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 18, March 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron&#8208;vibration coupling is an important factor affecting the energy loss of organic solar cells. Enhancing molecular planarity and rigidity, adopting angular fusion mode, and tuning electron&#8208;deficient core can effectively decrease the electron&#8208;vibration couplings of A&#8722;D&#8722;A electron acceptors to achieve efficient charge generation and low energy loss for organic photovoltaics.







Abstract
Low energy loss is a prerequisite for organic solar cells to achieve high photovoltaic efficiency. Electron&#8208;vibration coupling (i.&#8201;e., intramolecular reorganization energy) plays a crucial role in the photoelectrical conversion and energy loss processes. In this Concept article, we summarize our recent theoretical advances on revealing the energy loss mechanisms at the molecular level of A&#8722;D&#8722;A electron acceptors. We underline the importance of electron&#8208;vibration couplings on reducing the energy loss and describe the effective molecular design strategies towards low energy loss through decreasing the electron&#8208;vibration couplings.

         <title>Ruthenium(II)&#8208;Dithiocarbazates as Anticancer Agents: Synthesis, Solution Behavior, and Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Apoptotic Cell Death</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 18, March 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis, characterization, ruthenium&#8208;assisted oxime to imine transformation, solution/aqueous phase stability, hydrophobicity, DNA interaction, and cytotoxicity studies (cellular localization, and apoptosis) of three new ruthenium(II)&#8208;dithiocarbazate complexes are documented. This report reveals the detailed study of Ru(II) complexes as effective anticancer agents by inducing a mitochondrial&#8208;targeted apoptotic mode of cell death in human cancer cells.







Abstract
The reaction of the Ru(PPh3)3Cl2 with HL1&#8722;3&#8722;OH (&#8722;OH stands for the oxime hydroxyl group; HL1&#8722;OH=diacetylmonoxime&#8208;S&#8208;benzyldithiocarbazonate; HL2&#8722;OH=diacetylmonoxime&#8208;S&#8208;(4&#8208;methyl)benzyldithiocarbazonate; and HL3&#8722;OH=diacetylmonoxime&#8208;S&#8208;(4&#8208;chloro)benzyl&#8208;dithiocarbazonate) gives three new ruthenium complexes [RuII(L1&#8722;3&#8722;H)(PPh3)2Cl] (1&#8211;3) (&#8722;H stands for imine hydrogen) coordinated with dithiocarbazate imine as the final products. All ruthenium(II) complexes (1&#8211;3) have been characterized by elemental (CHNS) analyses, IR, UV&#8208;vis, NMR (1H, 13C, and 31P) spectroscopy, HR&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS spectrometry and also, the structure of 1&#8211;2 was further confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. The solution/aqueous stability, hydrophobicity, DNA interactions, and cell viability studies of 1&#8211;3 against HeLa, HT&#8208;29, and NIH&#8208;3T3&#8197;cell lines were performed. Cell viability results suggested 3 being the most cytotoxic of the series with IC50 6.9&#177;0.2&#8197;&#956;M against HeLa cells. Further, an apoptotic mechanism of cell death was confirmed by cell cycle analysis and Annexin V&#8208;FITC/PI double staining techniques. In this regard, the live cell confocal microscopy results revealed that compounds primarily target the mitochondria against HeLa, and HT&#8208;29&#8197;cell lines. Moreover, these ruthenium complexes elevate the ROS level by inducing mitochondria targeting apoptotic cell death.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Acylation of Pyranosides with Immobilized Oligopeptide Catalysts in Flow</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 18, March 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe the immobilization of oligopeptide catalysts and their use in the site&#8208;selective acetylation of different monosaccharides. The catalysts are easy to synthesize, can easily be reused for several reactions, and are able to perform well in first continuous flow experiments.







Abstract
We report the site&#8208;selective acetylation of partially protected monosaccharides using immobilized oligopeptide catalysts, which are readily accessible via solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. The catalysts are able to invert the intrinsic selectivity, which was determined using N&#8208;methylimidazole, for a variety of pyranosides. We demonstrate that the catalysts are stable for multiple reaction cycles and can be easily reused after separation from the reaction solution. The catalysts can also be used in flow without loss of reactivity and selectivity.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Intermolecular Hydrocarbonation of Styrenes Mediated by NaH/1,10&#8208;Phenanthroline</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 18, March 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free intermolecular coupling strategy was developed, comprising the reaction of halocompounds with styrenes in the presence of NaH and 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, to afford hydrocarbonated products with complete anti&#8208;Markovnikov selectivity. The developed strategy can be applied to a wide range of halocompounds, including aryl and alkyl halides, and shows good functional group tolerance.







Abstract
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free intermolecular coupling reaction of halocompounds with styrenes in the presence of NaH and 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline was developed. This reaction afforded hydrocarbonated products with complete anti&#8208;Markovnikov selectivity. The method allows the use of a wide range of halocompounds, including aryl and alkyl halides, and good functional group tolerance. Detailed mechanistic studies indicated that an anilide anion generated in&#8197;situ by the NaH&#8208;mediated reduction of 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline works as an electron donor and a hydrogen source.

     alt="Transition-Metal-Free Intermolecular Hydrocarbonation of Styrenes Mediated by NaH/1,10-Phenanthroline"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A transition-metal-free intermolecular coupling&lt;/b&gt; strategy was developed, comprising the reaction of halocompounds with styrenes in the presence of NaH and 1,10-phenanthroline, to afford hydrocarbonated products with complete &lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;-Markovnikov selectivity. The developed strategy can be applied to a wide range of halocompounds, including aryl and alkyl halides, and shows good functional group tolerance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A transition-metal-free intermolecular coupling reaction of halocompounds with styrenes in the presence of NaH and 1,10-phenanthroline was developed. This reaction afforded hydrocarbonated products with complete &lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;-Markovnikov selectivity. The method allows the use of a wide range of halocompounds, including aryl and alkyl halides, and good functional group tolerance. Detailed mechanistic studies indicated that an anilide anion generated &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;situ&lt;/i&gt; by the NaH-mediated reduction of 1,10-phenanthroline works as an electron donor and a hydrogen source.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Selective Monomethylation of Amines with CO2/H2 via Ag/Al2O3 as a Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 18, March 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ag/Al2O3 catalytic controllable synthesis of N&#8208;monomethylated amines by using CO2/H2 as C1 source has been demonstrated in a first example. The reactivity of methylated amines was reduced by the heterolytic dissociation of H2 over the catalyst, and hence conversion of various amines to corresponding monomethylated amines was enabled with excellent selectivity.







Abstract
The selective synthesis of monomethylated amines with CO2 is particularly challenging because the formation of tertiary amines is thermodynamically more favorable. Herein, a new strategy for the controllable synthesis of N&#8208;monomethylated amines from primary amines and CO2/H2 is explored. First&#8208;principle calculations reveal that the dissociation of H2 via an heterolytic route reduces the reactivity of methylated amines and thus inhibit successive methylation. In situ DRIFTS proves the process of formation and decomposition of ammonium salt by secondary amine reversible binding with H+ on the Ag/Al2O3 catalyst, thereby reducing its reactivity. Meanwhile, the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step of monomethylation was much lower than that of overmethylation (0.34&#8197;eV vs. 0.58&#8197;eV) means amines monomethylation in preference to successive methylation. Under optimal reaction conditions, a variety of amines were converted to the corresponding monomethylated amines in good to excellent yields, and more than 90&#8201;% yield of product was obtained.

         <title>Photoactive Organo&#8208;Sulfur Polymers for Hydrogen Generation</title>

Elemental sulfur was coupled with alkenes to generate photoactive polymers that can produce hydrogen from water.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of photoactive polymeric organo&#8208;sulfur (POS) materials. These polymers absorb light in the ultraviolet/visible and near&#8208;infrared region of the solar spectrum, and upon irradiation, they reduce water to hydrogen (H2). The decoration of POS materials with nitrile (&#8722;CN) groups is found to be the critical factor for enhanced interactions with the co&#8208;catalyst, Ni2P, leading to greater H2 evolution rates compared to the nitrile&#8208;free POS material.

         <title>In Search of Hosts for Blue OLEDs: Computational Design and Experimental Validation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 18, March 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aid of DFT calculations was implemented for exploring a space search of 780 molecules. The selection process was designed to find material designs with the highest theoretical triplet energy (&gt;2.81&#8197;eV) along with suitable HOMO/LUMO levels to accommodate the chosen blue dopant (FIrpic). The outcome of the virtual screening process and corresponding device performances have provided an adventitious outcome that will help discard poor candidates at the virtual screening step.







Abstract
Considering the difficulties associated with the conventional &#8216;trial and error&#8217; method for a complete analysis of a giant molecular space, we took the aid of computational pathway (DFT) in screening a large space search of 780 (12&#215;13&#215;5) molecules to search for a host for the blue emitter. The selection process was completed in three Tiers with the conditions of highest theoretical triplet energy (&gt;2.81&#8197;eV), aligned HOMO/LUMO levels w.r.t blue dopant (FIrpic), and position of substituents to meet the optimal requirements as host materials. Tier 1 screened twelve different imidazole heterocycle derivatives as base space groups which resulted in the selection of 4,5&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole. Tier 2 process converged the search to mCN&#8208;CZ having the highest triplet energy and appropriate HOMO/LUMO level relative to FIrpic and ETL. Further, the carbazole of mCN&#8208;CZ was replaced with different aromatic hydrocarbons to find the other best compound in terms of triplet energy and HOMO/LUMO. Tier 3 resulted in another promising candidate (mCN&#8208;FL) as possible host materials. The band alignment with guest predicted mCN&#8208;FL and mCN&#8208;CZ to have optimal device performances compared to CZ&#8208;CZ and the experimentally observed device performance was in accordance with virtual screening results when TAPC was utilized as the hole transporter. The device results of mCN&#8208;CZ and mCN&#8208;FL were better than the reference host TCTA. The obtained results thus proved that a virtual screening process will be a useful tool for synthetic chemists in designing task&#8208;specific materials.

         <title>Synthesis of Two Novel Optically Active #&#8208;Shaped Cyclic Tetramers Based on Planar Chiral [2.2]Paracyclophanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 18, March 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optically active #&#8208;shaped cyclic tetramers, in which the p&#8208;arylene&#8208;ethynylenes were stacked at the terminal benzene units, were synthesized. They composed of bis&#8208;(para)&#8208;pseudo&#8208;ortho&#8208; and bis&#8208;(para)&#8208;pseudo&#8208;meta&#8208;tetrasubstituted [2.2]paracyclophanes. Two kinds of #&#8208;shaped cyclic tetramers (parallel&#8208;type and weave&#8208;type) were formed depending on the &#960;&#8208;staked manner. The weave&#8208;typed cyclic tetramer exhibited excellent CPL behavior with high glum and BCPL values.







Abstract
This study reports the synthesis of optically active cyclic tetramers comprising four stacked &#960;&#8208;electron systems from two enantiomerically pure [2.2]paracyclophane compounds (bis&#8208;(para)&#8208;pseudo&#8208;ortho&#8208; and bis&#8208;(para)&#8208;pseudo&#8208;meta&#8208;tetrasubstituted [2.2]paracyclophane compounds). Depending on the combination of the absolute configurations of the planar chiral pseudo&#8208;ortho&#8208; and pseudo&#8208;meta&#8208;[2.2]paracyclophane units, the cyclic tetramers formed either parallel&#8208;#&#8208; or weave&#8208;#&#8208;structures. The optical and chiroptical properties of both structures were investigated experimentally and theoretically. In particular, the weave&#8208;#&#8208;shaped cyclic tetramer exhibited good chiroptical properties and emitted circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with a high anisotropy factor (|glum| value of the order of 10&#8722;3) and a CPL brightness (BCPL) higher than 100.

         <title>Self&#8208;Healable, Malleable, Ecofriendly Recyclable and Robust Polyimine Thermosets Derived from Trifluoromethyl Diphenoxybenzene Backbones</title>

FPIVs films were successfully fabricated and evaluated. Owing to the presence of aromatic monomers and fluorine effect as well as the high cross&#8208;linking density of dynamic imine bonds, FPIVs films not only exhibited superior mechanical properties and self&#8208;healable behavior but also realized closed&#8208;loop recycling.







Abstract
Dynamic covalent chemistry opens up great opportunities for a sustainable society by producing reprocessable networks of polymers and even thermosets. However, achieving the closed&#8208;loop recycling of polymers with high performance remains a grand challenge. The introduction of aromatic monomers and fluorine into covalent adaptable networks is an attractive method to tackle this challenge. Therefore, we present a facile and universal strategy to focus on the design and applications of polyimine vitrimers containing trifluoromethyl diphenoxybenzene backbones in applications of dynamic covalent polymers. In this study, fluorine&#8208;containing polyimine vitrimer networks (FPIVs) were fabricated, and the results revealed that the FPIVs not only exhibited good self&#8208;healability, malleability and processability without the aid of any catalyst, but also possessed decent mechanical strength, superior toughness and thermal stability. We hope that this work could provide a novel pathway for the design of high&#8208;performance polyimine vitrimers by recycling of plastic wastes.

         <title>Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence and Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence in Materials with Imidazo&#8208;pyrazine&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicarbonitrile Acceptors</title>

Seeing red! Strong donor&#8208;acceptor diads based on novel imidazo&#8208;pyrazine&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicarbonitrile (IPDC) electron acceptors exhibit blue to near infrared emission, as well as delayed emission such as thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP). IPDC&#8208;PTZ carrying the electron donor phenothiazine (PTZ) was found to display dual emission, which was studied in detail by photophysical experiments and computational studies.







Abstract
Three donor&#8208;acceptor compounds based on the imidazo&#8208;pyrazine&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicarbonitrile (IPDC) acceptor were synthesized. The IPDC emitters exhibit blue to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission with up to 54&#8201;% photoluminescent quantum yield. 9,9&#8208;Dimethyl&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroacridine (ACR), phenoxazine (POX), and phenothiazine (PTZ) served as electron donors. IPDC&#8208;POX displayed NIR emission in toluene solution, while showing room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence in the solid state. IPDC&#8208;ACR exhibited yellow thermally activated delayed fluorescence. Interestingly, dual&#8208;emissive behavior as well as excitation&#8208;dependent thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) was found for IPDC&#8208;PTZ, arising from the two conformers of phenothiazine derivatives. Overall, this work describes a novel strong electron acceptor from the fusion of imidazole, pyrazine, and nitrile functional groups into one conjugated heterocycle for materials exhibiting NIR emission, TADF, and/or room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP).

         <title>Biomimetic Tweezers for N&#8208;Glycans: Selective Recognition of the Core GlcNAc2 Disaccharide of the Sialylglycopeptide SGP</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 18, March 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular chemistry meets glycans: Taking advantage of a tweezers&#8208;shaped structure, a biomimetic receptor selectively recognizes the GlcNAc2 disaccharide core of a complex N&#8208;glycan with a remarkable affinity of 170&#8197;&#956;M. Because of the simple structure of the receptor and the ubiquity of the highly conserved GlcNAc2 disaccharide core in N&#8208;glycans, the receptor can be a versatile supramolecular tool for glycosciences.







Abstract
In recent years, glycomics have shown how pervasive the role of carbohydrates in biological systems is and how chemical tools are essential to investigate glycan function and modulate carbohydrate&#8208;mediated processes. Biomimetic receptors for carbohydrates can carry out this task but, although significant affinities and selectivities toward simple saccharides have been achieved, targeting complex glycoconjugates remains a goal yet unattained. In this work we report the unprecedented recognition of a complex biantennary sialylglycopeptide (SGP) by a tweezers&#8208;shaped biomimetic receptor, which selectively binds to the core GlcNAc2 disaccharide of the N&#8208;glycan with an affinity of 170&#8197;&#956;M. Because of the simple structure and the remarkable binding ability, this biomimetic receptor can represent a versatile tool for glycoscience, opening the way to useful applications.

         <title>Templating Influence of Regulated Inorganic Framework in Two&#8208;Dimensional Ferroelastic Perovskites: (C3H5CH2NH3)2[MCl4] (M=Mn and Cd)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 18, March 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new two&#8208;dimensional hybrid perovskites (C3H5CH2NH3)2MnCl4 and (C3H5CH2NH3)2CdCl4 experience reversible ferroelastic phase transitions with Aizu notation of 4/mmmFmmm. Upon substitution of metal center Mn with Cd in the inorganic frameworks, the phase transition temperature is successfully increased while the ferroelastic property is well maintained.







Abstract
The remarkable material stability and structural diversity of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) constitute a vast available library of versatile materials. In particular, ferroelastic property, for which the spontaneous strain can be transformed by applying mechanical stress, is very promising for extensive nanotechnological applications. However, integrating ferroelastic property into 2D OIHPs is still in its infancy. Herein, we designed two new 2D OIHPs (C3H5CH2NH3)2[MCl4] (M=Mn for 1 and Cd for 2), which undergo reversible ferroelastic phase transitions with an Aizu expression 4/mmmFmmm. The templating influence of the more distorted inorganic framework on the disordering of organic cations and the stronger hydrogen bonds has a key role in the striking improvement of Curie temperature from 246&#8197;K in 1 to 273&#8197;K in 2. Meanwhile, the minimized alteration of structural motif ensures the well maintaining of the ferroelastic performance in the forms of crystals and thin films, as demonstrated by the identifiable evolution of domain structures. This work will provide a fertile new ground for enlarging the limited number of 2D ferroelastic OIHPs with better practical utility.

         <title>Synthesis and Structure&#8208;Property Relationships in Regioisomeric Alternating Borane&#8208;Terthiophene Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 18, March 28, 2023. </description>

Borane polymers: Using robust dithienylborane monomers, a series of alternating terthiophene&#8208;borane polymers are obtained by Stille coupling polymerization methods. Variations in the attachment point of boron on the terthiophene linker and the electronic structure of the pendent aryl (Ar) moiety give rise to luminescent materials with divergent optical and electronic properties.







Abstract
Main&#8208;chain boron&#8208;containing &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers are attractive for organic electronic, sensing, and imaging applications. Alternating terthiophene&#8208;borane polymers were prepared and the effects of regioisomeric attachment of the conjugated linker and variations in the electronic effect of the pendent aryl groups (2,4,6&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl, Mes*; 2,4,6&#8208;tris(trifluoromethyl)phenyl, FMes) examined. Pd2dba3/P(t&#8208;Bu)3&#8208;catalyzed Stille polymerization of arylbis(2&#8208;thienyl)borane and arylbis(3&#8208;thienylborane) with 2,5&#8208;bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene at 120&#8201;&#176;C gave polymers with appreciable molecular weight but MALDI&#8208;TOF MS analyses showed evidence of unusually prominent homocoupling. These defects could be suppressed by using brominated rather than iodinated monomers, more hindered 2,5&#8208;bis(tri&#8208;n&#8208;butylstannyl)thiophene as comonomer, and Pd2dba3/P(o&#8208;tol)3 as the catalyst at 100&#8201;&#176;C. Under these conditions, macrocyclic species with n=3&#8211;10 repeating units formed preferentially according to MALDI&#8208;TOF MS analyses. Photophysical studies revealed a prominent effect of the regiochemistry and the nature of the pendent aryl groups on the absorption and emission, giving rise to orange, yellow&#8208;green, blue&#8208;green, and blue emissive materials respectively. The electronic effects were rationalized through DFT calculations on bis(terthiophene) model systems.

         <title>A Molecular Insight into the Dehydration of a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework and its Impact on the CO2 Capture</title>

MD simulations were used to investigate the reasons for CALF&#8208;37&#8242;s resistance to water, as well as its uptake capacity and selectivity to CO2 vs. N2.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous material formed by the self&#8208;assembly of metallic ligands and organic linkers. They are a good candidate for CO2 gas capture because they have large surface areas and the metal or linker can be tuned to improve CO2 uptake. In the quest for water and acid stable MOFs, a phosphonate&#8208;based organic linker has recently been designed by Glavinovic et&#8197;al. (Chem. Eur. J. 2022, 28, e202200874). By combining ionic calcium nodes, water and methanol molecules, they formed a microporous network, CALF&#8208;37. This network has been shown to be robust and can maintain its pore shape even in absence of water molecules or by the inclusion of gas molecules, such as CO2. The network can be heated to release the water and methanol molecules and form a dehydrated MOF, which retains its shape with the imprinted pore within. Herein, we perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in order to provide insight into the CO2 capture and sequestration ability of the CALF&#8208;37. We model the dehydration of the inactivated MOF (HCALF&#8208;37) in the absence and in the presence of methanol molecules by progressively withdrawing water molecules from the MOF networks. We determine the crystal structure of the intermediate states from HCALF&#8208;37 to CALF&#8208;37 and shed light on the critical role of water molecules in the mediation of metal&#8208;linker bonds. Our calculations also reveal that the favorable interactions between the CO2 molecules and the aromatic core of the linkers and metallic ions are responsible for the efficient sequestration of the gas in the CALF&#8208;37.

         <title>Liquid Dynamics Determine Transition Metal&#8208;N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Complex Formation</title>

Getting beyond first base: To choose the best base in NHC complex syntheses, considerations beyond pKa values are necessary. The high activity of ionic bases can be explained through their affinity to form ion pairs with the substrate imidazolium cation, allowing for a more frequent interaction with the acidic site of the ring.







Abstract
The mechanism of metal&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complex formation from imidazolium salts in the presence of weak bases was investigated through theoretical methods. Quantum chemical calculations revealed that the two bases considered here, sodium acetate and trimethylamine, both facilitate complex formation. In contrast to previous experiments, these calculations indicated a slightly lower barrier with the amine. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that the ionic nature of the [AuCl2]&#8722; and imidazolium ions, as well as the sodium acetate base keep these species associated in the reaction mixture through ion pairing. This pre&#8208;association of the components produces those clusters that are essential for the metal complex formation reaction. The neutral amine, however, remains mostly separated from the other reaction partners, making it a significantly less effective base.

Nanoncapsulation of E. coli by tannic acid (TA)&#8208;Fe complexes enhances its stability in seawater. Further, different types of nanomaterials can be easily introduced to the surface of E. coli using TA&#8722;Fe shells as a biological interface. The E. coli&#8208;based semiconductor biohybrid system prepared by nanoencapsulation and hybridisation can significantly enhance hydrogen production activity under illumination and shows good stability in seawater.







Abstract
CdS nanoparticles were introduced on E. coli cells to construct a hydrogen generating biohybrid system via the biointerface of tannic acid&#8208;Fe complex. This hybrid system promotes good biological activity in a high salinity environment. Under light illumination, the as&#8208;synthesized biohybrid system achieves a 32.44&#8201;% enhancement of hydrogen production in seawater through a synergistic effect.

         <title>Large&#8208;Area Uniaxially Oriented Sub&#8208;5&#8197;nm Line Patterns of Hybrid Liquid Crystals Constructed by Perylene Diimide and Oligo(Dimethylsiloxane)</title>

Perylene diimide&#8208;based disc&#8208;coil liquid crystals containing oligo(dimethylsiloxane) chains can form lamellar and columnar phases, and large&#8208;area uniaxially orientated nanolines can be obtained through thin&#8208;film self&#8208;assembly.







Abstract
Construction of sub&#8208;5&#8197;nm long&#8208;range ordered structures through self&#8208;assembly has received increasing attention. Herein, a series of ODMS&#8208;based thermotropic liquid crystals (LCs) containing perylene diimide (PDI) were designed and synthesized. These LCs can form ordered nanostructures with periodic sizes around 5&#8197;nm including smectic J (SmJ), oblique columnar (Colob), and hexagonal columnar (Colh) phases with change in the volume fraction of ODMS, where the layer spacing of the SmJ phase is less than 5&#8197;nm. Thin films with parallel oriented nanolines with line width less than 5&#8197;nm can be obtained on PDMS&#8208;modified silicon substrates by spin&#8208;casting and simple thermal annealing processes. Moreover, owing to the strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction between PDI cores, these nanolines are long&#8208;range ordered with uniaxial orientation in relatively large areas (1.5&#215;1.5&#8197;&#956;m2) with over 300 continuous microdomains without pre&#8208;patterning. These nanostructures provide the possibility of preparing nanotemplates by oxygen plasma etching.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Perylene diimide-based disc-coil liquid crystals&lt;/b&gt; containing oligo(dimethylsiloxane) chains can form lamellar and columnar phases, and large-area uniaxially orientated nanolines can be obtained through thin-film self-assembly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Construction of sub-5&#8197;nm long-range ordered structures through self-assembly has received increasing attention. Herein, a series of ODMS-based thermotropic liquid crystals (LCs) containing perylene diimide (PDI) were designed and synthesized. These LCs can form ordered nanostructures with periodic sizes around 5&#8197;nm including smectic J (SmJ), oblique columnar (Col&lt;sub&gt;ob&lt;/sub&gt;), and hexagonal columnar (Col&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;) phases with change in the volume fraction of ODMS, where the layer spacing of the SmJ phase is less than 5&#8197;nm. Thin films with parallel oriented nanolines with line width less than 5&#8197;nm can be obtained on PDMS-modified silicon substrates by spin-casting and simple thermal annealing processes. Moreover, owing to the strong &#960;-&#960; interaction between PDI cores, these nanolines are long-range ordered with uniaxial orientation in relatively large areas (1.5&#215;1.5&#8197;&#956;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) with over 300 continuous microdomains without pre-patterning. These nanostructures provide the possibility of preparing nanotemplates by oxygen plasma etching.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Donor&#8208;Acceptor Tribenzotriquinacene&#8208;Based Molecular Wizard Hats Bearing Three ortho&#8208;Benzoquinone Units</title>

The warped polyaromatic compounds 12 and 16 were synthesized via complementarily functionalized TBTQ&#8208;based dodecaethers. Congener 12, representing an 18&#960;&#8208;electron push&#8208;pull system, exhibits a much more bathochromic absorption in the visible than 16, which bears three cross&#8208;conjugated push&#8208;pull &#960;&#8208;systems. Structural features obtained by X&#8208;ray diffraction agree with this striking difference.







Abstract
Two &#960;&#8208;extended bay&#8208;bridged tribenzotriquinacenes (&#8220;TBTQ wizard hats&#8221;) 12 and 16 bearing three mutually conjugated, alternating veratrole&#8208;type and ortho&#8208;benzoquinone units were synthesized. The electronic properties of these complementarily arranged, nonplanar push&#8208;pull systems are affected by the fusion with the rigid, C3&#8208;symmetric TBTQ core to a different extent, as revealed by X&#8208;ray structural analysis, UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy and cyclovoltammetry. The combination of three quinone units within the original TBTQ core and three veratrole&#8208;type bay bridging units in 12 gives rise to a more efficiently &#960;&#8208;conjugated chromophore, as reflected by the shallower shape of wizard hat and its absorption in the visible up to 750&#8197;nm in comparison to 16. Congener 12 contains an aromatic 18&#8208;&#960; electron system in contrast to the cross&#8208;conjugated analog 16. X&#8208;ray structure analysis of the precursor dodecaether 15 revealed the formation of a cage&#8208;like supramolecular dimer, in which the peripheral dioxane&#8208;type ether groups interlace by twelve noncovalent C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O bonds.

         <title>Enantioselective [3+2] Cycloaddition of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Aziridines and Imines to Construct 2,5&#8208;trans&#8208;Imidazolidines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 18, March 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric [3+2] annulation to synthesize imidazolidine compounds with 2,2&#8217;&#8208;diester aziridines and imines was reported. A series of chiral trans&#8208;imidazolidines were obtained in high yields with outstanding enantioselectivities under mild reaction conditions. Compared to the previously reported method of synthesizing imidazolines, this method could offer the imidazoline compounds with 2,5&#8208;trans&#8208;selectivity. The stereoselectivities of the products were determined by the metal/N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide and the interaction of substrates as suggested by control experiments.







Abstract
An enantioselective [3+2] cycloaddition of donor&#8208;acceptor aziridines with N&#8208;aryl protected imines was developed with a Ni(ClO4)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6H2O/N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide catalyst system, providing a broad range of chiral trans&#8208;substituted imidazolidine compounds with good yields and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% yield, up to 98&#8201;% ee). Control experiments indicated that the products could offer excellent diastereoselectivities with the control of chiral Ni(II)&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide complex and the interaction of the substrates. The possible catalytic process was proposed to rationalize the stereocontrol.

A novel stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescent material platform is based on an evocation of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) from tetraphenylethylene (TPE)&#8208;functionalized surfactants in response to a trigger&#8208;induced decrease in the selective surfactant&#8208;functionalized liquid&#8211;liquid interface area of reconfigurable biphasic Janus emulsions.







Abstract
We report a novel stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescent material platform that relies on an evocation of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) from tetraphenylethylene (TPE)&#8208;based surfactants localized at one hemisphere of biphasic micro&#8208;scale Janus emulsion droplets. Dynamic alterations in the available interfacial area were evoked through surfactant&#8208;induced dynamic changes of the internal droplet morphology that can be modulated as a function of the balance of interfacial tensions of the droplet constituent phases. Thus, by analogy with a Langmuir&#8211;Blodgett trough that enables selective concentration of surfactants at a liquid&#8211;gas interface, we demonstrate here a method for controllable modulation of the available interfacial area of surfactant&#8208;functionalized liquid&#8211;liquid interfaces. We show that a morphology&#8208;dependent alteration of the interfacial area can be used to evoke an optical signal, by selectively assembling synthesized TPE&#8208;based surfactants on the respective droplet interfaces. A trigger&#8208;induced increase in the concentration of TPE&#8208;based surfactants at the liquid&#8211;liquid interfaces results in an evocation of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), inducing an up to 3.9&#8208;fold increase in the measured emission intensity of the droplets.

         <title>Stirring&#8208;Free Scalable Electrosynthesis Enabled by Alternating Current</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 18, March 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of alternating current enables the concept of a stirring&#8208;free batch reactor, where the periodic switch of electrode polarity provides uniform electrolysis throughout the reactor volume. The AC&#8208;derived design implies a straightforward approach for scaling up electrosynthesis from parallel screening experiments to large&#8208;scale preparative electrolysis.







Abstract
Alternating current (AC) electrolysis is receiving increased interest as a versatile tool for mild and selective electrochemical transformations. This work demonstrates that AC can enable the concept of a stirring&#8208;free electrochemical reactor where the periodic switch of electrode polarity, inherent to AC, provides uniform electrolysis across the whole volume of the reactor. Such design implies a straightforward approach for scaling up electrosynthesis. This was demonstrated on the range of electrochemical transformations performed in three different RVC&#8208;packed reactors on up to a 50&#8208;mmol scale. Redox&#8208;neutral, oxidative, and reductive processes were successfully implemented using the suggested design and the applicable frequency ranges were further investigated for different types of reactions. The advantages of the AC&#8208;enabled design &#8211; such as the absence of stirring and a maximized surface area of the electrodes &#8211; provide the possibility for its universal application both for small&#8208;scale screening experimentation and large&#8208;scale preparative electrosynthesis without significant optimization needed in between.

         <title>Non&#8208;Fullerene Electron Acceptors Based on Hybridisation of Corannulene and Thiophene&#8208;S,S&#8208;Dioxide Motifs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 18, March 28, 2023. </description>

Non&#8208;fullerene electron acceptors: A combination of the bowl&#8208;shaped corannulene and thiophene&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxides motifs is shown to be a strong molecular design in the preparation of non&#8208;fullerene electron acceptors.







Abstract
Herein we show that hybridisation of buckybowl corannulene and thiophene&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide motifs is a general approach for the preparation of high electron affinity molecular materials. The devised synthesis is modular and relies on thienannulation of corannnulene&#8208;based phenylacetylene scaffolds. The final compounds are highly soluble in common organic solvents. These compounds also exhibit interesting optical properties such as absorption and emission in the blue/green regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Importantly, a bis&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide derivative exhibits three reversible reductions similar in their strength to the prevalent fullerene&#8208;based electron acceptor phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM).

         <title>5&#8208;(Trifluorovinyl)dibenzothiophenium Triflate: Introducing the 1,1,2&#8208;Trifluoroethylene Tether in Drug&#8208;Like Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 18, March 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A key reagent to introduce trifluoroethylene: A protocol for the connection of alcohols and (hetero)arenes via a trifluoroethylene linker has been developed. Key for the development of this procedure has been the synthesis of a sulfonium salt bearing a trifluorovinyl substituent. This reagent suffers the addition of alcohols to the activated double bond and subsequently generates alkyl fluoride radicals by mesolytic cleavage of the S&#8722;C bond after one electron reduction.







Abstract
This manuscript reports the synthesis and structure of an unprecedented sulfonium salt, 5&#8208;(trifluorovinyl)dibenzothiophenium triflate, and its use as a versatile reagent for the introduction of the bioisosteric 1,1,2&#8208;trifluoroethylene linker in drug&#8208;like structures. The protocol developed consists of the reaction of this compound with alcohols and phenols to deliver a complete set of 1,2,2&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;2&#8208;(alkoxy&#8208;/aryloxy)ethyl sulfonium salts, which have been purified by column chromatography and fully characterized. Subsequent single electron reduction under mild photochemical conditions efficiently affords the corresponding fluoroalkyl radicals that are trapped either intra&#8208; or intermolecularly through their reaction with (hetero)arenes. Theoretical calculations are used to evaluate the conformational consequences derived from the presence of the CF2&#8722;CHF tether.

         <title>Mechanoresponsive Metal&#8208;Organic Cage&#8208;Crosslinked Polymer Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 18, March 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The utilization of homobifunctional poly(ethylene glycol) chains terminally substituted with bipyridines as ligands for Pd6L4 cages enabled crosslinking of the metal&#8208;organic cages and subsequent network formation, leading to supramolecular polymer hydrogels. The hydrogels allow for non&#8208;covalent guest uptake and release using ultrasound from aqueous solution.







Abstract
We report the formation of metal&#8208;organic cage&#8208;crosslinked polymer hydrogels. To enable crosslinking of the cages and subsequent network formation, we used homodifunctionalized poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chains terminally substituted with bipyridines as ligands for the Pd6L4 corners. The encapsulation of guest molecules into supramolecular self&#8208;assembled metal&#8208;organic cage&#8208;crosslinked hydrogels, as well as ultrasound&#8208;induced disassembly of the cages with release of their cargo, is presented in addition to their characterization by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques, rheology, and comprehensive small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) experiments. The constrained geometries simulating external force (CoGEF) method and barriers using a force&#8208;modified potential energy surface (FMPES) suggest that the cage&#8208;opening mechanism starts with the dissociation of one pyridine ligand at around 0.5&#8197;nN. We show the efficient sonochemical activation of the hydrogels HG3&#8211;6, increasing the non&#8208;covalent guest&#8208;loading of completely unmodified drugs available for release by a factor of ten in comparison to non&#8208;crosslinked, star&#8208;shaped assemblies in solution.

Total syntheses of geissoschizine&#8208;type monoterpenoid indole alkaloids (MTIAs) are reported. An intramolecular Pictet&#8208;Spengler cyclization was developed for the selective construction of the 3R stereocenter. The first total synthesis of (+)&#8208;villocarine&#8197;A was then achieved. Furthermore, the first total synthesis of the highly strained (&#8722;)&#8208;apogeissoschizine was also accomplished in an aza&#8208;Michael cyclization/E1cB elimination/stereoselective olefin isomerization sequence.

         <title>Cooperative Friedel&#8211;Crafts Alkylation of Electron&#8208;Deficient Arenes via Catalyst Activation with Hexafluoroisopropanol
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 18, March 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report the challenging and scantily explored Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation of electron&#8208;deficient arenes using a &#8220;catalyst activation&#8221; approach. Through strong hydrogen bonding with solvent hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) the Br&#248;nsted acidity of the catalyst is increased which stabilizes the transition states of the Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction via concerted mechanism.

A Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation of electron&#8208;deficient arenes with aldehydes through &#8242;&#8242;catalyst activation&#8242;&#8242; is presented. Through hydrogen bonding interactions, the solvent 1,1,1,3,3,3, &#8208;hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) interacted with the added Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst pTSA&#8226;H2O, increasing its acidity. This activated catalyst enabled the Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation of electron&#8208;neutral as well as electron&#8208;deficient arenes. Strongly electron withdrawing arenes including arenes with multiple halogen atoms, NO2, CHO, CO2R, and CN, groups acted as efficient nucleophiles in this reaction. DFT studies reveal multiple roles of solvent HFIP viz; increasing the Br&#248;nsted acidity of the catalyst pTSA&#8226;H2O, and stabilization of the transition states through a concerted pathway enabling the challenging reaction.

&lt;p&gt;Herein, we report the challenging and scantily explored Friedel-Crafts alkylation of electron-deficient arenes using a &#8220;catalyst activation&#8221; approach. Through strong hydrogen bonding with solvent hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) the Br&#248;nsted acidity of the catalyst is increased which stabilizes the transition states of the Friedel-Crafts reaction via concerted mechanism.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Friedel-Crafts alkylation of electron-deficient arenes with aldehydes through &#8242;&#8242;catalyst activation&#8242;&#8242; is presented. Through hydrogen bonding interactions, the solvent 1,1,1,3,3,3, -hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) interacted with the added Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;TSA&#8226;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, increasing its acidity. This activated catalyst enabled the Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation of electron-neutral as well as electron-deficient arenes.

To form an ion pair with an imidazolium cation, the base must first &#8220;find&#8221; the substrate, like a pirate who is searching for treasure. The treasure is the acidic proton of the imidazolium cation which will need to be abstracted by the base. The ionic base can effectively approach the cation, while the non&#8208;ionic one wanders off. More information can be found in the Research Article by O. Holl&#243;czki and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203636).

Geissoschizine is a very important biosynthetic intermediate of monoterpenoid alkaloids in higher plants. In this study, the enantioselective and stereodivergent total syntheses of geissoschizine and two related indole alkaloids (villocarine&#8197;A and apogeissoschizine) were achieved. The three synthesized natural products are represented as Nishikigoi (varicolored carp), which are also called &#8220;swimming jewels&#8221; in Japan, and the cascade reaction is represented by their graceful swimming along a river. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Ishikawa and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300179).

Stimuli&#8208;triggered alterations in biphasic Janus emulsion droplet morphologies enable controllable modulation of the area of surfactant&#8208;functionalized liquid&#8211;liquid interfaces. This effect can be used to induce aggregation&#8208;induced emission from tetraphenylethylene&#8208;functionalized surfactants, yielding a novel stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescent material platform. Here, TPE aggregation and emission on an interface are shown in front of a fluorescence micrograph of the actual system. More information can be found in the Research Article by L. Zeininger and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203790).

         <title>Tetrelanes versus Tetrylenes as Precursors to Transition Metal Complexes Featuring Tridentate PEP Tetryl Ligands (E=Si, Ge, Sn)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 18, March 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
PEP ligands: Two general synthetic approaches to the synthesis of tridentate PEP tetryl (E=Si, Ge, Sn) metal complexes are presented as a function of the metal&#8208;free precursor, tetrelane or tetrylene, that gives rise to the final PEP tetryl ligand. For each approach, all the currently known types of PEP tetryl ligand frameworks that have been found in their corresponding complexes are presented and discussed.







Abstract
Two synthetic approaches have until now been used to synthesize transition metal complexes having a tridentate (pincer or tripod) PEP tetryl (E=Si, Ge, Sn) ligand. These approaches differ in the metal&#8208;free precursor, tetrelane or tetrylene, that gives rise to the corresponding PEP tetryl ligand. Tetrelanes (PSiP silanes, PGeP germanes and PSnP stannanes and simple phosphane&#8208;free stannanes) have led to tetryl ligands by oxidatively adding an E&#8722;X bond (X=H, C or halogen in most cases) to the metal atom of a low&#8208;valent transition metal complex, whereas tetrylenes (PGeP germylenes and PSnP stannylenes) have led to tetryl ligands upon insertion of their E atom into an M&#8722;X bond (X=Cl in most cases) of the metal precursor or through a derivatization of the E atom after the tetrylene fragment is coordinated to the metal. For each synthetic approach, all the currently known types of PEP tetryl ligand frameworks that have been found in transition metal complexes are presented and discussed in this review.

         <title>Activity Sensing of Coagulation and Fibrinolytic Proteases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 18, March 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the essential proteases involved in blood coagulation and fibrinolysis, the endogenous peptide sequences they recognize and hydrolyze, and synthetic activity&#8208;based peptide probes based on these sequences to measure their activity. The existing strategies summarized in this review could contribute to the challenges ahead in the field of coagulation and fibrinolytic monitoring, especially for point&#8208;of&#8208;care applications.







Abstract
The blood coagulation cascade is a complex physiological process involving the action of multiple coupled enzymes, cofactors, and substrates, ultimately leading to clot formation. Serine proteases have a crucial role, and aberrations in their activity can lead to life&#8208;threatening bleeding disorders and thrombosis. This review summarizes the essential proteases involved in blood coagulation and fibrinolysis, the endogenous peptide sequences they recognize and hydrolyze, and synthetic peptide probes based on these sequences to measure their activity. The information in this review can contribute to developing novel anticoagulant therapies and specific substrates for point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnosis of coagulation pathologies.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the increasing demand for renewable energy, alkali metal&#8208;ion (lithium/sodium/potassium&#8208;ion) batteries play more and more important roles in the field of static storage and electrical vehicle industry. Novel anode materials with high reversible capacity, safety and long&#8208;term cycling stability are desiderated to meet the ever&#8208;growing demand for alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries with high electrochemical performance. Antimony oxides (SbxOy) show electrochemical reaction activity with all of lithium, sodium and potassium, and are expected to be promising anode materials for alkali metal&#8208;ion storage due to their high theoretical capacities, appropriate operating potential and excellent safety properties. This review is devoted to overview the research progress on reaction mechanism and improvements in electrochemical performance of antimony oxides for alkali metal&#8208;ion storage, and look forward to their further prospects.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidized Bridged Carbenoids as Viable Intermediates in a Fe(III) Catalyzed C&#8211;H Insertion Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fe catalyzed carbene insertion reactions present an efficient route for direct C&#8211;H functionalization. The use of Fe(III) in place of the widely used Fe(II) presents several benefits. However, the mechanistic understanding of Fe(III) severely lags behind Fe(II) complexes. One of the major unsolved issues relates to the formation of bridged versus terminal metallocarbenes. Even though the oxidized bridged carbenoid complexes have been isolated and found to be thermodynamically more stable, they are generally considered a dead end for the catalytic cycle. In the current report, the formation and the subsequent reactions of the bridged carbenoid complexes for an Fe(TPP)Cl catalyzed C(sp2)&#8211;H insertion are investigated. Using DFT calculations, it is observed that both mono and bis oxidized bridged carbenoid complexes can participate in the catalytic cycle. Importantly, for the first time, a mechanistic pathway showing that these bridged species are not a dead end in Fe catalysis is presented. Their existence in other reactions might be more prevalent than what is currently believed. The current study will have important implications in utilizing Fe(III) complexes for other insertion reactions, especially for heme containing enzymes which necessarily need to be carried out under anaerobic/reducing conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Trumpet&#8208;like ZnS@C composite for&#160;high&#8208;performance potassium ion battery anode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>ZnS&#160;has acquired increasing attention for high&#8208;performance PIBs anode because of its remarkable theoretical capacity, and redox reversibility for conversion reaction. However, the larger volume variation and delayed reaction kinetics for the ZnS&#160;in the discharge/charge&#160;processes lead to pulverization and severe capacity degradation.&#160;Herein, the trumpet&#8208;like ZnS@C composite was synthesized by template method using sodium citrate as carbon source followed by vulcanization process. As potassium ion batteries (PIB) anode, ZnS@C composite exhibits good rate performance and long life (stable reversible capacity of 107.8 mAh/g over 2000 charge&#8208;discharge cycles at 5 A/g and high reversible capacity of 310 mAh/g at 0.1 A/g). The outstanding electrochemical performance of the ZnS@C composite is ascribed to its unique structure, which can mitigate the volume expansion of ZnS in the charge discharge process, expand the contact area between the electrode and electrolyte, and improve the conductivity of electrode materials by the introduction of carbon layer. This method of synthesizing trumpet&#8208;like ZnS@C composite provides an important strategy for obtaining potassium ion batteries anode with long cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Wavelength&#8208;Tunable Circularly Polarized Luminescence Film Constructed by Responsive Chiral Aggregation&#8208;induced Emission Luminophore</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circularly polarized luminescent (CPL) materials with multitudinous inherent advantages shows extensive application. In this work, we prepare a kind of highly efficient wavelength&#8208;tunable CPL free&#8208;standing films by responsive chiral aggregation&#8208;induced emission mesogen. Firstly, the pyridine&#8208;functionalized tetraphenylethene monomer (MPy) is designed and synthesized. Then, the different ration of the monomer MPy mixed with the liquid crystal (LC) reactive monomer (LC242) to fabricate a free&#8208;standing film by photopolymerization. The obtained film presents efficient CPL with a constant luminescence asymmetry factor (glum) of +0.75, as well as sensitive wavelength tunability. Finally, this wavelength&#8208;tunable CPL film with both fluorescence and CPL modes is successfully applied in anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption. This work provides a simple way to construct CPL apparatus with adjustable luminescence wavelength and high glum.</dc:description>

         <title>Bis[1]benzothieno[1,4]thiaborins as a Platform for BODIPY Singlet Oxygen Photosensitizers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A synthetic approach to two regioisomeric &#960;&#8208;electron extended [1,4]thiaborins anellated with two benzothiophene units was developed. Obtained boracycles exhibit different electronic properties of the central thiaborin ring reflected in their different aromatic characters, boron Lewis acidity and UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopic behavior. Thiaborins were converted to boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) complexes. Their emission spectra exhibit two distinct bands resulting from 1LE and 1CT transitions. Strong near infrared phosphorescence in Zeonex thin films at 77 K indicates efficient intersystem crossing and formation of triplet states. Separation of HOMO and LUMO orbitals between boracyclic and BODIPY moieties facilitates the electron transfer to a 1CT state followed by a transition to the 3LE triplet state located on the ligand. These unique properties of spiro thiaborin&#8208;BODIPY complexes were explored for their application as singlet&#8208;oxygen photosensitizers. They show excellent photocatalytic performance with singlet oxygen quantum yields reaching 77% and full conversion of the model organic substrate achieved after 1.5 h with only 0.05% mol catalyst load.</dc:description>

         <title>(3+2)&#8208;Cyclization reactions of unsaturated phosphonites with aldehydes and thioketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By exploiting the unique reactivity of ethynyl&#8208;phosphonites we obtain novel P(V)&#8208;containing five&#8208;membered heterocycles via (3+2)&#8208;cyclization reactions with aldehydes or cycloaliphatic thioketones in satisfactory to excellent yields. Whereas reactions with thioketones to yield 1,3&#8208;thiaphospholes&#8208;3&#8208;oxides occur smoothly at room temperature with equimolar amounts of the starting materials in absence of any catalyst, the analogous conversions with aldehydes to generate 3&#8208;oxides of 1,3&#8208;oxaphospholes require addition of triethylamine as a base. We postulate a step&#8208;wise (3+2)&#8208;cyclization mechanism for the formation of the 1,3&#8208;thiaphosphole ring based on DFT quantum chemical calculations. With this study, we introduce new cyclization reactions originating from unsaturated phosphonites as central synthetic building blocks to yield previously inaccessible stable phosphorus&#8208;containing heterocycles with unexplored potential for the molecular sciences.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox reporter &#8211; ligand competition to support signaling in the cocaine&#8208;binding electrochemical aptamer&#8208;based biosensor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical aptamer&#8208;based (E&#8208;AB) biosensors have demonstrated capabilities in monitoring molecules directly in undiluted complex matrices and in the body with the hopes of addressing personalized medicine challenges. This sensing platform relies on an electrode&#8208;bound, redox&#8208;reporter&#8208;modified aptamer. The electrochemical signal is thought to originate from the aptamer undergoing a binding&#8208;induced conformational change capable of moving the redox reporter closer to the electrode surface. While this is the generally accepted mechanism, it is notable that there is limited evidence demonstrating conformational change or distance&#8208;dependent change in electron transfer rates in E&#8208;AB sensors. In response, we investigate here the signal transduction of the well&#8208;studied cocaine&#8208;binding aptamer with different analytical methods and found that this sensor relies on a redox&#8208;reporter &#8211; ligand competition mechanism rather than a ligand&#8208;induced structure formation mechanism. Our results show that the covalently bound redox reporter, methylene blue, binds at or near the ligand binding site on the aptamer resulting in a folded conformation of the cocaine&#8208;binding aptamer. Addition of ligand then competes with the redox reporter for binding, altering its electron transfer rate. While we show this for the cocaine&#8208;binding aptamer, given the prevalence of methylene blue in E&#8208;AB sensors, a similar competition&#8208;based may occur in other systems.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical aptamer-based (E-AB) biosensors have demonstrated capabilities in monitoring molecules directly in undiluted complex matrices and in the body with the hopes of addressing personalized medicine challenges. This sensing platform relies on an electrode-bound, redox-reporter-modified aptamer. The electrochemical signal is thought to originate from the aptamer undergoing a binding-induced conformational change capable of moving the redox reporter closer to the electrode surface. While this is the generally accepted mechanism, it is notable that there is limited evidence demonstrating conformational change or distance-dependent change in electron transfer rates in E-AB sensors.

         <title>Rationalizing the Extent of the &#8220;Sergeants&#8208;and&#8208;Soldiers&#8221; Effect in Supramolecular Helical Catalysts: Effect of Copper Coordination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lower optical purities of supramolecular helical catalysts embedding a low fraction of &#8220;sergeants&#8221; is due to the aggregation of single helices through copper crosslinks.[MR1]&#160;







Abstract
Aggregation of supramolecular helices, for example through interdigitation of their alkyl side chains or through more directional supramolecular interactions, leads to hierarchical architectures with original structural and chiroptical properties. However, when a chiral monomer (the &#8220;sergeant&#8221;) is introduced as a minor component in these assemblies composed of a majority of achiral monomers (the &#8220;soldiers&#8221;), it is not clear how the aggregation changes the ability of the sergeant to induce a preferential helicity to the polymer main chain (the so&#8208;called &#8220;sergeants&#8208;and&#8208;soldiers&#8221; effect). This study reports a detailed investigation of the influence of [Cu(OAc)2&#8901;H2O] coordination on the structure and chiroptical properties of helical hydrogen&#8208;bonded co&#8208;assemblies composed of a catalytically&#8208;active benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) monomer, acting as the &#8220;soldier&#8221;, and an enantiopure BTA monomer derived from cyclohexylalanine, playing the role of the &#8220;sergeant&#8221;. The copper actually significantly influences the extent of the &#8220;sergeants&#8208;and&#8208;soldiers&#8221; effect since it acts as a crosslink that induces some chiral defects in the supramolecular helices. These crosslinks appear to be preserved during the catalytic hydrosilylation of 4&#8208;nitroacetophenone. The aggregation of helices through the formation of copper crosslinks is reversible since homochiral single helices are exclusively formed in the case of sergeant&#8208;rich assemblies. The fact that both main chain and side chain aggregation affects the chiroptical properties of supramolecular helices must be considered in the design of elaborated chiral materials.

         <dc:description>
We have reported discovered pentafluorophenol to be an effective catalyst for the Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction, which synthesizes to synthesize (spirocyclic) tetrahydro &#946; carbolines. This simple catalytic methodology uses features mild conditions to generate high yields of indole alkaloids to produce indole alkaloids in high yield with remarkable functional group tolerance, including late&#8208;stage modifications. This strategy demonstrates a practical approach for synthesizing to the synthesis of the natural alkaloid Komavine on a gram&#8208;scale, as well as the synthesis of the commercial drug Tadalafil.







Abstract
Herein, we have disclosed pentafluorophenol as an operative catalyst for synthesizing (spirocyclic) tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines via the Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction. This straightforward catalytic protocol works under mild conditions resulting indole alkaloids in excellent yield with remarkable functional group tolerance, including late&#8208;stage modifications. This transformation demonstrates a practical and adaptable approach to produce a highly effective gram&#8208;scale synthesis of the natural alkaloid Komavine and enables the synthesis of the commercial drug Tadalafil.

Color&#8208;tunable luminescence materials: Homonuclear EuP and TbP as well as chemically and physically mixed Eu/Tb phosphonates exhibit color&#8208;tunable luminescence even near white&#8208;light emission, among which TbP is further used for Fe3+ detection.







Abstract
Molecular lanthanide phosphonates [Ln2(H3tpmm)2(H2O)6]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xH2O (Ln=Eu, EuP; Ln=Tb, TbP) were synthesized. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction confirmed that EuP has a sandwich&#8208;like dinuclear structure, in which the Eu(III) center adopts a {EuO8} distorted dodecahedral geometry. XRPD patterns prove that TbP and EuP are isomorphous and isostructural. EuP and TbP are highly thermally stable approaching 450&#8201;&#176;C and exhibit red&#8208; and green&#8208;light emissions from the characteristic 4&#8201;f&#8211;4&#8201;f transition of the Eu3+ and Tb3+, respectively. Interestingly, luminescence modulation is achieved for the chemically mixed Eu/Tb phosphonate analogues, c&#8208;EuxTb2&#8211;xP (x=1.5, 1, 0.5), and physically mixed Eu/Tb phosphonate materials, p&#8208;yEuP&#8201;:&#8201;zTbP (y&#8201;:&#8201;z=3&#8201;:&#8201;1, 1&#8201;:&#8201;1, 1&#8201;:&#8201;3), with varying the excitation wavelength. Of particular note, near&#8208;white&#8208;light emission is also achieved for c&#8208;EuTbP, p&#8208;EuP&#8201;:&#8201;TbP, and p&#8208;EuP&#8201;:&#8201;3TbP when excited at 365&#8197;nm. Therefore, these dinuclear molecular lanthanide phosphonates emitting excitation wavelength and Eu3+&#8201;:&#8201;Tb3+ ratio dependent luminescence might be potential candidates for color&#8208;tunable luminescence materials and white&#8208;light&#8208;emitting materials. On the other hand, the bright green&#8208;light emission makes TbP to be an excellent reusable luminescence sensor for selective detection of Fe3+ with Stern&#8208;Volmer quenching constant (KSV) of 9.66&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1 and detection limit (DL) of 0.42&#8197;&#956;M through absorption competition caused luminescence quenching effect.

         <title>Pro&#8208;aromaticity Enabled Dealkenylative Functionalizations via Photo&#8208;Excitation and Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dealkenylative Giese&#8208;type addition, hydrazination, borylation, Minisci&#8208;type alkylation, copper&#8208;catalyzed NH alkylation, acylation, alkynylation, cyanation, and azidation, have been achieved on olefin&#8208;containing substrates in a one&#8208;pot and highly modular fashion.







Abstract
A general and practical approach for diverse dealkenylative functionalization of olefin&#8208;containing substrates has been developed through the one&#8208;pot formation and utilization of pro&#8208;aromatic 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridazines using tetrazine as the key cycloaddition reagent. Triggered by either excitation or oxidation, the targeted C&#8722;C bonds in the 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridazine intermediates could be readily cleaved to generate alkyl radicals for subsequent transformations. Diverse carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;hetero bond forming protocols, including Giese&#8208;type addition, hydrazination, borylation, Minisci&#8208;type alkylation, copper&#8208;catalyzed NH alkylation, acylation, alkynylation, cyanation, and azidation, are achieved in a highly modular fashion.

         <title>Highly Stereospecific On&#8208;Surface Dimerization into Bishelicenes: Topochemical Ullmann Coupling of Bromohelicene on Au(111)</title>

Only same handedness please! On&#8208;surface Ullmann C&#8722;C coupling of bromohelicene enantiomers leads stereospecifically only to homochiral combinations into bis(helicene).







Abstract
The on&#8208;surface dimerization into bis(hexahelicene) on a gold(111) surface has been studied by means of scanning tunneling microscopy and time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary mass spectrometry. C&#8722;C Ullmann coupling of (rac)&#8208;2&#8208;bromo&#8208;hexahelicene leads to formation of the (M,M)&#8208; and (P,P)&#8208;diastereomers of 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bis(hexahelicene), whilst formation of the (M,P)&#8208;diastereomer is not observed. Upon cooling, the bis(hexahelicene) aggregates into an ordered two&#8208;dimensional lattice with partly randomly distributed enantiomers. The highly specific diastereomeric coupling is explained by the surface alignment of educt in combination with the strong steric overcrowding in a possible surface&#8208;confined (M,P)&#8208;product.

         <title>Azide&#8211;Enolate Cycloaddition&#8208;Rearrangement Enables Direct &#945;&#8208;Amination of Amides and Enelactam Synthesis from Esters
</title>

         <dc:description>
Diverse frameworks via cycloaddition&#8208;rearrangement: Azide&#8208;enolate cycloaddition&#8208;rearrangements were applied to the direct &#945;&#8208;amination of amides and lactams, and synthesis of ene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams from esters. The outcome of the reaction varied by substrate, depending on the fate of triazoline intermediates generated in the cycloaddition. These processes form part of a wider cycloaddition&#8208;rearrangement reaction manifold providing concise access to diverse frameworks.







Abstract
Azide&#8208;enolate cycloaddition&#8208;rearrangements offer potential for rapid access to diverse molecular frameworks from simple precursors. We report here that investigations into the cycloadditions of ester or amide enolates with vinyl azides led to the identification of two reaction processes &#8211; direct &#945;&#8208;amination of amides and lactams, and the synthesis of ene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams from esters. The outcomes of these reactions depended on the fate of key vinyl triazoline intermediates generated in the initial cycloaddition step. Isolation of reaction intermediates in the ene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactam synthesis revealed the unexpected addition of two enolate equivalents, one of which is later eliminated. Computational studies further suggested an unusual reaction pathway involving direct addition of an enolate to the terminal carbon of the N&#8208;vinyl triazoline. In contrast, the &#945;&#8208;amination of amides and lactams proceeded by rearrangement of the intermediate triazoline to give an imine, hydrolysis or reduction of which gave access to primary or secondary &#945;&#8208;amino amides or lactams.

         <title>Self&#8208;Supported Ru&#8208;Incorporated NiSe2 for Ampere&#8208;Level Current Density Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;supported Ru&#8208;incorporated NiSe2 (Ru&#8208;NiSe2) catalyst shows high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity with a small overpotential of 180.8&#8197;mV to achieve 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and excellent long&#8208;term stability for large&#8208;current&#8208;density HER in alkaline medium. A great number of accessible catalytically active sites, and well&#8208;modified electronic structure of Ru&#8208;NiSe2 contribute to its high HER activity.







Abstract
To meet the requirements for industrial water splitting to generate hydrogen, it is urgent, but still quite challenging to develop highly active and stable electrocatalysts for large&#8208;current&#8208;density hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, Ru&#8208;incorporated NiSe2 (Ru&#8208;NiSe2) was designed and synthesized. The introduction of Ru results in the formation of hierarchically structured Ru&#8208;NiSe2 with large electrochemical active surface area, and well&#8208;modified electronic structure. As expected, the as&#8208;fabricated Ru&#8208;NiSe2 displays impressive HER activity in 1.0&#8197;M&#8201;KOH, with a low overpotential of 180.8&#8197;mV to reach the current density of 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Ru&#8208;NiSe2 also presents outstanding long&#8208;term stability at high current densities, owing to its high intrinsic chemical stability, and strong catalyst&#8208;support interface. Notably, when performed at a certain current density of 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the overpotential increase after 90&#8197;h is only 13&#8197;mV. Such excellent HER performance of Ru&#8208;NiSe2 demonstrates its great potential for practical use in industrial water splitting.

Abstract
Using benzylamines as the C4 source of 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines (1,4&#8208;DHPs), a Cu&#8208;catalyzed oxidative [1+2+1+2] cascade cyclization for the synthesis of 1,4&#8208;DHPs was firstly developed. A broad range of easily available N,N&#8208;dimethyl enaminones and benzylamines are employed smoothly to provide a diverse range of 1,4&#8208;DHPs with high efficiency. This method is performed by a one&#8208;pot cascade C(sp3)&#8722;H bond functionalization/C(sp3)&#8722;N cleavage/cyclization strategy to form simultaneously two C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) bonds, two C(sp2)&#8722;N bonds, and a 1,4&#8208;DHP ring.

         <title>Controlling Morphologies of Redox&#8208;responsive Polymeric Nanocarriers for a Smart Drug Delivery System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Redox&#8208;responsive nanocarriers using disulfides or thiols have received considerable attention owing to the higher levels of glutathione (GSH) in cancer cells than those in extracellular fluids. Nevertheless, the normal&#8208;to&#8208;cancer&#8208;cell selectivity of these nanocarriers has not yet been clarified. Nanocarriers exhibit different cytotoxicities depending on the morphologies they adopt under the redox&#8208;active conditions typically existing in cancerous cells. Therefore, not only GSH levels but also reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and other complex cancerous cell conditions must be considered for the development of smart drug delivery systems. In this article, we describe the structural design of redox&#8208;responsive polymers that exhibit different morphological changes in environments akin to cancerous cells (e.g., GSH&#8208; and ROS&#8208;abundant conditions). In addition, we propose a molecular design for the spatiotemporal control of nanocarrier morphology depending on the levels of both GSH and ROS upon photoirradiation to increase the cytotoxicity difference between normal and cancer cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoluminescence Properties of Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes Influenced by the Tether Length of Reagents with Two Reactive Sites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The functionalization of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) is an effective method for controlling a local band gap, resulting in photoluminescence (PL) in the near&#8208;infrared region. Herein, SWNTs were functionalized using a series of bromoalkanes and dibromoalkanes to evaluate the effects of their length on the nanotube PL properties. When bromoalkanes (CnH2n+1Br) or dibromoalkanes (CnH2nBr2) with tether lengths of six or more were utilized for six different semiconducting SWNTs, the obtained SWNT adducts exhibited two new PL peaks, whereas dibromoalkanes with tether lengths of 3&#8211;5 (CnH2nBr2: n = 3&#8211;5) produced single peaks. Combined with theoretical calculations, the results suggested that the tether length of reagents changes the formation mechanism of functionalized adducts, that is, CnH2nBr2&#160;(n = 3&#8211;5) tends to result in kinetic products.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Radiosensitive compounds can be useful for the detection of radiations and also as prodrugs that can be activated during a radiotherapy. Herein we describe the use of benzothiazolines, which upon treatment with 137Cs produced &#947;&#8208;irradiation in water give rise to fluorescent benzothiazoles and concomitant release of amines or carboxylic acids. In a proof of concept study, we showed that benzothiazolines may be used as new cleavable linkers that can be triggered upon irradiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Chalcogen Atom Size Dictates Stability of Benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;Triamide Polymers: Overlooked Role of Geometrical Fit for Enhanced Hydrogen Bonding</title>

         <dc:description>Our quantum chemical analyses elucidate how the replacement of O in the amide bonds of benzene&#8208;1,3&#8208;5&#8208;tricarboxamides (OBTAs) for the larger chalcogens S and Se enhances the intermolecular interactions and thereby the stability of the obtained hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular polymers by two unexpected mechanisms: i) the SBTA and SeBTA monomers have a better geometry for self&#8208;assembly and ii) induce stronger covalent (hydrogen&#8208;bond) interactions besides enhanced dispersion interactions. In addition, we show that the cooperativity in BTA self&#8208;assembly is caused by charge separation&#160;in the &#963;&#8208;electronic system following the covalency in the hydrogen bonds.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A flow electrochemical method towards the synthesis of&#160;N&#8208;nitroso compounds from secondary amines using cheap and readily available sodium nitrite was developed. Sodium nitrite dissolved in aqueous acetonitrile made additional electrolytes unnecessary. This mild and straightforward approach made the use of acids or other harsh and toxic chemicals redundant. This procedure was applied to an assortment of cyclic and acyclic secondary amines (27 examples) resulting in yields of&#160;N&#8208;nitrosamines as high as 99%. To demonstrate the practicality of the process, scale&#8208;up reactions were performed. Finally, selected products could be purified using an in&#8208;line acidic extraction.</dc:description>

         <title>Neutral, Heteroleptic [Cu(I)(PPh3)2(4H&#8208;imidazolato)] Complexes: Ligand Exchange Reactivity, Redox Properties, Excited&#8208;State Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hop on hop off: Typically, heteroleptic Cu(I)DiiminePPh3 complexes tend to form the homoleptic counterpart. But this is not observed when the diimine is an anionic 4H&#8208;imidazolate. Despite dynamic PPh3 ligand exchange in solution the deeply colored, photoredox&#8208;active Cu(I)4H&#8208;imidazolatoPPh3 complexes are stable.







Abstract
Cu(I) 4H&#8208;imidazolate complexes are rare examples of Cu(I) complexes with chelating anionic ligands and are potent photosensitizers with unique absorption and photoredox properties. In this contribution, five novel heteroleptic Cu(I) complexes with monodentate triphenylphosphine co&#8208;ligands are investigated. As a consequence of the anionic 4H&#8208;imidazolate ligand and in contrast to comparable complexes with neutral ligands, these complexes are more stable than their homoleptic bis(4H&#8208;imidazolato)Cu(I) congeners. Here, the ligand exchange reactivity was studied by 31P&#8208;,19F&#8208;, and variable temperature NMR and the ground state structural and electronic properties by X&#8208;ray diffraction, absorption spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry. The excited&#8208;state dynamics were investigated by femto&#8208; and nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. The observed differences, with respect to chelating bisphosphine bearing congeners, are often due to the increased geometric flexibility of the triphenylphosphines. These observations render the investigated complexes interesting candidates for photo(redox)reactions not accessible with chelating bisphosphine ligands.

         <title>Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Synthesis of Long&#8208;Chain Oligosaccharides for Studying Xylan&#8208;Modifying Enzymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Xylan biosynthesis: Starting from dixylosides, chemo&#8208;enzymatic syntheses of xylan dodecasaccharides using glycosynthase&#8208;mediated coupling reactions between glycosyl fluoride donors and thioglycoside acceptors were performed. These long&#8208;chain xylan oligosaccharides were incubated with xylan&#8208;modifying enzymes from plants, i.&#8201;e., three glycosyltransferases and one acetyltransferase, and the reaction products were analyzed by MALDI&#8208;MS.







Abstract
Plant research is hampered in several aspects by a lack of pure oligosaccharide samples that closely represent structural features of cell wall glycans. An alternative to purely chemical synthesis to access these oligosaccharides is chemo&#8208;enzymatic synthesis using glycosynthases. These enzymes enable the ligation of oligosaccharide donors, when activated for example as &#945;&#8208;glycosyl fluorides, with suitable acceptor oligosaccharides. Herein, the synthesis of xylan oligosaccharides up to dodecasaccharides is reported, with glycosynthase&#8208;mediated coupling reactions as key steps. The xylo&#8208;oligosaccharide donors were protected at the non&#8208;reducing end with a 4&#8208;O&#8208;tetrahydropyranyl (THP) group to prevent polymerization. Installation of an unnatural 3&#8208;O&#8208;methylether substituent at the reducing end xylose of the oligosaccharides ensured good water solubility. Biochemical assays demonstrated enzymatic activity for the xylan acetyltransferase XOAT1 from Arabidopsis thaliana, xylan arabinofuranosyl&#8208;transferase XAT3 enzymes from rice and switchgrass, and the xylan glucuronosyltransferase GUX3 from Arabidopsis thaliana. In case of the glucuronosyltransferase GUX3, MALDI&#8208;MS/MS analysis of the reaction product suggested that a single glucuronosyl substituent was installed primarily at the central xylose residues of the dodecasaccharide acceptor, demonstrating the value of long&#8208;chain acceptors for assaying biosynthetic glycosyltransferases.

     alt="Chemo-Enzymatic Synthesis of Long-Chain Oligosaccharides for Studying Xylan-Modifying Enzymes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Xylan biosynthesis&lt;/b&gt;: Starting from dixylosides, chemo-enzymatic syntheses of xylan dodecasaccharides using glycosynthase-mediated coupling reactions between glycosyl fluoride donors and thioglycoside acceptors were performed. These long-chain xylan oligosaccharides were incubated with xylan-modifying enzymes from plants, i.&#8201;e., three glycosyltransferases and one acetyltransferase, and the reaction products were analyzed by MALDI-MS.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plant research is hampered in several aspects by a lack of pure oligosaccharide samples that closely represent structural features of cell wall glycans. An alternative to purely chemical synthesis to access these oligosaccharides is chemo-enzymatic synthesis using glycosynthases. These enzymes enable the ligation of oligosaccharide donors, when activated for example as &#945;-glycosyl fluorides, with suitable acceptor oligosaccharides. Herein, the synthesis of xylan oligosaccharides up to dodecasaccharides is reported, with glycosynthase-mediated coupling reactions as key steps. The xylo-oligosaccharide donors were protected at the non-reducing end with a 4-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-tetrahydropyranyl (THP) group to prevent polymerization. Installation of an unnatural 3-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-methylether substituent at the reducing end xylose of the oligosaccharides ensured good water solubility. Biochemical assays demonstrated enzymatic activity for the xylan acetyltransferase XOAT1 from &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt;, xylan arabinofuranosyl-transferase XAT3 enzymes from rice and switchgrass, and the xylan glucuronosyltransferase GUX3 from &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt;. In case of the glucuronosyltransferase GUX3, MALDI-MS/MS analysis of the reaction product suggested that a single glucuronosyl substituent was installed primarily at the central xylose residues of the dodecasaccharide acceptor, demonstrating the value of long-chain acceptors for assaying biosynthetic glycosyltransferases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>ACTIVE&#8208;BAPO &#8211; A Versatile Transfer Agent for Photoactive Bis(acyl)phosphane Oxide Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Active BAPO &#8208; An NHS ester substituted bis(acyl)phosphane oxide (BAPO) is synthesized by phospha&#8208;Michael addition and used as the first versatile transfer agent for the grafting of photoactive BAPO units. Amino acids, porcine skin, and poly(amido)amine (PAMAM) dendrimers were functionalized with the photoactive units and used for the synthesis of thermosets with a different degree of crosslinking.







Abstract
A N&#8208;hydroxy succinimide (NHS) ester substituted bis(acyl)phosphane oxide (ACTIVE&#8208;BAPO) was prepared by phospha&#8208;Michael addition and used for an easy one&#8208;step BAPO ligation with substrates containing primary amino groups, such as amino acids, proteins, and poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers. Thereby, a range of new molecular and polymeric photoinitators was obtained. Real&#8208;time photo&#8208;rheology experiments demonstrated the outstanding efficiency of the PAMAM BAPOs as photoinitiators for free radical polymerization. Remarkably, it is found that PAMAM BAPOs also act as crosslinking agents to convert monofunctional methacrylate monomers into thermosetting networks without any further additives. Depending on the number of the attached BAPOs, thermosets with a different degree of crosslinking and swelling capability in water were obtained.

         <title>Combinatorial Coordination Self&#8208;Assembly for Organopalladium Cages with Fine&#8208;Tuned Structure and Function</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combinatorial coordination self&#8208;assembly is a powerful tool to create the lower&#8208;symmetric coordination cages with increasing structural complexities and advanced functions. In this concept article, we define and summarized the strategy for the combinatorial self&#8208;assembled PdII coordination cages. Emergent functions on some selected PdII coordination cages were also introduced with an aim of emphasizing the advantages of the heteroleptic cages.







Abstract
Discrete organopalladium coordination cages have shown great potential in applications ranging from molecular recognition and sensing, drug delivery to enzymatic catalysis. While many of the known organopalladium cages are homoleptic structures with regular polyhedral shapes and symmetric inner cavities, heteroleptic cages with complex architectures and new functions coming from their anisotropic cavities have received an increasing attention recently. In this concept article, we discuss a powerful combinatorial coordination self&#8208;assembly strategy toward the construction of a family of organopalladium cages, including both homoleptic and heteroleptic ones, from a given library of ligands. Within such a cage family, the heteroleptic cages often feature systematically fine&#8208;tuned structures and emergent properties, distinct from their parent homoleptic counterparts. We hope the concepts and examples provided in this article can offer some rational guidance for the design of new coordination cages toward advanced functions.

         <title>Molecular Hinges by Fusion of Pyrrole and Dithiin: Synthesis, Structure, Redox Chemistry and Host&#8211;Guest Complexation of Dipyrrolo&#8208;1,4&#8208;dithiins</title>

         <dc:description>
A series of novel hinge&#8208;like molecules, namely dipyrrolo&#8208;1,4&#8208;dithiins, were prepared via fusion of pyrroles with 1,4&#8208;dithiin. Their hinged structure, excellent redox&#8208;activity, and adaptive host&#8211;guest chemistry have provided great potentials for developing redox&#8208;switchable host&#8211;guest systems and materials.







Abstract
A series of novel hinge&#8208;like molecules, namely dipyrrolo&#8208;1,4&#8208;dithiins (PDs), were prepared and fully characterized by NMR, UV/vis, cyclic voltammogram, ESR, and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis. The lateral fusion of pyrroles with 1,4&#8208;dithiins has led to not only retained key features of a dithiin, but also enhanced redox&#8208;activity with increased susceptibility to radical cations via redox or chemical oxidation. Stabilization of their radicals are observed for the N,N&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl or N,N&#8208;triphenylmethyl PD as evidenced by ESR measurements. DFT calculations and SCXRD analysis revealed PDs are extremely flexible with adaptive molecular geometries that can be mechanically regulated via crystal packing or host&#8211;guest complexation. The excellent donor nature of PDs renders inclusion complexes with the cyclophane bluebox (cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;p&#8208;phenylene)), featuring association constants up to 104&#8197;M&#8722;1. Additionally, a planarized transition intermediate associated with inversion dynamics of a PD has been preserved in the pseudorotaxane structure with assistances of &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions. The hinged structure, excellent redox&#8208;activity, and adaptive nature of PDs could further enable accesses to exotic redox switchable host&#8211;guest chemistry and functional materials.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Stabilized CsPbI3 Nanocrystals with Tailored Organic Polymer Ligand Binding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable black&#8208;phase &#947;&#8208;CsPbI3 nanocrystals capped with a new organic polymer ligand, HO&#8208;PS&#8208;N3, have been synthesized by hot&#8208;injection method with significantly improved resistance to moisture and light.







Abstract
Perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) exhibit attractive photophysical properties by combining the excellent optoelectronic properties of bulk perovskites with the strong quantum confinement effect at the nanoscale. However, CsPbI3 NCs easily transform into a non&#8208;perovskite phase because of the ionic lattice and dynamic ligand binding. Herein, stable black&#8208;phase CsPbI3 NCs capped with a new organic ligand, HO&#8208;PS&#8208;N3 (HOPS), which consists of a polystyrene segment with hydroxyl and azide end groups, are reported. This organic polymer ligand passivated the surface defects and enhanced the stability of CsPbI3 NCs by exposing the linking hydrophobic polystyrene segment. Consequently, the optimized CsPbI3 NCs exhibit significantly improved resistance to moisture or light and maintained 70&#8201;% of the original luminous intensity after immersion in water for two months. The theoretical results revealed that the binding energy of the HOPS ligand on the surface of the CsPbI3 NCs is higher than that of the commonly used oleic acid, alleviating the defects&#8208;induced degradation during purification. Thus, surface&#8208;stabilized CsPbI3 NCs are beneficial for a broad range of optoelectronic applications.

This Concept article summarizes the progress of azametallacyclopentadienes towards their generated methods, structural characterization, intrinsic reactivity, and application in the heterocyclic synthesis since the new century.







Abstract
As the key intermediates in metal&#8208;promoted/catalyzed C&#8722;C bond coupling reactions of nitriles and alkynes, azametallacyclopentadienes, M(N=CR1&#8722;CR2=CR3), are an important class of azametallacycles. Although the first authentic azametallacyclopentadienes were documented in 1986, their chemistry towards solid&#8208;state structures, intrinsic reactivity, and synthetic application was rarely investigated for a long time. At the beginning of this century, seminal works about the applications of azametallacyclopentadienes in the synthesis of heterocycles, including multi&#8208;substituted pyridines, isoquinolines, furans, and pyrroles were reported. Subsequently, a series of new complexes with this motif, namely the Group 4, aluminum, actinide, and rare&#8208;earth azametallacyclopentadienes were isolated and structurally characterized. Among them, the rare&#8208;earth azametallacyclopentadiene expresses high reactivity towards unsaturated molecules, such as nitriles, isocyanides, and Mo(CO)6 to provide novel fused metallacycles. In this Concept, we reviewed the advances in the preparation, reactivity, and synthetic application of azametallacyclopentadienes in the past twenty years.

         <title>Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Gene Silencing Facilitated by Mito&#8208;CPDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Gene Silencing: We report a mitochondria&#8208;targeted cell&#8208;penetrating poly(disulfide)s (Mito&#8208;CPDs), which is not only compatible with commercially available gene&#8208;silencing reagents without the need of chemical or genetic modifications, but also capable of transporting siRNA and ASO into mitochondria and thereby silencing mtDNA specifically.







Abstract
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) plays an essential role in maintaining normal cellular activities. Its heteroplasmic mutations are known to cause various genetic diseases. Current genetic engineering strategies, such as those based on RNA interference (RNAi) and antisense technology, are difficult to genetically alter mtDNA, however, due to the inability of highly negatively charged oligonucleotides to translocate across the double&#8208;membrane mitochondria. We report herein a universal mitochondria&#8208;targeted gene&#8208;delivery approach by using cell&#8208;penetrating poly(disulfide)s (CPDs). Novel CPD&#8208;based mitochondrial transporters, named Mito&#8208;CPDs, were synthesized by using triphenylphosphonium (TPP)&#8208;fused propagating monomers containing either disulfide or diselenide backbones. Upon spontaneous complex formation with an oligonucleotide (single&#8208; or double&#8208;stranded), the resulting nanoscale Mito&#8208;CPD@Oligo exhibited excellent properties in common biological media. While the intracellular gene&#8208;delivery efficiency of these Mito&#8208;CPDs was comparable to that of commercial transfection agents, their unique mitochondria&#8208;localized properties enabled effective release of the loaded cargo inside these organelles. Subsequent mitochondrial delivery of siRNA and antisense oligonucleotides against suitable mtDNA&#8208;encoded proteins showed successful down&#8208;regulation of target protein expression, leading to profound effects on mitochondrial functions. Mito&#8208;CPDs thus provide a useful tool for future investigations of mitochondrial biology and treatment of mitochondria&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Construction of a Diverse Range of Boron Heterocycles via Ring Expansion of a Carboranyl&#8208;Substituted 9&#8208;Borafluorene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ring expansion of a carboranyl&#8208;substituted 9&#8208;borafluorene with unsaturated substrates provides easy access to a range of boraheterocyclic products containing six&#8208;, seven&#8208;, and eight&#8208;membered rings. Compared to known aryl&#8208; and halogen&#8208;substituted borafluorene derivatives, the study shows that the electron&#8208;withdrawing carboranyl substituent leads to more facile and more selective insertion reactions.







Abstract
Direct insertion of unsaturated substrates into a five&#8208;membered borole ring is a useful method to obtain valuable heterocycles containing one or more three&#8208;coordinate boron atoms. A highly Lewis acidic 9&#8208;o&#8208;carboranyl&#8208;9&#8208;borafluorene, in which the o&#8208;carboranyl substituent is connected via one of the cluster carbon atoms to the boron atom of the 9&#8208;borafluorene unit, was found to react with a vast array of unsaturated molecules, such as alkynes, aldehydes and various organic azides, to form larger boraheterocyclic products. The ring expansion reactions of the central borole ring proceed rapidly at room temperature, cementing the role of the o&#8208;carboranyl substituent in enhancing the insertion reactivity of 9&#8208;borafluorenes.

         <title>Detection of Large Genomic RNA via DNAzyme&#8208;Mediated RNA Cleavage and Rolling Circle Amplification: SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8201;as a Model</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double screening: A new method is reported for rapid, amplified detection of large genomic RNA using SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 as a model. The double screening method first parses a large set of DNAzymes to those that mediate efficient RNA cleavage and then screens the best DNAzymes for effective coupling to rolling circle amplification.







Abstract
A new method for the detection of genomic RNA combines RNA cleavage by the 10&#8208;23 DNAzyme and use of the cleavage fragments as primers to initiate rolling circle amplification (RCA). 230 different 10&#8208;23 DNAzyme variants were screened to identify those that target accessible RNA sites within the highly structured RNA transcripts of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. A total of 28 DNAzymes were identified with &gt;20&#8201;% cleavage, 5 with &gt;40&#8201;% cleavage and one with &gt;60&#8201;% in 10&#8197;min. The cleavage fragments from these reactions were then screened for coupling to an RCA reaction, leading to the identification of several cleavage fragments that could efficiently initiate RCA. Using a newly developed quasi&#8208;exponential RCA method with a detection limit of 500 aM of RNA, 14 RT&#8208;PCR positive and 15 RT&#8208;PCR negative patient saliva samples were evaluated for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 genomic RNA, achieving a clinical sensitivity of 86&#8201;% and specificity of 100&#8201;% for detection of the virus in &lt;2.5&#8197;h.

         <title>Wide&#8208;Temperature Flexible Supercapacitor from an Organohydrogel Electrolyte and Its Combined Electrode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multipurpose gels: A flexible supercapacitor that integrates a wide application temperature range (&#8722;20&#8211;80&#8201;&#176;C), satisfactory electrochemical performance and mechanical properties has been fabricated by using ionic conductive, anti&#8208;freezing and anti&#8208;drying organohydrogels both as electrolyte and binder of the combined electrode.







Abstract
Hydrogel&#8208;based flexible supercapacitors possess the merits of highly ionic conductivity and superior power density, but the existence of water limits their application in extreme temperature scenarios. Noticeably, it is a challenge for people to design more extremely temperature adaptable systems for flexible supercapacitors based on hydrogels with a wide temperature region. In this work, a wide&#8208;temperature flexible supercapacitor that can operate at &#8722;20&#8211;80&#8201;&#176;C was fabricated by an organohydrogel electrolyte and its combined electrode (also known as an electrode/electrolyte composite). Upon introducing highly hydratable LiCl into an ethylene glycol (EG)/H2O binary solvent, owing to the ionic hydration effect of LiCl and the hydrogen bond interaction between EG and H2O molecules, the organohydrogel electrolyte exhibits satisfactory resistance to freezing (freezing point of &#8722;113.9&#8201;&#176;C), anti&#8208;drying capability (78.2&#8201;% of weight retention after vacuum drying at 60&#8201;&#176;C for 12&#8197;h) and excellent ionic conductivity both at room temperature (13.9&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and low temperature (6.5&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 after 31&#8197;days at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C). By using organohydrogel electrolyte as binder, the prepared electrode/electrolyte composite effectively reduces interface impedance and enhances specific capacitance due to the uninterrupted ion transport channels and extended interface contact area. The assembled supercapacitor delivers a specific capacitance of 149&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1, a power density of 160&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1, and an energy density of 13.24&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a current density of 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. The initial 100&#8201;% capacitance can be maintained after 2000 cycles at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. More importantly, the specific capacitances can be well maintained even at &#8722;20 and 80&#8201;&#176;C. With other advantages such as excellent mechanical property, the supercapacitor is an ideal power source suitable for various working conditions.

In this work, a wide-temperature flexible supercapacitor that can operate at &#8722;20&#8211;80&#8201;&#176;C was fabricated by an organohydrogel electrolyte and its combined electrode (also known as an electrode/electrolyte composite). Upon introducing highly hydratable LiCl into an ethylene glycol (EG)/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O binary solvent, owing to the ionic hydration effect of LiCl and the hydrogen bond interaction between EG and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecules, the organohydrogel electrolyte exhibits satisfactory resistance to freezing (freezing point of &#8722;113.9&#8201;&#176;C), anti-drying capability (78.2&#8201;% of weight retention after vacuum drying at 60&#8201;&#176;C for 12&#8197;h) and excellent ionic conductivity both at room temperature (13.9&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and low temperature (6.5&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 31&#8197;days at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C). By using organohydrogel electrolyte as binder, the prepared electrode/electrolyte composite effectively reduces interface impedance and enhances specific capacitance due to the uninterrupted ion transport channels and extended interface contact area. The assembled supercapacitor delivers a specific capacitance of 149&#8197;F&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, a power density of 160&#8197;W&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and an energy density of 13.24&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at a current density of 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The initial 100&#8201;% capacitance can be maintained after 2000 cycles at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. More importantly, the specific capacitances can be well maintained even at &#8722;20 and 80&#8201;&#176;C. With other advantages such as excellent mechanical property, the supercapacitor is an ideal power source suitable for various working conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structurally Ordered PtNi Intermetallic Nanoparticles as Efficient and Stable Cathode Catalysts for Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ordered intermetallic PtNi nanoparticles loaded on graphited carbon were synthesized using a facile method. The ORR performance can be significantly improved via turning the element distribution of PtNi intermetallic compounds catalysts into ordered structure by high temperature annealing. Benefiting from a highly graphitized carbon support with excellent corrosion resistance, the obtained ordered catalysts with Pt loading of 27.6&#8201;% exhibit higher activity and better durability toward ORR than commercial Pt/C, which have been verified in both RDE test and single cell test.







Abstract
Exploring oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts with superior electrochemical performance and long&#8208;term stability is crucial to the development of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). In this work, graphited carbon with high specific surface area was obtained under relatively low temperature using Ni catalyst, then ordered nanoparticles (NPs) PtNi catalysts attaching to graphited carbon were synthesized via polyol reduction and thermal treatment. Benefiting from graphitized carbon support and appropriate order degree, PtNi/GC&#8208;700 NPs catalyst exhibits excellent electrocatalytic ORR performance with specific and mass activities as high as 2.8&#8208;fold and 3.7&#8208;fold of the commercial Pt/C catalyst, respectively. Besides, the as&#8208;prepared PtNi/GC&#8208;700 catalyst exhibits superior stability with negligible degradation after 10000 potential cycles, due to its ordered chemical structure. The work described herein highlights the potential of structurally ordered electrocatalysts for efficient and durable fuel cell cathodic catalysts.

         <title>Precise Control of Dissipative Self&#8208;assembly by Light and Electricity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using light and electricity as two clean and spatiotemporally addressable fuels, we can precisely control dissipative self&#8208;assembly into various morphologies including asymmetric forms without altering the solution composition. Such precise control over supramolecular assemblies may find future applications in programming complex active materials as well as formulating pharmaceutical reagents with desired morphologies.







Abstract
Nature&#8208;inspired synthetic dissipative self&#8208;assemblies have attracted much attention recently. However, it remains a major challenge to achieve precise control over dissipative supramolecular assembly structures and functions of self&#8208;contained systems. Here we combine light and electricity as two clean, and spatiotemporally addressable fuels to provide precise control over the morphology for dissipative self&#8208;assembly of a perylene bisimide glycine (PBIg) building block in a self&#8208;contained solution. In this design, electrochemical oxidation provides the positive fuel to activate PBIg self&#8208;assembly while photoreduction supplies the negative fuel to deactivate the system for disassembly. Through programming the two counteracting fuels, we demonstrated the control of PBIg self&#8208;assembly into a variety of assembly morphologies in a self&#8208;contained system. In addition, by exerting light and electrical dual fuels simultaneously, we could create an active homeostasis exhibiting dynamic instability, leading to morphological change to asymmetric assemblies with curvatures. Such precise control over self&#8208;assembly of self&#8208;contained systems may find future applications in programming complex active materials as well as formulating pharmaceutical reagents with desired morphologies.

         <title>Double Addition vs. Ring Closure: Systematic Reactivity Study of CO(NCO)2 and CO(NCS)2 towards Hydrogen Halides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions between carbonyl diisocyanate or isothiocyanate and hydrogen halide gases as stereotypical nucleophiles show two different reaction pathways. The diisocyanate adds nucleophiles to form carbamoyl halides, whereas the isothiocyanate undergoes ring closure forming thiadiazines. These reactions indicate the significant influence of the chalcogen atom on the reaction products as well as their stability and characteristics. More information can be found in the Research Article by F. Tambornino and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203983). Artwork by Janina Ill.

         <title>Isomerization of DASA Molecules in the Nanopores of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks: What Determines Its Reversibility?
</title>

         <dc:description>
Isomerization reversibility of visible&#8208;light responsive donor&#8211;acceptor Stenhouse adducts in nanopores of metal&#8211;organic frameworks is strongly dependent on the polarity of their pore environment. In low polar MIL&#8208;53(Al), proton conductivity as high as 0.013 S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and at least 30 switching cycles are achieved under visible light at 80&#8201;&#176;C and 98&#8201;% RH.







Abstract
In recent years, light&#8208;responsive molecules have been incorporated in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) to fabricate light&#8208;responsive intelligent devices, where reversible isomerization of the guest molecules in the nanopores is crucial. However, how to design a porous environment of MOFs to achieve a reversible isomerization remains unknown until now. In this work, donor&#8211;acceptor Stenhouse adducts (DASAs), a new kind of visible light responsive compound, were confined in the nanopores of different MOFs to study their isomerization upon visible&#8208;light irradiation/mild heating. We found that the polarity of the pore environment is the key to control the reversibility of isomerization of such guest molecules. Under the guidance of this principle, MIL&#8208;53(Al) was screened to investigate the proton conductivity and switching performance of the DASA&#8208;confined MOF. The proton conductance was up to 0.013 S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C and 98&#8201;% RH, and at least 30 switching cycles were achieved thanks to the Grotthuss&#8208;type mechanism and the low polarity of MIL&#8208;53(Al) pore environment.

         <title>Highly E&#8208;Selective Olefin Synthesis Catalysed by Novel Quinoxalinone Photocatalyst under Visible Light Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method for the synthesis of highly E&#8208;selective olefins directly utilizing alkyl boronic acids as radical precursors was developed, catalysed by novel quinoxalinone&#8208;type catalyst.







Abstract
In photo&#8208;induced olefin synthesis, the photocatalysts with high triplet energy could cause the isomerization of olefins. This study demonstrates a new quinoxalinone photocatalytic system for highly stereoselective alkenes preparation from alkenyl sulfones and alkyl boronic acids. Our photocatalyst could not convert the thermodynamically favored E&#8208;olefin to Z&#8208;olefin, guaranteeing the high E&#8208;configuration selectivity of the reaction. There is weak interaction between boronic acids and quinoxalinone according to NMR experiments, probably decreasing the oxidation potential of boronic acids. This system can be further extended to the allyl and alkynyl sulfones to give corresponding alkenes and alkynes.

         <dc:description>
Shedding light on the structure and solvation state of lithium compounds in aligned solution: The residual quadrupolar coupling of 7Li in a range of lithium complexes due to the interaction of the electric field gradient (shown in its graphical tensor form) with the alignment in a stretched polymer gel has been investigated using NMR spectroscopy. The preferred orientation of the molecules in the anisotropic environment is illustrated in the background. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. John and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203995).

         <title>Breaking the DFT Energy Bias Caused by Intramolecular Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Interactions with MESSI, a Structural Elucidation Method Inspired by Wisdom of the Crowd Theory</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of quantum&#8208;based NMR methods to complement and guide the connectivity and stereochemical assignment of natural and unnatural products has grown enormously. One of the unsolved problems is related to the improper calculation of the conformational landscape of flexible molecules that have functional groups capable of generating a complex network of intramolecular H&#8208;bonding (IHB) interactions. Here we present MESSI (Multi&#8208;Ensemble Strategy for Structural Identification), a method inspired by the wisdom of the crowd theory that breaks with the traditional mono&#8208;ensemble approach. By including independent mappings of selected artificially manipulated ensembles, MESSI greatly improves the sense of the assignment by neutralizing potential energy biases.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Mediated Photocatalytic Deracemization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric catalysis has long been recognized as a powerful tool for the synthesis of enantioenriched molecules. In addition to precise enantiocontrol, high&#8208;atom economy has always been pursued by chemists in the development of methodologies, which is crucial for practicality. Consequently, deracemization, the direct conversion of a racemic compound to one of its enantiomers, and thus characterized by a 100% atom efficiency, has attracted increasing interest. Recently, visible light&#8208;driven photocatalysis has been demonstrated as a promising platform for the development of deracemization. Central to its success can be attributed to its ability to efficiently overcome the prevailing kinetic issues in chemical transformations and the intrinsic thermodynamic challenges, which typically require the use of additional stoichiometric reagents and thus undermine the original advantage. In this review, the advances in this attractive area are systematically summarized and discussed, with examples organized according to the different modalities of energy transfer and single&#8208;electron transfer in photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade Reaction of Diynamides with Allylic Alcohols: A Versatile Platform to Allenamide, 2&#8208;Aminofuran and Bridged [2.2.2]Octadiene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed divergent synthesis through alternation of the catalyst is appealing, as it provides an operationally simple way to access different valuable products, while using the same reactants as starting materials. Herein, a gold&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction of conjugated diynamides with allylic alcohols is described. By variation of the catalysts, substituted allenes and furans could be obtained selectively. Mechanistic studies indicate that, after the addition of allylic alcohol to gold&#8208;activated diynamide, a [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement would take place and lead to the formation of a common reactive intermediate, which would further convert to the final products selectively. Further variation of the structure of diynamides has unveiled an additional reaction sequence involving intramolecular Himbert arene/allene Diels&#8722;Alder cycloaddition to afford a series of dearomatized products bearing bicyclo[2,2,2]octadiene core.</dc:description>

         <title>Insight into the Structural and Emissive Behavior of a 3&#8208;Dimensional Americium(III) Formate Coordination Polymer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the structural, vibrational, and optical properties of americium formate (Am(CHO2)3) crystals synthesized via the in situ hydrolysis of dimethylformamide (DMF). The coordination polymer features Am3+ ions linked by formate ligands into a 3&#8208;dimensional network that is isomorphous to several lanthanide analogs, (e.g. Eu3+, Nd3+, Tb3+). Structure determination revealed a nine&#8208;coordinate Am3+ metal center that features a unique local C3v symmetry. The metal&#8208;ligand bonding interactions were investigated using infrared spectroscopy measurements, natural localized molecular orbital calculations, and the quantum theory of atoms in molecules. The results all paint a dominantly ionic bond picture and suggest the metal&#8208;oxygen bonds increase in strength from Nd&#8208;O &lt; Eu&#8208;O &lt; Am&#8208;O. The optical properties were probed using diffuse reflectance and photoluminescence spectroscopies.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We report the structural, vibrational, and optical properties of americium formate (Am(CHO2)3) crystals synthesized via the in situ hydrolysis of dimethylformamide (DMF). The coordination polymer features Am3+ ions linked by formate ligands into a 3-dimensional network that is isomorphous to several lanthanide analogs, (e.g. Eu3+, Nd3+, Tb3+). Structure determination revealed a nine-coordinate Am3+ metal center that features a unique local C3v symmetry. The metal-ligand bonding interactions were investigated using infrared spectroscopy measurements, natural localized molecular orbital calculations, and the quantum theory of atoms in molecules. The results all paint a dominantly ionic bond picture and suggest the metal-oxygen bonds increase in strength from Nd-O &amp;lt; Eu-O &amp;lt; Am-O. The optical properties were probed using diffuse reflectance and photoluminescence spectroscopies. Notably, the rarely reported 5D1&#8242; &#8594; 7F1&#8242; emission band is observed and dominates the emission spectrum. This behavior is unusual and is attributed to the C3v coordination environment of the metal center.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering the BASHY Dye Platform toward Architectures with Responsive Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A set of nine boronic&#8208;acid derived salicylidenehydrazone (BASHY) complexes was synthesized in good to very good chemical yields in a versatile three&#8208;component reaction. In extension to previous reports on this dye platform, the focus was put on the electronic modification of the &#8220;vertical&#8221; positions of the salicylidenehydrazone backbone. This enabled the observation of fluorescence quenching by photoinduced electron transfer (PeT), which can be reverted by the addition of acid in organic solvent (OFF&#8208;ON fluorescence switching). The resulting emission is observed in the green&#8208;to&#8208;orange spectral region (maxima at 520&#8211;590 nm). On the contrary, under physiological pH conditions in water the PeT process is inherently decativated, enabling the observation of fluorescence in the red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR region (maxima at 650&#8211;680 nm) with appreciable quantum yields and lifetimes. The latter characteristic supported the application of the dyes in fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) of live A549 cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Overcoming Energy Transfer for the Metallophotoredox Catalyzed Decarboxylative Alkenylation between Alkylcarboxylic Acids and Enol Triflates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report on the decarboxylative alkenylation between alkyl carboxylic acids and enol triflates. The reaction is mediated by a dual catalytic nickel and iridium system, operating under visible light irradiation. Two competing catalytic pathways, from the excited state iridium photocatalyst, are identified. One is energy transfer from the excited state, resulting in formation of an undesired enol ester. The desired pathway involves electron transfer, resulting in decarboxylation to ultimately give the target product. The use of a highly oxidizing iridium photocatalyst is essential to control the reactivity. A diverse array of enol triflates and alkyl carboxylic acids are investigated, providing both scope and limitations of the presented methodology.</dc:description>

         <title>Composites of HKUST&#8208;1@Nanocellulose for gas&#8208;separation and dye&#8208;sorption applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, composites of HKUST&#8208;1 MOF with nanocellulose, HKUST&#8208;1@NCs, have been prepared and explored for CO2/N2 gas&#8208;separation and dye&#8208;sorption based applications. Our biopolymer&#8208;MOF composites are prepared via a copper ion pre&#8208;seeding method, in which, the HKUST&#8208;1 crystallites are grown in situ on the Cu&#8208;seeded and carboxylate anchored NC fibers for a better interfacial integration between the MOF and the polymer matrices. One of our HKUST&#8208;1@NC composites show ~300% enhancement in the CO2/N2 sorption selectivity. The same composite, C100, in the bulk powder form, shows a remarkable IAST sorption selectivity of 298 (CO2/N2) at 298 K and 1 bar for the CO2/N2 (15/85, v/v) gas mixture. The HKUST&#8208;1@NC composites have also been processed along with a polymeric cellulose acetate (CA) matrix as HKUST&#8208;1@NC@CA films to study them as free&#8208;standing mixed&#8208;matrix membranes. The CO2/N2 sorption selectivity, at 298 K and 1 bar is 600 for one such membrane, C&#8208;120@CA, as bulk sample studied by the static gas sorption. The composite, C120, exhibits a good uptake with an enhancement of 11% for alizarin and 70% for Congo red in comparison to the uptakes of the corresponding blank reference HKUST&#8208;1 sample, B120.</dc:description>

         <title>A Cytoplasm&#8208;Specific Fluorescent Ligand for Selective Imaging of RNA G&#8208;quadruplexes in Live Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of site&#8208;specific, target&#8208;selective and biocompatible small molecule ligands as a fluorescent tool for real&#8208;time study of cellular functions of RNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s), which are associated with human cancers, is of significance in cancer biology. We report a fluorescent ligand that is a cytoplasm&#8208;specific and RNA G4&#8208;selective fluorescent biosensor in live HeLa cells. The in vitro results show that the ligand is highly selective targeting RNA G4s including VEGF, NRAS, BCL2 and TERRA. These G4s are recognized as human cancer hallmarks. Moreover, intracellular competition studies with BRACO19 and PDS, and the colocalization study with G4&#8208;specific antibody (BG4) in HeLa cells may support that the ligand is highly selective binding to G4s in cellulo. Furthermore, the ligand was demonstrated for the first time in the visualization and monitoring of dynamic resolving process of RNA G4s by the overexpressed RFP&#8208;tagged DHX36 helicase in live HeLa cells.</dc:description>

         <title>&#8220;Catch&#8208;Store&#8208;Release&#8221; Strategy for the Stabilization of 4,4&#8217;&#8208;Methylene Diphenyl Diisocyanate (4,4&#8217;&#8208;MDI)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>4,4&#8217;&#8208;Methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) is an industrially crucial compound, being one of the most utilized linkers in the polyurethane industry. However, its long&#8208;term stability is limited due to dimerization to form insoluble uretdione. Herein we demonstrate an organometallic &#8220;catch&#8208;store&#8208;release&#8221; concept aiming at improving long&#8208;term chemical stability of MDI. Treatment of MDI with two equivalents of selected N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHC) forms stable MDI&#8208;NHC adducts. Treatment of the adducts with CuCl forms metastable di&#8208;Cu(I) complexes, which undergo decomposition to reform MDI (up to 85%), along with Cu&#8208;NHC complexes. The yield of reformed MDI can be improved (up to 95%) by the release of the NHC ligands in the form of thiourea, which prevents subsequent MDI dimerization/polymerization by the carbenes. Furthermore, the need to separate MDI from the reaction mixture can be eliminated by the direct reaction of MDI&#8208;NHC complexes with alcohols (as model for diols), which form dicarbamate (as model for polyurethane) quantitatively.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Fluorescent Carbon Dots (CDs) for the Selective detection of Metal&#8208;Containing Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pollution caused by heavy metals (HMs) may occur through both natural processes and anthropogenic activities and is found in complex media. The purpose of this review is to summarize the state&#8208;of&#8208;art of fluorescent CDs and the sensing applications in a systematic manner. This review intends to provide clues on the origin on the observed selectivity in chemiluminiscence sensors, which was until now a stated but unaddressed question, and still remains open for debate. Indeed, it is tempting to think that CDs possessing functional groups with soft bases at the surface are able to detect soft metal acids, while the opposite is to be suspected for hard acid&#8208;base pairs. However, the literature shows several examples where this trend does not hold. We found that such observation is explained by the involvement of dynamic quenching, which does not involve the formation of a non&#8208;fluorescent complex, as in the case of static quenching. We have provided an interpretation of published data that was not provided by the original authors and offer guidelines to enable the design of CDs to target ions in solution.</dc:description>

         <title>Ruthenium Complexes of Polyfluorocarbon Substituted Terpyridine and Mesoionic Carbene Ligands: An Interplay in CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years terpyridines (tpy) and mesoionic carbenes (MIC) have been widely used in metal complexes. With the right combination with a metal center, both of these ligands are individually known to generate excellent catalysts for CO2 reduction. In this study, we combine the potentials of PFC (PFC = polyfluorocarbon) substituted tpy and MIC ligands within the same platform to obtain a new class of complexes, which we investigated with respect to their structural, electrochemical and UV/Vis/NIR spectroelectrochemical properties. We further show that the resulting metal complexes are potent electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction in which CO is exclusively formed with a faradaic efficiency of 92%. A preliminary mechanistic study, including the isolation and characterization of a key intermediate is also reported.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of Alpha&#8208;Synuclein Proteins via Solid&#8208;Phase Peptide Synthesis and Native Chemical Ligation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alpha&#8208;Synuclein (&#945;&#8208;Synuclein) is a 140 amino acid protein implicated in neurodegenerative disorders known as synucleino&#8208;pathies, where it accumulates in proteinaceous inclusions in the brain. The normal physiological function of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein remains obscure, as it exists in several non&#8208;neuronal cells in which its function has not been studied. Given the tremendous interest in studying &#945;&#8208;Synuclein, and the existing limitations in the production of modified forms of the protein, we developed a method for the chemical synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein by combining peptide fragment synthesis via automated microwave&#8208;assisted solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis and ligation strategies. Our synthetic pathway enables the synthesis of protein variants of interest, carrying either mutations or posttranslational modifications, for further investigations of the effects on the structure and aggregation behavior of the protein. Ultimately, our study forms the foundation for future syntheses and studies of other custom&#8208;made &#945;&#8208;Synuclein variants with a single or several modifications, as necessary.</dc:description>

         <title>One, Two Three &#8211; Phosphaalkene Decoration Tailoring Solubility and Electronic Properties of Truxene&#8208;Based Electron Acceptors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the functionalization and deplanarization of truxenes using pnictaalkene fragments. Selective introduction of one, two, or three Mes*&#8208;Pn fragments provides up to three fully reversible reductions based on the Pn=C fragments. The incorporation of the unsaturated heteroelement fragment as well as the contortion of the truxene core result in significantly red&#8208;shifted absorption spectra and interesting opto&#8208;electronic properties which are studied by electrochemistry and spectro&#8208;electrochemistry. Incorporation of arsaalkene (As=C) motifs gives significantly milder reduction potentials and red&#8208;shifted absorption, while phosphaalkene decorated truxene P3 can be functionalized using Au(I)Cl coordination. Furthermore, solubility is markedly increased upon incorporation of the Pn&#8208;Mes* fragments which renders these materials suitable for solution processing.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe an operationally simple and user&#8208;friendly protocol that allows the site&#8209;selective hydrogenation and deuteration of di&#8208;, tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted benzylic olefins by electroreduction while other groups prone to hydrogenation are present. The radical anionic intermediates react with the most inexpensive hydrogen/deuterium source H2O/D2O. Our method overcomes many limitations that arise from previously reported electro&#173;reductive hydrogenations. The applicability of this reaction is demonstrated by a broad substrate scope (&gt;50 examples) that focuses on functional group tolerance and sites that are affected by metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation (alkenes, alkynes, protecting groups).</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the Lewis Acidity and Reactivity of Neutral Pentacoordinate&#160;Dithienophospholes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of luminescent, neutral pentacoordinate dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;d]phosphole compounds was synthesized by [4+1] cycloaddition of o&#8208;quinones with the trivalent corresponding phospholes. The electronic and geometrical modification of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated scaffold implemented here impacts the aggregation behavior of the species in solution. It proved successful in generating species with improved Lewis acidity of the phosphorus center that was then leveraged for small&#8208;molecule activation. Hydride abstraction from an external substrate involving the hypervalent species is followed by an intriguing P&#8208;mediated umpolung from the hydride to a proton and supports the catalytic potential of this class of main&#8208;group Lewis acids for organic chemistry. This study is a comprehensive investigation into various methods, including electronic, chemical, geometric modifications (and sometimes combinations of these approaches) to systematically improve the Lewis acidity of neutral and stable main&#8208;group Lewis acids with practical value for a range of chemical transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Promoting Plasmonic Hot Hole Extraction and Photothermal Effect for Oxygen Evolution Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boosting oxygen evolution reaction by local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) provides breakthrough opportunities for the promotion of solar energy conversion.The potential of LSPR&#160;has rarely been tapped and investigated. Here, we report the precise regulation of commercial Au nanoparticles&#160;plasmonic nanomaterial and OER electrocatalysts,&#160;viz., the NiCoOx&#160;electrocatalytic layer with hole transport ability and photothermal effect is prepared on the surface of Au nanoparticles by photoelectrodeposition. The NiCoOx&#160;layer not only increases the transmission distance of holes generated by plasmonic Au nanoparticles, but also reduce&#160;the agglomeration of plasmonic Au nanoparticles during long&#8208;time OER reaction, which greatly improves the OER catalytic ability. The current density of NiCoOx/Au anode&#160;is about 6.5&#160;times of pristine NiCoOx&#160;anode&#160;and 47 times of pristine Au anode&#160;at 2.0 V versus RHE.&#160;More importantly, with the LSPR and photothermal effect, the NiCoOx/Au anode provides additional current density of 7.01&#160;mA cm&#8208;2&#160;after illumination,&#160;and maintains no attenuation for more than 2000&#160;s. Benefiting from&#160;the solution of agglomeration problem of Au nanoparticles in the long&#8208;time OER process and the effective utilization of generated holes of Au nanoparticles, this design can provide guidance for the application of plasmonic materials in the field of electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Can Copper(I) and Silver(I) be Hydrogen Bond Acceptors?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen bonding with metals has recently been shown to take place with gold(I) compound. With the help of gas&#8208;phase IR spectroscopy and computational chemistry, we show, that similar interactions should exist also with Silver and Copper, with equipped with suitably designed ligands.







Abstract
Gold(I) centers can form moderately strong (Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H) hydrogen bonds with tertiary ammonium groups, as has been demonstrated in the 3AuCl+ (3+=1&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)&#8208;3&#8208;phenyl&#8208;4&#8208;(2&#8208;((dimethylammonio)methyl)phenyl)&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;5&#8208;ylidene) complex. However, similar hydrogen bonding interactions with isoelectronic silver(I) or copper(I) centers are unknown. Herein, we first explored whether the Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H bond originally observed in 3AuCl+ can be strengthened by replacing Cl with Br or I. Experimental gas&#8208;phase IR spectra in the &#8764;3000&#8197;cm&#8722;1 region showed only a small effect of the halogen on the Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H bond. Next, we measured the spectra of 3AgCl+, which exhibited significant differences compared to its 3AuX+ counterparts. The difference has been explained by DFT calculations which indicated that the Ag&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H interaction is only marginal in this complex, and a Cl&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H hydrogen bond is formed instead. Calculations predicted the same for the 3CuCl+ complex. However, we noticed that for Ag and Cu complexes with less flexible ligands, such as dimethyl(2&#8208;(dimethylammonio)phenyl)phosphine (L7H+), the computations predict the presence of the respective Ag&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H and Cu&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H hydrogen bonds, with a strength similar to the Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H bond in 3AuCl+. We, therefore, propose possible complexes where the presence of (Ag/Cu)&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H bonds could be experimentally verified to broaden our understanding of these unusual interactions.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hydrogen bonding&lt;/b&gt; with metals has recently been shown to take place with gold(I) compound. With the help of gas-phase IR spectroscopy and computational chemistry, we show, that similar interactions should exist also with Silver and Copper, with equipped with suitably designed ligands.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold(I) centers can form moderately strong (Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H) hydrogen bonds with tertiary ammonium groups, as has been demonstrated in the &lt;b&gt;3AuCl&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

         <title>In Cellulo Light&#8208;Induced Dynamics in a BODIPY&#8208;Perylene Dyad</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
BODIPY&#8208;based donor&#8208;acceptor dyads are widely used as sensors and probes in life science. Their biophysical properties have been well investigated in solutions, in which the photochemical and photophysical properties of these BODIPY dyads vary significantly in different environments. However, their photophysical properties in cellulo are generally understood less. To address this issue, the photoinduced dynamics of BODIPY derivatives were elucidated in live human cancer cells using sub&#8208;ns time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy.







Abstract
BODIPY&#8208;based donor&#8208;acceptor dyads are widely used as sensors and probes in life science. Thus, their biophysical properties are well established in solution, while their photophysical properties in cellulo, i.&#8201;e., in the environment, in which the dyes are designed to function, are generally understood less. To address this issue, we present a sub&#8208;ns time&#8208;resolved transient absorption study of the excited&#8208;state dynamics of a BODIPY&#8208;perylene dyad designed as a twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) probe of the local viscosity in live cells.

         <title>Control over Dethreading Kinetics Allows Evaluating the Entropy Stored in an Interlocked Molecular Machine Out&#8208;of&#8208;Equilibrium
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A minimal model of an acid&#8208;base powered molecular machine is studied, gaining control on its dethreading kinetics by engineering its components. Leveraging solvent properties, we could monitor the relaxation of the molecular machine from a high energy state to equilibrium. By measuring the heat exchanged in this process, we could confirm experimentally that such systems have a significant entropy content.







Abstract
The operation of nanomachines is fundamentally different from that of their macroscopic counterparts. In particular, the role of solvent is critical yet rarely associated with machine functionality. Here, we study a minimal model of one of the most advanced molecular machines to gain control of its operation by engineering components and the employed solvent. Operation kinetics were changed over more than four orders of magnitude and could be modulated by solvent. Leveraging solvent properties, it was possible to monitor the relaxation of the molecular machine towards equilibrium and measure the heat exchanged in the process. Our work expands the capabilities of acid&#8208;base powered molecular machines, confirming experimentally that such systems have a dominant entropy content.

         <title>NHC&#8208;Stabilised Parent Tripentelyltrielanes</title>

Three times the fun! The synthesis and characterisation of NHC&#8208;stabilised parent tripentelyltrielanes IDipp &#8901; E(PnH2)3 (E=Al, Ga; Pn=P, As) and triphosphanylindiumane IDipp &#8901; In(PH2)3 are presented (IDipp=1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene), which were obtained by triple salt metathesis from IDipp &#8901; ECl3 and alkali metal pnictogenides. Coordination towards (HgC6F4)3 gave evidence of a first coordination compound.







Abstract
A missing family of the extremely air sensitive tripentelyltrielanes was discovered. Their stabilisation was achieved by using the bulky NHC IDipp (NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, IDipp=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene). The tripentelylgallanes and tripentelylalanes IDipp &#8901; Ga(PH2)3 (1&#8201;a), IDipp &#8901; Ga(AsH2)3 (1&#8201;b), IDipp &#8901; Al(PH2)3 (2&#8201;a) and IDipp &#8901; Al(AsH2)3 (2&#8201;b) were synthesised by salt metathesis of IDipp &#8901; ECl3 (E=Al, Ga, In) with alkali metal pnictogenides such as NaPH2/LiPH2 &#8901; DME and KAsH2, respectively. Moreover, the detection of the first NHC&#8208;stabilised tripentelylindiumane IDipp &#8901; In(PH2)3 (3) was possible by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy. Initial investigations of the coordination ability of these compounds resulted in the successful isolation of the coordination compound [IDipp &#8901; Ga(PH2)2(&#956;3&#8208;PH2{HgC6F4}3)] (4) by reaction of 1&#8201;a with (HgC6F4)3. The compounds were characterised by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy as well as single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. Supporting computational studies highlight the electronic features of the products.

         <title>Assessing Combinations of B(C6F5)3 and N2&#8208;Derived Molybdenum Nitrido Complexes for Heterolytic Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dinitrogen&#8208;derived nitrides have been explored as Lewis base component for frustrated Lewis pair type heterolytic bond splitting with B(C6F5)3 as the Lewis acid. d0 and d2 molybdenum nitrides both form stable adducts with B(C6F5)3. If Si&#8722;H bond splitting could be achieved, B&#8722;H bond activation of HB(C6F5)2 was not observed, this borane entering in competition with B(C6F5)3 to pair with the nitride without any further reactivity.







Abstract
Two different dinitrogen&#8208;derived molybdenum nitrido complexes varying by their geometry, ligand spheres and oxidations states were shown to engage their N ligand in dative bonding with the strong Lewis acid B(C6F5)3. The stable adducts were assessed for frustrated Lewis pair&#8208;type heterolytic E&#8722;H bond splitting of hydrosilanes (E=Si) and HB(C6F5)2. Whereas Si&#8722;H bond activation was achieved, HB(C6F5)2 was shown to substitute B(C6F5)3 in a quantitative or equilibrated fashion, depending on the nature of the nitrido complex.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dinitrogen-derived nitrides&lt;/b&gt; have been explored as Lewis base component for frustrated Lewis pair type heterolytic bond splitting with B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as the Lewis acid. d&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; and d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; molybdenum nitrides both form stable adducts with B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. If Si&#8722;H bond splitting could be achieved, B&#8722;H bond activation of HB(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was not observed, this borane entering in competition with B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to pair with the nitride without any further reactivity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two different dinitrogen-derived molybdenum nitrido complexes varying by their geometry, ligand spheres and oxidations states were shown to engage their N ligand in dative bonding with the strong Lewis acid B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The stable adducts were assessed for frustrated Lewis pair-type heterolytic E&#8722;H bond splitting of hydrosilanes (E=Si) and HB(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Whereas Si&#8722;H bond activation was achieved, HB(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was shown to substitute B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in a quantitative or equilibrated fashion, depending on the nature of the nitrido complex. No B&#8722;H bond splitting was observed. Thermodynamics of these reactions, computed by DFT, are in agreement with the experimental outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Tetraarylethylenes Enabled by Reductive anti&#8208;1,2&#8208;Dimetallation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed anti&#8208;1,2&#8208;diarylation of diarylacetylenes is described. The key intermediates, trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;dizincioalkenes, are prepared by sodium&#8208;promoted reductive anti&#8208;1,2&#8208;dimagnesiation of alkynes and the subsequent transmetallation to zinc. The present reaction enables the stereoselective synthesis of tetraarylethylenes which have been difficult to prepare according to the conventional methods.







Abstract
Tetraarylethylenes (TAEs) have been gaining attention from various scientific disciplines for their characteristic chemical and physical properties. From the synthetic perspective, however, efficient methods for the selective synthesis of different isomers of TAEs are still underdeveloped. Here, we report the regio&#8208; and stereoselective synthesis of TAEs by means of sodium&#8208;promoted reductive anti&#8208;1,2&#8208;dimagnesiation of alkynes. Subsequent transmetallation to zinc generates trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;dizincioalkenes, which underwent the stereoselective arylation under a palladium catalysis to afford a variety of TAEs that had been difficult to prepare according to the conventional procedures. In addition, the present method accommodates not only diarylacetylenes but also alkyl aryl acetylenes and thus enables to synthesize a wide range of all&#8208;carbon tetrasubstituted alkenes.

         <title>Controlling the Flexibility of Carbazole&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks by Substituent Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topological structures and properties of Cu&#8208;/Co&#8208;based MOFs with novel carbazole ligands are reported. The MOFs show high chemical stability, H2&#8208;adsorption performance, and CO2/N2 selectivity. The introduction of a strongly electron&#8208;donating substituent increases the structural robustness of the corresponding Cu&#8208;based MOFs. Thus, the flexibility of such MOFs can be controlled by the functional groups introduced at the periphery of the ligand backbone, which will serve as a new guideline for the design of advanced MOFs.







Abstract
We have developed highly porous Cu&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) using carbazole&#8208;type linkers. The novel topological structure of these MOFs was revealed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Molecular adsorption/desorption experiments indicated that these MOFs are flexible and change their structure upon adsorption/desorption of organic solvents and gas molecules. These MOFs exhibit unprecedented properties that allow controlling their flexibility by adding a functional group onto the central benzene ring of the organic ligand. For example, the introduction of electron&#8208;donating substituents increases the robustness of the resulting MOFs. These MOFs also exhibit flexibility&#8208;dependent differences in gas&#8208;adsorption and &#8208;separation performance. Thus, this study represents the first example of controlling the flexibility of MOFs with the same topological structure via the substituent effect of functional groups introduced into the organic ligand.

         <title>Unexpectedly Large Structural Variations in Benzyl&#8208;Substituted Sila[1]ferrocenophanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four related silicon&#8208;bridged [1]ferrocenophanes show large variations of the tilting of Cp rings in the crystal lattice. While the measured tilt angles range from 16.6 to 21.5&#176;, calculated values range from 19.6 to 20.8&#176;. With the help of DFT calculations, the unexpected experimental results are rationalized and placed into the contexts of known outliers of the sila[1]ferrocenophane family.







Abstract
A set of four planar&#8208;chiral sila[1]ferrocenophanes equipped with a benzyl group in the &#945;&#8208;position, either on one or both Cp rings, and substituted on the bridging silicon atom, either by methyl or phenyl groups, were prepared. While NMR, UV/Vis, and DSC measurements did not show anything uncommon, single crystal X&#8208;ray analyses revealed unexpectedly large variations of the dihedral angles between both Cp rings (&#945; tilt angle). While DFT calculations predicted &#945; between 19.6 and 20.8&#176;, measured values were found between 16.6(2) and 21.45(14)&#176;. However, experimentally determined conformers differ significantly from those calculated for the gas phase. For the sila[1]ferrocenophane with the largest mismatch between the experimental and predicted &#945; angle, it was shown that the orientation of benzyl groups have a significant influence on the ring&#8208;tilted structure. Packing of molecules in the crystal lattice forces benzyl groups into unusual orientations, resulting in a significantly reduced &#945; angle through steric repulsions.

         <title>Static Binding and Dynamic Transporting&#8208;Based Design of Specific Ring&#8208;Chain&#8208;Ring Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitor: From Galantamine to Natural Product</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The current theoretical&#8208;experimental work identifies hotspots for galantamine release and the most favourable transport mechanism. The compound with &#8220;ring&#8208;chain&#8208;ring&#8221; framework with detail beneficial modify scheme is summarized, which may improve the residence time of inhibitor in AChE. Based on dictamnine, three novel eligible derivatives are developed, which verifies the prediction. The present work provides a train of thought from static and dynamic view to modify or design appropriate inhibitor on the basis of specific binding and transportation features.







Abstract
Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is a key target for the current symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease, and galantamine is a clinical anticholinesterase drug with transiently acting characteristic and good selectivity for AChE. The present theoretical&#8208;experimental work improves the drug&#8216;s residence time without reducing the inhibition effect, thus providing a crucial breakthrough for modifying the inhibitor of AChE with better kinetic behavior. The static binding and dynamic delivery properties acquired from atomic view reveal that the galantamine simply occupies a catalytic anionic site, and its release from AChE needs only &#8764;8.6&#8197;kcal/mol. Both of these may cause the short residence time of galantamine. The hotspots and most favorable transport mechanism are identified, and the hydrogen bond and aromatic stacking interactions are observed to play crucial roles for galantamine binding and release in AChE. The typical peripheral anionic site arisen at the delivery process would provide another key occupation to enhance the anti&#8208;release ability for inhibitors. The compound with &#8220;specific&#8208;ring&#8208;chain&#8208;ring&#8221; framework with detailed beneficial modification scheme is summarized, which may improve the residence time of the inhibitor in AChE. The thermodynamic and dynamic properties of galantamine derivatives are also studied. Based on dictamnine, a natural alkaloid, two novel eligible derivatives are designed, synthesized and evaluated, which verifies our prediction. Multiple computational approaches and experimental combinations probably provide a train of thought from both static and dynamic views to modify or design appropriate inhibitors on the basis of specific binding and transportation features.

         <title>Comprehensive Investigation of Anion Species in Crystalline Li+ ion Conductor Li27&#8722;x[P4O7+xN9&#8722;x]O3 (x&#8776;1.9(3))</title>

         <dc:description>
The structure of the crystalline lithium oxonitridophosphate Li27&#8722;x[P4O7+xN9&#8722;x]O3 contains three different anions, namely [PO2N2]5&#8722;, [PO3N]4&#8722;, and O2&#8722;. It was comprehensively investigated by single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, neutron powder diffraction, NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. A total ionic conductivity of 6.6&#215;10&#8722;8&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1, which is similar to that of amorphous a&#8208;LiPON was determined with impedance spectroscopy.







Abstract
The Li+ ion conductor Li27&#8722;x[P4O7+xN9&#8722;x]O3 (x&#8776;1.9) has been synthesized from P3N5, Li3N and Li2O in a Ta ampoule at 800&#8201;&#176;C under Ar atmosphere. The cubic compound crystallizes in space group I
3d with a=12.0106(14) &#197; and Z=4. It contains both non&#8208;condensed [PO2N2]5&#8722; and [PO3N]4&#8722; tetrahedra as well as O2&#8722; ions, surrounded by Li+ ions. Charge neutrality is achieved by partial occupancy of Li positions, which was refined with neutron powder diffraction data. Measurements of the partial ionic and electronic conductivity show a total ionic conductivity of 6.6&#215;10&#8722;8&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 with an activation energy of 0.46&#177;0.02&#8197;eV and a bulk ionic conductivity of 4&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C, which is close to the ionic conductivity of amorphous lithium nitridophosphate. This makes Li27&#8722;x[P4O7+xN9&#8722;x]O3 an interesting candidate for investigation of structural factors affecting ionic conductivity in lithium oxonitridophosphates.

         <title>Extending the Palette of Green Coumarin Photocages &#8211; Oligonucleotide Fragmentation and Superior 5&#8217;&#8208;Caps</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We extend the possibilities of dicyanocoumarin (DCCM)&#8208;modified oligonucleotides to not just allow their release and therefore activation with green light (OFF &#8594; ON) but to also now offer a solution for their fragmentation after exposure to green light (ON &#8594; OFF). We further give an answer to the decreasing uncaging quantum yields often faced when working with red&#8208;shifted photocages and showed that rigidified DCCM 5&#8217;&#8208;caps outperform their predecessors. Those two new 5&#8217;&#8208;caps with ATTO 390 motif or julolidine core are compatible with copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloadditions (CuAACs) and therefore suitable for efficient caging through cyclization or for more bioconjugation reactions. Due to their planarization, they even experience an additional red&#8208;shift which is important for their use in biological applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Semihydrogenation of Urea Derivatives to Formamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The utilization of CO2 as a non&#8208;toxic and cheap feedstock for C1 is a desirable route to achieve high value&#8208;added chemicals. In this context, we report a highly efficient ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed semihydrogenation reaction of CO2&#8208;derived ureas. Various alkyl and aryl urea derivatives were successfully hydrogenated to obtain the corresponding recyclable amines and formamides (up to 97% yield), highlighting the good substrate applicability of this method, which makes this method a sustainable alternative for the hydrogenation of CO2 to formamides in the presence of amines. In the meantime, we discover a new pathway that enables rapid hydrogenation of urea derivatives even at lower H2 pressure (&lt; 5 bar). This methodology might provide a new insight into the reduction functionalization of CO2 under mild pressure to form new C&#8208;N bond. Based on the control experiments and the observed intermediate products, we clarify the mechanism for selective semi&#8208;hydrogenation of ureas.</dc:description>

         <title>Linkage Chemistry of SuFEx Linkers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfur(VI)&#8208;fluoride exchange linkage as a next generation of click chemistry was introduced by Sharpless et al. in 2014. Distinguished from CuAAC, the SuFEx reaction proceeds under metal&#8208;free conditions, and the reactive linkers are variable, enabling access to a diverse class of linkage compounds. Therein, a series of SuFEx linkers emerged has been widely prevalent in diverse fields. The SVI&#8208;F bond in comparison to SVI&#8208;Cl bond features excellent stability and chemoselectivity. The linkage chemistry primarily involves the formation of S&#8208;O and S&#8208;N bonds via commercially available phenols and amines, yet less study on C&#8208;SuFEx linkage. This review will focus on three types of linkage for SuFEx linkers comprising S&#8208;O, S&#8208;N, and S&#8208;C bonds, and we hope to provide a practical guidance for SuFEx linkage chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>A Bioactive Synthetic Outer&#8208;Core Oligosaccharide Derived from a Klebsiella pneumonia Lipopolysaccharide for Bacteria Recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemical synthesised outer core tetra&#8208; and pentasaccharide derived from the lipopolysaccharide of K. pneumoniae conjugated to the carrier proteins CRM197 and BSA elicited in mice antibodies that recognized isolated LPS as well as various strains of K. pneumoniae demonstrating they can induce relevant antigenic responses.







Abstract
There is an urgent need for new treatment options for carbapenem&#8208;resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae), which is a common cause of life&#8208;threatening hospital&#8208; and community&#8208;acquired infections. Prophylactic or therapeutic vaccination may offer an approach to control these infections, however, none has yet been approved for human use. Here, we report the chemical synthesis of an outer core tetra&#8208; and pentasaccharide derived from the lipopolysaccharide of K. pneumoniae. The oligosaccharides were equipped with an aminopentyl linker, which facilitated conjugation to the carrier proteins CRM197 and BSA. Mice immunized with the glycoconjugate vaccine candidates elicited antibodies that recognized isolated LPS as well as various strains of K. pneumoniae. The successful preparation of the oligosaccharides relied on the selection of monosaccharide building blocks equipped with orthogonal hydroxyl and amino protecting groups. It allowed the differentiation of three types of amines of the target compounds and the installation of a crowded 4,5&#8208;branched Kdo moiety.

         <title>A Template&#8208;free Pd2L4 Cage with up to Nanomolar Affinity for Chloride in Aqueous Solutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective binding of chloride over other most abundant anions in living organisms is pivotal due to its essential role in physiological functions. Herein we report a template&#8208;free Pd2L4 cage exhibiting high selectivity for medium&#8208;sized halides (i.e., Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;) in water owing to the size&#8208;discriminatory nature of the cage cavity. In pure water, this cage displays high selectivity, and micromolar affinity for chloride. The cage shows no binding towards other biologically more abundant essential anions such as phosphates, carboxylates, and bicarbonate. This cage shows an unprecedented nanomolar affinity with 1:1 binding stoichiometry for chloride in aqueous&#8208;DMSO media. This high affinity was achieved with the best use of traditional hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions as confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. This well&#8208;defined cage sequestrates F&#8722; by cleaving B&#8722;F bond from BF4&#8722; in a facile manner in non&#8208;polar solvent media or in the presence of excess ligand. This cage also demonstrates sub&#8208;ppm level chloride capture that is present in commercial D2O samples.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>2&#8208;Methylisoborneol is a widespread musty odourant that is produced by many bacteria including actinomycetes, cyanobacteria and myxobacteria. Two 2&#8208;methylisoborneol synthases (MIBS) that are phylogenetically distant to the known enzyme from Streptomyces coelicolor were found to be highly active for 2&#8208;methylisoborneol biosynthesis. Based on the enzyme structure and on an amino acid sequence alignment, the MIBS from S. coelicolor was extensively studied through site&#8208;directed mutagenesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring Zr&#8208;based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks as Smart Electrochromic Sensors by Coordination&#8208;Driven Surface Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As emerging stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, electrochromic metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are still not utilized in sensing applications due to difficulties in water stability, facile synthesis and functionalization, and efficient translation of specific recognition events. Here, we firstly find that a Zr&#8208;based MOF furnished with postsynthetically created viologen&#8208;like electron&#8208;deficient moiety was electrochromic active. With a coordination&#8208;driven surface engineering strategy where phosphate&#8208;containing biomolecules are tethered to Zr nodes of the MOF, fine tuning the interface electron transfer was readily achieved, thus benefitting for constructing smart electrochromic sensors through the combination of the sensitivity of electrochemistry with the visuality of colorimetry. Particularly, MOF&#8208;coated conductive films enabled label&#8208;free detection of phosphoproteins, and aptamer&#8208;functionalized ones responded specifically to the target. In two cases distinct color changes allow for visual quantification. This study represents the first example of MOF&#8208;based electrochromic sensors developed by an efficient strategy, indicating the generality to electrochromic counterparts for various sensing applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereochemical Control of Secondary Benzamide&#8208;based BODIPY Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aromatic amides can be used to construct light&#8208;harvesting materials with valuable optical properties. The amide bond is formed using well&#8208;known coupling agents in near quantitative yield, as illustrated here through the synthesis of two boron dipyrromethene derivatives bearing an amide linkage. The primary concern with acyl amides is rotation around the C&#8208;N bond, leading to cis and trans isomers. Using NMR spectroscopy, quantum chemical calculations and critical comparison to simpler benzamides, the stereochemistry of the target compounds has been addressed. The N&#8208;cyclohexyl derivative gave diffraction quality crystals that established a trans geometry for the amide bond. Quantum chemical calculations support the trans geometry as being the lowest&#8208;energy structure in solution but indicate that inversion of the aryl ring is an important structural feature. Indeed, rotation around the C(sp2)&#8208;C(aryl) bond has a strong influence on the solution&#8208;phase NMR spectra. The amide connection has minimal effect on the photophysical properties.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We studied the impact of achiral substituents on the chiral supramolecular architectures of diketopyrrolo[3,4&#8208;c]pyrrole&#8211;1,2,3&#8208;1H&#8208;triazole (DPP) dyes. We decorated the same chiral DPP motif with substituent groups on the nitrogen atoms of the lactam moiety: the hydrophobic n&#8208;octyl alkyl chain, the hydrophilic triethylene glycol (TEG) chain and the thermo&#8208;cleavable t&#8208;butoxycarbonyl (t&#8208;Boc) carbamate group. In spite of identical conjugated chromophore and chiral appendage, in aggregated form the three dyes displayed profoundly different optical, chiroptical, electrochemical and thermal features. ECD measurements revealed differences in the aggregation modes, which would be inaccessible by most other techniques. We found strong chiroptical features, which would have major implications in the context of chiral organic opto&#8208;electronics and in the development of other highly innovative technological applications.</dc:description>

         <title>X&#8208;Ray Study of Cembranoids with Flexible Rings from&#160;Boswellia papyrifera&#160;Resins Allowing Structural Revisions of Misleading Structures in the Past 70 Years</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>30 new highly oxygenated and stereogenic 14&#8208;membered macrocyclic diterpenoids, papyrifuranols A&#8722;Z (1&#8722;26) and AA&#8722;AD (27&#8722;30), and 8 known analogs were isolated from Boswellia papyrifera resins. All the structures were characterized by detailed spectral analyses, quantum calculations, X&#8208;ray diffraction, and modified Mosher&#8217;s methods. Notably, six previously reported structures were revised. Our study points out misleading factors of macrocyclic cembranoids (CBs) representation in the past 7 decades by analysis of 25 X&#8208;ray structures, lending a hand for innately challengeable structure identification of such flexible macrocyclic CBs and avoiding following the tracks of an overturned cart during future structure characterization and total synthesis. Biosynthetic conversions of all the isolates were proposed and wound healing bioassays reveal that papyrifuranols N&#8722;P could significantly stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Paramagnetic Relaxation Agents for Enhancing Temporal Resolution and Sensitivity in Multinuclear FlowNMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sensitivity in FlowNMR spectroscopy for reaction monitoring often suffers from low levels of pre&#8208;magnetisation due to limited residence time of the sample in the magnetic field. While this in&#8208;flow effect is tolerable for high sensitivity nuclei such as 1H and 19F, it significantly reduces the signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio in 31P and 13C spectra, making FlowNMR impractical especially at low analyte concentrations. Paramagnetic relaxation agents (PRAs), which enhance polarisation and spin&#8208;lattice relaxation, could eliminate the adverse in&#8208;flow effect and improve the signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. Here, we investigate [Co(acac)3], [Mn(acac)3], [Fe(acac)3], [Cr(acac)3], [Ni(acac)2]3, [Gd(tmhd)3] and [Cr(tmhd)3] for their effectiveness in improving signal intensity per unit time in FlowNMR applications under the additional constraint of chemical inertness towards catalytically active transition metal complexes. High&#8208;spin Cr(III)acetylacetonates emerged as the most effective compounds successfully reducing 31P T1 values four&#8208; to five&#8208;fold at concentrations as low as 10 mM without causing adverse line broadening. Whereas [Cr(acac)3] showed signs of chemical reactivity with a mixture of triphenylphosphine, triphenylphosphine oxide and triphenylphosphate over the course of several hours at 80&#176; C, the bulkier [Cr(tmhd)3] was stable and equally effective as a PRA under these conditions.</dc:description>

Whereas [Cr(acac)3] showed signs of chemical reactivity with a mixture of triphenylphosphine, triphenylphosphine oxide and triphenylphosphate over the course of several hours at 80&#176; C, the bulkier [Cr(tmhd)3] was stable and equally effective as a PRA under these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Access to Benzo&#8208; and Naphtho&#8208;Azaphospholes via C&#8211;H Bond Activation of Aryl&#8208;Substituted Isonitriles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Differently substituted phenyl isonitriles (with C&#8211;H bonds in ortho&#8208;position) and naphthyl isonitriles were reacted with the cyclic biradical [&#8226;P(&#181;&#8208;N&#8208;Ter)2P&#8226;] (1). Insertion of the isonitrile formed a cyclic five&#8208;membered biradical [&#8226;P(NTer)2C(R)P&#8226;] (2R, R = phenyl, napthyl) in the first step, followed by C&#8211;H activation at the aryl substituent, resulting in novel azaphospholes (5R), which could be isolated and fully characterized. The formation of the azaphospholes can be prevented by the addition of a second equivalent of isonitrile, which causes the blocking of the radical centers in 2R by adduct formation (3R). Quantum mechanical calculations showed that a significant increase in the aromaticity of the benzo&#8208; and naphtho&#8208;azaphospholes is one of the driving forces for the activation process leading to the formation of thermodynamically favored azaphospholes. Targeted activation of C&#8211;H bonds using biradical systems represents a new synthetic approach to generate benzo&#8208; and naphtho&#8208;azaphospholes.</dc:description>

         <title>Better Peptides via Chemical Glycosylation: Somatostatin Analogues Having a Human Complex&#8208;Type N&#8208;Glycan with Improved Drug Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Somatostatin (somatotropin release&#8208;inhibiting factor, SRIF) is a growth hormone inhibitory factor in the form of a 14&#8208; or 28&#8208;amino acid peptide. SRIF affects several physiological functions through its action on five distinct SRIF receptor subtypes (sst1&#8208;5). Native SRIF has only limited clinical applications due to its rapid degradation in plasma. To overcome this obstacle, we have developed glycosylated SRIF analogues that possess not only metabolic stability but also high affinity to all five receptor subtypes by attaching human complex&#8208;type oligosaccharides. Such glycosylated SRIF analogues with improved pharmacokinetic profiles could be potent and novel therapeutic drugs for SRIF&#8208;related diseases in which several SRIF receptor subtypes are closely involved, and also shed light on new indications. Our results show that chemical glycosylation can be a powerful tool for the development of peptide and protein analogues superior to the original molecules with enhanced drug properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Amino&#8208;Acid Based Chiral Trisubstituted Benzimidazole Supramolecules: Synthesis and Self&#8208;Assembling Behavior</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Trisubstituted 1,3,5&#8208;tri(benzimidazolyl)benzene derivatives were synthesized from &#671;&#8208;alanine, &#671;&#8208;valine, &#7429;&#8208;valine and glycine, and their self&#8208;assembling behavior and stimuli&#8208;response in solution and gel states were evaluated. Circular dichroism/UV&#8211;vis absorption spectroscopic and dynamic light scattering measurements revealed that the compounds formed H&#8208;aggregates via intramolecular hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions in nonpolar solvents such as CHCl3, whereas collapse of the aggregates was confirmed by MeOH addition. Quantum mechanical calculations and molecular dynamics simulations also supported aggregation in CHCl3. Rheological analysis and morphology observation revealed the formation of a fibril like structure by further assembling of aggregates at a high concentration in CHCl3.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetraphenylethene&#8208;based cis/trans isomers for targeted fluorescence sensing and biomedical applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular probes which can be modulated, functionalized and used to visualize the processes are highly desirable for understanding and manipulating biological systems. Geometric cis and trans isomers of tetraphenylethene (TPE) emerge as attractive candidates to fulfill these tasks thanks to the unique aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties, tailorable structures, and responsiveness to external stimuli. This minireview focuses on cis and trans isomers of TPE derivatives that are functionalized with molecular recognition units for fluorescence detection, bioimaging and cancer therapy. The effects of molecular geometry on fluorescence property, target binding ability and biological activity are summarized. The feasibility to in vitro and in vivo switch molecular configuration and thus bio&#8208;activity is discussed. Finally, the future development and challenges are discussed in view of TPE&#8208;based stereoisomers for targeted sensing and imaging&#8208;guided modulation of biological processes.</dc:description>
