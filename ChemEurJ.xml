         <title>Benzoselenadiazole&#8208;Functionalized H&#8208;bonded Arylamide Foldamers: Solvent&#8208;Responsive Properties and Helix Self&#8208;Assembly Directed by Chalcogen Bonding in Solid State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, a series of H&#8208;bonded arylamide foldamers bearing benzoselenadiazole ends with solvent&#8208;responsive properties have been synthesized. In dichloromethane or dimethyl sulfoxide solvents, the molecules exhibit meniscus or linear structures, respectively, which can be attributed to the unique intramolecular hydrogen bonding behavior evidenced by 1D 1H NMR and 2D NOESY spectra. UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy experiments show that the absorption wavelength of H&#8208;bonded arylamide foldamers are significantly red&#8208;shifted due to the presence of benzoselenadiazole group. In addition, the crystal structures reveal that effective intermolecular dual Se&#183;&#183;&#183;N interactions between benzoselenadiazole groups induce further assembly of the monomers. Remarkably, supramolecular linear and double helices structures are constructed under the synergistic induction of intramolecular hydrogen bonding and intermolecular chalcogen bonding. Additionally, 2D DOSY diffusion spectra and theoretical modelling based on density functional theory (DFT) are performed to explore the persistence of intermolecular Se&#183;&#183;&#183;N interactions beyond the crystalline state.</dc:description>

         <title>Calcium&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework: Detection and Idiosyncratic Removal of Copper by Nano&#8208;particle Deposition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel calcium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (CaMOF@LSB) was designed and synthesized, exhibiting dual functionality for both selective detection and removal of Cu2+ ions from aqueous solutions. The framework's stability, including solvent and pH variations, was established with notable thermal resilience. Colorimetric Cu2+ detection (&#8805; 5 ppm) with a high capture capacity of 484.2 mg g&#8208;1 by CaMOF@LSB places this material among the few that ensure efficient colorimetric detection and high removal capabilities of Cu2+ ions. Batch adsorption experiments revealed pH&#8208;dependent behavior and competitive interactions. Langmuir and pseudo&#8208;second&#8208;order kinetics models aptly described adsorption isotherms and kinetics, respectively. Thermodynamic assessments confirmed spontaneous and endothermic adsorption. Mechanistically, nanoparticle deposition contributes to the Cu2+ uptake. CaMOF@LSB also exhibited one of the best removal behaviour of Cu2+ by means of oxide formation on the surface. Regeneration of CaMOF@LSB was achieved by simple sonication in 0.1 M aqueous NaOH solution. &#160;The recyclability was also tested up to 5 cycles, and it exhibited a small decrease in adsorption capacity observed across the cycles. This research presents a promising avenue for addressing heavy metal pollution using metal&#8208;organic frameworks, thereby offering potential applications in water purification and environmental pollution monitoring and remediation.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective Dearomatizing Cyclizations of 5&#8208;Arylpentan&#8208;2&#8208;ones by Samarium Diiodide &#8211; A Computational Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT calculations including all f&#8208;electrons of samarium allowed a detailed mechanistic analysis of the synthetically valuable reductive cyclizations of 5&#8208;arylpentan&#8208;2&#8208;ones with samarium diiodide to bicyclic products. Details of the crucial electron&#8208;transfer processes, the diastereoselectivity, the regioselectivity and the influence of HMPA as ligand were correctly predicted.







Abstract
This study analyzes the samarium diiodide&#8208;promoted cyclizations of 5&#8208;arylpentan&#8208;2&#8208;ones to dearomatized bicyclic products utilizing density functional theory. The reaction involves a single electron transfer to the carbonyl group, which occurs synchronously with the rate determining cyclization event, and a second subsequent proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer. These redox reactions are accurately computed employing small core pseudo potentials explicitly involving all f&#8208;electrons of samarium. Comparison of the energies of the possible final products rules out thermodynamic control of the observed regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities. Kinetic control via appropriate transition states is correctly predicted, but to obtain reasonable energy levels the influence of the co&#8208;solvent hexamethylphosphortriamide has to be estimated by using a correction term. The steric effect of the bulky samarium ligands is decisive for the observed stereoselectivity. Carbonyl groups in para&#8208;position of the aryl group change the regioselectivity of the cyclization and lead to spiro compounds. The computations suggest again kinetic control of this deviating outcome. However, the standard mechanism has to be modified and the involvement of a complex activated by two SmI2 moieties is proposed in which two electrons are transferred simultaneously to form the new C&#8722;C bond. Computation of model intermediates show the feasibility of this alternative+ mechanism.

         <title>Hollow UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 encapsulated Pd catalysts for highly selective   hydrogenation of furfural  to furfuryl alcohol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective hydrogenation of furfural (FFA) to furfuryl alcohol (FA) is regarded as attractive transformation to achieve the sustainable synthesis of value&#8208;added chemicals from biomass resources. However, the conventional supported catalysts are significantly restricted by their narrow pore size, ununiform dispersion and easy leaching or aggregation of catalytic sites. Herein, we designed hollow UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2&#160;as the support to encapsulate Pd nanoparticles (Pd@H&#8208;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2) to achieve the highly active and selective conversion of FFA to FA. Benefiting from the void&#8208;confinement effect and substrate enrichment of hollow structure, as well as the surface wrinkles, the as&#8208;prepared catalyst Pd@H&#8208;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2&#160;exhibited 96.8 % conversion of FFA with satisfactory selectivity reaching up to 92.4 % at 80 &#176;C, 0.5 MPa H2&#160;in isopropanol solvent within 6 h. More importantly, as&#8208;prepared Pd@H&#8208;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2&#160;catalyst exhibited excellent long&#8208;term stability, as well as good universality toward a series of hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The selective hydrogenation of furfural (FFA) to furfuryl alcohol (FA) is regarded as attractive transformation to achieve the sustainable synthesis of value-added chemicals from biomass resources. However, the conventional supported catalysts are significantly restricted by their narrow pore size, ununiform dispersion and easy leaching or aggregation of catalytic sites. Herein, we designed hollow UiO-66-NH2&#160;as the support to encapsulate Pd nanoparticles (Pd@H-UiO-66-NH2) to achieve the highly active and selective conversion of FFA to FA. Benefiting from the void-confinement effect and substrate enrichment of hollow structure, as well as the surface wrinkles, the as-prepared catalyst Pd@H-UiO-66-NH2&#160;exhibited 96.8 % conversion of FFA with satisfactory selectivity reaching up to 92.4 % at 80 &#176;C, 0.5 MPa H2&#160;in isopropanol solvent within 6 h. More importantly, as-prepared Pd@H-UiO-66-NH2&#160;catalyst exhibited excellent long-term stability, as well as good universality toward a series of hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Magnesium Binding Site And The Anomeric Effect Regulate The Abiotic Redox Chemistry Of Nicotinamide Nucleotides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is a redox active molecule that is universally found in biology. Despite the importance and simplicity of this molecule, few reports exist that investigate which molecular features are important for the activity of this ribodinucleotide. By exploiting the nonenzymatic reduction and oxidation of NAD+ by pyruvate and methylene blue, respectively, we were able to identify key molecular features necessary for the intrinsic activity of NAD+ through kinetic analysis. Such features may explain how NAD+ could have been selected early during the emergence of life. Simpler molecules, such as nicotinamide, that lack an anomeric carbon are incapable of accepting electrons from pyruvate. The phosphate moiety inhibits activity in the absence of metal ions but facilitates activity at physiological pH and model prebiotic conditions by recruiting catalytic Mg2+. Reduction proceeds through consecutive single electron transfer events. Of the derivatives tested, including nicotinamide mononucleotide, nicotinamide riboside, 3&#8208;(aminocarbonyl)&#8208;1&#8208;(2,3&#8208;dihydroxypropyl)pyridinium, 1&#8208;methylnicotinamide, and nicotinamide, only NAD+ and nicotinamide mononucleotide would be capable of efficiently accepting and donating electrons from and to pyruvate within a nonenzymatic electron transport chain. The data are consistent with early metabolic chemistry exploiting NAD+ or nicotinamide mononucleotide and not simpler molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploration of Vitamin B6&#8208;Based Redox&#8208;Active Pyridinium Salts towards the Application in Aqueous Organic Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyridoxal hydrochloride, a vitamin B6 vitamer, was synthetically converted to a series of diverse redox&#8208;active benzoyl pyridinium salts. Cyclic voltammetry studies demonstrated redox reversibility under basic conditions, and two of the most promising salts were subjected to laboratory&#8208;scale redox flow battery tests involving galvanostatic cycling at 10 mM in 0.1 M NaOH. In these tests, the battery was charged completely, corresponding to the transfer of two electrons to the electrolyte, but no discharge was observed. Both CV analysis and electrochemical simulations confirmed that the redox wave observed in the experimental voltammograms corresponds to a two&#8208;electron process. To explain the irreversibility in the battery tests, we conducted bulk electrolysis with the benzoyl pyridinium salts, affording the corresponding benzylic secondary alcohols. Computational studies suggest that the reduction proceeds in three consecutive steps: first electron transfer (ET), then proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) and finally proton transfer (PT) to give the secondary alcohol. 1H NMR deuterium exchange studies indicated that the last PT step is not reversible in 0.1 M NaOH, rendering the entire redox process irreversible. The apparent reversibility observed in CV at the basic media likely arises from the slow rate of the PT step at the timescale of the measurement.</dc:description>

         <title>Conductive Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Grown on the Nickel&#8208;Based Hydroxide to Realize High&#8208;Performance Electrochemical Glucose Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To improve glucose detection, a series of Ni(OH)2@NiCo&#8208;HHTP and NiM&#8208;LDH@Ni&#8208;HHTP (M=Co2+, Mn2+, Cu2+, LDH=layered double hydroxide, HHTP=2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene) are successfully synthesized. We explored the dosage and the synergistic effect of bimetals on the grown of nanomaterials as well as the electrochemical sensing performance. As a result, NiCu&#8208;LDH@Ni&#8208;HHTP showed the best excellent glucose detection sensitivity.







Abstract
Glucose holds significant importance in disease diagnosis as well as beverage quality monitoring. The high&#8208;efficiency electrochemical sensor plays a crucial role in the electrochemical conversion technology. Ni(OH)2 nanosheets are provided with high specific surface area and redox activity that are widely used in electrochemistry. Conductive metal&#8208;organic frameworks (cMOFs) perfectly combine the structural controllability of organic materials with the long&#8208;range ordering of inorganic materials that possess the characteristic of high electron mobility. Based on the above considerations, the combination of Ni(OH)2 and Ni&#8208;HHTP (HHTP=2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene) as an electrode modification material is designed to enhance electrochemical performance. In this work, to improve glucose detection, a sequence of Ni(OH)2@NiCo&#8208;HHTP and NiM&#8208;LDH@Ni&#8208;HHTP (M=Co2+, Mn2+, Cu2+, LDH=layered double hydroxide) are successfully synthesised by doping metals into Ni&#8208;HHTP and Ni(OH)2, respectively. As a result, NiCu&#8208;LDH@Ni&#8208;HHTP showed the best excellent glucose detection sensitivity.

         <title>In Situ Detection of Nucleic Acids in Extracellular Vesicles via Membrane Fusion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept summarizes recent advancements in detecting extracellular vesicle (EV) nucleic acids via membrane fusion. These approaches mainly are classified into 1) universal and 2) targeted membrane fusion approaches, and their mechanisms, applications in biomedical diagnostics and the challenges and opportunities are discussed.







Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) carry diverse biomolecules (e.&#8201;g., nucleic acids, proteins) for intercellular communication, serving as important markers for diseases. Analyzing nucleic acids derived from EVs enables non&#8208;invasive disease diagnosis and prognosis evaluation. Membrane fusion, a fundamental cellular process wherein two lipid membranes merge, facilitates cell communication and cargo transport. Building on this natural phenomenon, recent years have witnessed the emergence of membrane fusion&#8208;based strategies for the detection of nucleic acids within EVs. These strategies entail the encapsulation of detection probes within either artificial or natural vesicles, followed by the induction of membrane fusion with EVs to deliver probes.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracellular vesicles (EVs) carry diverse biomolecules (e.&#8201;g., nucleic acids, proteins) for intercellular communication, serving as important markers for diseases. Analyzing nucleic acids derived from EVs enables non-invasive disease diagnosis and prognosis evaluation. Membrane fusion, a fundamental cellular process wherein two lipid membranes merge, facilitates cell communication and cargo transport. Building on this natural phenomenon, recent years have witnessed the emergence of membrane fusion-based strategies for the detection of nucleic acids within EVs. These strategies entail the encapsulation of detection probes within either artificial or natural vesicles, followed by the induction of membrane fusion with EVs to deliver probes. This innovative approach not only enables in&#8197;situ detection of nucleic acids within EVs but also ensures the maintenance of structural integrity of EVs, thus preventing nucleic acid degradation and minimizing the interference from free nucleic acids. This concept categorizes approaches into universal and targeted membrane fusion strategies, and discusses their application potential, and challenges and future prospects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stabilization of the Neutral [25]Hexaphyrin(1.0.1.0.1.0) Radical by Hetero&#8208;Bimetal&#8208;Coordination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hetero&#8208;bimetal coordination strategy was successfully applied to stabilize a ring&#8208;expanded porphyrin radical, [25]Hexaphyrin(1.0.1.0.1.0), i.&#8201;e., [25]Rosarin, in its neutral form by a mixed BF2/Rh(CO)2 coordination in the core.







Abstract
Stabilization of hexaphyrin(1.0.1.0.1.0) (named &#8220;rosarin&#8221;) in its 25&#960; radical state is achieved using a hetero&#8208;bimetal&#8208;coordination strategy. The antiaromatic BF2 complex B&#8208;1 was first synthesized, and then rhodium ion was inserted into B&#8208;1 to produce the BF2/Rh(CO)2 mixed complex Rh&#8208;B&#8208;1 as a highly air&#8208;stable radical. The structures of B&#8208;1 and Rh&#8208;B&#8208;1 were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffractions, and the antiaromatic or radical character was identified by various spectroscopy evidence and theoretical calculations. Rh&#8208;B&#8208;1 exhibits excellent redox properties, enabling amphoteric aromatic&#8208;antiaromatic conversion to their 24/26&#960; states. Compared to the 24/26&#960; conjugation systems on the same skeleton, Rh&#8208;B&#8208;1 has the narrowest electrochemical and optical band gaps, with the longest absorption band at 1010&#8197;nm. The ring&#8208;current analysis reveals intense paratropic currents for B&#8208;1 and co&#8208;existing diatropic&#8208;paratropic currents for Rh&#8208;B&#8208;1. This hetero&#8208;bimetal&#8208;coordination system provides a novel platform for organic radical stabilization on porphyrinoids, showing the prospect of modulating ligand oxidation states through rational coordination design.

         <title>Facilitating Electron Transfer by Resizing Cyclocarbon Acceptor from C18 to C16</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of low reorganization energy and high electron affinity makes the C16 cyclocarbon a better electron acceptor than the C18 molecule. In complexes with strong electron donors, photoinduced charge separation occurs within picoseconds.







Abstract
Recent advances in synthetic methods, combined with tip&#8208;induced on&#8208;surface chemistry, have enabled the formation of numerous cyclocarbon molecules. Here, we investigate computationally the experimentally studied C16 and C18 molecules as well as their van der Waals (vdW) complexes with several typical donor and acceptor molecules. Our results demonstrate a remarkable electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of cyclocarbon molecules. The vdW complexes of C16 and C18 exhibit a thermodynamically favorable photoinduced electron transfer (ET) from the donor partner to the cyclocarbons that occurs on a picosecond time scale. The lower reorganization energy of C16 compared to C18 leads to a significant acceleration of the ET reactions.

         <title>One&#8208;pot Synthesis of PdCuAg and CeO2 Nanowires Hybrid with Abundant Heterojunction Interface for Ethylene Glycol Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hybrid of PdCuAg and CeO2 nanowires with structural (abundant heterojunction/interfaces and ultrathin nanowire structure) and compositional advantages were facile prepared by one&#8208;pot method, thus embracing enhanced electrocatalytic performance for ethylene glycol oxidation reaction.







Abstract
Introducing CeO2 into Pd&#8208;based nanocatalysts for electrocatalytic reactions is a good way to solve the intermediate toxicity problem and improve the catalytic performance. Here we reported a simple strategy to synthesize the PdCuAg and CeO2 nanowires hybrid via a one&#8208;pot synthesis process under strong nanoconfined effect of specific surfactant as templates. Owing to the structural (ultrathin nanowires, abundant heterojunction/interfaces between metal and metal oxide) and compositional (Pd, Cu, Ag, CeO2) advantages, the hybrid showed significantly enhanced catalytic activity (6.06&#8197;A&#8201;mgPd&#8722;1) and stability, accelerated reaction rate, and reduced activation energy toward electrocatalytic ethylene glycol oxidation reaction.

         <title>Functional Plasticity of a Viral Terpene Synthase, OILTS, that Shows Non&#8211;Specific Metal Cofactor Binding and Metal&#8211;dependent Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
OILTS, a terpene synthase found from a giant virus, exhibits high plasticity to metal cofactors. It can use even Zn2+ known to severely decrease the activities of many terpene synthases. In addition, when Mn2+, Co2+, or Ni2+ were used as the cofactors, the profile of enzyme product was changed. The functional plasticity may benefit the virus in adapting to diverse environments, highlighting potential evolutionary implications.







Abstract
OILTS is a viral class I terpene synthase found from the giant virus Orpheovirus IHUMI&#8211;LCC2. It exhibits a unique structure and demonstrates high plasticity to metal cofactors, allowing it to biosynthesize different cyclic terpene frameworks. Notably, while OILTS produces only (+)&#8208;germacrene D&#8211;4&#8211;ol with the most common cofactor, Mg2+, it also biosynthesizes a different cyclic terpene, (+)&#8208;cubebol, with Mn2+, Co2+, or Ni2+, presenting a rare instance of cofactor&#8208;dependent enzyme catalysis. This is the first report of (+)&#8208;cubebol biosynthesis, to our knowledge. In addition, OILTS can uptake Zn2+ as a cofactor, which is uncommon among ordinary terpene synthases. These findings suggest that OILTS&#8242;s functional plasticity may benefit the virus in diverse host environments, highlighting potential evolutionary implications.

         <title>Mimicking Ozonolysis via Mechanochemistry: Internal Alkynes to 1,2&#8208;Diketones using H5IO6</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Utilizing periodic acid as an environmentally benign oxidizing agent, this study introduces a novel mechanochemical method that mimics ozonolysis to convert internal alkynes into 1,2&#8208;diketones, showcasing effective emulation of ozone's reactivity. Notably, this oxidation occurs at room temperature in aerobic conditions, eliminating the need for toxic transition metals, hazardous oxidants, or expensive solvents. Through control experiments validating the mechanism, substantial evidence supports a concerted reaction pathway. This progress marks a significant stride toward cleaner and more efficient chemical synthesis, mitigating the environmental impact of conventional processes. Assessing the green chemistry metrics in both solvent&#8208;free and previously reported solvent&#8208;based methods, our eco&#8208;friendly protocol demonstrates an E&#8208;factor of 7.40, a 51.7% atom economy, a 45.5% atom efficiency, 100% carbon efficiency, and 11.9% reaction mass efficiency when solvents are not used.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Utilizing periodic acid as an environmentally benign oxidizing agent, this study introduces a novel mechanochemical method that mimics ozonolysis to convert internal alkynes into 1,2-diketones, showcasing effective emulation of ozone's reactivity. Notably, this oxidation occurs at room temperature in aerobic conditions, eliminating the need for toxic transition metals, hazardous oxidants, or expensive solvents. Through control experiments validating the mechanism, substantial evidence supports a concerted reaction pathway. This progress marks a significant stride toward cleaner and more efficient chemical synthesis, mitigating the environmental impact of conventional processes. Assessing the green chemistry metrics in both solvent-free and previously reported solvent-based methods, our eco-friendly protocol demonstrates an E-factor of 7.40, a 51.7% atom economy, a 45.5% atom efficiency, 100% carbon efficiency, and 11.9% reaction mass efficiency when solvents are not used.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Amino Acid and Peptide Supramolecular Architectures through Fluorination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorinated non&#8208;natural amino acids are attracting considerable research interest, especially in the biomedical field and in materials science, thanks to their ability to self&#8208;assemble into peculiar supramolecular structures. The conformational changes induced by the presence of fluorine atoms obviously affect their functions, as well as the biological activity of the deriving peptides and proteins. Here, we will briefly describe the main effects of fluorination on the aggregation behavior of such building blocks, focusing in particular on their improved tendency to form fibrils, and gels therefrom. Our aim is to underline the promising potential of fluorination as a tool to affect the self&#8208;assembly features of amino acids, both when used alone and when inserted into polypeptide sequences. The ability of fluorine to influence physical, chemical, and structural properties of these substrates offers the possibility to engineer bioinspired materials with specific and tunable functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Types of Phyllobilins in a Fern &#8208; Molecular Reporters of the Evolution of Chlorophyll Breakdown in the Paleozoic Era</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Breakdown of chlorophyll (Chl), as studied in angiosperms, follows the pheophorbide a oxygenase/phyllobilin (PaO/PB) pathway, furnishing linear tetrapyrroles, named phyllobilins (PBs). In an investigation with fern leaves we have discovered iso&#8208;phyllobilanones (iPBs) with an intriguingly rearranged and oxidized carbon skeleton. We report here a key second group of iPBs from the fern and on their structure analysis. Previously, these additional Chl&#8208;catabolites escaped their characterization, since they exist in aqueous media as mixtures of equilibrating isomers. However, their chemical dehydration furnished stable iPB&#8208;derivatives that allowed the delineation of the enigmatic structures and chemistry of the original natural catabolites. The structures of all fern&#8208;iPBs reflect the early core steps of a PaO/PB&#8208;type pathway and the PB&#8208;to&#8208;iPB carbon skeleton rearrangement. A striking further degradative chemical ring&#8208;cleavage was observed, proposed to consume singlet molecular oxygen (1O2). Hence, Chl&#8208;catabolites may play a novel active role in detoxifying cellular 1O2. The critical deviations from the PaO/PB pathway, found in the fern, reflect evolutionary developments of Chl&#8208;breakdown in the green plants in the Paleozoic era.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Active Triazole&#8208;Derived Mesoionic Imines with Ferrocenyl Substituents and their Metal Complexes: Directed Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding, Unusual C&#8208;H Activation and Ion&#8208;Pair Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present herein the synthesis, characterization and complexation of ferrocenyl&#8208;substituted MIIs (mesoionic imines) and their metal complexes. In the free MIIs, strong hydrogen bonding interactions are observed between the imine&#8208;N and the C&#8208;H bonds of the ferrocenyl substituents both in the solid state and in solution. The influence of this hydrogen bonding is so strong that complexation of the MIIs with [IrCp*Cl2]2 yields unique six&#8208;membered iridacycles via C&#8208;H&#8208;activation of the corresponding C&#8208;H&#8208;site at the Fc&#8208;substituent and not the Ph&#8208;substituent. This result is in contrast to previous reports in which always a preferential C&#8208;H activation at the phenyl substituent is observed in competitive reactions in the presence of ferrocenyl substituents. The corresponding Ir complexes formed after in&#8208;situ halide exchange reaction exist in either [Ir&#8208;I] contact or as [Ir]+I&#8208; solvent separated ion&#8208;pairs depending on the solvent polarity. The iodide coordinated and solvent separated ion&#8208;pairs display drastically different physical properties. The TEP (Tolman&#8208;electronic&#8208;parameter) of these ligands was determined and lines up with previously reported MII&#8208;ligands. The redox properties were investigated by a combination of electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical methods. We show here how non&#8208;covalent interactions can have a drastic influence on the physical and chemical properties of these new class of compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>A Triply Linked&#160;Copper(III) Dicarbacorrole Dimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A triply linked dicarbacorrole dimer (7) was synthesized from a new meso&#8208;meso singly linked dicarbacorrole dimer precursor (6) via an oxidative fusion reaction by 2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;p&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ) in the presence of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TfOH). Single crystal X&#8208;ray structure of 7 adopts a flat conformation with a length as ca. 15.946 &#197; and a width as 6.903 &#197;, which can be regarded as a short carbaporphyrinoid tape. Two coordinated Cu ions keeps the +3 oxidation state in 7, as confirmed by NMR spectroscopy, single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). This is in sharp contrast to the Osuka&#8217;s triply linked tetrapyrrolic corrole dimers, where the inner 3NH form is not stable and thus can only act as a divalent ligand. Due to the non&#8208;aromatic nature of dicarbacorrole macrocycle, the largely decreased HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap and red&#8208;shifted absorption of 7 are best ascribed to the strong electronic interaction between two dipyrromethene&#8208;type chromophores. To our knowledge, this is the first fully fused carbaporphyrinoid dimer with &#946;&#8208;&#946;, meso&#8208;meso, &#946;&#8208;&#946; triply linkages prepared to date</dc:description>

         <title>Energy Barrier and Gaps between Two Excited States in a Dual&#8208;Emissive Carborane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A thorough understanding of the internal conversion process between excited states is important for designing ideal multiple emissive materials. However, it is hard to experimentally measure both the energy barrier and energy gaps between the excited states of a compound. For a long time, it is dubious if what was measured is the energy gap or energy barrier between two excited states. In this paper, we designed 1&#8208;(pyren&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;yl)&#8208;9,12&#8208;di(p&#8208;tolyl)&#8208;o&#8208;carborane (2), which shows dual emission in solution. Temperature&#8208;dependent fluorescence measurements show that the two emission bands in hexane are corresponding to two different excited states. The ratio of the emission bands is controlled by thermodynamics at higher temperatures and by kinetics at lower temperatures. Thus, the energy barrier and energy gaps between the two excited states of 2 can be experimentally estimated.</dc:description>

         <title>Current Developments in Emerging Lanthanide&#8208;doped persistent luminescent scintillators and their applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lanthanide&#8208;doped scintillators have the ability to convert the absorbed X&#8208;ray irradiation into ultraviolet (UV), visible (Vis), or near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light. Lanthanide&#8208;doped scintillators with excellent persistent luminescence are emerging as a new class of persistent luminescent materials recently. They have attracted great attention due to their unique "self&#8208;luminescence" characteristic and potential applications. In this review, we comb through and focus on current developments of lanthanide&#8208;doped persistent luminescent scintillators (PerLSs), including their persistent luminescence mechanism, synthetic methods, tuning of persistent luminescent properties (e.g. emission wavelength, intensity, and duration time), as well as their promising applications (e.g. information storage, encryption, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, bio&#8208;imaging, and photodynamic therapy). We hope this review will provide valuable guidance for the future development of PerLSs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Photoswitchable Metallocycle Based on Azobenzene: Synthesis, Characterization, and Ultrafast Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An azobenzene based Cu(I) metallocycle constituting the prototype for reversibly photoswitchable (3d&lt;M&#8208;)metallocycles (i.&#8201;e. without disassembly) is presented. Its ultrafast dynamics and the yield of the respective photostationary state reveal strong similarities with archetypical azobenzene. The unique combination of fs&#8208;TA and &#964;&#8208;PD elucidates the interplay of dynamics and solvation. Coupled with quantum chemical calculations, this interdisciplinary approach reveals a non&#8208;cooperative photoisomerization.







Abstract
The novel photoswitchable ligand 3,3&#8217;&#8208;Azobenz(metPA)2 (1) is used to prepare a [Cu2(1)2](BF4)2 metallocycle (2), whose photoisomerization was characterized using static and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic methods. Optical studies demonstrate the highly quantitative and reproducible photoinduced cyclic E/Z switching without decay of the complex. Accordingly and best to our knowledge, [Cu2(1)2](BF4)2 constitutes the first reversibly photoswitchable (3d)&#8208;metallocycle based on azobenzene. The photoinduced multiexponential dynamics in the sub&#8208;picosecond to few picosecond time domain of 1 and 2 have been assessed. These ultrafast dynamics as well as the yield of the respective photostationary state (PSSZ = 65&#8201;%) resemble the behavior of archetypical azobenzene. Also, the innovative pump&#8208;probe laser technique of gas phase transient photodissociation (&#964;&#8208;PD) in a mass spectrometric ion trap was used to determine the intrinsic relaxation dynamics for the isolated complex. These results are consistent with the results from femtosecond UV/Vis transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) in solution, emphasizing the azobenzene&#8208;like dynamics of 2. This unique combination of fs&#8208;TA and &#964;&#8208;PD enables valuable insights into the prevailing interplay of dynamics and solvation. Both analyses (in solution and gas phase) and quantum chemical calculations reveal a negligible effect of the metal coordination on the switching mechanism and electronic pathway, which suggests a non&#8208;cooperative isomerization process.

         <title>Structural Chemistry of Titanium (IV) Oxo Clusters, Part 2: Clusters Without Carboxylate or Phosphonate Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review completes a series of three articles which provide a comprehensive coverage of the structural chemistry of polynuclear titanium oxo compounds. The interplay of structure&#8208;influencing coordination characteristics of the ligands and preferred arrangement of the Ti/O polyhedra in the cluster cores is worked out.







Abstract
Homometallic titanium oxo clusters (TOC) are one of the most important groups of metal oxo clusters. In a previous article, TOC structures with carboxylato and phosphonato ligands were reviewed and categorized. This work is now extended to clusters with other ligands. Comparison of the different cluster types shows how the interplay between condensation of the titanium polyhedra by means of bridging oxygen atoms and the coordination characteristics of the ligands influences the cluster structures and allows working out basic construction principles of the cluster core.

         <title>Bimodal Glycosyl Donors as an Emerging Approach Towards a General Glycosylation Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stereoselective construction of the anomeric bond has constituted one of the greatest challenges in modern organic chemistry. In recent years, examples of &#8220;bimodal&#8221; glycosyl donors have emerged, demonstrating excellent stereocontrol for both &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;anomers. This mini review explores the reactivity and scope of these donors and highlights how they can streamline complex glycan construction.







Abstract
Organic synthesis provides an accessible route to preparative scale biological glycans, although schemes to access these complex structures are often complicated by preparation of multiple monosaccharide building blocks. Bimodal glycosyl donors capable of forming both &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;anomers selectively, are an emerging tactic to reduce the required number of individual synthetic components in glycan construction. This review discusses examples of bimodal donors in the literature, and how they achieve their stereocontrol for both anomers. Notable examples include a bespoke O&#8208;2 benzyl protecting group, a strained glycal for reaction using organometallic catalysis, and a simple perbenzylated donor optimised for stereoselective glycosylation through extensive reaction tuning.

         <title>Parametric Analysis of Donor Activation for Glycosylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a semi&#8208;automated assay to assign TA (activation temperature) and TD (decomposition temperature) to glycosyl donors, we established correlations to the assigned temperatures to both structural effects (protecting groups and monosaccharide core) and other experimental parameters (reagent concentrations).







Abstract
The chemical synthesis of complex oligosaccharides relies on efficient and highly reproducible glycosylation reactions. The outcome of a glycosylation is contingent upon several environmental factors, such as temperature, acidity, the presence of residual moisture, as well as the steric, electronic, and conformational aspects of the reactants. Each glycosylation proceeds rapidly and with a high yield within a rather narrow temperature range. For better control over glycosylations and to ensure fast and reliable reactions, a systematic analysis of 18 glycosyl donors revealed the effect of reagent concentration, water content, protecting groups, and structure of the glycosyl donors on the activation temperature. With these insights, we parametrize the first step of the glycosylation reaction to be executed reliably and efficiently.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the chemoselective perfluoroalkylation of triarylamines (TAA) is accomplished by visible light activation of a halogen&#8208;bonding complex between TAA and perfluoroalkyl iodides RF&#8722;I. The resulting perfluoroalkylated triarylamines, TAA&#8208;RF, undergo stereospecific unprecedented 6&#8208;&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization under photosensitized reaction in acetone to endo&#8208;carbazoles exclusively in quantitative yields.







Abstract
Blue LEDs&#8208;irradiation of a mixture of N,N,N',N'&#8208;tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) and perfluoroalkyl iodides (RF&#8722;I) &#8211; Electron Donor Acceptor (EDA)&#8208;complex &#8211; in the presence of triphenylamines (TPAs) in an aqueous solvent mixture afforded mono&#8208;perfluoroalkylated triphenylamines (RF&#8722;TPA) in good yields. These RF&#8722;TPA were further subjected to acetone&#8208;sensitized [6&#960;]&#8208;electrocyclization at 315&#8197;nm&#8208;irradiation affording exclusively perfluoroalkylated endo&#8208;carbazole derivatives (RF&#8722;CBz) in quantitative yields.

         <title>Push&#8208;Pull Bis&#8208;Norbornadienes for Solar Thermal Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Not only the production, but especially the storage of renewable energy is crucial for a sustainable society. A major challenge in the field of molecular solar thermal energy storage is designing visible light&#8208;absorbing photoswitches with long energy storage half&#8208;lives. Five novel visible light&#8208;absorbing norbornadiene dimers were prepared, with half&#8208;lives up to 23.0&#8197;hours, and high energy densities up to 379.3&#8197;kJ/kg.







Abstract
The norbornadiene/quadricyclane (NBD/QC) photoswitch pair represents a promising system for application in molecular solar thermal energy storage (MOST). Often, the NBD derivatives have very limited overlap with the solar spectrum, and substitution to redshift the absorption leads to a decrease in the gravimetric energy density. Dimeric systems mitigate this factor because two switches can &#8216;share&#8217; a substituent. Here, we present five new NBD dimers with red&#8208;shifted absorption spectra. One dimer features the most red&#8208;shifted absorption onset (539&#8197;nm) and a significantly red&#8208;shifted absorption maximum (404&#8197;nm) for NBD systems reported so far, without compromising thermal half&#8208;life. Promising properties for high&#8208;performance MOST applications are demonstrated, such as high absorption onsets reaching 539&#8197;nm, and energy densities of 379&#8197;kJ/kg, while still maintaining long half&#8208;lives of the metastable isomer, up to 23&#8197;hours at 25&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>High&#8208;pressure Synthesis of Cobalt Polynitrides: Unveiling Intriguing Crystal Structures and Nitridation Behavior</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nitridation behaviour of cobalt nitride unfolds along a progressive path under high&#8208;pressure conditions, as investigated using a laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cell, combined with synchrotron XRD, Raman spectroscopy, and density funtional theory. Our observations reveal a sequence of CoN6 octahedral framework transformations, including face&#8208;sharing (in CoN), edge&#8208;sharing (in CoN2 and CoN3), and isolated (in CoN5) polyhedra. These changes align with the polymerization of nitrogen within the crystal.







Abstract
In this study, we conduct extensive high&#8208;pressure experiments to investigate phase stability in the cobalt&#8208;nitrogen system. Through a combination of synthesis in a laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cell, first&#8208;principles calculations, Raman spectroscopy, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, we establish the stability fields of known high&#8208;pressure phases, hexagonal NiAs&#8208;type CoN, and marcasite&#8208;type CoN2 within the pressure range of 50&#8211;90&#8197;GPa. We synthesize and characterize previously unknown nitrides, Co3N2, Pnma&#8208;CoN and two polynitrides, CoN3 and CoN5, within the pressure range of 90&#8211;120&#8197;GPa. Both polynitrides exhibit novel types of polymeric nitrogen chains and networks. CoN3 feature branched&#8208;type nitrogen trimers (N3) and CoN5 show &#960;&#8208;bonded nitrogen chain. As the nitrogen content in the cobalt nitride increases, the CoN6 polyhedral frameworks transit from face&#8208;sharing (in CoN) to edge&#8208;sharing (in CoN2 and CoN3), and finally to isolated (in CoN5). Our study provides insights into the intricate interplay between structure evolution, bonding arrangements, and high&#8208;pressure synthesis in polynitrides, expanding the knowledge for the development of advanced energy materials

         <title>AuNP/MIL&#8208;88B&#8208;NH2 Nanocomposite for the Valorization of Nitroarene by Green Catalytic Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the in&#8197;situ formation of small gold nanoparticles inside the iron carboxylate metal organic framework MIL&#8208;88B&#8208;NH2. The resulting nanocomposite was tested in the hydrogenation of diverse nitroarenes, reaching high conversion rates in a sustainable reaction, as proven by green metrics.







Abstract
The efficiency of a catalytic process is assessed based on conversion, yield, and time effectiveness. However, these parameters are insufficient for evaluating environmentally sustainable research. As the world is urged to shift towards green catalysis, additional factors such as reaction media, raw material availability, sustainability, waste minimization and catalyst biosafety, need to be considered to accurately determine the efficacy and sustainability of the process. By combining the high porosity and versatility of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and the activity of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), efficient, cyclable and biosafe composite catalysts can be achieved. Thus, a composite based on AuNPs and the nanometric flexible porous iron(III) aminoterephthalate MIL&#8208;88B&#8208;NH2 was successfully synthesized and fully characterized. This nanocomposite was tested as catalyst in the reduction of nitroarenes, which were identified as anthropogenic water pollutants, reaching cyclable high conversion rates at short times for different nitroarenes. Both synthesis and catalytic reactions were performed using green conditions, and even further tested in a time&#8208;optimizing one&#8208;pot synthesis and catalysis experiment. The sustainability and environmental impact of the catalytic conditions were assessed by green metrics. Thus, this study provides an easily implementable synthesis, and efficient catalysis, while minimizing the environmental and health impact of the process.

         <title>Electrochemical Dehydration of Dicarboxylic Acids to Their Cyclic Anhydrides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical dehydrative reaction of dicarboxylic acids to their cyclic anhydrides is presented. The electrochemically generated anhydrides can be directly employed for amidation reactions. The mechanism of the reaction was investigated by 18O isotope labeling, revealing the formation of sulfate during electrolysis.







Abstract
An intramolecular electrochemical dehydration reaction of dicarboxylic acids to their cyclic anhydrides is presented. This electrolysis allows dicarboxylic acids as naturally abundant, inexpensive, safe, and readily available starting materials to be transformed into carboxylic anhydrides under mild reaction conditions. No conventional dehydration reagent is required. The obtained cyclic anhydrides are highly valuable reagents in organic synthesis, and in this report, we use them in&#8208;situ for acylation reactions of amines to synthesize amides. This work is part of the recent progress in electrochemical dehydration, which &#8211; in contrast to electrochemical dehydrogenative reactions for example &#8211; is an underexplored field of research. The reaction mechanism was investigated by 18O isotope labeling, revealing the formation of sulfate by electrochemical oxidation and hydrolysis of the thiocyanate&#8208;supporting electrolyte. This transformation is not a classical Kolbe electrolysis, because it is non&#8208;decarboxylative, and all carbon atoms of the carboxylic acid starting material are contained in the carboxylic anhydride. In total, 20 examples are shown with NMR yields up to 71&#8201;%.

         <title>Steric effects on single&#8208;molecule conductance in flat&#8208;lying phenanthrene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A previous combined experimental and theoretical study&#160;found that the position of anchoring groups on a phenanthrene&#160;(PHE) backbone played a large role in determining&#160;the single&#8208;molecule conductance of the PHE derivative.&#160;However, a consistent 0.1 G0 feature was found across all&#160;PHE derivatives. To understand this, the previously investigated&#160;PHE derivatives were placed flat on a simulated Au&#160;substrate with a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) tip&#160;over PHE and conductance was calculated using the non&#8208;equilibrium&#160;Green&#8217;s function technique in conjunction with&#160;density functional theory (NEGF&#8208;DFT). The location of the&#160;tip was varied to find the most conductive and most energetically&#160;favorable arrangements, which did not coincide.&#160;Furthermore, the variation in conductance found in erect&#160;junctions was not calculated to appear when PHE derivatives&#160;were lying flat, with all derivatives calculated to have&#160;conductance values around 0.1 G0.</dc:description>

         <title>Post&#8208;formation of fused pentagonal structure on fjord region of polyaromatic hydrocarbons under hydrothermal conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study explores the synthesis of cyclopenta&#8208;fused polyaromatic hydrocarbons (CP&#8208;PAHs) via Pt&#8208;catalyzed cyclization in water, focusing on the formation of fused pentagonal rings within heavily fused PAH frameworks. Utilizing platinum catalysts at lower temperatures (200&#8208;260&#176;C) in water, led to the successful synthesis of singly cyclized CP&#8208;PAHs. The reaction conditions facilitated the mono&#8208;cyclization of substrates such as dibenzo[g,p]chrysene and its isomers, yielding the desired products while suppressing the formation of bis&#8208;cyclized compounds. The use of Fe2O3 as an additive in conjunction with PtO2 was effective to suppress hydrogenation of the substrates and products. The products exhibited a redshift in UV&#8208;visible absorption and photoluminescence bands due to a decrease in the HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap. These findings highlight the potential of Pt&#8208;catalyzed cyclization for the controlled synthesis of CP&#8208;PAHs, with implications for various applications in materials science.</dc:description>

         <title>Directly&#8208;Fused Ni(II)Porphyrin Conjugated Polymers with Blocked meso&#8208;positions: Impact on Electrocatalytic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oxidative coupling reaction of two Ni(II) porphyrins meso&#8208;substituted with three and four phenyl groups, Ni(II) 5,10,15&#8208;(triphenyl)porphyrin (NiPh3P) and Ni(II) 5,10,15,20&#8208;(tetraphenyl)porphyrin (NiPh4P) respectively, was investigated in a oxidative chemical vapor deposition (oCVD) process. Irrespective of the number of meso&#8208;substituents, high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry evidences the formation of oligomeric species containing up to five porphyrin units. UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR and XPS analyses of the oCVD films highlighted a strong dependence of the intermolecular coupling reaction with the substrate temperature. Specifically, higher substrate temperatures yield lowering of valence band maxima and reduction of the band gap. The formation of conjugated polymeric assemblies results in increased conductivities as compared to their sublimed counterparts. Yet, electrocatalytic measurements exhibit water oxidation onset overpotentials (308 mV for pNiPh3P and 343 mV for pNiPh4P) comparatively higher than the onset overpotential measured for the oCVD film from Ni(II) 5,15&#8208;(diphenyl)porphyrin (pNiPh2P), i.e. 283 mV. Although DFT and comparative oCVD studies suggest the formation of directly fused porphyrins involving b&#8208;b &#160;linkages when reacting tetra&#8208;meso&#8208;substituted porphyrins, the present findings highlight that multiple direct fusion (b&#8208;b/meso&#8208;meso/b&#8208;b or meso&#8208;b/b&#8208;meso) is essential for Ni(II) porphyrin&#8208;based conjugated polymers to enable a dinuclear radical oxo&#8208;coupling operating mechanism for water oxidation at low overpotential and durable catalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Opportunity of Patterning in Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Patterning offers an efficient way to quantitatively enhance and enlarge material properties and functionalities, offering unprecedented opportunities for innovation in various scientific domains. By precisely controlling the spatial arrangement of materials at the micro&#8208; and nanoscale, patterning enables the exploitation of inherent material properties in novel ways. In addition, it generates new properties, leading to the development of advanced devices and applications. This article highlights the significant contributions of spatially controlled patterning in chemistry, particularly in generating new functional properties and devices, discussing some representative articles. Examples include the use of unconventional patterning techniques for surface functionalization, as well as the application of spatial confinement in improving material properties and controlling crystallization processes. Furthermore, the discussion extends to creating new devices, such as optical storage media and sensors, through spatial organization of materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Quaternary Isochromanes by Oxidative Aminocatalysis and Gold Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel strategy that combines oxidative aminocatalysis and gold catalysis allows the preparation of chiral &#945;&#8208;quaternary isochromanes, a motif that is prevalent in natural products and synthetic bioactive compounds. In the first step, &#945;&#8208;branched aldehydes and propargylic alcohols are transformed into &#945;&#8208;quaternary ethers with excellent optical purities (&gt;90% ee) via oxidative umpolung with DDQ and an amino acid&#8208;derived primary amine catalyst. Subsequent gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular hydroarylation affords the isochromane products with retention of the quaternary stereocenter. A second approach explores the use of allylic alcohols as reaction partners for the oxidative coupling to furnish &#945;&#8208;quaternary ethers with generally lower enantiopurities. Stereoretentive cyclization to isochromane products is achieved via intramolecular Friedel&#8208;Crafts type alkylation with allylic acetates as a reactive handle. A number of synthetic elaborations and a biological study on these &#945;&#8208;quaternary isochromanes highlight the potential applicability of the presented method.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The natural product (&#8208;)&#8208;TAN&#8208;2483B is a fungal secondary metabolite which displays promising anti&#8208;cancer and immunomodulatory activity. Our previous syntheses of (&#8208;)&#8208;TAN&#8208;2483B and sidechain analogues uncovered inhibitory activity against Bruton&#8217;s tyrosine kinase (Btk), an established drug target for various leukaemia and immunological diseases. A structure&#8208;based computational study using ensemble docking and molecular dynamics was performed to determine plausible binding modes for (&#8208;)&#8208;TAN&#8208;2483B and analogues in the Btk binding site. These hypotheses guided the design of new analogues which were synthesised and their inhibitory activities determined, providing insights into the structural determinants of the furopyranone scaffold that confer both activity and selectivity for Btk. These findings offer new perspectives for generating optimised (&#8208;)&#8208;TAN&#8208;2483B&#8208;based kinase inhibitors for the treatment of leukaemia and immunological diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Ion Mobility Mass Spectrometry&#8208;based Disaccharide Analysis of Glycosaminoglycans</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are linear and acidic polysaccharides. They are ubiquitous molecules, which are involved in a wide range of biological processes. Despite being structurally simple at first glance, with a repeating backbone of alternating hexuronic acid and hexosamine dimers, GAGs display a highly complex structure, which predominantly results from their heterogeneous sulfation patterns. The commonly applied method for compositional analysis of all GAGs is "disaccharide analysis." In this process, GAGs are enzymatically depolymerized into disaccharides, derivatized with a fluorescent label, and then analysed through liquid chromatography. The limiting factor in the high throughput analysis of GAG disaccharides is the time&#8208;consuming liquid chromatography. To address this limitation, we here utilized trapped ion mobility&#8208;mass spectrometry (TIM&#8208;MS) for the separation of isomeric GAG disaccharides, which reduces the measurement time from hours to a few minutes. A full set of disaccharides comprises twelve structures, with eight possessing isomers. Most disaccharides cannot be differentiated by TIM&#8208;MS in underivatized form. Therefore, we developed chemical modifications to reduce sample complexity and enhance differentiability. Quantification is performed using stable isotope labelled standards, which are easily available due to the nature of the performed modifications.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are linear and acidic polysaccharides. They are ubiquitous molecules, which are involved in a wide range of biological processes. Despite being structurally simple at first glance, with a repeating backbone of alternating hexuronic acid and hexosamine dimers, GAGs display a highly complex structure, which predominantly results from their heterogeneous sulfation patterns. The commonly applied method for compositional analysis of all GAGs is "disaccharide analysis." In this process, GAGs are enzymatically depolymerized into disaccharides, derivatized with a fluorescent label, and then analysed through liquid chromatography. The limiting factor in the high throughput analysis of GAG disaccharides is the time-consuming liquid chromatography. To address this limitation, we here utilized trapped ion mobility-mass spectrometry (TIM-MS) for the separation of isomeric GAG disaccharides, which reduces the measurement time from hours to a few minutes. A full set of disaccharides comprises twelve structures, with eight possessing isomers. Most disaccharides cannot be differentiated by TIM-MS in underivatized form. Therefore, we developed chemical modifications to reduce sample complexity and enhance differentiability.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, protonation constant values and liquid chromatographic behaviors of hydrophobic cyclizine, chlorcyclizine, hydroxyzine, cinnarizine, cetirizine, meclizine, and buclizine in some water&#8208;organic solvent binary mixtures were examined for the first time using classical and green reverse phase liquid chromatography methods. In the isocratic study, the relationship of the retention time and mobile phase pH in water&#8208;organic solvent binary mixtures containing acetonitrile (45, 50, 55, 60, 65, v/v), methanol (60, 65, 70, 75, v/v) and ethanol (45, 50, 55, 56, 59, 60, 62, 65, v/v) were determined at 37 &#176;C.&#160; In the study, XBridge C18 and Gemini NX C18 columns suitable for the chemical properties of basic compounds were used. The obtained liquid chromatographic data were analyzed using the linear solvation energy relationship methodology and the SOLVER program. The aqueous protonation constant values of the investigated compounds were calculated using the linear relationship between the protonation constant data calculated in studied binary mixtures and some macroscopic constant values of the solvents used. The greenness of methods developed using three different solvents was evaluated with the Analytical Greenness Metric Approach, the Green Analytical Procedures Index, and the Green Solvent Selection Tool approaches.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyrene Functionalized Norbornadiene&#8208;Quadricyclane Fluorescent Photoswitches: Characterization of their Spectral Properties and Application in Imaging of Amyloid Beta Plaques</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study presents the synthesis and characterization of two fluorescent norbornadiene (NBD) photoswitches, each incorporating two conjugated pyrene units. Expanding on the limited repertoire of reported photoswitchable fluorescent NBDs, we explore their properties with a focus on applications in bioimaging of amyloid beta (A&#946;) plaques. While the fluorescence emission of the NBD decreases upon photoisomerization, aligning with what has been previously reported, for the first time we observed luminescence after irradiation of the quadricyclane (QC) isomer. We deduce how the observed emission is induced by photoisomerization to the excited state of the parent isomer (NBD) which is then the emitting species. Thorough characterizations including NMR, UV&#8208;Vis, fluorescence, X&#8208;ray structural analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide a comprehensive understanding of these systems. Notably, one NBD&#8208;QC system exhibits exceptional durability. Additionally, these molecules serve as effective fluorescent stains targeting A&#946; plaques in situ, with observed NBD/QC switching within the plaques. Molecular docking simulations explore NBD interactions with amyloid, unveiling novel binding modes. These insights mark a crucial advancement in the comprehension and design of future photochromic NBDs for bioimaging applications and beyond, emphasizing their potential in studying and addressing protein aggregates</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorescence and Lifetime Imaging of Endoplasmic Reticulum Polarity Change During Ferroptosis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a new form of regulated cell death, ferroptosis is closely related to various diseases. Tracing ferroptosis related biological behavior is helpful to better understand this process and its related biology. Considering that ferroptosis is featured with remarkable lipid peroxidation which can easily change the membranes&#8217; compositions and structures, it is potential to detect intracellular environmental changes for direct assessment of ferroptosis. In view of the close relationship between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and ferroptosis, we designed an ER&#8208;targeted and polarity&#8208;sensitive fluorescent probe SBD&#8208;CH, which has superior photostability and can respond to polarity with high selectivity without the affection of viscosity. SBD&#8208;CH can monitor the trend of ER polarity during ferroptosis by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), and analyze the distribution of polarity in ferroptosis by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). During Erastin induced ferroptosis, the polarity of ER in HT&#8208;1080 cells increased and the polarity distribution in ER was more dispersed. Our work provides an effective strategy for evaluating the process of ferroptosis by monitoring the changes of ER polarity.</dc:description>

         <title>Fagopyrins from Buckwheat Flowers: Structural and Stereochemical Characterization through Combined NMR/CD Spectroscopy and Theoretical Calculations.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fagopyrins are phenantroperylenequinones present in the flowers of Fagopyrum esculentum (buckwheat) endowed with photodynamic activity. It has been reported that fagopyrin extracts actually contain a complex mixture of closely related compounds, differing only on the nature of the perylenequinone substituents. We report our systematic and detailed study on the chemical composition of fagopyrin extracts by a combination of preparative and analytical techniques. The combined use of 1H&#8208;NMR and CD spectroscopy was found to be particularly suited to fully characterize all stereochemical aspects of the extracted fagopyrins. For the first time nine isomers have been structurally characterized and their stereochemistry fully elucidated. The presence of two different heterocyclic ring substituents, two stereogenic centers and the inherent axial chirality of the aromatic system provides a complex stereochemical relationships among isomers, thus giving account of the high level of molecular multiplicity found in the extract.</dc:description>

         <title>Amorphous Anode Materials for Fast&#8208;charging Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 22, April 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous materials have emerged as effective solutions to enhance the fast charging performance of anodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The concept summarizes the recent strides made in this emerging field and outlines the various strategies employed for designing anodes to incorporate amorphous materials. The challenges and future prospects have also been discussed.







Abstract
Fast&#8208;charging technology is set to revolutionize the field of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), driving the creation of next&#8208;generation devices with the ability to get charged within a short span of time. From the anode perspective, it is of paramount importance to design materials that can withstand continuous Li+ insertion/deinsertion at high charging rates and still remain unaffected by factors such as mechanical fractures, electrolyte side reactions, polarisation, lithium plating and heat generation. Herein, the recent advancements in the design of amorphous materials as anodes for fast&#8208;charging LIBs have been discussed. While the development of this particular class of materials for application in high&#8208;rate anodes has been paid limited attention in recent literature, it holds immense promise for improving the fast&#8208;charging capabilities. This concept summarizes the recent strides made in this emerging field, outlining the strategies employed in the design of amorphous anodes and emphasizing the crucial role played by the amorphous nature in achieving fast&#8208;charging performance. Further, the successive initiatives that can be undertaken to drive the progress of amorphous materials for fast charging LIBs have also been detailed, which could potentially improve their commercial viability.

The concept of combining molecular hourglass with anion&#8211;&#960; interactions for mimicking the shape and function of the ClC chloride channel selective pore is presented. High and regulatable chloride transport conductance and selectivity that replicate the properties demonstrated by ClC is achieved through modifying the constituent components of the molecular hourglass.







Abstract
ClC is the main family of natural chloride channel proteins that transport Cl&#8722; across the cell membrane with high selectivity. The chloride transport and selectivity are determined by the hourglass&#8208;shaped pore and the filter located in the central and narrow region of the pore. Artificial unimolecular channel that mimics both the shape and function of the ClC selective pore is attractive, because it could provide simple molecular model to probe the intriguing mechanism and structure&#8208;function relevance of ClC. Here we elaborated upon the concept of molecular hourglass plus anion&#8211;&#960; interactions for this purpose. The concept was validated by experimental results of molecular hourglasses using shape&#8208;persistent 1,3&#8208;alternate tetraoxacalix[2]arene[2]triazine as the central macrocyclic skeleton to control the conductance and selectivity, and anion&#8211;&#960; interactions as the driving force to facilitate the chloride dehydration and movement along the channel.

         <title>The Resorcinarene Hexameric Capsule as a Supramolecular Photoacid to Trigger Olefin Hydroarylation in Confined Space</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 22, April 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under light irradiation the hexameric resorcinarene capsule increases in acidity of 8.8&#8197;log units with respect to its ground state, becoming the first example of a self&#8208;assembled supramolecular photoacid. The photoacidity of the hexameric capsule was here exploited to boost the olefin hydroarylation reactions in confined space while no reaction occurred in the absence of irradiation and/or capsule. DFT calculations strongly corroborated a mechanism in which the photoacidity of C6* plays a crucial role.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembled resorcinarene capsule C6 shows remarkable photoacidity upon light irradiation, which is here exploited to catalyze olefin hydroarylation reactions in confined space. An experimental pKa* value range of &#8722;3.3&#8211;&#8722;2.8 was estimated for the photo&#8208;excited hexameric capsule C6*, and consequently an increase in acidity of 8.8&#8197;log units was observed with respect to its ground state (pKa=5.5&#8211;6.0). This makes the hexameric capsule the first example of a self&#8208;assembled supramolecular photoacid. The photoacid C6* can catalyze hydroarylation reaction of olefins with aromatic substrates inside its cavity, while no reaction occurred between them in the absence of irradiation and/or capsule. DFT calculations corroborated a mechanism in which the photoacidity of C6* plays a crucial role in the protonation step of the aromatic substrate. A further proton transfer to olefin with a concomitant C&#8722;C bond formation and a final deprotonation step lead to product releasing.

         <title>3&#8208;Oxidopyridinium Ions Are Versatile Bioorthogonal Dipoles for Use in Cycloadditions with Cyclooctynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 22, April 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
[3+2] cycloadditions between 3&#8208;oxidopyridiniums and the common bioorthogonal reagent dibenzocyclooctyne (DIBO) are kinetically tuned by substitution at the 5 position, where a linear Hammett relationship is seen to favour electron donating groups. Second&#8208;order rate constants on the order of 1&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 have been achieved in acetonitrile at room temperature.







Abstract
3&#8208;oxidopyridinium ions are water stable and soluble heteroaromatic betaines that behave as latent dipoles and undergo a wide variety of cycloadditions. Research into the cycloaddition reactions of 3&#8208;oxidopyridiniums was spearheaded by Alan R. Katritzky and collaborators from the early 1970s until the late 1980s, but they have yet to be used for bioorthogonal applications. Herein we report that 3&#8208;oxidopyridiniums can readily react with 4&#8208;dibenzocyclooctynol (DIBO), a common bioorthogonal handle, in a [3+2] cycloaddition. The mechanism was investigated by altering the electronics of the reaction by changing the substituent on the 5 position of the pyridinium. Electron&#8208;donating 5&#8208;substituents have been shown to significantly increase the rate of the reaction, with bimolecular rate constants ranging from 3.3&#215;10&#8722;4&#8201;s&#8722;1 with 5&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;N&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;oxidopyridinium to 1.07&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 with 5&#8208;amino&#8208;N&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;oxidopyridinium. 3&#8208;oxidopyridiniums&#8217; appreciable cycloaddition rates and compatibility with bioorthogonally relevant environments give them the potential to be used in a variety of bioconjugation applications.

         <title>Dextrans, Pullulan and Lentinan, New Scaffold Materials for Use as Hydrogels in Tissue Engineering</title>

A hydrogel saccharide world: The synthesis of hydrogels based on dextrans, pullulan, and lentinan under physiological conditions are reported by evaluating two different &#8220;click&#8221;&#8208;strategies. In selected cases either ligands (L) with growth factor properties or alternatively fluorescent dyes are attached to the hydrogels for biomedical applications. In addition, rheological properties, water uptake, permeability, degradability and cytotoxicity have been assessed.







Abstract
The development of hydrogels based on dextrans, pullulan and lentinan to be used in biomedical applications including tissue engineering is reported. Despite the fact that selected polysaccharides such as hyaluronic acid are well established, little is known, how these polysaccharides can be chemically modified to create hydrogels under controlled conditions. In this study we present a small library of chemically modified polysaccharides which are used for a divergent approach to achieve biomedical relevant hydrogels. In this case the crosslinking is based on thio ether formation between thiol modified donor and vinylsulfone or maleimide modified acceptor components. Successful synthesis of the linker systems and coupling at the polysaccharides, hydrogel formation takes place under physiological conditions. We extended the study by coupling small molecules like adhesion factors for increasing cell compatibility as well as a dye for further studies. The different hydrogels were studied to their rheological properties, water uptake, their permeability, biodegrability and their cytotoxicity.

         <title>NiCo&#8208;LDH coupled with 2D ZIF&#8208;derived Co nitrogen doped carbon nanosheet arrays as a self&#8208;supporting electrocatalyst for detection of formaldehyde</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 22, April 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique coupling NiCo&#8208;LDH with 2D ZIF derived Co&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;doped porous carbon on carbon cloth (Co&#8722;N/C@NiCo&#8208;LDH NSAs/CC) acts as a self&#8208;supporting electrode has excellent sensing performance for formaldehyde with low detection limit of 82&#8197;nM at S/N=3 and a wide linear range of 1&#8197;&#956;M to 13&#8197;mM, respectively.







Abstract
Formaldehyde is susceptible to illegal addition to foodstuffs to extend their shelf life due to its antimicrobial, preservative and bleaching properties. In this study, a self&#8208;supporting &#8220;nanosheet on nanosheet&#8221; arrays electrocatalyst with core&#8208;shell heterostructure was prepared in&#8197;situ by coupling NiCo layer double hydroxide with 2D ZIF derived Co&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;doped porous carbon on carbon cloth (Co&#8722;N/C@NiCo&#8208;LDH NSAs/CC). Co&#8722;N/C nanosheet arrays act as a scaffold core with good electrical conductivity, providing more NiCo&#8208;LDH nucleation sites to avoid NiCo&#8208;LDH agglomeration, thus having fast mass/charge transfer performance. While the NiCo&#8208;LDH nanosheet arrays shell with high specific surface area provide more active sites for electrochemical reactions. As an electrocatalytic sensing electrode, Co&#8722;N/C@NiCo&#8208;LDH NSAs/CC has a wide linear range of 1&#8197;&#956;M to 13&#8197;mM for formaldehyde detection, and the detection limit is 82&#8197;nM. Besides, the sensor has been applied to the detection of formaldehyde in food samples with satisfactory results.

&lt;p&gt;A unique coupling NiCo-LDH with 2D ZIF derived Co-nitrogen-doped porous carbon on carbon cloth (Co&#8722;N/C@NiCo-LDH NSAs/CC) acts as a self-supporting electrode has excellent sensing performance for formaldehyde with low detection limit of 82&#8197;nM at S/N=3 and a wide linear range of 1&#8197;&#956;M to 13&#8197;mM, respectively.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formaldehyde is susceptible to illegal addition to foodstuffs to extend their shelf life due to its antimicrobial, preservative and bleaching properties. In this study, a self-supporting &#8220;nanosheet on nanosheet&#8221; arrays electrocatalyst with core-shell heterostructure was prepared in&#8197;situ by coupling NiCo layer double hydroxide with 2D ZIF derived Co-nitrogen-doped porous carbon on carbon cloth (Co&#8722;N/C@NiCo-LDH NSAs/CC). Co&#8722;N/C nanosheet arrays act as a scaffold core with good electrical conductivity, providing more NiCo-LDH nucleation sites to avoid NiCo-LDH agglomeration, thus having fast mass/charge transfer performance. While the NiCo-LDH nanosheet arrays shell with high specific surface area provide more active sites for electrochemical reactions. As an electrocatalytic sensing electrode, Co&#8722;N/C@NiCo-LDH NSAs/CC has a wide linear range of 1&#8197;&#956;M to 13&#8197;mM for formaldehyde detection, and the detection limit is 82&#8197;nM. Besides, the sensor has been applied to the detection of formaldehyde in food samples with satisfactory results.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Sensitive Switchable Sensors for Hydroxide on Glass Surfaces Based on Isoquinolinium&#8208;Quinolinium&#8208;substituted Acetylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 22, April 16, 2024. </description>

The title compounds are sensitive sensors for less than 0.5&#8197;ppm hydroxide, the release of which can even be detected from high&#8208;quality wine glasses by intensive coloration. Adduct formation with O&#8208;nucleophiles is responsible for this. Acid reconstitutes the initial state.







Abstract
Bi&#8208;substituted acetylenes with a quinolinium and an isoquinolinium substituent are described, which reversibly form intensely colored adducts with O&#8208;nucleophiles and thus enable the detection of &gt;0,5&#8197;ppm hydroxide on the surfaces of various glasses. Acids reconstitute the colorless bi&#8208;substituted acetylenes. The quinolinium and isoquinolinium rings are bound via their 2&#8208;, 3&#8208;, 4&#8208; and 1&#8208;, 3&#8208;, 4&#8208;positions to the triple bond, respectively. The choice of substitution sites of the hetarenium rings enables the design of mixed conjugated/cross&#8208;conjugated &#960;&#8208;electron systems. Depending on the combination of binding sites, the frontier orbital profile, the triple bond polarization, the fluorescence behaviour, and the sensitivity to hydroxide differs.

         <title>In&#8208;situ confining selenium within bubble &#8211; like carbon nanoshells for ultra&#8208;stable Li&#8722;Se batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 22, April 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a novel &#8220;top&#8211;down&#8221; approach to in&#8211;situ confine Se within bubble&#8211;like carbon frameworks to minimize the shuttle effect and volume expansion of Se cathode in Li&#8208;Se batteries. The resultant Se@void@BLNC shows a unique half&#8208;filled core&#8208;shell structure than ensures an ultra&#8208;stable cycling performance of almost 100% capacity reservation during 4000 cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;selenium (Li&#8722;Se) batteries are promising energy storage devices. However, the long&#8208;term durability and high&#8208;rate performance of the Se cathode have been limited by significant volume expansion and the troublesome shuttle effect of polyselenides during repeated charging/discharging processes. To revolutionize these issues, we applied a top&#8208;down strategy through the in&#8208;situ trapping of amorphous Se within bubble&#8208;like carbon (BLC) frameworks, which can radically minimize the presence of surface&#8208;absorbed Se while enhancing Se loading capacity. This ingenious technique successfully encapsulates all Se species within carbon nanoshells, creating a distinct half&#8208;filled core&#8208;shell structure known as Se@void@BLC. This in&#8208;situ trapping approach ensures the efficient management of Se volume changes during repeated discharge and charge cycles. Moreover, an extraordinary Se loading capacity of up to 65.6&#8197;wt% is reached. Using the Se@void@BLC as cathode for Li&#8722;Se battery, we achieve a high initial Columbic efficiency of 84.2&#8201;%, a high reversible capacity of 585&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, and an ultralow capacity decay of only 0.0037&#8201;% per cycle during 4000 cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <dc:description>
Two units of highly stable luminescent triarylmethyl radical (PyBTM) were bridged by p&#8208;phenylene linker. The photoluminescence quantum yield (&#934;f) of the diradical (1) was decreased than the PyBTM monoradical. Adding two mesityl groups on the terminals of PyBTM&#8722;PhPyBTM diradical (2) did not improve the &#934;f, but adding two n&#8208;hexyl groups on the bridging p&#8208;phenylene (3) did greatly improve it.







Abstract
Two units of highly stable luminescent triarylmethyl radical, (3,5&#8208;dichloro&#8208;4&#8208;pyridyl)bis(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl radical (PyBTM), were bridged by p&#8208;phenylene linker. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of PyBTM&#8722;PhPyBTM was at most 0.4&#8201;% in various organic solvents. Adding two mesityl groups on the terminals did not improve the PLQY. In the MesPyBTM&#8722;PhPyBTM&#8722;Mes, the mesityl group did not worked as an electron donor unlike the previously reported monoradical MesPyBTM. However, adding two n&#8208;hexyl groups on the bridging p&#8208;phenylene did greatly improve it, and the PLQY of the PyBTM&#8722;(Hex2Ph)PyBTM was 7&#8201;% in dichloromethane and acetone, and 12&#8201;% in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) film. Twisting p&#8208;phenylene linker by hexyl groups hindered the &#960;&#8208;conjugation and suppressed the non&#8208;radiative decay of the excited state.

         <title>Bi(III) Binding Stoichiometry and Domain&#8208;Specificity Differences Between Apo and Zn(II)&#8208;bound Human Metallothionein 1a</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 22, April 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metallothionein (MT) binds a variety of metals using 20 cysteine residues. When Bi(III) binds to apo&#8208;MT, a maximum of six Bi(III) bind. The binding of Bi(III) &#8220;tangles&#8221; the protein, resulting in free but inaccessible cysteines, preventing further binding. When Bi(III) binds to Zn7MT, the formation of Bi7MT is favourable, showing that the initial MT structure impacts the metallated species formed.







Abstract
Bismuth is a xenobiotic metal with a high affinity to sulfur that is used in a variety of therapeutic applications. Bi(III) induces the cysteine&#8208;rich metallothionein (MT), a protein known to form two&#8208;domain cluster structures with certain metals such as Zn(II), Cd(II), or Cu(I). The binding of Bi(III) to MTs has been previously studied, but there are conflicting reports on the stoichiometry and binding pathway, which appear to be highly dependent on pH and initial metal&#8208;loading status of the MT. Additionally, domain specificity has not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, ESI&#8208;MS was used to determine the binding constants of [Bi(EDTA)]&#8722; binding to apo&#8208;MT1a and its individual &#945;MT fragment. The results were compared to previous experiments using &#946;MT1a and &#946;&#945;MT3. Domain specificity was investigated using proteolysis methods and the initial cooperatively formed Bi2MT was found to bind to cysteines that spanned across the traditional metal binding domain regions. Titrations of [Bi(EDTA)]&#8722; into Zn7MT were performed and were found to result in a maximum stoichiometry of Bi7MT, contrasting the Bi6MT formed when [Bi(EDTA)]&#8722; was added to apo&#8208;MT. These results show that the initial structure of the apo&#8208;MT determines the stoichiometry of new incoming metals and explains the previously observed differences in stoichiometry.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bismuth is a xenobiotic metal with a high affinity to sulfur that is used in a variety of therapeutic applications. Bi(III) induces the cysteine-rich metallothionein (MT), a protein known to form two-domain cluster structures with certain metals such as Zn(II), Cd(II), or Cu(I). The binding of Bi(III) to MTs has been previously studied, but there are conflicting reports on the stoichiometry and binding pathway, which appear to be highly dependent on pH and initial metal-loading status of the MT. Additionally, domain specificity has not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, ESI-MS was used to determine the binding constants of [Bi(EDTA)]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; binding to apo-MT1a and its individual &#945;MT fragment. The results were compared to previous experiments using &#946;MT1a and &#946;&#945;MT3. Domain specificity was investigated using proteolysis methods and the initial cooperatively formed Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MT was found to bind to cysteines that spanned across the traditional metal binding domain regions. Titrations of [Bi(EDTA)]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; into Zn&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;MT were performed and were found to result in a maximum stoichiometry of Bi&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;MT, contrasting the Bi&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;MT formed when [Bi(EDTA)]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; was added to apo-MT. These results show that the initial structure of the apo-MT determines the stoichiometry of new incoming metals and explains the previously observed differences in stoichiometry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Formed Electron Inhibitor Enabling Dendrite&#8208;free Garnet Electrolytes: A Case Study of Fumed Silica</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 22, April 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The modified solid&#8208;state electrolytes were prepared by introducing fumed silica (FS) into Ta&#8208;doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZTO). The introduced FS could decrease the ion migration activation energy, decrease the electronic conductivity, acting as electron inhibitor in the garnet pellet, thus improving the overall battery performance. Our research contributes to the advancement of dendrite&#8208;free solid&#8208;state electrolytes and high&#8208;performance all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.







Abstract
Ta&#8208;doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZTO) solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SEs) show great promise for solid&#8208;state batteries due to its high conductivity and safety. However, one of the challenges it faces is lithium dendrite propagation upon long&#8208;term cycling. To address this issue, we propose the incorporation of fumed silica (FS) at the grain boundaries of LLZTO to modify the properties of the garnet pellet, which effectively inhibits the dendrite growth. The introduction of FS has demonstrated several beneficial effects. Firstly, it reduces the migration barrier of lithium ions, which helps prevent dendrite formation and propagation. Additionally, FS reduces the electronic conductivity of the SEs pellet, suppressing the dendrite formation. Moreover, the formed lithium silicates from FS might also be acted as electron inhibitor, thus inhibiting the lithium dendrite growth upon cycling. By investigating the use of FS as a modifier in LLZTO&#8208;based electrolytes, our study contributes to advancing dendrite&#8208;free solid&#8208;state electrolytes and thus the development of high&#8208;performance all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Phosphorescent Platinum(II) Complexes with a Spiro&#8208;fused Xanthene Unit: Synthesis and Photophysical Properties</title>

The synthesis of phosphorescent platinum(II) complexes chelated by an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) linked to a cyclometalating spiro[fluorene&#8208;9,9&#8217;&#8208;xanthene] (SFX) motif in 2&#8208;position, is hereby reported. Acetylacetonate (acac), bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)propane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dionate (mesacac) and dihydrobis(3,5&#8208;dimethylpyrazole&#8208;1&#8208;yl) borate are used as auxiliary ligands. These complexes show ligand&#8208;centered (LC) green&#8208;blue emission with photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) ranging from 87&#8201;%&#8211;91&#8201;%. The emission lifetimes vary from 33&#8197;&#956;s to 43&#8197;&#956;s. DFT calculations show that the corresponding 2&#8217;&#8208;regioisomer of the SFX motif with the mesacac ligand has a strong metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT) character instead of a LC character.







Abstract
Novel platinum(II) complexes, derived from the spiro[fluorene&#8208;9,9&#8217;&#8208;xanthene] (SFX) motif, were synthesized and combined with different auxiliary ligands such as acetylacetonate (acac), bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)propane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dionate (mesacac) and dihydrobis(3,5&#8208;dimethylpyrazole&#8208;1&#8208;yl) borate. The final products were obtained in yields of up to 36&#8201;% and characterized by NMR, X&#8208;ray and combustion analysis. These complexes have structured green&#8208;blue emission spectra with Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIExy) coordinates of (0.21;0.46). Excellent photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) ranging from 87&#8201;%&#8211;91&#8201;% were found. The emission lifetimes vary from 33&#8197;&#956;s to 43&#8197;&#956;s. Calculations on the B3LYP/6&#8208;311++G** level of theory reveal, that the nature of the emissive state is dependent on the positional regioisomerism of the SFX motif. The 2&#8208;SFX complexes demonstrate ligand&#8208;centered (3LC) emission, while the 2&#8217;&#8208;SFX regioisomer with the mesacac ligand shows a strong 3MLCT character.

This work provides the effective construction of CMP 3D composite films (pZn/PTPCz) with a controlled porosity structure and preferred orientation using the template&#8208;assisted electropolymerization (EP) approach for the first time. When compared to the control CMP film made on flat substrates, the as&#8208;prepared pZn/PTPCz composite films showed significantly enhanced fluorescent intensity and much better sensing performance for the model explosive.







Abstract
High&#8208;quality conjugated microporous polymer (CMP) films with orientation and controlled structure are extremely desired for applications. Here, we report the effective construction of CMP 3D composite films (pZn/PTPCz) with a controlled porosity structure and preferred orientation using the template&#8208;assisted electropolymerization (EP) approach for the first time. The structure of pZn/PTPCz composite thin films and nitrophenol sensing performance were thoroughly studied. When compared to the control CMP film made on flat indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates, the as&#8208;prepared pZn/PTPCz composite films showed significantly enhanced fluorescent intensity and much better sensing performance for the model explosive. This was attributed to the metal&#8208;enhanced fluorescence (MEF) of porous nanostructured zinc (pZn) and the additional macroporosity of the pZn/PTPCz composite films. This work provides a feasible approach for creating oriented 3D CMP&#8208;based thin films for advanced applications.

         <title>TiO2/Loofah&#8211;Halloysite Bio&#8211;Hybrid Composites as Efficient Systems for VOCs Removal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 22, April 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes an easy and environmentally friendly synthesis of TiO2/loofah&#8211;halloysite composite from low&#8211;cost and environmentally friendly materials such as loofah fibers and halloysite nanotubes. The material has been extensively characterized. The co&#8211;presence of loofah, halloysite nanotubes, and titanium dioxide allowed a synergistic effect for application in the photooxidation of VOCs, such as toluene and ethanol.







Abstract
Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), recognized as hazardous air contaminants, prompt the exploration of sustainable air purification methods. Solar photocatalytic oxidation emerges as a promising solution, utilizing semiconductor photocatalysts like titanium dioxide (TiO2). However, the raw material crisis necessitates reduced TiO2 usage, leading to investigations into TiO2 modification techniques. The study introduces a novel approach by employing natural fibers, specifically loofah sponge, as a TiO2 support. This method aims to maintain photocatalytic activity while minimizing TiO2 content. The article explores using halloysite, a natural clay mineral, as a supportive material, enhancing mechanical strength and adsorption properties. The resulting TiO2/loofah&#8211;halloysite composites are evaluated for their efficacy in gas&#8208;phase photocatalytic oxidation of toluene and ethanol, chosen as representative VOCs. The conversion of toluene and ethanol on the composite was 88&#8201;% and 39&#8201;%, respectively, with high selectivity toward CO2. In addition to its high performance, the bio&#8211;composite was stable for several conversion cycles, keeping the conversion activity unchanged. The study contributes to developing green hybrid materials for VOC removal, showcasing potential applications across industries.

However, the raw material crisis necessitates reduced TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; usage, leading to investigations into TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; modification techniques. The study introduces a novel approach by employing natural fibers, specifically loofah sponge, as a TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; support. This method aims to maintain photocatalytic activity while minimizing TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; content. The article explores using halloysite, a natural clay mineral, as a supportive material, enhancing mechanical strength and adsorption properties. The resulting TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/loofah&#8211;halloysite composites are evaluated for their efficacy in gas-phase photocatalytic oxidation of toluene and ethanol, chosen as representative VOCs. The conversion of toluene and ethanol on the composite was 88&#8201;% and 39&#8201;%, respectively, with high selectivity toward CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In addition to its high performance, the bio&#8211;composite was stable for several conversion cycles, keeping the conversion activity unchanged. The study contributes to developing green hybrid materials for VOC removal, showcasing potential applications across industries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interaction of the Immune System TIM&#8208;3 Protein with a Model Cellular Membrane Containing Phosphatidyl&#8208;Serine Lipids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 22, April 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report molecular modeling and simulation of the specific recognition of Phosphatidyl serine&#8211;containing lipids and TIM&#8208;3 immune system agent, which is particularly present in natural killer and T&#8208;cells. We also identify the thermodynamic of the interaction process, using enhanced sampling molecular dynamics.







Abstract
T cell transmembrane, Immunoglobulin, and Mucin (TIM) are important immune system proteins which are especially present in T&#8208;cells and regulated the immune system by sensing cell engulfment and apoptotic processes. Their role is exerted by the capacity to detect the presence of phosphatidyl&#8211;serine lipid polar head in the outer leaflet of cellular membranes (correlated with apoptosis). In this contribution by using equilibrium and enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulation we unravel the molecular bases and the thermodynamics of TIM, and in particular TIM&#8208;3, interaction with phosphatidyl serine in a lipid bilayer. Since TIM&#8208;3 deregulation is an important factor of pro&#8208;oncogenic tumor micro&#8208;environment understanding its functioning at a molecular level may pave the way to the development of original immunotherapeutic approaches.

         <title>Electronic Structure Analysis of the A10Tt2P6 System (A=Li&#8722;Cs; Tt=Si, Ge, Sn) and Synthesis of the Direct Band Gap Semiconductor K10Sn2P6</title>

         <dc:description>
From observation via DFT calculations to synthesis: The temperature dependent stability of the two isomeric structures of A10Tt2P6 (A=Li&#8722;Cs; Tt=Si&#8722;Sn) comprising ether trigonal planar TtP35&#8722; units or the dimerization product [Tt2P6]10&#8722; are calculated. Subsequently the crystal structure of K10Sn2P6 with [Sn2P6]10&#8722; dimers is predicted and synthesized accordingly. Further on property calculations reveal why compounds prefer one structure over the other.







Abstract
Investigating the relationship between atomic and electronic structures is a powerful tool to screen the wide variety of Zintl phases for interesting (opto&#8722;)electronic properties. To get an insight in such relations, the A10Tt2P6 system (A=Li&#8722;Cs; Tt=Si&#8722;Sn) was picked as model system to analyse the influence of structural motives, combination of elements and their properties on type and width of the band gaps. Those compounds comprise two interesting structural motives of their anions, which are either monomeric trigonal planar TtP35&#8722; units which are isostructural to CO32&#8722; or [Tt2P6]10&#8722; dimers which correspond to two edge&#8208;sharing TtP4 tetrahedra. The A10Tt2P6 compounds were structurally optimized for both polymorphs and subsequent frequency analysis, band structure as well as density of states calculations were performed. The Gibbs free energies were compared to determine temperature dependent stability, where Na10Si2P6, Na10Ge2P6 and K10Sn2P6 were found to be candidates for a high temperature phase transition between the two polymorphs. Additionally, the unknown, but predicted compound K10Sn2P6 was synthesized and characterized by single crystal and powder x&#8208;ray diffraction. It crystalizes in the monoclinic space group P 21/n and incorporates [Sn2P6]10&#8722; edge sharing double tetrahedra. It was determined to be a direct band gap semiconductor with a band gap of 2.57&#8197;eV.

Abstract
Four donor&#8208;acceptor boron difluoride complexes based on the carbazole electron donor and the [1,3,5,2]oxadiazaborinino[3,4&#8208;a][1,8]naphthyridine acceptor were designed, synthesized, and systematically spectroscopically investigated in solutions, in dye&#8208;doped polymer films, and in the solid states. The dyes exhibit an intense blue to red solid&#8208;state emission with photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 59&#8201;% in pure dye samples and 86&#8201;% in poly(methyl methacrylate) films. All boron complexes show aggregation&#8208;induced emission and reversible mechanofluorochromism. The optical properties of these dyes and their solid state luminescence can be tuned by substitution pattern, i.&#8201;e., the substituents at the naphthyridine unit. Exchange of CH3&#8208; for CF3&#8208;groups does not only increase the intramolecular charge transfer character, but also provides a crystallization&#8208;induced emission enhancement.

         <title>Computational Study Into the Oxidative Ring&#8208;Closure Mechanism During the Biosynthesis of Deoxypodophyllotoxin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 22, April 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insert text for Table of Contents here. Density functional theory calculations on large enzymatic cluster models of deoxypodophyllotoxin synthase shows that substrate (&#8722;)&#8208;yatein reacts efficiently through a radical reaction mechanism to form the oxidative ring&#8208;closure, while the OH rebound is prevented through electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions to the oxidant that guide the selectivity of the reaction.







Abstract
The nonheme iron dioxygenase deoxypodophyllotoxin synthase performs an oxidative ring&#8208;closure reaction as part of natural product synthesis in plants. How the enzyme enables the oxidative ring&#8208;closure reaction of (&#8722;)&#8208;yatein and avoids substrate hydroxylation remains unknown. To gain insight into the reaction mechanism and understand the details of the pathways leading to products and by&#8208;products we performed a comprehensive computational study. The work shows that substrate is bound tightly into the substrate binding pocket with the C7&#8217;&#8722;H bond closest to the iron(IV)&#8208;oxo species. The reaction proceeds through a radical mechanism starting with hydrogen atom abstraction from the C7&#8217;&#8722;H position followed by ring&#8208;closure and a final hydrogen transfer to form iron(II)&#8208;water and deoxypodophyllotoxin. Alternative mechanisms including substrate hydroxylation and an electron transfer pathway were explored but found to be higher in energy. The mechanism is guided by electrostatic perturbations of charged residues in the second&#8208;coordination sphere that prevent alternative pathways.

Density functional theory calculations on large enzymatic cluster models of deoxypodophyllotoxin synthase shows that substrate (&#8722;)-yatein reacts efficiently through a radical reaction mechanism to form the oxidative ring-closure, while the OH rebound is prevented through electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions to the oxidant that guide the selectivity of the reaction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nonheme iron dioxygenase deoxypodophyllotoxin synthase performs an oxidative ring-closure reaction as part of natural product synthesis in plants. How the enzyme enables the oxidative ring-closure reaction of (&#8722;)-yatein and avoids substrate hydroxylation remains unknown. To gain insight into the reaction mechanism and understand the details of the pathways leading to products and by-products we performed a comprehensive computational study. The work shows that substrate is bound tightly into the substrate binding pocket with the C&lt;sub&gt;7&#8217;&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;H bond closest to the iron(IV)-oxo species. The reaction proceeds through a radical mechanism starting with hydrogen atom abstraction from the C&lt;sub&gt;7&#8217;&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;H position followed by ring-closure and a final hydrogen transfer to form iron(II)-water and deoxypodophyllotoxin. Alternative mechanisms including substrate hydroxylation and an electron transfer pathway were explored but found to be higher in energy. The mechanism is guided by electrostatic perturbations of charged residues in the second-coordination sphere that prevent alternative pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated BPC catalyzed late&#8208;stage solution phase desulfonylation from tryptophan, tyrosine and histidine amino acid residues in oligopeptides is presented herein, by overcoming the isolation issue up to octamers. Additionally, organophotocatalyst BPC demonstrates efficient solution&#8208;phase phenacyl deprotection from C&#8208;terminal in peptides. This effective and mild strategy portrayes exceptional selectivity by tolerating a wide range of functional groups in heteroaromatics and peptides.







Abstract
Herein, BPC catalyzed visible&#8208;light&#8208;triggered target&#8208;specific late&#8208;stage solution phase desulfonylation from tryptophan in oligopeptides is portrayed by overcoming the isolation issue up to octamers. This robust and mild method is highly predictable and chemoselective, tolerating myriad of functional groups in aza&#8208;heteroaromatics and peptides. Interestingly, reductive desulfonylation is also amenable to biologically significant reactive histidine and tyrosine side chains, signifying the versatility of the strategy. Additional efficacy of BPC is demonstrated by solution phase phenacyl deprotection from C&#8208;terminal in peptides. Furthermore, excellent catalyst loading of 0.5&#8197;mol% and recyclability demonstrate the practical utility and applicability of this strategy.

         <title>Spiropyran&#8208;Based Photoisomerizable &#945;&#8208;Amino Acid for Membrane&#8208;Active Peptide Modification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 22, April 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spiropyran&#8208;derived &#945;&#8208;amino acid was carefully designed for the synthesis of photocontrollable bioactive peptides. Dramatic changes in structure and polarity occurring upon light exposure or dark adaptation of the spiropyran side chain can cause changes in the behavior of peptides in lipid membranes and living cells, as demonstrated on spiropyran&#8208;containing analogs of the membrane&#8208;active peptide BP100 (KKLFKKILKYL&#8208;NH2).







Abstract
Photoisomerizable peptides are promising drug candidates in photopharmacology. While azobenzene&#8208; and diarylethene&#8208;containing photoisomerizable peptides have already demonstrated their potential in this regard, reports on the use of spiropyrans to photoregulate bioactive peptides are still scarce. This work focuses on the design and synthesis of a spiropyran&#8208;derived amino acid, (S)&#8208;2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;(6'&#8208;methoxy&#8208;1',3',3'&#8208;trimethylspiro&#8208;[2H&#8208;1&#8208;benzopyran&#8208;2,2'&#8208;indolin&#8208;6&#8208;yl])propanoic acid, which is suitable for the preparation of photoisomerizable peptides. The utility of this amino acid is demonstrated by incorporating it into the backbone of BP100, a known membrane&#8208;active peptide, and by examining the photoregulation of the membrane perturbation by the spiropyran&#8208;containing peptides. The toxicity of the peptides (against the plant cell line BY&#8208;2), their bacteriotoxicity (E.&#8197;coli), and actin&#8211;auxin oscillator modulation ability were shown to be significantly dependent on the photoisomeric state of the spiropyran unit.

         <title>Engineering Detrimental Functional Groups in Conductive Additives Toward High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>

Hydrogen thermal reduction process removed oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups on the surface of Super&#8197;P, thereby weakening interface side reactions with sulfide benefits Li&#8208;ion migration. Only 1&#8197;wt&#8201;% reduced Super&#8197;P based ASSLBs exhibited better reversible capacity of 180.2&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;C and high capacity retention of 81.8&#8201;% after 40&#8197;cycles, and 130.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 64.6&#8201;% for Super&#8197;P.







Abstract
Conductive additives are of great importance for the adequate utilization of active materials in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries by establishing conductive networks in the composite cathode. However, it usually causes severe interfacial side reactions with solid electrolytes, especially sulfide electrolytes, leading to sluggish ion transportation and accelerated performance degradation. Herein, a simple hydrogen thermal reduction process is proposed on a commonly used conductive additive Super&#8197;P, which effectively removes the surface oxygen functional groups and weakens the interfacial side reactions with sulfide. With a small amount of 1&#8197;wt&#8201;% reduced Super&#8197;P, ASSLBs demonstrates a competitive capacity of 180.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, which is much higher than the 130.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 of untreated Super&#8197;P. Impressively, reduced Super&#8197;P based ASSLBs also exhibit a higher capacity retention of 81.8&#8201;% than 64.6&#8201;% of untreated Super&#8197;P. The cathode interfacial chemical evolutions reveal that reduced Super&#8197;P could effectively alleviate the side reactions of sulfide. Reduced Super&#8197;P shows better reversible capacity compared to reduced carbon nanofiber with almost no loss of capacity retention, due to its more complete conductive network. Our results highlight the importance of oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups for conductive additives, lightening the prospect of low&#8208;cost 0D conductive additives for practical ASSLBs.

         <title>A Versatile, Functional Group&#8208;Tolerant, and Bench&#8208;Stable Iron Precatalyst for Building Arene and Triazine Rings by [2+2+2] Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 22, April 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new [2+2+2] cycloaddition procedure relying on the use of an air&#8208;stable iron precatalyst is described, which allows the construction of aromatic and nitrogen&#8208;containing heteroaromatic rings in green solvents and mild conditions. Cycloadditions and cross&#8208;cycloadditions between 1,6&#8208; or 1,7&#8208;diynes and alkynes are reported, with a broad functional tolerance, leading to a variety of functionalizable scaffolds.







Abstract
We report an efficient iron&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition procedure leading to the construction of (hetero)aromatic rings by alkyne [2+2+2] cycloisomerization. This method relies on the use of an air&#8208;stable (N,N)Fe(II) precursor easily prepared from a commercially available ligand derived from 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, reduced in&#8197;situ into a catalytically active non&#8208;innocent (N,N &#8901;&#8722;)2Fe(II) species. This system displays a large scope application, operates under mild conditions and at low catalytic charges (25 cycloadducts formed, up to 1.5&#8197;mol% catalyst). Moreover, this method also enables access to 29 cycloadducts by cross&#8208;cycloisomerization between 1,6&#8208; or 1,7&#8208;diynes and alkynes in near&#8208;equimolar conditions. 1,3,5&#8208;Triazines can also be prepared with this procedure starting from the corresponding cyanamides. Scale&#8208;up reactions and post&#8208;functionalization of several cycloadducts also show that this [2+2+2] cycloaddition can be used in multistep sequences.

Scale-up reactions and post-functionalization of several cycloadducts also show that this [2+2+2] cycloaddition can be used in multistep sequences.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Synthesis of B&#8592;N Adducts by the Amine&#8208;Facilitated Trimerization of the Phenylboronic Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 22, April 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical synthesis of boroxine&#8208;amine adducts was monitored by in&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy and ex&#8208;situ PXRD. Amine is exchanged in 3&#8201;:&#8201;1 adducts by a stronger amine. Experimental and DFT data show that both 3&#8201;:&#8201;1 and 3&#8201;:&#8201;2 adducts (with same or different amines) form if pKa(amine)&gt;8, that was evidenced by the first crystal structure with two different amines (DMAP and piperidine) bound to one boroxine.







Abstract
Stable boroxine&#8208;amine adducts comprising dative B&#8592;N bond(s) were prepared by mechanochemically&#8208;induced reactions of phenylboronic acid (PBA) and amines (pyridine, DMAP, 1H&#8208;pyrazole, piperidine, DABCO, hexamethylenetetramine, or 4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine). In&#8208;situ Raman monitoring, ex&#8208;situ PXRD and DFT calculations were used for product identification. Stoichiometry of the product (3&#8201;:&#8201;1, 3&#8201;:&#8201;2 or 6&#8201;:&#8201;1 adduct) was controlled by the amine structure and the molar ratio of the reactants. The 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 H&#8208;bonded assembly of PBA and 4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (bpy) was confirmed as an intermediate in the adduct formation for bpy. Competitive binding experiments indicated that the exchange of the amines in the 3&#8201;:&#8201;1 adducts follows the computed adduct stabilities that increase with the amine basicity. Following the DFT prediction, the first adduct with two different amines, DMAP and pip, bound to one boroxine moiety was isolated and structurally characterized. Results show that calculations can be used to predict possible and preferred product(s) and their spectral characteristics.

         <title>Targeting of G&#8208;quadruplex DNA with 99mTc(I)/Re(I) Tricarbonyl Complexes Carrying Pyridostatin Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 22, April 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
New (Radio)metalated G4 binders: Re(I) and 99mTc(I) complexes carrying pyridostatin derivatives for the targeting of G&#8208;quadruplex structures. The Re complex can bind to G4 DNA and RNA with selectivity over double&#8208;stranded DNA, exhibiting cytotoxic activity in MCF&#8208;7 human breast cancer and PC3 human prostate cancer cell lines. The 99mTc congener is stable in&#8197;vivo with a fast blood clearance in normal mice.







Abstract
The main goal of this work was to elucidate the potential relevance of (radio)metal chelates of 99mTc and Re targeting G&#8208;quadruplex structures for the design of new tools for cancer theranostics. 99mTc provides the complexes with the ability to perform single&#8208;photon&#8208;emission computed tomography imaging studies, while the Re complexes should act as anticancer agents upon interaction with specific G4 DNA or RNA structures present in tumor tissues. Towards this goal, we have developed isostructural 99mTc(I) and Re(I) tricarbonyl complexes anchored by a pyrazolyl&#8208;diamine (Pz) chelator carrying a pendant pyridostatin (PDS) fragment as the G4&#8208;binding motif. The interaction of the PDF&#8208;Pz&#8208;Re (8) complex with different G4&#8208;forming oligonucleotides was studied by circular dichroism, fluorescence spectroscopy and FRET&#8208;melting assays. The results showed that the Re complex retained the ability to bind and stabilize G4&#8208;structures from different DNA or RNA sequences, namely those present on the SRC proto&#8208;oncogene and telomeric RNA (TERRA sequence). PDF&#8208;Pz&#8208;Re (8) showed low to moderate cytotoxicity in PC3 and MCF&#8208;7 cancer cell lines, as typically observed for G4&#8208;binders. Biodistribution studies of the congener PDF&#8208;Pz&#8208;99mTc (12) in normal mice showed that the complex undergoes a fast blood clearance with a predominant hepatobiliary excretion, pointing also for a high in&#8197;vitro stability.

         <title>Access to a peri&#8208;Annulated Aluminium Compound via C&#8722;H Bond Activation by a Cyclic Bis&#8208;Aluminylene</title>

KC8 reduction of 2&#8208;I with a catalytic amount the NHC (IMe4) has been shown to afford the peri&#8208;annulated compound 4 as a colorless crystalline solid. The formation of 4 suggests intramolecular insertion of the putative bis&#8208;aluminylene 3 into the C&#8722;H bonds of HCMe2 groups. Calculations predict singlet ground state for 3 while the conversion of 3 into 4 is thermodynamically favored by 61&#8197;kcal/mol.







Abstract
Carbocyclic aluminium halides [(ADC)AlX2]2 (2&#8208;X) (X=F, Cl, and I) based on an anionic dicarbene (ADC=PhC{N(Dipp)C}2, Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) framework are prepared as crystalline solids by dehydrohalogenations of the alane [(ADC)AlH2]2 (1). KC8 reduction of 2&#8208;I affords the peri&#8208;annulated Al(III) compound [(ADCH)AlH]2 (4) (ADCH=PhC{N(Dipp)C2(DippH)N}, DippH=2&#8208;iPr,6&#8208;(Me2C)C6H3)) as a colorless crystalline solid in 76&#8201;% yield. The formation of 4 suggests intramolecular insertion of the putative bis&#8208;aluminylene species [(ADC)Al]2 (3) into the methine C&#8722;H bond of HCMe2 group. Calculations predict singlet ground state for 3, while the conversion of 3 into 4 is thermodynamically favored by 61&#8197;kcal/mol. Compounds 2&#8208;F, 2&#8208;Cl, 2&#8208;I, and 4 have been characterized by NMR spectroscopy and their solid&#8208;state molecular structures have been established by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Triplet Energy Transfer Mechanism in Copper Photocatalytic N&#8208; and O&#8208;Methylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 22, April 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We investigated the photochemical energy transfer mechanism of hypervalent iodine reagents. When coupled to copper catalysis we achieved successful methylation of a diverse set of N&#8208;heterocycles and (hetero&#8722;)aromatic carboxylic acids. In addition, we could show application of this methodology to more complex active pharmaceutical intermediates. Mechanistic investigations support our observations and provide the basis for future developments.







Abstract
Methylation reactions are chemically simple but challenging to perform under mild and non&#8208;toxic conditions. A photochemical energy transfer strategy was merged with copper catalysis to enable fast reaction times of minutes and broad applicability to N&#8208;heterocycles, (hetero&#8722;)aromatic carboxylic acids, and drug&#8208;like molecules in high yields and good functional group tolerance. Detailed mechanistic investigations, using kinetic analysis, aprotic MS, UV/Vis, and luminescence quenching experiments revealed a triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer mechanism between hypervalent iodine(III) reagents and readily available photosensitizers.

     alt="Triplet Energy Transfer Mechanism in Copper Photocatalytic N- and O-Methylation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We investigated the photochemical energy transfer mechanism of hypervalent iodine reagents. When coupled to copper catalysis we achieved successful methylation of a diverse set of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocycles and (hetero&#8722;)aromatic carboxylic acids. In addition, we could show application of this methodology to more complex active pharmaceutical intermediates. Mechanistic investigations support our observations and provide the basis for future developments.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Impact of the Methylene Bridge Substitution in Chelating NHC&#8208;Phosphine Mn(I) Catalyst for Ketone Hydrogenation</title>

Bridge substituent matters: the incorporation of phenyl group into the methylene bridge of bidentate phosphine&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand leads to significant increase of catalytic performance for the corresponding Mn(I) complex. Mechanistic studies revealed that this effect was caused by stabilization of key metal intermediates including a highly reactive anionic hydride complex due to more efficient negative charge delocalization.







Abstract
Systematic modification of the chelating NHC&#8208;phosphine ligand (NHC = N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) in highly efficient ketone hydrogenation Mn(I) catalyst fac&#8208;[(Ph2PCH2NHC)Mn(CO)3Br] has been performed and the catalytic activity of the resulting complexes was evaluated using acetophenone as a benchmark substrate. While the variation of phosphine and NHC moieties led to inferior results than for a parent system, the incorporation of a phenyl substituent into the ligand methylene bridge improved catalytic performance by ca. 3 times providing maximal TON values in the range of 15000&#8211;20000. Mechanistic investigation combining experimental and computational studies allowed to rationalize this beneficial effect as an enhanced stabilization of reaction intermediates including anionic hydride species fac&#8208;[(Ph2PC(Ph)NHC)Mn(CO)3H]&#8722; playing a crucial role in the hydrogenation process. These results highlight the interest of such carbon bridge substitution strategy being rarely employed in the design of chemically non&#8208;innocent ligands.

Unveiling the structure of new pertechnetate derivatives: a journey through 1d and 2d supramolecular polymer formation dictated by matere bonds in combination with hydrogen bonds.







Abstract
In this manuscript we evaluate the X&#8208;ray structure of five new pertechnetate derivatives of general formula [M(H2O)4(TcO4)2], M=Mg, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn (compounds 1&#8211;5) and one perrhenate compound Zn(H2O)4(ReO4)2 (6). In these complexes the metal center exhibits an octahedral coordination with the pertechnetate units as axial ligands. All compounds exhibit the formation of directional Tc&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O Matere bonds (MaBs) that propagate the [M(H2O)4(TcO4)2], into 1D supramolecular polymers in the solid state. Such 1D polymers are linked, generating 2D layers, by combining additional MaBs and hydrogen bonds (HBs). Such concurrent motifs have been analyzed theoretically, suggesting the noncovalent &#963;&#8208;hole nature of the MaBs. The interaction energies range from weak (~ &#8722;2&#8197;kcal/mol) for the MaBs to strong (~ &#8722;30&#8197;kcal/mol) for the MaB+HB assemblies, where HB dominates. In case of M=Zn, the corresponding perrhenate Zn(H2O)4(ReO4)2 complex, has been also synthesized for comparison purposes, resulting in the formation of an isostructural X&#8208;ray structure, corroborating the structure&#8208;directing role of Matere bonds.

Drug development strategy: Re and 99mTc tricarbonyl complexes with a pyridostatin moiety as a G4&#8208;binding motif have been obtained through a post&#8208;conjugation strategy using Pz&#8208;COOH&#8208;M. Metalation was found to enhance the complexes&#8217; cytotoxicity in two cancer cell lines; the 99mTc congener was used to study binding and internalization. Possible uses of the complexes for DNA&#8208;interaction, cell and biodistribution studies are illustrated. More information can be found in the Research Article by E. Palma, A. Paulo and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400285).

         <title>Photopharmacology of Protease Inhibitors: Current Status and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 22, April 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
No fear of the dark. Photopharmacology is an emerging technique in which bioactive molecules are turned on (or turned off) by means of light. This enables a spatial and temporal control of their activity. In this review, we discuss the progress of photopharmacology in the field protease inhibitors.







Abstract
Proteases are involved in many essential biological processes. Dysregulation of their activity underlies a wide variety of human diseases. Photopharmacology, as applied on various classes of proteins, has the potential to assist protease research by enabling spatiotemporal control of protease activity. Moreover, it may be used to decrease side&#8208;effects of protease&#8208;targeting drugs. In this review, we discuss the current status of the chemical design of photoactivatable proteases inhibitors and their biological application. Additionally, we give insight into future possibilities for further development of this field of research.

         <title>Preparation of Dinitrogen Trioxide for Organic Synthesis: A Phase Equilibrium Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 22, April 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dinitrogen trioxide (N2O3) is a potent and atom economic nitrosating agent. The preparation of N2O3 is difficult due to its instability and entangled chemical and phase equilibria. This review reexamines the preparative methods of pure N2O3 and its concentrated (&gt;0.1&#8197;M) solutions via a phase equilibrium approach in combination with worked examples in organic synthesis.







Abstract
Dinitrogen trioxide (N2O3) is a potent nitrosating agent featured with high reactivity and appealing atom economy. Because of its instability and the entanglement of chemical and phase equilibria, N2O3 has rarely been utilized in organic synthesis as a stock reagent with well&#8208;defined composition. In this review, the preparations of pure N2O3 and its concentrated solution (&gt;0.1&#8197;M) are discussed from the aspect of phase equilibrium. Understanding the physical and chemical characteristics of N2O3, along with how reaction parameters (temperature, pressure, molar ratio) interact, plays a crucial role in managing the concentration of N2O3 in the liquid phase. This control holds practical significance in achieving quantitative reactions.

         <title>Masters of Mediation: MN(SiMe3)2 in Functionalization of C(sp3)&#8722;H Latent Nucleophiles</title>

MN(SiMe3)2 mediated various functionalization of C(sp3)&#8722;H latent nucleophiles is summarized in this minireview. These alkali metal chemistries are competitive to the existing methodology, and performs unusual organic transformations, thus opening up new vistas in organic synthesis.







Abstract
Organoalkali compounds have undergone a far&#8208;reaching transformation being a coupling partner to a mediator in unusual organic conversions which finds its spot in the field of sustainable synthesis. Transition&#8208;metal catalysis has always been the priority in C(sp3)&#8722;H bond functionalization, however alternatively, in recent times this has been seriously challenged by earth&#8208;abundant alkali metals and their complexes arriving at new sustainable organometallic reagents. In this line, the importance of MN(SiMe3)2 (M=Li, Na, K &amp; Cs) reagent revived in C(sp3)&#8722;H bond functionalization over recent years in organic synthesis is showcased in this minireview. MN(SiMe3)2 reagent with higher reactivity, enhanced stability, and bespoke cation&#8208;&#960; interaction have shown eye&#8208;opening mediated processes such as C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) cross&#8208;coupling, radical&#8208;radical cross&#8208;coupling, aminobenzylation, annulation, aroylation, and other transformations to utilize readily available petrochemical feedstocks. This article also emphasizes the unusual reactivity of MN(SiMe3)2 reagent in unreactive and robust C&#8722;X (X=O, N, F, C) bond cleavage reactions that occurred alongside the C(sp3)&#8722;H bond functionalization. Overall, this review encourages the community to exploit the untapped potential of MN(SiMe3)2 reagent and also inspires them to take up this subject to even greater heights.

         <title>Naphthalene diimide&#8211;Annulated Heterocyclic Acenes: Synthesis, Electrochemical and Semiconductor Properties and their Multifaceted Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterocyclic naphthalene diimide (NDI) acenes and NDI hydroazaacenes possess unique and intriguing properties. This review explores the diverse range of synthetic routes as well as their versatile applications in areas such as sensors, semiconductors, optical and redox&#8211;switchable materials as well as in biology.







Abstract
Acenes and Naphthalene Diimides (NDIs) stand as distinguished classes of organic compounds, each possessing unique and intriguing properties that have garnered significant attention across various scientific disciplines. Acenes, characterized by linearly fused aromatic rings, have captivated researchers due to their diverse electronic structures and promising applications in materials science. On the other hand, NDIs, known for their distinctive electron&#8211;accepting properties, exhibit remarkable versatility in fields ranging from organic electronics, supramolecular to spin chemistry. In this review, we navigate through the fascinating realms of both acenes and NDIs before converging our focus on the highly diverse and distinctive subgroup of NDI&#8211;annulated heterocyclic acenes. This potentially important subgroup, has emerged as a subject of intense investigation, encapsulating their fascinating synthesis, optical and electrochemical characteristics, and multifaceted applications that span the realms of chemistry, physics, and biology. Through the exploration of their synthetic strategies, unique properties, and diverse applications, this review aims to offer a comprehensive understanding of the pivotal role played by NDI&#8208;based heterocyclic acenes in contemporary multidisciplinary research and technological innovation.

         <title>Interfacial Bonding Induced Charge Transfer in Two&#8208;Dimensional Amorphous MoO3&#8208;x/Graphdiyne Oxide Non&#8208;Van der Waals Heterostructures for Dominant SERS Enhancement</title>

         <dc:description>
2D amorphous non&#8208;van der Waals MoO3&#8208;x/GDYO heterostructures obtained by supercritical CO2 exhibit excellent Surface&#8208;enhanced Raman Scattering performance in detecting methylene blue (10&#8722;14&#8197;M) with the enhancement factor of 2.55&#215;1011 due to the interfacial bonding induced charge transfer.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional semiconductor&#8208;based nanomaterials have shown to be an effective substrate for Surface&#8208;enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) spectroscopy. However, the enhancement factor (EF) tends to be relatively weak compared to that of noble metals and does not allow for trace detection of molecules. In this work, we report the successful preparation of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) amorphous non&#8208;van der Waals heterostructures MoO3&#8208;x/GDYO nanomaterials using supercritical CO2. Due to the synergistic effect of the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect and the charge transfer effect, it exhibits excellent SERS performance in the detection of methylene blue (MB) molecules, with a detection limit as low as 10&#8722;14&#8197;M while the enhancement factor (EF) can reach an impressive 2.55&#215;1011. More importantly, the chemical bond bridging at the MoO3&#8208;x/GDYO heterostructures interface can accelerate the electron transfer between the interfaces, and the large number of defective surface structures on the heterostructures surface facilitates the chemisorption of MB molecules. And the charge recombination lifetime can be proved by a ~1.7&#8208;fold increase during their interfacial electron&#8208;transfer process for MoO3&#8208;x/GDYO@MB mixture, achieving highly sensitive SERS detection.

         <title>7Li NMR Spectroscopy: a Tool for Determining Dimerization Constants and Averaged Dimerization Constants of the Monomer/Dimer Equilibrium of Hierarchical Helicates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
7Li NMR is a perfect tool for the evaluation of supramolecular aggregates. In case of titanium(IV) based hierarchical helicates dimerization as well as averaged dimerization constants are determined and the expansion and compression of molecular switches is followed. Thus, 7Li NMR helps to understand phenomena far beyond the simple observation of a heteroatom resonance in solution or in the solid.







Abstract
7Li nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is an ideal tool to study hierarchically assembled helicates of the form Li[Li3L6Ti2]. Internally bound and external lithium ions can be well distinguished by solution&#8208; or solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and dimerization constants of the monomer/dimer equilibrium can be easily determined in solution. Averaged dimerization constants can be estimated in case of statistical mixtures of helicates formed from mixtures of ligands.

         <title>Not All Binding Sites Are Equal: Site Determination and Folding State Analysis of Gas&#8208;Phase Protein&#8208;Metallodrug Adducts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Mass spectrometric studies showed that the anticancer agent RAPTA&#8208;C binds most effectively to ubiquitin and myoglobin over cytochrome c and lysozyme via coordination to His and/or Met residues. While coordination of [Ru(cym)] to ubiquitin at Met1 caused a large compaction of the native&#8208;like protein, [Ru(cym)(PTA)] adducts had negligible effects, as also observed for myoglobin.







Abstract
Modern approaches in metallodrug research focus on compounds that bind protein targets rather than DNA. However, the identification of protein targets and binding sites is challenging. Using intact mass spectrometry and proteomics, we investigated the binding of the antimetastatic agent RAPTA&#8208;C to the model proteins ubiquitin, cytochrome c, lysozyme, and myoglobin. Binding to cytochrome c and lysozyme was negligible. However, ubiquitin bound up to three Ru moieties, two of which were localized at Met1 and His68 as [Ru(cym)], and [Ru(cym)] or [Ru(cym)(PTA)] adducts, respectively. Myoglobin bound up to four [Ru(cym)(PTA)] moieties and five sites were identified at His24, His36, His64, His81/82 and His113. Collision&#8208;induced unfolding (CIU) studies via ion&#8208;mobility mass spectrometry allowed measuring protein folding as a function of collisional activation. CIU of protein&#8211;RAPTA&#8208;C adducts showed binding of [Ru(cym)] to Met1 caused a significant compaction of ubiquitin, likely from N&#8208;terminal S&#8722;Ru&#8722;N chelation, while binding of [Ru(cym)(PTA)] to His residues of ubiquitin or myoglobin induced a smaller effect. Interestingly, the folded state of ubiquitin formed by His functionalization was more stable than Met1 metalation. The data suggests that selective metalation of amino acids at different positions on the protein impacts the conformation and potentially the biological activity of anticancer compounds.

         <title>Development of Biocompatible Cu(I)&#8208;Microdevices for Bioorthogonal Uncaging and Click Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report the development of solid&#8208;supported Cu(I) catalysts and their application in bioorthogonal uncaging and click reactions. Polymeric devices featuring a range of tridentate ligands and off&#8208;on Cu(I)&#8208;sensitive sensors were developed and tested under conditions compatible with life. We also present a preliminary exploration of their use for in&#8197;situ PROTAC synthesis through CuAAC assembly of two heterofunctional mating units.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed bioorthogonal reactions emerged a decade ago as a novel strategy to implement spatiotemporal control over enzymatic functions and pharmacological interventions. The use of this methodology in experimental therapy is driven by the ambition of improving the tolerability and PK properties of clinically&#8208;used therapeutic agents. The preclinical potential of bioorthogonal catalysis has been validated in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo with the in&#8197;situ generation of a broad range of drugs, including cytotoxic agents, anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs and anxiolytics. In this article, we report our investigations towards the preparation of solid&#8208;supported Cu(I)&#8208;microdevices and their application in bioorthogonal uncaging and click reactions. A range of ligand&#8208;functionalized polymeric devices and off&#8208;on Cu(I)&#8208;sensitive sensors were developed and tested under conditions compatible with life. Last, we present a preliminary exploration of their use for the synthesis of PROTACs through CuAAC assembly of two heterofunctional mating units.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Analogues of Wittig Hydrocarbon</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) analogues of Wittig hydrocarbon, i.&#8201;e. [(NHC)2(Stil)] have been reported as crystalline solids. One&#8208;electron oxidations of [(NHC)2(Stil)] afford radical cations [(NHC)2(Stil)]&#8901;+, which can be further oxidized into the dications [(NHC)2(Stil)]2+.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) analogues of Wittig hydrocarbon, [(NHC)(Stil)(NHC)] (3a&#8208;c) (NHC = SIPr (1a) = C[N(Dipp)CH2]2, Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3; IPr (1b) = C[N(Dipp)CH]2; Me&#8208;IPr (1c) = C[N(Dipp)CMe]2 and Stil = C6H4CHCHC6H4) have been reported as crystalline solids. 3a&#8208;c are prepared by two&#8208;electron reductions of the corresponding bis&#8208;1,3&#8208;imidazoli(ni)um bromides [(NHC)(Stil)NHC)](Br)2 (2a&#8208;c) with KC8 in &gt;94&#8201;% yields. 2a&#8208;c are accessible by the nickel catalyzed direct C&#8722;C coupling of NHCs (1a&#8208;c) with (E)&#8208;4,4'&#8208;dibromostilbene. One&#8208;electron oxidation of 3a,b yields the corresponding radical cations [(NHC)(Stil)NHC)]B(C6F5)4 4a,b. All compounds have been characterized by UV&#8208;Vis/NMR/EPR spectroscopy as well as 2a, 3a, and 3b by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The electronic structures of representative systems have been analyzed by quantum chemical calculations.

         <title>Continuous Synthesis of a Macrocyclic Sulfite of Polyethylene Glycol by Cascaded Continuous Stirred Tank Reactors (CSTRs)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel continuous process is proposed for the synthesis of a macrocyclic sulfite of tetra(ethylene glycol), PEG4&#8208;MCSi, which is a precursor to the useful building block PEG4&#8208;macrocyclic sulfate, PEG4&#8208;MCS. The system at the core of this work is a set of cascaded continuously stirred tank reactors (portrayed aesthetically in the illustration) containing the reaction mixtures. The core features of this work are listed. More information can be found in the Research Article by L. Pan and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202304319).

         <title>Perfect Polar Alignment of Parallel Beloamphiphile Layers: Improved Structural Design Bias Realized in Ferroelectric Crystals of the Novel &#8220;Methoxyphenyl Series of Acetophenone Azines&#8221;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new series of ferroelectric molecular crystals is described: the methoxyphenyl acetophenone azines, (MeO&#8722;Ph, Y)&#8208;azines with Y=F (1), Cl (2), Br (3), or I (4). The crystals of 1&#8211;4 not only exhibit the desired polar stacking of beloamphiphile monolayers (PBAMs), but the results exceed expectations. Crystals 1&#8211;4 feature planar biphenyl moieties enhancing PBAM stability and NLO performance. Avoiding interlayer halogen bonding allows perfect polar stacking of PBAMs of fluoroazine 1. Chloroazine 2 presents a unique case of a kryptoracemate due to conformational helicity. More information can be found in the Research Article by R.

     alt="Perfect Polar Alignment of Parallel Beloamphiphile Layers: Improved Structural Design Bias Realized in Ferroelectric Crystals of the Novel &#8220;Methoxyphenyl Series of Acetophenone Azines&#8221;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A new series&lt;/b&gt; of ferroelectric molecular crystals is described: the methoxyphenyl acetophenone azines, (MeO&#8722;Ph, Y)-azines with Y=F (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), Cl (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), Br (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;), or I (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;). The crystals of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; not only exhibit the desired polar stacking of beloamphiphile monolayers (PBAMs), but the results exceed expectations. Crystals &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; feature &lt;i&gt;planar&lt;/i&gt; biphenyl moieties enhancing PBAM stability and NLO performance. Avoiding interlayer halogen bonding allows perfect polar stacking of PBAMs of fluoroazine &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;. Chloroazine &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; presents a unique case of a kryptoracemate due to conformational helicity. More information can be found in the Research Article by R. Glaser and co-workers (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202400182"&gt;10.1002/chem.202400182&lt;/a&gt;).

         <title>Selective B(3)&#8208;H activation without auxiliary reagents affording multinuclear Ir(III) complexes with (o&#8208;carboranyl)dithioester ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A method was developed to link two or three o&#8208;carborane moieties to form a series of carboranyl dithioester bridging ligands via in situ substitution of haloalkanes by tetraphenylphosphonium carboranyldithiocarboxylates. Based on these ligands, direct B&#8208;H activation without the assistance of Ag(I) and alkali was successfully achieved with half&#8208;sandwich Ir(III) substrate [Cp*IrCl2]2 to yield corresponding bimetallic or trimetallic complexes. Single crystal structure analyses of the B&#8208;H activated complexes and corresponding SnCl2&#8208;inserted derivatives confirm the selective B(3)&#8208;H activation in these complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the Magnetic Interactions in Two Novel Cyanide&#8208;bridged Homo&#8208; and Heterometallic Hexadecanuclear Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two novel isostructural cyanide&#8208;bridged hexadecanuclear complexes with the general formula {[Fe(CN)6]6[M{en(Bn)py}]10}2+ [M = Fe (12+), Ni (22+)] have been synthesized. The structural analyses disclose the presence of multivalent Fe centres with different spin states in complex 12+ whereas all the Fe centres share a conserved oxidation state in complex 22+. The DC magnetic study revealed antiferromagnetic interactions between the adjacent metal centres and ferrimagnetic behaviour in 12+. On the other hand, ferromagnetic interactions were observed in complex 22+ due to nearly orthogonal orientation of the interacting orbitals and poor spatial overlap as observed in BS&#8208;DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sensitive and reliable nanozyme&#8208;based sensor enables the detection of low concentrations of H2O2 in biological microenvironments, it has potential applications as an in&#8208;situ monitoring platform for cellular H2O2 release. The uniformly dispersed bimetallic sulfide (Zn2SnS4) nanoflowers were synthesized via a one&#8208;pot hydrothermal method and the two kinds of metal ions can serve as morphology and structure directing agents for each other in the synthetic process. The nanoparticles were utilized as nanozyme materials to fabricate a novel electrochemical sensor, and it exhibits a distinct electrochemical response towards H2O2 with excellent stability and detection capability (with a minimum detection limit of 1.79 nM (S/N = 3)), the excellent characteristics facilitate the precise detection of low concentrations of H2O2 in biological microenvironments. Use the macrophages differentiated from leukemia THP&#8208;1 cells as a representative sensing model, the sensor was successfully utilized for real&#8208;time monitoring of the release of H2O2 induced by living cells, which has significant potential applications in clinical diagnosis and cancer treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of Co&#8208;adsorbed Guest Adsorbates on the Separation of Ethylene/Ethane Mixtures on Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks with Open Metal Sites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct determination of the equilibrium adsorption and spectroscopic observation of adsorbent&#8208;adsorbate interaction is crucial to evaluate the olefin/paraffin separation performance of porous adsorbents. However, the experimental characterization of competitive adsorption of various adsorbates at atomic&#8208;molecular level in the purification of multicomponent gas mixtures is challenging but rarely conducted. Herein, solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy is employed to examine the effect of co&#8208;adsorbed guest adsorbates on the separation of ethylene/ethane mixtures on Mg&#8208;MOF&#8208;74, Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 and UTSA&#8208;74. 1H MAS NMR spectra facilitates the determination of equilibrium uptake and adsorption selectivity of ethylene/ethane in ternary mixture systems. The co&#8208;adsorption of H2O and CO2 significantly leads to the degradation of the ethylene uptake and ethylene/ethane selectivity. The detailed host&#8208;guest and guest&#8208;guest interactions are unraveled by 2D 1H&#8208;1H spin diffusion homo&#8208;nuclear correlation and static 25Mg NMR experiments. The experimental results verify H2O coordinated on the open metal sites can supply a new adsorption site for ethylene and ethane. The effects of guest adsorbates on the adsorption capacity and adsorption selectivity of the ethylene/ethane mixtures are in the following order: H2O &gt; CO2 &gt; O2. This work provides a direct approach for exploring the equilibrium adsorption and detailed separation mechanism of multicomponent gas mixtures using MOFs adsorbents.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Chiral metal&#8208;organic framework (CMOFs) is a kind of material with great application value in recent years. Formed by the coordination of metal ions or metal clusters with organic ligands. It is widely used in chemistry, biology, medicine and materials science because of its ordered and adjustable pores, multi&#8208;dimensional network structure, large specific surface area and excellent adsorption properties. In this paper, the synthesis strategies and preparation methods of chiral metal&#8208;organic frameworks are reviewed. In addition, the applications of chiral metal&#8208;organic framework materials in enantiomer recognition and separation, circularly polarized luminescence and asymmetric catalysis are systematically summarized. Finally, the challenges and prospects of the development of chiral metal&#8208;organic frame materials are analyzed in detail.</dc:description>

Moreover, gram&#8208;scale synthesis of the 10,10&#8208;difluoro&#8208;tetrahydropyrido[1,2&#8208;a]indole skeleton was successfully achieved without any reduction in both yield and enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetraanionic Oligo&#8208;Dioxaborines: Strongly Absorbing Near&#8208;Infrared Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymethine dyes of tetraanionic nature comprising 1,3,2&#8208;dioxaborine rings in the polymethine chain and end&#8208;groups of different electron&#8208;accepting abilities have been synthesized. They can be considered as oligomeric polymethines, where a linear conjugated &#960;&#8208;system passes through three 1,3,2&#8208;dioxaborine units and a number of tri&#8208; and dimethine &#960;&#8208;bridges between two end&#8208;groups. The obtained dyes exhibit near&#8208;infrared absorption and fluorescence, with molar absorption coefficients reaching as high as 564000 M&#8722;1cm&#8722;1 in DMF, rendering them among the strongest absorbers known. The novel compounds are bright NIR fluorophores, with fluorescence quantum yields up to 0.13 in DMF. A comparative analysis of the electronic structure of the obtained dyes with respective dianionic and trianionic oligomers was conducted through quantum chemical calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Modular DNA Reaction Networks for Signal Processing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diversified molecular information&#8208;processing methods have significant implications for nanoscale manipulation and control, monitoring and disease diagnosis of organisms, and direct intervention in biological activities. However, as an effective approach for implementing multifunctional molecular information processing, DNA reaction networks (DRNs) with numerous functionally specialized molecular structures have challenged them on scale and modular design, leading to increased network complexity, further causing problems such as signal leakage, attenuation, and cross&#8208;talk in network reactions. Our study developed a strategy for performing various signal&#8208;processing tasks through engineering modular DRNs composed of simple molecular structures. This strategy is based on a universal core unit with signal selection capability, and a timeadjustable signal self&#8208;resetting module is achieved by combing the core unit and self&#8208;resetting unit, which improves the time controllability of modular DRNs. In addition, multi&#8208;input and &#8208;output signal crosscatalytic and continuously adjustable signal delay modules were realized by combining core and threshold units, providing a flexible, precise method for modular DRNs to process the signal. The strategy simplifies the design of DRNs, helps generate design ideas for largescale integrated DRNs with multiple functions, and provides prospects in biocomputing, gene regulation, and biosensing.</dc:description>

         <title>Application of Sublimation in the Synthesis and Crystal Growth of Organosulfones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The solvent&#8208;free elimination of sulfinic acid and aromatization of 1,6&#8208;trans&#8208;substituted bis(arylsulfone) trienes is reported. It is shown that sublimation can be used as a &#8216;green&#8217; method to combine the thermal transformation of six trienes and the crystal growth of the resulting 4&#8208;(phenylsulfonyl)biphenyls. When the sublimation conditions are carefully controlled, high quality single crystals of the 4&#8208;(phenylsulfonyl)biphenyls are obtained. Theoretical modelling of the reaction using the simplified triene Ph&#8208;(CH)6&#8208;SO2H showed that the cyclization is energetically feasible and that the complete conversion is possible during the timescale of the sublimation. At temperatures slightly higher than the optimum sublimation temperature two of the trienes transformed into 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadienes that did not eliminate phenylsulfinic acid. A reaction mechanism involving a 1,3&#8208;hydrogen shift induced by free PhS. radicals is proposed for the formation of the 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadienes.</dc:description>

         <title>Classification and identification of perfume scents by an enantioselective colorimetric sensor array of chiral metal&#8208;organic&#8208;framework&#8208;based Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many odors, like perfumes, are complex mixtures of chiral and achiral molecules where the cost&#8208;efficient (enantio&#8208;)selective sensing represents a major technical challenge. Here, we present a colorimetric sensor array of surface&#8208;mounted metal&#8208;organic&#8208;framework (SURMOF) films in Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot (FP) cavities. The optical properties of the FP&#8208;SURMOF films with different chiral and achiral structures are affected by the (enantio&#8208;)selective adsorption of the analytes in the SURMOF pores, resulting in different responses to the analyte molecules. The read&#8208;out of the sensor array is performed by the digital camera of a common smartphone, where the RGB values are determined. By analyzing the sensor array data with simple machine learning algorithms, the analytes are discriminated. After demonstrating the enantioselective response for a pair of pure chiral odor molecules, we apply the sensor array to detect and discriminate a large number (16) of common commercial perfumes and eau de toilettes. While our untrained human nose is not able to discriminate all perfumes, the presented colorimetric sensor array can classify all perfumes with great classification accuracy. Moreover, the sensor array was used to identify unlabeled samples correctly. We foresee such an FP&#8208;chiral&#8208;SURMOF&#8208;based sensor array as a powerful approach toward inexpensive selective odors sensing applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformational and Electronic Variations in 1,2&#8208; and 1,6&#8208;Cyclophellitols and Their Impact on Retaining &#945;&#8208;Glucosidase Inhibition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>ABSTRACT: Glycoside hydrolases (glycosidases) take part in myriad biological processes and are important therapeutic targets. Competitive and mechanism&#8208;based inhibitors are useful tools to dissect their biological role and comprise a good starting point for drug discovery. The natural product, cyclophellitol, a mechanism&#8208;based, covalent and irreversible retaining &#946;&#8208;glucosidase inhibitor has inspired the design of diverse &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;glycosidase inhibitor and activity&#8208;based probe scaffolds. Here, we sought to deepen our understanding of the structural and functional requirements of cyclophellitol&#8208;type compounds for effective human &#945;&#8208;glucosidase inhibition. We synthesized a comprehensive set of &#945;&#8208;configured 1,2&#8208; and 1,6&#8208;cyclophellitol analogues bearing a variety of electrophilic traps. The inhibitory potency of these compounds was assessed towards both lysosomal and ER retaining &#945;&#8208;glucosidases. These studies revealed the 1,6&#8208;cyclophellitols to be the most potent retaining &#945;&#8208;glucosidase inhibitors, with the nature of the electrophile determining inhibitory mode of action (covalent or non&#8208;covalent). DFT calculations support the ability of the 1,6&#8208;cyclophellitols, but not the 1,2&#8208;congeners, to adopt conformations that mimic either the Michaelis complex or transition state of &#945;&#8208;glucosidases.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemistry of molecular gold compounds is dominated by the oxidation states +I and +III. For the intermediate oxidation state +II with 5d9 electron configuration, dimerization or disproportionation of the gold(II) radicals is favoured, so that only a few mononuclear gold(II) complexes have been isolated to date. The present study addresses the one&#8208;electron reduction of the macrocyclic gold(III) complex [AuIIIL]+ of the innocent &#946;&#8208;diketiminato ligand L2&#8211; with a 14membered macrocycle (L2&#8211; = 5,7,12,14&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,4,8,11tetraazacyclotetradeca&#8208;5,7,12,14&#8208;tetraenato). Electrochemistry, spectroelectrochemistry and chemical reduction of [AuIIIL]+ monitored by UV/Vis, NMR and EPR spectroscopy together with density functional theory calculations reveal disproportionation of the initially generated but elusive gold(II) complex AuIIL and provide guidelines for prospective stable mononuclear tetraazamacrocyclic gold(II) complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Highly Sterically Encumbered Boron Lewis Acid Enabled by a Organotellurium&#8208;based Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lewis acidic boron compounds are ubiquitous in chemistry due to their numerous applications, yet tuning and optimizing their properties towards different purposes is still a challenging field of research. In this work, the boron Lewis acid B[OTeF3(C6F5)2]3 was synthesized by reaction of the teflate derivative HOTeF3(C6F5)2 with BCl3 or BCl3&#183;SMe2. This new compound presents a remarkably high thermal stability up to 300 &#176;C, as well as one of the most sterically encumbered boron centres known in the literature. Theoretical and experimental methods revealed that B[OTeF3(C6F5)2]3 exhibits a comparable Lewis acidity to that of the well&#8208;known B(C6F5)3 and around 85% of the Lewis acidity of the related B(OTeF5)3. The affinity of B[OTeF3(C6F5)2]3 towards pyridine was accessed by Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) and compared to that of B(OTeF5)3 and B(C6F5)3. The ligand&#8208;transfer reactivity of this new boron compound towards different fluorides was demonstrated by the formation of an anionic Au(III) complex and a hypervalent iodine(III) species.</dc:description>

         <title>Azophosphines: Synthesis, Structure and Coordination Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The conceptual replacement of nitrogen with phosphorus in common organic functional groups unlocks new properties and reactivity. The phosphorus&#8208;containing analogues of triazenes are underexplored but offer great potential as flexible and small bite&#8208;angle ligands. This manuscript explores the synthesis and characterisation of a family of air&#8208;stable azophosphine&#8208;borane complexes, and their subsequent deprotection to the free azophosphines. These compounds are structurally characterised, both experimentally and computationally, and highlight the availability of the phosphorus lone pair for coordination. This is confirmed by demonstrating that neutral azophosphines can act as ligands in Ru complexes, and can coordinate as monodentate or bidentate ligands in a controlled manner, in contrast to their nitrogen analogues.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamics of Coordinated Phosphonate Group Directly Observed by 17O&#8208;NMR in Lanthanide(III) Complexes of a Mono(ethyl phosphonate) DOTA Analogue.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biological phosphates can coordinate metal ions and their complexes are common in living systems. Dynamics of mutual oxygen atom exchange in the tetrahedral group in complexes has not been investigated. Here, we present a direct experimental proof of the exchange (&#8220;phosphonate rotation&#8221;) in model Ln(III) complexes of monophosphonate H4dota analogue which alters phosphorus atom chirality of coordinated phosphonate monoester. Combination of macrocycle&#8208;based isomerism with P&#8208;based chirality leads to several diastereoisomers. The (non)&#8208;coordinated oxygens were distinguished through 17O&#8208;labelled phosphonate group and their mutual exchange was followed by various NMR techniques and DFT calculations. The process is sterically demanding and occurs through bulky bidentate (k2&#8208;PO2)&#8211; coordination. It was observed on complexes of large Ln(III) ions in twisted&#8208;square antiprism diastereoisomers. The process energy increases for smaller Ln(III) ions (298&#916;G&#8225;(exp./DFT) = 51.8/52.1 and 61.0 / 71.5 kJ mol&#8722;1 for La(III) and Eu(III), respectively). These results are helpful in design of such complexes for MRI and protein paramagnetic NMR probes. It demonstrates usefulness of 17O NMR to study solution dynamics in complexes involving phosphorus acid derivatives. The results may inspire use of this method to study dynamics of phosphoric acid derivatives (as e.g. phosphorus acid&#8208;based inhibitors of metalloenzymes) in different areas of chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Cascade: Efficient Synthesis of Cyclohepta[b]indoles and Cyclohepta[b]indole&#8208;Indoline Conjugates via RCM, Hydrogenation, and Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Ring Expansion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclohepta[b]indoles, prevalent in natural products and pharmaceuticals, are conventionally accessed via metal or Lewis acid&#8208;mediated cycloadditions with prefunctionalized substrates. Our study introduces an innovative sequential catalytic assembly for synthesizing cyclohepta[b]indoles from readily available isatin derivatives. The process involves three catalytic sequences: ring&#8208;closing metathesis, catalytic hydrogenation, and acid&#8208;catalyzed ring expansion. The RCM of 2,2&#8208;dialkene&#8208;3&#8208;oxindoles, formed by butenyl Grignard addition to 3&#8208;allyl&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;oxindoles, yields versatile spirocyclohexene&#8208;3&#8208;oxindole derivatives. These derivatives undergo further transformations, including dibromination, dihydroxylation, epoxidation, Wacker oxidation at the double bond. Hydrogenation of spirocyclohexene&#8208;3&#8208;oxindole yields spirocyclohexane&#8208;3&#8208;oxindoles. Their subsequent acid&#8208;catalyzed ring expansion/aromatization, dependent on the acid catalyst, results in either cyclohepta[b]indoles or cyclohepta[b]indole&#8208;indoline conjugates, adding a unique synthetic dimension. The utility of this methodology is exemplified through the synthesis of an A&#8208;FABP inhibitor, showcasing its potential in pharmaceutical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Variation in Catalytic Efficacies of a 2D pH&#8208;stable MOF by Altering Activation Methods</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although it is well&#8208;known that the Lewis acidity of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) can effectively enhance their catalytic activity in organic transformations, access to these Lewis&#8208;acidic sites remains a key hurdle to widespread applications of Lewis&#8208;acidic catalysis by MOFs. Easy accessibility of strong Lewis acidic sites onto 2D MOFs by using proper activation methods can be a cornerstone in attaining desired catalytic performance.&#160; Herein, we report a new 2D chemically stable MOF, IITKGP&#8208;60, which displayed excellent framework robustness over a wide pH range (2&#8208;12). Benefiting from the abundant open metal sites (OMSs) and framework robustness, the catalytic activity of the developed material was explored in one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component Strecker reaction and Knoevenagel condensation reaction. Moreover, the developed catalyst is superior in catalyzing the reactions involving sterically hindered substrate (1&#8208;naphthaldehyde) with high turnover numbers. A comparative catalytic study was conducted using different activation methods (chloroform and methanol exchanged activated samples), highlighting the significant effect of activation methods on its catalytic performances. The sustainable synthetic pathway under solvent&#8208;free conditions for a broad scope of substrates using low catalyst loading and excellent recyclability made the developed pH&#8208;stable framework a promising heterogeneous catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Lattice Doping Enables a Low&#8208;cost, High&#8208;capacity and Long&#8208;lasting Potassium Layered Oxide Cathode for Potassium and Sodium storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Layered transition metal oxides are highly promising host materials for K ions, owing to their high theoretical capacities and appropriate operational potentials. To address the intrinsic issues of KxMnO2 cathodes and optimize their electrochemical properties, a novel P3&#8208;type oxide doped with carefully chosen cost&#8208;effective, electrochemically active and multi&#8208;functional elements is proposed, namely K0.57Cu0.1Fe0.1Mn0.8O2. Compared to the pristine K0.56MnO2, its reversible specific is increased from 104 to 135 mAh g&#8208;1. In addition, the Cu and Fe co&#8208;doping triples the capacity under high current densities, and contributes to long&#8208;term stability over 500 cycles with a capacity retention of 68%. Such endeavor holds the potential to make potassium&#8208;ion batteries particularly competitive for application in sustainable, low&#8208;cost, and large&#8208;scale energy storage devices. In addition, the cathode is also extended for sodium storage. Facilitated by the interlayer K ions that protect the layered structure from collapsing and expand the diffusion pathway for sodium ions, the cathode shows a high reversible capacity of 144 mAh g&#8208;1, fast kinetics and a long lifespan over 1000 cycles. The findings offer a novel pathway for the development of high&#8208;performance and cost&#8208;effective sodium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Calix[4]arene&#8208;Based Porous Organic Cages and Their Gas Adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two crystalline large&#8208;sized porous organic cages (POCs) based on conical calix[4]arene (C4A) were designed and synthesized. The four&#8208;jaw C4A unit tends to follow the face&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly law with the planar triangular building blocks such as tris(4&#8208;aminophenyl)amine (TAPA) or 1,3,5&#8208;tris(4&#8208;aminophenyl)benzene (TAPB) to generate a predictable cage with a stoichiometry of [6+8]. The formation of the large cages is confirmed through their relative molecular mass measured using MALDI&#8208;TOF/TOF spectra. The protonated molecular ion peaks of C4A&#8208;TAPA and C4A&#8208;TAPB were observed at m/z 5109.0 (calculated for C336H240O24N32: m/z 5109.7) and m/z 5594.2 (calculated for C384H264O24N24: m/z 5598.4). C4A&#8208;POCs exhibit I&#8208;type N2 adsorption&#8208;desorption isotherms with the BET surface areas of 1444.9 m2&#215;g&#8208;1 and 1014.6 m2&#215;g&#8208;1. The CO2 uptakes at 273 K are 62.1 cm3&#215;g&#8208;1 and 52.4 cm3&#215;g&#8208;1 at a pressure of 100 KPa. The saturated iodine vapor static uptakes at 348 K are 3.9 g&#8729;g&#8208;1 and 3.5 g&#8729;g&#8208;1. The adsorption capacity of C4A&#8208;TAPA for SO2 reaches to 124.4 cm3&#215;g&#8208;1 at 298 K and 1.3 bar. Additionally, the adsorption capacities of C4A&#8208;TAPA for C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6 were evaluated.</dc:description>

         <title>The Application of Porous Organic Polymers as Metal Free Photocatalysts in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible light photocatalysis is an important tool in organic synthesis, enabling the clean and selective generation of reactive intermediates. Current precious metal&#8208;based photocatalysts face limitations like cost and toxicity, fueling the search for alternatives like porous organic polymers (POPs). This review examines POPs&#8217; role as photocatalysts in organic synthesis, discussing representative materials, mechanisms, comparisons with other photocatalysts, and future prospects.







Abstract
Concerns about increasing greenhouse gas emissions and their effect on our environment highlight the urgent need for new sustainable technologies. Visible light photocatalysis allows the clean and selective generation of reactive intermediates under mild conditions. The more widespread adoption of the current generation of photocatalysts, particularly those using precious metals, is hampered by drawbacks such as their cost, toxicity, difficult separation, and limited recyclability. This is driving the search for alternatives, such as porous organic polymers (POPs). This new class of materials is made entirely from organic building blocks, can possess high surface area and stability, and has a controllable composition and functionality. This review focuses on the application of POPs as photocatalysts in organic synthesis. For each reaction type, a representative material is discussed, with special attention to the mechanism of the reaction. Additionally, an overview is given, comparing POPs with other classes of photocatalysts, and critical conclusions and future perspectives are provided on this important field.

         <title>Polymer Supported Nitrogen&#8208;Bridged Symmetrical Binuclear Dioxidomolybdenum(VI) Complexes and Their Homogeneous Analogues as Potential Catalysts for Efficient Synthesis of 2&#8208;Amino&#8208;3&#8208;Cyano&#8208;4H&#8208;Chromenes/Pyrans</title>

         <dc:description>
Polymer supported heterogeneous as well as homogeneous nitrogen&#8208;bridged symmetrical binuclear dioxidomolybdenum(VI) complexes have been synthesised, characterised and used as potential catalysts for the multicomponent one pot synthesis of biologically important 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;cyano&#8208;4H&#8208;chromenes/pyrans.







Abstract
Reaction of 2&#8208;chloromethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzimidazole with known intermediates (i&#8211;iii), prepared from diaminoguanidine hydrochloride with salicylaldehyde, 5&#8208;bromosalicylaldehyde or 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsalicylaldehyde, in the presence of triethylamine (NEt3) led to the formation of benzimidazole appended new ligands, H4L1&#8208;H4L3 (I&#8211;III). The homogeneous nitrogen&#8208;bridged symmetrical binuclear complexes, [(MoVIO2)2(L1)(H2O)2] (1), [(MoVIO2)2(L2)(H2O)2] (2) and [(MoVIO2)2(L3)(MeOH)2] (3) have been isolated by reacting these ligands with [MoVIO2(acac)2] in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 molar ratio in refluxing methanol. Using 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 (ligand to Mo precursor) molar ratio under above reaction conditions resulted in the corresponding mononuclear complexes, [MoVIO2(H2L1)(MeOH)] (4), [MoVIO2(H2L2)(H2O)] (5) and [MoVIO2(H2L3)(MeOH)] (6). The binuclear heterogeneous compounds [(MoVIO2)2(L1)(DMF)2]@PS (PS&#8208;1), [(MoVIO2)2(L2)(DMF)2]@PS (PS&#8208;2) and [(MoVIO2)2(L3)(DMF)2]@PS (PS&#8208;3) have been obtained by immobilization of 1&#8211;3 onto chloromethylated polystyrene (PS) beads. All synthesized ligands, homogeneous as well as supported compounds have been characterized by elemental analyses and various spectroscopic methods. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction study of complexes 1 and 3 confirms their nitrogen&#8208;bridged symmetrical binuclear structures while 4 is mononuclear. Heterogeneous compounds (PS&#8208;1&#8208;PS&#8208;3) have further been studied by microwave plasma atomic emission spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and field emission scanning electron microscopy along with energy dispersive spectroscopy. These compounds (homogeneous and heterogeneous) were explored for catalytic applications to one&#8208;pot multicomponent reactions (MCRs) for efficient synthesis of biologically active 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;cyano&#8208;4H&#8208;chromenes/pyrans (21 examples). Optimising various reaction parameters helped in achieving as high as 97&#8201;% yields of products. Though, only half equivalent of the binuclear complexes (1&#8208;3) was required compared to mononuclear analogues (4&#8208;6) to achieve comparable yields, heterogeneous catalysts have an added advantage due to their stability and recyclability. Suitable reaction mechanism has also been proposed based on isolated intermediates.

         <title>Perfect Polar Alignment of Parallel Beloamphiphile Layers: Improved Structural Design Bias Realized in Ferroelectric Crystals of the Novel &#8220;Methoxyphenyl Series of Acetophenone Azines&#8221;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Azines are fundamentally different in that their helicity is a function of the N&#8722;N bond conformation and chirality results in the absence of chiral centers.&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at 10.1002/chem.202400182).







Abstract
Invited for the cover of this issue are Harmeet Bhoday, Nathan Knotts, and Rainer Glaser at the Missouri University of Science and Technology. Joe Miner, the university mascot, is a silent and honorary co&#8208;author and personifies the spirit of the old west and the determination to succeed (our emphasis). The image depicts one (MeO&#8208;Ph, Y)&#8208;azine molecule and a model of a perfectly polar stacked bilayer. The floodlight illumination presents a graphic metaphor of second&#8208;harmonic generation (frequency doubling) by the crystalline ferroelectric materials.

         <title>The Formation of Carbon Dots from D&#8208;Glucose Studied by Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon dots (C&#8208;dots) obtained from D&#8208;glucose have attracted great interest because of their properties and as a model for understanding the synthesis process and the origin of photoluminescence in carbon&#8208;based nanostructures. Synthesising C&#8208;dots under hydrothermal conditions has become one of the most common methods for their preparation. Understanding the details of this process is quite difficult. To tackle this challenge, we have adopted a multi&#8208;technique approach in our present work. We have correlated different spectroscopic analyses, such as infrared, Raman, fluorescence, NMR, and UV&#8208;Vis, to connect the emissions with specific chemical groups. In particular, in situ infrared analysis as a function of temperature has allowed following the formation of C=C, C=O, and COOH species and the rise of specific emissions. Only weak emissions due to n&#8208;&#960;* transitions are detected upon post&#8208;synthesis thermal annealing.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Excited&#8208;State Energy Transfer by Anchoring Dipole Orientation in Binary Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence/J&#8208;Aggregate Assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) has been widely applied in fluorescence imaging, sensing and so on, while developing useful strategy of boosting FRET efficiency becomes a key issue that limits the application. Except optimizing spectral properties, promoting orientation factor (&#954;2) has been well discussed but rarely utilized for boosting FRET. Herein, we constructed binary nano&#8208;assembling of two thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters (2CzPN and DMAC&#8208;DPS) with J&#8208;type aggregate of cyanine dye (C8S4) as doping films by taking advantage of their electrostatic interactions. Time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic measurements indicated that 2CzPN/Cy&#8208;J films exhibit an order of magnitude higher kFRET than DMAC&#8208;DPS/Cy&#8208;J films. Further quantitative analysing on kFRET and kDET indicated higher orientation factor (&#954;2) in 2CzPN/Cy&#8208;J films play a key role for achieving fast kFRET, which was subsequently confirmed by anisotropic measurements. Corresponding DFT/TDDFT calculation revealed strong &#8220;two&#8208;point&#8221; electrostatic anchoring in 2CzPN/Cy&#8208;J films that is responsible for highly orientated transitions. We provide a new strategy for boosting FRET in nano&#8208;assemblies, which might be inspired for designing FRET&#8208;based devices of sensing, imaging and information encryption.</dc:description>

         <title>Opportunities of MXenes in Heterogeneous Catalysis. V2C as Aerobic Oxidation Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>MXenes are 2D nanomaterials having alternating sheets of one atom&#8208;thick early transition metal layer and one atom&#8208;thick C or N layer. The external surface contains termination groups, whose nature depends on the etching agent used in the preparation procedure from the MAX phase. The present concept proposes that, due to their composition, the metal&#8208;surface termination groups make MXenes particularly suited as heterogeneous catalysts for some reactions. T After&#160;presenting&#160;the concept, we have selected V2C Mxene as&#160;example to illustrate its catalytic activity&#160; showing how the catalytic performance varies when the surface groups are modified. As test reaction we selected the aerobic oxidation of indane to the corresponding indanol/indanone mixture using molecular oxygen as terminal oxidizing reagent. Two previously reported procedures to modify the surface groups, namely surface dehydroxylation by thermal treatment under diluted hydrogen flow and surface oxidation with ammonium monoperoxy sulfate to convert some surface groups into oxo groups were used, observing in both cases a decrease in the catalytic activity of V2C. Based on this, VIII/IV&#8208;OH are proposed as catalytic centers in this aerobic oxidation. Overall, the present concept shows the merits of MXenes in heterogeneous catalysis, based on their chemical composition and the surface functionality.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Emission Properties of 2,1,3&#8208;Benzothiadiazoles via Regioselective Substitution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole (BTD) unit is a prominent building block commonly used in various research areas such as optoelectronics and bioimaging. Despite its great versatility, the development of strategies to elaborate BTD has been largely neglected, including exploring its reactivity and understanding how regioselective functionalization can be used to tune the fluorescence emission. Previous focus has primarily been on C4&#8208; or C4,C7&#8208;substitutions. &#160;Here, a series of unsymmetrical mono &#8211; and disubstituted BTDs was synthesized and characterized for their photophysical properties. &#160;The reaction scope includes all six possible substituent patterns on the BTD benzoid ring (C4&#8208;, C5&#8208;, C4,C5&#8208;, C4,C6&#8208;, C4,C7&#8208; and C5,C6&#8208;substitution), which comprise arrangements that previously been synthetically challenging to access. By introducing a methoxy and/or a phenyl group we demonstrate that the emissive behavior of BTD derivatives strongly depends on the position of the substituent(s). &#160;We show that regioselective substitution on BTD can engender long&#8208;lived fluorescence and circumvent strong fluorescence quenching in polar protic solvents, which is a limitation of many previously described BTD derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Generation and Identification of the Trifluorosilylarsinidene F3SiAs and Isomeric Perfluorinated Arsasilene FAsSiF2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The trifluorosilylarsinidene F3SiAs in the triplet ground state has been generated through the reaction of laser&#8208;ablated silicon atoms with AsF3 in cryogenic Ne&#8208; and Ar&#8208;matrices. The reactions proceed with the initial formation perfluorinated arsasilene FAsSiF2 in the singlet ground state by two As&#8210;F bonds insertion reaction on annealing. The trifluorosilylarsinidene F3SiAs was formed via F&#8208;migration reactions of FAsSiF2 under irradiation at UV light (&#955; = 275 nm). The characterization of FAsSiF2 and F3SiAs by IR matrix&#8208;isolation spectroscopy is supported by computations at CCSD(T)&#8208;F12/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ and B3LYP/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ levels of theory.</dc:description>

         <title>Radiation&#8208;Induced Defects in Uranyl Trinitrate Solids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Actinides are inherently radioactive; thus, ionizing radiation is emitted by these elements can have profound effects on its surrounding chemical environment through the formation of free radical species. While previous work has noted that the presence of free radicals in the system impacts the redox state of the actinides, there is little atomistic understanding of how these metal cations interact with free radicals. Herein, we explore the effects of radiation (UV and &#947;) on three U(VI) trinitrate complexes, M[UO2(NO3)3] (where M = K+, Rb+, Cs+), and their respective nitrate salts in the solid state via electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and Raman spectroscopy paired with Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods. We find that the alkali salts form nitrate radicals under UV and &#947; irradiation, but also note the presence of additional degradation products.&#160; M[UO2(NO3)3] solids also form nitrate radicals and additional DFT calculations indicate the species corresponds to a change from the bidentate bound nitrate anion into a monodentate NO3&#8226; radical.&#160; Computational studies also highlight the need to include the second sphere coordination environment around the [UO2(NO3)3]0,1 species to gain agreement between the experimental and predicted EPR signatures.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigation of Isolated IrF5&#8722;, IrF6&#8722; Anions and M[IrF6] (M = Na, K, Rb, Cs) Ion Pairs by Matrix&#8208;Isolation Spectroscopy and Relativistic Quantum&#8208;Chemical Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The molecular IrF5&#8722;, IrF6&#8722; anions and M[IrF6] (M = Na&#8208;Cs) ion pairs were prepared by co&#8208;deposition of laser&#8208;ablated MF with IrF6 and isolated in solid Ne or Ar matrices. The free anions were obtained by co&#8208;deposition of IrF6 with laser&#8208;ablated metals (Ir, Pt) as electron sources. The products were characterized in a combined analysis of matrix IR spectroscopy and electronic structure calculations using two&#8208;component quasi&#8208;relativistic DFT methods accounting for scalar&#8208;relativistic and spin&#8208;orbit coupling effects as well as multi&#8208;reference configuration&#8208;interaction approaches with SOC. Inclusion of SOC is crucial in the prediction of spectra and properties of IrF6&#8722; and its alkali&#8208;metal ion pairs. The observed IR bands and the computations show that the IrF6&#8722; anion adopts an Oh structure in a nondegenerate ground state stabilized by SOC effects, and not a distorted D4h structure in a triplet ground state as suggested by scalar&#8208;relativistic calculations. The corresponding &#8220;closed&#8208;shell&#8221; M[IrF6] ion pairs with C3v symmetry are stabilized by coordination of an alkali metal ion to three F atoms, and their structural change in the series from M = Na to Cs was proven spectroscopically. There is no evidence for the formation of IrF7, IrF7&#8722; or M[IrF7] (M = Na&#8208;Cs) ion pairs in our experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>Reductions of Arenes using a Magnesium&#8208;Dinitrogen Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this contribution, we present &#8220;Birch&#8208;type&#8221;, and other reductions of simple arenes by the potassium salt of an anionic magnesium dinitrogen complex, [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;N2)] (TCHPNON = 4,5&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;tricyclohexylanilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;diethyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;xanthene), which acts as a masked dimagnesium(I) diradical in these reactions. This reagent is non&#8208;hazardous, easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle, and readily provides access to 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene reduction products under relatively mild reaction conditions. This system works effectively to reduce benzene, naphthalene and anthracene through magnesium&#8208;bound &#8220;Birch&#8208;type&#8221; reduction intermediates. Cyclohexadiene products can be subsequently released from the magnesium centres by protonolysis with methanol. In contrast, the reduction of substituted arenes is less selective and involves competing reaction pathways. For toluene and 1,3,5&#8208;triphenylbenzene, the structural authentication of &#8220;Birch&#8208;type&#8221; reduction intermediates is conclusive, although the formation of corresponding 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene derivatives was low yielding. Reduction of anisole did not yield an isolable &#8220;Birch&#8208;type&#8221; intermediate, but instead gave a C&#8211;O activation product. Treating triphenylphosphine with [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;N2)] resulted in the extrusion of both biphenyl and dinitrogen to afford a magnesium(II) phosphanide [{K(TCHPNON)Mg(&#956;&#8208;PPh2)}2]. Reduction of fluorobenzene proceeded via C&#8210;F activation of the arene, and isolation of the magnesium(II) fluoride [{K(TCHPNON)Mg(&#956;&#8208;F)}2]. Finally, the two&#8208;electron reduction of 1,3,5,7&#8208;cyclooctatetraene (COT) with [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;N2)] yielded a complex, [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;COT)], incorporating the aromatic dianion (COT2&#8211;).</dc:description>

         <title>Multiple Bonding in AeN&#8208; (Ae = Ca, Sr, Ba)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quantum chemical calculations using ab initio methods at the MRCI+Q(8,9)/def2&#8208;QZVPPD and CCSD(T)/def2&#8208;QZVPPD levels as well as density functional theory are reported for the diatomic molecules AeN&#8208; (Ae = Ca, Sr, Ba). The nature of the bonds is analyzed with a variety of methods. The anions CaN&#8208; and SrN&#8208; have electronic triplet (3&#928;) ground states with nearly identical bond dissociation energies De ~57 kcal/mol calculated at the MRCI+Q(8,9)/def2&#8208;QZVPPD level of theory. In contrast, the heavier homologue BaN&#8208; has a singlet (1&#931;+) ground state, which is only 1.1 kcal/mol below the triplet (3&#931;&#8208;) state. The computed bond dissociation energy of (1&#931;+) BaN&#8208; is 68.4 kcal/mol. The calculations at the CCSD(T)&#8208;full/def2&#8208;QZVPPD and BP86&#8208;D3(BJ)/def2&#8208;QZVPPD levels of theory are in reasonable agreement with the MRCI+Q(8,9)/def2&#8208;QZVPPD data except for the singlet (1&#931;+) state, which has a large multireference character. The calculated atomic partial charges given by the CM5, Voronoi and Hirshfeld methods suggest small to medium&#8208;sized charge donation toward Ae atom Ae&#8592;N&#8208; for most electronic states. In contrast, the NBO method predicts for all species medium to large electronic charge donation toward nitrogen Ae&#8594;N&#8208;, which is due to the neglect of the (n)p AOs of Ae atoms as genuine valence orbitals.</dc:description>

         <title>In Silico Design and Characterization of a New Molecular Electride: Li@Calix[3]Pyrrole</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrides, in which anionic electrons are localized independent&#160;of the atoms in the compound, have shown promise especially as catalysts and optoelectronic materials. Here, we present a new computationally designed molecular electride, Li@calix[3]pyrrole (Li@C3P). Electron density and electron localization function analyses unequivocally confirm the existence of localized electride electron density,&#160;independent of any specific atoms. Non&#8208;covalent interaction plots further validate the character of the isolated localized electron, suggesting that the system can be accurately represented by Li+@calix[3]pyrrole&#8901;e&#8208;, denoting its distinct charge separation. The remarkable non&#8208;linear optical properties of Li@C3P, including average polarizability&#160;= 412.4 au, first hyperpolarizability&#160;= 4.46 &#215; 104 au, and second hyperpolarizability&#160;= 18.40 &#215; 106 au, are unparalleled in the previously reported and similar Li@C4P molecular electride. Furthermore, energy decomposition analysis&#160;in combination with natural orbital for chemical valence&#160;theory sheds light on the mechanism of electron density transfer from Li to the C3P cage, yielding the charge&#8208;separated Li@C3P complex.&#160;In addition to the electron transfer, a key factor to its electride nature is the electronic structure of the CnP cage, which has its lowest unoccupied molecular orbital&#160;located in the void adjacent to the N&#8211;H groups at the back of the bowl&#8208;shaped CnP cage.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective Synthesis of Hamilton&#8208;Receptor&#8208;Fullerene Oligo&#8208;Adducts for the Supramolecular Binding of Cyanuric Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new concept for the regioselective synthesis of Hamilton&#8208;receptor and cyanurate&#8208;functionalized oligo adducts of the fullerene C60 was developed. Based on an in&#8208;situ deprotection and click&#8208;post&#8208;functionalization approach with novel azido precursors, the corresponding fullerene hexakis&#8208;adducts with octahedral addition patterns and up to twelve Hamilton&#8208;receptor/cyanurate moieties surrounding the fullerene sphere were synthesized. The versatility of this approach was further demonstrated by the synthesis of Hamilton&#8208;receptor/cyanurate functionalized fullerene mono&#8208;adducts, which are not accessible by direct cyclopropanation. Several fullerene target compounds were purified by simple washing procedures of the solid crude reaction mixture without the need for chromatography. The resulting fullerene mono&#8208; and hexakis&#8208;adducts were fully characterized and their supramolecular properties were investigated by NMR&#8208;spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC).</dc:description>

This review explores the utilization of activatable NIR&#8208;II photodiagnosis and phototherapy based on tumor microenvironments (e.g., reactive oxygen species, pH, glutathione, hypoxia) and external stimuli (e.g., laser, ultrasound, photothermal) for precise tumor treatment and imaging. Special emphasis is placed on the advancements and advantages of activatable NIR&#8208;II nanomedicines in novel therapeutic modalities like photodynamic therapy, photothermal therapy, and photoacoustic imaging. This encompasses achieving deep tumor penetration, real&#8208;time monitoring of the treatment process, and obtaining high&#8208;resolution, high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio images even at low material concentrations. Lastly, from a clinical perspective, the challenges faced by activatable NIR&#8208;II phototherapy are discussed, alongside potential strategies to overcome these hurdles.</dc:description>

         <title>Room Temperature Phosphorescence in Crystalline Iodinated Eumelanin Monomer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functionalization of eumelanin monomer by halogenation leading to triplet state population via intersystem crossing (ISC), along with the observance of room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in the crystalline iodinated eumelanin monomer.







Abstract
We report the room temperature phosphorescence upon iodination on a crystalline eumelanin monomer with shielded hydroxyl moieties, ethyl 5,6&#8208;dimethoxyindole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylate (DMICE). Ultrafast intersystem crossing (ISC) is observed in the iodinated (IDMICE) as well as brominated (BDMICE) analogues of the eumelanin monomer derivative in solution. The triplet quantum yields (&#966;T) and intersystem crossing rates (kISC) of the halogenated eumelanin derivatives are 
=25.4&#177;1.1&#8201;%; 
=1.95&#215;109&#8197;s&#8722;1 and 
=59.1&#177;1.6&#8201;%; 
1.36&#215;1010&#8197;s&#8722;1, as monitored using transient absorption spectroscopy. Theoretical calculations based on nuclear ensemble method reveal that computed kISC and spin&#8208;orbit coupling matrix elements for eumelanin derivatives are larger for IDMICE relative to BDMICE. The halogen and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, with distinct excitonic coupling and higher ISC rate promote phosphorescence in IDMICE molecular crystals. Accessing triplet excited states and resultant photoluminescence through structural modification of eumelanin scaffolds paves way for exploring the versatility of eumelanin&#8208;inspired molecules as bio&#8208;functional materials.

         <title>Achieving Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Metal Anodes via Molecule Anchoring and lon&#8208;Transport pumping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Valine was introduced as an aqueous electrolyte additive. The functional groups within the additive molecules were utilized to stabilize the electrode/electrolyte interface (EEI), thereby achieving a reversible dendrite&#8208;free zinc anode.







Abstract
The potential for scale&#8208;up application has been acknowledged by researchers for rechargeable aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). Nonetheless, the progress of the development is significantly impeded due to the instability of the interface between the zinc anode and electrolyte. Herein, efficient and environmentally benign valine (Val) were introduced as aqueous electrolyte additive to stabilize the electrode/electrolyte interface (EEI) via functional groups in additive molecules, thus achieving reversible dendrite&#8208;free zinc anode. The amino groups present in Val molecules have a strong ability to adsorb on the surface of zinc metal, enabling the construction of anchored molecular layer on the surface of zinc anodes. The strongly polar carboxyl groups in Val molecules can act as ion&#8208;transport pumps to capture zinc ions in the electric double layer (EDL) through coordination chemistry. Therefore, this reconstructed EEI could modulate the zinc ion flux and simultaneously suppress side reactions and dendritic growth of Zn. Consequently, a long stable cycling up to 1400&#8197;h at a high current density of 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 is achieved. Additionally, Zn//V2O5 full cell with Val additive exhibit enhanced cyclability, retaining 77&#8201;% capacity after 3000&#8197;cycles, displaying significant potential in promoting the commercialization of ZIBs.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Induced Structural, Optical and Magnetic Modifications in Lanthanide Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sensibility of lanthanide coordination complexes to the crystal field strength makes them ideal candidates for switching Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet behavior and piezochromic effect under applied high pressure. A complementary structure&#8208;property relationship is established with the combination of high pressure magnetometry and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction allowing to explain the observed structural, optical and magnetic modifications.







Abstract
Lanthanide Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets are fascinating objects that break magnetic performance records with observable magnetic bistability at the boiling temperature of liquid nitrogen, paving the way for potential applications in high&#8208;density data storage. The switching of lanthanide SMM has been successfully achieved using several external stimuli such as redox reaction, pH titration, light irradiation or solvation/desolvation thanks to the high sensitivity of the magnetic anisotropy to any structural change in the lanthanide surrounding. Nevertheless, the use of applied high pressure as an external stimulus is largely underused, especially considering that it can be combined with high pressure X&#8208;ray diffraction to establish a complementary structure&#8208;property relationship. This Concept article summarizes the few relevant examples of investigations of lanthanide SMMs under applied high pressure, provides conclusions on the effect of such stimulus on molecular structures and magnetic anisotropy, and finally draws perspective on the future development of magnetic measurements under applied pressure.

         <title>Predisposition in Dynamic Covalent Chemistry: The Role of Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions in the Assembly of Tetrahedral Boronate Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Latent intramolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions (NCIs) within the building blocks play a crucial role in the assembly of molecular organic cages (MOCs) via Dynamic Covalent Chemistry (DCC). These intramolecular interactions emerge from induced conformational restrictions during cage assembly, ultimately dictating the reaction outcome in a relay&#8208;like fashion.







Abstract
Directional bonding strategies guide the design of complex molecular architectures, yet challenges arise due to emergent behavior. Rigid structures face geometric constraints and sensitivity to mismatches, hindering the efficient assembly of molecular organic cages (MOCs). Harnessing intramolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions offers a promising solution, broadening geometrical possibilities and enhancing adaptability to boost assembly yields. However, identifying these interactions remains challenging, with their full potential sometimes latent until final assembly. This study explores these challenges by synthesizing boronic acid tripods with varied oxygen positions at the tripodal feet and investigating their role in assembling tetrahedral boronate MOCs. Our results reveal substantial differences in the assembly efficiency among tripods. While the building blocks with oxygen in the benzylic position relative to the central aromatic ring form the MOCs in high yields, those with the oxygen atom directly bound to the central aromatic ring, only yield traces. Through X&#8208;ray crystallography and DFT analyses, we elucidate how intramolecular interactions profoundly influence the geometry of the building blocks and cages in a relay&#8208;like fashion, highlighting the importance of considering intramolecular interactions in the rational design of (supra)molecular architectures.

&lt;p&gt;Latent intramolecular non-covalent interactions (NCIs) within the building blocks play a crucial role in the assembly of molecular organic cages (MOCs) via Dynamic Covalent Chemistry (DCC). These intramolecular interactions emerge from induced conformational restrictions during cage assembly, ultimately dictating the reaction outcome in a relay-like fashion.

         <title>Tandem Electrochemical Oxidation of Polycyclic Aromatic Amines Towards Carbazoles and Phenazine&#8208;based Aza&#8208;helicenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experimental and theoretical study revealed that high activity of N&#8722;C(&#945;)&#8722;C(&#946;1) region of the free radical hybrid determine the regioselectivity of polycyclic aromatic amines (PAAs) electrochemical oxidation towards carbazole and phenazine based aza&#8208;helicenes. This work would pave the way for precise construction of heteroatom fused helical large &#960;&#8208;conjugated system using direct splicing strategy from PAHs derivatives.







Abstract
Experimental and theoretical study of the regioselectivity and mechanism of polycyclic aromatic amine (PAA) electrochemical oxidation is important for designing nitrogen doped large &#960;&#8208;conjugated functional molecules. Herein, we used binary&#8208;, ternary&#8208;, and quaternary&#8208;fused PAAs as electro&#8208;oxidative reaction substrates to investigate the yield changes of carbazole and phenazine based aza&#8208;helicene other than oligomers, which were obtained through pyrrole and pyrazine annulation pathways. Combined with the restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) and steric hindrance factor analysis of the substrate, the electron spin density distribution of free radical resonance hybrid and the spin population analysis of the atoms in the structure of each free radical tautomer indicate that the degree of delocalized dispersion of N free radical and the resulting change in the spin density distribution of C free radical tautomers determine the reaction regioselectivity. The potential charge of the K&#8208;region, Bay&#8208;region, and L&#8208;region adjacent to the C(&#945;)&#8722;C(&#946;1) bond is higher than that of other regions within the molecule, and the charge in these high RESP regions tends to delocalize more strongly toward electron&#8208;deficient N free radicals. Thus, the activity of N&#8722;C(&#945;)&#8722;C(&#946;1) region is increased, which supports the proposed free radical addition and free radical coupling mechanism for the electro&#8208;oxidative reaction of PAA.

         <title>Driving Triplet State Population in Benzothioxanthene Imide Dyes: Let's twist!</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A subtle chemical modification in the bay area of the benzothioxanthene imide (BTI) was used to shed light on the closely intertwined connections between spin&#8208;orbit coupling, distortion of the &#960;&#8208;system, and intersystem crossing.







Abstract
Controlling the formation of photoexcited triplet states is critical for many (photo)chemical and physical applications. Here, we demonstrate that a permanent out&#8208;of&#8208;plane distortion of the benzothioxanthene imide (BTI) dye promotes intersystem crossing by increasing spin&#8208;orbit coupling. This manipulation was achieved through a subtle chemical modification, specifically the bay&#8208;area methylation. Consequently, this simple yet efficient approach expands the catalog of known molecular engineering strategies for synthesizing heavy atom&#8208;free, dual redox&#8208;active, yet still emissive and synthetically accessible photosensitizers.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preparation methods and electrochemical applications of MOFs and their derivatives composite materials in the field of supercapacitors are reviewed. In addition, the challenges and prospects of MOFs in supercapacitor are discussed.







Abstract
Up to now, the mainstream adoption of renewable energy has brought about substantial transformations in the electricity and energy sector. This shift has garnered considerable attention within the scientific community. Supercapacitors, known for their exceptional performance metrics like good charge/discharge capability, strong power density, as well as extended cycle longevity, have gained widespread traction across various sectors, including transportation and aviation. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with unique traits including adaptable structure, highly customizable synthetic methods, and high specific surface area, have emerged as strong candidates for electrode materials. For enhancing the performance, MOFs are commonly compounded with other conducting materials to increase capacitance. This paper provides a detailed analysis of various common preparation strategies and characteristics of MOFs. It summarizes the recent application of MOFs and their derivatives as supercapacitor electrodes alongside other carbon materials, metal compounds, and conductive polymers. Additionally, the challenges encountered by MOFs in the realm of supercapacitor applications are thoroughly discussed. Compared to previous reviews, the content of this paper is more comprehensive, offering readers a deeper understanding of the diverse applications of MOFs. Furthermore, it provides valuable suggestions and guidance for future progress and development in the field of MOFs.

         <title>Enhancing Intramolecular Ferromagnetic Coupling in Tetrathiafulvalene&#8211;Nitronyl Nitroxide&#8208;Based Compounds through Spin Polarization Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular ferromagnetic (FM) J&#8208;coupling between spin&#8208;polarized&#8208;donor radicals like Tetrathiafulvalene (TTF+&#8901;) and Nitronyl&#8208;Nitroxide (NN) connected by a coupler, such as in BTBN, is a key ingredient to achieve magnetoresistant response. In silico modifications of BTBN accomplish the enhancement of the FM coupling by using hydroxyl&#8208;ethylene as coupler, while preserving BTBN&#8242;s structure, providing promising candidates for a (possibly) improved magnetoresistance material.







Abstract
Spin&#8208;polarized donor radicals based on tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) derivatives and nitronyl nitroxide (NN) radicals in which one&#8208;electron oxidation involves the HOMO instead of the SOMO are well known for exhibiting magnetoresistance. In particular, BTBN consists of one dibromo&#8208;TTF and one NN radical, which are linked by a phenyl coupler group. One of the key factors driving magnetoresistance is the presence of intramolecular ferromagnetic (FM) coupling between the oxidized &#960;&#8208;donor (TTF+&#8901;, D unit) and NN (R unit). Here, a theoretical study is carried out to assess suitable candidates with enhanced FM coupling with respect BTBN, which is thus used as a reference. The study is conducted via in silico chemical modification of the substituents of the BTBN basic functional units (D and R radicals, C coupler) to benefit from the spin polarization mechanism to boost the intramolecular FM coupling, aiming to distort the BTBN radical arrangement within the molecular crystal as little as possible, in the event the material can be synthesized. NICSiso(1) and Wiberg's Bond Order are analyzed to further assist in identifying promising potential candidates, since the decrease in aromaticity is expected to enhance the diradical character and give rise to a larger magnetic coupling value. The most favorable diradical building block to replace the BTBN moiety results from using a hydroxyl&#8208;ethylene (&#8722;(H)C=C(OH)&#8722;) as a coupler preserving BTBN original radicals, namely, NN and TTF+&#8901; units.

     alt="Enhancing Intramolecular Ferromagnetic Coupling in Tetrathiafulvalene&#8211;Nitronyl Nitroxide-Based Compounds through Spin Polarization Mechanism"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intramolecular ferromagnetic (FM) J-coupling between spin-polarized-donor radicals like Tetrathiafulvalene (TTF&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8901;) and Nitronyl-Nitroxide (NN) connected by a coupler, such as in BTBN, is a key ingredient to achieve magnetoresistant response. &lt;i&gt;In silico&lt;/i&gt; modifications of BTBN accomplish the enhancement of the FM coupling by using hydroxyl-ethylene as coupler, while preserving BTBN&#8242;s structure, providing promising candidates for a (possibly) improved magnetoresistance material.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spin-polarized donor radicals based on tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) derivatives and nitronyl nitroxide (NN) radicals in which one-electron oxidation involves the HOMO instead of the SOMO are well known for exhibiting magnetoresistance. In particular, BTBN consists of one dibromo-TTF and one NN radical, which are linked by a phenyl coupler group. One of the key factors driving magnetoresistance is the presence of intramolecular ferromagnetic (FM) coupling between the oxidized &#960;-donor (TTF&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8901;, D unit) and NN (R unit). Here, a theoretical study is carried out to assess suitable candidates with enhanced FM coupling with respect BTBN, which is thus used as a reference. The study is conducted via &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; chemical modification of the substituents of the BTBN basic functional units (D and R radicals, C coupler) to benefit from the spin polarization mechanism to boost the intramolecular FM coupling, aiming to distort the BTBN radical arrangement within the molecular crystal as little as possible, in the event the material can be synthesized. NICS&lt;sub&gt;iso&lt;/sub&gt;(1) and Wiberg's Bond Order are analyzed to further assist in identifying promising potential candidates, since the decrease in aromaticity is expected to enhance the diradical character and give rise to a larger magnetic coupling value. The most favorable diradical building block to replace the BTBN moiety results from using a hydroxyl-ethylene (&#8722;(H)C=C(OH)&#8722;) as a coupler preserving BTBN original radicals, namely, NN and TTF&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8901; units. This study aims at illustrating the feasibility of improving the intramolecular FM interaction between radical moieties, which is fully realized, as a first step towards the synthesis of new materials with (possibly) enhanced magnetoresistance properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boosting Electrocatalytic N2 Reduction to NH3 by Enhancing N2 Activation via Interaction between Au Nanoparticles and MIL&#8208;101(Fe) in Neutral Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MIL&#8208;101(Fe) with a large specific surface area has a strong N2 adsorption capacity, which promotes the enrichment of N2 on the surface of the catalyst, and the interaction between Au NPs and MIL&#8208;101(Fe) enhances the activation of N2, thereby effectively promoting the electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) has attracted much attention as a sustainable ammonia production technology, but it needs further exploration due to its slow kinetics and the existence of competitive side reactions. In this research, xAu/MIL&#8208;101(Fe) catalysts were obtained by loading gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) onto MIL&#8208;101(Fe) using a one&#8208;step reduction strategy. Herein, MIL&#8208;101(Fe), with high specific surface area and strong N2 adsorption capacity, is used as a support to disperse Au NPs to increase the electrochemical active surface area. Au NPs, with a high NRR activity, is introduced as the active site to promote charge transfer and intermediate formation rates. More importantly, the strong interaction between Au NPs and MIL&#8208;101(Fe) enhances the electron transfer between Au NPs and MIL&#8208;101(Fe), thereby enhancing the activation of N2 and achieving efficient NRR. Among the prepared catalysts, 15&#8201;%Au/MIL&#8208;101(Fe) has the highest NH3 yield of 46.37&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1cat and a Faraday efficiency of 39.38&#8201;% at &#8722;0.4&#8197;V (vs. RHE). In&#8208;situ FTIR reveals that the NRR mechanism of 15&#8201;%Au/MIL&#8208;101(Fe) follows the binding alternating pathway and also indicates that the interaction between Au NPs and MIL&#8208;101(Fe) strengthens the activation of the N&#8801;N bond in the rate&#8208;limiting process, thereby accelerating the NRR process.

         <title>Fingerprints of Chalcogen Bonding Revealed Through 77Se&#8208;NMR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oriented chemical shift tensor can reveal anisotropy in the electron density around a reporter nucleus. Here we measure the 77Se chemical shift tensor in a single crystal, which shows significant anisotropy due to participation of the selenium in a chalcogen bond. This technique suggests the presence of a potential second chalcogen bond site, which has not previously been observed in this system.







Abstract
77Se&#8208;NMR is used to characterise several chalcogen bonded complexes of derivatives of the organoselenium drug ebselen, exploring a range of electron demand. NMR titration experiments support the intuitive understanding that chalcogen bond donors bearing more electron withdrawing substituents give rise stronger chalcogen bonds. The chemical shift of the selenium nucleus is also shown to move upfield as it participates in a chalcogen bond. Solid&#8208;state NMR is used to explore chalcogen bonding in co&#8208;crystals. Due to the lack of molecular reorientation on the NMR timescale in the solid state, the shape of the chemical shift tensor can be determined using this technique. A range of co&#8208;crystals are shown to have extremely large chemical shift anisotropy, which suggests a strongly anisotropic electron density distribution around the selenium atom. A single crystal NMR experiment was conducted using one of the co&#8208;crystals, affording the absolute orientation of the chemical shift tensor within the crystal. This showed that the selenium nucleus is strongly shielded in the direction of the chalcogen bond (due to the approach of the lone pair of the Lewis base), and strongly deshielded in the perpendicular direction. The orientation of the deshielded axis is consistent with the presence of a second &#963;&#8208;hole which is not participating in a chalcogen bond, showing the profound effect of electron density anisotropy on the chemical shift.

         <title>Chiral Spiro&#8208;Tetrathiafulvalenes: Synthesis, Chiroptical Properties, Conformational Issues and Charge Transfer Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spiro&#8208;TTFs have been characterized experimentally and theoretically, and the formation of charge transfer complexes with TCNQF2 and TCNQF4 has been reported. The chiroptical investigation of the neutral systems revealed significant differences in chiroptical activity depending on the nature of chiral centres and between diastereomers.







Abstract
Within this work we have investigated spiro&#8208;based tetrathiafulvalenes (TTFs) obtained as mixtures of stereoisomers from racemic spiro[5.5]undeca&#8208;1,8&#8208;dien&#8208;3&#8208;one. Compared to previously described spiro&#8208;TTFs, enantiomeric and diastereoisomeric forms have been here separated by chiral HPLC and fully characterized both experimentally and theoretically. The two types of spiro&#8208;based chiral derivatives contain either one (2) or three (1) chiral centres out of each one is spiro&#8208;type. Experimental CD, supported by TD&#8208;DFT calculations, shows differences in the optical activity between the 1 and 2 and their intermediates. The low optical activity of 2 and 3 (spiro alone chirality) was attributed to the presence of two conformers in the solution (ax and eq) of opposite Cotton effect whereas in the case of 1 and 5 (spiro and stereogenic centres) the spiro chirality seems to be responsible of the Cotton effect in the high energy region whereas the R and S chirality in the low energy region. Racemic and enantiopure forms have been successfully used for the synthesis of charge transfer complexes with tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) based acceptors.

         <title>Quest for Double M&#246;bius Aromaticity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum chemical calculation predict double and single M&#246;bius aromaticity in the global minimum geometries of Rh2B2 and RhB2&#8722; clusters. Heavier analogue Ir2B2 follows the same type of aromaticity, albeit being non&#8208;planar. Aromaticity of these clusters have been confirmed by various analysis.







Abstract
Neutral four&#8208;membered rings with 4n&#8197;electrons are generally H&#252;ckel antiaromatic. On the other hand, 4n electron system can also be M&#246;bius aromatic, although identification has escaped so far. A recent study of double M&#246;bius aromaticity has been put forwarded in the D2h symmetric singlet ground state of four member Pa2B2 ring. Although interesting, but the synthesis possesses a significant challenge as Pa is rare, highly radioactive and toxic. Herein, a synthetically viable four membered Rh2B2 cluster is proposed which contains double M&#246;bius aromaticity. Interestingly, the three membered RhB2&#8722; cluster also possess M&#246;bius aromaticity and is the smallest ring to show such phenomenon.

         <title>Scaffold&#8208;Oriented Asymmetric Catalysis: Conformational Modulation of Transition State Multivalency during a Catalyst&#8208;Controlled Assembly of a Pharmaceutically Relevant Atropisomer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Albeit of significative recent pharmaceutical interest, there is an almost complete absence of asymmetric methods to deliver enantioenriched, axially chiral N&#8208;aryl quinazolinediones. Posed with the challenge of establishing such a catalytic method, we developed a new class of superbasic bifunctional peptidyl guanidine catalysts. In addition, we carried out extensive computational modeling to dissect the role of the individual elements in governing the catalyst's activity and selectivity.







Abstract
A new class of superbasic, bifunctional peptidyl guanidine catalysts is presented, which enables the organocatalytic, atroposelective synthesis of axially chiral quinazolinediones. Computational modeling unveiled the conformational modulation of the catalyst by a novel phenyl urea N&#8208;cap, that preorganizes the structure into the active, folded state. A previously unanticipated noncovalent interaction involving a difluoroacetamide acting as a hybrid mono&#8208; or bidentate hydrogen bond donor emerged as a decisive control element inducing atroposelectivity. These discoveries spurred from a scaffold&#8208;oriented project inspired from a fascinating investigational BTK inhibitor featuring two stable chiral axes and relies on a mechanistic framework that was foreign to the extant lexicon of asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>Substitution Lability of the Perfluorinated Cp* Ligand in [Rh(COD)(C5(CF3)5)] Towards Triphenylpnictogens EPh3 (E=N, P, As, Sb, Bi)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper we present the structural diversity of products formed upon substitution of the labile perfluorinated Cp* ligand [C5(CF3)5]&#8722; in [Rh(COD)(C5(CF3)5)] (COD=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene) by triphenylpnictogens EPh3 (E=N, P, As, Sb, Bi).







Abstract
Triphenylpnictogens EPh3 (E=N, P, As, Sb, Bi) are able to displace the perfluorinated Cp* ligand in [Rh(COD)(C5(CF3)5)] (COD=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene) in up to quantitative yield. The resulting ionic products contain [C5(CF3)5]&#8722; as uncoordinated counter anion. The cations feature [Rh(COD)]+ fragments, coordinated by one (N, Bi), two (P, As) or three (Sb) triphenylpnictogen moieties. Whereas coordination via the pnictogen is observed for P, As and Sb, &#960;&#8208;coordination of the aryl rings is observed for N and Bi.

         <title>Recent Advancements in Continuous&#8208;Flow Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Coupling Utilizing Immobilized Molecular Palladium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present &#8216;Concept&#8217; provides a comprehensive review of recent strides in continuous&#8208;flow Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling, employing a packed&#8208;bed reactor featuring immobilized palladium complexes. Emphasis is placed on meticulously designed catalyst structures and the innovative reaction technologies employed under continuous&#8208;flow conditions, accentuating their pivotal roles in the establishment of a pragmatic synthesis process.







Abstract
Immobilized Pd&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling under continuous&#8208;flow conditions using a packed&#8208;bed reactor, representing an efficient, automated, practical, and safe technology compared to conventional batch&#8208;type reactions. The core objective of this study is the development of an active and durable catalyst. In contrast to supported Pd nanoparticles, the attachment of Pd complexes onto solid supports through well&#8208;defined coordination sites is considered a favorable approach for preparing highly dispersed and stabilized Pd species. These species can be directly employed in various flow reactions without the need for pre&#8208;treatment. This concept paper explores recent achievements involving the application of immobilized Pd complexes as precatalysts for continuous&#8208;flow Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling. Our focus is to elucidate the significance of the designed catalyst structures in relation to their catalytic performance under flow conditions. Additionally, we highlight various reaction systems and catalyst packing methods, emphasizing their crucial roles in establishing a practical synthesis process.

         <title>Morphological Transformations of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Nucleocapsid Protein Biocondensates Mediated by Antimicrobial Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 nucleocapsid protein (N&#8722;P) undergoes liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation in the presence of RNA, resulting in biocondensate formation. Antimicrobial peptides are found to interfere with N&#8722;P/RNA condensates, leading to clustering or even to the formation of fibrillar structures. Such morphological transformations are expected to impair the normal functionality of the N&#8722;P droplets and thus virion assembly.







Abstract
Recently, the discovery of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) as excellent candidates for overcoming antibiotic resistance has attracted significant attention. AMPs are short peptides active against bacteria, cancer cells, and viruses. It has been shown that the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 nucleocapsid protein (N&#8722;P) undergoes liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation in the presence of RNA, resulting in biocondensate formation. These biocondensates are crucial for viral replication as they concentrate the viral RNA with the host cell&#8216;s protein machinery required for viral protein expression. Thus, N&#8722;P biocondensates are promising targets to block or slow down viral RNA transcription and consequently virion assembly. We investigated the ability of three AMPs to interfere with N&#8722;P/RNA condensates. Using microscopy techniques, supported by biophysical characterization, we found that the AMP LL&#8211;III partitions into the condensate, leading to clustering. Instead, the AMP CrACP1 partitions into the droplets without affecting their morphology but reducing their dynamics. Conversely, GKY20 leads to the formation of fibrillar structures after partitioning. It can be expected that such morphological transformation severely impairs the normal functionality of the N&#8722;P droplets and thus virion assembly. These results could pave the way for the development of a new class of AMP&#8208;based antiviral agents targeting biocondensates.

         <title>Injectable Chitosan Hydrogels Doped with 2D Peptide Nanosheet&#8208;Drug Conjugates for Glutathione&#8208;Responsive Sustained Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecule&#8208;responsive drug release system based on 2D peptide nanosheets (PNSs) has been developed by using chitosan (CS) hydrogel as a sustained&#8208;release platform. The PNS&#8208;CS&#8208;based drug delivery system demonstrates outstanding pH&#8208;responsiveness and sustained drug release capabilities, and the improved cellular uptake shown offers potential for biomedical applications.







Abstract
The development of novel and effective drug delivery systems aimed at enhancing therapeutic profile and efficacy of therapeutic agents is a critical challenge in modern medicine. This study presents an intelligent drug delivery system based on self&#8208;assembled two&#8208;dimensional peptide nanosheets (2D PNSs). Leveraging the tunable properties of amino acid structures and sequences, we design a peptide with the sequence of Fmoc&#8208;FKKGSHC, which self&#8208;assembles into 2D PNSs with uniform structure, high biocompatibility, and excellent degradability. Covalent attachment of thiol&#8208;modified doxorubicin (DOX) drugs to 2D PNSs via disulfide bond results in the peptide&#8208;drug conjugates (PDCs), which is denoted as PNS&#8208;SS&#8208;DOX. Subsequently, the PDCs are encapsulated within the injectable, thermosensitive chitosan (CS) hydrogels for drug delivery. The designed drug delivery system demonstrates outstanding pH&#8208;responsiveness and sustained drug release capabilities, which are facilitated by the characteristics of the CS hydrogels. Meanwhile, the covalently linked disulfide bond within the PNS&#8208;SS&#8208;DOX is responsive to intracellular glutathione (GSH) within tumor cells, enabling controlled drug release and significantly inhibiting the cancer cell growth. This responsive peptide&#8208;drug conjugate based on a 2D peptide nanoplatform paves the way for the development of smart drug delivery systems and has bright prospects in the future biomedicine field.

This responsive peptide-drug conjugate based on a 2D peptide nanoplatform paves the way for the development of smart drug delivery systems and has bright prospects in the future biomedicine field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unravelling the Role of Free Radicals in Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photogenerated radicals have good redox properties, thus promoting the widespread application of photocatalysis for environmental treatment and organic synthesis. The generation and application of photogenerated radicals are related to carriers and reactive molecules, such as a variety of alkane radicals in photocatalytic dissolution. In this conceptual article, we discuss some basic properties of photogenerated radicals and recent related research work.







Abstract
Free radicals are increasingly recognized as active intermediate reactive species that can participate in various redox processes, significantly influencing the mechanistic pathways of reactions. Numerous researchers have investigated the generation of one or more distinct photogenerated radicals, proposing various hypotheses to explain the reaction mechanisms. Notably, recent research has demonstrated the emergence of photogenerated radicals in innovative processes, including organic chemical reactions and the photocatalytic dissolution of precious metals. To harness the potential of these free radicals more effectively, it is imperative to consolidate and analyze the processes and action modes of these photogenerated radicals. This conceptual paper delves into the latest advancements in understanding the mechanics of photogenerated radicals.

         <title>Modular Divergent Synthesis of Indole Alkaloid Derivatives by an Atypical Ugi Multicomponent Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A complex pentacyclic ketimine undergoes a fully diastereoselective Ugi&#8208;type multicomponent reaction with various isocyanides and carboxylic acids to give a range of non&#8208;natural indole alkaloid derivatives. DFT calculations show that the reaction proceeds via a hydrogen bonding mechanism and that the stereoselectivity is primarily governed by ring strain considerations.







Abstract
We present an Ugi multicomponent approach to explore the chemical space around Aspidosperma&#8208;type monoterpene indole alkaloids. By variation of the isocyanide and carboxylic acid inputs we demonstrate the rapid generation of molecular diversity and the possibility to introduce handles for further modification. The key Ugi three&#8208;component reaction showed full diastereoselectivity towards the cis&#8208;fused ring system, which can be rationalized by DFT calculations that moreover indicate that the reaction proceeds via a Passerini&#8208;type hydrogen bonding mechanism. Several post&#8208;Ugi modifications were also performed, including Pictet&#8208;Spengler cyclization to highly complex nonacyclic natural product hybrid scaffolds.

         <title>Supramolecular Control of the Temperature Responsiveness of Fluorescent Macrocyclic Molecular Rotamers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular motion of macrocyclic carbazole macrocycles (CarROTs) is controlled through the external addition of anions, cations or through deprotonation allowing four discreet rotational speeds to be accessed, which in turn stop, reduce or enhance the thermoluminescent properties due to increasing or decreasing non&#8208;radiative decay processes, thereby providing a means to externally control the temperature sensitivity of the system.







Abstract
To fully harness the potential of molecular machines, it is crucial to develop methods by which to exert control over their speed of motion through the application of external stimuli. A conformationally strained macrocyclic fluorescent rotamer, CarROT, displays a reproducible and linear fluorescence decrease towards temperature over the physiological temperature range. Through the external addition of anions, cations or through deprotonation, the compound can access four discreet rotational speeds via supramolecular interactions (very slow, slow, fast and very fast) which in turn stop, reduce or enhance the thermoluminescent properties due to increasing or decreasing non&#8208;radiative decay processes, thereby providing a means to externally control the temperature sensitivity of the system. Through comparison with analogues with a higher degree of conformational freedom, the high thermosensitivity of CarROT over the physiological temperature range was determined to be due to conformational strain, which causes a high energy barrier to rotation over this range. Analogues with a higher degree of conformational freedom display lower sensitivities towards temperature over the same temperature range. This study provides an example of an information rich small molecule, in which programable rotational speed states can be observed with facile read&#8208;out.

         <title>Genetically Fusing Order&#8208;Promoting and Thermoresponsive Building Blocks to Design Hybrid Biomaterials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discusses strategies for enhancing the structural diversity of intrinsically disordered elastin&#8208;like polypeptides (ELPs) and resilin&#8208;like polypeptides (RLPs) through genetic fusion with ordered helical or beta sheet domains, aiming to generate well&#8208;structured, stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular materials on the nanoscale.







Abstract
The unique biophysical and biochemical properties of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and their recombinant derivatives, intrinsically disordered protein polymers (IDPPs) offer opportunities for producing multistimuli&#8208;responsive materials; their sequence&#8208;encoded disorder and tendency for phase separation facilitate the development of multifunctional materials. This review highlights the strategies for enhancing the structural diversity of elastin&#8208;like polypeptides (ELPs) and resilin&#8208;like polypeptides (RLPs), and their self&#8208;assembled structures via genetic fusion to ordered motifs such as helical or beta sheet domains. In particular, this review describes approaches that harness the synergistic interplay between order&#8208;promoting and thermoresponsive building blocks to design hybrid biomaterials, resulting in well&#8208;structured, stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular materials ordered on the nanoscale.

         <title>Synthesis and Structural Revision of a Natural Tetrasaccharide from Starfish Asterias rollestoni Bell</title>

The synthesis and structural revision of the natural 2&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylated tetrasaccharides via dual DPPA&#8208;directed [2+2] glycosylation.







Abstract
Starfish provide important saponins with diverse bioactivities as the secondary metabolites, among which 2&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylated glycosides are commonly found. Preparation of those 1,2&#8208;trans 2&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylated glycosides usually relies on 2&#8208;O&#8208;acyl participation requiring the selective installation and cleavage of 2&#8208;O&#8208;acyl groups. A convergent synthesis using 2&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylated oligosaccharide donors would be more straightforward but also pose greater challenges. Herein, we report a convergent synthesis of a distinctive tetrasaccharide isolated from starfish Asterias rollestoni Bell. Dual 2&#8208;(diphenylphosphinoyl)acetyl (DPPA) groups at O3 and O4 on galactose moiety led to high &#946;&#8208;selectivities (&#946;/&#945;=12/1 or &#946; only) in the challenging [2+2] glycosylation, giving the desired tetrasaccharides in &gt;90&#8201;% yields from the 2&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylated disaccharide donors. These synthetic studies have also unambiguously revised the structure of these natural tetrasaccharides. This work would facilitate further studies on new inhibitors of &#945;&#8208;glucosidase as hypoglycemic drugs.

A gel polymer electrolyte, rooted in poly(urethane&#8208;urea) chemistry, has been synthesized by a post immersion method, which allows for precise manipulation of its mechanical and electrical properties. This polymer electrolyte demonstrates exceptional dendritic resistance and outstanding self&#8208;healing features, with significant potential for application in lithium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have garnered extensive attention as potential alternatives to traditional liquid electrolytes, primarily due to their prowess in curbing lithium dendrite formation and preventing electrolyte leaks. The quest for SPEs that are both mechanically robust and exhibit superior ionic conductivity has been vigorous. However, achieving a harmonious balance between these two attributes remains a significant challenge. In this study, we introduce a novel quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte, ingeniously crafted from a poly(urethane&#8208;urea) network, enriched with lithium salts and plasticizers. This innovative composition not only boasts remarkable toughness but also ensures commendable ionic conductivity. Our post&#8208;gelation method yields gel polymer electrolytes that undergo rigorous evaluation, leading to an optimized version that stands out with its exceptional room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity (2.94&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and outstanding toughness (11.9 MJ m&#8722;3). Moreover, it demonstrates a broad electrochemical window (4.73&#8197;V), remarkable stability across a 600&#8208;hour cycle test, a high capacity retention exceeding 80&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles at 0.2&#8197;C, and a noteworthy self&#8208;healing capability. This quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolyte emerges as a promising contender to replace current liquid electrolyte solutions.

         <title>Synthesis of Superbulky Amide Ligands by Addition of Polar Reagents to Sila&#8211;Imine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superbulky amide ligands are generally not accessible by deprotonation of their parent amines. Addition of polar reagents to a sila&#8208;imine precursor gave a range of metal complexes with superbulky amide ligands that generally act as weakly coordinating anions.







Abstract
The chemistry of extremely bulky amide ligands is troubled by difficulties in deprotonation of the parent amine. As an alternative route to superbulky amide reagents, the addition of polar reagents to a sila&#8211;imine has been investigated. Attempts to synthesize the superbulky amide anion (tBu3Si)2N&#8722; by addition of tBuLi to tBu2Si=N(SitBu3) failed and gave tBu3Si(tBu2HSi)NLi and isobutene. Reaction of the sila&#8211;imine with KOtBu successfully led to tBu3Si[tBu2(tBuO)Si]NK which crystallized as a separated ion&#8211;pair. Reaction with the slightly bulkier KOAd (Ad=1&#8208;adamantyl) led in presence of THF to ether ring&#8211;opening. Reaction with tBuOH gave tBu3Si[tBu2(tBuO)Si]NH but this amine cannot be easily deprotonated. Reaction with (BDI*)MgnBu in presence of THF gave (BDI*)Mg+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(THF)2 and the non&#8211;coordinating anion tBu3Si[tBu2(nBu)Si]N&#8722;; BDI*=&#223;&#8208;diketiminate ligand HC[C(tBu)N&#8722;DIPP]2, DIPP=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl. Reaction of Mg(nBu)2 with tBu2Si=N(SitBu3) led to a Mg complex with one amide ligand: tBu3Si[tBu2(nBu)Si]N&#8722;. The other superbulky amide anion isomerized by internal deprotonation of a tBu&#8208;substituent to give a primary carbanion that is also coordinated to Mg. Although the amide&#8211;to&#8211;carbanion isomerization is highly contrathermodynamic, it allows for coordination of both anions to a single Mg center. The new bulky amides are rare cases of halogen&#8211;free weakly coordinating anions.

         <title>Dehydro[12]&#8208; and [18]annulene&#8208;Fused Ball&#8208;Shaped Ruthenium Complex Oligomers: Synthesis, Aromatic/Antiaromatic Effect, and Symmetry for Near&#8208;Infrared Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;step synthesis of ball&#8208;shaped ruthenium complex oligomers has been realized. The process involves the Eglinton coupling of alkyne&#8208;substituted ruthenium complexes, allowing selective oligomer formation. NMR and magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy confirm annulene&#8216;s influence on chromophores. The resulting oligomers demonstrate increased absorption coefficients in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region, providing an efficient strategy for controlling NIR optical properties.







Abstract
The appropriate arrangement of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) chromophores allows for the modification of the peak wavelength in the NIR region and efficient use of NIR light. However, the preparation of novel NIR chromophores using simple procedures remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report the synthesis of ball&#8208;shaped ruthenium complex oligomers. The metal complexes can be synthesized in a single step and interact strongly with NIR light. Alkyne&#8208;substituted low&#8208;symmetry ball&#8208;shaped ruthenium complexes were synthesized and subjected to Eglinton coupling to obtain dehydro[12] and [18]annulene&#8208;fused dimers and trimers. Fine&#8208;tuning of the reaction conditions led to the selective synthesis of the target oligomers. NMR spectroscopy confirmed that the 18&#960;&#8208;aromatic and 12&#960;&#8208;antiaromatic properties of the annulene influenced the ruthenium complex chromophore, and magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy showed changes in the electronic structure of their excited state owing to molecular&#8208;symmetry differences. The absorption coefficient in the NIR region of the absorption spectra of the oligomers increased significantly, supporting the efficient use of light by oligomerization. The formation of oligomers using ball&#8208;shaped metal complexes is a simple and effective strategy for controlling NIR optical properties.

         <title>Composition and Conformation of Hetero&#8208; versus Homo&#8208;Fluorinated Triazolamers Influence their Activity on Islet Amyloid Polypeptide Aggregation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
While fluorinated molecules constitute nearly 30&#8201;% of all newly approved drugs, and peptidomimetic foldamers provide original solutions to resolve certain peptide problems, the interest of fluorinated foldamers is still little addressed. The conformational and biological interest of fluorinated triazolamers as an alternative to natural peptides is demonstrated here.







Abstract
Novel fluorinated foldamers based on aminomethyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;difluoroacetic acid (1,4&#8208;Tz&#8722;CF2) units were synthesized and their conformational behaviour was studied by NMR and molecular dynamics. Their activity on the aggregation of the human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) amyloid protein was evaluated by fluorescence spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. The fluorine labelling of these foldamers allowed the analysis of their interaction with the target protein. We demonstrated that the preferred extended conformation of homotriazolamers of 1,4&#8208;Tz&#8722;CF2 unit increases the aggregation of hIAPP, while the hairpin&#8208;like conformation of more flexible heterotriazolamers containing two 1,4&#8208;Tz&#8722;CF2 units mixed with natural amino acids from the hIAPP sequence reduces it, and more efficiently than the parent natural peptide. The longer heterotriazolamers having three 1,4&#8208;Tz&#8722;CF2 units adopting more folded hairpin&#8208;like and ladder&#8208;like structures similar to short multi&#8208;stranded &#946;&#8208;sheets have no effect. This work demonstrates that a good balance between the structuring and flexibility of these foldamers is necessary to allow efficient interaction with the target protein.

In or out? Contrarily to the well&#8208;established tendency of 1&#8208;methylcyclopropene compounds to isomerize to the corresponding methylenecyclopropanes, the spiro&#8208;derivative MeCP is refractory towards its conversion into MCP. The reasons of this unexpected behavior were unraveled by high&#8208;level computations, which showed that in the case under exam the endocyclic C&#8722;C double bond isomer is more stable than the exocyclic one by around 2.5&#8211;3.0&#8197;Kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1.







Abstract
The structure of the spirocyclic product obtained by reacting catechol with 1,1&#8208;dichloro&#8208;2&#8208;(chloromethyl)cyclopropane is shown by NMR and X&#8208;ray analysis to be that of a 2&#8208;methylcyclopropene (MeCP), instead of the previously reported 2&#8208;methylenecyclopropane (MCP) one. The study of the equilibration between the two isomeric forms by experimental and computational means (including both Density Functional Theory &#8211; DFT &#8211; and Coupled Cluster with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations &#8211; CCSD(T) &#8211; calculations) revealed that, at variance with most of the alkylidenecyclopropane/alkylcyclopropene systems described to date, for the compounds of the present study the MeCP derivative is more stable by&#8776; 2.5&#8211;3.0&#8197;Kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 than the MCP one. The extension of the DFT and CCSD(T) study to other spiro&#8208;MCP/MeCP pairs suggests that the origin of the unexpected shift of the equilibrium position can be tracked back to a combination of electronic and ring&#8208;strain effects. These findings lead to re&#8208;think a long&#8208;standing, and substantially undisputed belief in the area of unsaturated cyclopropane derivatives.

&#8220;Could we extend the life time of the photocatalytic systems by designing an ad&#8208;hoc porous polymer that allowed a supramolecular architecture while slowing down the disassembly of the quantasome?&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at 10.1002/chem.202303784).







Abstract
Invited for the cover of this issue are the groups of Marcella Bonchio at the University of Padova and J&#233;r&#244;me Canivet at the CNRS&#8211;University of Lyon. The image depicts the hierarchical self&#8208;organization of bio&#8208;inspired quantasomes, crosslinked within a polystyrene network to enchain their lateral and orthogonal proximity for long&#8208;lasting oxygen evolution using green photons.

A &#8220;Ukrainian diazoalkane train&#8221; arrives at Kyiv station where a new representative of the diazoalkane family is waiting to board. Over the last two decades, several diazoalkanes relevant to medicinal chemistry have been studied extensively by Ukrainian chemists. Now, the synthesis and [3+2] cycloaddition reactions of (diazomethyl)dimethylphosphine oxide (Me&#8322;P(O)CHN&#8322;), a novel diazoalkane reagent, are described for the first time. More information can be found in the Research Article by O.&#8197;O. Grygorenko and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303972). Artwork by Vitalii Boklashchuk.

         <title>Enabling High Activation of Glucose&#8208;6&#8208;Phosphate Dehydrogenase Activity Through Liquid Condensate Formation and Compression</title>

Temperature and pressure dependence of the glycolytic G6PDH reaction forming NADPH/PLL droplets as the enzymatic reaction proceeds: Incorporation of the reactants in the droplet phase led to a boost in enzymatic activity, which was most pronounced at medium&#8208;high pressures.







Abstract
Droplet formation via liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation is thought to be involved in the regulation of various biological processes, including enzymatic reactions. We investigated a glycolytic enzymatic reaction, the conversion of glucose&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate to 6&#8208;phospho&#8208;D&#8208;glucono&#8208;1,5&#8208;lactone with concomitant reduction of NADP+ to NADPH both in the absence and presence of dynamically controlled liquid droplet formation. Here, the nucleotide serves as substrate as well as the scaffold required for the formation of liquid droplets. To further expand the process parameter space, temperature and pressure dependent measurements were performed. Incorporation of the reactants in the liquid droplet phase led to a boost in enzymatic activity, which was most pronounced at medium&#8208;high pressures. The crowded environment of the droplet phase induced a marked increase of the affinity of the enzyme and substrate. An increase in turnover number in the droplet phase at high pressure contributed to a further strong increase in catalytic efficiency. Enzyme systems that are dynamically coupled to liquid condensate formation may be the key to deciphering many biochemical reactions. Expanding the process parameter space by adjusting temperature and pressure conditions can be a means to further increase the efficiency of industrial enzyme utilization and help uncover regulatory mechanisms adopted by extremophiles.
