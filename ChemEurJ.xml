         <title>Ultralow Loading and High&#8208;Performing Ionic Liquid&#8208;Immobilizing Rhodium Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Hydroformylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have developed a Keggin polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;based ionic liquid (IL)&#8208;immobilizing rhodium single&#8208;atom Rh catalyst (MTOA)5[SiW11O39Rh] (MOTA=methyltrioctylammonium cation), which can afford exceptionally high catalytic activity for the hydroformylation of alkenes to produce aldehydes at an ultralow loading of Rh (ca. 3 ppm). For styrene hydroformylation, both the conversion and the yield of the aldehyde can reach almost 99%, and the TOF was obtained as high as 9000 h&#8208;1 without usage of any phosphine ligand in the reaction process. The further characterization by FT&#8208;IR, ICP and ESI&#8208;MS analysis revealed that the Rh single atom was incorporated in the lacunary POM anions. Especially, the bulky IL cation can provide an additional role in stabilizing Rh species and thus prevented from aggregation and leaching of Rh species. The IL catalyst was miscible with n&#8208;hexane under the elevated temperature conditions, which contributed to exceptionally high activity for hydroformylation even at ultra&#8208;low loading of IL catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Water Sorption Controls Extreme Single&#8208;Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Single Crystal Molecular Reorganization in Hydrogen Bonded Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Because hydrogen bonded frameworks are held together by relatively weak interactions, they often form several different frameworks under slightly different synthesis conditions, and respond dynamically to stimuli such as heat and vacuum. However, these dynamic restructuring processes are often poorly understood. In this work, three isoreticular hydrogen bonded organic frameworks assembled through charge&#8208;assisted amidinium&#183;&#183;&#183;carboxylate hydrogen bonds (1C/C, 1Si/C and 1Si/Si) are studied. Three distinct phases for 1C/C and four for 1Si/C and 1Si/Si are fully structurally characterized. The transitions between these phases involve extreme yet recoverable molecular&#8208;level framework reorganization. It is demonstrate that these transformations are related to water content and can be controlled by humidity, and that the non&#8208;porous anhydrous phase of 1C/C shows reversible water sorption through single crystal to crystal restructuring. This mechanistic insight opens the way for the future use of the inherent dynamism present in hydrogen bonded frameworks.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Oxygenated Sesquiterpenoids Enabled by Combining Metabolic Engineering and Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bio&#8208;Chem collaboration: Escherichia coli fermentation and visible&#8208;light photocatalysis were combined in a complementary way for the first time, to realize the scaffold assembly in a &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; fashion and the subsequent diversifications in a &#8220;one&#8208;step&#8221; manner, respectively, enabling the production of six sesquiterpenoids.







Abstract
The diversification of natural products to expand biologically relevant chemical space for drug discovery can be achieved by combining complementary bioprocessing and chemical transformations. Herein, genetically engineered Escherichia coli fermentation to produce amorphadiene and valencene was combined with metal&#8208;free photocatalysis transformations to further access nootkatone, cis&#8208;nootkatol and two hydration derivatives. In fermentation, using a closed, anaerobic condition avoided the use of organic overlay, increased the productivity, and simplified the work&#8208;up process. Metal&#8208;free photocatalysis hydration and allylic C&#8722;H oxidation were designed and implemented to make the whole process greener. It was shown that the anti&#8208;Markovnikov selectivity of photocatalyzed alkene hydration could be reversed by stereo&#8208;electronic and steric effects existing in complex natural products. The combination of bioprocessing and photocatalysis may provide an efficient and greener way to expand the chemical space for pharmaceutical, flavor and fragrance industry.

         <title>Alkylation of Nitroarenes via Vicarious Nucleophilic Substitution &#8211; Experimental and DFT Mechanistic Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkylation of nitroarenes via Vicarious Nucleophilic Substitution (VNS) was tested experimentally and modelled with DFT calculations. Mechanistic studies reveal intrinsic differences between reactions of archetypal carbanion precursor PhSO2CH2Cl, and alkyl phenyl sulfones, in which benzenesulfinate acts as a leaving group. Accordingly, for the latter precursors steric hindrance develops at the &#946;&#8208;elimination step, that raises energy barrier and results in the formation of byproducts.

Abstract
Cu&#8208;Catalyzed radical/iminium domino strategy (RIDS) for the efficient synthesis of quaternary&#8208;carbon&#8208;containing &#947;&#8208;lactam&#8208;based multiheterocyclic structures from &#945;&#8208;bromocarboxamides is reported. This domino reaction strategy enables the construction of multiheterocycles in one step. Mechanistic studies showed that two catalytically generated iminiums are likely to be key intermediates in the catalytic cycle. The developed method can be used in a chemoselective manner to produce multicyclic products in the reaction with ketones possessing two different carbonyls.

         <title>Study of Carbamoyl Fluoride: Synthesis, Properties and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
F plan: Carbamoyl fluorides can be synthesized easily and safely under metal&#8208;free and inexpensive conditions. These compounds are stable under a wide range of conditions, especially close to physiologic ones. In addition, they can be radiolabeled by 18F/19F isotopic exchange.







Abstract
Carbamoyl fluoride is a fluorinated group that, to this date, remains underexplored, probably due to the lack of data concerning its properties. In this paper, a study of carbamoyl fluoride is presented. Stability studies, in particular under physiological conditions, and lipophilicity measurement were performed. A new easy, safe, inexpensive, and metal&#8208;free synthesis method is also described. Finally, a potential use in radiochemistry through a 18F/19F isotopic exchange is demonstrated.

         <title>Dipyrromethane&#8208;Based PGeP Pincer Germyl Rhodium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PGeP pincers: A family of germyl rhodium(I) PGeP pincer complexes has been prepared from a metal&#8208;free germylene based on a dipyrromethane scaffold functionalized with two phosphane sidearms. These complexes have shown a rich derivative chemistry both at the germanium (chloride substitutions) and rhodium atoms (ligand substitutions, oxidative additions), providing tetra&#8208;, penta&#8208; and hexacoordinate rhodium complexes, some of which are also active catalyst precursors (olefin hydroboration).







Abstract
A family of germyl rhodium complexes derived from the PGeP germylene 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bis(di&#8208;isopropylphosphanylmethyl)&#8208;5,5&#8217;&#8208;dimethyldipyrromethane&#8208;1,1&#8217;&#8208;diylgermanium(II), Ge(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2 (1), has been prepared. Germylene 1 reacted readily with [RhCl(PPh3)3] and [RhCl(cod)(PPh3)] (cod=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene) to give, in both cases, the PGeP&#8208;pincer chloridogermyl rhodium(I) derivative [Rh{&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeCl(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2}(PPh3)] (2). Similarly, the reaction of 1 with [RhCl(cod)(MeCN)] afforded [Rh{&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeCl(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2}(MeCN)] (3). The methoxidogermyl and methylgermyl rhodium(I) complexes [Rh{&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeR(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2}(PPh3)] (R=OMe, 4; Me, 5) were prepared by treating complex 2 with LiOMe and LiMe, respectively. Complex 5 readily reacted with CO to give the carbonyl rhodium(I) derivative [Rh{&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeR(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2}(CO)] (6), with HCl, HSnPh3 and Ph2S2 rendering the pentacoordinate methylgermyl rhodium(III) complexes [RhHX{&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeMe(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2}] (X=Cl, 7; SnPh3, 8) and [Rh(SPh)2{&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeMe(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2}] (9), respectively, and with H2 to give the hexacoordinate derivative [RhH2{&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeMe(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2}(PPh3)] (10). Complexes 3 and 5 are catalyst precursors for the hydroboration of styrene, 4&#8208;vinyltoluene and 4&#8208;vinylfluorobenzene with catecholborane under mild conditions.

         <title>Effect of Annulation Mode of Twistarene on the Physical Property and Self&#8208;Assembly Behavior of Functionalized Curved Aromatic Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Constructing novel curved polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons is of great significance. Herein this work describes the design and modular preparation of four novel arenes where their structures are determined via X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. The effect of annulation mode of twistarenes on the physical properties, self&#8208;assembly behaviors and switchable photoconductivity of such curved molecules were investigated in detail.







Abstract
Four novel curved polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3&#8201;a, 5, 8, 15&#8201;a have been synthesized and characterized, where molecules 3&#8201;a and 15&#8201;a bear [5]carbohelicene units. X&#8208;ray single crystal analyses indicate that compound 3&#8201;a shows offset packing arrangements of (P5)&#8208; and (M5)&#8208;isomers, and 15&#8201;a has a symmetrical plane and looks like a butterfly. In comparison, 8 exhibits a slightly curved structure, in which the significant convex&#8208;to&#8208;convex &#960;&#8208;overlap with the shortest distance of 3.42&#8197;&#197; occurs. In addition, the effect of annulation mode of twistarenes on the physical properties, self&#8208;assembly behaviors, and switchable photoconductivity of the as&#8208;prepared curved aromatic compounds were further examined in a comparative manner.

         <title>Lanthanide SMMs Based on Belt Macrocycles: Recent Advances and General Trends</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A belt to control anisotropy. This review presents the development of mononuclear lanthanide SMMs based on belt macrocycles. Literature systems are classified in crown ethers, Schiff&#8208;base and metallacrown complexes. Molecule families are compared in terms of their coordination number and geometry, focusing on the degree of structural distortion associated with different belt macrocycles. General trends with respect to demagnetization barriers and effective suppression of transverse magnetic anisotropy components are also discussed.







Abstract
Enhancement of axial magnetic anisotropy is the central objective to push forward the performance of Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet (SMM) complexes. In the case of mononuclear lanthanide complexes, the chemical environment around the paramagnetic ion must be tuned to place strongly interacting ligands along either the axial positions or the equatorial plane, depending on the oblate or prolate preference of the selected lanthanide. One classical strategy to achieve a precise chemical environment for a metal centre is using highly structured, chelating ligands. A natural approach for axial&#8208;equatorial control is the employment of macrocycles acting in a belt conformation, providing the equatorial coordination environment, and leaving room for axial ligands. In this review, we present a survey of SMMs based on the macrocycle belt motif. Literature systems are divided in three families (crown ether, Schiff&#8208;base and metallacrown) and their general properties in terms of structural stability and SMM performance are briefly discussed.

         <title>Controlling the Flexibility of MIL&#8208;88A(Sc) Through Synthetic Optimisation and Postsynthetic Halogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The flexibility of the MOF MIL&#8208;88A(Sc) is described and compared to its well&#8208;established Fe analogue. Its breathing behaviour can be controlled through installation of formate bridges during synthesis that ensure rigidity by structural buttressing, or by postsynthetic bromination of the fumarate linker to induce rigidity by the steric influence of the bulky linker substituents.







Abstract
Breathing behaviour in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), the distinctive transformation between a porous phase and a less (or non) porous phase, often controls the uptake of guest molecules, endowing flexible MOFs with highly selective gas adsorptive properties. In highly flexible topologies, breathing can be tuned by linker modification, which is typically achieved pre&#8208;synthetically using functionalised linkers. Herein, it was shown that MIL&#8208;88A(Sc) exhibits the characteristic flexibility of its topology, which can be tuned by 1) modifying synthetic conditions to yield a formate&#8208;buttressed analogue that is rigid and porous; and 2) postsynthetic bromination across the alkene functionality of the fumarate ligand, generating a product that is rigid but non&#8208;porous. In addition to providing different methodologies for tuning the flexibility and breathing behaviour of this archetypal MOF, it was shown that bromination of the formate&#8208;bridged analogue results in an identical material, representing a rare example of two different MOFs being postsynthetically converted to the same end product.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Platform for Novel Reaction Discovery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Detection of new chemical bond formation in high&#8208;throughput synthesis is limited by the efficiency and scalability of reaction product detection, as conventional methods for product isolation from reaction mixtures are time consuming and labor intensive. Here, we report a miniaturizable purification method that enables rapid, high&#8208;throughput isolation of quaternary ammonium&#8208;tagged products from reaction mixtures with excellent purity using inexpensive equipment that can be easily set up in a typical organic chemistry laboratory. This novel purification technique enabled us to establish a high&#8208;throughput reaction discovery platform. We validated this platform in a screen of 1536 reactions, which identified one&#160;previously unreported transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Adipic Esters and Adiponitrile via Photoassisted Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Alkene Hydrodimerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct hydrodimerization of acrylates and acrylonitrile offers a general streamlined access to industrially important intermediates to nylon 6,6. However, a practical catalytic method for this process has thus far underdeveloped owing to the challenges in regioselectivity and environmental compatibility of applied reagents. Here, we report a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail hydrodimerization of activated alkenes driven by a visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis at ambient temperature, which is applicable to both adipates and adiponitrile synthesis from potentially renewable feedstocks. This protocol utilizes half equivalent of hantzsch ester as a recyclable two&#8208;electron and two&#8208;proton donor with the assistance of catalytic amount of base as a proton shuttle, and has been shown to be highly regioselective and efficient for hydrodimerizing various activated alkenes to 1,4&#8208;difunctionalized butane derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanism Insight into Photo&#8208;induced Damages of Unnatural Base Pair</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical&#8208; and photo&#8208;stability of unnatural base pairs (UBPs) are important to maintain the genetic code integrity, and critical for developing healthy semisynthetic organisms. As reported, dTPT3 was less stable upon irradiation, and thus might act as a pervasive photosensitizer to induce oxidative damages within DNA, causing harm to living semi&#8208;synthetic organisms when exposed to UVA radiation. However, there was no knowledge about molecular&#8208;level understanding of this damage process. In this paper, we not only identified four photoproducts of dTPT3, including desulfur&#8208;dTPT3 (dTPT3  H  ), TPT3 sulphinate (TPT3  SO2  ), TPT3 sulphonate (TPT3  SO3  ) and TPT3&#8208;thioTPT3 (TPT3  S  TPT3), but also established a Type II photosensitized oxidation mechanism. In addition, the antioxidant (sodium ascorbate) was able to effectively inhibit the photoproducts formation of dTPT3 and dTPT3 in DNA, suggesting that a reductive environment might protect DNA bearing dTPT3 against UVA oxidation and ameliorate its adverse biological effects. The comprehensive understanding of TPT3&#8217; photochemical stability will give researchers helpful guidance to design more photo&#8208;stable UBPs and construct healthier semisynthetic organisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Transformations of Strained Three&#8208;Membered Rings as Common, Yet Overlooked Motif in Heavy&#8208;Atom Tunneling Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quantum mechanical tunneling has long been recognized as an important phenomenon when considering transformations dominated by a lightweight hydrogen atom. Tunneling of heavier atoms like carbon, initially dismissed as negligible, has seen a quickly increasing number of computationally predicted and/or experimentally confirmed examples over the last decade, highlighting its importance for a wide variety of reactions. However, no common structural motif has been pointed out within these seemingly unconnected examples, strongly limiting the predictability of the impact of heavy&#8208;atom tunneling on a given reaction. This Concept Article will provide this perspective and showcase how the recognition of the formation and cleavage of three&#8208;membered rings as common motif can inform the prediction and research into heavy&#8208;atom tunneling reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Spectroscopic signature of dynamical instability of the aqueous complex in the brown&#8208;ring nitrate test</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemistry of the brown&#8208;ring test has been investigated for nearly a century. Though recent studies have focused on solid state structure determination and the measurement of spectra, mechanistic details and kinetics, the aspects of solution structure and dynamics remain unknown. We have investigated structural fluctuations of the brown&#8208;ring complex in aqueous solution with ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, from which we identified that the classically established pseudo&#8208;octahedral [Fe(H2O)5(NO)]2+  complex is present along with a square&#8208;pyramidal&#160;[Fe(H2O)4(NO)]2+  complex. Based on the inability in multi&#8208;reference calculations to reproduce the experimental UV&#8208;vis spectra in aqueous solution by inclusion of thermal fluctuations of the [Fe(H2O)5(NO)]2+  complex alone, we propose the existence of an equilibrium between pseudo&#8208;octahedral and square&#8208;pyramidal complexes. Despite challenges in constructing models reproducing the solid&#8208;state UV&#8208;vis spectrum, the advanced spectrum simulation tool motivates us to challenge the established picture of a sole pseudo&#8208;octahedral complex in solution.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two novel imide/imine&#8208;based organic cages were prepared and studied as materials for the selective separation of CO  2  from N  2  and CH  4  in Vacuum Swing Adsorption conditions. Gas adsorption on the new compounds showed selectivity for CO  2  over N  2  and CH  4  . The cages were also tested as fillers in mixed&#8208;matrix membranes for gas separation. Dense and robust membranes were obtained by loading the cages in either Matrimid  &#174;  or PEEK&#8208;WC polymers. Improved gas transport properties and selectivity for CO  2  were achieved compared to the neat polymer membranes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Coordination Network Featuring Two Distinct Copper(II) Coordination Environments for Highly Selective Acetylene Adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single crystals of 2D coordination network {Cu2L2&#183;(DMF)3(H2O)3}n (1&#8209;DMF) were prepared by reaction of commercial reagents 3&#8208;formyl&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxybenzoic acid (H2L) and Cu(NO3)2 in dimethylformamide (DMF). The single&#8208;crystal structure shows two distinct Cu(II) coordination environments arising from the separate coordination of Cu(II) cations to the carboxylate and salicylaldehydato moieties on the linker, with 1D channels running through the structure. Flexibility is exhibited on solvent exchange with ethanol and tetrahydrofuran, while porosity and the unique overall connectivity of the structure are retained. The activated material exhibits type I gas sorption behaviour and a BET surface area of 950&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1 (N2, 77&#160;K). Notably, the framework adsorbs negligible quantities of CH4 compared with CO2 and the C2Hn hydrocarbons. It exhibits exceptional selectivity for C2H2/CH4 and C2H2/C2Hn, which has applicability in separation technologies for the isolation of C2H2.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Activation of Small Molecules by a Stable Chiral Silene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of the dilithium salt of the enantiopure (  S  )&#8208;BINOL (1,1&#8217;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol) with two equivalents of the amidinate&#8208;stabilized chlorosilylene L  Ph  SiCl (L  Ph  = PhC(N  t  Bu)  2  ) led to the formation of the first example of a chiral cyclic silene species comprising a (  S  )&#8208;BINOL ligand. The reactivity of the Si=C bond was investigated by reaction with elemental sulfur, CO  2  and HCl. Reaction with S  8  led to a Si=C bond cleavage and concomitant to a ring&#8208;opened product with imine and silanethione functional groups. Reaction with CO  2  resulted in cleaving of the CO  2  molecule into a carbonyl group and an isolated O atom, while one new stereocenter is formed in a highly selective manner. According to DFT calculations, the [2+2] cycloaddition product is the key intermediate. Further reactivity studies of the chiral cyclic silene with HCl resulted in a stereoselective addition to the Si=C bond, while the fully selective formation of two stereocenters was achieved. The quantitative stereoselective addition of CO  2  and HCl to a Si=C bond is unprecedented.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Mannosylerythritol Lipid Analogues and their Self&#8208;Assembling Properties, Recovery Effects on Damaged Skin Cells, and Antibacterial Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of three types of purpose&#8208;designed mannosylerythritol lipid (MEL)&#8208;D analogues with decanoyl groups (C10), &#946;&#8208;GlcEL&#8208;D, &#945;&#8208;GlcEL&#8208;D, and &#945;&#8208;MEL&#8208;D, was accomplished utilizing our boron&#8208;mediated aglycon delivery (BMAD) methods. Their self&#8208;assembling properties, recovery effects on damaged skin cells, and antibacterial activity were evaluated. It was revealed, for the first time, that &#945;&#8208;GlcEL&#8208;D&#160;and &#945;&#8208;MEL&#8208;D only generated giant vesicles, indicating that slight differences in the steric configuration of an erythritol moiety and fatty acyl chains affect the ability to form vesicles.

         <title>Synchrotron X&#8208;ray Electron Density Analysis of Chemical Bonding in Graphitic Carbon Nitride Precursor Melamine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Melamine is a precursor and building block for graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;CN) materials, a group of layered materials showing great promise for catalytic applications. The synthetic pathway to g&#8208;CN includes a polycondensation reaction of melamine by evaporation of ammonia. Melamine molecules in the crystal organize into wave&#8208;like planes with an interlayer distance of 3.3 &#197; similar to that of g&#8208;CN. Here we present an extensive investigation of the experimental electron density of melamine obtained from modelling of synchrotron radiation X&#8208;ray single crystal diffraction data measured at 25 K with special focus on the molecular geometry and intermolecular interactions. Both intra&#8208; and interlayer structures are dominated by hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;interactions. Theoretical gas phase optimizations of the experimental molecular geometry show that bond lengths and angles for atoms in same chemical environment (C&#8208;N bonds in the ring, amine groups) differ significantly more for the experimental geometry than for the gas phase optimized geometries, indicating that intermolecular interactions in the crystal affects the molecular geometry. In the experimental crystal geometry, one amine group has significantly more sp  3  &#8208;like character than the others, hinting towards a possible formation mechanism of g&#8208;CN. Topological analysis and energy frameworks show that the nitrogen atom in this amine group participates in weak intralayer hydrogen bonding. We hypothesize that melamine condenses to g&#8208;CN within the layers and that the unique amine group plays a key role in the condensation process.</dc:description>

         <title>Peri&#8208;Decoration of a Tetraazaperylene with Urea Units: Chiral Octaazaperopyrenedioxides (OAPPDOs) and their Optical and Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Octaazaperopyrenedioxides (  OAPPDO  s) are a new class of fluorescent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons based on a tetraazaperylene core which is formally condensed with N&#8208;substituted urea units in the two opposite  peri  positions. Here, we report the synthesis of series of substituted  OAPPDO  derivatives, with different N&#8208;substitution patterns (H, alkyl, benzyl) in the  peri  positions, including  bay  chlorinated  OAPPDO  s. Starting from the latter, a series of  bay  arylated  OAPPDO  s has been synthesized by Suzuki cross coupling which resulted in the formation of helically chiral  OAPPDO  derivatives. The electrochemical and photo physical properties were investigated by UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy as well as cyclic voltammetry. The  P  &#8208; and  M  &#8208;enantiomers of a phenylated  OAPPDO  were separated by semipreparative HPLC column chromatography and further analyzed by CD&#8208;spectroscopy. The frontier orbital energies, the mechanism of the isomerization, the electronic excitation and the CD spectrum (TD&#8208;DFT) were computed and compared to the experimental data. The reversible 1e  &#8208;  oxidation of the  OAPPDO  s generates the corresponding radical cations, one of which was characterized by EPR spectroscopy. The reversible oxidation process was also systematically investigated by spectroelectrochemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Aza&#8208;Ortho&#8208;Quinone Methides as Reactive Intermediates: Generation and Utility in Contemporary Asymmetric Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;quinone methide (aza&#8208;o&#8208;QM) chemistry has been showing budding progress in the past years. Herein, the asymmetric catalysis involving these transient intermediates is highlighted, which was made possible by well&#8208;designed catalysts as well as new aza&#8208;o&#8208;QM precursors/substrates.







Abstract
The aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;quinone methide (aza&#8208;o&#8208;QM) chemistry has overwhelmingly progressed in the past few decades. This review aims to integrate various transition metal&#8208;catalyzed and organocatalytic strategies in taming aza&#8208;o&#8208;QM intermediates, including the aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;vinylidene quinone methide (aza&#8208;o&#8208;VQM), aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;alkynyl quinone methide (aza&#8208;o&#8208;AQM), aza&#8208;para&#8208;quinone methide (aza&#8208;p&#8208;QM), and indole&#8208;based aza&#8208;o&#8208;QM analog. These transient species are often utilized for the direct and enantioselective synthesis of complex (hetero)polycyclic or fused&#8208;ring molecular scaffolds such as tetrahydroquinoline and indoline, among others, which are abundant in many natural products, bioactive compounds, and pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Installing Reduction Responsiveness into Biomolecules by Introducing Nitroaryl Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
RSVP: This Concept summarizes the molecular design of reduction&#8208;responsive biomolecules, such as peptides, nucleic acids, and saccharides, constructed by introducing nitroaryl groups into them, with a focus on simple 4&#8208;nitrobenzene&#8208;based motifs.







Abstract
Artificially synthesized stimuli&#8208;responsive biomolecules are attractive as molecular tools for monitoring and modulating biological systems. In biological systems, redox stimuli are common, and their dysregulation is typically linked to various abnormal or disease states. In this Concept article, the molecular design of reduction&#8208;responsive biomolecules, such as peptides, nucleic acids, and saccharides, which are produced by introducing nitroaryl groups into them, is reviewed with a special emphasis on simple 4&#8208;nitrobenzene&#8208;based motifs.

         <title>Persulfurated Benzene&#8208;Cored Asterisks with &#960;&#8208;Extended ThioNaphthyl Arms: Synthesis, Structural, Photophysical and Covalent Dynamic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regioisomeric asterisks (5&#8208;6) with naphthylthio arms are reported. Consequences on &#960;&#8208;extension around a persulfurated benzene bring different structural, photophysical and chemical properties. Sulfur exchanges reactions convert non emissive (5&#8211;6) into the best one (4). &#960;&#8208;Extension inhibits luminescence of a hexakis(phenylthio)benzene unit. Sc&#8208;XRD shows structural distortions and different behaviors of (5&#8211;6).







Abstract
The synthesis of regioisomeric asterisks (5) and (6) incorporating a benzene core with six 1&#8208;naphthylthio or six 2&#8208;naphthylthio arms are reported in search for new materials with optoelectronic properties. The consequences on the extension of a &#960; system surrounding a persulfurated benzene core provide a new avenue to study the structural, photophysical, and chemical properties of such family of all&#8208;organic phosphors. It also diverts the persulfuration mechanism after two radical cyclizations for making a [5]dithiohelicene by&#8208;product (7) and favors dynamic sulfur component exchange reactions surrounding the core. These exchanges convert asterisks (5) and (6), non&#8208;phosphorescent at 20&#8201;&#176;C to the highly phosphorescent (4) (&#981; &#8764;100&#8201;%, solid state at 20&#8201;&#176;C). For asterisks (5) and (6), the absence of the typical phosphorescence of the per(phenylthio)benzene core in the solid state at 20&#8201;&#176;C and the presence of a weak naphthalene&#8208;based phosphorescence at 77&#8197;K is attributed to an energy transfer from the triplet state of the persulfurated benzene core to the outer naphthalene moieties, resulting in an antenna system.

         <title>Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Activated Liposomal Cell Delivery using a Boronate&#8208;Caged Guanidine Lipid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A boronate&#8208;caged guanidine&#8208;lipid for enhancing liposome cellular delivery mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) was reported. Our results showcase that this lipid enables cell delivery only after being activated in the presence of ROS. This approach exhibits strong potential as an ROS&#8208;responsive liposomal platform for targeted drug delivery applications.







Abstract
We report boronate&#8208;caged guanidine&#8208;lipid 1 that activates liposomes for cellular delivery only upon uncaging of this compound by reactive oxygen species (ROS) to produce cationic lipid products. These liposomes are designed to mimic the exceptional cell delivery properties of cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs), while the inclusion of the boronate cage is designed to enhance selectivity such that cell entry will only be activated in the presence of ROS. Boronate uncaging by hydrogen peroxide was verified by mass spectrometry and zeta potential (ZP) measurements. A microplate&#8208;based fluorescence assay was developed to study the ROS&#8208;mediated vesicle interactions between 1&#8208;liposomes and anionic membranes, which were further elucidated via dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis. Cellular delivery studies utilizing fluorescence microscopy demonstrated significant enhancements in cellular delivery only when 1&#8208;liposomes were incubated with hydrogen peroxide. Our results showcase that lipid 1 exhibits strong potential as an ROS&#8208;responsive liposomal platform for targeted drug delivery applications.

         <title>Tailoring the NIR&#8208;II Photoluminescence of Single Thiolated Au25 Nanoclusters by Selective Binding to Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanocluster in a jewel case: A single, atomically precise gold nanocluster (Au25) has been incorporated inside bovine serum albumin protein. A striking increase in Au25&#8208;BSA NIR&#8208;II photoluminescence was observed as compared to Au25. The results reveal the intricate role of protein rigidification and the involvement of different excited states in the generation of NIR&#8208;II emissions. More information can be found in the Research Article by V. Bona&#269;i&#263;&#8208;Kouteck&#253;, X. Le&#8197;Gu&#233;vel, R. Antoine, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200570).

         <title>Modeling Heme Peroxidase: Heme Saddling Facilitates Reactions with Hyperperoxides to Form High&#8208;Valent Fe(IV)&#8211;Oxo Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Saddle&#8208;shaped hemes have been discovered in the structures of most peroxidases, and how such macrocycle deformation affects the reaction of Fe(III) hemes with hydrogen peroxide (H  2  O  2  ) to form high&#8208;valent Fe&#8211;oxo species remains uncertain. We investigated the reactions of two Fe(III) porphyrins with different degrees of saddling deformation, namely Fe III (OETPP)ClO  4  (  1  OE  ) and Fe III (OMTPP)ClO  4  (  1  OM  ), with tert &#8208;butyl hydroperoxide (  t&#8208;  BuOOH) in CH 2 Cl 2 at &#8722;40 &#176;C, which quickly resulted in O&#8211;O bond homolysis from a highly unstable Fe(III)&#8211;alkylperoxo intermediate, Fe III&#8211;O(H)OR (  2  ) into Fe(IV)&#8211;oxo porphyrins (  3  ) through examination of the ESI&#8208;MS spectra, absorption changes and 1 H NMR chemical shifts. Insight into the reaction mechanism was obtained from [  t  &#8208;BuOOH]&#8208;dependent kinetics. At &#8722;40 &#176;C, the reaction of  1  OE  with t &#8208;BuOOH exhibited an equilibrium constant ( K  a  = 362.3 M  &#8722;1  ) and rate constant ( k = 1.87 &#215; 10  &#8722;2  s  &#8722;1  ) for the homolytic cleavage of the  2  O&#8211;O bond that were 2.1 and 1.4 times, respectively, those exhibited by 1 OM ( K  a  =171.8 M  &#8722;1  and k = 1.36 &#215; 10  &#8722;2  s  &#8722;1  ). DFT calculations indicated that an Fe(III) porphyrin with greater saddling deformation can achieve a higher HOMO ([Fe(d  z2  ,d  x2&#8211;y2  )&#8211;porphyrin(a  2u  )]) to strengthen the orbital interaction with the LUMO (O&#8211;O bond &#963;*) to facilitate O&#8211;O cleavage.</dc:description>

We investigated the reactions of two Fe(III) porphyrins with different degrees of saddling deformation, namely Fe III (OETPP)ClO  4  (  1  OE  ) and Fe III (OMTPP)ClO  4  (  1  OM  ), with tert -butyl hydroperoxide (  t-  BuOOH) in CH 2 Cl 2 at &#8722;40 &#176;C, which quickly resulted in O&#8211;O bond homolysis from a highly unstable Fe(III)&#8211;alkylperoxo intermediate, Fe III&#8211;O(H)OR (  2  ) into Fe(IV)&#8211;oxo porphyrins (  3  ) through examination of the ESI-MS spectra, absorption changes and 1 H NMR chemical shifts.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Synthesized Cd&#8208;Doped Cs3Cu2I5: Stable and Excitation&#8208;Wavelength Dependent Dual&#8208;Color Emission for Advanced Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cd&#8208;doped Cs3Cu2I5 was synthesized by room&#8208;temperature grinding. [CuI4] and [CdI4] tetrahedrons act as photoluminescent centers separately, resulting in the emission colour manipulated by not only Cd feeding amount but also excitation wavelength. The as&#8208;prepared Cd&#8208;doped Cs3Cu2I5 was made into anti&#8208;counterfeiting ink and printed on paper. The pattern shows different colours when the excitation wavelength increases from 310&#8197;nm to 330&#8197;nm.







Abstract
With the development of intellectual properties, concern about advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting is accumulating, which conventional single&#8208;modal luminescence can no longer satisfy. As one of rapidly developing 0D materials, copper&#8208;based perovskite shows great potential to realize multiple luminescent centers for complex emissions. In this work, Cd was doped into Cs3Cu2I5 and showed resultant emission at 560&#8197;nm which surprisingly showed a red&#8208;shifted excitation peak from that of intrinsic self&#8208;trapped emission, resulting in excitation&#8208;wavelength dependent emission. When the excitation wavelength increased from 290&#8197;nm to 330&#8197;nm, the emission of Cd&#8208;doped Cs3Cu2I5 changed from deep blue to cold white and finally yellow. Afterwards, Cd&#8208;doped Cs3Cu2I5 was mixed with polystyrene to prepare anti&#8208;counterfeiting ink for silk&#8208;screen printing. Meanwhile, Cd&#8208;doped Cs3Cu2I5 maintains outstanding stability after doping, no matter under ambient, continuous UV radiation or high&#8208;temperature environment. The intensity can be almost totally recovered after heating&#8208;and&#8208;cooling cycles. This study lays groundwork for future research into multiple luminescent center manipulation in 0D materials.

         <title>Biomimetic Synthesis of Nor&#8208;Cedrene and Nor&#8208;Isozizaene Sesquiterpenoids and Exploration of Their Olfactive Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical synthesis of isozizaene&#8208; and cedrene&#8208;type nor&#8208;sesquiterpenoids from a simple bio&#8208;inspired precursor nor&#8208;bisabolyl epoxide is described. This key intermediate undergoes selective cyclization cascades without the need for enzymatic control. By choosing cationic or radical cyclization conditions, each sesquiterpene scaffold could be prepared selectively and led to the discovery of new woody odorants of perfumery interest.







Abstract
We report the preparation of nor&#8208;bisabolyl epoxide 13 and its use as a common biomimetic intermediate for the synthesis of nor&#8208;sesquiterpenoids. Through a cationic cyclization cascade pathway, we prepared nor&#8208;isozizaenol 25, ultimately constituting an eight&#8208;step access to this complex sesquiterpenoid from inexpensive and abundant starting materials. Using a radical cyclization cascade pathway, we prepared nor&#8208;cedryl alcohol 26 from the same intermediate. Derivatization of these two products led to the discovery of two potent woody odorants of interest in perfumery.

         <title>Different Enzyme Conformations Induce Different Mechanistic Traits in HIV&#8208;1 Protease</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Convergence and divergence: Using multiple conformations (previously characterized by adiabatic methods) and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics molecular dynamics simulations, we assessed the convergence of activation free energies and the mechanistic divergence of the first step in the reaction catalysed by HIV&#8208;1 protease. The mechanistic divergence for this step was still present and our barriers spanned a range of 5&#8197;kcal&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1.







Abstract
The influence of the dynamical flexibility of enzymes on reaction mechanisms is a cornerstone in biological sciences. In this study, we aim to 1)&#8197;study the convergence of the activation free energy by using the first step of the reaction catalysed by HIV&#8208;1 protease as a case study, and 2)&#8197;provide further evidence for a mechanistic divergence in this enzyme, as two different reaction pathways were seen to contribute to this step. We used quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics molecular dynamics simulations, on four different initial conformations that led to different barriers in a previous study. Despite the sampling, the four activation free energies still spanned a range of 5.0&#8197;kcal&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1. Furthermore, the new simulations did confirm the occurrence of an unusual mechanistic divergence, with two different mechanistic pathways displaying equivalent barriers. An active&#8208;site water molecule is proposed to influence the mechanistic pathway.

         <title>Triplet&#8208;triplet Annihilation Dynamics of Naphthalene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA)&#8208;based photon upconversion involves the fusion of two non&#8208;emissive triplet excited states into one singlet excited state. The TTA process in naphthalene is found to be mediated by conical intersection between the T1T1 and S1S0 states. The coupling of an optical cavity to a naphthalene dimer results in an increase in the efficiency of TTA&#8208;assisted photon upconversion process. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Gudem and M. Kowalewski (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200781).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA)-based&lt;/b&gt; photon upconversion involves the fusion of two non-emissive triplet excited states into one singlet excited state. The TTA process in naphthalene is found to be mediated by conical intersection between the T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; states. The coupling of an optical cavity to a naphthalene dimer results in an increase in the efficiency of TTA-assisted photon upconversion process.

         <title>Bioinspired Photocatalytic NADH Regeneration by Covalently Metalated Carbon Nitride for Enhanced CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural photosynthesis is a highly unified biocatalytic system, which coupled cofactor (NAD(P)H) regeneration and enzymatic CO  2  reduction efficiently for solar energy conversion. Mimicking nature, a novel system with Rh complex covalently grafted onto NH  2  &#8208;functionalized polymeric carbon nitride (NH  2  &#8208;PCN) was constructed. The integrated connection of the light&#8208;harvesting and electron mediation modules as Rh  m3  &#8208;N&#8208;PCN could promote the efficient NAD  +  reduction to NADH. As a result, the integrated system exhibited a conversion of ~66% within 20 minutes. By further coupling in&#8208;situ generated NADH with formate&#160;dehydrogenase (FDH), a photoenzymatic production of formic acid (HCOOH) from CO  2  was accomplished. Moreover, by immobilizing FDH onto a hydrophobic membrane, an enhanced HCOOH production of ~5.0 mM can be obtained due to the concentrated CO  2  on the gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid three&#8208;phase interface. Our work herein provides an integrated strategy for coupling the anchored electron mediator with immobilized enzyme for enhanced artificial photosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Between two chairs: Combination of theory and experiment for the determination of the conformational dynamics of xylosides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The conformational properties of monosaccharides constitute fundamental features of oligosaccharides. While the energy landscape of monosaccharides can be altered by a specific biochemical environment or by chemical modifications, the analysis of resulting dynamic conformational equilibria is not feasible by experimental means alone. In this work, a series of &#946;&#8208;  d  &#8208;xylopyranosides is used to outline how a combination of experimental NMR parameters and computed molecular properties can be used to determine conformers and quantify the composition of conformational equilibria. We demonstrate that identifying the most stable conformers using energy calculations is challenging and computing of NMR shieldings is typically not sensitive enough. On the other hand, computed spin&#8208;spin coupling constants for the xyloside ring can be used to unambiguously assign experimental NMR data of dynamic conformational equilibria and quantify the ratio of different conformers in the mixture. As a proof of principle, this procedure allowed to analyze a hitherto unknown dynamic equilibrium of a diamino&#8208;xyloside as a precursor of a molecular switch.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantification of the Electrophilicities of Diazoalkanes: Kinetics and Mechanism of Azo Couplings with Enamines and Sulfonium Ylides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Kinetics and mechanism of the reactions of methyl diazoacetate, dimethyl diazomalonate, 4&#8208;nitrophenyldiazo&#173;methane, and diphenyldiazomethane with sulfonium ylides and enamines were investigated by UV&#8208;Vis and NMR spectroscopy. Ordinary alkenes undergo 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions with these diazo compounds. In contrast, sulfonium ylides and enamines attack at the terminal nitrogen of the diazo alkanes to give zwitterions, which undergo various subsequent reactions. As only one new bond is formed in the rate&#8208;determining step of these reactions, the correlation lg  k  2  (20 &#176;C) =  s  N  (  N  +  E  ) could be used to determine the one&#8208;bond electrophilicities  E  of the diazo compounds from the measured second&#8208;order rate constants and the known reactivity indices  N  and  s  N  of the sulfonium ylides and enamines. The resulting electrophilicity parameters (&#8211;21 &lt;  E  &lt; &#8232;&#8211;18), which are 11&#8211;14 orders of magnitude smaller than that of the benzenediazonium ion, are used to define the scope of one&#8208;bond nucleophiles which may react with these diazoalkanes.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton Conduction at High Temperature in High&#8208;Symmetry
Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Molecular Crystal of Ru(III) Complexes with Six
Imidazole&#8211;Imidazolate Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new H&#8208;bonded crystal [Ru III (Him) 3 (Im) 3 ] with three
imidazole (Him) and three imidazolate (Im &#8211; ) groups was prepared to
obtain a high&#8208;temperature proton conductor. The crystal is
constructed by complementary N&#8208;H&#8230;N H&#8208;bonds between the Ru III
complexes and has a rare Icy&#8208;c* cubic topology&#8208;net with a two&#8208;fold
interpenetration without crystal anisotropy. The crystals show a proton
conductivity of 3.08 &#197;~ 10 &#8211;5 S/cm at 450 K and faster conductivity than
those formed by only HIm groups. The high proton conductivity is
attributed to not only molecular rotations and hopping motions of HIm
frameworks that are activated at ~113 K, but also isotropic wholemolecule
rotation of [Ru III (Him) 3 (Im) 3 ] at temperatures greater than
420 K. The latter rotation was confirmed by solid&#8208;state 2 H&#8208;NMR
spectroscopy; probable proton conduction routes were predicted and
theoretically considered.</dc:description>

         <title>Suppression of Liquid&#8208;Liquid Phase Separation and Aggregation of Antibodies by Modest Pressure Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High colloidal stability of antibody (immunoglobulin) solutions is important for pharmaceutical applications. Inert cosolutes, excipients, are generally used in therapeutic protein formulations to minimize physical instabilities, such as liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS), aggregation and precipitation, which are often encountered during manufacturing and storage. Despite their widespread use, a detailed understanding of how excipients modulate specific protein&#8722;protein interactions responsible for these instabilities is still lacking. In this work, we demonstrate high pressure&#8208;sensitivity of globulin condensates as a suitable means to suppress LLPS and subsequent aggregation of concentrated antibody solutions. The addition of excipients has a minor effect, only. The high pressure&#8208;sensitivity observed is due to the fact that these flexible Y&#8208;shaped molecules create a considerable amount of void volume in the condensed phase, leading to an overall decrease of the volume of the system upon dissociation of the droplet phase by pressure already at a few ten to hundred bar. Moreover, we show that immunoglobulin molecules themselves are highly pressure resistant against unfolding and can even sustain pressures up to about 6 kbar without conformational changes. This implies that immunoglobulins are resistant to pressure treatment of foods, such as milk, in high&#8208;pressure food processing technologies, thereby preserving their immunological activity.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;High colloidal stability of antibody (immunoglobulin) solutions is important for pharmaceutical applications. Inert cosolutes, excipients, are generally used in therapeutic protein formulations to minimize physical instabilities, such as liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), aggregation and precipitation, which are often encountered during manufacturing and storage. Despite their widespread use, a detailed understanding of how excipients modulate specific protein&#8722;protein interactions responsible for these instabilities is still lacking. In this work, we demonstrate high pressure-sensitivity of globulin condensates as a suitable means to suppress LLPS and subsequent aggregation of concentrated antibody solutions.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;based materials as lithium hosts for lithium batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium (Li) metal has attracted significant attention in areas that range from basic research to various commercial applications due to its high theoretical specific capacity (3860 mA h g&#8722;1  ) and low electrochemical potential (&#8722;3.04 vs. standard hydrogen electrode). However, dendrites often form on the surfaces of Li metal anodes during cycling and thus lead to battery failure and, in some cases, raise safety concerns. To overcome this problem, a variety of approaches that vary the electrolyte, membrane, and/or anode have been proposed. Among these efforts, the use of three&#8208;dimensional frameworks as Li hosts, which can homogenize and minimize the current density at the anode surface, is an effective approach to suppress the formation of Li dendrites. Herein, we describe the development of using carbon&#8208;based materials as Li hosts. While these materials can be fabricated with a variety of porous structures, they have a number of intrinsic advantages including low cost, a high specific surface area, high electrical conductivity, wide electrochemical stability. After briefly summarizing the Li dendrites formation mechanisms, various methods for controlling structural and surface chemistry will be described for different types of carbon&#8208;based materials from the viewpoint of improving their performance as Li hosts. Finally, we provide perspective on the future development of Li host materials needed to meet the requirements for their use in flexible and wearable devices and other contemporary energy storage techniques.</dc:description>

Several advances involving the identification of the actual active sites and intermediates capture on the catalytic surface were summarized, while the morphology and valence states change on 2D materials are specifically chose to illustrate how structural evolution affect catalytic activity.







Abstract
Water&#8208;splitting has emerged as a promising alternative strategy to produce clean hydrogen fuel. However, current electrocatalytic water splitting suffers from sluggish kinetics, thus developing efficient electrocatalysts is crucial. Identifying reaction centers discloses the reaction mechanism and will undoubtedly facilitate the design and optimization of efficient water splitting electrocatalysts. This review summarizes several advances involving the identification of the actual active sites and intermediates capture on the catalytic surface. The morphology and valence states change on 2D materials are chose to illustrate how structural evolution affect catalytic activity. Specifically, in&#8197;situ/ex situ electron microscopy techniques that used for the characterization of catalytic sites, and spectroscopy techniques that used to detect active intermediates at the molecular level are highlighted. In addition, several perspectives, such as the development of new in&#8197;situ techniques and electrokinetic analysis methods, are emphasized to shed light on future research.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent and Supramolecular Polymers: From Monolayer to Bilayer and the Thicker</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 36, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlled growth of 2D polymer layers: With the synthetic strategies of monolayer 2D covalent and supramolecular polymers being available, synthetic chemistry for bilayer 2D polymers has emerged, which holds promises for attaining well&#8208;defined, few&#8208;layer 2D polymers. The advances will lead to a bridge to transform 2D materials to 3D materials in a controllable manner.







Abstract
Selective preparation of two&#8208;dimensional polymers (2DPs) and supramolecular polymers (2DSPs) with defined thickness is crucially important for controlling and maximizing their functions, yet it has remained as a synthetic challenge. In the past decade, several approaches have been developed to allow selective preparation of discrete monolayer 2DPs and 2DSPs. Recently, crystal exfoliation and self&#8208;assembly strategies have been employed to successfully prepare bilayer 2DP and 2DSP, which represent the first step towards the controlled &#8220;growth&#8221; of 2D polymers from the thinnest monolayers to thicker few&#8208;layers along the third dimension. This Concept review discusses the concept of accurate synthesis of 2D polymers with defined layers. Advances in this research area will pave the way to rational synthetic strategies for 2D polymers with controlled thickness.

         <title>Identifying the Molecular Origins of Green BN&#8208;TADF Material Degradation and Device Stability via in&#8197;situ Raman Spectroscopy</title>

         <dc:description>
Terminal substituents and conformational changes have a great impact on OLED device efficiency and stability investigated by in&#8197;situ Raman spectroscopy. Compared to BN&#8208;PhOH with the lowest EQEmax of 19.0&#8201;% and LT50 of 1.7&#8197;h, BN&#8208;PhN(CH3)2 exhibited the longest OLED device lifetime (7.7&#8197;h), enhanced EQEmax of 24.1&#8201;%, and alleviated efficiency roll&#8208;off, as a manifestation of less conformational changes.







Abstract
There is little investigation into the impact of molecular conformation on device efficiency and degradation of boron&#8208;nitrogen thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters (BN&#8208;TADF). Herein, three highly&#8208;efficient green BN&#8208;TADF emitters have been designed to unveil the impact of peripheral phenyl groups on device efficiencies and lifetimes. Compared to BN&#8208;PhOH with the lowest EQEmax of 19&#8201;%, BN&#8208;PhOCH3 and BN&#8208;PhN(CH3)2 have achieved strongly enhanced EQEmax of 25.6&#8201;% and 24.1&#8201;%, respectively. Importantly, the device lifetimes (LT50) are dramatically improved from 1.7&#8197;h of BN&#8208;PhOH to 4.4&#8197;h of BN&#8208;PhOCH3 and 7.7&#8197;h of BN&#8208;PhN(CH3)2 without encapsulation. According to in&#8197;situ Raman spectroscopy and simulations, BN&#8208;PhN(CH3)2 of less conformation change after aging exhibits the best photostability. It is proposed that the torsion angle change between the BN core and the peripheral phenyl group results in BN&#8208;TADF degradation. This knowledge means precisely tuning peripheral groups of BN&#8208;TADF can achieve both higher device efficiencies and longer lifetimes.

         <title>Green&#8208;Light Activatable BODIPY and Coumarin 5&#8217;&#8208;Caps for Oligonucleotide Photocaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 36, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Green&#8208;light absorbing BODIPY and coumarin derivatives can be used as phosphoramidites in oligonucleotide synthesis. CuAAC reactions allow cyclization and therefore fast photocaging or the introduction of other photolabile modification at those 5&#8217;&#8208;caps. Both caps are readily photocleaved within the green gap (530 and 565&#8197;nm), hence they avoid UV damage and offer deeper tissue penetration, especially in plants.







Abstract
We synthesized two green&#8208;light activatable 5&#8217;&#8208;caps for oligonucleotides based on the BODIPY and coumarin scaffold. Both bear an alkyne functionality allowing their use in numerous biological applications. They were successfully incorporated in oligonucleotides via solid&#8208;phase synthesis. Copper&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) using a bisazide photo&#8208;tether gave cyclic oligonucleotides that could be relinearized by activation with green light and were shown to exhibit high stability against exonucleases. Chemical ligation as another example for bioconjugation yielded oligonucleotides with an internal strand break site. Irradiation at 530&#8197;nm or 565&#8197;nm resulted in complete photolysis of both caging groups.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Green-light absorbing BODIPY&lt;/b&gt; and coumarin derivatives can be used as phosphoramidites in oligonucleotide synthesis. CuAAC reactions allow cyclization and therefore fast photocaging or the introduction of other photolabile modification at those 5&#8217;-caps. Both caps are readily photocleaved within the green gap (530 and 565&#8197;nm), hence they avoid UV damage and offer deeper tissue penetration, especially in plants.

         <title>GNPS&#8208;Guided Discovery of Madurastatin Siderophores from the Termite&#8208;Associated Actinomadura sp. RB99

Metabolomic analysis of cocultures of Actinomadura sp. RB99 with fungal symbionts of termites allowed for the MS&#8208;guided isolation of four unreported madurastatin derivatives, including a siderophore&#8208;metal complex thereof.







Abstract
In this study, we analyzed if Actinomadura sp. RB99 produces siderophores that that could be responsible for the antimicrobial activity observed in co&#8208;cultivation studies. Dereplication of high&#8208;resolution tandem mass spectrometry (HRMS/MS) and global natural product social molecular networking platform (GNPS) analysis of fungus&#8208;bacterium co&#8208;cultures resulted in the identification of five madurastatin derivatives (A1, A2, E1, F, and G1), of which were four new derivatives. Chemical structures were unambiguously confirmed by HR&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS, 1D and 2D NMR experiments, as well as MS/MS data and their absolute structures were elucidated based on Marfey's analysis, DP4+ probability calculation and total synthesis. Structure analysis revealed that madurastatin E1 (2) contained a rare 4&#8208;imidazolidinone cyclic moiety and madurastatin A1 (5) was characterized as a Ga3+&#8208;complex. The function of madurastatins as siderophores was evaluated using the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans as model organism. Based on homology models, we identified the putative NRPS&#8208;based gene cluster region of the siderophores in Actinomadura sp. RB99.

         <title>A Composite of Two Dimensional GeSe2/Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Reduced Graphene Oxide for Enhanced Capacitive Lithium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 36, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composite of 2D GeSe2/N&#8208;rGO is fabricated via a simple hydrothermal method combined with post&#8208;selenization process, and shows superb rate capability and excellent cycling stability. The electrochemical reaction mechanism is also revealed by the in situ XRD, indicating that the conversion reaction has played a certain part in Li+ storage.







Abstract
A composite of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) GeSe2 nanosheets dispersed on N&#8208;doped reduced graphene oxide (GeSe2/N&#8208;rGO) is fabricated via a simple hydrothermal method combined with post&#8208;selenization process. The high electronic conductivity and the substantial void spaces of the wrinkled N&#8208;rGO can improve the electrical conductivity of the active material and accommodate the volume evolution of GeSe2 nanosheets during the (de)lithiation processes, while GeSe2 nanosheets can reduce ion diffusion length effectively. Meanwhile, the unique layered structure is beneficial to the contact of the active material and electrolyte, and the reversibility of conversion reaction has also been improved. Furthermore, kinetics analysis reveals a pseudocapacitance&#8208;dominated Li+&#8208;storage mechanism at high rates. In&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis discloses that the conversion reaction has played a certain part in Li+&#8208;storage. Thus, the GeSe2/N&#8208;rGO composite delivers excellent rate capability and good long&#8208;term stability with a high reversible capacity of 711.0&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 2000 cycles at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.

Abstract
The oxonitridosilicate La7Sr[Si10N19O3]&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+ and its substitutional variants RE8&#8208;xAEx[Si10N20&#8208;xO2+x]&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+ with RE=La, Ce; AE=Ca, Sr, Ba and 0&#8804;x&#8804;2 were synthesized starting from REN, SrN/Ca3N2/Ba2N, SiO2, amorphous Si3N4 and Eu2O3 as doping agent at 1600&#8201;&#176;C in a radiofrequency furnace. The crystal structure of La7Sr[Si10N19O3] was solved and refined based on single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data. La7Sr[Si10N19O3] crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pmn21 (no. 31). The crystal structures of the isotypic compounds RE8&#8208;xAEx[Si10N20&#8208;xO2+x] were confirmed by Rietveld refinements based on powder X&#8208;ray diffraction data using the single&#8208;crystal data of La7Sr[Si10N19O3] as starting point. Crystal structure elucidation reveals a 3D network of vertex sharing SiN4 and SiN2(N1/2&#8208;x/4O1/2+x/4)2 (0&#8804;x&#8804;2) tetrahedra. When excited with UV to blue light, La7Sr[Si10N19O3]&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+ shows amber luminescence with &#955;em=612&#8197;nm and fwhm=84&#8197;nm/2194&#8197;cm&#8722;1, which makes it interesting for application in amber phosphor&#8208;converted light emitting diodes.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Promoted RhI&#8208;Catalyzed C2&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Alkenylation and Polyenylation of Imidazoles with Alkenyl Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 36, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A RhI&#8208;catalyzed C2&#8722;H alkenylation of imidazoles with alkenyl carboxylic acids with highly regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity is reported. This protocol merges C&#8722;H bond functionalization and the decarbonylation of carboxylic acids, accommodates a wide range of substrates with good compatibility of functional groups, and can be easily scaled.







Abstract
The first RhI&#8208;catalyzed, directed decarbonylative C2&#8722;H alkenylation of imidazoles with readily available alkenyl carboxylic acids is reported. The reaction proceeds in a highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective manner, providing efficient access to C2&#8208;alkenylated imidazoles that are generally inaccessible by known C&#8722;H alkenylation methods. This transformation accommodates a wide range of alkenyl carboxylic acids, including challenging conjugated polyene carboxylic acids, and diversely decorated imidazoles with high functional group compatibility. The presence of a removable pyrimidine directing group and the use of a bidentate phosphine ligand are pivotal to the success of the catalytic reaction. This process is also suitable for benzimidazoles. Importantly, the scalability and diversification of the products highlight the potential of this protocol in practical applications. Detailed experimental and computational studies provide important insights into the underlying reaction mechanism.

         <title>Peroxynitrite&#8208;Promoted Persulfide Prodrugs with Protective Potential against Paracetamol Poisoning</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 36, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of novel persulfide prodrugs was designed and synthesized, which scavenged peroxynitrite in tandem during their activation. The 2&#8208;oxo&#8208;2&#8208;phenylacetamide triggers can first react with peroxynitrite and then initiate the release of persulfides, a second quencher of peroxynitrite. The prodrug intervention significantly reduced the intracellular concentration of APAP&#8208;induced peroxynitrite in HepG2 and alleviated the oxidative stress of H9c2 cardiac cells.







Abstract
The newly emerging persulfide prodrugs provide additional options for the profound study of persulfide, a fascinating molecule expected to intervene in biological functions and even diseases. Peroxynitrite is often the culprit in pathological processes characterized by oxidative stress, while the persulfide prodrug responsive to it is still pending. To enrich the family of redox&#8208;activated prodrugs, we designed prodrugs with a 2&#8208;oxo&#8208;2&#8208;phenylacetamide trigger, which achieved the release of persulfide via 1, 6&#8208;N, S&#8208;relay. The degradation of prodrugs and the formation of persulfides were confirmed to be peroxynitrite&#8208;responsible by the qualitative and quantitative studies based on LC&#8208;MS/MS methods and a spectrophotometry&#8208;based tag&#8208;switch strategy. Furthermore, these prodrugs showed potent peroxynitrite scavenging activity, cellular therapeutic potential against paracetamol poisoning in HepG2 and oxidative stress in H9c2, as well as desirable in vitro metabolic properties.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Reductive Amination of Ketones and Secondary Amines: Breaking the Aliphatic Wall</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 36, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The elusive direct reductive amination between aliphatic amines and aliphatic ketones is reported. This was achieved by using a diphosphine&#8208;coordinated iridium catalyst. The applicability and functional&#8208;group tolerance were demonstrated by the synthesis of a panel of tertiary amines relevant for medicinal chemistry research. This methodology is promising for implementation in late&#8208;stage functionalization and repurposing current retrosynthetic schemes.







Abstract
Direct reductive amination (DRA) is a ubiquitous reaction in organic chemistry. This transformation between a carbonyl group and an amine is most often achieved by using a super stoichiometric amount of hazardous hydride reagents, thus being incompatible with many sensitive functional groups. DRA could also be achieved by means of chemo&#8208; or biocatalysis, thereby attracting the interest of industry as well as academic laboratories due to the virtually perfect atom economy. Although DRAs are well&#8208;established for substrate pairs such as aldehydes with either 1&#176; or 2&#176; amines as well as ketones with 1&#176; amines, the current methodologies are limited in the case of ketones with 2&#176; amines. Herein, we present a general DRA protocol that overcomes this major limitation by means of iridium catalysis. The applicability of the methodology is demonstrated by accessing an unprecedented range of biologically relevant tertiary amines starting from both aliphatic ketones and aliphatic amines. The choice of a disphosphane ligand (Josiphos A or Xantphos) is essential for the success of the transformation.

         <title>Interfacial Charge Modulation via in situ Fabrication of 3D Conductive Platform with MOF Nanoparticles for Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 36, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photocatalyst was designed for CO2 reduction by assembling 3D GR with UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, aiming to construct a built&#8208;in electric field for charge separation. The composites show enhanced photocatalytic activity owing to improved distribution and exposure of absorption and reaction sites and redistribution of photogenerated carriers between 3D GR and UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2.







Abstract
Highly&#8208;efficient photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into valuable carbon&#8208;contained chemicals possesses a tremendous potential in solving the energy crisis and global warming problem. However, the inadequate separation of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs and the unsatisfied capture of CO2 stay the chief roadblocks. Herein, we designed a novel photocatalyst for CO2 reduction by assembling three&#8208;dimensional graphene (3D GR) with a typical metal&#8208;organic framework material UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, aiming to construct a built&#8208;in electric field for charge separation as well as taking advantage of the typical 3D structure of GR for maximizing the exposed absorption site on the surface. The performance evaluation demonstrated that the photocatalytic activity has been improved for the composite materials compared with that of the pure UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2. Further mechanism investigations proved that the enhanced photocatalytic performance is attributed to the synergy of enhanced CO2 absorption and inhibited photogenerated charge recombination, which could be owing to the better distribution and exposure of absorption and reaction sites on composites, and the redistribution of photogenerated carriers between 3D GR and UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2. This study provides a promising pathway to probe nanocomposites based on MOFs in environmental improvement and other relevant fields.

         <title>Dynamic Amino Acid Side&#8208;Chains Grafting on Folded Peptide Backbone
</title>

         <dc:description>
An efficient access to large libraries of conformationally defined peptides is reported, using dynamic combinatorial chemistry as a tool to graft amino acid's side&#8208;chains in defined arrangement on a well&#8208;ordered 3D peptide scaffold. We report here the design of a chemical system that ensures the scrambling of side&#8208;chains on a pre&#8208;organized scaffold leading to an isoenergetic library useful for ligand screening.







Abstract
An efficient strategy for the synthesis of large libraries of conformationally defined peptides is reported, using dynamic combinatorial chemistry as a tool to graft amino acid side chains on a well&#8208;ordered 3D (3&#8208;dimension) peptide backbone. Combining rationally designed scaffolds with combinatorial side chains selection represents an alternative method to access peptide libraries for structures that are not genetically encodable. This method would allow a breakthrough for the discovery of protein mimetic for unconventional targets for which little is known.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Modification of Aminoglycoside Antibiotics Overcomes Bacterial Resistance Mediated by APH(3&#8217;) Kinases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 36, June 27, 2022. </description>

Regioselective oxidation: A scalable catalytic alcohol oxidation of structurally complex 4,5&#8208; and 4,6&#8208;disubstituted aminoglycoside antibiotics is reported. Exploiting a palladium catalyst, this late&#8208;stage modification is extremely selective tackling only the hydroxyl group in 3&#8242;&#8208;position. Subsequent modification of the resulting ketone derivatives enables facile access to novel antibiotic candidates, in only four synthetic steps, which overcome bacterial resistance mediated by APH(3&#8217;)s.







Abstract
The continuous emergence of antimicrobial resistance is causing a threat to patients infected by multidrug&#8208;resistant pathogens. In particular, the clinical use of aminoglycoside antibiotics, broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterials of last resort, is limited due to rising bacterial resistance. One of the major resistance mechanisms in Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria is phosphorylation of these amino sugars at the 3&#8217;&#8208;position by O&#8208;phosphotransferases [APH(3&#8217;)s]. Structural alteration of these antibiotics at the 3&#8217;&#8208;position would be an obvious strategy to tackle this resistance mechanism. However, the access to such derivatives requires cumbersome multi&#8208;step synthesis, which is not appealing for pharma industry in this low&#8208;return&#8208;on&#8208;investment market. To overcome this obstacle and combat bacterial resistance mediated by APH(3&#8217;)s, we introduce a novel regioselective modification of aminoglycosides in the 3&#8217;&#8208;position via palladium&#8208;catalyzed oxidation. To underline the effectiveness of our method for structural modification of aminoglycosides, we have developed two novel antibiotic candidates overcoming APH(3&#8217;)s&#8208;mediated resistance employing only four synthetic steps.

         <title>Tuning the Properties of 5&#8208;Azido and 5&#8208;Nitramino&#8208;tetrazoles by Diverse Functionalization &#8211; General Concepts for Future Energetic Materials</title>

Derivatization of 5&#8208;azido and 5&#8208;nitraminotetrazole with an azidoethyl, nitratoethyl or methyl group gives access to less acidic high explosives with versatile properties. Salt formation of the nitraminotetrazoles with nitrogen&#8208;rich and metal cations was performed to achieve less acidity, lower vapor pressure and higher thermal stability. The modification of the nitramino and azidotetrazole backbones show and nice way to tune the compounds&#8217; properties and are valuable for the design of future energetic materials.







Abstract
5&#8208;Azido and 5&#8208;nitraminotetrazole backbones are established heterocyclic motifs in the research field of energetic materials synthesis. Despite the high energy content of the compounds, the problem with many derivatives is that their sensitivities are far too high. Functionalization of one of the ring nitrogen atoms is the aim of this study to adjust the sensitivity by inserting nitratoethyl, azidoethyl and methyl groups. In this context, derivatives of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;azidoethyl)&#8208;5&#8208;nitraminotetrazoles (2, 2&#8201;a&#8211;2&#8201;d), as well as 1&#8208;nitrato and 1&#8208;azidoethyl substituted 5&#8208;azidotetrazole (7 and 10) and the methylation products of 5&#8208;azidotetrazole (5&#8208;azido&#8208;1&#8208;methyl&#8208;tetrazole, 11 and 5&#8208;azido&#8208;2&#8208;methyl&#8208;tetrazole, 12) were prepared. The obtained nitrogen&#8208;rich compounds were extensively characterized through multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and IR spectroscopy. The structural confinement was checked by X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments. The pure samples (verified by elemental analysis) were investigated regarding their behavior toward friction, impact (BAM methods) and electrostatic discharge as well as heating (DTA and DSC). For all metal&#8208;free compounds the detonation properties were computed with the EXPLO5 code using their density and heat of formation, calculated based on CBS&#8208;4&#8197;M level of theory.

Revealing a radical route: The radical reactivity of the biradical [&#8901;P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)2&#7766;] has been investigated. It was possible to synthesize the persistent phosphorus&#8208;centered monoradical [&#8901;P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)2P&#8722;Et] and identify it as a radical intermediate during the addition of bromoethane to [&#8901;P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)2&#7766;]. A possible stepwise mechanism of this reaction was formulated and is supported by both detailed quantum chemical calculations and experimental results.







Abstract
The activation of C&#8722;Br bonds in various bromoalkanes by the biradical [&#8901;P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)2P&#8901;] (1) (Ter=2,6&#8208;bis&#8208;(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)&#8208;phenyl) is reported, yielding trans&#8208;addition products of the type [Br&#8722;P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)2P&#8722;R] (2), so&#8208;called 1,3&#8208;substituted cyclo&#8208;1,3&#8208;diphospha&#8208;2,4&#8208;diazanes. This addition reaction, which represents a new easy approach to asymmetrically substituted cyclo&#8208;1,3&#8208;diphospha&#8208;2,4&#8208;diazanes, was investigated mechanistically by different spectroscopic methods (NMR, EPR, IR, Raman); the results suggested a stepwise radical reaction mechanism, as evidenced by the in&#8208;situ detection of the phosphorus&#8208;centered monoradical [&#8901;P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)2P&#8208;R].&lt; To provide further evidence for the radical mechanism, [&#8901;P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)2P&#8208;Et] (3Et&#8901;) was synthesized directly by reduction of the bromoethane addition product [Br&#8208;P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)2P&#8208;Et] (2&#8201;a) with magnesium, resulting in the formation of the persistent phosphorus&#8208;centered monoradical [&#8901;P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)2P&#8208;Et], which could be isolated and fully characterized, including single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Comparison of the EPR spectrum of the radical intermediate in the addition reaction with that of the synthesized new [&#8901;P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)2P&#8208;Et] radical clearly proves the existence of radicals over the course of the reaction of biradical [&#8901;P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)2P&#8901;] (1) with bromoethane. Extensive DFT and coupled cluster calculations corroborate the experimental data for a radical mechanism in the reaction of biradical [&#8901;P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)2P&#8901;] with EtBr. In the field of hetero&#8208;cyclobutane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyls, the demonstration of a stepwise radical reaction represents a new aspect and closes the gap between P&#8208;centered biradicals and P&#8208;centered monoradicals in terms of radical reactivity.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Installation of Dehydroamino Acid Motifs into Peptides Enabled by an N&#8208;Chloropeptide Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 36, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report and demonstrate the practical utility of an N&#8208;chloropeptide strategy for the rapid construction of &#916;AA&#8208;containing peptides. The quinuclidine (ABCO)&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;chlorination of peptide bonds and the subsequent &#946;&#8208;elimination of N&#8208;chloroamide efficiently provides &#916;AA&#8208;containing peptides in high yield. The strategy enables the late&#8208;stage installation of &#916;AA motifs into already&#8208;constructed oligopeptides, including a macrocyclic peptide.







Abstract
Conventional methods for the construction of dehydroamino acids (&#916;AAs), which are a unique class of non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids, require the pre&#8208;installation of special amino acids. Herein, we report and demonstrate the practical utility of an N&#8208;chloropeptide strategy for the rapid construction of &#916;AA&#8208;containing peptides. The electrophilic N&#8208;chlorination of peptide bonds is drastically accelerated by a catalytic amount of quinuclidine (ABCO), and the subsequent &#946;&#8208;elimination of N&#8208;chloroamide efficiently provides &#916;AA&#8208;containing peptides in high yield. The strategy enables, for the first time, the construction of a wide variety of &#916;AA residues in peptides without any pre&#8208;functionalized side chains and facilitates the late&#8208;stage installation of &#916;AA motifs into already&#8208;constructed oligopeptides, including a medicinally important macrocyclic peptide.

A carp (alkyne) swimming up a waterfall falling from a legendary mountain (energy gap that is hard to jump without photoexcitation) accepts a pearl (alkyl radical) prepared by an oyster (Ir photoredox catalyst) under sunlight irradiation and becomes a dragon with a pearl in its mouth (Markovnikov&#8208;type product) or in its claws (anti&#8208;Markovnikov&#8208;type product) after going through different longmen or dragon gates (different Ni catalysts). The comparison is based on a myth popular in East Asian countries. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y. Nishibayashi and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200727).

An iridium&#8208;catalyzed methodology leads to fully aliphatic tertiary amines starting from readily available ketones and amines. This direct reductive amination transformation, fueled by hydrogen similar to a space rocket, enables access to an unprecedented chemical space with a functional group relevance compatible with active pharmaceutical ingredients. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Jouffroy, R. Gramage&#8208;Doria et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201078).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A complex comprising one [Re(CO)3]+  unit and a phthalocyanine (Pc) ligand (Re1Pc) is shown to function as a photo&#8208;induced CO&#8208;releasing molecule (photoCORM) in the presence of O2  and a coordinative solvent under irradiation with red light, which can deeply penetrate living tissues. Transient absorption spectroscopic measurements indicate very short excited&#8208;state lifetimes and ultrafast intersystem crossing for  Re1Pc  and  Re2Pc, which contains two [Re(CO)3]+  units. The excited&#8208;state properties are ascribed to efficient spin&#8208;orbit coupling and large Franck&#8208;Condon factors originating from the complexes&#8217; distorted structures, i.e., unsymmetric coordination of [Re(CO)3]+  unit(s), one of which was confirmed via single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis of a symmetrically&#8208;substituted Pc with two [Re(CO)3]+  units.  Re1Pc  represents a promising red light&#8208;driven photoCORM that can be applied in biological environments or therapeutic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;fidelity recognition of organotrifluoroborate anions (R&#8211;BF&#160;3&#160;&#8211;) as designer guest molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recognition of boron compounds is well developed as boronic acids but untapped as organotrifluoroborate anions (R&#8211;BF  3  &#8211;  ). We are exploring the development of these and other designer anions as anion&#8208;recognition motifs by considering them as substituted versions of the parent inorganic ion. To this end, we demonstrate strong and reliable binding of organic trifluoroborates, R&#8722;BF  3  &#8722;  , by cyanostar macrocycles that are size&#8208;complementary to the inorganic BF  4  &#8211;  &#160;progenitors. We find that recognition is modulated by the substituent&#8217;s sterics and that the affinities are retained using the common K  +  &#160;salts of R&#8211;BF  3  &#8211;  &#160;anions.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;CF3 Imidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;one Derivatives via Photocatalytic and Silver&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclizations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reported methodologies open access to the mono&#8208;substituted N&#8208;CF3 imidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ones at the 4&#8208;position which was previously inaccessible. Directly from the linear N&#8208;CF3 ureas bearing an alkene moiety, N&#8208;CF3 imidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ones were prepared via Ag&#8208;catalysis and light assisted proton coupled electron transfer. Instead of prior modification of the alkene moiety, tandem PCET and Nickel catalysis were shown to increase the diversity of the core. The cyclic compounds were then treated under various conditions to modify the core structure to introduce structural complexity.







Abstract
While the N&#8208;trifluoromethylation of cyclic ureas is of interest for the potential to fundamentally change the properties of these biologically relevant moieties, the single synthetic procedure known to date describing their access only gives 4,4&#8208;disubstituted or fused aromatic cyclic N&#8208;CF3 urea derivatives. We herein report an alternative approach to unleash access to the 4&#8208;monosubstituted imidazolidinone motif. The strategy relies on straightforward cyclization of readily accessible acyclic ureas, enabled by Ag&#8208;catalysis or light&#8208;assisted proton coupled electron transfer. The cyclic core is shown to be highly robust and amenable to various derivatizations, such as tandem Ni&#8208;catalysis, C&#8722;B, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;C cross couplings or C&#8722;H functionalizations, tolerating basic, nucleophilic and/or oxidizing conditions.

         <title>Tuning Deazaflavins Towards Highly Potent Reducing Photocatalysts Guided by Mechanistic Understanding &#8211; Enhancement of the Key Step by the Internal Heavy Atom Effect</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by nature and based on mechanistic understanding, we designed deazaflavins (dFl) with reducing powers comparable to Li which function via the consecutive photo&#8208;induced electron transfer (conPET) mechanism independently on molecular oxygen. The internal heavy atom effect (IHAE) by introducing bromine into the photocatalyst enhances considerably the key triplet pathway via a triplet&#8208;born radical pair. Furthermore, an optimal concentration of the sacrificial electron donor (Ssac) is required for bypassing the unproductive reaction via the singlet&#8208;born radical pair.







Abstract
Deazaflavins are well suited for reductive chemistry acting via a consecutive photo&#8208;induced electron transfer, in which their triplet state and semiquinone &#8211; the latter is formed from the former after electron transfer from a sacrificial electron donor &#8211; are key intermediates. Guided by mechanistic investigations aiming to increase intersystem crossing by the internal heavy atom effect and optimising the concentration conditions to avoid unproductive excited singlet reactions, we synthesised 5&#8208;aryldeazaflavins with Br or Cl substituents on different structural positions via a three&#8208;component reaction. Bromination of the deazaisoalloxazine core leads to almost 100&#8201;% triplet yield but causes photo&#8208;instability and enhances unproductive side reactions. Bromine on the 5&#8208;phenyl group in ortho position does not affect the photostability, increases the triplet yield, and allows its efficient usage in the photocatalytic dehalogenation of bromo&#8208; and chloroarenes with electron&#8208;donating methoxy and alkyl groups even under aerobic conditions. Reductive powers comparable to lithium are achieved.

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by nature and based on mechanistic understanding, we designed deazaflavins (dFl) with reducing powers comparable to Li which function via the consecutive photo-induced electron transfer (&lt;i&gt;con&lt;/i&gt;PET) mechanism independently on molecular oxygen. The internal heavy atom effect (IHAE) by introducing bromine into the photocatalyst enhances considerably the key triplet pathway via a triplet-born radical pair. Furthermore, an optimal concentration of the sacrificial electron donor (S&lt;sub&gt;sac&lt;/sub&gt;) is required for bypassing the unproductive reaction via the singlet-born radical pair.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deazaflavins are well suited for reductive chemistry acting via a consecutive photo-induced electron transfer, in which their triplet state and semiquinone &#8211; the latter is formed from the former after electron transfer from a sacrificial electron donor &#8211; are key intermediates. Guided by mechanistic investigations aiming to increase intersystem crossing by the internal heavy atom effect and optimising the concentration conditions to avoid unproductive excited singlet reactions, we synthesised 5-aryldeazaflavins with Br or Cl substituents on different structural positions via a three-component reaction. Bromination of the deazaisoalloxazine core leads to almost 100&#8201;% triplet yield but causes photo-instability and enhances unproductive side reactions. Bromine on the 5-phenyl group in ortho position does not affect the photostability, increases the triplet yield, and allows its efficient usage in the photocatalytic dehalogenation of bromo- and chloroarenes with electron-donating methoxy and alkyl groups even under aerobic conditions. Reductive powers comparable to lithium are achieved.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulated Synthesis of Self&#8208;Standing Covalent Organic Framework Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modulated strategy was developed for the synthesis of self&#8208;standing COF films with good crystallinity and tunable thickness. As compared with the non&#8208;modulated method, the modulated approach changes the COF morphology from nanoparticles to nanofibers, enabling the facile preparation of self&#8208;standing COF films with improved mechanical properties. The Young's modulus of the self&#8208;standing COF film obtained via the modulated strategy could increase by 26&#8197;times.







Abstract
The weak interaction of covalent organic framework (COF) nanoparticles makes the preparation of self&#8208;standing COF films difficult. Herein, a modulated strategy for the facile synthesis of self&#8208;standing COF films with good crystallinity and tunable thickness is reported. As compared with the non&#8208;modulated approach, the modulated strategy changes the COF morphology from nanoparticles to nanofibers, enabling the facile preparation of self&#8208;standing COF films with improved mechanical properties. The Young's modulus of the self&#8208;standing COF film obtained via the modulated strategy could increase by 26&#8197;times. Moreover, self&#8208;standing LZU&#8208;8 film can be used as a membrane for efficient removal of 99&#8201;% mercury ions from aqueous solution. Our results open up a new approach to prepare self&#8208;standing COF thin films for practical applications.

         <title>A Highly Water&#8208; and Air&#8208;Stable Iron&#8208;Containing MRI Contrast Agent Sensor for H2O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An Fe(II) complex with the macrocyclic quinol&#8208;containing ligand H4qp4 displays high water&#8208; and air&#8208;stability. The complex rapidly reacts with H2O2, but not O2, to yield Fe(III) complexes with oxidized ligands that contain para&#8208;quinone groups. Upon oxidation by H2O2, the r1 increases by over four&#8208;fold, enabling the Fe(II) complex to act as an MRI contrast agent sensor for this reactive oxygen species.







Abstract
A highly water&#8208; and air&#8208;stable Fe(II) complex with the quinol&#8208;containing macrocyclic ligand H4qp4 reacts with H2O2 to yield Fe(III) complexes with less highly chelating forms of the ligand that have either one or two para&#8208;quinones. The reaction increases the T1&#8208;weighted relaxivity over four&#8208;fold, enabling the complex to detect H2O2 using clinical MRI technology. The iron&#8208;containing sensor differs from its recently characterized manganese analog, which also detects H2O2, in that it is the oxidation of the metal center, rather than the ligand, that primarily enhances the relaxivity.

         <title>Ammonia Borane, NH3BH3: A Threshold Photoelectron&#8211;Photoion Coincidence Study of a Potential Hydrogen&#8208;Storage Material</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The threshold photoelectron spectrum of ammonia borane NH3BH3 is reported. We determined an ionization energy of 9.26&#177;0.03&#8197;eV and observed a pronounced vibrational progression. In addition, the dissociation energy of the B&#8722;H bond was determined to be 419&#177;10&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1. The electronic situation of NH3BH3 is compared to its hydrocarbon analogue ethane.







Abstract
We have investigated the photoionization of ammonia borane (AB) and determined adiabatic ionization energy to be 9.26&#177;0.03&#8197;eV for the X+ 2E&#8592;X 1A1 transition. Although the threshold photoelectron spectrum appears at first glance to be similar to the one of the isosteric ethane, the electronic situation differs markedly, due to different orbital energies. In addition, an appearance energy AE0K(NH3BH3, NH3BH2+)= 10.00&#177;0.03&#8197;eV has been determined, corresponding to the loss of a hydrogen atom at the BH3&#8208;site. From the data, a 0&#8197;K bond dissociation energy for the B&#8722;H bond in the cation of 71.5&#177;3&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 was derived, whereas the one in the neutral compound has been estimated to be 419&#177;10&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1.

         <title>Relevance of Palladium to Radiopharmaceutical Development Considering Enhanced Coordination Properties of TE1PA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coordination chemistry of palladium is poorly developed in nuclear medicine due to the lack of appropriate ligands capable of fulfilling all the criteria required for an in&#8197;vivo application. By showing that the monopicolinate cyclam TE1PA is a highly relevant chelator for natural and radioactive Pd, we have opened avenues to enrich the area of palladium&#8208;based targeted radiotherapies. This cover represents the early stage of their expansion. More information can be found in the Research Article by C.&#8197;H.&#8197;S. Driver, N. Le&#8197;Bris, R. Tripier, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200942).

         <title>A High&#8208;Valent Ru&#8208;PCP Pincer Catalyst for Hydrogenation of Carbonyl and Carboxyl Compounds under Molecular Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;valent metal complexes are viable candidates for hydrogenation catalysts: The domain of catalytic hydrogenation is traditionally dominated by low&#8208;valent metals; however, the heterolytic bond&#8208;splitting mechanism does not require an electron&#8208;rich metal. Here we report a structurally well&#8208;defined ruthenium(IV) catalyst capable of hydrogen activation at room temperature and the efficient hydrogenation of carbonyl and carboxyl compounds under molecular hydrogen.

MB&#8208;DIPY&#8208;based stable radicals with redox&#8208;switchable absorption beyond 1000&#8197;nm have been prepared and characterized by spectroscopic and theoretical methods. Stable radical complexes can be either oxidized to regular [MII(MB&#8208;DIPY)]+ (M=Cu or Ni) or reduced to [MII(MB&#8208;DIPY)]&#8722; compounds within an &#8764;400&#8197;mV electrochemical window.







Abstract
The preparation of radicals with intense and redox&#8208;switchable absorption beyond 1000&#8197;nm is a long&#8208;standing challenge in the chemistry of functional dyes. Here we report the preparation of a series of unprecedented stable neutral nickel(II) and copper(II) complexes of &#8220;Manitoba dipyrromethenes&#8221; (MB&#8208;DIPYs) in which the organic chromophore is present in the radical&#8208;anion state. The new stable radicals have an intense absorption at &#955;max&#8764;1300&#8197;nm and can be either oxidized to regular [MII(MB&#8208;DIPY)]+ (M=Cu or Ni) or reduced to [MII(MB&#8208;DIPY)]&#8722; compounds. The radical nature of the stable [MII(MB&#8208;DIPY)] complexes was confirmed by EPR spectroscopy with additional insight into their electronic structure obtained by UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, electro&#8208; and spectroelectrochemistry, magnetic measurements, and X&#8208;ray crystallography. The electronic structures and spectroscopic properties of the radical&#8208;based chromophores were also probed by density functional theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations. These nickel(II) and copper(II) complexes represent the first stable radical compounds with a MB&#8208;DIPY ligand.

         <title>Development of bacterial enzyme&#8208;based biosensor for the detection and quantification of selenate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An enzymatic biosensor has been developed for the determination of selenate (SeO  4  2&#8208;  ), in which selenate reductase (SeR) is chemically attached to a gold disk electrode by lipoic acid N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide ester as linker, allowing the catalytic reduction of the SeO  4  2&#8208;  to SeO  3  2&#8208;  . Modification of the gold electrode has been characterized by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF&#8208;SIMS), and electrochemistry. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) measurements have been performed in different buffers for selenate determination. Under optimum condition, the calibration curve was linear in range 7.0&#8208;3900.0 &#181;g/L with a limit of detection and quantification 4.97 and 15.56 &#181;g/L, respectively. The interference of the relevant oxyanions: SO  4  2&#8722;  , NO  3  &#8208;  , NO  2  &#8208;  , PO  4  3&#8208;  and AsO  4  3&#8208;  has been studied on the determination of SeO  4  2&#8208;  . Finally, the enzyme&#8208;modified surface has been used for the determination of SeO  4  2&#8208;  in different real water samples with a recovery of 95.2&#8208;102.4%.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A nickel&#8208;catalysed reductive cross&#8208;coupling reaction between benzyl sulfonium salts and benzyl bromides is reported. Simple, stable and readily available sulfonium salts have shown their ability as leaving groups in cross electrophile coupling, allowing the formation of challenging sp3&#8208;sp3 carbon&#8208;carbon bonds, towards the synthesis of interesting dihydro stilbene derivatives. In addition, benzyl tosyl derivatives have been demonstrated to be suitable substrates for the reductive cross&#8208;coupling via  in situ  formation of the corresponding sulfonium salt.</dc:description>

The bridging MeCN ligand in the dicopper(I) complex [(DPFN)Cu2(&#956;,&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;1&#8208;MeCN)][X]2 (X=WCA) can easily be replaced by white phosphorus (P4) or yellow arsenic (As4) to yield [(DPFN)Cu2(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;E4)][X]2 (E=P, As). The coordinated intact E4 tetrahedra can be further selectively functionalized with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) and cyclic alkyl amino carbenes (CAACs) under cleavage of E&#8722;E bonds, while using a small and strong NHC leads to the release of the pnictogen tetrahedra as P4 and grey arsenic, respectively.







Abstract
The bridging MeCN ligand in the dicopper(I) complexes [(DPFN)Cu2(&#956;,&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;1&#8208;MeCN)][X]2 (X=weakly coordinating anion, NTf2 (1&#8201;a), FAl[OC6F10(C6F5)]3 (1&#8201;b), Al[OC(CF3)3]4 (1&#8201;c)) was replaced by white phosphorus (P4) or yellow arsenic (As4) to yield [(DPFN)Cu2(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;E4)][X]2 (E=P (2&#8201;a&#8211;c), As (3&#8201;a&#8211;c)). The molecular structures in the solid state reveal novel coordination modes for E4 tetrahedra bonded to coinage metal ions. Experimental data and quantum chemical computations provide information concerning perturbations to the bonding in coordinated E4 tetrahedra. Reactions with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) led to replacement of the E4 tetrahedra with release of P4 or As4 and formation of [(DPFN)Cu2(&#956;,&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;1&#8208;MeNHC)][X]2 (4&#8201;a,b) or to an opening of one E&#8722;E bond leading to an unusual E4 butterfly structural motif in [(DPFN)Cu2(&#956;,&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;1&#8208;E4DippNHC)][X]2 (E=P (5&#8201;a,b), E=As (6)). With a cyclic alkyl amino carbene (EtCAAC), cleavage of two As&#8722;As bonds was observed to give two isomers of [(DPFN)Cu2(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;As4EtCAAC)][X]2 (7&#8201;a,b) with an unusual As4&#8208;triangle+1 unit.

         <title>Dynamic Stereochemistry of a Biphenyl&#8208;Bisprolineamide Model Catalyst and its Imidazolidinone Intermediates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solvent&#8208;dependent dynamic stereochemistry of a biphenyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bisprolineamide is characterized by VCD spectroscopy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in&#8197;situ VCD spectroscopy enables the determination of the imidazolidinones without extensive NMR analysis. In combination with NMR reaction monitoring, even the absolute configuration of a minor imidazolidinone species can be determined.







Abstract
In this study, we characterize the dynamic stereochemistry of a biphenyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bis(proline amide) catalyst in chloroform and DMSO as representative weakly and strongly hydrogen bonding solvents. Using vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) based spectra calculations, we show that the preferred axial stereochemistry of the catalyst is determined by solute&#8208;solvent interactions. Explicitly considering solvation with DMSO molecules is found to be essential to correctly predict the conformational preferences of the catalyst. Furthermore, we investigate the stereochemistry of the corresponding enamines and imidazolidinones that are formed upon reaction with isovaleraldehyde. The enamines are found to rapidly convert to endo&#8208;imidazolidinones and the thermodynamically favored exo&#8208;imidazolidinones are formed only slowly. The present study demonstrates that the stereochemistry of these imidazolidinones can be deduced directly from the VCD spectra analysis without any further detailed analysis of NMR spectra. Hence, we herein exemplify the use of VCD spectroscopy for an in&#8197;situ characterization of intermediates relevant in asymmetric catalysts.

Visualization of cation dynamics inside living systems represent a major breakthrough at the crossroad of chemistry and cellular physiology. In this article, we bring up three emerging concepts in this field: 1)&#8197;Red&#8208;shifting cation indicators towards far&#8208;red and NIR channels; 2)&#8197;directing the sensors to various subcellular localizations; 3)&#8197;lowering the phototoxicity of sensors for long term recording. These initiatives collectively echo the advocate of 4D physiology, in which biological processes within living systems can be panoramically unveiled under 3D, long&#8208;term, and multi&#8208;channel imaging with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolutions.







Abstract
Visualization of cation dynamics inside a living system represent a major breakthrough at the crossroad of chemistry and cellular physiology. Since the inception of BAPTA&#8208;based cellular calcium indicators in the 1980s, generations of chemical and genetically encoded ion indicators spanning the visible spectrum have been developed. In this article, we bring up three emerging concepts in this field: 1.&#8197;red&#8208;shifting cation indicators towards far&#8208;red and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) channels; 2.&#8197;directing the indicators to various subcellular localizations; 3.&#8197;lowering the phototoxicity of indicators for long term recording. These initiatives collectively echo the advocate of 4D cellular physiology, where biological processes within living systems can be panoramically unveiled under 3D, long&#8208;term, and multi&#8208;channel imaging with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. This outlook poses exciting challenges and opportunities for chemists to upgrade the toolkit of fluorescent indicators as key enablers for a new era of imageomics.

         <title>Molecular Ln(III)&#8722;H&#8722;E(II) Linkages (Ln=Y, Lu; E=Ge, Sn, Pb)</title>

         <dc:description>
Reductive alkane elimination reacting the aryltin trihydride Ar*SnH3 with donor free alkyl complexes [Cp*2Ln(CH{SiMe3}2)] (Ln=Y, Lu) in the presence of diethyl methylamine gives access to Ln(III)&#8722;H&#8722;Sn(II) linkages. The respective germanium and lead entities can be generated via exchange of hydrido&#8208;bridged dimers [(Ar*EH)2] (E=Ge, Pb) and [(Cp*2Ln(&#956;&#8208;H)2] (Ln=Y, Lu). Lead derivatives [Cp*2Ln(&#956;&#8208;H)2PbAr*] engage in H/D&#8208;exchange in benzene&#8208;d6 at ambient temperature.







Abstract
Following the alkane&#8208;elimination route, the reaction between tetravalent aryl tintrihydride Ar*SnH3 and trivalent rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metallocene alkyls [Cp*2Ln(CH{SiMe3}2)] gave complexes [Cp*2Ln(&#956;&#8208;H)2SnAr*] implementing a low&#8208;valent tin hydride (Ln=Y, Lu; Ar*=2,6&#8208;Trip2C6H3, Trip=2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylphenyl). The homologous complexes of germanium and lead, [Cp*2Ln(&#956;&#8208;H)2EAr*] (E = Ge, Pb), were accessed via addition of low&#8208;valent [(Ar*EH)2] to the rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal hydrides [(Cp*2LnH)2]. The lead compounds [Cp*2Ln(&#956;&#8208;H)2PbAr*] exhibit H/D exchange in reactions with deuterated solvents or dihydrogen.

         <title>Six&#8208;Step Continuous Flow Synthesis of Diclofenac Sodium via Cascade Etherification/Smiles Rearrangement Strategy: Tackling the Issues of Batch Processing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intensified six&#8208;step continuous flow synthesis of diclofenac sodium from aniline and chloroacetic acid was developed by using a challenging and unprecedented etherification/Smiles rearrangement cascade as the key step in two types of flow reactors. The total isolated yield of diclofenac sodium was up to 63&#8201;% with an average yield of above 90&#8201;% for each step within a total residence time of 205&#8197;min.







Abstract
Diclofenac sodium is a widely used nonsteroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug (NSAID) as over&#8208;the&#8208;counter (OTC) medication for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Herein, the development of an intensified six&#8208;step continuous flow synthesis of diclofenac sodium from commercially available aniline and chloroacetic acid is described. A challenging and unprecedented etherification/Smiles rearrangement cascade of 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;N&#8208;phenylacetamide and 2,6&#8208;dichlorophenol into hydroxyacetyldiphenylamine operated with the precise control of reaction conditions in continuous flow was realized as the key step in this multistep synthetic chemistry. The undesired amide hydrolysis in Smiles rearrangement was addressed and the extra installation of N&#8208;chloroacetyl group in current industrial batch mode was avoided. Diclofenac sodium was obtained in 63&#8201;% isolated yield with an average yield of above 90&#8201;% for each step in a total residence time of 205&#8197;min.

         <title>The Use of Bridging Ligand Substituents to Bias the Population of Localized and Delocalized Mixed&#8208;Valence Conformers in Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mixed&#8208;valence complexes [{Cp*(dppe)Ru}(&#956;&#8208;C&#8801;CArC&#8801;C){Ru(dppe)Cp*]+ are known to exist as a mixture of conformations, with electronic character varying between the localized and delocalized limits in response to the particular mutual orientations of the metal and bridge fragments. Electronic structure calculations using the hybrid density functional BLYP35&#8208;D3 and a continuum solvent model in combination with spectroelectrochemical studies have demonstrated that the conformational population, and hence the dominant electronic structure, can be biased through the steric and electronic properties of the diethynylarylene (Ar) moiety.







Abstract
The electronic structure and associated spectroscopic properties of ligand&#8208;bridged, bimetallic &#8216;mixed&#8208;valence&#8217; complexes of the general form {M}(&#956;&#8208;B){M+} are dictated by the electronic couplings, and hence orbital overlaps, between the metal centers mediated by the bridge. In the case of complexes such as [{Cp*(dppe)Ru}(&#956;&#8208;C&#8801;CC6H4C&#8801;C){Ru(dppe)Cp*}]+, the low barrier to rotation of the half&#8208;sandwich metal fragments and the arylene bridge around the acetylene moieties results in population of many energy minima across the conformational energy landscape. Since orbital overlap is also sensitive to the particular mutual orientations of the metal fragment(s) and arylene bridge through a Karplus&#8208;like relationship, the different members of the population range exemplify electronic structures ranging from strongly localized (weakly coupled Robin&#8208;Day Class II) to completely delocalized (Robin&#8208;Day Class III). Here, we use electronic structure calculations with the hybrid density functional BLYP35&#8208;D3 and a continuum solvent model in combination with UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR and IR spectroelectrochemical studies to show that the conformational population in complexes [{Cp*(dppe)Ru}(&#956;&#8208;C&#8801;CArC&#8801;C){Ru(dppe)Cp*]+, and hence the dominant electronic structure, can be biased through the steric and electronic properties of the diethynylarylene (Ar) moiety (Ar=1,4&#8208;C6H4, 1,4&#8208;C6F4, 1,4&#8208;C6H2&#8208;2,5&#8208;Me2, 1,4&#8208;C6H2&#8208;2,5&#8208;(CF3)2, 1,4&#8208;C6H2&#8208;2,5&#8208;iPr2).

The isothermal compression of a plane&#8208;square nickel(II) bis(N,N&#8208;diethyldithiocarbamate) complex above 1.23&#8197;GPa leads to a phase transition. The clearly visible strain in the transition between phases &#945; and &#948; is associated with the exchange of the anagostic Ni&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C interaction donor from methylene to the methyl group and with the significantly increased contribution of thioureide form II in the resonance electronic structure of ligands present in phase &#948;.







Abstract
The pressure&#8208;induced transformation of plane&#8208;square complex nickel(II) bis(N,N&#8208;diethyldithiocarbamate) between its soft dithiocarbamate (form I) and thioureide (form II) mesomeres is coupled to the interchange of anagostic Ni&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C interactions from methylene to the methyl group, respectively. At 1.23&#8197;GPa, the clearly visible giant anomalous compressibility of the crystal reveals a potential&#8208;energy difference of 5.4&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 between the two complex forms. The structural and spectroscopic results, which are supported by quantum&#8208;mechanical calculations, connect this solid&#8208;state phase transition with the mesomeric transition, and this is accompanied by the conformational transformation of anagostic Ni&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C rearrangement and formation of the charge&#8208;assisted S&#8722;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C bond under pressure.

         <title>A Shared Prebiotic Formation of Neopterins and Guanine Nucleosides from Pyrimidine Bases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guanosine and pterins are depicted as the constellation Gemini. Guanine nucleosides are one of the immortal survivors of prebiotic chemistry, becoming the focus of many prebiotic reactions. However, like Pollux from Greek mythology, guanosine would not have been born alone&#8212;pterins would have been formed in equal (or, in this case, even in major) parts through prebiotic reactions. Pterins, similar to Castor, would have been equally important for nascent biochemical reactions, paving the way to modern biochemistry. More information can be found in the Research Article by C. Menor&#8208;Salv&#225;n, N.&#8197;V. Hud, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200714).

         <title>Selective [2+1+1] Fragmentation of P4 by heteroleptic Metallasilylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Si cuts in: Heteroleptic metallasilylenes L1(Cl)MSiL2 (M=Al 1, Ga 2) react selectively with white phosphorus in a [2+1+1] fragmentation of the P4 tetrahedron to give L1(Cl)MPSi(L2)PPSi(L2)PM(Cl)L1 (M=Al 3, Ga 4).







Abstract
Small&#8208;molecule activation by low&#8208;valent main&#8208;group element compounds is of general interest. We here report the synthesis and characterization (1H, 13C, 29Si NMR, IR, sc&#8208;XRD) of heteroleptic metallasilylenes L1(Cl)MSiL2 (M=Al 1, Ga 2, L1=HC[C(Me)NDipp]2, Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3; L2=PhC(NtBu)2). Their electronic nature was analyzed by quantum chemical computations, while their promising potential in small&#8208;molecule activation was demonstrated in reactions with P4, which occurred with unprecedented [2+1+1] fragmentation of the P4 tetrahedron and formation of L1(Cl)MPSi(L2)PPSi(L2)PM(Cl)L1 (M=Al 3, Ga 4).

         <title>Synthesis and Characteristics of Self&#8208;Assembled Multifunctional Ln3+&#8208;DNA Hybrid Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly between lanthanide ions (Ln3+) and DNA enabled the synthesis of multifunctional Ln3+&#8208;DNA hybrid coordination polymer nanospheres (CPNSs). Not only a series of different Ln3+ and DNA hybrid CPNSs were synthesized, but one hybrid CPNS contains two kinds of Ln3+ also was obtained. Integrating different Ln3+ into one nanosphere could expand the applications of the hybrid Ln3+&#8208;DNA CPNSs in bioimaging and biosensing.







Abstract
Owing to the unique catalytic, optical and magnetic properties, lanthanides (Ln) as multicomponent biomarkers, are widely used in the field of optical sensing, mass spectrometry and magnetic resonance imaging. As ligands, DNA molecules have good biocompatibility, high stability, cost efficiency, programmability and biodegradability. Based on the coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly between Ln ions (Ln3+) and DNA molecules, a multifunctional Ln3+&#8208;DNA hybrid coordination polymers (CPs) were synthesized. Not only a series of different Ln3+ (single Ln3+) and DNA hybrid CPs were synthesized, but one hybrid CP contains two kinds of Ln3+ was obtained. Besides, the synthetic CPs in cell fluorescence imaging and miRNA sensing also exhibited high performance. This work provides a novel idea for the synthesis of DNA based nanomaterials, which is promising for biologically&#8208;related applications.

         <title>Efficient and sustainable in situ photo&#8208;Fenton to remove phenolic pollutants by NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;101(Fe)/Ti3C2Tx Schottky&#8208;heterojunction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with abundant active sites, a class of materials composed of metal nodes and organic ligands, is widely used for photocatalytic degradation of pollutants.   However, the rapid recombination of photoinduced carriers of MOFs extremely limits its photocatalytic degradation performance.  Herein, Ti  3  C  2  T  x  nanosheets&#8208;based  NH  2  &#8208;MIL&#8208;101(Fe)  hybrids  with  Schottky&#8208;heterojunction  were fabricated by  in situ  hydrothermal  assembly for improved  photocatalytic  activity  .  The photodegradation efficiencies of NH  2  &#8208;MIL&#8208;101(Fe)/Ti  3  C  2  T  x  (N&#8208;M/T) hybrids for phenol and chlorophenol were 96.36% and  99.83%  within 60 minutes, respectively.  The N&#8208;M/T  Schottky&#8208;heterojunction  duly transferred electrons to Ti  3  C  2  T  x  nanosheets surface via built&#8208;in electric fields, effectively suppressing the  recombination of  photogenerated carriers, thereby improving the photocatalytic performance of NH  2  &#8208;MIL&#8208;101(Fe). Moreover, the Fe&#8208;mixed&#8208;valence in the N&#8208;M/T led to improvement in the efficiency of the  in situ  generated  photo&#8208;Fenton  reactions, further enhancing the photocatalytic activity with more generated reactive oxygen species (ROS).  The study proposes a highly effective for removing phenolic pollutants in waste water.</dc:description>

However, the rapid recombination of photoinduced carriers of MOFs extremely limits its photocatalytic degradation performance.  Herein, Ti  3  C  2  T  x  nanosheets-based  NH  2  -MIL-101(Fe)  hybrids  with  Schottky-heterojunction  were fabricated by  in situ  hydrothermal  assembly for improved  photocatalytic  activity  .  The photodegradation efficiencies of NH  2  -MIL-101(Fe)/Ti  3  C  2  T  x  (N-M/T) hybrids for phenol and chlorophenol were 96.36% and  99.83%  within 60 minutes, respectively.  The N-M/T  Schottky-heterojunction  duly transferred electrons to Ti  3  C  2  T  x  nanosheets surface via built-in electric fields, effectively suppressing the  recombination of  photogenerated carriers, thereby improving the photocatalytic performance of NH  2  -MIL-101(Fe). Moreover, the Fe-mixed-valence in the N-M/T led to improvement in the efficiency of the  in situ  generated  photo-Fenton  reactions, further enhancing the photocatalytic activity with more generated reactive oxygen species (ROS).  The study proposes a highly effective for removing phenolic pollutants in waste water.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>In this study, a practical and straightforward synthesis of &#946;&#8208;( E )&#8208;trifluoromethylstyrenes by ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H bond activation was developed. The readily available and inexpensive 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropene (BTP), a non&#8208;ozone depleting reagent, was used as a reservoir of 3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropyne. With this approach, the monofunctionalization of a panel of heteroarenes was possible in a safe and scalable manner (23 examples, up to 87% yield). Mechanistic investigations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were also conducted to get a better understanding of the mechanism of this transformation. These studies suggested that 1) a cyclometallated ruthenium complex enabled the transformation, 2) this latter exhibited high efficiency in this transformation compared to the commercially available [RuCl 2 ( p &#8208;cymene)] 2 and 3) the mechanism proceeded through a bis&#8208;cyclometallated ruthenium intermediate for the carboruthenation step.</dc:description>

This reaction can be performed either with cobaltocene as chemical reductant, or electrochemically. These experimental observations are consistent with the disproportionation of the hydroperoxo group in the putative Fe  II  (OOH) intermediate generated upon reduction of the Fe  III  (OOH) starting complex.

         <title>Chiral Motifs in Highly Interpenetrated Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Formed from Achiral Tetrahedral Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate the formation of highly interpenetrated frameworks. An interesting observation is the presence of very large adamantane&#8208;shaped cages in a single network, making these crystals new entries in the collection of diamondoid&#8208;type metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). The frameworks were constructed by assembling tetrahedral pyridine ligands and copper dichloride. Currently, the networks&#8217; degree of interpenetration is among the highest reported and increases when the size of the ligand is increased. Highly interpenetrated frameworks typically have low surface contact areas. In contrast, in our systems, the voids take up to 63% of the unit cell volume. The frameworks are chiral but formed from achiral components. The chirality is manifested by the coordination chemistry frameworks around the metal center, the structure of the helicoidal channels and the motifs of the individual networks. Channels of both handedness are present within the unit cells. This phenomenon shapes the walls of the channels, which are composed of 10, 16, or 32 chains correlated to the degree of interpenetration 10&#8208;, 16&#8208; and 32&#8208;fold. By changing the distance between the center of the ligand and the coordination moieties, we succeeded in tuning the diameter of the channels. Relatively large channels were formed, having diameters up to 31.0 &#197; &#215; 14.8 &#197;.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two novel rod&#8208;packing metal&#8208;organic frameworks (RPMOF) are constructed by regulating the&#160;in&#8208;situ formation of the capping agent. In CPM&#8208;s7, carboxylate linkers extend 1D manganese&#8208;oxide chains in four additional directions, forming 3D RPMOF. The substitution of Mn2+&#160;with a stronger Lewis acidic Co2+, leads to an acceleration of the hydrolysis&#8208;prone sulfonate linker, resulting in presence of sulfate ions to reduce two out of the four carboxylate&#8208;extending directions, and thus forming a new 2D rod&#8208;packing CPM&#8208;s8.&#160;Density functional theory calculations and magnetization measurements reveal ferrimagneric ordering of CPM&#8208;s8, signifying the potential of exploring 2D RPMOF for effective low&#8208;dimensional magnetic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A Rapid, Highly Sensitive and Selective Phosgene Sensor Based on 5,6&#8208;Pinenepyridine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The toxicity of phosgene (COCl  2  ) combined with its extensive use as a reactant and building block in the chemical industry make its fast and accurate detection a prerequisite. We have developed a carboxylic derivative of 5,6&#8208;pinenepyridine which is able to act as colorimetric and fluorimetric sensor for phosgene in air and solution. For the first time, the formation of a pyrido&#8208;[2,1&#8208;  a  ]isoindolone was used for this purpose. In solution, the sensing reaction is extremely fast (under 5 s), selective and highly sensitive, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 9.7 nM / 0.8 ppb. When fixed on a solid support, the sensor is able to detect the presence of gaseous phosgene down to concentrations of 0.1 ppm, one of the lowest values reported to date.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoselective Acylation of Nucleosides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acylated nucleoside analogs play an important role in medicinal chemistry and are extremely useful precursors to various other nucleoside analogs. However, chemoselective acylation of nucleosides usually requires several protection and deprotection steps due to the competing nucleophilicity of hydroxy and amino groups. In contrast, direct, protecting group free chemoselective acylation of nucleosides is a preferred strategy due to lower cost and fewer overall synthetic steps. Herein, we report a simple and efficient chemoselective acylation of nucleosides and nucleotides under mild reaction conditions, giving either O &#8208; or N &#8208;acylated products respectively with excellent chemoselectivity.</dc:description>

In contrast, direct, protecting group free chemoselective acylation of nucleosides is a preferred strategy due to lower cost and fewer overall synthetic steps. Herein, we report a simple and efficient chemoselective acylation of nucleosides and nucleotides under mild reaction conditions, giving either O - or N -acylated products respectively with excellent chemoselectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rapid discrimination of bacterial drug resistivity by array based cross&#8208;validation using 2D&#8208;MoS2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The precise discrimination of microbes based on family, class and drug resistivity is quintessential for the early diagnosis of infectious diseases. Information about the type and strength of drug resistivity can help the analyst to prescribe the suitable antibiotic in proper dosage to completely eradicate microbes without giving them a chance to gain further resistance. Herein, we propose a sensor array based on the use of cationic two&#8208;dimensional MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;s and green fluorescence protein (GFP) as building blocks. Cationic surfaces of receptors with various functionality were suitable for tunable interaction with anionic surfaces of microbes. The array successfully discriminates six different bacteria strains. The versatile ability of the receptors to bind with the wild type as well as their corresponding ampicillin resistant strain contributed significantly towards the rapid detection with high sensitivity. The optimized array was able to classify five different types and three different extent of drug resistant variants of &lt;italic&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/italic&gt; (EC) by using bacteria cells and lysates. Finally, we have introduced the cross identification method using both bacteria cells and lysates and we found a great enhancement of detection in sensitivity and accuracy. This is the first time we are reporting this approach which can be extended to many other methods for better accuracy in array based detection.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;situ preparation of CsPbBr3@CsPb2Br5 composite assisted with water as a highly efficient and stable catalyst for photothermal CO2 hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lead halide perovskite has triggered a lot of research due to its superior optical properties. However, halide perovskite materials have poor environmental stabilities and are easily affected by external factors such as water and heat, resulting in structural decomposion and performance failure. Contrary to this commonplace concept, here we find that CsPbBr  3  (CPB) can convert to CsPb  2  Br  5  (CP2B5) partially when meeting a small amount of water, and the CsPbBr  3  @CsPb  2  Br  5  (CPB@CP2B5) composite is synthesized by an in&#8208;situ method accordingly. The CPB@CP2B5 composite shows an enhanced catalytic performance compared with pure CPB, as well as a dramatically synergistic effect of photo and thermal for catalytic CO  2  hydrogenation. The CO production rate of CPB@CP2B5 is determined as 69 &#181;mol g  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  under light irradiation at 200 &#176;C, which is 156.8 and 43.4 times higher than that under pure photo (0.44 &#181;mol g  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  ) and pure thermal (1.59 &#181;mol g  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  ) condition, respectively. Meanwhile, the CPB@CP2B5 sample is also stable, which shows no significant decline in the catalytic activity during 5 cycles of repeated experiments. The probable mechanism is explored by utilizing a series of in&#8208;situ characterizations.</dc:description>

         <title>A Happy Get&#8208;Together &#8211; Probing Electrochemical Interfaces by Non&#8208;Linear Vibrational Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical interfaces are key structures in energy storage and catalysis. Hence, a molecular understanding of the active sites at these interfaces, their solvation, the structure of adsorbates, and the formation of solid&#8208;electrolyte interfaces, is crucial for an in&#8208;depth mechanistic understanding of their function. Vibrational sum&#8208;frequency generation (VSFG) spectroscopy has emerged as an operando spectroscopic technique to monitor complex electrochemical interfaces due to its intrinsic interface sensitivity and chemical specificity. Thus, this review discusses the happy get&#8208;together between VSFG spectroscopy and electrochemical interfaces. Methodological approaches are discussed for answering core issues associated with the behavior of adsorbates on electrodes, the structure of solvent adlayers, the transient formation of reaction intermediates, and the emergence of solid electrolyte interphase in battery. Thereby, this review provides a critical inventory of what we believe is a highly promising avenue to bring optical spectroscopy to use in modern material research in energy conversion and storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct C&#8208;H trifluoromethylation of (hetero)arenes in water enabled by organic photoredox&#8208;active amphiphilic nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoredox&#8208;catalyzed chemical conversions are predominantly operated in organic media to ensure good compatibility between substrates and catalysts. Yet, when conducted in aqueous media, they are an attractive, mild, and green way to introduce functional groups into organic molecules. We here show that trifluoromethyl groups can be readily installed into a broad range of organic compounds using water as the reaction medium and light as the energy source. To bypass solubility obstacles, we developed robust water&#8208;soluble polymeric nanoparticles that accommodate reagents and photocatalysts within their hydrophobic interior under high local concentrations. By taking advantage of the high excited state reduction potential of  N  &#8208;phenylphenothiazine (PTH) through UV light illumination, the direct C&#8208;H trifluoromethylation of a wide array of small organic molecules is achieved selectively with high substrate conversion. Key to our approach is slowing down the production of CF  3  radicals during the chemical process by reducing the catalyst loading as well as the light intensity, thereby improving effectiveness and selectivity of this aqueous photocatalytic method. Furthermore, the catalyst system shows excellent recyclability and can be fueled by sunlight. The method we propose here is versatile, widely applicable, energy efficient, and attractive for late&#8208;stage introduction of trifluoromethyl groups into biologically active molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Spectroscopic, Crystallographic, and Electrochemical Study of Different Manganese(II)&#8208;Substituted Keggin&#8208;Type Phosphomolybdates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adjusting the RedOx activity of polyoxometalate catalysts is a key challenge for the catalysis of selective oxidation reactions. For this purpose, we have investigated the possibility of influencing the RedOx potential by the introduction of an additional RedOx&#8208;active element. Thereby, we created Keggin&#8208;type POMs with up to three different elements in the metal framework. We present an advanced and reproducible synthetic procedure to incorporate Mn(II) and additionally V(V) into Keggin&#8208;type heteropolyacids alongside comprehensive characterization of the new molecules. The success of our syntheses was confirmed by vibrational spectroscopy (IR and Raman) and elemental analysis. Furthermore, the new compounds were analyzed with NMR&#8208;spectroscopy to investigate the characteristics of the polyoxometalates in solution. The structures of successfully crystalized compounds were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Moreover, all synthesized compounds were characterized using UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy and electrochemical analysis to get further insights into the electronic transfer processes and redox potentials.</dc:description>

         <title>Double&#8208;&#963;&#8208;Bonded Close&#8208;Shell Dimers and Peroxy&#8208;Linked Open&#8208;Shell Dimer Derived from a&#160;C3&#160;Symmetric Trioxophenalenyl Neutral Diradical</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel neutral diradical of &#960;&#8208;extended phenalenyl derivative having three oxo&#8208;groups, tri&#8208;  tert  &#8208;butyl&#8208;1,4,7&#8208;trioxophenalenyl, and two types of the corresponding&#160;&#963;&#8208;dimers were investigated. Quantum chemical calculations showed that the neutral diradical is in triplet ground state having doubly degenerate singly occupied molecular orbitals. The neutral diradical undergoes a&#160;&#963;&#8208;dimerization, generating two types of&#160;&#963;&#8208;dimers immediately after the preparation. One of the&#160;&#963;&#8208;dimers, which was selectively generated in the crystalline state, was a close&#8208;shell dimer linked through double&#8208;&#963;&#8208;bonds on the phenalenyl skeleton with a long C&#8211;C bond length of 1.66 &#197;.

Furthermore, the temperature&#8208;dependent&#160;  1  H NMR and ESR spectra revealed that these&#160;&#963;&#8208;dimers are in equilibrium in the solution state by the reversible&#160;&#963;&#8208;bond formation/cleavage via the neutral diradical as a key intermediate.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A novel neutral diradical of &#960;-extended phenalenyl derivative having three oxo-groups, tri-  tert  -butyl-1,4,7-trioxophenalenyl, and two types of the corresponding&#160;&#963;-dimers were investigated. Quantum chemical calculations showed that the neutral diradical is in triplet ground state having doubly degenerate singly occupied molecular orbitals. The neutral diradical undergoes a&#160;&#963;-dimerization, generating two types of&#160;&#963;-dimers immediately after the preparation. One of the&#160;&#963;-dimers, which was selectively generated in the crystalline state, was a close-shell dimer linked through double-&#963;-bonds on the phenalenyl skeleton with a long C&#8211;C bond length of 1.66 &#197;. The other &#963;-dimer, which existed only in the solution state, was a peroxy-linked open-shell dimer in which one&#160;&#963;-bond was formed between two oxygen atoms. Furthermore, the temperature-dependent&#160;  1  H NMR and ESR spectra revealed that these&#160;&#963;-dimers are in equilibrium in the solution state by the reversible&#160;&#963;-bond formation/cleavage via the neutral diradical as a key intermediate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The elusive phosphinidene&#8208;chlorotetrylenes, [PGeCl] and [PSiCl] have been stabilized by the hetero&#8208;bileptic cyclic alkyl(amino) carbene (cAAC), N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands, and isolated in the solid state at room temperature as the first neutral monomeric species of this class with the general formulae (L)P&#8722;ECl(L&#8242;) (E = Ge,  3a  &#8208;  3c  ; E = Si,  6  ; L = cAAC; L&#8242; = NHC). Compounds  3a  &#8208;  3c  have been synthesized by the reaction of cAAC&#8208;supported potassium phosphinidenides [cAAC=PK(THF)  x  ]  n  (  1a  &#8208;  1c  ) with the adduct NHC:&#8594;GeCl  2  (  2  ). Similarly, compound  6  has been synthesized via reaction of  1a  with NHC:&#8594;SiCl  2  adduct  4  . Compounds  3a  &#8208;  3c  , and  6  have been structurally characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometric analysis. DFT calculations revealed that the heteroatom P in  3  bears two lone pairs; the non&#8208;bonding pair with 67.8% of s&#8208; and 32% of p character, whereas, the other lone pair is involved in &#960; backdonation to the C  cAAC  &#8722;N &#960;* of cAAC. The Ge atom in  3  contains a lone pair with 80% of s character and slightly involved in the &#960; backdonation to C  NHC  . EDA&#8208;NOCV analyses showed that two charged doublet fragments {(cAAC)(NHC)}  +  , and {PGeCl}  &#8722;  prefer to form one covalent electron&#8208;sharing &#963; bond, one dative &#963; bond, one dative &#960; bond, and a charge polarized weak &#960; bond. The covalent electron&#8208;sharing &#963; bond contributes to the major stabilization energy to the total orbital interaction energy of  3  , enabling the first successful isolations of this class of compounds (  3  ,  6  ) in the laboratory.</dc:description>

         <title>Targeting pathogenic DNA and RNA repeats: a conceptual therapeutic way for repeat expansion diseases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Expansions of short tandem repeats (STRs) in the human genome cause nearly 50 neurodegenerative diseases, which are mostly inheritable, nonpreventable and incurable, posing as a huge threat to human health. Non&#8208;B DNAs formed by STRs are thought to be structural intermediates that can cause repeat expansions. The subsequent transcripts harbouring expanded RNA repeats can further induce cellular toxicity through forming specific structures. Direct targeting of these pathogenic DNA and RNA repeats has emerged as a new potential therapeutic strategy to cure repeat expansion diseases. In this conceptual review, we first introduce the roles of DNA and RNA structures in the genetic instabilities and pathomechanisms of repeat expansion diseases, then describe structural features of DNA and RNA repeats with a focus on the tertiary structures determined by X&#8208;ray crystallography and solution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and finally discuss recent progress and perspectives of developing chemical tools that target pathogenic DNA and RNA repeats for curing repeat expansion diseases.</dc:description>

CsKTaF  7  crystallizes in the centric  Pnma  space group, while CsNaTaF  7  crystallizes in the polar  Cmc  2  1  space group and exhibits moderate and phase&#8208;matchable NLO activity. Both halides possess large optical band gaps above 5.0 eV. The crystal structure evolution, optical properties, and detailed theory calculations of these two halides were elucidated in this work.</dc:description>

         <title>Triplet&#8208;triplet Annihilation Dynamics of Naphthalene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA) of naphthalene has been investigated by using multi&#8208;reference methods along with quantum dynamics simulations. The study involves obtaining the mechanistic details of the process and understand the time evolution of nuclear wavepacket on the computed potential energy surfaces. The results suggest that the TTA is mediated by conical intersections (CIs). It is also demonstrated that the strong light&#8208;matter interaction increases the efficiency of TTA based photon upconversion.







Abstract
Triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA) is a spin&#8208;allowed conversion of two triplet states into one singlet excited state, which provides an efficient route to generate a photon of higher frequency than the incident light. Multiple energy transfer steps between absorbing (sensitizer) and emitting (annihilator) molecular species are involved in the TTA based photon upconversion process. TTA compounds have recently been studied for solar energy applications, even though the maximum upconversion efficiency of 50&#8201;% is yet to be achieved. With the aid of quantum calculations and based on a few key requirements, several design principles have been established to develop the well&#8208;functioning annihilators. However, a complete molecular level understanding of triplet fusion dynamics is still missing. In this work, we have employed multi&#8208;reference electronic structure methods along with quantum dynamics to obtain a detailed and fundamental understanding of TTA mechanism in naphthalene. Our results suggest that the TTA process in naphthalene is mediated by conical intersections. In addition, we have explored the triplet fusion dynamics under the influence of strong light&#8208;matter coupling and found an increase of the TTA based upconversion efficiency.

In addition, we have explored the triplet fusion dynamics under the influence of strong light-matter coupling and found an increase of the TTA based upconversion efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lewis Acid Assisted Br&#248;nsted Acid Catalysed Decarbonylation of Isocyanates: A Combined DFT and Experimental Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and mild reaction protocol for the decarbonylation of isocyanates using catalytic amounts of Lewis acidic boranes is described. The electronic nature and the position of the substituents (ortho/meta/para) bound to isocyanate controls the chain length and composition of the products.







Abstract
An efficient and mild reaction protocol for the decarbonylation of isocyanates has been developed using catalytic amounts of Lewis acidic boranes. The electronic nature (electron withdrawing, electron neutral, and electron donating) and the position of the substituents (ortho/meta/para) bound to isocyanate controls the chain length and composition of the products formed in the reaction. Detailed DFT studies were undertaken to account for the formation of the mono/di&#8208;carboxamidation products and benzoxazolone compounds.

         <title>Positive Cooperativity Induced by Interstrand Interactions in Silver(I) Complexes with &#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;Diimine Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Big softie: AgI ([Kr]4d10) possesses similar electronic structure to CuI ([Ar]3d10), but a larger ionic radius and increased covalency when bound to soft &#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;diimine ligands. Consequently, the thermodynamic formation of unsaturated [AgI(&#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;diimine)]+ complexes is favored in organic solvents. Moreover, the addition of a second bidentate ligand to give saturated pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral [AgI(&#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;diimine)2]+ building blocks is driven by positive allosteric cooperativity when the ligands are decorated with terminal methyl groups.







Abstract
The allosteric positive cooperativity accompanying the formation of compact [CuI(&#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;diimine)2]+ building blocks contributed to the historically efficient synthesis of metal&#8208;containing catenates and knotted assemblies. However, its limited magnitude can easily be overcome by the negative chelate cooperativity that controls the overall formation of related polymetallic multistranded helicates and grids. Despite the more abundant use of analogous dioxygen&#8208;resistant [AgI(&#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;diimine)2]+ units in modern entangled metallo&#8208;supramolecular assemblies, a related thermodynamic justification was absent. Solid&#8208;state structural characterizations show the successive formation of [AgI(&#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;diimine)(CH3CN)][X] and [AgI(&#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;diimine)2][X] upon the stepwise reactions of &#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;diimine=2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (bpy) or 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (phen) derivatives with AgX (X=BF4&#8722;, ClO4&#8722;, PF6&#8722;). In room&#8208;temperature, 5&#8211;10&#8197;mM acetonitrile solutions, these cationic complexes exist as mixtures in fast exchange on the NMR timescale. Spectrophotometric titrations using the unsubstituted bpy and phen ligands point to the statistical (=non&#8208;cooperative) binding of two successive bidentate ligands around AgI, a mechanism probably driven by the formation of hydrophobic belts, that overcomes the unfavorable decrease in the positive charge borne by the metallic cation. Surprisingly, the addition of methyl groups adjacent to the nitrogen donors (6,6&#8242; positions in dmbpy; 2,9 positions in dmphen) induces positive cooperativity for the formation of [Ag(dmbpy)2]+ and [Ag(dmphen)2]+, a trend assigned to additional stabilizing interligand interactions. Adding rigid and polarizable phenyl side arms in [Ag(Brdmbpy)2]+ further reinforces the positively cooperative process, while limiting the overall decrease in metal&#8211;ligand affinity.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Long Lived Luminescent Triplet Excited States in Cyclic (Alkyl)(amino)carbene Complexes of Zn(II) Halides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zinc(II) halide cAAC dimers undergo photochemically induced rearrangements in the triplet excited state, one of which involves rotation of one of the cAAC ligands giving an asymmetric dimeric structure at 77&#8197;K. Consequently, transformation of 3XCT/LE to purely 3LE states localized at the carbene lead to ultra&#8208;long lived phosphorescence (millisecond regime). At room temperature, further rearrangements are observed. Similar photoreactions occur in monomeric [ZnX2(cAAC)(MeCN)] complexes.







Abstract
The high element abundance and d10 electron configuration make ZnII&#8208;based compounds attractive candidates for the development of novel photoactive molecules. Although a large library of purely fluorescent compounds exists, emission involving triplet excited states is a rare phenomenon for zinc complexes. We have investigated the photophysical and &#8208;chemical properties of a series of dimeric and monomeric ZnII halide complexes bearing a cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (cAAC) as chromophore unit. Specifically, [(cAAC)XZn(&#956;&#8208;X)2ZnX(cAAC)] (X=Cl (1), Br (2), I (3)) and [ZnX2(cAAC)(NCMe)] (X=Br (4), I (5)) were isolated and fully characterized, showing intense visible light photoluminescence under UV irradiation at 297&#8197;K and fast photo&#8208;induced transformation. At 77&#8197;K, the compounds exhibit improved stability allowing to record ultra&#8208;long lifetimes in the millisecond regime. DFT/MRCI calculations confirm that the emission stems from 3XCT/LEcAAC states and indicate the phototransformation to be related to asymmetric distortion of the complexes by cAAC ligand rotation. This study enhances our understanding of the excited state properties for future development and application of new classes of ZnII phosphorescent complexes.

         <title>A High&#8208;Valent Ru&#8208;PCP Pincer Catalyst for Hydrogenation of Carbonyl and Carboxyl Compounds under Molecular Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient hydrogenation of carbonyl and carboxyl compounds under molecular hydrogen catalyzed by a structurally well&#8208;defined high&#8208;valent RuIV catalyst is described. The catalyst exhibits better reactivity toward molecular hydrogen than the low&#8208;valent analog and allows hydrogen activation even at room temperature.







Abstract
Low&#8208;valent metals traditionally dominate the domain of catalytic hydrogenation. However, metal&#8208;ligand cooperating (MLC) catalytic systems, operating through heterolytic H&#8722;H bond splitting by a Lewis acidic metal and a basic ligand site, do not require an electron&#8208;rich metal. On the contrary, high&#8208;valent metals that induce weaker back donation facilitate heterolytic bond activation. Here we report, for the first time, the efficient hydrogenation of carbonyl and carboxyl compounds under molecular hydrogen catalyzed by a structurally well&#8208;defined RuIV catalyst bearing a bifunctional PCP pincer ligand. The catalyst exhibits reactivity toward molecular hydrogen superior to that of the low&#8208;valent analog and allows hydrogen activation even at room temperature.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence and Circular Dichroism of Bichromophoric Difluoroboron&#8208;&#946;&#8208;diketonates: Inversion and Enhanced Chirality Based on Spatial Arrangements and Self&#8208;Assembly</title>

Two bichromophoric difluoroboron &#946;&#8208;diketonates (DFBs) with different connections to a chiral cyclohexanediamine bridge display inversion of chirality. When using different solvent systems, para Cy&#8208;DFB shows self&#8208;assembly in spherical aggregates with enhanced chiroptical properties as compared with solution state. Ultrasonication and heating induces the formation of supramolecular assembled nanowires with higher g value of 0.015.







Abstract
We synthesized two bichromophoric difluoroboron&#8208;&#946;&#8208;diketonates (DFB) connected in para and meta positions by using cyclohexane diamine as a chiral bridge (para and meta (R/S)&#8208;CyDFB). TD&#8208;DFT calculations revealed that the variation in connectivity of the DFB units leads to different spatial arrangements and a chirality inversion of the bichromophoric DFB. Higher gabs values were obtained in (R/S)&#8208;CyDFB connected in para as compared to meta position. Aggregation of para (R/S)&#8208;CyDFB in mixture of solvents increase the glum values as compared to its monomeric form. Ultrasonication and heating induced the formation of highly ordered nano&#8208;helical wires of para (R/S)&#8208;CyDFB that increased the glum values to 0.015. On the other hand, meta (R/S)&#8208;CyDFB failed to form highly ordered self&#8208;assembled wires due to hindered H&#8208;binding sites. These observations indicate that the chiroptical properties of DFB bi&#8208;chromophore system can be modulated with self&#8208;assembly and spatial arrangement of the chromophores.

         <title>How Ionization Catalyzes Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionization of the dienophile is an effective method to enhance the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between buta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene and acrylaldehyde. The origin of this ionization catalysis is both a reduction in steric Pauli repulsion and simultaneous enhancement of the orbital interactions between the reactants. Our work demonstrates the similarities and differences between radical&#8211;cation and Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed Diels&#8211;Alder reactions. More information can be found in the Research Article by T.&#8197;A. Hamlin, F.&#8197;M. Bickelhaupt, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200987).

         <dc:description>We report the efficient synthesis of a family of organoplatinum&#160;complexes, featuring a (2&#8208;([2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridin]&#8208;6&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#160;ligand, that incorporates peripheral side&#8208;chains aiming at enhancing and diversifying its interaction capabilities. These include a di&#8208;isopropyl carbamoyl amide, a morpholine ethylenamide, 2 enantiomeric proline imides and an oxazole. The binding affinities of the Pt&#8208;complexes were evaluated via UV&#8208;vis and fluorescence titrations, against 5 topologically&#8208;distinct DNA structures, including c&#8208;myc G&#8208;quadruplex, two telomeric&#160;G&#8208;quadruplexes, a duplex&#160;and a single&#8208;stranded&#160;DNA. All compounds exhibited binding selectivity in favor of c&#8208;myc, with association constants&#160;in the range of 105  M  &#8208;1  , lower affinity for both folds of 22AG and for ds26 and negligible affinity for polyT. Up to 200&#8208;fold&#160;emission enhancements upon addition of excess c&#8208;myc&#160;were demonstrated, providing a basis for optical selectivity, since optical response to other tested DNAs was low. A c&#8208;myc DNA&#8208;melting experiment showed significant stabilizing abilities, with the most potent binder&#160;exhibiting&#160;&#916;T  m  &gt;30  o  C, at 1:5 DNA&#8208;to&#8208;ligand molar ratio. This&#160;study implied contributions of the diverse side&#8208;chains to helix stabilization. To gain direct evidence of the nature of the interactions, mixtures of c&#8208;myc with the 4&#160;most promising compounds were studied via UVRR&#160;spectroscopy, which revealed end&#8208;stacking binding mode, combined with interactions of side&#8208;chains with loop nucleobases. Docking simulations provided&#160;insights into the binding modes for the Pt&#8208;compounds, suggesting that the binding preference for 2 alternative orientations of the G4&#160;thymine &#8216;cap&#8217; (&#8216;open&#8217; vs. &#8216;closed&#8217;), as well as the relative contributions to affinity from end&#8208;stacking and H&#8208;bonding, are highly dependent on the nature of the interacting side&#8208;chain.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding of Photo&#8208;induced Reversible Rearrangement from Borepin to Borirane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first reversible photoisomerization between a borepin and a borirane was reported in the photo&#8208;induced reactions of B(npy)Ar  2  (npy=2&#8208;(naphthalen&#8208;1&#8208;yl) pyridine, Ar=phenyl or electron rich aryl). (S. Wang, et al.  Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.  2019  ,  58  , 66836687). In this work, the detailed mechanisms of the unprecedented reversible photoisomerization between the borepin (compound  a  ) and the borirane (compound  b  ) of B(npy)Ph  2  in the first excited singlet (S  1  ) state and the ground (S  0  ) state were studied by carrying out calculations with the complete active space self&#8208;consistent field (CASSCF) and its second&#8208;order perturbation (CASPT2) methods combined with time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT). The calculation results show that photoexcitation of  a  &#8208;S  0  at 365 nm and  b  &#8208;S  0  at 450 nm populate their S  1  state with evident charge transfer characteristics. The photoisomerization is triggered in S  1  state and ends in S  0  state, where the intersection points in a (S  1  /S  0  )  x  intersection seam participate in and promote phenyl migration and ring closure processes. Furthermore, we reveal that the not large energy difference (less than 0.6 eV) and similar conjugation properties of &#960; electrons between  a  &#8208;S  0  and  b  &#8208;S  0  are responsible for their unique photo&#8208;reversible reactivity, compared with those of the isomers of the thermally reversible compound B(ppy)Mes  2  . Our results contribute to understand the excited&#8208;state reactivity of organoboron compounds and will be useful to support the design of new boron&#8208;based photoresponsive materials.</dc:description>

         <title>On the evolutionary history of the twenty encoded amino acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:
a&#8208;Amino acids are essential molecular constituents of life, twenty of which are privileged because they are encoded by the ribosomal machinery. The question remains open as to why this number and why this 20 in particular, an almost philosophical question that cannot be conclusively resolved. They are closely related to the evolution of the genetic code and whether nucleic acids, amino acids, and peptides appeared simultaneously and were available under prebiotic conditions when the first self&#8208;sufficient complex molecular system emerged on Earth. This report focuses on prebiotic and metabolic aspects of amino acids and proteins starting with meteorites, followed by their formation, including peptides, under plausible prebiotic conditions, and the major biosynthetic pathways in the various kingdoms of life.
Coenzymes play a key role in the present analysis in that amino acid metabolism is linked to glycolysis and different variants of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA, rTCA, and the incomplete horseshoe version) as well as the biosynthesis of the most important coenzymes. Thus, the report opens additional perspectives and facets on the molecular evolution of primary metabolism.</dc:description>

This report focuses on prebiotic and metabolic aspects of amino acids and proteins starting with meteorites, followed by their formation, including peptides, under plausible prebiotic conditions, and the major biosynthetic pathways in the various kingdoms of life.
Coenzymes play a key role in the present analysis in that amino acid metabolism is linked to glycolysis and different variants of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA, rTCA, and the incomplete horseshoe version) as well as the biosynthesis of the most important coenzymes. Thus, the report opens additional perspectives and facets on the molecular evolution of primary metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Calibrating catalytic DNA nanostructures for site&#8208;selective protein modification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many biomedical fields rely on proteins that are selectively modified. These can be attached using reactive or catalytic moieties, but the position where these moieties are attached is often poorly controlled. We assessed how catalyst position affects the efficiency and selectivity of protein modification. For this, we anchored a template DNA strand to three different proteins, which were subsequently hybridized to DNA strands that contained catalysts at different positions. We found a strong correlation between the catalyst&#8208;to&#8208;protein distance and the efficiency of protein modification for acyl transfer catalysts, which operate via a covalently bound reactant intermediate. Additionally, we found that the catalyst&#8217;s distance and orientation with respect to the protein surface, also influences its site&#8208;selectivity. A catalyst operating with unbound reactant intermediates showed only enhanced efficiency. Our results are rationalized using computational simulations, showing that one&#8208;point anchoring of the DNA construct leads to notable differences in the site of modification.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Extra&#8208;Framework Cations in Faujasite Zeolites for Capture of Trace Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of cost&#8208;effective sorbents for direct capture of trace CO  2  (&lt;1%) from the atmosphere is an important and challenging task. Natural or commercial zeolites are promising sorbents, but their performance in adsorption of trace CO  2  has been poorly explored to date.  Herein, we report a systematic study on capture of trace CO  2  by commercial faujasite zeolites, where we found that the extra&#8208;framework cations played a key role on their performance.  Under dry conditions, Ba&#8208;X displays high dynamic uptake of 1.79 and 0.69 mmol g  &#8208;1  at CO  2  concentrations of 10000 and 1000 ppm, respectively, and shows excellent recyclability in the temperature&#8208;swing adsorption processes. K&#8208;X exhibits perfect moisture resistance, and &gt;95 % dry CO  2  uptake can be preserved under relative humidity of 74%.&#160;  In situ  solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy, synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and neutron diffraction reveal two binding sites for CO  2  in these zeolites, namely the basic framework oxygen atoms and the divalent alkaline earth metal ions. This study unlocks the potential of low&#8208;cost natural zeolites for applications in direct air capture.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;step N&#8208;terminal modification of proteins via a bio&#8208;inspired copper(II)&#8208;mediated aldol reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemical modification of proteins is an effective technique for manipulating the properties and functions of proteins, and for creating protein&#8208;based materials. The N&#8208;terminus is a promising target for single&#8208;site modification that provides modified proteins with uniform structures and properties. In this paper, we propose a copper(II)&#8208;mediated aldol reaction with 2&#8208;pyridinecarboxaldehyde (2&#8208;PC) derivatives as an operationally simple method to selectively modify the N&#8208;terminus of peptides and proteins at room temperature and physiological pH. The copper(II) ion activates the N&#8208;terminal amino acids by complexation with an imine of the N&#8208;terminal amino acid and 2&#8208;PCs, realizing the selective formation of the nucleophilic intermediate at the N&#8208;terminus. This results in a stable carbon&#8208;carbon bond between the 2&#8208;PCs and the &#945;&#8208;carbon of various N&#8208;terminal amino acids.&#12288;The reaction is applied to four different proteins, including biopharmaceuticals such as filgrastim and trastuzumab. The modified trastuzumab retains the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 recognition activity.</dc:description>

The power of carboxylates: Simple carboxylate salts can rival strong amidine bases, such as DBU, in their catalytic power to isomerize &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated thioesters to corresponding conjugated &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated thioesters. The mechanism involves a rate&#8208;determining protonation step!







Abstract
We demonstrate herein the capacity of simple carboxylate salts &#8211; tetrametylammonium and tetramethylguanidinium pivalate &#8211; to act as catalysts in the isomerization of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated thioesters to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated thioesters. The carboxylate catalysts gave reaction rates comparable to those obtained with DBU, but with fewer side reactions. The reaction exhibits a normal secondary kinetic isotope effect (k1H/k1D=1.065&#177;0.026) with a &#946;,&#947;&#8208;deuterated substrate. Computational analysis of the mechanism provides a similar value (k1H/k1D=1.05) with a mechanism where &#947;&#8208;reprotonation of the enolate intermediate is rate determining.

         <title>Opening of the Diamondoid Cage upon Ionization Probed by Infrared Spectra of the Amantadine Cation Solvated by Ar, N2, and H2O</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cage&#8208;opening upon ionization: Three isomers of Ama+ (1&#8208;aminoadamantane) are identified by IR spectroscopy &#8208; the cage isomer (I) generated by vertical ionization and separated by substantial barriers from two bicyclic distonic iminium ions generated by cage opening (primary radical II) and subsequent 1,2 H shift (tertiary radical III). The potential energy profile for this reaction depends strongly on solvation and H&#8594;NH2 substitution.







Abstract
Radical cations of diamondoids, a fundamental class of very stable cyclic hydrocarbon molecules, play an important role in their functionalization reactions and the chemistry of the interstellar medium. Herein, we characterize the structure, energy, and intermolecular interaction of clusters of the amantadine radical cation (Ama+, 1&#8208;aminoadamantane) with solvent molecules of different interaction strength by infrared photodissociation (IRPD) spectroscopy of mass&#8208;selected Ama+Ln clusters, with L=Ar (n&#8804;3) and L=N2 and H2O (n=1), and dispersion&#8208;corrected density functional theory calculations (B3LYP&#8722;D3/cc&#8208;pVTZ). Three isomers of Ama+ generated by electron ionization are identified by the vibrational properties of their rather different NH2 groups. The ligands bind preferentially to the acidic NH2 protons, and the strength of the NH&#8230;L ionic H&#8208;bonds are probed by the solvation&#8208;induced red&#8208;shifts in the NH stretch modes. The three Ama+ isomers include the most abundant canonical cage isomer (I) produced by vertical ionization, which is separated by appreciable barriers from two bicyclic distonic iminium ions obtained from cage&#8208;opening (primary radical II) and subsequent 1,2 H&#8208;shift (tertiary radical III), the latter of which is the global minimum on the Ama+ potential energy surface. The effect of solvation on the energetics of the potential energy profile revealed by the calculations is consistent with the observed relative abundance of the three isomers. Comparison to the adamantane cation indicates that substitution of H by the electron&#8208;donating NH2 group substantially lowers the barriers for the isomerization reaction.

Comparison to the adamantane cation indicates that substitution of H by the electron-donating NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group substantially lowers the barriers for the isomerization reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Azole&#8208;Directed Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By the assisting promotion effect of the azolyl group itself, an efficient Co&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of azolyl&#8208;substituted alkenes has been successfully developed for the convenient introduction of chirality near the azole ring. It was the first utilization of an azole as the directing group in Co&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation. Chiral azoles were obtained in high yields and with excellent enantioselectivities under mild conditions and the gram&#8208;scale experiment went smoothly at up to 2000 substrate/catalyst.







Abstract
The azole&#8208;directed cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of alkenes has been developed with high efficiency. With this approach, chiral pyrazole compounds were obtained in quantitative yields and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee) under mild conditions, and the hydrogenation was conducted on a gram scale with up to 2000 TON. Several useful applications were demonstrated including the convenient introduction of &#946;&#8208;chirality to a drug intermediate containing an azole ring.

         <title>Donor Acceptor Complexes between the Chalcogen Fluorides SF2, SeF2, SeF4 and TeF4 and an N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Donor&#8208;acceptor complexes between the carbene 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (IPr) and EF2 (E=S, Se) or EF4 (E=Se, Te) were conveniently synthesized. The compounds were structurally investigated by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and a suite of density functional theory (DFT) methods were employed in order to elucidate fine electronic details of the chemical environment around the central chalcogen atoms.







Abstract
The majority of binary chalcogen fluorides are fiercely reactive and extremely difficult to handle. Here, we show that access to crystalline donor&#8208;acceptor complexes between chalcogen difluorides (sulfur, selenium) and tetrafluorides (selenium, tellurium) with the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (IPr) is possible conveniently and safely without the need to generate the highly unstable EF2 (E=S, Se) or the very toxic and corrosive SeF4.

         <title>Atmospheric&#8208;temperature&#160;chain reaction towards ultrathin non&#8208;crystal phase construction for high&#8208;efficient water splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Combining self&#8208;sacrifice of highly crystalline substance to design multistep chain reaction towards ultrathin active&#8208;layer construction for high&#8208;performance water splitting, particularly coupled with a atmospheric&#8208;temperature conditions as well as the environment&#8208;benignity aqueous environment, is extremely intriguing and full of challenges. Here, taking cobalt carbonate hydroxides (CCH) as the initial crystalline material, we choose Lewis acid metal salt of Fe(NO  3  )  3  to induce aqueous&#8208;phase chain reaction generating free CO  3  2&#8208;  ions thus subsequent FeCO  3  instant hydrolysis. The resultant ultrathin amorphous Fe&#8208;based hydroxide layer of Ca. 5 nm in thickness on CCH results in considerable catalytical activity to catalyze oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), yielding 10/50 mA&#183;cm  &#8208;2  at overpotentials of 230/266.5 mV for OER and 72.5/197.5 mV for HER. The catalysts can constantly operate in 1.0 M KOH over 48 and 45 hours for OER and HER, respectively. As bifunctional catalysts for alkaline electrolyzer assembly, a cell voltage as low as 1.53 V was necessitated to yield 10 mA&#183;cm  &#8208;2  (1.7 V at 50 mA&#183;cm  &#8208;2  ). This work rationally builds high&#8208;efficiency electrochemical bifunctional water&#8208;splitting catalysts and offers a trial in the controllable establishment of nano&#8208;level ultrathin lattice disorder layer through an a atmospheric&#8208;temperature chemical route.</dc:description>

The catalysts can constantly operate in 1.0 M KOH over 48 and 45 hours for OER and HER, respectively. As bifunctional catalysts for alkaline electrolyzer assembly, a cell voltage as low as 1.53 V was necessitated to yield 10 mA&#183;cm  -2  (1.7 V at 50 mA&#183;cm  -2  ). This work rationally builds high-efficiency electrochemical bifunctional water-splitting catalysts and offers a trial in the controllable establishment of nano-level ultrathin lattice disorder layer through an a atmospheric-temperature chemical route.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pyrimidoquinazolinophenanthroline opens next chapter in design of bridging ligands for artificial photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and detailed characterization of a new Ru polypyridine complex containing a heteroditopic bridging ligand with previously unexplored metal&#8208;metal distances is presented. Due to the twisted geometry of the novel ligand, the resultant division of the ligand in two distinct subunits leads to steady state as well as excited state properties of the corresponding mononuclear Ru(II) polypyridine complex resembling those of prototype [Ru(bpy)  3  ]  2+  (bpy&#160;=&#160;2,2&#180;&#8208;bipyridine). The localization of the initially optically excited and the nature of the long&#8208;lived excited states on the Ru&#8208;facing ligand spheres is evaluated by resonance Raman and fs&#8208;TA spectroscopy, respectively, and supported by DFT and TDDFT calculations. Coordination of a second metal (Zn or Rh) to the available bis&#8208;pyrimidyl&#8208;like coordination sphere strongly influences the frontier orbitals, apparent by,  e.g.  , luminescence quenching. Thus, the new bridging ligand motif offers electronic properties which can be adjusted by the nature of the second metal center. Using the heterodinuclear Ru&#8208;Rh complex, visible light&#8208;driven reduction of NAD  +  to NADH was achieved, highlighting the potential of this system for photocatalytic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular magnetic materials based on {CoIII(Tp*)(CN)3}&#8208; cyanidometallate: combined magnetic, structural and 59Co NMR study.</title>

         <dc:description>The cyanidocobaltate of formula  fac  &#8208;PPh4[CoIII(Me2Tp)(CN)  3  ]&#183;CH  3CN (  1  ) has been used as a metalloligand to prepare polynuclear magnetic complexes (  Me2  Tp=hydrotris(3,5&#8208;dimethylpyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)borate). The association of  1  with  in situ  prepared [Fe  II  (bik)  2  (MeCN)  2  ](OTf)  2  (bik=bis(1&#8208;methylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ketone) leads to a molecular square of formula {[CoIII{(Me2Tp)(CN)3]2[FeII(bik)2]2}(OTf)2&#183;4MeCN&#183;2H2O (  2  ), whereas the self&#8208;assembly of  1  with preformed cluster [CoII2(OH2)(piv)4(Hpiv)4] in MeCN leads the two&#8208;dimensional network of formula {[CoII2(piv)3]2[CoIII(Me2Tp)(CN)3]2&#183;2CH3CN}  &#8734; (3). These compounds were structurally characterized via single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis and their spectroscopic (FTIR, UV&#8208;Vis and  59Co NMR) properties and magnetic behaviours were investigated. Bulk magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal that  1  is diamagnetic and  3  is paramagnetic throughout the explored temperature range, whereas  2  showcases thermally driven spin&#8208;crossover behaviour. In contrast  2  exhibits sharp spin transition centered at  ca.  292 K . Compound  2  also exhibits photomagnetic effects at low temperature, selective light irradiations allowing to promote reversibly and repeatedly low&#8208;spin &#8660; high&#8208;spin conversion. Besides, the diamagnetic nature of the Co(III) building block allows us studying these compounds by means of  59  Co NMR spectroscopy. Here  59  Co chemical shift has been used as a magnetic probe to corroborate experimental magnetic data obtained from bulk magnetic susceptibility measurements. An influence of the magnetic state of the neighbouring atoms is observed on the  59  Co NMR signals. Moreover, for the very first time,  59  Co NMR technique has been successfully introduced to investigate molecular materials with distinct magnetic properties.</dc:description>

Several transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free dehalogenative, dehydrogenative borylation, cyclization and alkyne activation approaches for the formation of highly valuable heterocyclic carbon&#8208;boron bond are reviewd.







Abstract
Heteroaryl boronic acids and esters are extremely important and valuable intermediates because of their wide application in the synthesis of marketed drugs and bioactive compounds. Over the last couple of decades, the construction of highly important heteroaryl carbon&#8208;boron bonds has created huge attention. The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free protocols are more green, less sensitive to air and moisture, and also economically advantageous over the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based protocols. The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free C&#8722;H borylation of heteroarenes and C&#8722;X (X=halogen) borylation of heteroaryl halides represents an excellent approach for their synthesis. Also, various cyclization and alkyne activation protocols have been recently established for their synthesis. The goal of this review article is to summarize the existing literature and the current state of the art for transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free synthesis of heteroaryl boronic acid and esters.

Through&#8208;space type photocatalyst: Novel donor&#8208;acceptor dyads containing [2.2]&#8208; and [3.3]paracyclophane as the bridging moiety were synthesized and used to effectively fabricate dye&#8208;sensitized hydrogen production systems.

Abstract
Novel donor&#8211;acceptor dyads containing [2.2]&#8208; and [3.3]paracyclophane (PCP) as the bridging moiety were synthesized and used to effectively fabricate dye&#8208;sensitized hydrogen production systems. All the prepared compounds had a phenothiazine and a cyanoacrylic acid/pyridinyl acrylonitrile moiety acting as an electron donor and acceptor, respectively. Although cyclic voltammetry measurements showed similar electron&#8208;donating properties among all the synthesized dyads, the lowest absorption energy of the [2.2]PCP moiety was lower than that of the [3.3]PCP one; this was due to its shorter distance between benzene rings, which could effectively drive the charge transfer between the donor and acceptor chromophores. Under visible light (&gt;395&#8197;nm), a dyad&#8208;loaded photocatalyst in a 0.5&#8197;M aqueous glycerol solution generated detectable hydrogen gases. The optimal turnover number and photocurrent order exhibited the same trend as the hydrogen production rate since the suggested number of excited photons played a critical role in hydrogen production.

         <title>Advances towards Cell&#8208;Specific Gene Transfection: A Small&#8208;Molecule Approach Allows Order&#8208;of&#8208;Magnitude Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Picky for cancer cells: A small&#8208;molecule transfection vector containing a strong DNA binder and a targeting moiety shows low toxicity and a tenfold selectivity for cell lines expressing biotin receptors (BR). The binder contains the tailor&#8208;made guanidinocarbonypyrrol (GCP) motif. A tetrapeptide of only four GCP&#8208;modified lysine residues is usually sufficient to achieve transfection. Addition of an appropriate linker deactivates the vector. Further attachment of a biotin label allowed BR&#8208;rich cancer cell lines to be targeted.







Abstract
A transfection vector that can home in on tumors is reported. Whereas previous vectors that allow moderately cell selective gene transfection used larger systems, this small&#8208;molecule approach paved the way for precise structure&#8208;activity relationship optimization. For this, biotin, which mediates cell selectivity, was combined with the potent DNA&#8208;binding motif tetralysine&#8208;guanidinocarbonypyrrol via a hydrophilic linker, thus enabling SAR&#8208;based optimization. The new vector mediated biotin receptor (BR)&#8208;selective transfection of cell lines with different BR expression levels. Computer&#8208;based analyses of microscopy images revealed a preference of one order of magnitude for the BR&#8208;positive cell lines over the BR&#8208;negative controls.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Carbonylative Cross&#8208;Coupling of Alkyl Iodides and Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general copper&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative cross&#8208;coupling between amines and alkyl iodides based on a simple combination of catalytic CuCl and PMDETA in the presence of NaOH is reported. Primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl iodides and primary, cyclic and acyclic secondary amines as well as anilines were all shown to be suitable reaction partners, affording the corresponding amides in good to excellent yields. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that a radical pathway is operative and the key role of carbon monoxide.







Abstract
A general copper&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative cross&#8208;coupling between amines and alkyl iodides is reported. Using a simple combination of catalytic amounts of copper(I) chloride and N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8221;,N&#8221;&#8208;pentamethyldiethylenetriamine in the presence of sodium hydroxide under carbon monoxide pressure, a broad range of alkyl iodides and amines can be efficiently coupled to the corresponding amides that are obtained in good to excellent yields. Notable features of this process &#8211; the first one relying on a base metal catalyst &#8211; include the availability and low cost of the catalytic system, its successful use with primary, secondary, tertiary alkyl iodides and all classes of amines &#8211; with no or limited competing nucleophilic substitution without CO incorporation &#8211; as well as its efficiency with complex alkyl iodides and amines. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that a radical pathway is operative and the key role of CO.

         <title>An Expedient Method for the Umpolung Coupling of Enols with Heteronucleophiles
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A useful strategy: Herein, we report an umpolung strategy mediated by a hypervalent iodine(III) reagent for the functionalization of enol derivatives with different heteronucleophiles including carboxylic acids, thiols, alcohols, primary and secondary amines, azides and carbamates generated from CO2. Relevant examples for the derivatization of natural products and pharmaceutical compounds are also presented. The mechanism of the reaction was investigated by DFT calculations and experimental studies.







Abstract
In this paper, we present an unprecedented and general umpolung protocol that allows the functionalization of silyl enol ethers and of 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds with a large range of heteroatom nucleophiles, including carboxylic acids, alcohols, primary and secondary amines, azide, thiols, and also anionic carbamates derived from CO2. The scope of the reaction also extends to carbon&#8208;based nucleophiles. The reaction relies on the use of 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;3,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1&#955;3[d][1,2]iodaoxole, which provides a key &#945;&#8208;brominated carbonyl intermediate. The reaction mechanism has been studied experimentally and by DFT, and we propose formation of an unusual enolonium intermediate with a halogen&#8208;bonded bromide.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Induced Structural Change in Artificial Heterometallic&#8208;Oxide Cluster Mimicking the Photosynthetic Oxygen&#8208;Evolving Center</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oxygen&#8208;evolving center (OEC) in photosynthesis is a unique Mn  4  CaO  5  &#8208;cluster that catalyzes the water&#8208;splitting reaction in nature. Understanding its catalytic mechanism for the O=O bond formation is of great challenge and long&#8208;standing issue, which is severely restricted by the lack of precise structure and mechanism mimics of this heterometallic&#8208;oxide cluster. Herein, we report two synthetic (Mn  3  XO  4  )  2  O&#8208;clusters (X = Sr  2+  , La  3+  ) that closely mimic the heterometallic&#8208;oxide Mn  3  XO  4  cubane and three different types of &#956;&#8208;oxide bridges (  &#956;  2  &#8208;O  2  &#8208;  ,  &#956;  3  &#8208;O  2  &#8208;  , and  &#956;  4  &#8208;O  2  &#8208;  ) simultaneously as seen in the OEC. By resolving the crystal structures of both oxidized and reduced forms of the cluster, we have identified significant redox&#8208;induced structural changes that take place on the &#956;  2  &#8208;oxide bridge, rather than the  &#956;  4  &#8208;oxide or  &#956;  3  &#8208;oxide bridges. Our results provide chemical insights into understanding the reactivity of three different types of oxide bridges in the biological Mn  4  CaO  5  &#8208;cluster in PSII.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conjugated polymers feature promising structure and properties for photocatalytic water splitting. Herein, a hydrolysis strategy was demonstrated to rationally modulate the surface hydrophilicity and band structures of conjugated polybenzothiadiazoles. High hydrophilicity not only enhances the dispersions of polymeric solids in an aqueous solution but also reduces the absorption energy of water molecules. Besides, both theoretical and experimental results reveal that a more positive valence band potential is generated, which contributes to enhancing the photocatalytic water oxidation performance. Accordingly, the surface&#8208;modified conjugated polymers show largely promoted photocatalytic water oxidation activities by deposition of cobalt oxides as cocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Online reaction monitoring with fast and flow&#8208;compatible diffusion NMR spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Online monitoring by flow NMR spectroscopy is a powerful approach to study chemical reactions and processes, which can provide mechanistic understanding, and drive optimisations. However, some of the most useful methods for mixture analysis and reaction monitoring are not directly applicable in flow conditions. This is the case of classic diffusion&#8208;ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY) methods, which can be used to separate the spectral information for mixture&#8217;s components. We describe a fast and flow compatible diffusion NMR experiment, that makes it possible to collect accurate diffusion data for samples flowing at up to 3 mL/min. We use it to monitor the synthesis of a Schiff base with a flow&#8208;tube with a time resolution of approximately 2 minutes. The one&#8208;shot flow&#8208;compatible diffusion NMR described here open many avenues for reaction monitoring applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Geometrically Mismatched Hydrogen&#8208;bonded Framework Composed of Tetratopic Carboxylic Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous organic frameworks possessing interactive free sites in the pore have attracted much attention due to their potential to show the site&#8208;originated specific functionalities. Herein, we demonstrate that such a framework could be constructed using a concept of geometrically mismatched frameworks composed of phenanthroline&#8208;based tetratopic carboxylic acid  CP&#8208;Phen  . Simple recrystallization of  CP&#8208;Phen  yielded a solvent included porous framework  CP&#8208;Phen&#8208;1  , in which three of four carboxy groups form hydrogen&#8208;bonded dimer to form a ladder&#8208;shaped framework, while the remained one does not participate in framework formation due to geometrical mismatch and interacts with solvent molecules through weak hydrogen&#8208;bonding. This result implies that our proposed strategy is effective to provide free interactive sites in porous frameworks. Although  CP&#8208;Phen&#8208;1  undergoes two&#8208;step structural transformation accompanied by hydrogen&#8208;bond rearrangements upon loss of solvent molecules, the activate framework shows good thermal stability up to 360 &#176;C and selective CO  2  adsorption.</dc:description>

         <title>Four&#8208;Step Spin Crossover in a New Cyano&#8208;Bridged Iron&#8208;Silver Coordination Polymer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new guest&#8208;free Hofmann clathrate analogue Fe(2&#8208;ethoxypyrazine)2{Ag(CN)2}2 which undergoes a four&#8208;step spin crossover during the transition from the low&#8208;spin to the high&#8208;spin state is reported. At the first step 1/3 of centers become high spin, at the second step another 1/3 of centres become high spin, at the third step spin mixed crystallographic centres are observed, and after the fourth step all centers are high spin.







Abstract
Spin&#8208;crossover complexes with multistep transitions attract much attention due to their potential applications as multi&#8208;switches and for data storage. A four&#8208;step spin crossover is observed in the new iron(II)&#8208;based cyanometallic guest&#8208;free framework compound Fe(2&#8208;ethoxypyrazine)2{Ag(CN)2}2 during the transition from the low&#8208;spin to the high&#8208;spin state. A reverse process occurs in three steps. Crystallographic studies reveal an associated stepwise evolution of the crystal structures. Multiple transitions in the reported complex originate from distinct FeII sites which exist due to the packing of the ligand with a bulky substituent.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Synthesis and Biological Applications of Peptidoglycan Fragments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptidoglycan, the material comprising the cell wall of bacteria, remains an attractive but complex synthetic target for enzymologists and immunologists. This review encompasses the various modern synthetic organic and chemoenzymatic routes for the formation of molecular peptidoglycan and the derivatives thereof: muramyl dipeptides, Park nucleotides, peptidoglycan lipids, and peptidoglycan fragments.







Abstract
The biosynthesis, breakdown, and modification of peptidoglycan (PG) play vital roles in both bacterial viability and in the response of human physiology to bacterial infection. Studies on PG biochemistry are hampered by the fact that PG is an inhomogeneous insoluble macromolecule. Chemical synthesis is therefore an important means to obtain PG fragments that may serve as enzyme substrates and elicitors of the human immune response. This review outlines the recent advances in the synthesis and biochemical studies of PG fragments, PG biosynthetic intermediates (such as Park's nucleotides and PG lipids), and PG breakdown products (such as muramyl dipeptides and anhydro&#8208;muramic acid&#8208;containing fragments). A rich variety of synthetic approaches has been applied to preparing such compounds since carbohydrate, peptide, and phospholipid chemical methodologies must all be applied.

         <title>A Catalyst and Solvent Free Route for the Synthesis of N&#8208;Substituted Pyrrolidones from Levulinic Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work offers a simple methodolgy to avoid solvents and added catalysts for the synthesis of different kinds of N&#8208;substituted pyrrolidones. Different aniline derivatives with varying steric and electronic demands, aliphatic amines and benzyl amines were responsive to this methodology. The method was also modified for the synthesis of industrially important &#947;&#8208;valerolactone. Control experiments and DFT studies have also been carried out to find out the possible mechanistic pathway.







Abstract
An efficient, metal&#8208;free, catalyst&#8208;free and solvent&#8208;free methodology for the reductive amination of levulinic acid with different anilines has been developed using HBpin as the reducing reagent. This protocol offers an excellent method to avoid solvents and added catalysts on the synthesis of different kinds of N&#8208;substituted pyrrolidones under metal free conditions. It is also the first report for the synthesis of different pyrrolidones by solvent&#8208;free as well as catalyst&#8208;free methods. The proposed mechanism for the formation of pyrrolidone has been supported by DFT calculations and control experiments.

         <dc:description>Single atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as a new frontier in catalysis area such as electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, and enzymatic catalysis. Aided by recent advances in synthetic methodologies of nanomaterials, atomic characterization technologies, and theoretical calculation modeling, various of SACs have been prepared for a variety of catalytic reactions. To meet the requirements of SACs with distinctive performance and appreciable selectivity, many researches have been carried out to adjust the coordination configuration and electronic properties of SACs. This concept summarizes the latest advances in the experimental and computational efforts aimed at tuning the axial coordination of the SACs. Series of atoms, functional groups or even macrocycle molecules are oriented introduced into the atomic metal center, and how this affects the electrocatalytic performance are also reviewed.

         <dc:description>We designed and synthesized photochromic tetrathienyl corannulene compounds, 1,2,7,8&#8208;tetrakis(2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;5&#8208;phenylthiophen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)corannulene (  1  ) and 1,2,7,8&#8208;tetrakis(2,4&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;5&#8208;phenylthiophen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)corannulene (  2  ), by fusing two units of photochromic terarylene with a curved aromatic corannulene with a promising antenna effect. The compound  1  exhibited highly sensitive photoreactivity with a large molar absorption coefficient of 8.2 &#215; 10  4  M  &#8211;1  cm  &#8211;1  and practically photon&#8208;quantitative photocyclization. On the other hands, terarylene derivatives with a planar aromatic phenanthrene, 9,10&#8208;bis(2,4&#8208;methyl&#8208;5&#8208;phenylthiophen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)phenanthrene (  4  ) showed no photoreactivity. The reason for such a difference was attributed to the predominance of the photoreactive atropisomers amplified with energy migration and the shortened distance between reactive carbons induced by curved structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective oxidations using a cytochrome P450 enzyme variant driven with surrogate oxygen donors and light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase enzymes are versatile catalysts which have been adapted for multiple applications in chemical synthesis. Mutation of a highly conserved active site threonine to a glutamate can convert these enzymes into peroxygenases that utilise hydrogen peroxide (H  2  O  2  ). Here we use the T252E&#8208;CYP199A4 variant to study peroxide driven oxidation activity using H  2  O  2  and urea&#8208;hydrogen peroxide (UHP). We demonstrate that the T252E variant has a higher stability to H  2  O  2  in the presence of substrate that can undergo carbon&#8208;hydrogen abstraction. This peroxygenase variant could efficiently catalyse  O  &#8208;demethylation and an enantioselective epoxidation reaction (94% e.e.). Neither the monooxygenase nor peroxygenase pathways of the P450 demonstrated a significant kinetic isotope effect (KIE) for the oxidation of deuterated substrates. These new peroxygenase variants offer the possibility of simpler cytochrome P450 systems for selective oxidations. To demonstrate this, a light driven H  2  O  2  generating system was used to support efficient product formation with this peroxygenase enzyme.</dc:description>

         <title>Layered Oxide Cathodes Promoted by Crystal Regulation Strategies for Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Layered oxide cathodes have demonstrated great potential for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) on account of high reversible capacity, appropriate diffusion paths, and low cost. However, their electrochemical performance in PIBs is generally worse than that in lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to large structural changes and deformations during charging and discharging. To improve their potassium storage performance, a series of strategies have been developed in recent studies. In this review, we summarize the latest advancements in layered oxide cathodes for PIBs through different crystal regulation strategies, including transition metal layer doping, potassium content optimization, oxygen partial substitution, functional morphology construction and air stability improvement. Meanwhile, the relationship between the electrochemical properties and structural evolution of these modified cathodes is also investigated. In addition, the challenges and prospects of these layered oxide cathodes in PIBs are analyzed in detail, providing constructive insights for future applications of PIBs.</dc:description>
