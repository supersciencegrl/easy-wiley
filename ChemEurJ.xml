         <title>Elucidating the Excited State Behavior of Pyridyl Pyridinium Systems via Computational and Transient Absorption studies of Tetrahedral Multichromophoric Arrays and their Model Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The tetrahedral shape&#8208;persistent molecule&#160;14+, containing four identical pyridyl pyridinium units connected&#160;via&#160;a sp3hybridized carbon atom, has been investigated in detail by means of steady&#8208;state and time resolved spectroscopy. Remarkable photophysical properties are observed, particularly in comparison with protonated and methylated analogues (1H48+,&#160;1Me48+), which exhibit a substantially shorter excited state lifetimes and lower emission quantum yields. Theoretical studies have rationalized the behavior of the tetrameric molecules relative to the monomers, with DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations corroborating steady&#8208;state (absorption and emission) and transient absorption spectra. The behavior of the monomeric compounds (each consisting in one of the four identical subunits of the tetramers, i.e.,&#160;2+,&#160;2H2+&#160;and&#160;2Me2+) considerably differs from that of the tetramers, indicating a strong electronic interaction between the subunits in the tetrameric species, likely promoted by the homoconjugation through the connecting sp3&#160;C atom.&#160;2+&#160;is characterized by a peculiar S1&#8208;S2&#160;excited state inversion, whereas the short&#8208;lived emitting S1&#160;state of&#160;2H2+&#160;and&#160;2Me2+&#160;exhibits a partial charge&#8208;transfer character, as substantiated by spectro&#8208;electrochemical studies. Among the six investigated systems, only&#160;14+&#160;is a sizeable luminophore (Fem&#160;= 0.15), which is related to the peculiar features of its singlet state.</dc:description>

         <title>Organoselenium Compounds: Chemistry and Applications in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selenium, a crucial trace element for life, naturally occurs as selenocysteine. Its growing interest over the years is focused not only on the relevant pharmacological properties but also on its use in catalysis. From the point of view of drug developments, selenium&#8208;containing drugs are isosteres of sulfur and oxygen. Different aspects on its appealing chemistry are comprised in this Review article.







Abstract
Selenium, originally described as a toxin, turns out to be a crucial trace element for life that appears as selenocysteine and its dimer, selenocystine. From the point of view of drug developments, selenium&#8208;containing drugs are isosteres of sulfur and oxygen with the advantage that the presence of the selenium atom confers antioxidant properties and high lipophilicity, which would increase cell membrane permeation leading to better oral bioavailability. In this article, we have focused on the relevant features of the selenium atom, above all, the corresponding synthetic approaches to access a variety of organoselenium molecules along with the proposed reaction mechanisms. The preparation and biological properties of selenosugars, including selenoglycosides, selenonucleosides, selenopeptides, and other selenium&#8208;containing compounds will be treated. We have attempted to condense the most important aspects and interesting examples of the chemistry of selenium into a single article.

         <title>The s&#8208;p Nonhybrid Nature Causes Adaptive Superatomic States of Bismuth Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superatoms: The Bin+ clusters are found to be inert with common gases but react with NO, enabling us to screen out Bi7+ and Bi15+ for which we have fully unveiled their relative stability within unique bonding and s&#8208;p nonhybrid nature, indicating potentials of using such building blocks for functional materials.







Abstract
We report a joint experimental and theoretical study on the stability and reactivity of Bin+ (n=5&#8211;33) clusters. The alternating odd&#8208;even effect on the reaction rates of Bin+ clusters with NO is observed, and Bi7+ finds the most inertness. First&#8208;principles calculation results reveal that the lowest energy structures of Bi6&#8208;9+ exhibit quasi&#8208;spherical geometry pertaining to the jellium shell model; however, the Bin+ (n&#8805;10) clusters adopt assembly structures. The prominent stability of Bi7+ is associated with its highly symmetric structure and superatomic states with a magic number of 34e closed shell. For the first time, we demonstrate that the unique s&#8208;p nonhybrid feature in bismuth rationalizes the stability of Bi6&#8208;9+ clusters within the jellium model, by filling the 6s electrons into the superatomic orbitals (forming &#8220;s&#8208;band&#8221;). Interestingly, the stability of 18e &#8220;s&#8208;band&#8221; coincides with the compact structure for Bin+ at n&#8804;9 but assembly structures for n&#8805;10, showing an accommodation of the s electrons to the geometric structure. The atomic p&#8208;orbitals also allow to form superatomic orbitals at higher energy levels, contributing to the preferable structures of tridentate binding units. We illustrate the s&#8208;p nonhybrid nature accommodates the structure and superatomic states of bismuth clusters.

         <title>Cyaphide&#8208;Azide 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition Reactions: Scope and Applicability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of metal cyaphido compounds in 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reactions with azides to afford metallo&#8208;triazaphospholes is described. The reactions proceed straightforwardly, under mild conditions and in good yields, in a manner reminiscent of the classic alkyne&#8208;azide click reaction. The resulting metallo&#8208;triazaphospholes can be used as precursors to protio&#8208; and iodo&#8208;triazaphospholes.







Abstract
Several examples of the cyaphide&#8208;azide 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reaction to afford metallo&#8208;triazaphospholes are reported. The gold(I) triazaphospholes Au(IDipp)(CPN3R) (IDipp=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene; R=tBu, Ad, Dipp), magnesium(II) triazaphospholes, {Mg(DippNacNac)(CPN3R)}2 (DippNacNac=CH{C(CH3)N(Dipp)}2, Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl; R=tBu, Bn), and germanium(II) triazaphosphole Ge(DippNacNac)&#8208;(CPN3tBu) can be prepared straightforwardly, under mild conditions and in good yields, in a manner reminiscent of the classic alkyne&#8208;azide click reaction (albeit without a catalyst). This reactivity can be extended to compounds with two azide functional groups such as 1,3&#8208;diazidobenzene. It is shown that the resulting metallo&#8208;triazaphospholes can be used as precursors to carbon&#8208;functionalized species, including protio&#8208; and iodo&#8208;triazaphospholes.

         <title>A DFT Study of Imine Exchange Reactions in Iron(II)&#8208;Coordinated Pincers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The imine bond is among the most applied motifs in dynamic covalent chemistry. Although its uses are varied and often involve coordination to a transition metal for stability, mechanistic studies on imine exchange reactions so far have not included metal coordination. Herein, we investigated the condensation and transimination reactions of an Fe2+&#8208;coordinated diimine pyridine pincer, employing wB97XD/6&#8208;311G(2d,2p) DFT calculations in acetonitrile. We first experimentally confirmed that Fe2+ is strongly coordinated by these pincers, and is thus a justified model ion. When considering a four&#8208;membered ring&#8208;shaped transition state for proton transfers, the required activation energies for condensation and transimination reaction exceeded values expected for reactions known to be spontaneous at room temperature. The nature of the incoming and exiting amines and the substituents on the para&#8208;position of the pincer had no effect on this. Replacing Fe2+ with Zn2+ or removing it altogether did not reduce it either. However, addition of two ethylamine molecules lowered the energy barriers to be compatible with experiment (19.4 and 23.2 kcal/mol for condensation and transimination, respectively). Lastly, the energy barrier of condensation of a non&#8208;coordinated pincer was significantly higher than found for Fe2+&#8208;coordinating pincers, underlined the catalyzing effect of metal coordination on imine exchange reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>A Versatile Urea Type Linker for Functionalizing Natural Glycans and Its Validation in Glycan Arrays</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel linker for the functionalization of glycosylamines prepared from isolated N&#8208;glycans is described. The protected linked N&#8208;glycans could be easily purified and after deprotection, the primary amine generated serves as &#8220;anchor&#8221; in the preparation of glycan microarrays. The performance of the newly described linker is compared with 3 other linkers after incubation with lectins with known specificity.







Abstract
The isolation from organisms and readily available glycoproteins has become an increasingly convenient source of N&#8208;glycans for multiple applications including glycan microarrays, as reference standards in glycan analysis or as reagents that improve bioavailability of protein and peptide therapeutics through conjugation. A problematic step in the isolation process on a preparative scale can be the attachment of a linker for the improved purification, separation, immobilization and quantification of the glycan structures. Addressing this issue, we firstly aimed for the development of an UV active linker for a fast and reliable attachment to anomeric glycosylamines via urea bond formation. Secondly, we validated the new linker on glycan arrays in a comparative study with a collection of N&#8208;glycans which were screened against various lectins. In total, we coupled four structurally varied N&#8208;glycans to four different linkers, immobilized all constructs on a microarray and compared their binding affinities to four plant and fungal lectins of widely described specificity. Our study shows that the urea type linker showed an overall superior performance for lectin binding and once more, highlights the often neglected influence of the choice of linker on lectin recognition.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Chiral 2&#8208;Nitroallylic Amines via Cooperative Cation&#8208;Binding Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we present the use of cooperative cation&#8208;binding catalysis as an efficient method for synthesizing chiral allylic amines. By utilizing a chiral oligoEG and potassium fluoride as a cation&#8208;binding catalyst and base, respectively, a wide range of biologically relevant chiral 2&#8208;nitroallylic amines are obtained with excellent enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99&#8201;%&#8201;ee) through the organocatalytic asymmetric aza&#8208;Henry&#8208;like reaction of &#946;&#8208;monosubstituted and &#946;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted nitroalkenes with &#945;&#8208;amidosulfones as imine precursors. Preliminary use of a chiral 2&#8208;nitroallylic amine as a Michael acceptor demonstrated its potential application for diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of bioactive compounds.

Abstract
A set of ruthenium(II)&#8208;protic&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complexes, [Ru(NNCH)(PPh3)2(X)]Cl (1, X=Cl and 2, X=H) and their deprotonated forms [Ru(NNC)(PPh3)2(X)] (1&#8217;, X=Cl and 2&#8217;, X=H), in which NNC is a new unsymmetrical pincer ligand, are reported. The four complexes are interconvertible by simple acid&#8208;base chemistry. The combined theoretical and spectroscopic investigations indicate charge segregation in anionic&#8208;NHC complexes (1&#8217; and 2&#8217;) and can be described from a Lewis pair perspective. The chemical reactivity of deprotonated complex 1&#8217; shows cooperative small molecule activation. Complex 1&#8217; activates H&#8722;H bond of hydrogen, C(sp3)&#8208;I bond of iodomethane, and C(sp)&#8208;H bond of phenylacetylene. The activation of CO2 using anionic NHC complex 1&#8217; at moderate temperature and ambient pressure and subsequent conversion to formate is also described. All the new compounds have been characterized using ESI&#8208;MS, 1H, 13C, and 31P&#8197;NMR spectroscopy. Molecular structures of 1, 2, and 2&#8217; have also been determined with single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The cooperative small molecule activation perspective broadens the scope of potential applications of anionic&#8208;NHC complexes in small molecule activation, including the conversion of carbon dioxide to formate, a much sought after reaction in the renewable energy and sustainable development domains.

         <title>FP(&#956;&#8208;N)2S: A Sulfur&#8208;Pnictogen Four&#8208;Membered Ring with 6&#960; Electrons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 45, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An elusive 6&#960;&#8208;electron four&#8208;membered ring compound FP(&#956;&#8208;N)2S is prepared, and it can undergo ring&#8208;opening to the thiazyl isomer FPNSN upon irradiation at 550&#8197;nm. In sharp contrast to the square planar structure for the 6&#960;&#8208;electron analogue S2N2, FP(&#956;&#8208;N)2S displays a puckered structure with significant biradical character.







Abstract
The new 6&#960;&#8208;electron four&#8208;membered ring compound 3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;1&#955;2,2,4,3&#955;3&#8208;thiadiazaphosphetidine, FP(&#956;&#8208;N)2S, has been generated in the gas phase through high&#8208;vacuum flash pyrolysis (HVFP) of thiophosphoryl diazide, FP(S)(N3)2, at 1000&#8197;K. Subsequent isolation of FP(&#956;&#8208;N)2S in cryogenic matrices (Ar, Ne, and N2) allows its characterization with matrix&#8208;isolation IR and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy by combination with 15N&#8208;isotope labeling and computations at the CCSD(T)&#8208;F12a/VTZ&#8208;F12 level of theory. Upon visible&#8208;light irradiation at 550&#8197;nm, this cyclic compound undergoes ring&#8208;opening to the thiazyl isomer FPNSN, followed by dissociation to FP and SN2 under subsequent UV&#8208;irradiation at 365&#8197;nm. In sharp contrast to the square planar structure for the isolobal four&#8208;membered ring S2N2, a puckered structure with significant biradical character has been found for FP(&#956;&#8208;N)2S.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An elusive 6&#960;-electron four-membered ring compound&lt;/b&gt; FP(&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;-N)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S is prepared, and it can undergo ring-opening to the thiazyl isomer FPNSN upon irradiation at 550&#8197;nm.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Precise Dicationic Tetraboranes: Syntheses, Structures and Rearrangement to an Alkylidene Borate&#8208;Borenium Zwitterion and a 1,3&#8208;Azaborinine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 45, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of carbene&#8208;stabilized symmetrical and unsymmetrical dicationic tetraboranes were prepared and fully characterized. Reactions of these tetraboranes with reductants/bases afford a zwitterionic alkylidene borate&#8211;borenium species and a 1,3&#8208;azaborinine, respectively. The structural relationship of the alkylidene borate&#8211;borenium zwitterion and its zwitterionic diborene analogue was investigated.







Abstract
Carbene&#8208;stabilized symmetrical and unsymmetrical dicationic tetraboranes, featuring an electron&#8208;precise tetraborane chain, were synthesized and fully characterized. Reactions of these tetraboranes with reductants/bases give rise to different outcomes according to the conditions employed, including: 1) reduction and rearrangement of the tetraborane chain to give a zwitterionic alkylidene borate&#8211;borenium species; 2) cleavage of the tetraborane chain to afford a 1,3&#8208;azaborinine; and 3) reduction of the supporting ligands to provide a diamino dipotassium salt. The zwitterionic alkylidene borate&#8211;borenium species can be viewed as an analogue of the base&#8208;stabilized diborenes. NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations reveal a highly polarized B&#8722;B bond in the zwitterionic alkylidene borate&#8211;borenium, in which the formal oxidation states of the boron atoms can be considered as &#8722;1 and +2. These results suggest the considerable potential of tetraboranes as synthons for low&#8208;valent boron species.

         <title>Anthradithiophene (ADT)&#8208;Based Polymerized Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptors for All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 45, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable monomer called ADT, easily synthesized from cheap starting materials in high yield via simple filtration through basic alumina, was used as the electron&#8208;rich building block in polymerized non&#8208;fullerene molecular acceptors. ADT may serve as an electron&#8208;rich monomer for more green and scalable organic semiconductors.







Abstract
Realizing efficient all&#8208;polymer solar cell (APSC) acceptors typically involves increased building block synthetic complexity, hence potentially unscalable syntheses and/or prohibitive costs. Here we report the synthesis, characterization, and implementation in APSCs of three new polymer acceptors P1&#8211;P3 using a scalable donor fragment, bis(2&#8208;octyldodecyl)anthra[1,2&#8208;b&#8201;:&#8201;5,6&#8208;b&#8217;]dithiophene&#8208;4,10&#8208;dicarboxylate (ADT) co&#8208;polymerized with the high&#8208;efficiency acceptor units, NDI, Y6, and IDIC. All three copolymers have comparable photophysics to known polymers; however, APSCs fabricated by blending P1, P2 and P3 with donor polymers PM5 and PM6 exhibit modest power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), with the champion P2&#8208;based APSC achieving PCE=5.64&#8201;%. Detailed morphological and microstructural analysis by AFM and GIWAXS reveal a non&#8208;optimal APSC active layer morphology, which suppresses charge transport. Despite the modest efficiencies, these APSCs demonstrate the feasibility of using ADT as a scalable and inexpensive electron rich/donor building block for APSCs.

         <title>Spectroscopic and Computational Study of the Organocatalytic Umpolung of Bromocations: An Accelerated Stereoselective Dibromination Protocol
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 45, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A newly developed method towards the in&#8197;situ umpolung of cationic bromine from N&#8208;bromosuccinimide (NBS) using an amine organocatalyst is reported. The intermediate reagents and their reactivity have well been characterised by spectroscopic and computational methods. Strategic structural change in the NBS molecule can cause sufficient polarity reversal to accelerate the dibromination reaction needing both &#8220;Br&#8221; synthons. This has further been utilised in an accelerated dibromination reaction of olefins with a broad substrate scope.







Abstract
Herein, organocatalytically achieved polarity reversal of cationic bromine is presented. The proven bromocation source N&#8208;bromosuccinimide (NBS) was converted to a superior bromoanion reagent by H/Br exchange with a secondary amine, substantiated with spectroscopic and computational evidence. The concept has further been used in a successfully accelerated organocatalyzed dibromination of olefins in a non&#8208;hazardous, commercially viable process with a wide range of substrate scope. The reactivity of key entities observed through NMR kinetics and reaction acceleration using only 10&#8197;mol&#8201;% of catalyst account for its major success. The nucleophilicity of the bromoanion was found to be superior in comparison to other nucleophiles such as MeOH and H2O also the protocol dominates over the competing allylic bromination reaction.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Double Oxidation Synthesis of N&#8208;1&#8208;Piperidonyl Amides From N&#8208;1&#8208;Piperidinyl Amides with meta&#8208;Chloroperbenzoic Acid: Rimonabant Analogue as Model Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 45, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;1&#8208;Piperidonyl amides were firstly oxidized by mCPBA from N&#8208;1&#8208;piperidinyl amides. The new developed method was also extended to Rimonabant analogue, N&#8208;(piperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;1H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxamide, and N&#8208;(azepan&#8208;1&#8208;yl)benzamide, especially for Rimonabant analogue. This work presented a significant advancement in the synthesis of oxidized N&#8208;1&#8208;piperidonyl amides that had important implications for the further development of potential drugs and the study of the oxidized metabolite.







Abstract
A simple and efficient one&#8208;pot oxidation synthesis of N&#8208;1&#8208;piperidonyl amides was successfully developed through the double oxidation of hydrazides (involving hydrazonium formation, azodioxy&#8208;carbonyl compounds generation, and &#945;&#8208;carbon oxidation) by using meta&#8208;chloroperbenzoic acid (mCPBA). The convenient oxidation method was also extended to Rimonabant analogue.

     alt="One-Pot Double Oxidation Synthesis of N-1-Piperidonyl Amides From N-1-Piperidinyl Amides with meta-Chloroperbenzoic Acid: Rimonabant Analogue as Model Study"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-1-Piperidonyl amides were firstly oxidized by &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;CPBA from &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-1-piperidinyl amides. The new developed method was also extended to Rimonabant analogue, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-(piperidin-1-yl)-1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide, and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-(azepan-1-yl)benzamide, especially for Rimonabant analogue. This work presented a significant advancement in the synthesis of oxidized &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-1-piperidonyl amides that had important implications for the further development of potential drugs and the study of the oxidized metabolite.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple and efficient one-pot oxidation synthesis of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-1-piperidonyl amides was successfully developed through the double oxidation of hydrazides (involving hydrazonium formation, azodioxy-carbonyl compounds generation, and &#945;-carbon oxidation) by using &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;-chloroperbenzoic acid (&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;CPBA). The convenient oxidation method was also extended to Rimonabant analogue. The lactam oxidized Rimonabant analogue was first successfully synthesized for demonstrating the construction and characterized by NMR spectroscopic methods and the single-crystal X-ray diffraction study (ORTEP).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Role of the Amino Acid Molecular Characteristics on the Formation of Fluorescent Gold&#8208; and Silver&#8208;Based Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 45, August 10, 2023. </description>

Fluorescent gold and silver nanoclusters: Formation of few&#8208;atomic (5&#8211;7 atoms) metallic nanoclusters having molecular&#8208;like behaviour and intense fluorescence features is confirmed for Phe, Arg and Gln amino acids. Relatively high QY% (&#8764;18&#8201;%) was obtained for Arg&#8208;AuNCs which is outstanding value among the small molecule&#8208;stabilized Au NCs published in the literature so far.







Abstract
Role of amino acids like L&#8208;phenylalanine (Phe), L&#8208;glutamine (Gln) and L&#8208;arginine (Arg) is described and interpreted in terms of their potential for preparation of fluorescent molecular&#8208;like gold and silver nanostructures. We are among the first to demonstrate the effect of syntheses conditions as well as the molecular characteristics of Phe, Gln and Arg amino acids on the structure of the formed products. Comprehensive optical characterizations (lifetime, quantum yield (QY%)) of the blue&#8208;emitting products were also carried out. It was confirmed that for all Au&#8208;containing samples and for Gln&#8208;Ag system the characteristic fluorescence originates from few&#8208;atomic metallic nanoclusters (NCs) where the reduction of metal ions was promoted by citrate in some cases. Relatively high QY% (&#8764;18&#8201;%) was obtained for Arg&#8208;stabilized Au NCs due to the existence of an electrostatic interaction between the electron rich, positively charged guanidium side chain of Arg and the negatively charged carboxylate group of citrate on the metallic surface. Size and structural analysis of the products were evaluated by infrared measurements and dynamic light scattering techniques.

         <title>Capture and Stabilization of the Hydroxyl Radical in a Uranyl Peroxide Cluster
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 45, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A uranyl peroxide cluster has been synthesized that is capable of stabilizing the hydroxyl radical for more than a week in both solution and the solid state. The cluster has been structurally and spectroscopically characterized including with deuterated materials, which indicate the origin of the free radicals is from the breakdown of H2O2, and this demonstrates that radiolysis products in spent nuclear fuel may interact with actinide species.







Abstract
Here we describe the synthesis and characterization of a new uranyl peroxide cluster (UPC), U60Ox30*, which captures and stabilizes oxygen&#8208;based free radicals for more than one week. These radical species were first detected with a nitroblue tetrazolium colorimetric assay and U60Ox30* was characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction as well as infrared (IR), Raman, UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR, and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopies. Identification of the free radicals present in U60Ox30* was done via room temperature solid and solution state X&#8208;band EPR studies using spin trapping methods. The spin trapping agent 5,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1&#8208;pyrroline N&#8208;oxide (DMPO) was definitive for identifying the free radicals in U60Ox30*, which are hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) that are stable for up to ten days that also persist upon addition of the metalloenzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase. Addition of the spin trapping agent &#945;&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridyl N&#8208;oxide)&#8208;N&#8208;tert&#8208;butylnitrone (POBN) further confirmed the radicals were oxygen based, and deuteration experiments showed that the origin of the free radicals was from the decomposition of H2O2 in water. These results demonstrate that highly oxidizing species such as the &#8901;OH radical can be stabilized in UPCs, which alters our understanding of the role of free radicals present in spent nuclear fuel.

Intramolecular iodolactonization was employed for the efficient and stereoselective conversion of an sTCO click&#8208;conjugation precursor to a highly reactive and stable click&#8208;cleavable sTCO antibody conjugate linker.







Abstract
An increase in the click&#8208;to&#8208;release reaction rate between cleavable trans&#8208;cyclooctenes (TCO) and tetrazines would be beneficial for drug delivery applications. In this work, we have developed a short and stereoselective synthesis route towards highly reactive sTCOs that serve as cleavable linkers, affording quantitative tetrazine&#8208;triggered payload release. In addition, the fivefold more reactive sTCO exhibited the same in&#8197;vivo stability as current TCO linkers when used as antibody linkers in circulation in mice.

One cleavage &#8208; many possibilities: A straightforward one&#8208;pot synthesis of enantiopure P&#8208;chiral 1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophospholes has been established via a nucleophilic P&#8722;N bond cleavage of 1&#8208;phospha&#8208;2&#8208;azanorbornene (PAN). The procedure can be modified to give &#8220;custom&#8208;made&#8221; ligands by selecting various nucleophiles and PAN derivatives to control the steric and electronic properties. Phosphorus(III) compounds derived from this procedure are expected to be effective ligands in asymmetric homogeneous catalysis.







Abstract
The reactive P&#8722;N bond in a racemic mixture of endo&#8208;1&#8208;phospha&#8208;2&#8208;azanorbornene (PAN) (RP/SP)&#8208;endo&#8208;1 is readily cleaved with enantiomerically pure lithium alkoxides followed by protonation to afford diastereomeric mixtures of P&#8208;chiral 1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophosphole derivatives. The isolation of these compounds is rather challenging due to the reversibility of the reaction (elimination of alcohols). However, methylation of the sulfonamide moiety of the intermediate lithium salts and sulfur protection of the phosphorus atom prevent the elimination reaction. The resulting air&#8208;stable P&#8208;chiral diastereomeric 1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophosphole sulfide mixtures can be readily isolated and fully characterized. The diastereomers can be separated by crystallization. The 1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophosphole sulfides are readily reduced with Raney nickel to afford phosphorus(III) P&#8208;stereogenic 1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophospholes with potential use in asymmetric homogeneous transition metal catalysis.

However, methylation of the sulfonamide moiety of the intermediate lithium salts and sulfur protection of the phosphorus atom prevent the elimination reaction. The resulting air-stable &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;-chiral diastereomeric 1-alkoxy-2,3-dihydrophosphole sulfide mixtures can be readily isolated and fully characterized. The diastereomers can be separated by crystallization. The 1-alkoxy-2,3-dihydrophosphole sulfides are readily reduced with Raney nickel to afford phosphorus(III) &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;-stereogenic 1-alkoxy-2,3-dihydrophospholes with potential use in asymmetric homogeneous transition metal catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Strong Chiroptical Effects in the Absorption and Emission of Macrocycles Based on the 2,5&#8208;Diaminoterephthalate Minimal Fluorophore</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 45, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple one&#8208;pot reaction produces chiral macrocycles consisting of repeatable units of dimethyl 2,5&#8208;diaminoterephthalate (n=2&#8211;4). The products fluoresce in solution and the solid state at wavelengths that are dependent on the size of the macrocyclic ring. ECD and CPL spectra reveal high chiroptical activity in the red range, despite their small chromophores.







Abstract
Chiral fluorescent macrocycles consisting of two to four units of dimethyl 2,5&#8208;diaminoterephthalate can be readily synthesized in a one&#8208;pot manner from inexpensive building blocks. Depending on the concentration, either a paracyclophane&#8208;like dimer with closely stacked benzene rings or a triangular trimer is the main product of the reaction. The macrocycles exhibit fluorescence in solution as well as in the solid state with maxima that are red&#8208;shifted with decreasing size of the macrocyclic ring and are observed at wavelengths from 590 (tetramer in solution) to 700&#8197;nm (dimer in the solid state). Chirality dictates the differential absorption and emission of circularly polarized light by these molecules. The ECD and CPL effects are particularly strong for the trimer, which is characterized by relatively large dissymmetry factors gabs=&#177;2.8&#215;10&#8722;3 at 531&#8197;nm and glum=&#177;2.3&#215;10&#8722;3 at 580&#8197;nm in n&#8208;hexane, being at the same time highly luminescent (&#934;fl=13.7&#8201;%). Despite the small chromophore, the circularly polarized brightness BCPL of 2.3&#8197;dm3&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 is comparable to values reported for other classes of established CPL emitters in the visible region, such as expanded helicenes or larger &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Sub&#8208;Nanochannels Formed inside Solid&#8208;State Nanopore with Proton Ultra&#8208;High Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 45, August 10, 2023. </description>

UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(NH2)2 and UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(NH&#8208;SAG)2 were grown in&#8197;situ within the pores of quartz nanopores for super&#8208;selective proton transport. When the UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(NH&#8208;SAG)2 nanopores are prepared by further post&#8208;modification with sulfo&#8208;acetic acid, it is difficult for lithium ions to pass through the channels, but the protons can facilitate the transport of protons, resulting in ultrahigh selectivity for protons.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;Organic frameworks (MOFs) have the advantages of high porosity, angstrom&#8208;scale pore size, and unique structure. In this work, a kind of MOFs, UiO&#8208;66 and its derivatives (including aminated UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(NH2)2 and sulfonated UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(NH&#8208;SAG)2), were constructed on the inner surface of solid&#8208;state nanopores for ultra&#8208;selective proton transport. UiO&#8208;66 and UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(NH2)2 nanocrystal particles were in&#8208;situ grown at the orifice of glass nanopores firstly, which were used to investigate the ionic current responses in LiCl and HCl solutions when the monovalent anions (Cl&#8722;) were unchanged. Compared with UiO&#8208;66&#8208;modifed nanopores, the aminated MOFs modification (UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(NH2)2) can improve the proton selectivity obviously. However, when the UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(NH&#8208;SAG)2 nanopore is prepared by further post&#8208;modification with sulfo&#8208;acetic acid, lithium ions can hardly pass through the channel, and the interaction between protons and sulfonic acid groups can promote the transport of protons, thus achieving ultra&#8208;high selectivity to protons. This work provides a new way to achieve sub&#8208;nanochannels with high selectivity, which can widely be used in ion separation, sensing and energy conversion.

         <title>Novel Method for the Synthesis of Merocyanines: New Photophysical Possibilities for a Known Class of Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 45, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction followed by nucleophilic aromatic substitution enables the assembly of rhodols and novel strongly emitting merocyanines from simple substrates.







Abstract
A new, transformative method for the preparation of rhodols and other merocyanines from readily available tetrafluorohydroxybenzaldehyde and aminophenols has been developed. It is now possible to prepare merocyanines bearing three fluorine atoms and additional conjugated rings, and the whole one&#8208;pot process occurs under neutral, mild conditions. Three heretofore unknown merocyanine&#8208;based architectures were prepared using this strategy from aminonaphthols and 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarins. The ability to change the structure of original rhodol chromophore into &#960;&#8208;expanded merocyanines translates to a comprehensive method for the modulation of photophysical properties, such as shifting the absorption and emission bands across almost the entire visible spectrum, reaching a huge Stokes shift i.&#8201;e. 4800&#8197;cm&#8722;1, brightness approximately 80.000&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8197;cm&#8722;1, two&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;section above 150&#8197;GM and switching&#8208;on/off solvatofluorochromism. A detailed investigation allowed to rationalize the different spectroscopic behavior of rhodols and new merocyanines, addressing solvatochromism and two&#8208;photon absorption.

         <title>Kinetically Controlled Star Copolymer Self&#8208;Assembly for Rapid Fabrication of Nanoparticles with High Encapsulation Capacity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 45, August 10, 2023. </description>

Rapid and scalable self&#8208;assembly of an amphiphilic 21&#8208;arm star copolymer results in nanoparticles with narrow&#8208;size distribution and capability of high hydrophobic cargo encapsulation up to 19.84&#8201;%. A kinetically controlled self&#8208;assembly mechanism has been proposed for this process.







Abstract
Rapid and scalable self&#8208;assembly of an amphiphilic 21&#8208;arm star copolymer, (polystyrene&#8208;block&#8208;polyethylene glycol)21 [(PS&#8208;b&#8208;PEG)21] in aqueous solution has been performed by reverse solvent exchange procedure. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) reveal the formation of nanoparticles with narrow size distribution. Further investigation indicates a kinetically controlled self&#8208;assembly mechanism of the copolymers, in which the star topology of the amphiphilic copolymer and deep quenching condition by reverse solvent exchange are key to accelerate intrachain contraction of the copolymer during phase separation. When interchain contraction dominant over interchain association, nanoparticles with low aggregation number could be formed. Thanks to the high hydrophobic contents of the (PS&#8208;b&#8208;PEG)21 polymers, the resulted nanoparticles could encapsulate a high capacity of hydrophobic cargo up to 19.84&#8201;%. The kinetically controlled star copolymer self&#8208;assembly process reported here provides a platform for the rapid and scalable fabrication of nanoparticle with high drug loading capacity (LC), which may find broad range of applications in, for example drug delivery, nanopesticide.

Transmission electron microscope (TEM) and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) reveal the formation of nanoparticles with narrow size distribution. Further investigation indicates a kinetically controlled self-assembly mechanism of the copolymers, in which the star topology of the amphiphilic copolymer and deep quenching condition by reverse solvent exchange are key to accelerate intrachain contraction of the copolymer during phase separation. When interchain contraction dominant over interchain association, nanoparticles with low aggregation number could be formed. Thanks to the high hydrophobic contents of the (PS-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;-PEG)&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; polymers, the resulted nanoparticles could encapsulate a high capacity of hydrophobic cargo up to 19.84&#8201;%. The kinetically controlled star copolymer self-assembly process reported here provides a platform for the rapid and scalable fabrication of nanoparticle with high drug loading capacity (LC), which may find broad range of applications in, for example drug delivery, nanopesticide.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The first crystal structure of the metastable hexalacunary Wells&#8208;Dawson [&#945;&#8208;H2P2W12O48]12&#8722; ({P2W12}). By using a proper combination of counter cations, the anion selectively transforms into a {WO(OH2)}4+&#8208;bridged Pacman&#8208;shaped [{WO(OH2)}(&#945;&#8208;HP2W12O48)2]22&#8722; ({P4W25}) dimer or a cyclic [{WO(OH2)}3(P2W12O48)3]30&#8722; ({P6W39}) trimer without coordination to transition metal cations.







Abstract
We report the first single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structural evidence of the potassium salt of the hexalacunary [&#945;&#8208;H2P2W12O48]12&#8722; (abbreviated as {P2W12}) anion after its discovery by Contant and Ciabrini in 1977. In addition, we observed oligomerization of {P2W12} into a {WO(OH2)}4+&#8208;bridged Pacman&#8208;shaped [{WO(OH2)}(&#945;&#8208;HP2W12O48)2]22&#8722; ({P4W25}) dimer and a cyclic [{WO(OH2)}3(P2W12O48)3]30&#8722; ({P6W39}) trimer. The three phosphotungstate anions were synthesized through recrystallization of (NH4)12[&#945;&#8208;H2P2W12O48] from slightly alkaline (HOCH2)3CNH2/KCl, CH3NH3Cl/KCl, and CH3NH3Cl/NH4Cl solutions. The structure of {P2W12} is derived from [&#945;&#8208;P2W18O62]6&#8722; that has six tungsten atoms one from each polar group and four from the belt&#8211;removed, and the center of the lacunary site is capped by a potassium cation. Structures of {P4W25} and {P6W39} are constructed by connecting two and three {P2W12} units with {WO(OH2)}4+, respectively. The isolation of a pure {P6W39} phosphotungstate framework without coordination with transition metal cations is unprecedented. Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction confirmed the bulk purity of these compounds, indicating that selective crystallization was achieved through the selection of countercations and pH.

         <title>2&#8208;Silylated Dihydroquinazolinone as a Photocatalytic Energy Transfer Enabled Radical Hydrosilylation Reagent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 45, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The successful development of a photoinduced silyl radical addition reaction by using 2&#8208;silylated dihydroquinazolinone as a silyl radical precursor is presented. Hydrosilylation of electron&#8208;deficient alkene and styrene substrates resulted in addition products in good to high yield. The herein discussed energy transfer type silyl radical precursors will be suitable for hydrosilylation reactions as well as further radical addition reactions.







Abstract
The hydrosilylation of alkenes is one of the most important methods for the synthesis of organosilicon compounds. In addition to the platinum&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation, silyl radical addition reactions are notable as economic reactions. An efficient and widely applicable silyl radical addition reaction was developed by using 2&#8208;silylated dihydroquinazolinone derivatives under photocatalytic conditions. Electron&#8208;deficient alkenes and styrene derivatives underwent hydrosilylation to give addition products in good to high yields. Mechanistic studies indicated that the photocatalyst functioned not as a photoredox catalyst but as an energy transfer catalyst. DFT calculations clarified that the triplet excited state of 2&#8208;silylated dihydroquinazolinone derivatives released a silyl radical through the homolytic cleavage of a carbon&#8208;silicon bond, and this was followed by the hydrogen atom transfer pathway, not the redox pathway.

         <title>Improved Luminous Efficiency of AgInS2 Quantum Dots and Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework&#8208;70 Composite for White Light Emitting Diode Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 45, August 10, 2023. </description>

AgInS2 quantum dots (AIS QDs) are successfully introduced into the ZIF&#8208;70 framework via microwave assisted&#8208;hydrothermal method. The ZIF&#8208;70 matrix is beneficial to prevent the quenching of QDs and increase the luminous efficiency of QDs&#8208;based WLED from 5.44&#8197;lm/W to 36.76&#8197;lm/W.







Abstract
The application of multiple quantum dots (QDs) in the field of white light emitting diodes (WLEDs) is still an important challenge due to their low luminous efficiency and quenching phenomenon. In this paper, we prepared AgInS2 QDs/zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;70 (AIS/ZIF&#8208;70) composite by a microwave hydrothermal method. Owing to the high porosity and stability of ZIF&#8208;70, it could effectively prevent quenching issues due to the aggregation of QDs. Since the ZIF&#8208;70 and QDs were chemically bonded, the formation of the ZnS layer could effectively passivate the surface defect and thus the quantum yield reached 21.49&#8201;% in aqueous solution. The luminous efficiency (LE) of the assembled AIS/ZIF&#8208;based WLED was reinforced by 6.8&#8197;times with a molar ratio of AgIn/Zn=18, i.&#8201;e. at 5.26&#8201;% molar fraction of ZIF&#8208;70. Moreover, the color rendering index (CRI) and correlated color temperature (CCT) of AIS/ZIF&#8208;based WLED were 84.3 and 3631&#8197;K, respectively, indicating its potential application in solid&#8208;state lighting.

         <title>Hantzsch Ester as Efficient and Economical NAD(P)H Mimic for In Vitro Bioredox Reactions</title>

Chemically stable Hantzsch ester is discovered to be an efficient and economical NAD(P)H mimic as sacrificial electron source in in&#8197;vitro bioconversions.







Abstract
Biocatalysis has emerged as a valuable and reliable tool for industrial and academic societies, particularly in fields related to bioredox reactions. The cost of cofactors, especially those needed to be replenished at stoichiometric amounts or more, is the chief economic concern for bioredox reactions. In this study, a readily accessible, inexpensive, and bench&#8208;stable Hantzsch ester is verified as the viable and efficient NAD(P)H mimic by four enzymatic redox transformations, including two non&#8208;heme diiron N&#8208;oxygenases and two flavin&#8208;dependent reductases. This finding provides the potential to significantly reduce the costs of NAD(P)H&#8208;relying bioredox reactions.

         <title>The Bulk Breast Cancer Cell and Breast Cancer Stem Cell Activity of Binuclear Copper(II)&#8208;Phenanthroline Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 45, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigations of the anti&#8208;cancer stem cell (CSC) properties of multinuclear metal complexes are rare. Here the synthesis, characterisation, and bulk breast cancer cell and breast CSC activity of two new binuclear copper(II) complexes are reported. The mechanism of action of the most stable and potent binuclear copper(II) complex were elucidated.







Abstract
Mononuclear copper(II)&#8208;phenanthroline complexes have been widely investigated as anticancer agents whereas multinuclear copper(II)&#8208;phenanthroline complexes are underexplored. Here the synthesis and characterisation of two new binuclear copper(II)&#8208;phenanthroline complexes 1 and 2 is reported, comprising of 2,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline or 2,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4,7&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, terminal chloride ligands, and bridging chloride or hydroxide ligands. The binuclear copper(II) complex containing 2,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline 1 displays nanomolar toxicity towards bulk breast cancer cells and breast cancer stem cells (CSCs) grown in monolayers, &gt;50&#8208;fold greater than cisplatin (an anticancer metallodrug) and salinomycin (a gold&#8208;standard anti&#8208;CSC agent). Spectacularly, 1 exhibits &gt;100&#8208;fold greater potency toward three&#8208;dimensionally cultured mammospheres than cisplatin and salinomycin. Mechanistic studies show that 1 evokes breast CSC apoptosis by elevating intracellular reactive oxygen species levels and damaging genomic DNA (possibly by an oxidative mechanism). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to probe the anti&#8208;breast CSC properties of binuclear copper(II)&#8208;phenanthroline complexes.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Mediated C&#8722;H Functionalization of Unactivated Alkynes for the Synthesis of Derivatized Dihydropyrrolones: Regioselectivity Under Thermodynamic Control</title>

Cyclopentadienyliron species mediate propargylic C&#8722;H functionalization of simple, unactivated alkynes for the synthesis of densely substituted and diversely functionalized dihydropyrrolones. High regioselectivities are observed under conditions of thermodynamic control.







Abstract
Cyclopentadienyliron dicarbonyl&#8208;based complexes present opportunities for underexplored disconnections in synthesis. Access to challenging dihydropyrrolone products is achieved by propargylic C&#8722;H functionalization of alkynes for the formation of cyclic organoiron species. Excellent regioselectivity for unsymmetrical alkynes is observed in many cases. Notably, regioselectivity under these stoichiometric conditions diverges from those observed previously under catalysis, occurring at the more&#8208;substituted terminus of the alkyne, allowing for methine functionalization and the formation of quaternary centers. Divergent demetallation of the intermediate organoiron complexes gives access to chemically diverse products which are amenable to further functionalization.

         <title>Tuning the Polarity of Antibiotic&#8208;Cy5 Conjugates Enables Highly Selective Labeling of Binding Sites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 45, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic study on 13 new antibiotic&#8208;Cy5 dye conjugates derived from ampicillin, erythromycin, trimethoprim, and vancomycin revealed that in particular the incorporation of Cy5 dyes of low polarity leads to significantly improved properties regarding photostability, optical brightness, and distinctiveness. In turn, the related conjugates could be identified as outstanding tools for a variety of studies including fluorescence and super&#8208;resolution spectroscopy, differentiation of Gram+/&#8208; bacteria and competition binding.







Abstract
Multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria pose a major threat to global health, even as newly introduced antibiotics continue to lose their therapeutic value. Against this background, deeper insights into bacterial interaction with antibiotic drugs are urgently required, whereas fluorescently labeled drug conjugates can serve as highly valuable tools. Herein, the preparation and biological evaluation of 13&#8197;new fluorescent antibiotic&#8208;Cy5 dye conjugates is described, in which the tuning of the polarity of the Cy5 dye proved to be a key element to achieve highly favorable properties for various fields of application.

         <title>Regulating Magnetic Relaxations of Cyano&#8208;Bridged {DyIIIMoV} Systems by Tuning the N&#8208;Sites in &#946;&#8208;Diketone Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 45, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four cyano&#8208;bridged {DyIIIMoV} complexes 1&#8211;4, consisting of DyIII ions, &#946;&#8208;diketone (HLn: n=1, 2, 3, 4) ligands, and [Mo(CN)8]3&#8722;, are obtained by adjusting the N&#8208;sites of &#946;&#8208;diketone ligands. Their magnetic properties are highly dependent on the magnetic axis and magnetic anisotropy of the DyIII centers, which can be regulated by different coordination environments (DyOnN(8&#8208;n): n=5, 6, 7) of the DyIII centers.







Abstract
Cyano&#8208;bridged 4d&#8211;4f molecular nanomagnets have re&#8208;called increasing research interests in molecular magnetism since they offer more possibilities in achieving novel nanomagnets with versatile structures and magnetic interactions. In this work, four &#946;&#8208;diketone ligands bearing different substitution N&#8208;sites were designed and synthesized, namely 1&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;3&#8208;(3&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;propanedione (HL1), 1,3&#8208;Bis (3&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;propanedione (HL2), 1&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;3&#8208;(3&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;propanedione (HL3), and 1,3&#8208;Bis (4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;propanedione (HL4), to tune the magnetic relaxation behaviors of cyano&#8208;bridged {DyIIIMoV} systems. By reacting with DyCl3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6H2O and K4Mo(CN)8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O, four cyano&#8208;bridged complexes, namely {[Dy[MoV(CN)8](HL1)2(H2O)3]}&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6H2O (1), {[Dy[MoV(CN)8](HL2)(H2O)3(CH3OH)]}2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2CH3OH&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H2O (2), {[Dy[MoV(CN)8](HL3)(H2O)2(CH3OH)]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O}n (3), and {[Dy[MoV(CN)8](HL4)2(H2O)3]} &#8901;&#8201;2H2O&#8901;CH3OH (4) were obtained. Structural analyses revealed that 1 and 4 are binuclear complexes, 2 has a tetragonal structure, and 3 exhibits a stair&#8208;like polymer chain structure. The DyIII ions in all complexes have eight&#8208;coordinated configurations with the coordination spheres DyO7N1 for 1 and 4, DyO6N2 for 2, and DyO5N3 for 3. Magnetic measurements indicate that 1 is a zero&#8208;field single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) and complexes 2&#8211;4 are field&#8208;induced SMMs, with complex 4 featuring a two&#8208;step relaxation process. The magnetic characterizations and ab initio calculations revealed that changing the N&#8208;sites in the &#946;&#8208;diketone ligands can effectively alter the structures and magnetic properties of cyano&#8208;bridged 4d&#8211;4f nanomagnets by adjusting the coordination environments of the DyIII centers.

Their magnetic properties are highly dependent on the magnetic axis and magnetic anisotropy of the Dy&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; centers, which can be regulated by different coordination environments (DyO&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;(8-n)&lt;/sub&gt;: n=5, 6, 7) of the Dy&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; centers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyano-bridged 4d&#8211;4f molecular nanomagnets have re-called increasing research interests in molecular magnetism since they offer more possibilities in achieving novel nanomagnets with versatile structures and magnetic interactions. In this work, four &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-diketone ligands bearing different substitution N-sites were designed and synthesized, namely 1-(2-pyridyl)-3-(3-pyridyl)-1,3-propanedione (HL&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;), 1,3-Bis (3-pyridyl)-1,3-propanedione (HL&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), 1-(4-pyridyl)-3-(3-pyridyl)-1,3-propanedione (HL&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), and 1,3-Bis (4-pyridyl)-1,3-propanedione (HL&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;), to tune the magnetic relaxation behaviors of cyano-bridged {Dy&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;Mo&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;} systems. By reacting with DyCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and K&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Mo(CN)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, four cyano-bridged complexes, namely {[Dy[Mo&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;(CN)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;](HL&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]}&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), {[Dy[Mo&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;(CN)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;](HL&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH)]}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), {[Dy[Mo&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;(CN)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;](HL&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH)]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O}&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;), and {[Dy[Mo&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;(CN)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;](HL&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]} &#8901;&#8201;2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&#8901;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;) were obtained. Structural analyses revealed that &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; are binuclear complexes, &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; has a tetragonal structure, and &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; exhibits a stair-like polymer chain structure. The Dy&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; ions in all complexes have eight-coordinated configurations with the coordination spheres DyO&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; for &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;, DyO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, and DyO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; for &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;. Magnetic measurements indicate that &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; is a zero-field single-molecule magnet (SMM) and complexes &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; are field-induced SMMs, with complex &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; featuring a two-step relaxation process. The magnetic characterizations and &lt;i&gt;ab initio&lt;/i&gt; calculations revealed that changing the N-sites in the &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-diketone ligands can effectively alter the structures and magnetic properties of cyano-bridged 4d&#8211;4f nanomagnets by adjusting the coordination environments of the Dy&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; centers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photochemical Aminochlorination of Alkenes without the Use of an External Catalyst</title>

Photochemical aminochlorination of alkenes: Appropriate tuning of the irradiation wavelength leads to a mild photochemical protocol for the aminochlorination of alkenes, bypassing the need of an external photocatalyst or the use of the more labile N&#8722;I or N&#8722;Br starting materials for the 1,2&#8208;aminohalogenation reactions.







Abstract
The niche field of photochemistry offers opportunities that are not found in &#8220;traditional&#8221; ground state chemical pathways. Aminochlorinated derivatives are an interesting family of 1,2&#8208;difunctionalised compounds that provide access to a variety of natural products and pharmaceutical active substances. A practical, catalyst&#8208;free chloroamination protocol is described herein, providing access to intermediates of great importance, utilising mild and photochemical reaction conditions (370&#8197;nm), where N&#8208;chlorosulfonamides are used as both nitrogen and chlorine sources. A wide variety of olefins, decorated with a plethora of functional groups, was tested providing excellent results (28&#8197;examples, 18&#8211;88&#8201;% yield). Mechanistic studies (UV&#8208;Vis, control experiments and quantum yield measurement) were also performed.

         <title>Cyanine&#8208; and Rhodamine&#8208;Derived Alkynes for the Selective Targeting of Cancerous Mitochondria through Radical Thiol&#8208;Yne Coupling in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 45, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By exploiting the combined effects of structure&#8208;induced accumulation and stimuli&#8208;responsive reactivity, cancerous mitochondria were selectively targeted by using cyanine&#8208;aryl acetylene conjugates. Covalent fixation of the conjugates, which is promoted by elevated pH and ROS levels in cancerous mitochondria, occurs through radical thiol&#8208;yne coupling, although no radical&#8208;based mechanism had previously been observed in live cells.







Abstract
Despite their long history and their synthetic potential underlined by various recent advances, radical thiol&#8208;yne coupling reactions have so far only rarely been exploited for the functionalization of biomolecules, and no examples yet exist for their application in live cells &#8208; although natural thiols show widespread occurrence therein. By taking advantage of the particular cellular conditions of mitochondria in cancer cells, we have demonstrated that radical thiol&#8208;yne coupling represents a powerful reaction principle for the selective targeting of these organelles. Within our studies, fluorescently labeled reactive alkyne probes were investigated, for which the fluorescent moiety was chosen to enable both mitochondria accumulation as well as highly sensitive detection. After preliminary studies under cell&#8208;free conditions, the most promising alkyne&#8208;dye conjugates were evaluated in various cellular experiments comprising analysis by flow cytometry and microscopy. All in all, these results pave the way for improved future therapeutic strategies relying on live&#8208;cell compatibility and selectivity among cellular compartments.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Solid&#8208;State Polymer Electrolyte in Li&#8208;LiFePO4, Li&#8208;S and Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>

A new electrolyte membrane based on crystalline poly(ethylene glycol)dimethyl ether (PEGDME) allows the development of efficient, safe and high&#8208;energy lithium metal solid&#8208;polymer batteries with different cathodes, including LiFePO4, sulfur or oxygen operating at room temperature.







Abstract
A solid polymer electrolyte has been developed and employed in lithium&#8208;metal batteries of relevant interest. The material includes crystalline poly(ethylene glycol)dimethyl ether (PEGDME), LiTFSI and LiNO3 salts, and a SiO2 ceramic filler. The electrolyte shows ionic conductivity more than 10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature and approaching 10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 60&#8201;&#176;C, a Li+&#8208;transference number exceeding 0.3, electrochemical stability from 0 to 4.4&#8197;V vs. Li+/Li, lithium stripping/deposition overvoltage below 0.08&#8197;V, and electrode/electrolyte interphase resistance of 400&#8197;&#937;. Thermogravimetry indicates that the electrolyte stands up to 200&#8201;&#176;C without significant weight loss, while FTIR spectroscopy suggests that the LiTFSI conducting salt dissolves in the polymer. The electrolyte is used in solid&#8208;state cells with various cathodes, including LiFePO4 olivine exploiting the Li&#8208;insertion, sulfur&#8211;carbon composite operating through Li conversion, and an oxygen electrode in which reduction and evolution reactions (i.&#8201;e., ORR/OER) evolve on a carbon&#8208;coated gas diffusion layer (GDL). The cells operate reversibly at room temperature with a capacity of 140&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 3.4&#8197;V for LiFePO4, 400&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2&#8197;V for sulfur electrode, and 500&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2.5&#8197;V for oxygen. The results suggest that the electrolyte could be applied in room&#8208;temperature solid polymer cells.

         <title>Picolinaldehyde&#8208;Zinc(II)&#8208;Palladium(0) Catalytic System for the Asymmetric &#945;&#8208;Allylation of N&#8208;Unprotected Amino Esters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 45, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward and atom&#8208;economic catalytic method for asymmetric &#945;&#8208;allylation of N&#8208;unprotected amino esters was achieved to provide enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;quaternary &#945;&#8208;allyl amino esters with high yields and high enantioselectivities. To achieve this transformation, we utilized a ternary catalytic system consisting of a chiral phosphoramidite&#8208;palladium complex, an achiral picolinaldehyde, and the Lewis acid Zn(OTf)2.







Abstract
Reported in this work is a synergistic ternary achiral picolinaldehyde&#8208;Zn(II)&#8208;chiral palladium complex system for the highly enantioselective &#945;&#8208;allylation of N&#8208;unprotected amino esters. By utilizing a variety of allylic carbonates or vinyl benzoxazinanones as substrates, &#945;&#8208;allyl &#945;&#8208;amino esters were obtained in high yields (up to 96&#8201;%) with high enantioselectivities (up to 98&#8201;%&#8201;ee). Control experiments suggest that the coordination of Zn(II) with the Schiff base intermediate enhances the acidity of the &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds of amino esters, thereby favoring &#945;&#8208;allylation over intrinsic N&#8208;allylation. Furthermore, NMR studies reveal an interaction between the chiral palladium complex and the Zn(II)&#8208;Schiff base intermediate, leading to the formation of a picolinaldehyde&#8208;Zn(II)&#8208;Pd(0) catalytic system.

         <title>Deuteration Degree&#8208;Controllable Methylation via a Cascade Assembly Strategy using Methylamine&#8208;Water as Methyl Source</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 45, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylamine&#8208;water system was developed as a new methyl source for the methylation of &#946;&#8208;diketones under mild photocatalytic reaction conditions. Degree&#8208;controllable deuterated methylation could be easily achieved by using distinct combinations of d&#8208;methylamine&#8208;D2O system, allowing for the synthesis of deuterium&#8208;labelled bioactive molecules with a controllable number ranging from 0 to 3.







Abstract
We present a novel and effective photocatalytic method for the methylation of &#946;&#8208;diketones with controllable degrees of deuterium incorporation via development of new methyl sources. By utilizing a methylamine&#8208;water system as the methyl precursor and a cascade assembly strategy for deuteration degree control, we synthesized methylated compounds with varying degrees of deuterium incorporation, showcasing the versatility of this approach. We examined a range of &#946;&#8208;diketone substrates and synthesized key intermediates for drug and bioactive compounds with varying degrees of deuterium incorporation, ranging from 0 to 3. We also investigated and discussed the postulated reaction pathway. This work demonstrates the utility of readily available reagents, methylamines and water, as a new methyl source, and provides a simple and efficient strategy for the synthesis of degree&#8208;controllable deuterium&#8208;labelled compounds.

A Hamilton&#8208;type recognition motif is realized on the surface of 1T&#8208;MoS2 where host&#8208;guest interactions are taking place via hydrogen bonding for the electrochemical sensing of barbiturates.







Abstract
The covalent modification of the metallic phase of MoS2 with a Hamilton&#8208;type ligand is presented, transforming MoS2 to a recognition platform which is able to embrace barbiturate moieties via hydrogen bonding. The successful hydrogen bonding formation is easily monitored by simple electrochemical assessments, if a ferrocene&#8208;labeled barbiturate analogue is utilized as a proof of concept. Full spectroscopic, thermal, and electron microscopy imaging characterization is provided for the newly formed recognition system, along with valuable insights concerning the electrochemical sensing. The given methodology expands beyond the sensing applications, confidently entering the territory of supramolecular interactions on the surface of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides. The well&#8208;designed host&#8208;guest chemistry presented herein, constitutes a guide and an inspiration for hosting customized&#8208;structured functional building blocks on MoS2 and its relatives via hydrogen bonding, opening up new opportunities regarding potential applications.

         <title>Direct C7&#8208;H Arylation of Pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]azines with Aryl Chlorides</title>

         <dc:description>
A new protocol for the palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation of pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]azines, using low&#8208;cost and abundant (hetero)aryl chlorides as the coupling partners, and without any stoichiometric metal additives is reported. The structural motif of coupling products can be found in many drugs and organic materials.







Abstract
C7&#8208;Arylated pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]azines are important structural motifs with profound applications in drug and material research. Here, we report a general and straighforward synthesis of these bi(hetero)aryls via palladium&#8208;catalyzed direct C&#8722;H arylation, employing low&#8208;cost and abundant (hetero)aryl chlorides as the aryl source. The catalytic system is robust and covers a wide substrate scope regarding heteroarenes as well as (hetero)aryl chlorides, with possible extension to the C&#8722;H arylation of [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidines. This study also presents a rare example of using (hetero)aryl chlorides for the direct C&#8722;H arylation of six&#8208;membered heteroarenes.

         <title>Xanthene&#8208;Separated 24 &#960;&#8208;Electron Antiaromatic Rosarin Dimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 45, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A co&#8208;facially linked rosarin dimer containing two antiaromatic monomeric macrocyclic units. Low temperature spectroscopic measurements and quantum mechanical calculations provide support for the conclusion that relative to the monomeric constituents the degree of antiaromaticity is reduced in the dimer.







Abstract
Antiaromatic molecules have recently received attention because of their intrinsic properties, such as high reactivity and their narrow HOMO&#8211;LUMO gaps. Stacking of antiaromatic molecules has been predicted to induce three&#8208;dimensional aromaticity via frontier orbital interactions. Here, we report a covalently linked &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacked rosarin dimer that has been examined experimentally by steady&#8208;state absorption and transient absorption measurements and theoretically by quantum chemical calculations, including time&#8208;dependent density functional theory, anisotropy of induced current density, and nucleus&#8208;independent chemical shift calculations. Relative to the corresponding monomer, the dimer exhibits diminished antiaromaticity upon lowering the temperature to 77&#8197;K, a finding ascribed to intramolecular interactions between the macrocyclic rosarin subunits.

Here, we report a covalently linked &#960;-&#960; stacked rosarin dimer that has been examined experimentally by steady-state absorption and transient absorption measurements and theoretically by quantum chemical calculations, including time-dependent density functional theory, anisotropy of induced current density, and nucleus-independent chemical shift calculations. Relative to the corresponding monomer, the dimer exhibits diminished antiaromaticity upon lowering the temperature to 77&#8197;K, a finding ascribed to intramolecular interactions between the macrocyclic rosarin subunits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A diastereomeric mixture of antlers (compounds (SP)&#8208;9 and (RP)&#8208;9) cannot be separated while attached to the deer. In winter, however, the deer will lose the single antler&#8208;diastereomers, and they can be resolved and collected to provide a robust starting material for (chiral) tools, like spears, axes or homogeneous catalysts. Note the useful enantiomerically pure (&#8722;)&#8208;menthol&#8208;containing food (Mentha arvensis) available for the deer. More information can be found in the Research Article by E. Hey&#8208;Hawkins and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300790). Cover designed by Dr. Christoph Selg.

         <dc:description>
Cyanine&#8211;aryl acetylene conjugates (pink) accumulate in the mitochondria of cancer cells, where the elevated pH and reactive oxygen species (white) levels allow the formation of thiyl radicals (yellow glowing pin and first arrow) from thiols (dark yellow pin). The activation enables radical thiol&#8208;yne coupling of biomolecules to the dye&#8211;alkyne conjugate (second arrow). This represents a powerful tool for the selective targeting of cancerous mitochondria through physicochemical accumulation and stimuli&#8208;responsive reactivity. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Mokhir, M.&#8197;R. Heinrich and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301340).

Chiral macrocycles composed of dimethyl 2,5&#8208;diaminoterephthalate units (n = 2&#8211;4) can be synthesised in a simple one&#8208;pot reaction. All products exhibit fluorescence in solution and in the solid state that is dependent on the size of the macrocyclic ring&#8212;the smaller the macrocycle, the longer the emission wavelength. The macrocycles show strong chiroptical activity, with the trimer showing particularly high dissymmetry factors in ECD and CPL spectra. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. G&#243;recki, M. Grzybowski and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300932).

         <title>Lanthanide Functionalized Covalent Organic Frameworks Hybrid Materials for Luminescence Responsive Chemical Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 45, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lanthanide functionalized covalent organic frameworks (COFs) hybrid materials embody the abundant multiple luminescence response with cooperative emission with energy transfer and discrete one without energy transfer. The summary is focused on the lanthanide functionalized COFs hybrid materials and the relevant systems for luminescence responsive chemical sensing.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) possess several unique features of structural and functional chemistry, together with other modular photophysical performance, which make them candidates for luminescence responsive chemical sensing. Lanthanide (Ln3+) functionalized COFs hybrid materials still keep the parent COFs&#8217; virtues and also embody the abundant multiple luminescence response with both COFs and Ln3+ ions or other guest species. In this review, the summary is highlighted on the lanthanide functionalized COFs hybrid materials and their relevant systems for luminescence responsive chemical sensing. It is subdivided into five sections involving the three main topics. Firstly, the basic knowledges of COFs materials related to the luminescence responsive chemical sensing are introduced (including three sections), involving the chemistry, application and post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) of COFs, the luminescence and luminescence responsive chemical sensing, and the luminescence responsive chemical sensing of non&#8208;lanthanide functionalized COFs hybrids materials. Secondly, the systematic progresses are outlined on the lanthanide functionalized COFs hybrid materials in luminescence responsive chemical sensing, which is the emphasis for this review. Finally, the conclusion and prospect are given.

Finally, the conclusion and prospect are given.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exploring the potential of anthraquinone&#8208;based hybrids for&#160; identifying a novel generation of antagonists for the Smoothened receptor in HH&#8208;dependent tumour</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural products (NPs) are highly profitable pharmacological tools due to their chemical diversity and ability to modulate biological systems. Accessing new chemical entities while retaining the biological relevance of natural chemotypes is a fundamental goal in the design of novel bioactive compounds. Notably, NPs have played a crucial role in understanding Hedgehog (HH) signalling and its pharmacological modulation in anticancer therapy. However, HH antagonists developed so far have shown several limitations, thus growing the interest in the design of second&#8208;generation HH inhibitors. Through smart manipulation of the NPs core&#8208;scaffold, unprecedented and intriguing architectures have been achieved following different design strategies. Here, we report the rational design and synthesis of a first and second generation of anthraquinone&#8208;based hybrids by combining the rhein scaffold with variously substituted piperazine nuclei that are structurally similar to the active portion of known SMO antagonists, the main transducer of the HH pathway.&#160;A thorough functional and biological investigation identified RH2_2 and RH2_6 rhein&#8208;based hybrids as valuable candidates for HH inhibition through SMO antagonism, with the consequent suppression of HH&#8208;dependent tumour growth. Our findings also corroborated the successful application of the NPs&#8208;based hybrid design strategy in the development of novel NP&#8208;based SMO antagonists.</dc:description>

         <title>Cryogenic Ion Fluorescence Spectroscopy: FRET in Rhodamine Homodimers and Heterodimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The internal electronic communication between two or more light&#8208;absorbers is fundamental for energy&#8208;transport processes, a field of large current interest. Here we have studied the intrinsic photophysics of homo&#8208; and heterodimers of rhodamine cations where just two methylene units bridge the dyes. Gas&#8208;phase experiments were done on frozen molecular ions at cryogenic temperatures using the newly built LUNA2 mass spectroscopy setup in Aarhus. Both absorption (from fluorescence excitation) and dispersed&#8208;fluorescence spectra were measured. In the gas phase, there is no dielectric screening from solvent molecules, and the effect of charges on transition energies is maximum. Indeed, bands are redshifted compared to those of monomer dyes due to the electric field that each dye senses from the other in a dimer. Importantly, also, as two chemically identical dyes in a homodimer do not experience the same field along the long axis, each dye has separate absorption. At low temperatures, it is therefore possible to selectively excite one dye. We find that fluorescence is dominantly from the dye with the lowest transition energy no matter which dye is photoexcited. Hence our work unequivocally demonstrates F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer even in homodimers where one dye acts as donor and the other as acceptor.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Structure, and Redox and Optical Properties of 5,10,15,20&#8208;Tetraaryl&#8208;5&#8208;azaporphyrinium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fundamental properties of azaporphyrins can be modulated over a wide range by changing the number of meso&#8208;nitrogen atoms. We report herein the first examples of 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetraaryl&#8208;5&#8208;azaporphyrinium (MTAMAP) salts, which were prepared via metal&#8208;templated cyclization of the corresponding zinc(II) and copper(II) complexes of 10&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;chloro&#8208;19&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;5,15&#8208;dimesityl&#8208;10&#8208;azabiladiene&#8208;ac. The inclusion of one meso&#8208;nitrogen atom in the 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetraarylporphyrin skeleton considerably changes the redox and optical properties as well as the degree of aromaticity of the porphyrin ring. The present findings suggest that MTAMAP salts would be promising scaffolds for the development of new azaporphyrin&#8208;based ionic fluorophores and photosensitizers.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Carbon&#8208;Sulfur Bond Formation between Aryl Iodides and Aromatic Sulfur Surrogates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation of aromatic thioethers from C&#8208;S coupling is of great importance in synthetic chemistry. Traditional solution strategies through transition&#8208;metal catalysis generally require bulk solution, heat, and longer reaction time. Herein, a mechano&#8208;promoted sulfenylation of aryl iodides with nickel catalysis is described. The active aromatic sulfide agents are in&#8208;situ generated from aromatic thiol or disulfide and subsequently adapted in the nickel catalytic cycle, with a tolerance of broad substituted groups under optimized conditions. In addition to the gram&#8208;scale synthesis that reveals the application potential of the method, the radical trap&#8208;ping and competitive experiments are also conducted for the mechanistic study, thus proposing the plausible mechanism rationally. Furthermore, the proposed methodology is certificated as being versatile and following the green principles with ideal calculated values of green chemistry matrix and the comparison with other approaches for C&#8208;S bond formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Double&#8208;Walled Covalent Organic Frameworks with High Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Double&#8208;walled covalent organic frameworks, consisting of two same building blocks parallel to each other forming ladder&#8208;shape linkers, could enhance the stability of the frameworks and increase the density of functional sites, thus making them suitable for various applications. In this study, two double&#8208;walled covalent organic frameworks, namely DW&#8208;COF&#8208;1 and DW&#8208;COF&#8208;2, were successfully synthesized via imine condensation. The resulting DW&#8208;COFs exhibited a honeycomb topology, high crystallinity and stability. Particularly, DW&#8208;COF&#8208;2 showed excellent resistance toward boiling water, strong acid, and strong base, due to its double&#8208;wall structure, which limits the exposure of labile imine bonds to external chemical environments. The DW&#8208;COFs showed high porosity near 900 m2/g, making them suitable for gas storage/separation. The selective gas adsorption experiments showed that at 273 K and 1 atm pressure, DW&#8208;COF&#8208;1 and DW&#8208;COF&#8208;2 exhibited a good IAST selectivity towards CO2/N2 (15/85) adsorption, with selectivity values of 121.3 and 56.4 for CO2 over N2, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and VCD Spectroscopic Characterization of a Series of Azacryptands from a Chiral Valine&#8208;based Derivative of Tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)amine (TREN)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Utilizing experimental and computational vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectroscopy, we explored the conformational preferences of a series of chiral C3&#8208;symmetric octaazacryptands with tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)&#8208;amine head groups derived from valine. While the spectra of the smallest azacryptand with p&#8208;phenyl linkers and its elongated derivative with p&#8208;biphenyls linker were found to match well with the computed spectra, the computed conformational preferences of the m&#8208;biphenyl&#8208;based azacryptand did not seem to reflect the conformations dominating in chloroform solution. A detailed analysis revealed that structural changes resulting in a collapsed cage structure gave a notably better match with the experiment. It could subsequently be concluded from the VCD analysis, that the octaazacryptands prefer a collapsed structure, which is not predicted by density functional theory (DFT) calculations as the global minimum structures. These findings are expected to have consequences also for future studies on inclusion complexes of such azacryptands.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrosynthesis of metal&#8208;organic framework films with well&#8208;defined facets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The deposition of metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) films with defined exposed facets is important to enhance the performance of these films for e.g. catalysis or separations. In this work, MOF films with specific exposed facets are electrodeposited anodically on various substrates (e.g. on copper&#8208;sputtered Si wafers, copper meshes, copper foams, and polypropylene membranes). The influence of the deposition parameters, including the pH of the solution, current density, concentration of linker, and solvent, on the exposed facets of the deposited MOFs was investigated. The results suggest that precise control over the supersaturation during anodic deposition is a possible strategy for synthesizing MOF crystals with well&#8208;defined exposed facets. This approach provides a powerful toolbox for various applications requiring crystal facet control of MOF films.</dc:description>

         <title>Neutral and Cationic Molybdenum Imido Alkylidene Cyclic Alkyl Amino Carbene (CAAC) Complexes for Olefin Metathesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first neutral and cationic molybdenum imido alkylidene cyclic alkyl amino carbene (CAAC) complexes are reported. Different ligand combinations together with selected single crystal X&#8208;ray structures provide a comprehensive understanding of their structural peculiarities. The new complexes outperform their NHC counterparts in the olefin metathesis of hydrocarbon&#8208;based olefins.







Abstract
The first neutral and cationic Mo imido alkylidene cyclic alkyl amino carbene (CAAC) complexes of the general formulae [Mo(N&#8722;Ar)(CHCMe2Ph)(X)2(CAAC)] and [Mo(N&#8722;Ar)(CHCMe2Ph)(X)(CAAC)][B(ArF)4] (X=Br, Cl, OTf, OC6F5; CAAC=1&#8208;(2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3)&#8208;3,3,5,5&#8208;tetramethyltetrahydropyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) have been synthesized from molybdenum imido bishalide alkylidene DME precursors. Different combinations of the imido and &#8220;X&#8221; ligands have been employed to understand synthetic peculiarities. Selected complexes have been characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. Due to the pronounced &#963;&#8208;donor/&#960;&#8208;acceptor characteristics of CAACs, the corresponding neutral and cationic molybdenum imido alkylidene CAAC complexes do not require the presence of stabilizing donor ligands such as nitriles. Calculations on the PBE0&#8208;D3BJ/def2&#8208;TZVP level for PBE0&#8208;D3BJ/def2&#8208;SVP optimized geometries revealed partial charges at molybdenum similar to the corresponding molybdenum imido alkylidene N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes with a slightly higher polarization of the molybdenum alkylidene bond in the CAAC complexes. All cationic complexes have been tested in olefin metathesis reactions and showed improved activity compared to the analogous NHC complexes for hydrocarbon&#8208;based substrates, allowing for turnover numbers (TONs) up to 9500 even at room temperature. Some Mo imido alkylidene CAAC complexes are tolerant towards functional groups like thioethers and sulfonamides.

         <title>NAD(P)H:Quinone Acceptor Oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) Activatable Salicylamide H+/Cl&#8722; Transporters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we report two enzyme activatable ion transport systems that, on selective activation by NQO1&#8208; an enzyme abundant in cancer cells, are capable of transporting H+/Cl&#8722; across the lipid bilayer. This transport disrupts the ion homeostasis specifically in the cancer cells and triggers apoptosis via mitochondrial membrane depolarization, lysosomal deacidification, and oxidative stress induction.







Abstract
NAD(P)H:quinone acceptor oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), a detoxifying enzyme overexpressed in tumors, plays a key role in protecting cancer cells against oxidative stress and thus has been considered an attractive candidate for activating prodrug(s). Herein, we report the first use of NQO1 for the selective activation of &#8216;protransporter&#8217; systems in cancer cells leading to the induction of apoptosis. Salicylamides, easily synthesizable small molecules, have been effectively used for efficient H+/Cl&#8722; symport across lipid membranes. The ion transport activity of salicylamides was efficiently abated by caging the OH group with NQO1 activatable quinones via either ether or ester linkage. The release of active transporters, following the reduction of quinone caged &#8216;protransporters&#8217; by NQO1, was verified. Both the transporters and protransporters exhibited significant toxicity towards the MCF&#8208;7 breast cancer line, mediated via the induction of oxidative stress, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and lysosomal deacidification. Induction of cell death via intrinsic apoptotic pathway was verified by monitoring PARP1 cleavage.

         <title>Naphthalimide&#8208;Dyes Bearing Phosphine and Phosphorylamide Moieties: Synthesis and Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New 1,8&#8208;naphthalimides bearing phosphine and amine chelating moieties has been prepared and their optical properties both as single molecules and when complexed on Pd(II) ions have been investigated. The complexation with Pd(II) quenches the fluorescence emission of the dye but activates an unexpected reactivity leading to a novel strongly emissive 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide dye bearing a cyclic phosphorylamide moiety.







Abstract
1,8&#8208;Naphthalimides (NIs) represent a class of organic dyes with interesting optical properties that has been extensively explored in the last decades in lighting devices, chemosensors, optical probes or medicinal chemistry. However, despite their remarkable potential, reports on organometallic dyes bearing NIs are scarce and virtually inexistent regarding palladium(II) complexes. Herein, we report the synthesis of NIs bearing phosphine and amine chelating moieties and the characterization of their optical properties both as single molecules and when complexed on Pd(II) ions. It is shown that the introduction of phosphine moieties in the naphthalimide core results in a marked increase in non&#8208;radiative processes, leading to a significant reduction of the emission efficiency and lifetime of these dyes, compared to amine&#8208;bearing counterparts. The complexation to Pd(II) sequesters the electronic contribution of chelating moieties, with complexes assuming an optical behavior similar to that of unsubstituted 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide. The complexation significantly increases the acidity of chelating secondary amines, giving rise to an unexpected intramolecular reaction that results in the formation of a novel 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide dye bearing a cyclic phosphorylamide moiety. The new dye exhibits good emission quantum yield, long fluorescence lifetime and sensitivity to basic media, evidencing potential for application in optical imaging and sensing scenarios.

         <title>Caged Luciferase Inhibitor&#8208;Based Bioluminescence Switching Strategy Enables Efficient Detection of Serum APN Activity and the Identification of Its Roles in Metastasis of Non&#8208;Small Cell Lung Cancer
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A caged luciferase inhibitor&#8208;based bioluminescence&#8208;switching strategy (CLIBS) is developed and used to determine circulating Aminopeptidase N (APN) activity in the complicated bio&#8208;samples with robust efficacy. By applying the CLIBS to serum samples in non&#8211;small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, it is revealed that circulating APN activity serves as an independent factor for forecasting NSCLC patients&#8217; risk of metastasis.







Abstract
Bioluminogenic probes emerged as powerful tools for imaging and analysis of various bioanalyses, but traditional approaches would be limited to the low sensitivity during determine the low activity of protease in clinical specimens. Herein, we proposed a caged luciferase inhibitor&#8208;based bioluminescence&#8208;switching strategy (CLIBS) by using a cleavable luciferase inhibitor to modulate the activity of luciferase reporter to amplify the detective signals, which led to the enhancement of detection sensitivity, and enabled the determination of circulating Aminopeptidase N (APN) activity in thousands of times diluted serum. By applying the CLIBS to serum samples in non&#8211;small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients from two clinical cohorts, we revealed that, for the first time, higher circulating APN activities but not its concentration, were associated with more NSCLC metastasis or higher metastasis stages by subsequent clinical analysis, and can serve as an independent factor for forecasting NSCLC patients&#8217; risk of metastasis.

         <title>Photoinduced Ring&#8208;Opening and Phototoxicity of an Indolin&#8208;3&#8208;one Derivative</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The investigated indolin&#8208;3&#8208;one derivative exhibits fast photoisomerization in apolar solvents. In melanoma cells, the compound showed lipid droplet accumulation along with photoactivated toxicity.







Abstract
The study of a fluorescent indolin&#8208;3&#8208;one derivative is reported that, as opposed to its previously described congeners, selectively undergoes photoactivated ring&#8208;opening in apolar solvents. The excited state involved in this photoisomerization was partially deactivated by the formation of singlet oxygen. Cell studies revealed lipid droplet accumulation and efficient light&#8208;induced cytotoxicity.

2&#8208;(Pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)imidazo[1,5&#8208;b]pyridazine&#8208;7&#8208;ylidene was introduced as a dimetal&#8208;binding rigid scaffold. The scaffold was first converted into an Au,N,N&#8208;tridentate ligand through binding of Au(I)Cl at the carbene site. By using the Au,N,N&#8208;tridentate ligand, various trinuclear heterobimetallic complexes with intermetallic interactions were readily preparable with 3d&#8208;transition metals (CuI, CuII, NiII, and CoII). The structures of these complexes were unambiguously determined by SC&#8208;XRD analysis.







Abstract
As a dimetal&#8208;binding rigid scaffold, 2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)imidazo[1,5&#8208;b]pyridazine&#8208;7&#8208;ylidene was introduced. The scaffold was first converted into a meridional Au,N,N&#8208;tridentate ligand through binding of a Au(I)Cl moiety at the carbene center. The Au(I) center and the N,N&#8208;chelating moiety were expected to function as metallophilic and 4e&#8208;&#963;&#8208;donative interaction sites, respectively, in the binding of the second metal center. In this manner, various trinuclear heterobimetallic complexes were synthesized with different 3d&#8208;metal sources, such as cationic CuI, CuII, NiII, and CoII salts. SC&#8208;XRD analysis showed that the mono&#8208;3d&#8208;metal di&#8208;gold(I) trinuclear heterobimetallic complexes were constructed through gold(I)&#8208;metal interactions. Metallophilic interactions were also investigated by quantum chemical calculations including the AIM and IGMH methods.

         <title>Iso&#8208;Pentadienyl Carbonate as a Five Carbon Synthon in Manganese(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Linear 1,3&#8208;Dienylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A manganese(I)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H dienylation of arenes using iso&#8208;pentadienyl carbonate as five carbon synthons is reported. This is a highly unprecedented report for selective linear 1,3&#8208;dienylation by using C&#8722;H activation catalysis. Our method facilitates the synthesis of varieties of dienes, including those suitable for normal or inverse electron demand Diels&#8208;Alder reactions, dienyl glycoconjugates, and unnatural amino acids. Moreover, the synthetic applicability of this method eased to deliver a 6/6/5&#8208;fused tricyclic nagilactone scaffold.







Abstract
Selective linear 1,3&#8208;dienylations are essential transformations, and numerous synthetic efforts have been documented. However, a general method enabling access to electron&#8208;rich, &#8208;poor, and biologically relevant dienyl molecules is in high demand. Hence, we report a straightforward method of manganese(I)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H dienylation of arenes by using iso&#8208;pentadienyl carbonate as a five carbon synthon. This is a highly unprecedented report for selective linear 1,3&#8208;dienylation using manganese C&#8722;H activation catalysis. Our method facilitates the synthesis of varieties of dienes, including those suitable for normal or inverse electron demand Diels&#8208;Alder reactions, dienyl glycoconjugates, and unnatural amino acids. Extensive mechanistic studies, including isolation of C&#8722;H activated organo&#8208;manganese complex and isotopic analyses, have supported the proposed mechanism of this dienylation. The synthetic applicability of this method eased to deliver a 6/6/5&#8208;fused tricyclic nagilactone scaffold.

         <dc:description>The geometrical regioselective E &#8594; Z isomerization of a conjugated alkene under thermal activation poses a challenge due to microscopic reversibility. Herein we report that such reversibility issues can be circumvented by integrating E &#8594; Z isomerization with subsequent cyclization cascade.&#160;Thus, linearly conjugated dienals in a mixture of toluene&#8210;alcohol (2:1) solvents or only with alcohol at 60&#8208;70 &#176;C can be converted to &#947;&#8208;alkoxybutenolides in moderate to good yields. The intermediary 2Z,4E&#8210;isomer can be isolated, which includes the first example of isolating the regioselective isomerization product under thermal conditions.&#160; Density functional theory (DFT) studies have been employed to shed light on the feasibility of geometrical alkene isomerization and ensuing cascade sequences. It has been observed that the regioselective 2E,4E &#8594; 2Z,4E isomerization of dienal is a thermodynamically facile (&#916;G &lt; 0) process. The thermodynamic plausibility of the subsequent cascade reaction from the Z&#8208;isomer to the anticipated product in the presence of a polar protic solvent (here MeOH) is also explicated. Out of the two probable pathways, the "hemiacetal pathway" involving a relay proton transfer is kinetically more feasible due to the diminished activation barrier than the conjugate addition pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly enantioselective synthesis of pharmaceuticals at chiral&#8208;encoded metal surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enantioselective catalysis is of crucial importance in modern chemistry and pharmaceutical science. To obtain high purity chiral compounds, although various concepts have been used for the development of enantioselective catalysts, most of them are based on homogeneous catalytic systems. Recently, we have successfully developed nanostructured metal layers imprinted with chiral information, which have been applied as electrocatalysts for the enantioselective synthesis of chiral model compounds. However, so far such materials have not been employed as heterogeneous catalysts for the enantioselective synthesis of real pharmaceutical products. In this contribution, we report the asymmetric synthesis of chiral pharmaceuticals (CPs) with chiral imprinted Pt&#8208;Ir surfaces as a simple hydrogenation catalyst. By fine&#8208;tuning the experimental parameters, a very high enantioselectivity (up to 95% enantiomeric excess, ee) with good catalyst stability can be achieved. The designed materials have also been successfully used as catalytically active stationary phases for the continuous asymmetric flow synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds. This illustrates the possibility of producing for the first time real chiral pharmaceuticals at such nanostructured metal surfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Application of Machine Learning Algorithms to Metadynamics for the Elucidation of the Binding Modes and Free Energy Landscape of Drug/Target Interactions: a Case Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the context of drug discovery, computational methods were able to accelerate the challenging process of designing and optimizing a new drug candidate. Amongst the possible atomistic simulation approaches, metadynamics (metaD) has proven very powerful. However, the choice of collective variables (CVs) is not trivial for complex systems. To automate the process of CVs identification, we apply here two different machine learning (ML) algorithms, namely DeepLDA and Autoencoder, to the metaD simulation of a well&#8208;researched drug/target complex, constituted by a pharmacologically relevant non&#8208;canonical DNA secondary structure (G&#8208;quadruplex) and a metallodrug acting as its stabilizer, as well as solvent molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox Activity of IrIII Complexes with Multidentate Ligands Based on Dipyrido&#8208;annulated N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes: Access to High Valent and High Spin State with Carbon Donors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic strategies to access high&#8208;valent iridium complexes usually require&#160;use of &#960; donating ligands bearing electronegative atoms (e.g. amide or oxide) or &#963; donating electropositive atoms (e.g. boryl or hydride). Besides the &#951;5&#8208;(methyl)cyclopentadienyl derivatives, high&#8208;valent &#951;1 carbon&#8208;ligated iridium complexes are challenging to synthesize. To meet this challenge, this work reports the oxidation behavior of an all&#8208;carbon&#8208;ligated anionic bis(CCC&#8208;pincer) IrIII complex. Being both &#963; and &#960; donating, the diaryl dipyrido&#8208;annulated N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (dpa&#8208;NHC) IrIII complex allowed a stepwise 4e&#8211; oxidation sequence. The first 2e&#8211; oxidation led to an oxidative coupling of two adjacent aryl groups, resulting in formation of a cationic chiral IrIII complex bearing a CCCC&#8208;tetradentate ligand. A further 2e&#8211; oxidation allowed isolation of a high&#8208;valent tricationic complex with a triplet ground state. These results close a synthetic gap for carbon&#8208;ligated iridium complexes and demonstrate the electronic tuning potential&#160;of organic &#960; ligands for unusual electronic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Spin Orbit Charge Transfer Intersystem Crossing and Slow Intramolecular Triplet&#8208;Triplet Energy Transfer in Bodipy&#8208;Perylenebisimide Compact Dyads and Triads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We prepared Bodipy (BDP)&#8208;perylenebisimide (PBI) donor&#8208;acceptor dyads/triad to study the spin orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC). For BDP&#8208;PBI&#8208;3, in which BDP was attached at the imide position of PBI, higher singlet oxygen quantum yield (FD = 85%) was observed than the bay&#8208;substituted derivative BDP&#8208;PBI&#8208;1 (FD = 30%). Femtosecond transient absorption spectra indicate slow F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET; 40.4 ps) and charge separation (CS; 1.55 ns) in BDP&#8208;PBI&#8208;3, while for BDP&#8208;PBI&#8208;1, CS takes 2.8 ps. For triad BDP&#8208;PBI&#8208;2, ultrafast FRET (149 fs) and CS (4.7 ps) process were observed, the subsequent charge recombination (CR) takes 5.8 ns and long lived 3PBI* (179.8 &#181;s) state is populated. Nanosecond transient absorption spectra of BDP&#8208;PBI&#8208;3 show that the CR gives upper triplet excited state (3BDP*) and subsequently, via a slow intramolecular triplet energy transfer (14.5 &#181;s), the 3PBI* state is finally populated, indicating that upper triplet state is involved in SOCT&#8208;ISC. Time resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed that both radical pair ISC (RP ISC) and SOCT&#8208;ISC contribute to the ISC. A rare electron spin polarization of (e, e, e, e, e, e) was observed for the triplet state formed via the RP ISC mechanism, due to the S&#8208;T+1/T0 states mixing.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Since the discovery of urea inclusion compounds (UICs) in 1940, the handedness of this chiral helical system has not been established experimentally. By studying three UIC systems containing light&#8208;atoms only, the optical rotations were first measured, and the absolute structures of the enantiomorphic domains of three UICs were determined via single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD). The correlation between the optical rotation and the absolute configuration of the UICs was finally established, showcasing the power of absolute structure determination via SCXRD, which is essential in structural chemistry and pharmaceutical research.</dc:description>

         <title>Aminoacid&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of Hollow Hierarchical FER Zeolite with Improved Catalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hierarchical zeolites are highly&#8208;desired catalysts in the petrochemical industry due to their shorter diffusion length, faster diffusion rate, and better accessibility to active acid sites compared with conventional zeolites. Herein, we report a simple aminoacid&#8208;assisted method to synthesize urchin&#8208;like hollow hierarchical FER zeolite with abundant mesopores and macroporous inner cavities. An aminoacid (i.e. L&#8208;lysine) is used to facilitate the agglomeration of primary nanoparticles, and the agglomerates with staged crystallization in the internal and surface. The preferential nucleation and crystal growth at the external surfaces together with the lagged crystallization of the inner core of the agglomerates results in the formation of hollow inner cavities after the exhaustion of interior materials. Thanks to the unique hierarchical structure and more accessible acid sites, the hollow hierarchical FER zeolite exhibits improved catalytic performance over the conventional one in the skeletal isomerization of 1&#8208;butene to isobutene.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilizing Nitroxide Spin Labels for Structural and Conformational Studies of Biomolecules by Maleimide Treatment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stabilizing NO radical: The instability of NO radicals in cell lysates and cells limits its application in characterizing biomolecular activity by EPR. Maleimide is shown as an effective reagent of stabilizing the NO radicals in cell lysates by preserving the intracellular confinement, enables high fidelity of EPR measurement of NO spin labelled biomolecules in maleimide treated cell lysates.







Abstract
Nitroxide (NO) spin radicals are effective in characterizing structures, interactions and dynamics of biomolecules. The EPR applications in cell lysates or intracellular milieu require stable spin labels, but NO radicals are unstable in such conditions. We showed that the destabilization of NO radicals in cell lysates or even in cells is caused by NADPH/NADH related enzymes, but not by the commonly believed reducing reagents such as GSH. Maleimide stabilizes the NO radicals in the cell lysates by consumption of the NADPH/NADH that are essential for the enzymes involved in destabilizing NO radicals, instead of serving as the solo thiol scavenger. The maleimide treatment retains the crowding properties of the intracellular components and allows to perform long&#8208;time EPR measurements of NO labeled biomolecules close to the intracellular conditions. The strategy of maleimide treatment on cell lysates for the EPR applications has been demonstrated on double electron&#8208;electron resonance (DEER) measurements on a number of NO labeled protein samples. The method opens a broad application range for the NO labeled biomolecules by EPR in conditions that resemble the intracellular milieu.

         <title>Recent Advances in Aerobic Oxidative of C&#8722;H Bond by Molecular Oxygen Focus on Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise summary of recent advances on green oxidative coupling reactions of C&#8722;H bond focus on heterocyclic compounds for construction of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;X (X=N, O, S, or P) bonds using O2 as internal oxidant since 2010 was given. The transformations described here aim to provide a platform for expanding the scope and utility of O2 as green oxidation, together with a brief discussion on research into the mechanisms behind it, hoping to reveal some common reaction patterns and development trends, as well as potential applications and challenges in the near future.







Abstract
Aerobic oxidative cross&#8208;coupling represents one of the most straightforward and atom&#8208;economic methods for construction of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;X (X=N, O, S, or P) bonds using air as a sustainable external oxidant. The oxidative coupling of C&#8722;H bonds in heterocyclic compounds can effectively increase their molecular complexity by introducing new functional groups through C&#8722;H bond activation, or by formation of new heterocyclic structures through cascade construction of two or more sequential chemical bonds. This is very useful as it can increase the potential applications of these structures in natural products, pharmaceuticals, agricultural chemicals, and functional materials. This is a representative overview of recent progress since 2010 on green oxidative coupling reactions of C&#8722;H bond using O2 or air as internal oxidant focus on Heterocycles. It aims to provide a platform for expanding the scope and utility of air as green oxidant, together with a brief discussion on research into the mechanisms behind it.

         <title>Coordination Behavior of the Tellurium Incorporated Mercuraazametallamacrocycle and Investigation of d10&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;d10 Interactions between Closed Shell (Ag+ Hg2+) Metal Ions</title>

Six Metal Interactions: This is the first isolated tellurium and mercury containing metallaazamacrocycle which exhibits unsymmetrical figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight conformation. It hosts two silver ions in the skeleton and displays intramolecular Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag, Ag&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te, Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te as well as intermolecular Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Hg interactions. The intermolecular Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Hg mercurophilic interactions connect six atoms as Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te in non&#8208;linear fashion.







Abstract
Herein, a new tellurium and mercury containing mercuraazametallamacrocycle has been prepared via (2+2) condensation of bis(o&#8208;aminophenyl)telluride and bis(o&#8208;formylphenyl)mercury(II). The isolated bright yellow solid of mercuraazametallamacrocycle has adopted unsymmetrical figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight conformation in the crystal structure. To study the metallophilic interactions between closed shell metal ions, the macrocyclic ligand has been treated with two equiv. of AgOTf (OTf=trifluoromethansulfonate) and AgBF4, which afforded greenish&#8208;yellow bimetallic silver complexes. The isolated silver complexes displayed intramolecular Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag, Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag interactions as well as intermolecular Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Hg interactions and formed an extended 1D molecular chain by directing six atoms to interact as TeII&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;AgI&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;HgII&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;HgII&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;AgI&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;TeII in a non linear fashion. The Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag, Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag interactions have also been studied in solution by 199Hg, 125Te&#8197;NMR spectroscopy, absorption, and emission spectroscopy. In DFT calculations, the Atom in Molecule (AIM) analysis, non&#8208;covalent interactions (NCI), natural bonding orbital (NBO) analysis strongly supported for experimental evidences and revealed that the intermolecular Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Hg interaction is stronger than the intramolecular Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag interactions.

         <title>Borylated Subphthalocyanines: Versatile Precursors for the Preparation of Functional Bowl&#8208;Shaped Aromatics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis, electronic properties, and reactivity of borylated subphthalocyanines (SubPcs) are reported. These compounds display a great stability and serve as powerful starting materials for the post&#8208;functionalization of SubPcs via cross&#8208;coupling reactions.







Abstract
The peripheral borylation of porphyrinoids has become a key step to prepare advanced functional materials. This study reports the synthesis, electronic properties, and reactivity of borylated subphthalocyanines. These compounds, which are prepared by Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura borylation in excellent yields, are easily purified, display a great stability, and serve as powerful starting materials for the post&#8208;functionalization of SubPcs via cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Remarkably, this novel approach is more efficient than the methodologies already described and enables the preparation of exotic systems, such as SubPc dimeric species linked by C&#8722;C bonds, which are not accessible so far and present promising properties for optoelectronic devices.

Allyation: The selective C7&#8208;allylation of indolines with allyl bromide under ruthenium catalysis has been reported. Experimental and DFT study has been carried out to probe the mechanism of the reaction.







Abstract
The selective C7&#8208;allylation of indolines with allyl bromide under ruthenium catalysis has been revealed here. Under established reaction conditions, C7&#8208;allylation of various indolines, including drug compounds, was accomplished with good selectivity and yields. Based on combined experimental and density functional theory (DFT) studies, the olefin insertion route was energetically favorable among four possible pathways. Experimental and DFT studies further revealed that the C&#8722;H activation is a reversible rate&#8208;limiting step.

         <title>Unexcited Light Source Imaging for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unexcited light imaging has gained much attention in recent years because of its high sensitivity and high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. This article provides an overview of the application of chemiluminescence, bioluminescence and afterglow luminescence in biomedical imaging. The imaging mechanisms and luminescence enhancement strategies are also briefly described.







Abstract
Optical imaging has a wide range of applications in the biomedical field, allowing the visualization of physiological processes and helping in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Unexcited light source imaging technologies, such as chemiluminescence imaging, bioluminescence imaging and afterglow imaging have attracted great attention in recent years because of the absence of excitation light interference in their application and the advantages of high sensitivity and high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. In this review, the latest advances in unexcited light source imaging technology for biomedical applications are highlighted. The design strategies of unexcited light source luminescent probes in improving luminescence brightness, penetration depth, quantum yield and targeting, and their applications in inflammation imaging, tumor imaging, liver and kidney injury imaging and bacterial infection imaging are introduced in detail. The research progress and future prospects of unexcited light source imaging for medical applications are further discussed.

&#8220;The interplay between the exceptional &#960;&#8208;acceptor and &#963;&#8208;donor properties of the pyridyl&#8208;mesoionic carbene is fascinating for the design of new potential photo&#8208; and electrocatalysts.&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at 10.1002/chem.202301205).







Abstract
Invited for the cover of this issue are Biprajit Sarkar and co&#8208;workers at the University of Stuttgart and University of Freiburg. In the image, the solar flare represents the non&#8208;innocence (fluorine&#8208;specific interactions) of the counterion, and the black hole at the metal center illustrates the oxidation/electron deficiency of the Cr&#8208;center, while the electron &#8220;gets lost&#8221; in the space (oxidation agent).

         <title>Pd&#8208;catalyzed Tandem Pathway for Stereo&#8208;selective Synthesis of (E)&#8208;1,3&#8208;Enyne from &#946;&#8208;Nitroalkenes by using a Sacrificial Directing Group</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The involvement of nitroalkenes instead of minimal one alkyne motif for (E)&#8208;1,3&#8208;enynes synthesis through a palladium catalyzed stereo&#8208;selective bond forming pathway at room temperature is presented. Implication of nitro group as a sacrificial directing group, formation of magical alkyne on a newly developed Csp3&#8208;Csp3 bond with initial palladium&#8208;MBH adduct make this methodology distinctive. This protocol features an unprecedented sequential acetate addition, carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation, isomerization of double bond and nitromethane degradation in a tandem catalytic walk via dancing hybridization. Mechanistic understanding through identification of intermediates and computational calculations furnishes complete insight into the tandem catalytic pathway. Broad substrates scope and functional groups tolerance make this synthetic methodology magnificent and dynamic. This represents the first example of stereo&#8208;selective 1,3&#8208;enyne synthesis exclusively from alkene substrates by introducing the concept of sacrificial directing group.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Reactivity of a NHC Nickel Bis&#8208;Boryl Complex: Reductive Elimination and Formation of Mono&#8208;Boryl Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of the first terminal mono&#8208;boryl complexes of nickel, which are not stabilized by a pincer ligand, is reported. The reaction of the nickel bis&#8208;boryl complex cis&#8208;[Ni(iPr2ImMe)2(Bcat)2] 1 (cat = 1,2&#8208;O2C6H4) with the small donor ligand PMe3 led to a complete ligand exchange at nickel with reductive elimination of B2cat2, formation of the bisNHC adduct [B2cat2 &#183; (iPr2ImMe)2] 3 and formation of [Ni(PMe3)4] 2 as the metal&#8208;containing species. Electrophilic attack of MeI on complex 1 or ligand dismutation of 1 with trans[Ni(iPr2ImMe)2Br2] led to loss of only one boryl ligand of 1 and afforded the nickel mono&#8208;boryl complexes trans&#8208;[Ni(iPr2ImMe)2(Bcat)Br] 4a and trans&#8208;[Ni(iPr2ImMe)2(Bcat)I] 4b.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of 4&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;4&#8208;fluoro&#8208;D&#8208;sedoheptulose: A Promising New Sugar to Apply the Principle of Metabolic Trapping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorinated carbohydrates are important tools for understanding the deregulation of metabolic fluxes and pathways. Fluorinating specific positions within the sugar scaffold can lead to enhanced metabolic stability and subsequent metabolic trapping in cells. This principle has, however, never been applied to study the metabolism of the rare sugars of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Thus, we designed and synthesized two fluorinated derivatives of D&#8208;sedoheptulose: 4&#8208;deoxy&#8208;4&#8208;fluoro&#8208;D&#8208;sedoheptulose (4DFS) and 3deoxy&#8208;3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;D&#8208;sedoheptulose (3DFS). We show that both sugars are taken up by human fibroblasts but that only 4DFS is phosphorylated. We could further show that fluorination of Dsedoheptulose at C&#8208;4 effectively halts the enzymatic degradation by transaldolase and transketolase. 4DFS thus has a high potential as a new PPP imaging probe based on the principle of metabolic trapping. Therefore, we further present the synthesis of potential radiolabeling precursors for 4DFS for future radiofluorinations with fluorine&#8208;18.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Dual Core Chromophores Based on Binaphthyl Acrylonitrile Motif with Tunable Dual Emission Bands and Anti&#8208;counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small organic molecules which can emit fluorescence with tunable dual emission bands are significant for fundamental research and broad applications. In this work, two binaphthyl based arylacrylonitrile derivatives with pyrene and triphenylamine unit (BiNp&#8208;Py and BiNp&#8208;TPA) were designed and synthesized, respectively, featuring chiral backbone and dual AIE&#8208;active cyanostyrene&#8208;linked chromophores. Excellent fluorescence emissions in a range of solution and solid states were observed with high quantum yields, indicative of the solvatochromism and mechanochromism. More interestingly, dual emission bands were found and tunable by the water fraction in THF, and speculatively attributed to the balancing of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and locally excited (LE) emission in solution and aggregate states. Furthermore, the potential application in anti&#8208;counterfeiting ink was also explored, indicating the very low concentration (5 ppm) for sufficient distinguishable vision and small colour migration (28 nm) for printing on the filter. The present work provides a new strategy to design organic luminescent structure having widely fluorescent emissions in dual states and a valuable reference for the study of chiral optical materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Protein Sequencing with Artificial Intelligence: Machine Learning Integrated Phosphorene Nanoslit</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving high throughput protein sequencing at single molecule resolution remains a daunting challenge. Herein, relying on a solid&#8208;state 2D phosphorene nanoslit device, we report an extraordinary biosensor to rapidly identify the key signatures of all twenty amino acids using interpretable machine learning (ML) model. The XGBoost regression algorithm allows the determination of transmission function of all twenty amino acids with high accuracy. The resultant ML and DFT studies reveal that it is possible to identify individual amino acids through transmission and current signals readouts with high sensitivity and selectivity. Moreover, we thoroughly compared our results to those from graphene nanoslit and found that the phosphorene nanoslit device can be an ideal candidate for protein sequencing up to a 13&#8208;fold increase in transmission sensitivity. The present study facilitates high throughput screening of all twenty amino acids and can be further extended to other biomolecules for disease diagnosis and therapeutic decision&#8208;making.</dc:description>

         <title>The Effect of Intramolecular Hydrogen Bonds on the Rotational Barriers of the Biaryl C&#8208;C Axis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Axially chiral compounds are attracting more and more attention recently. Although hydrogen bonds are reported as a vital weak force that influences the properties of compounds, the effect of intramolecular hydrogen bonds on the atropisomerization of the Caryl&#8208;Caryl single bonds has not yet been well quantitatively investigated. Here, a series of axially chiral biaryl compounds were synthesized to study the effect of hydrogen bonds on the rotational barriers of the biaryl C&#8208;C axis. Experimental studies demonstrated that the rotational barrier of hydrogen bonding biaryl 9 was significantly lower (46.7 kJ mol&#8208;1) than biaryl 10 without hydrogen bonds. Furthermore, theoretical studies revealed that the intramolecular hydrogen bond stabilized the transition state of tri&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted biaryl 9, relieving the steric repulsion in the TS. We believe that this study will provide chemists with a deeper understanding of the atropisomerization process of axially chiral biaryl compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Intramolecular [2+2] Trapping of 1,2&#8208;Cyclohexadienes: a Route to Rigid, Angularly Fused Tricyclic Scaffolds</title>

Is ring strain the new h&#957;? Tricyclic cis&#8208;fused alkylidene cyclobutanes are obtained cleanly from the intramolecular [2+2] trapping of 1,2&#8208;cyclohexadienes with styrenes and electron&#8208;deficient olefins.

This reaction &#8211; which occurs at ambient conditions &#8211; provides a mild alternative to classical [2+2] reactions which employ UV light activation or transition metal catalysis.







Abstract
1,2&#8208;Cyclohexadienes generated under mild fluoride&#8208;mediated desilylative conditions undergo efficient intramolecular [2+2] trapping, providing tricyclic alkylidene cyclobutanes with complete diastereoselectivity for the cis&#8208;fused products. Pendent styrenes or electron&#8208;deficient olefins can trap simple 1,2&#8208;cyclohexadienes or their oxygenated counterparts, with 14 substrates being disclosed. Reactions proceed at ambient temperature using just cesium fluoride in up to 91&#8201;% yield, and the necessary precursors are easily accessed from substituted 2&#8208;bromocyclohexenones. Multiple synthetic routes have been developed to install the appropriate functional groups required for [2+2] trapping.

A novel ZnII biological metal&#8211;organic framework mimics &#946;&#8208;lactamase enzymes. The crystal structure of a novel Zn&#8208;based biological MOF occupies the central position to reflect the crucial role that its porous functional channels play in the capture, immobilization and degradation of amoxicillin. The crystal structures of amoxicillin and the degraded derivative surround the MOF, indicating the differences in the antibiotic before and after entering the bioMOF.

         <title>SN2 versus E2 Competition of Cyclic Ethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our quantum chemical analyses reveal how the ring size of cyclic ethers has opposite effects on SN2 and E2 pathways and thus on the SN2/E2 competition. The preferred reaction pathway switches from E2, for large cyclic substrates, to SN2, for small cyclic substrates.







Abstract
We have quantum chemically studied the influence of ring strain on the competition between the two mechanistically different SN2 and E2 pathways using a series of archetypal ethers as substrate in combination with a diverse set of Lewis bases (F&#8722;, Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, HO&#8722;, H3CO&#8722;, HS&#8722;, H3CS&#8722;), using relativistic density functional theory at ZORA&#8208;OLYP/QZ4P. The ring strain in the substrate is systematically increased on going from a model acyclic ether to a 6&#8208; to 5&#8208; to 4&#8208; to 3&#8208;membered ether ring. We have found that the activation energy of the SN2 pathway sharply decreases when the ring strain of the system is increased, thus on going from large to small cyclic ethers, the SN2 reactivity increases. In contrast, the activation energy of the E2 pathway generally rises along this same series, that is, from large to small cyclic ethers. The opposing reactivity trends induce a mechanistic switch in the preferred reaction pathway for strong Lewis bases from E2, for large cyclic substrates, to SN2, for small cyclic substrates. Weak Lewis bases are unable to overcome the higher intrinsic distortivity of the E2 pathway and, therefore, always favor the less distortive SN2 reaction.

         <title>N&#8208;Oxides as Control Element for the Direction of a Sigmatropic Rearrangement: Application as a Switch for Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple change of solvent swaps the predominance of each of these two isomers: The high affinity of the N&#8208;oxide moiety for water and other hydroxylated solvents is responsible for this unprecedented &#8216;Reverse Meisenheimer Rearrangement&#8217;. The N&#8208;oxide fragment thus serves as an &#8216;on/off&#8217; switch for fluorescence and possibly several other applications.







Abstract
An exceptional level of control over the direction of the (2,3)&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement between N&#8208;oxides and alkoxylamine is achieved by simply changing the solvent in which they are dissolved. Protic solvents like water, methanol and hexafluoroisopropanol favour the N&#8208;oxide form, while other solvents like acetone, acetonitrile and benzene favour the alkoxylamine. The reaction temperature and nature of the substituents on the alkene affect the rate of rearrangement. A N&#8208;oxide fragment was attached to two fluorescent molecules and acted as an on/off switch for their fluorescence. The conversion of alkoxylamines into the corresponding N&#8208;oxides has not previously been described and is here termed the &#8216;Reverse Meisenheimer Rearrangement&#8217;.

The &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-oxide fragment thus serves as an &#8216;on/off&#8217; switch for fluorescence and possibly several other applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An exceptional level of control over the direction of the (2,3)-sigmatropic rearrangement between &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-oxides and alkoxylamine is achieved by simply changing the solvent in which they are dissolved. Protic solvents like water, methanol and hexafluoroisopropanol favour the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-oxide form, while other solvents like acetone, acetonitrile and benzene favour the alkoxylamine. The reaction temperature and nature of the substituents on the alkene affect the rate of rearrangement. A &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-oxide fragment was attached to two fluorescent molecules and acted as an on/off switch for their fluorescence. The conversion of alkoxylamines into the corresponding &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-oxides has not previously been described and is here termed the &#8216;Reverse Meisenheimer Rearrangement&#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fibrils Emerging from Droplets: Molecular Guiding Principles behind Phase Transitions of a Short Peptide&#8208;Based Condensate Studied by Solid&#8208;State NMR
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phase transitions of short peptide&#8208;based condensates are studied by TEM and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. Structural modelling based on NMR distance restraints suggests that matured droplets are stabilized by hydrogen bonds along the fibril axis and side&#8208;chain &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, pointing to the possible role of such noncovalent interactions in liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transitions.







Abstract
Biochemical reactions occurring in highly crowded cellular environments require different means of control to ensure productivity and specificity. Compartmentalization of reagents by liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation is one of these means. However, extremely high local protein concentrations of up to 400&#8197;mg/ml can result in pathological aggregation into fibrillar amyloid structures, a phenomenon that has been linked to various neurodegenerative diseases. Despite its relevance, the process of liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition inside condensates is still not well understood at the molecular level. We thus herein use small peptide derivatives that can undergo both liquid&#8208;liquid and subsequent liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid phase transition as model systems to study both processes. Using solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we compare the structure of condensed states of leucine, tryptophan and phenylalanine containing derivatives, distinguishing between liquid&#8208;like condensates, amorphous aggregates and fibrils, respectively. A structural model for the fibrils formed by the phenylalanine derivative was obtained by an NMR&#8208;based structure calculation. The fibrils are stabilised by hydrogen bonds and side&#8208;chain &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, which are likely much less pronounced or absent in the liquid and amorphous state. Such noncovalent interactions are equally important for the liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition of proteins, particularly those related to neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>Reactions of Tetra(o&#8208;tolyl)diborane(4) with Organic Azides: Formation of Fluorescent Boron&#8208;Fused Hexazenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel B2N6 heterocycle could be obtained by the reaction of tetra(o&#8208;tolyl)diborane(4) with primary alkyl azides. Experimental and theoretical studies revealed the stepwise mechanism, in which two azide molecules sequentially reacted. This B2N6 heterocycle exhibited a strong fluorescence with a high fluorescent quantum yield. In the case of using aryl, 3&#176;&#8208;alkyl, and 2&#176;&#8208;alkyl azides, different products were obtained depending on the substituents.







Abstract
The reaction of tetra(o&#8208;tolyl)diborane(4) with organic azides afforded three different compounds, diborylamines, diboryltriazenes, and B2&#8208;hexazenes having a bicyclic B2N6 ring system. The reaction with aryl azides gave diborylamines, while the reaction with 1&#8197;equiv. of alkyl azides furnished diboryltriazenes. In the case of the reaction with an excess amount of primary alkyl azide, a new heterocyclic B2&#8208;hexazenes were obtained. The formation of the B2N6 structure could be explained by one general reaction mechanism via the diboryltriazene intermediate according to the control experiments and DFT calculations. The B2&#8208;hexazenes exhibited a strong fluorescence with a remarkably high fluorescent quantum yield of up to 96&#8201;%.

         <title>The Cyanido&#8208;Sulfate Anion [SO3CN]&#8722;</title>

         <dc:description>
The new cyanido&#8208;sulfate anion, [SO3CN]&#8722;, is a complex of the Lewis base CN&#8722; and the Lewis acid SO3. The ion the a pseudo&#8208;halide analogon of the well&#8208;known fluorido&#8208; and chlorido&#8208;sulfates. Its formation is astonishing because the oxidation of the cyanide ion by SO3 seems to be favorable. For the successful preparation it seems to be benefitial that the synthesis can be carried out at room temperature.







Abstract
The reaction of the pyridine adduct of SO3 and tetra&#8208;n&#8208;butyl&#8208;ammonium cyanide, [N(nBu)4][CN] at room temperature leads to the unprecedented cyanido&#8208;sulfate anion [SO3CN]&#8722; stabilized in the salt [N(nBu)4][SO3CN]. The anion is a pseudo&#8208;halogen congener of the well&#8208;known fluoro&#8208; and chloro&#8208;sulfates. The new anion has been studied by vibrational spectroscopy and theoretical calculations.

         <title>The &#8220;How&#8221; and &#8220;Where&#8221; Behind the Functionalization of Graphene Oxide by Thiol&#8208;ene &#8220;Click&#8221; Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controlled and orthogonal derivatization of the alkene groups of graphene oxide can be achieved by thiol&#8208;ene radical addition and thiol&#8208;ene Michael addition. The reaction is triggered by either the addition of radical initiators or base catalysts.







Abstract
Graphene oxide (GO) is a 2D nanomaterial with unique chemistry due to the combination of sp2 hybridization and oxygen functional groups (OFGs) even in single layer. OFGs play a fundamental role in the chemical functionalization of GO to produce GO&#8208;based materials for diverse applications. However, traditional strategies that employ epoxides, alcohols, and carboxylic acids suffer from low control and undesirable side reactions, including by&#8208;product formation and GO reduction. Thiol&#8208;ene &#8220;click&#8221; reaction offers a promising and versatile chemical approach for the alkene functionalization (&#8722;C=C&#8722;) of GO, providing orthogonality, stereoselectivity, regioselectivity, and high yields while reducing by&#8208;products. This review examines the chemical functionalization of GO via thiol&#8208;ene &#8220;click&#8221; reactions, providing insights into the underlying reaction mechanisms, including the role of radical or base catalysts in triggering the reaction. We discuss the &#8220;how&#8221; and &#8220;where&#8221; the reaction takes place on GO, the strategies to avoid unwanted side reactions, such as GO reduction and by&#8208;product formation. We anticipate that multi&#8208;functionalization of GO via the alkene groups will enhance GO physicochemical properties while preserving its intrinsic chemistry.

     alt="The &#8220;How&#8221; and &#8220;Where&#8221; Behind the Functionalization of Graphene Oxide by Thiol-ene &#8220;Click&#8221; Chemistry"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A controlled and orthogonal derivatization of the alkene groups of graphene oxide can be achieved by thiol-ene radical addition and thiol-ene Michael addition. The reaction is triggered by either the addition of radical initiators or base catalysts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graphene oxide (GO) is a 2D nanomaterial with unique chemistry due to the combination of sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; hybridization and oxygen functional groups (OFGs) even in single layer. OFGs play a fundamental role in the chemical functionalization of GO to produce GO-based materials for diverse applications. However, traditional strategies that employ epoxides, alcohols, and carboxylic acids suffer from low control and undesirable side reactions, including by-product formation and GO reduction. Thiol-ene &#8220;click&#8221; reaction offers a promising and versatile chemical approach for the alkene functionalization (&#8722;C=C&#8722;) of GO, providing orthogonality, stereoselectivity, regioselectivity, and high yields while reducing by-products. This review examines the chemical functionalization of GO via thiol-ene &#8220;click&#8221; reactions, providing insights into the underlying reaction mechanisms, including the role of radical or base catalysts in triggering the reaction. We discuss the &#8220;how&#8221; and &#8220;where&#8221; the reaction takes place on GO, the strategies to avoid unwanted side reactions, such as GO reduction and by-product formation. We anticipate that multi-functionalization of GO via the alkene groups will enhance GO physicochemical properties while preserving its intrinsic chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structural Expansion of Cyclohepta[def]fluorene towards Azulene&#8208;Embedded Non&#8208;Benzenoid Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of unprecedented non&#8208;benzenoid NGs containing cyclohepta[def]fluorine unit are obtained via on&#8208;surface synthesis on Au(111). Scanning tunneling microscopy and non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy evidence their structures and conformations. Moreover, the dynamics of the precursor and its reaction products on the surface are analyzed by DFT and MD simulations.







Abstract
Non&#8208;benzenoid non&#8208;alternant nanographenes (NGs) have attracted increasing attention on account of their distinct electronic and structural features in comparison to their isomeric benzenoid counterparts. In this work, we present a series of unprecedented azulene&#8208;embedded NGs on Au(111) during the attempted synthesis of cyclohepta[def]fluorene&#8208;based high&#8208;spin non&#8208;Kekul&#233; structure. Comprehensive scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy (nc&#8208;AFM) evidence the structures and conformations of these unexpected products. The dynamics of the precursor bearing 9&#8208;(2,6&#8208;dimethylphenyl)anthracene and dihydro&#8208;dibenzo&#8208;cyclohepta[def]fluorene units and its reaction products on the surface are analyzed by density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Our study sheds light on the fundamental understanding of precursor design for the fabrication of &#960;&#8208;extended non&#8208;benzenoid NGs on a metal surface.

         <title>Materials for Electrochemiluminescence: TADF, Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding, and Aggregation&#8208; and Crystallization&#8208;Induced Emission Luminophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent advances towards enhanced electrochemiluminescence (ECL) using novel design strategies such as thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) luminophores (both donor&#8208;acceptor and multiresonance), hydrogen&#8208;bonding complexes, and aggregation&#8208; and crystallization&#8208;induced emission strategies. In many scenarios, the ECL enhancement is shown to be significant, thus suggesting future applications for thin film optoelectronics and sensing. These new avenues of intelligent ECL luminophore designs are expected to be of great importance for ECL&#8208;related research.







Abstract
Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) is a rapidly growing discipline with many analytical applications from immunoassays to single&#8208;molecule detection. At the forefront of ECL research is materials chemistry, which looks at engineering new materials and compounds exhibiting enhanced ECL efficiencies compared to conventional fluorescent materials. In this review, we summarize recent molecular design strategies that lead to high efficiency ECL. In particular, we feature recent advances in the use of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters to produce enhanced electrochemiluminescence. We also document how hydrogen bonding, aggregation, and crystallization can each be recruited in the design of materials showing enhanced electrochemiluminescence.

         <title>The Best of Both Worlds: Combining the Power of MICs and WCAs To Generate Stable and Crystalline CrI&#8208;Tetracarbonyl Complexes with &#960;&#8208;Accepting Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reversible oxidation of chromium tetracarbonyl complexes with bidentate &#960;&#8208;accepting ligands is a rare phenomenon, as the resulting electron deficiency at the metal center is often accompanied by subsequent CO dissociation. The incorporation of highly &#963;&#8208;donating pyridyl&#8208;mesoionic carbenes (py&#8208;MIC) facilitates the stabilization of highly reactive 17 VE species, while retaining the &#960;&#8208;acceptor properties. In combination with weakly coordinating anions (WCA), it was possible to isolate for the first time stable and crystalline CrI tetracarbonyl complexes with &#960;&#8208;accepting ligands. More information can be found in the Research Article by B. Sarkar and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301205).

         <title>Dimension Tuning of All&#8208;inorganic Ag&#8208;based Metal Halides by Solvent Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dimension growth of metal halides is important for its properties and applications. However, such dimension control of the metal halides is rarely reported in the literature and the growth mechanism is not clear yet. A minute difference of solvent properties can tremendously alter the process of nucleation and growth of crystals. Herein, an intriguing phenomenon of dimension tuning for Ag&#8208;based metal halides is reported. The 1D Cs2AgCl3 crystals can be obtained in pure DMF while the 2D CsAgCl2 crystals are obtained in pure DMSO. Both exhibit bright yellow emission, which are derived from self&#8208;trapping excitons (STEs). The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of Cs2AgCl3 (1D) and CsAgCl2 (2D) are 28.46% and 20.61%, respectively. In order to understand the mechanism of the dimension change, additional solvents (DMAC, DMPU) are also selected to process the precursor for crystal growth. By comparing the functional group, dielectric constant, and donor number among the four solvents, we find the donor number plays the predominant role in nucleation process for Cs2AgCl3 and CsAgCl2. This research reveals the relationship between coordination ability of the solvent and the dimension of metal halides.</dc:description>

         <title>Electroactive Dyes Based on 1,8&#8208;Naphthalimide with Acetylene Linkers as Promising OLED Materials &#8211; the Relationship Between Structure and Photophysical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Four A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type small organic molecules with 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide motifs were successfully synthesised. The designed compounds are built of two 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide units linked via ethynyl &#960;&#8208;linkages with selected functionalised donor motifs i.e. 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bithiophene, fluorene, phenothiazine and carbazole derivative. The synthesis based on Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling allowed us to obtain the presented dyes with good yields. The resulting symmetrical small molecules&#8217; optical, electrochemical and thermal properties were thoroughly investigated, and their potential applicability for the OLED devices was demonstrated. In addition, the relationship between molecular structure and properties was considered by employing experimental and theoretical studies. As a result of using various donor groups, it was possible to achieve efficient electroluminescence in the range from green (DEV4) to orange&#8208;red light (DEV3) with a maximum luminance of 3 820 cd/m2 for DEV4. Upon the insertion of an acetylene linker to the designed molecules, the free rotation of D and A fragments, and hence the effective &#960;&#8208;electron communication within the entire molecule, is possible, which was confirmed by DFT studies. The obtained dyes are characterised by high thermal stability, reversible oxidation&#8208;reduction process, satisfactory optoelectronic properties and good solubility in organic solvents, which is advisable for the application in small molecular organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (SM&#8208;OLEDs) technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Intramolecular Michael Addition via In Situ Generated Aminoisobenzofulvenes: Construction of Spiro Quaternary Carbon Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An unprecedented enantioselective organocatalytic spirocyclization strategy is presented via in situ generation of aminoisobezofulvenes. The reaction sequence involves a reductive Michael/aldol&#8208;condensation/Michael addition cascade via iminium&#8208;enamine catalysis. The key success of this spirocyclization was the formation of intermediatory nucleophilic aminoisobenzofuvenes accountable for intramolecular Michael addition. Benzospirononanes featuring an all carbon qauternary spirocenter were obtained using proline&#8208;derived amino&#8208;organocatalyst in moderate to good yields and excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (up to &gt;20:1 dr, and 99% ee). Post&#8208;methodological manipulation of benzospirononanes was also demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Ru(II)&#8208;Cyanine Complexes as Promising Photodynamic Photosensitizers for the Treatment of Hypoxic Tumours with Highly Penetrating 770 nm Near&#8208;Infrared Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light&#8208;activated treatments, such as photodynamic therapy (PDT), provide temporal and spatial control over a specific cytotoxic response by exploiting toxicity differences between irradiated and dark conditions. In this work, a novel strategy for developing near infrared (NIR)&#8208;activatable Ru(II) polypyridyl&#8208;based photosensitizers (PSs) was successfully developed through the incorporation of symmetric heptamethine cyanine dyes in the metal complex via a phenanthrimidazole ligand. Owing to their strong absorption in the NIR region, the PSs could be efficiently photoactivated with highly penetrating NIR light (770 nm), leading to high photocytotoxicities towards several cancer cell lines under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Notably, our lead PS (Ru&#8208;Cyn&#8208;1), which accumulated in the mitochondria, exhibited a good photocytotoxic activity under challenging low&#8208;oxygen concentration (2% O2) upon NIR light irradiation conditions (770 nm), owing to a combination of types I and II PDT mechanism. The fact that the PS Protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), the metabolite of the clinically approved 5&#8208;ALA PS, was found inactive under the same challenging conditions positions Ru&#8208;Cyn&#8208;1 complex as a promising PDT agent for the treatment of deep&#8208;seated hypoxic tumours.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;pot Synthesis of Polycyclic 4,5&#8208;Dihydropyridazine&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones by Inverse Electron&#8208;Demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) from Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the classical Inverse Electron&#8208;Demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reactions between alkenes and tetrazines, 4,5&#8208;dihydropyridazines are formed. 4,5&#8208;Dihydropyridazines are rapidly converted to the more energetically stable 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridazines by 1,3&#8208;prototropic isomerization. In this study, instead of 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridazines, 4,5&#8208;dihydropyridazine&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones were obtained as a result of IEDDA reactions between tetrazines with leaving groups at the 3,6&#8208;positions, and norbornene and barrelene&#8208;derived polycyclic alkenes in the presence of moisture in air or solvent. To show that this new method works not only on strained polycyclic alkenes but also on monocyclic and linear alkenes, the corresponding 4,5&#8208;dihydropyridazine&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones were obtained in high yields from the reactions performed with styrene and cyclopentene as well. The chemical structures of the polycyclic 4,5&#8208;dihydropyridazine&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones were determined by NMR and HRMS analyses. In addition, the exact structures of the polycyclic 4,5&#8208;dihydropyridazine&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones were also experimentally proven by converting them to pyridazine&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones known in the literature.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light and Triselenium Dicyanide (TSD): New Horizons in the Synthesis of Organic Selenocyanates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we describe a new method for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl selenocyanates by reacting triselenium dicyanide (TSD) and styrenes under blue light irradiation and O2 atmosphere. The reactions are triggered by the formation of Se&#8208;centered radical species, followed by the addition/oxidation of the styrene &#960;&#8208;bond. &#945;&#8208;Carbonyl selenocyanates and &#945;&#8208;hydroxy selenocyanates were obtained in moderate to excellent yields from aryl&#8208; and alkyl&#8208;substituted alkenes, respectively. It was demonstrated that &#945;&#8208;carbonyl selenocyanates could be used as a synthetic platform in a multicomponent reaction strategy to prepare 2&#8208;phenylimidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine derivatives, which were evaluated for their photophysical properties. Overall, this new method provides a useful tool for synthesizing &#945;&#8208;carbonyl selenocyanates, demonstrating their potential for use in the synthesis of other compounds, and opening new synthetic opportunities to construct organic selenocyanate compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Insight on Supramolecular Polyion Salts: Inositol Hexaphosphate Enclosed in Cationic Macrocyclic Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular macrocyclic forces have been used to trap phytate, myo&#8208;inositol&#8208;1,2,3,4,5,6&#8208;hexakisphosphate, a key bioanion with multiple roles in metabolic processes. Due to the complex chemistry of six multivalent phosphates surrounding the small, cyclic inositol framework, crystallographic information of simple phytate salts has been elusive. This report represents a combined crystallographic, theoretical, and solution binding investigation of a supramolecular macrocyclic complex of phytate.&#160; Together the results provide significant insight to phytate&#8217;s intramolecular and intermolecular interactions at the microenvironment level. The macrocycle&#8208;phytate aggregates consist of phytate anionic pairs, each partly sandwiched by two 24&#8208;membered, amide/amine&#8208;based cationic macrocycles. &#160;The phytate ion pairs hold the tetramer macrocyclic array together by six strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Both phytates crystallize in 1a5e phosphate conformations (one axial (P2) and five equatorial phosphates). Solution NMR binding studies in 1:1 DMSO&#8208;d6:D2O indicate 2:1 macrocycle:phytate associations, suggesting that the sandwich&#8208;like nature of the complex holds together in solution. DFT studies indicate the likely occurrence of dynamic intramolecular interchange of phosphate protons, as well as important roles for the axial (P2) phosphate in both intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid Access to Encapsulated Molecular Rotors via Coordination&#8208;Driven Macrocycle Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We've got you surrounded! Conjugated units that are encapsulated within the cavities of macrocycles can have unique properties often including the ability to rotate or wobble within an otherwise stationary crystal lattice. We introduce a strategy for forming macrocycles of this type in only a few synthetic steps using pyridine coordination to transition metals as the final, ring&#8208;closing step. More information can be found in the Research Article by N.&#8197;P.&#8197;Bowling and co&#8208;workers. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301745).

         <title>Harnessing Pillar[5]arene Host&#8211;Guest Complexation To Improve pH Stability and Affect Enzymatic Degradation of the Anticancer Prodrug Capecitabine: A 19F&#160;NMR Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Improving the ADMET: The stability of capecitabine, a widely used oral chemotherapeutic prodrug sold under the brand name Xeloda, in an acidic environment can be improved significantly by complexation with water&#8208;soluble pillararene derivatives. These host systems also modulate the enzymatic degradation of this clinically used anticancer prodrug.







Abstract
Cancer is a global health problem, and supramolecular chemotherapy is emerging as a novel strategy to battle the disease. Here, we first evaluated the thermodynamic and kinetic stability of the complexes formed between several water&#8208;soluble per&#8208;substituted pillar[5]arene derivatives and capecitabine (1), a widely used oral chemotherapeutic prodrug. The exchange rate was studied, for the first time in pillararene chemistry, by the 19F guest exchange saturation transfer (GEST) NMR technique. Importantly, when we evaluated the effect of complexation on the characteristics of 1, we found that the complexation of 1 with such pillar[5]arene hosts increased capecitabine stability at acidic pH very significantly and slowed its enzymatic degradation by the carboxylesterase enzyme in a manner that depended on the host. These interesting findings could have implications on the clinical use of this heavily used prodrug and might affect the management of cancer patients.

         <title>Reactivity of [AuF3(SIMes)]: Pathway to Unprecedented Structural Motifs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Offering a hand in gold fluorine chemistry: The trans&#8208;F in [AuF3(SIMes)] can be substituted by several ligands with varying electronic properties, yielding complexes of the type trans&#8208;[AuF2X(SIMes)]. They are introduced either by using trimethylsilyl compounds or, by using electron&#8208;deficient carbonyl&#8208;bearing molecules, the latter route being new in gold chemistry.







Abstract
We report on a comprehensive reactivity study starting from [AuF3(SIMes)] to synthesize different motifs of monomeric gold(III) fluorides. A plethora of different ligands has been introduced in a mono&#8208;substitution yielding trans&#8208;[AuF2X(SIMes)] including alkynido, cyanido, azido, and a set of perfluoroalkoxido complexes. The latter were better accomplished via use of perfluorinated carbonyl&#8208;bearing molecules, which is unprecedented in gold chemistry. In case of the cyanide and azide, triple substitution gave rise to the corresponding [AuX3(SIMes)] complexes. Comparison of the chemical shift of the carbene carbon atom in the 13C{1H}&#8197;NMR spectrum, the calculated SIMes affinity and the Au&#8722;C bond length in the solid state with related literature&#8208;known complexes yields a classification of trans&#8208;influences for a variety of ligands attached to the gold center. Therein, the mixed fluorido perfluoroalkoxido complexes have a similar SIMes affinity to AuF3 with a very low Gibbs energy of formation when using the perfluoro carbonyl route.

         <title>Stepwise Functionalization of Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes with Subsequent Molecular Conversion to Control Photoluminescence Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stepwise approach combining the functionalization of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and subsequent reactions to introduce functional groups into the addenda on the SWCNTs achieved control over the photoluminescence properties and the addition of functionality in the addenda.







Abstract
Functionalization of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) has attracted interest because it alters the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photoluminescence (PL) wavelength and emission efficiency. These modifications depend on the binding configuration and degree of functionalization. Excessive functionalization reduces the emission efficiency as the integrity of the conjugated &#960; system decreases; thus, controlling the degree of functionalization is essential. Because the binding configurations and degree of functionalization are affected by the reagent structure, a stepwise approach combining SWCNTs functionalization and subsequent reactions to introduce functional groups into the addenda could effectively control their PL properties and functionalities. We studied this approach by implementing the reductive alkylation of SWCNTs by using bromoalkanes with t&#8208;butyl carbamate (Boc)&#8208;protected amino groups and subsequent deprotection and amidation reactions. The reaction products were analyzed based on absorption, PL, and Raman spectroscopy and the Kaiser test. Depending on the structure of the reagent, deprotection and amidation reactions competed with the elimination reaction of addenda, altering the PL properties of the SWCNTs. Furthermore, the elimination reaction was inhibited in the adducts functionalized using dibromoalkane with Boc&#8208;protected amino groups, demonstrating that the use of appropriate reagents enables the molecular conversion of the functional groups of SWCNT adducts without affecting their PL properties.

         <title>Vectorization via Siderophores Increases Antibacterial Activity of K(RW)3 Peptides against Pseudomonas aeruginosa</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of Trojan Horse antibiotics is introduced, consisting of a six amino acid long synthetic antimicrobial peptide (synAMPs) and a number of different siderophore&#8208;type vectors. Excellent activity and internalization by a (yet) unidentified receptor are key features of the new conjugates.







Abstract
A series of new conjugates comprised from a small synthetic antimicrobial peptide (AMP) and a siderophore&#8208;type vector component was designed and tested for activity on P. aeruginosa PAO1 and several genetically modified strains. As AMP, the well&#8208;established arginine&#8208;tryptophane combination K(RW)3 (P1) was chosen with an added lysine for siderophore attachment. This peptide is easy to prepare, modify, and possesses good anti&#8208;bacterial activity. On the vector part, we examined several moieties: (i) the natural siderophore deferoxamine (DFO); (ii) bidentate iron chelators based on the hydroxamate building block (4&#8201;a&#8211;c) ; (iii) the non&#8208;siderophore chelators deferasirox (DFX) and deferiprone&#8208;carboxylate (DFP&#8208;COOH). All conjugates were prepared by solid phase synthesis techniques and fully characterized by HPLC and mass spectrometry (including HR&#8208;MS). 55Fe uptake assays indicate a receptor&#8208;mediated uptake for 4&#8201;a&#8211;c, DFP&#8208;COOH and DFO, which is dependent on the outer membrane transporter FoxA in the case of DFO. All conjugates showed increased antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa compared to the parent peptide P1 alone when investigated in iron&#8208;depleted medium. MIC values were as low as 2&#8197;&#956;M (for P1&#8208;DFP) on wild type P. aeruginosa. The activity of P1&#8208;DFO and P1&#8208;DFP was even better on genetically mutated strains unable to produce siderophores (down to 0.5&#8197;&#956;M). Although the DFX vector on its own was not able to transport iron inside the bacterial cell as shown by 55Fe uptake studies, the P1&#8208;DFX conjugate had excellent antibacterial activity compared to P1 (2&#8197;&#956;M, and as low as 0.25&#8197;&#956;M on a receptor&#8208;deficient strain unable to produce siderophores), suggesting that the conjugates were indeed recognized and internalized by an (unknown) transporter. Control experiments with an equimolar mixture of P1 and DFX confirm that the observed activity is intrinsic to vectorization. This work thus demonstrates the power of linking small AMPs covalently to siderophores for a new class of Trojan Horse antibiotics, with P1&#8208;DFP and P1&#8208;DFX being the most potent conjugates.

All conjugates were prepared by solid phase synthesis techniques and fully characterized by HPLC and mass spectrometry (including HR-MS). &lt;sup&gt;55&lt;/sup&gt;Fe uptake assays indicate a receptor-mediated uptake for &lt;b&gt;4&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;c&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;DFP-COOH&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;DFO&lt;/b&gt;, which is dependent on the outer membrane transporter FoxA in the case of &lt;b&gt;DFO&lt;/b&gt;. All conjugates showed increased antibacterial activity against &lt;i&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; compared to the parent peptide &lt;b&gt;P1&lt;/b&gt; alone when investigated in iron-depleted medium. MIC values were as low as 2&#8197;&#956;M (for &lt;b&gt;P1-DFP&lt;/b&gt;) on wild type &lt;i&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt;. The activity of &lt;b&gt;P1-DFO&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;P1-DFP&lt;/b&gt; was even better on genetically mutated strains unable to produce siderophores (down to 0.5&#8197;&#956;M). Although the &lt;b&gt;DFX&lt;/b&gt; vector on its own was not able to transport iron inside the bacterial cell as shown by &lt;sup&gt;55&lt;/sup&gt;Fe uptake studies, the &lt;b&gt;P1-DFX&lt;/b&gt; conjugate had excellent antibacterial activity compared to &lt;b&gt;P1&lt;/b&gt; (2&#8197;&#956;M, and as low as 0.25&#8197;&#956;M on a receptor-deficient strain unable to produce siderophores), suggesting that the conjugates were indeed recognized and internalized by an (unknown) transporter. Control experiments with an equimolar mixture of &lt;b&gt;P1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;DFX&lt;/b&gt; confirm that the observed activity is intrinsic to vectorization. This work thus demonstrates the power of linking small AMPs covalently to siderophores for a new class of Trojan Horse antibiotics, with &lt;b&gt;P1-DFP&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;P1-DFX&lt;/b&gt; being the most potent conjugates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The cover picture illustrates a molecule as a racing car driving on a circuit. The frame of the racing car shows the central skeleton of the molecule of different shape, which can be converted as it passes through a gate (electrode), accompanied by a drastic change in color. This cover implies that the redox reaction occurs in a stepwise manner, and they show tricolor chromic response. Moreover, the circuit represents its high reversibility. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y.&#8197;Ishigaki and co&#8208;workers. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301476).

         <title>Five Novel Silver&#8208;Based Coordination Polymers as Photoluminescent Sensing Platforms for the Detection of Nitrobenzene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Luminescent silver cluster&#8208;based coordination polymers composed of Ag10 or Ag12 cluster cores and multidentate pyridine linkers were synthesized as well as luminescent polymorphic silver(I)&#8208;based coordination polymers. It was found that these coordination polymers exhibit highly sensitive luminescence quenching effect to nitrobenzene, attributed to the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions between the polymers and nitrobenzene as well as the electron&#8208;withdrawing character of nitrobenzene.

         <title>The Power of Automation in Polymer Chemistry: Precision Synthesis of Multiblock Copolymers with Block Sequence Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An open&#8208;to&#8208;air, room&#8208;temperature RAFT polymerization procedure is employed in an automated platform to produce unprecedented complex macromolecular structures unobtainable manually. The precise structures made using this machine pave the way for the next generation of material design, harnessing large databases accessible using such automated material manufacturing.







Abstract
Machines can revolutionize the field of chemistry and material science, driving the development of new chemistries, increasing productivity, and facilitating reaction scale up. The incorporation of automated systems in the field of polymer chemistry has however proven challenging owing to the demanding reaction conditions, rendering the automation setup complex and costly. There is an imminent need for an automation platform which uses fast and simple polymerization protocols, while providing a high level of control on the structure of macromolecules via precision synthesis. This work combines an oxygen tolerant, room temperature polymerization method with a simple liquid handling robot to automatically prepare precise and high order multiblock copolymers with unprecedented livingness even after many chain extensions. The highest number of blocks synthesized in such a system is reported, demonstrating the capabilities of this automated platform for the rapid synthesis and complex polymer structure formation.

         <title>Organotin(IV)&#8208;Decorated Graphene Quantum Dots as Dual Platform for Molecular Imaging and Treatment of Triple Negative Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pharmacological activity of organotin(IV) complexes in cancer therapy is well recognized but their large applicability is hampered by their poor water solubility. Hence, carbon dots, in particular nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene quantum dots (NGQDs), may be a promising alternative for the efficient delivery of organotin(IV) compounds as they have a substantial aqueous solubility, a good chemical stability, and non&#8208;toxicity as well as a bright photoluminescence that make them ideal for theranostic applications against cancer. Two different multifunctional nanosystems have been synthesized and fully characterized based on two fragments of organotin&#8208;based cytotoxic compounds and 4&#8208;formylbenzoic acid (FBA), covalently grafted onto the NGQDs surface. Subsequently, an in vitro determination of the therapeutic and theranostic potential of the achieved multifunctional systems was carried out. The results showed a high cytotoxic potential of the NGQDs&#8208;FBA&#8208;Sn materials against breast cancer cell line (MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231) and a lower effect on a non&#8208;cancer cell line (kidney cells, HEK293T). Besides, thanks to their optical properties, the dots enabled their fluorescence molecular imaging in the cytoplasmatic region of the cells pointing towards a successful cellular uptake and a release of the metallodrug inside cancer cells (NGQDs&#8208;FBA&#8208;Sn).</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A chloroplatinum complex was arylated to obtain stimuli&#8208;responsive molecular crystals. The resulting arylplatinum complex showed polymorph&#8208;dependent emission, mechano&#8208; and thermochromic luminescence as well as comproportionation and &#960;&#8208;bridged dimerization. Simple mixing of structurally similar arylplatinum complexes at room temperature resulted in transfer of their aryl groups (comproportionation), which allowed tuning their mechanochromic profiles. We also found that recrystallization of the complex afforded a dimerized product in which two platinum ions are bridged via aryl groups resulting in a very short Pt&#8211;Pt distance (3.0466(10) &#197;).</dc:description>

         <title>In silico&#160;investigation of the thermochemistry and photoactivity of pyruvic acid in an aqueous solution of NaCl</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photochemistry of oxo&#8208;carboxylic acids contributes significantly to the complex chemistry occurring in the atmosphere. In this regard, pyruvic acid undergoes photoreactions that lead to many diverse products. The presence of sodium cation near pyruvic acid in an aqueous solution, or its conjugate base in non&#8208;acidic conditions,&#160;influences the hydration equilibrium and the photosensitivity to UV&#8208;visible light of the oxocarboxylic acid. We performed an ab initio metadynamics simulation which serves two purposes: first, it unveils the mechanisms of the reversible hydration reaction between the keto and the diol forms, with a free&#8208;energy difference of only 2 kJ/mol at 300 K, which shows the influence of sodium on the keto/diol ratio; second, it provides solvent&#8208;shared ion pairing (SSIP) and contact ion pairing (CIP) structures, including Na+&#160;coordinated to carbonyl, for the calculations of the electronic transition energies to an antibonding &#960;* orbital, which sheds light on the photoactivity of these two forms in the actinic region.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Solution Phase Synthesis and Functionalization of 2D WSe2 for Ambient Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2H phase tungsten diselenide (WSe2) is a p&#8208;type 2D semiconductor from the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) family with unique opto&#8208;electrical properties. Solution phase production of atomically thin WSe2&#160;is challenging due to its instability under ambient conditions. We present a highly efficient and scalable solution method for simultaneously exfoliating and functionalizing&#160;WSe2&#160;by leveraging the noncovalent interaction between mercapto&#8208;group and bulk WSe2.&#160;Single and few&#8208;layer 2H phase pure WSe2&#160;sheets of lateral size up to 5&#160;&#181;m with minimal basal plane defects, as revealed by XPS, Raman and FTIR spectroscopy, are produced in water&#8208;ethanol mixture. Remarkably, WSe2&#160;dispersion remains stable even at high concentrations (10 mg/ml) and exhibited high colloidal stability with shelf&#8208;life exceeding a year. The findings from our study suggest that through precise manipulation of intercalation chemistry, mass production of solution processable phase&#8208;sensitive 2D materials such as WSe2&#160;can be achieved. This advancement holds great potential for facilitating their practical utilization in various real&#8208;world applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;Mediated Cyclizations of Triene&#8208;Yne Systems: An Easy Access to Cyclopenta&#8208;Fused Anthracenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel triene&#8208;yne systems with a benzofulvene moiety were prepared and applied in the field of gold catalysis. Cyclopenta&#8208;fused anthracenes were obtained under mild conditions and easy steps synthesis.







Abstract
The direct synthesis of cyclopenta&#8208;fused anthracenes (CP&#8208;anthracenes) through a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction of easily available triene&#8208;yne systems bearing a benzofulvene substructure, is reported. The targets are of great interest due to the potential use as organic materials and the preparation of these compounds is gaining huge importance. The applied starting materials are readily available through a three&#8208;step synthesis, which further contributes to the advantages of this route. In addition, UV&#8208;Vis and fluorescent spectra of the obtained CP&#8208;anthracenes were recorded.

         <title>Surface Chemistry and Specific Surface Area Rule the Efficiency of Gold Nanoparticle Sensitizers in Proton Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radiosensitizer efficiency of gold nanoparticles from laser synthesis in liquids for proton therapy was tuned and factors maximizing the production of reactive oxygen species were identified. Here, I) high particle surface areas, II) the absence of surface ligands (citrate), III) alteration of surface chemistry for example higher defect densities were identified as main contributing factors.







Abstract
Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are currently the most studied radiosensitizers in proton therapy (PT) applicable for the treatment of solid tumors, where they amplify production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, it is underexplored how this amplification is correlated with the AuNPs&#8217; surface chemistry. To clarify this issue, we fabricated ligand&#8208;free AuNPs of different mean diameters by laser ablation in liquids (LAL) and laser fragmentation in liquids (LFL) and irradiated them with clinically relevant proton fields by using water phantoms. ROS generation was monitored by the fluorescent dye 7&#8208;OH&#8208;coumarin. Our findings reveal an enhancement of ROS production driven by I) increased total particle surface area, II) utilization of ligand&#8208;free AuNPs avoiding sodium citrate as a radical quencher ligands, and III) a higher density of structural defects generated by LFL synthesis, indicated by surface charge density. Based on these findings it may be concluded that the surface chemistry is a major and underexplored contributor to ROS generation and sensitizing effects of AuNPs in PT. We further highlight the applicability of AuNPs in&#8197;vitro in human medulloblastoma cells.

         <title>Post&#8208;modification of Robust Covalent Organic Framework for Efficient Sequestration of 99TcO4&#8722;/ReO4&#8211;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nuclear industry spent fuel reprocessing and some radioactive contamination sites often involve high acidity and salinity environments. Currently developed and reported sorbents in 99TcO4&#8211; sequestration from the nuclear waste are unstable and show low adsorption efficiency in harsh conditions. To address this issue, we developed a post&#8208;synthetic modification strategy by grafting imidazole&#8208;based ionic liquids (ILs) onto the backbone of covalent organic framework (COF) via vinyl polymerization. The resultant COF&#8208;polyILs sorbent exhibits fast adsorption kinetics (&lt; 5 min) and good sorption capacity (388 mg g&#8211;1) for ReO4&#8722; (a nonradioactive surrogate of 99TcO4&#8722;). Outstandingly, COF&#8208;polyILs composite shows superior ReO4&#8722; removal even under highly acidic conditions and in the presence of excess competing ions of Hanford low&#8208;level radioactive waste stream, benefiting from the stable covalent bonds between the COF and polyILs, mass of imidazole rings, and hydrophobic pores in COF.</dc:description>

         <title>Dearomatization of C6 Aromatic Hydrocarbons by Main Group Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dearomatization reaction is a powerful method for transformation of simple aromatic compounds to unique chemical architectures rapidly in synthetic chemistry. Over the past decades, the chemistry in this field has evolved significantly and various important organic compounds such as crucial bioactive molecules have been synthesized through dearomatization. In general, photochemical conditions or assistance by transition metals are required for dearomatization of rigid arenes. Recently, main&#8208;group elements, especially naturally abundant elements in the Earth&#8217;s crust, have attracted attention as they have low toxicity and are cost&#8208;effective compared to the late transition metals. In recent decades, a variety of low&#8208;valent main&#8208;group molecules, which enable the activation of stable aromatic compounds under mild conditions, have been developed. This minireview highlights the developments in the chemistry of dearomatization of C6 aromatic hydrocarbons by main&#8208;group compounds leading to the formation of seven&#8208;membered EC6 (E = main&#8208;group elements) ring or cycloaddition products.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective and Stepwise Functionalization of the Pyridazine Scaffold by using Thio&#8208;substituted Pyridazine Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Boron Polycation Supported by Cyclic Bis(carbodiphosphorane)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel cyclic bis(carbodiphosphorane) ligand was prepared and investigated in coordination with group 13 elements, B, Al and Ga. Al and Ga afforded dinuclear adduct where two metal centers were bridged by the bis(carbodiphosphorane) ligand. In contrast, the reaction with boron trichloride afforded a monomeric dicationic three&#8208;coordinate boron species composed of one boron moieties and one ligand. The structures of these products were determined by X&#8208;ray crystallography. In the dicationic boron compound, the sterically constrained cyclic structure enforced the boron center to acquire strained trigonal geometry with wide C&#8208;B&#8208;C angle of 140&#176;.&#160; Furthermore, theoretical investigation with DFT and NBO suggested a significant contribution of tricationic two&#8208;coordinate boron resonance structure supported by two CDP ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Advances in RNA Labeling with Trifluoromethyl Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorine labeling of ribonucleic acids&#160;in conjunction with 19F&#8208;NMR spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful strategy for spectroscopic analysis of RNA structure and dynamics, and RNA&#8211; ligand interactions. Here, we present the first syntheses of 2'&#8208;OCF3 guanosine and uridine phosphoramidites, their incorporation into oligoribonucleotides by solid&#8208;phase synthesis and a comprehensive study of their properties. NMR spectroscopic analysis showed that the 2'&#8208;OCF3 modification is associated with preferential C2'&#8208;endo conformation of the U and G ribose in single&#8208;stranded RNA. When paired to the complementary strand, slight destabilization of the duplex caused by the modification was revealed by UV melting curve analysis. Moreover, we demonstrate the power of the 2'&#8208;OCF3 label for NMR spectroscopy by dissecting RNA pseudoknot folding and its binding to a small molecule.&#160;Furthermore, the 2'&#8208;OCF3 modification has potential for applications in therapeutic oligonucleotides. To this end, we tested 2'&#8208;OCF3 modified siRNAs in silencing of the BASP1 gene which indicated enhanced performance. Importantly, together with our earlier work, the present study completes the set of 2'&#8208;OCF3 nucleoside phosphoramidites to all four standard nucleobases and hence enables applications that utilize the favorable properties of the 2'&#8208;OCF3 group without any restrictions in placing the modification into the RNA target sequence.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The synthesis of [n]cycloparaphenylenes ([n]CPPs) and similar nanohoops is usually based on the combination of building blocks to a macrocyclic precursor, which is then aromatized in the final step. Access to those building blocks in large amounts will simplify the synthesis and studies of CPPs as novel functional materials in applications. Herein, we report a continuous flow synthesis of key CPP building blocks using versatile synthesis techniques such as electrochemical oxidation, lithiations and Suzuki cross couplings in self&#8208;built reactors on up&#8208;to kilogram scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Characterisation, and Functionalisation of Charged Two&#8208;Dimensional MoS2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The applications of exfoliated MoS2 are limited by its inert surface and poor interface. We have activated the surface of exfoliated 2H&#8208;MoS2 by reacting it with NaBH4, forming an n&#8208;doped material as demonstrated by a negative zeta&#8208;potential value &#950; = &#8208;25 mV and a 20 nm (0.05 eV) red&#8208;shift in its photoluminescence spectrum. The novel material&#8217;s spectral properties were consistent with pristine 2H&#8208;MoS2 (as determined by HR&#8208;TEM, XPS, pXRD, DRIFT, TGA, and Raman spectroscopy). Importantly, it was readily dispersed in H2O unlike 2H&#8208;MoS2. Its dispersibility properties were explored for a variety of solvents and could be directly correlated with the relative permittivity of the respective solvents. The charged 2H&#8208;MoS2 reacted readily with an organo&#8208;iodide to deliver functionalized 2H&#8208;MoS2. Our approach delivers aqueous dispersions of semiconducting 2H&#8208;MoS2, without additives or chemical functionalities, and allows for controlled and facile functionalization of 2H&#8208;MoS2 opening multiple new avenues of semi&#8208;conducting MoS2 application.</dc:description>

         <title>A Metallabicycle From Thiocarbonyl&#8208;Cyclopropenium Coupling</title>

A novel architecture with no organic isolobal analogue, the bicyclic 3&#8208;mercaptopyrylium rhodium complexes, [Rh(&#954;2&#8208;C,S&#8208;C5S2Ph3)X2(PPh3)2] (X=Cl, Br), arise from thiocarbonyl&#8208;cyclopropenium coupling.







Abstract
Addition of triphenylcyclopropenium bromide to the thiocarbonyl complex [RhCl(CS)(PPh3)2] affords novel bicyclic metalla&#8208;3&#8208;mercapto&#8208;thiapyrylliums [Rh(&#954;2&#8208;C,S&#8208;C5S2Ph3)(PPh3)2X2] (X=Cl, Br) &#8211; heterocycles with no metal&#8208;free isolobal precedent. Halide abstraction with silver triflate (AgOTf) in acetonitrile affords the salt [Rh(&#954;2&#8208;C,S&#8208;C5S2Ph3)(NCMe)2(PPh3)2{Ag(OH2)2}{Ag(OTf)3}]&#8208;OTf which in turn reacts with sodium chloride to return [Rh(&#954;2&#8208;C,S&#8208;C5S2Ph3)(PPh3)2Cl2].

         <title>The Oxidation of Oxygen and Sulfur&#8208;Containing Heterocycles by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiophene/Furan metabolization: A model cytochrome P450 enzyme was used to demonstrate that thiophene substrates were oxidized via sulfoxidation before activation towards Diels&#8211;Alder dimerization. Replacing the thiophene ring with a furan resulted in oxidative ring opening to a hydroxybutanoyl derivative, using a whole&#8208;cell system, and this reaction was demonstrated to proceed via a reactive &#947;&#8208;keto&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehyde species.







Abstract
The cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily of monooxygenase enzymes play important roles in the metabolism of molecules which contain heterocyclic, aromatic functional groups. Here we study how oxygen&#8208; and sulfur&#8208;containing heterocyclic groups interact with and are oxidized using the bacterial enzyme CYP199A4. This enzyme oxidized both 4&#8208;(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzoic acid and 4&#8208;(thiophen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)benzoic acid almost exclusively via sulfoxidation. The thiophene oxides produced were activated towards Diels&#8208;Alder dimerization after sulfoxidation, forming dimeric metabolites. Despite X&#8208;ray crystal structures demonstrating that the aromatic carbon atoms of the thiophene ring were located closer to the heme than the sulfur, sulfoxidation was still favoured with 4&#8208;(thiophen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)benzoic acid. These results highlight a preference of this cytochrome P450 enzyme for sulfoxidation over aromatic hydroxylation. Calculations predict a strong preference for homodimerization of the enantiomers of the thiophene oxides and the formation of a single major product, in broad agreement with the experimental data. 4&#8208;(Furan&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzoic acid was oxidized to 4&#8208;(4&#8242;&#8208;hydroxybutanoyl)benzoic acid using a whole&#8208;cell system. This reaction proceeded via a &#947;&#8208;keto&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehyde species which could be trapped in&#8197;vitro using semicarbazide to generate a pyridazine species. The combination of the enzyme structures, the biochemical data and theoretical calculations provides detailed insight into the formation of the metabolites formed from these heterocyclic compounds.

     alt="The Oxidation of Oxygen and Sulfur-Containing Heterocycles by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thiophene/Furan metabolization&lt;/b&gt;: A model cytochrome P450 enzyme was used to demonstrate that thiophene substrates were oxidized via sulfoxidation before activation towards Diels&#8211;Alder dimerization. Replacing the thiophene ring with a furan resulted in oxidative ring opening to a hydroxybutanoyl derivative, using a whole-cell system, and this reaction was demonstrated to proceed via a reactive &#947;-keto-&#945;,&#946;-unsaturated aldehyde species.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily of monooxygenase enzymes play important roles in the metabolism of molecules which contain heterocyclic, aromatic functional groups. Here we study how oxygen- and sulfur-containing heterocyclic groups interact with and are oxidized using the bacterial enzyme CYP199A4. This enzyme oxidized both 4-(thiophen-2-yl)benzoic acid and 4-(thiophen-3-yl)benzoic acid almost exclusively via sulfoxidation. The thiophene oxides produced were activated towards Diels-Alder dimerization after sulfoxidation, forming dimeric metabolites. Despite X-ray crystal structures demonstrating that the aromatic carbon atoms of the thiophene ring were located closer to the heme than the sulfur, sulfoxidation was still favoured with 4-(thiophen-3-yl)benzoic acid. These results highlight a preference of this cytochrome P450 enzyme for sulfoxidation over aromatic hydroxylation. Calculations predict a strong preference for homodimerization of the enantiomers of the thiophene oxides and the formation of a single major product, in broad agreement with the experimental data. 4-(Furan-2-yl)benzoic acid was oxidized to 4-(4&#8242;-hydroxybutanoyl)benzoic acid using a whole-cell system. This reaction proceeded via a &#947;-keto-&#945;,&#946;-unsaturated aldehyde species which could be trapped in&#8197;vitro using semicarbazide to generate a pyridazine species. The combination of the enzyme structures, the biochemical data and theoretical calculations provides detailed insight into the formation of the metabolites formed from these heterocyclic compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Situ Formation of CoP/Co3O4 Heterojunction for Efficient Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CoP/Co3O4@TM (TM=titanium mesh) heterojunction exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and overall water splitting. OER requires an overpotential of 257&#8197;mV to reach 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and can work stably for more than 40&#8197;h, HER requires an overpotential of 98&#8197;mV to reach 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and overall water splitting only needs 1.590&#8197;V to reach 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Electrochemical water splitting is an environmentally friendly and effective energy storage method. However, it is still a huge challenge to prepare non&#8208;noble metal based electrocatalysts that possess high activity and long&#8208;term durability to realize efficient water splitting. Here, we present a novel method of low&#8208;temperature phosphating for preparing CoP/Co3O4 heterojunction nanowires catalyst on titanium mesh (TM) substrate that can be used for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and overall water splitting. CoP/Co3O4@TM heterojunction showed an excellent catalytic performance and long&#8208;term durability in 1.0&#8197;M KOH electrolyte. The overpotential of CoP/Co3O4@TM heterojunction was only 257&#8197;mV at 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 during the OER process, and it could work stably more than 40&#8197;h at 1.52&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE). During the HER process, the overpotential of CoP/Co3O4@TM heterojunction was only 98&#8197;mV at &#8722;10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. More importantly, when used as anodic and cathodic electrocatalyst, they achieved 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.59&#8197;V. The Faradaic efficiencies of OER and HER were 98.4&#8201;% and 99.4&#8201;%, respectively, outperforming Ru/Ir&#8208;based noble metal electrocatalysts and other non&#8208;noble metal electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.

         <title>Shape Transformation via Etching and Regrowth: A Systematic Study of Pd Nanocrystals with Different Shapes and Twin Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic study was conducted to investigate the etching and regrowth behaviors of Pd nanocrystals, including single&#8208;crystal cubes bounded by {100} facets, single&#8208;crystal octahedra and tetrahedra enclosed by {111} facets; and multiple&#8208;twinned icosahedra covered by {111} facets and twin boundaries.







Abstract
This article describes a systematic study of the oxidative etching and regrowth behaviors of Pd nanocrystals, including single&#8208;crystal cubes bounded by {100} facets, single&#8208;crystal octahedra and tetrahedra enclosed by {111} facets; and multiple&#8208;twinned icosahedra covered by {111} facets and twin boundaries. During etching, Pd atoms are preferentially oxidized and removed from the corners regardless of the type of nanocrystal, and the resultant Pd2+ ions are then reduced back to elemental Pd. For cubes and icosahedra, the newly formed Pd atoms are deposited on the {100} facets and twin boundaries, respectively, due to their relatively higher energies. For octahedra and tetrahedra, the Pd atoms self&#8208;nucleate in the solution phase, followed by their growth into small particles. We can control the regrowth rate relative to etching rate by varying the concentration of HCl in the reaction solution. As the concentration of HCl is increased, 18&#8208;nm Pd cubes are transformed into octahedra of 23, 18, and 13&#8197;nm, respectively, in edge length. Due to the absence of regrowth, however, Pd octahedra are transformed into truncated octahedra, cuboctahedra, and spheres with decreasing sizes whereas Pd tetrahedra evolve into truncated tetrahedra and spheres. In contrast, Pd icosahedra with twin boundaries on the surface are converted to asymmetric icosahedra, flower&#8208;like icosahedra, and spheres. This work not only advances the understanding of etching and growth behaviors of metal nanocrystals with various shapes and twin structures but also offers an alternative method for controlling their shape and size.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Site Metal Catalysts for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic effect of bimetallic catalytic sites and recent developments of dual&#8208;site metal catalysts (DSMCs) in the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) are presented. This Review includes a description and generalization of the classification of DSMCs used for CO2RR according to the form of metal existence; a detailed analysis of the mechanisms and importance of synergy in enhancing electrocatalytic properties for CO2RR.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a promising and green approach for reducing atmospheric CO2 concentration and achieving high&#8208;valued conversion of CO2 under the carbon&#8208;neutral policy. In CO2RR, the dual&#8208;site metal catalysts (DSMCs) have received wide attention for their ingenious design strategies, abundant active sites, and excellent catalytic performance attributed to the synergistic effect between dual&#8208;site in terms of activity, selectivity and stability, which plays a key role in catalytic reactions. This review provides a systematic summary and detailed classification of DSMCs for CO2RR, describes the mechanism of synergistic effects in catalytic reactions, and also introduces in&#8197;situ characterization techniques commonly used in CO2RR. Finally, the main challenges and prospects of dual&#8208;site metal catalysts and even multi&#8208;site catalysts for CO2 recycling are analyzed. It is believed that based on the understanding of bimetallic site catalysts and synergistic effects in CO2RR, well&#8208;designed high&#8208;performance, low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts are promising for achieving CO2 conversion, electrochemical energy conversion and storage in the future.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Tropane Scaffolds by an Organocatalyzed 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition of 3&#8208;Oxidopyridinium Betaines and Dienamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organocatalyzed (5+2) cycloaddition of 3&#8208;oxidopyridinium betaines and dienamines is presented. The protocol allows for the enantioselective construction of functionalized tropane scaffolds in up to &gt;99&#8201;%&#8201;ee and up to quantitative yield. DFT calculations propose a stepwise mechanism in which multiple cycloaddition pathways are possible, but the reversibility of diverging routes renders the reaction fully periselective.







Abstract
Tropane alkaloids constitute a compound&#8208;class which is structurally defined by a central 8&#8208;azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane core. A diverse bioactivity profile combined with an unusual aza&#8208;bridged bicyclic framework has made tropanes molecules&#8208;of&#8208;interest within organic chemistry.

     alt="Enantioselective Synthesis of Tropane Scaffolds by an Organocatalyzed 1,3-Dipolar Cycloaddition of 3-Oxidopyridinium Betaines and Dienamines"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An organocatalyzed (5+2) cycloaddition&lt;/b&gt; of 3-oxidopyridinium betaines and dienamines is presented. The protocol allows for the enantioselective construction of functionalized tropane scaffolds in up to &amp;gt;99&#8201;%&#8201;&lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt; and up to quantitative yield. DFT calculations propose a stepwise mechanism in which multiple cycloaddition pathways are possible, but the reversibility of diverging routes renders the reaction fully periselective.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tropane alkaloids constitute a compound-class which is structurally defined by a central 8-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane core. A diverse bioactivity profile combined with an unusual aza-bridged bicyclic framework has made tropanes molecules-of-interest within organic chemistry. Enantioselective examples of (5+2) cycloadditions between 3-oxidopyridinium betaines and olefins remain unexplored, despite 3-oxidopyridinium betaines being useful reagents in organic synthesis. The first asymmetric (5+2) cycloaddition of 3-oxidopyridinium betaines is reported, affording tropane derivatives in up to quantitative yield and with excellent control of peri-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantioselectivity. The reactivity is enabled by dienamine-activation of &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-unsaturated aldehydes combined with in&#8197;situ formation of the pyridinium reaction-partner. A simple &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-deprotection protocol allows for liberation of the tropane alkaloid motif, and synthetic elaborations of the cycloadducts demonstrate their synthetic utility to achieve highly diastereoselective modification around the bicyclic framework. DFT computations suggest a stepwise mechanism where regio- and stereoselectivity are defined during the first bond-forming step in which the pyridinium dipole exerts critical conformational control over its dienamine partner. In the second bond-forming step, a kinetic preference toward an initial (5+4) cycloadduct was identified; however, a lack of catalyst turn-over, reversibility, and thermodynamic bias favoring a (5+2) cycloadduct rendered the reaction fully periselective.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Water&#8208;Dispersible Carbon Nano&#8208;Test Tubes as a Container for Concentrated DNA Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon nano&#8208;test tubes whose inner surfaces were selectively oxidized work well as a nano&#8208;container for concentrated DNA molecules. The Ca2+&#8208;mediated electrostatic interaction is exerted between DNA phosphate groups and the carboxylate anions formed on the inner carbon surface and the interaction attracts DNA molecules to the inner space so as to make the total net charge of DNA equal to the charge of the carboxylate anions.







Abstract
Water&#8208;dispersible carbon nano&#8208;test tubes (CNTTs) with an inner and outer diameter of about 25 and 35&#8197;nm, respectively, were prepared by the template technique and then their inner carbon surface was selectively oxidized to introduce carboxy groups. The adsorption behavior of DNA molecules on the oxidized CNTTs (Ox&#8208;CNTTs) was examined in the presence of Ca2+ cations. Many DNA molecules are attracted to the inner space of Ox&#8208;CNTTs based on the Ca2+&#8208;mediated electrostatic interaction between DNA phosphate groups and carboxylate anions on the inner carbon surface. Moreover, the total net charge of the DNA adsorbed was found to be equal to the total charge of the carboxylate anions. This selective adsorption into the interior of Ox&#8208;CNTTs can be explained from the fact that the electrostatic interaction onto the inner concave surface is much stronger than that on the outer convex surface. On the other hand, the desorption of DNA easily occurs whenever Ca2+ cations are removed by washing with deionized water. Thus, each of Ox&#8208;CNTTs works well as a nano&#8208;container for a large amount of DNA molecules, thereby resulting in the occurrence of DNA enrichment in the nanospace.

         <title>Photocaging of Carboxylic Function Bearing Biomolecules by New Thiazole Derived Fluorophore</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design and synthesis of a new fluorophore containing an arylidene thiazole scaffold resulted in a compound with good photophysical characteristics. Furthermore, the thiazole C5&#8208;methyl group was easily modified into specific functional groups (CH2Br and CH2OH) for the formation of a series of photocourier molecules containing model compounds (benzoic acids), as well as prodrugs, including salicylic acid, caffeic acid, and chlorambucil via a &#8220;benzyl&#8221; linker. Spectral characteristics (1&#1053;, 13&#1057; NMR, and high&#8208;resolution mass spectra) corresponded to the proposed structures. The photocourier molecules demonstrated absorption with high values of coefficient of molar extinction, exhibited contrasting green emission, and showed good dark stability. The mechanism of the photorelease was investigated through spectral analysis, HPLV&#8208;HRMS, and supported by TD&#8208;DFT calculations. The photoheterolysis and elimination of carboxylic acids were proved to occur in the excited state, yielding a carbocation as an intermediate moiety. The fluorophore structure provided stability to the carbocation through the delocalization of the positive charge via resonance structures. Viability assessment of Vero cells using the MTT&#8208;test confirmed the weak cytotoxicity of prodrugs without irradiation and it increase upon UV&#8208;light.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal&#8208;doped two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semiconductor nanoplatelets (NPLs) with atomically precise thickness have attracted much research interest due to their inherent photo&#8208;physical properties. In this work, we have synthesized 2D Cu&#8208;doped CdS NPLs, investigated the charge transfer dynamics using ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, and fabricated an efficient photodetector device. A large Stoke&#8217;s shifted emission at ~685 nm with an average lifetime of about ~1.45 &#181;s is observed in Cu&#8208;doped CdS NPLs.&#160; Slower bleach recovery kinetics leads to large charge carrier separation in Cu&#8208;doped NPLs which is beneficial for photodetector applications. Cu&#8208;doped NPLs&#8208;based photodetectors exhibit high photocurrent, fast response (~120 ms), ~600 times higher photoresponsivity, and ~300 times higher detectivity (~4.1&#215;1013 Jones) than undoped CdS NPLs. These excellent properties of Cu&#8208;doped CdS NPLs make this material an efficient alternative for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>An Iron Macrocyclic Complex Containing Four &#8220;Hybrid&#8221; Pyridinium Amidate/Amidate N&#8208;Donors as a Catalyst for Oxidations With Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The macrocyclic pro&#8208;ligand [H4L][OTf]2, which contains four carboxamide functions and two conjugated pyridinium groups, is easily deprotonated by the weak base sodium acetate to give the corresponding neutral pro&#8208;ligand [H2L]. Metalation of [H2L] with iron(II) chloride proceeds rapidly to form the macrocyclic complex, [FeIIICl(L)]. This is an effective catalyst for the oxidation of the organic dye orange II by hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solution and the kinetic parameters for this reaction have been determined. In striking contrast to an analogous iron&#8208;TAML complex that contains two phenyl groups in place of the two pyridinium groups, [FeIIICl(L)] is a very active oxidation catalyst at pH 7 and is also highly stable towards acid promoted demetallation at pH 5 or above. The results show that the two pyridinium groups bring greatly enhanced catalytic properties to [FeIIICl(L)].</dc:description>

         <title>Dehydropolymerization of Amine&#8208;Boranes using Bis(imino)pyridine Rhodium Pre&#8208;Catalysis: &#963;&#8208;Amine&#8208;Borane Complexes, Nanoparticles, and&#160;Low Residual&#8208;Metal BN&#8208;Polymers that can be Chemically Repurposed</title>

         <dc:description>The sigma amine&#8208;borane complexes [Rh(L1)(h2:h2H3B&#183;NRH2)][OTf] (L1 = 2,6&#8208;bis&#8208;[1&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenylimino)ethyl]pyridine, R = Me, Et, nPr) are described, alongside [Rh(L1)(NMeH2)][OTf]. Using R = Me as the pre&#8208;catalyst (1 mol%) the dehydropolymerization of H3B&#183;NMeH2 gives [H2BNMeH]n selectively. Added NMeH2, or the direct use of [Rh(L1)(NMeH2)][OTf], is required for initiation of catalysis, which is suggested to operate through formation of a neutral hydride complex, Rh(L1)H. The formation of small (1&#8208;5 nm) nanoparticles is observed during catalysis, but studies are ambiguous as to whether the catalysis is solely nanoparticle promoted or if there is a molecular homogeneous component. [Rh(L1)(NMeH2)][OTf] is shown to operate at 0.025 mol% loadings on a 2 g scale to give polyaminoborane [H2BNMeH]n [Mn = 30,900 g/mol, &#208; = 1.8] that can be purified to a low residual [Rh] (6 &#181;g/g). Addition of Na[N(SiMe3)2] to [H2BNMeH]n results in selective depolymerization to form the eee&#8208;isomer of N,N,N&#8208;trimethylborazane [H2BNMeH]3: the chemical repurposing of a main&#8208;group polymer.</dc:description>

         <title>2,4,5,7&#8208;Tetranitrofluorenone Oximate for the Naked&#8208;Eye Detection of H&#8208;Bond Donors and the Chiroptical Sensing of Enantiopure Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen bonding greatly influences rates and equilibrium positions of chemical reactions, conformations, and sometimes even stereochemistry. Herein, we report on tetranitrofluorenone oximate, a novel dye capable of naked&#8208;eye detection of hydrogen&#8208;bond donating species (HBDs) and of rapid determination of H&#8208;bond donation strength by hypsochromic shift monitoring. In addition, the molecule possesses atropisomeric conformations, of M and P configuration, as evidenced in solid and solution state studies by X&#8208;ray diffraction and electronic circular dichroism (ECD), respectively. In the latter case, enantiopure bis&#8208;thioureas were the most effective HBDs to promote a chiral induction (diastereoselective recognition, Pfeiffer effect); the ECD results being rationalized by time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations. Based on these experiments, bis&#8208;thioureas were used as chiral reagents in asymmetric 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions of structurally&#8208;related nitrones; the ECD sensing of the stereoinduction between bis&#8208;thioureas and the oximate serving as an indirect method of selection of the most effective HBD for asymmetric synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>2&#8208;Benzamide Tellurenyl Iodides: Synthesis and Their Catalytic Role in CO2 Mitigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insertion of tellurium into carbon&#8208;iodine bond has been achieved for the first time by a base&#8208;free copper&#8208;catalyzed method for the construction of aryl 2&#8208;benzamide tellurenyl iodides. Furthermore, synthesized tellurenyl iodides were explored for CO2 mitigation to synthesize cyclic carbonates and 1,3&#8208;diaryl ureas, using epoxides and anilines, respectively. In addition, for the first time, the ebtellur intermediate is isolated and characterized by SC&#8208;XRD.







Abstract
Benzamide&#8208;derived organochalcogens (chalcogen=S, Se, and Te) have shown promising interest in biological and synthetic chemistry. Ebselen molecule derived from benzamide moiety is the most studied organoselenium. However, its heavier congener organotellurium is under&#8208;explored. Here, an efficient copper&#8208;catalyzed atom economical synthetic method has been developed to synthesize 2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;benzamide tellurenyl iodides by inserting a tellurium atom into carbon&#8208;iodine bond of 2&#8208;iodobenzamides in one pot with 78&#8211;95&#8201;% yields. Further, the Lewis acidic nature of Te center and Lewis basic nature of nitrogen of the synthesized 2&#8208;Iodo&#8208;N&#8208;(quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)benzamide tellurenyl iodides enabled them as pre&#8208;catalyst for the activation of epoxide with CO2 at 1&#8197;atm for the preparation of cyclic carbonates with TOF and TON values of 1447&#8197;h&#8722;1 and 4343, respectively, under solvent&#8208;free conditions. In addition, 2&#8208;iodo&#8208;N&#8208;(quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)benzamide tellurenyl iodides have also been used as pre&#8208;catalyst for activating anilines and CO2 to form a variety of 1,3&#8208;diaryl ureas up to 95&#8201;% yield. The mechanistic investigation for CO2 mitigation is done by 125Te&#8197;NMR and HRMS studies. It seems that the reaction proceeds via formation of catalytically active Te&#8722;N heterocycle, an ebtellur intermediate which is isolated and structurally characterized.

         <title>Infrared Spectroscopic and Theoretical Investigations of Group 13 Oxyfluorides OMF2 and OMF (M=B, Al, Ga, In)</title>

         <dc:description>
Terminal oxygen radicals involving group 13&#8201;atoms: We investigate herein oxydifluoride OMF2 (M=B, Al, Ga and In) radicals by the reactions of laser&#8208;ablated group 13 atoms with OF2 under cryogenic conditions in solid noble gas matrices. The computed molecular orbitals and spin densities showed that the unpaired electron is mainly located at the terminal oxygen atom.







Abstract
Group 13 oxyfluorides OMF2 were produced by the reactions of laser&#8208;ablated group 13 atoms M (M=B, Al, Ga and In) with OF2 and isolated in excess neon or argon matrices at 5&#8197;K. These molecules were characterized by matrix&#8208;isolation infrared spectroscopy and isotopic substitution experiments in conjunction with quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. The calculations indicate that the OMF2 molecules have a 2B2 ground state with C2v symmetry. The computed molecular orbitals and spin densities show that the unpaired electron is mainly located at the terminal oxygen atom. Oxo monofluorides OMF were only observed in solid argon matrices and exhibit a linear structure in the singlet ground state. The M&#8722;O bonding in the OMF molecules can be rationalized as highly polar multiple bonds based on the calculated bond lengths and natural resonance theory (NRT) analyses. In particular, the molecular orbitals of OBF exhibit the character of a triple bond B&#8722;O resulting from two degenerate electron&#8208;sharing &#960; bonds and an O&#8594;B dative &#963; bond formed by the oxygen 2p lone pair which donates electron density to the boron empty 2p orbital.

         <title>Oriented External Electric&#8208;Field Effects on the Activation of Aryl CO Bond in Anisole using Rh(PEP) (E=Al, B, Ga) Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum chemical calculations with density functional theory (DFT) demonstrate the effect of Oriented External Electric Field (OEEF) on the heterolytic activation reactions of the C(sp2)&#8722;O bond in aryl ether compounds, such as anisole, catalysed by Rh&#8722;E (E= Al/B/Ga) complexes. New Rh&#8722;E catalyst complexes with improved activity has also been proposed.







Abstract
The present work reports a DFT&#8208;based mechanistic investigation of aryl C&#8722;O bond activation in anisole catalysed by a Rh&#8722;Al pincer&#8208;type complex at room temperature. The study is extended to analogues Rh&#8722;E complexes based on Group&#8197;13 elements (E=B/Ga). Our results show a preference for the heterolytic cleavage pathway over oxidative addition in the C&#8722;O bond activation. The calculated barriers range from 16 to 36&#8197;kcal/mol, following the order: E=Al&lt;E=Ga&lt;E=B. A strong correlation between the activation barriers and the local electric field (LEF) at the Rh metal centre for the studied Rh&#8722;E complexes was observed. Additionally, the ability of Oriented External Electric Field (OEEF) to lower the reaction barrier by applying the OEEF along the direction of electron reorganization, that is, &#8220;the reaction axis&#8221;, was examined. Our results demonstrate the significant effect of applied OEEF on the aryl C&#8722;O bond activation in Rh&#8722;E systems. Furthermore, the effect of OEEF on the C&#8722;O bond activation using modified Rh&#8722;E (E=B, Al, or Ga) complexes, in which electronic structure modifications enable a more efficient barrier control by the OEEF, was showcased. Notably, applying a moderate field strength reduces the high reaction barrier for the Rh&#8722;B system by approximately 13&#8197;kcal/mol.

Meanwhile, a series of corresponding linear cyanido&#8208;bridged pentanuclear compounds [MenCp(dppe)FeIII&#8208;(&#956;&#8208;NC)&#8208;RuII(MeOpy)4&#8208;(&#956;&#8208;NC)&#8208;AgI&#8208;(&#956;&#8208;CN)&#8208;RuII(MeOpy)4&#8208;(&#956;&#8208;CN)&#8208;FeIII(dppe)CpMen][BF4]5 (M[BF4]5, n = 0, M = 4; n = 1, M = 5; n = 3, M = 6) were also obtained and well characterized. The investigations suggest that in the trinuclear system there exists remote interaction between the two Fe centers, but no significant interactions exist across the central silver unit between the metals on the two sides of the silver center in the pentanuclear system. In both the trinuclear N4+ and the pentanuclear M5+ complexes, there exists the neighboring RuII &#8594; FeIII MM'CT transitions, and the MM&#8217;CT energy in the corresponding trinuclear system is higher than those in the pentanuclear system in which no remote metal&#8208;metal interaction occurs. Meanwhile, as the substituted methyl groups on the cyclopentadiene increases, the redox potential of the ruthenium in the trinuclear N4+series increases, but that in the pentanuclear M5+ complexes decreases.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable Fluorescence and Morphology of Aggregates Built from a Mechanically Bonded Amphiphilic Bistable [2]Rotaxane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanically bonded amphiphiles (MBAs), also known as mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs), have emerged as an important kind of functional building block for the construction of artificial molecular machines and soft materials. Herein, a novel MBA, i.e., bistable [2]rotaxane H2 was designed and synthesized. In the solution state, H2 demonstrated pH and metal ion&#8208;responsive emissions due to the presence of a distance&#8208;dependent photoinduced electron transfer (PET) process and the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) process, respectively. Importantly, the amphiphilic feature of H2 has endowed it with unique self&#8208;assembly capability, and nanospheres were obtained in a mixed H2O/CH3CN solvent. Moreover, the morphology of H2 aggregates can be tuned from nanospheres to vesicles due to the pH&#8208;controlled shuttling motion&#8208;induced alternation of H2 amphiphilicity. Interestingly, larger spheres with novel pearl&#8208;chain&#8208;like structures from H2 were observed after adding stoichiometric Zn2+. In particular, H2 shows pH&#8208;responsive emissions in its aggregation state, allowing the visualization of the shuttling movement by just naked eyes. It is assumed that the well&#8208;designed [2]rotaxane, and particularly the proposed concept of MBA shown here, will further enrich the families of MIMs, offering prospects for synthesizing more MIMs with novel assembly capabilities and bottom&#8208;up building dynamic smart materials with unprecedented functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Schlenk&#8208;type Equilibria of Grignard&#8208;analogous Arylberyllium Complexes: Steric Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The presence of complex Schlenk equilibria is a central property of synthetically invaluable Grignard reagents substantially affecting their reactivity and selectivity in chemical transformations. In this work, we systematically studied the steric effects of aryl substituents on the Schlenk&#8208;type equilibria of their lighter congeners, arylberyllium bromides. Combination of diarylberyllium complexes Ar2Be(OEt2) (1Ar, Ar = Tip, Tcpp; Tip = 2,4,6&#8208;iPr3C6H3, Tcpp = 2,4,6&#8208;Cyp3C6H3, Cyp = c&#8208;C5H9), containing sterically demanding aryl groups, and BeBr2(OEt2)2 (2) affords the Grignard&#8208;analogous arylberyllium bromides ArBeBr(OEt2) (3Ar, Ar = Tip, Tcpp). In contrast, Mes2Be(OEt2) (1Mes, Mes = 2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H3) and 2 exist in a temperature&#8208;dependent equilibrium with MesBeBr(OEt2) (3Mes) and free OEt2. Ph2Be(OEt2) (1Ph) reacts with 2 to afford dimeric [PhBeBr(OEt2)]2 ([3Ph]2). Moreover, the influence of replacing the OEt2 donor by an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, IPr2Me2 (IPr2Me2 = C(iPrNCMe)2), on the redistribution reactions was investigated. The solution&#8208; and solid&#8208;state structures of the diarylberyllium and arylberyllium bromide complexes were comprehensively characterized using multinuclear (1H, 9Be, 13C) NMR spectroscopic methods and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, while DFT calculations were employed to support the experimental findings.</dc:description>

         <title>An Acid&#8208;Controlled Method for the Regioselective Functionalization of Anilines over Aliphatic Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regioselective transformations at similar functional groups is of paramount importance in organic synthesis. Traditional strategies towards regioselective functionalization include serial protection/deprotection and sequential synthesis. Modern organic synthesis emphasizes pathway efficiency and protecting group free routes with a goal of exploiting inherent differences in reactivity. Here we report a method for the regioselective functionalization of anilines over aliphatic amines. Utilizing classic conditions for the Baeyer&#8211;Mills reaction, we were able to show that anilines will react preferentially in the presence of aliphatic amines. Subsequently, we illustrate how this principle of reactivity can be extended to other electrophiles and conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Interaction between the transferrin protein and plutonium (and thorium), what&#8217;s new?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transferrin (Tf) is a glycoprotein that transports iron from the serum to the various organs. Several studies have highlighted that Tf can interact with&#160;metals other than&#160;Fe(III), including actinides that are chemical and radiological toxics.&#160;We propose here to report on the behavior of Th(IV) and Pu(IV) in comparison with Fe(III) upon Tf complexation. We considered UV&#8208;Vis and IR data of the M2Tf complex (M = Fe, Th, Pu) and combined experimental EXAFS data with MD models. EXAFS data of the first M&#8208;O coordination sphere are consistent with the MD model considering 1 synergistic carbonate. Further EXAFS data analysis strongly suggests that contamination by Th/Pu colloids seems to occur upon Tf complexation, but it seems limited. SAXS data have also been recorded for all complexes and also after the addition of DFOB in the medium. The Rg values are very close for apoTf, ThTf and PuTf, but slightly larger than for holoTf. Data suggest that the structure of the protein is more ellipsoidal than spherical, with a flattened oblate form. From this data, the following order of conformation size might be considered : holoTf &lt; M2Tf (M = Th, Pu) &lt; apoTf &lt; M2Tf&#8208;DFOB (M = Fe, Th, Pu).</dc:description>

         <title>Design, Synthesis, and Evaluation of Biological Activity of Ferrocene&#8208;Ispinesib Hybrids: Impact of a Ferrocenyl Group on the Antiproliferative and Kinesin Spindle Protein Inhibitory Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ferrocenyl&#8208; and adamantyl&#8208;ispinesib hybrids showing significantly higher anticancer activity than ispinesib were designed. The presence of an ispinesb core is responsible for KSP inhibitory activity, whereas bulky ferrocenyl and adamantyl substituents are responsible for increased ability to ROS generation and significantly increased G2/M phase cell arrest of the new compounds.







Abstract
With the aim to combine more than one biologically&#8208;active component in a single molecule, derivatives of ispinesib and its (S) analogue were prepared that featured ferrocenyl moieties or bulky organic substituents. Inspired by the strong kinesin spindle protein (KSP) inhibitory activity of ispinesib, the compounds were investigated for their antiproliferative activity. Among these compounds, several derivatives demonstrated significantly higher antiproliferative activity than ispinesib with nanomolar IC50 values against cell lines. Further evaluation indicated that the antiproliferative activity is not directly correlated with their KSP inhibitory activity while docking suggested that several of the derivatives may bind in a manner similar to ispinesib. In order to investigate the mode of action further, cell cycle analysis and reactive oxygen species formation were investigated. The improved antiproliferative activity of the most active compounds may be assigned to synergic effects of various factors such as KSP inhibitory activity due to the ispinesib core and ability to generate ROS and induce mitotic arrest.

         <title>[(&#956;3&#8208;F)(BrF5)3]&#8722; &#8211; An Unprecedented Molecular Fluoridobromate(V) Anion in Cs[Br3F16]</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first fluoride&#8208;bridged oligonuclear Br(V) anion, [(&#956;3&#8208;F)(BrF5)3]&#8722;, has been obtained in the compound Cs[Br3F16]. The lone pairs on the Br atoms are shown to be stereochemically active, which has never been observed before for fluoridobromates(V) but only for fluoridoiodates(V).







Abstract
The reaction of Cs[BrF6] with BrF5 gave the compound Cs[Br3F16] with the unprecedented propeller&#8208;shaped, C3&#8208;symmetric [(&#956;3&#8208;F)(BrF5)3]&#8722; anion. All other currently known fluoridobromates(V) contain only octahedral [BrF6]&#8722; anions, which, unlike the related [IF6]&#8722; anions, never exhibited stereochemical activity of the lone pair on the Br atoms. Despite the same coordination number of six for the Br atom in the [BrF6]&#8722; and [(&#956;3&#8208;F)(BrF5)3]&#8722; anions, the longer &#956;3&#8208;F&#8722;Br bonds provide additional space, allowing the lone pairs on the Br atoms to become stereochemically active. Cs[Br3F16] was characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations for both the solid&#8208;state compound and the isolated anion at 0&#8197;K. Intrinsic bond orbital calculations show that the &#956;3&#8208;F&#8722;Br bond is essentially ionic in nature and also underpin the stereochemical activity of the lone pairs of the Br(V) atoms.

Cs[Br&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;] was characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and quantum-chemical calculations for both the solid-state compound and the isolated anion at 0&#8197;K. Intrinsic bond orbital calculations show that the &#956;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-F&#8722;Br bond is essentially ionic in nature and also underpin the stereochemical activity of the lone pairs of the Br(V) atoms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Manipulation of hierarchical chiral self&#8208;assembly and anion recognition by supramolecular systems of &#946;&#8208;glucopyranoside&#65292;Pillar[5]arenes, and Polyoxometalates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hierarchical chiral structures have broad applications in optical devices, asymmetric catalysis, and biological systems. The delicate balance of various interactions are key to the self&#8208;assembly of chiral structures. Herein, a ternary co&#8208;assembly consisting of cationic pillar[5]arenes (P5As), anionic &#946;&#8208;glucopyranoside (&#946;GlcD / &#946;GlcL), and Anderson&#8208;type polyoxometalates (POMs) were constructed. Through adjusting the stoichiometry of &#946;GlcD, the assemblies were effectively controlled to form hierarchical nano&#8208;leaf assemblies with twisted nanoribbons in a homochiral direction. The co&#8208;assemblies exhibit strong Cotton effects, and successfully induced the chirality of Anderson&#8208;type POMs. More interestingly, by changing the central metal in Anderson&#8208;type POMs (XMo6O243&#8208; (X = Cr, Al, and Ga)), even though the three clusters have the same numbers of charge and size, the hierarchical chirality of the related assemblies varied in the morphology of the assemblies and the Cotton effect in the CD spectra. Results in theoretical calculations and ITC titration indicates that the tiny difference in long&#8208;range electrostatic interaction would result in the anion recognition of POMs, modulated by &#946;GlcD through host&#8208;guest inclusion and hydrogen bonding in the assembly process.</dc:description>

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning Aided NO2 Discrimination with an Array of Graphene Chemiresistors Covalently Functionalized by Diazonium Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boosted by the emerging need for highly integrated gas sensors in IoT ecosystems, electronic noses (e&#8208;noses) are gaining interest for the detection of specific molecules over a background of interfering gases. The sensing of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is particularly relevant for applications in environmental monitoring and precision medicine. Here we present an easy and efficient functionalization procedure to covalently modify graphene layers, taking advantage of diazonium chemistry. Separate graphene layers were functionalised with one of three different aryl rings 4&#8208;nitrophenyl, 4&#8208;carboxyphenyl, and 4&#8208;bromophenyl). The distinct mod(ified graphene layers were assembled with a pristine layer into an e&#8208;nose for NO2 discrimination. A remarkable sensitivity to NO2 is demonstrated through exposures to gaseous solutions with NO2 concentrations in the 1&#8208;10 ppm range at room temperature. Then, the discrimination capability of the sensor array is tested by carrying out exposures to several interfering gases and analyzing the data through multivariate statistical analysis. This analysis shows that the e&#8208;nose can discriminate NO2 among all the interfering gases in a two&#8208;dimensional principal component analysis space. Finally, the e&#8208;nose is trained to accurately recognize NO2 contributions with a linear discriminant analysis approach, thus providing a metric for discrimination assessment with a prediction accuracy above 95%.</dc:description>

         <title>Reduced Tiara&#8208;like Palladium Complex for Suzuki Cross Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of highly active and structurally well&#8208;defined catalysts has become a crucial issue for heterogeneous catalysed reactions while reducing the amount of catalyst employed. Beside conventional synthetic routes, the employment of polynuclear transition metal complexes as catalysts or catalyst precursors has progressively intercepted a growing interest. These well&#8208;defined species promise to deliver catalytic systems where a strict control on the nuclearity allows to improve the catalytic performance while reducing the active phase loading. This study describes the development of a very active and reusable palladium&#8208;based catalyst on alumina (Pd8/Al2O3) for Suzuki cross coupling reactions. An octanuclear tiara&#8208;like palladium complex was selected as active phase precursor to give isolated Pd&#8208;clusters of ca. 1 nm in size on Al2O3. The catalyst was thoroughly characterised by several complementary techniques to assess its structural and chemical nature. The high specific activity of the catalyst has allowed to carry out the cross&#8208;coupling reaction in 30 minutes using only 0.12 mol% of Pd loading under very mild and green reaction conditions. Screening of various substrates and selectivity tests, combined with recycling and benchmarking experiments, have been used to highlight the great potentialities of this new Pd8/Al2O3 catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>(Bio)Functionalisation of Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra via Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The surface chemistry of Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra (MOPs) is crucial to their physicochemical properties because it governs how they interact with external substances such as solvents, synthetic organic molecules, metal ions, and even biomolecules. Consequently, the advancement of synthetic methods that facilitate the incorporation of diverse functional groups onto MOP surfaces will significantly broaden the range of properties and potential applications for MOPs. Herein, we describe the use of copper(I)&#8208;catalysed, azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) click reactions to post&#8208;synthetically modify the surface of alkyne&#8208;functionalised cuboctahedral MOPs. To this end, we synthesised a novel Rh(II)&#8208;based MOP with 24&#160;available surface alkyne groups. We have demonstrated that each of the 24 alkyne groups on the surface of our &#8220;clickable&#8221; Rh&#8208;MOP can be reacted with azide&#8208;containing molecules at room temperature, without compromising the integrity of the MOP. We exploited the wide substrate catalogue and orthogonal nature of CuAAC click chemistry to densely functionalise MOPs with diverse functional groups, including polymers, carboxylic and phosphonic acids, and even biotin moieties, which retained their recognition capabilities once anchored onto the surface of the MOP.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of Inverted Ligand Field in the Electronic Structure and Reactivity of Octahedral Formal Platinum (IV) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Platinum complexes are ubiquitous in chemistry and largely used as catalysts or as precursors in drug chemistry, thus a deep knowledge of their electronic properties may help in planning new synthetic strategies or exploring new potential applications. Herein, the electronic structure of many octahedral platinum complexes is drastically revised especially when they feature electronegative elements such as halogens and chalcogens. The investigation revealed that in most cases the five d platinum orbitals are invariably full, thus the empty antibonding orbitals, usually localized on the metal, are mainly centered on the ligands, suggesting a questionable assignment of formal oxidation state IV. The analysis supports the occurrence of the Inverted Ligand Field theory in all cases with the only exceptions of the Pt&#8208;F and Pt&#8208;O bonding. The trends for the molecular complexes are mirrored also by the Density of States plots of extended structures featuring octahedral platinum moieties in association with chalcogens atoms. Finally, the oxidative addition of a Se&#8208;Cl linkage to a square platinum complex to achieve an octahedral moiety has been revised in the framework of the Inverted Ligand Field.</dc:description>

         <title>CO2 Activation with Manganese Tricarbonyl Complexes via an H&#8208;Atom Responsive Benzimidazole Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of two manganese tricarbonyl complexes, MnI(HL)(CO)3Br (1a&#8208;Br) and MnI(MeL)(CO)3Br (1b&#8208;Br) (where HL = 2&#8208;(2&#8217;&#8208;pyridyl)benzimidazole; MeL = 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8217;&#8208;pyridy)benzimidazole) and assayed their electrocatalytic properties for CO2 reduction. A redox&#8208;active pyridine benzimidazole ancillary ligand in complex 1a&#8208;Br displayed unique hydrogen atom transfer ability to facilitate electrocatalytic CO2 conversion at a markedly lower reduction potential than that observed for 1b&#8208;Br.&#160; Notably, a one&#8208;electron reduction of 1a&#8208;Br yields a structurally characterized H&#8208;bonded binuclear Mn(I) adduct (2a&#8217;) rather than the typically observed Mn(0)&#8208;Mn(0) dimer, suggesting a novel method for CO2 activation. Combining advanced electrochemical, spectroscopic, and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction techniques, we demonstrate the use of an H&#8208;atom responsive ligand may reveal an alternative, low&#8208;energy pathway for CO2 activation by an earth&#8208;abundant metal complex catalyst.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of two manganese tricarbonyl complexes, MnI(HL)(CO)3Br (1a-Br) and MnI(MeL)(CO)3Br (1b-Br) (where HL = 2-(2&#8217;-pyridyl)benzimidazole; MeL = 1-methyl-2-(2&#8217;-pyridy)benzimidazole) and assayed their electrocatalytic properties for CO2 reduction. A redox-active pyridine benzimidazole ancillary ligand in complex 1a-Br displayed unique hydrogen atom transfer ability to facilitate electrocatalytic CO2 conversion at a markedly lower reduction potential than that observed for 1b-Br.&#160; Notably, a one-electron reduction of 1a-Br yields a structurally characterized H-bonded binuclear Mn(I) adduct (2a&#8217;) rather than the typically observed Mn(0)-Mn(0) dimer, suggesting a novel method for CO2 activation. Combining advanced electrochemical, spectroscopic, and single crystal X-ray diffraction techniques, we demonstrate the use of an H-atom responsive ligand may reveal an alternative, low-energy pathway for CO2 activation by an earth-abundant metal complex catalyst.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Recent Developments on Photochemical Synthesis of 1,n&#8208;Dicarbonyls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,n&#8208;dicarbonyls, having immense applications in the pharmaceutical industry owing to their fascinating attributes and biological activity, have been exploited as versatile building blocks in synthetic organic chemistry. The recent advancement on assembly of 1,n&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds via different photochemical modes of reaction has been documented in this review.







Abstract
1,n&#8208;dicarbonyls are one of the most fascinating chemical feedstocks finding abundant usage in the field of pharmaceuticals. Besides, they are utilized in a plethora of synthesis in general synthetic organic chemistry. A number of &#8216;conventional&#8217; methods are available for their synthesis, such as the Stetter reaction, Baker&#8208;Venkatraman rearrangement, oxidation of vicinal diols, and oxidation of deoxybenzoins, synonymous with unfriendly reagents and conditions. In the last 15&#8197;years or so, photocatalysis has taken the world of synthetic organic chemistry by a remarkable renaissance. It is fair to say now that everybody loves the light and photoredox chemistry has opened a new gateway to organic chemists towards milder, more simpler alternatives to the previously available methods, allowing access to many sensitive reactions and products. In this review, we present the readers with the photochemical synthesis of a variety of 1,n&#8208;dicarbonyls. Diverse photocatalytic pathways to these fascinating molecules have been discussed, placing special emphasis on the mechanisms, giving the reader an opportunity to find all these significant developments in one place.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of BODIPY&#8208;Hetero[5]helicenes as Heavy&#8208;Atom&#8208;Free Triplet Photosensitizers for Photodynamic Therapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicenes have been synthesized by fusing BODIPY and hetero[5]helicene structures. All the fused compounds have helical structures and their twisting angles are also increased by substitutions at the boron centre. The BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicenes show superior optical properties and high singlet&#8208;oxygen generation capacities that increase proportionally with their twisting angle.







Abstract
Designing heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free triplet photosensitizers (PSs) is a challenge for the efficient photodynamic therapy (PDT) of cancer. Helicenes are twisted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with an efficient intersystem crossing (ISC) that is proportional to their twisting angle. But their difficult syntheses and weak absorption profile in the visible spectral region restrict their use as heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free triplet PSs for PDT. On the other hand, boron&#8208;containing PAHs, BODIPYs are highly recognized for their outstanding optical properties. However, planar BODIPY dyes has low ISC and thus they are not very effective as PDT agents. We have designed and synthesized fused compounds containing both BODIPY and hetero[5]helicene structures to develop red&#8208;shifted chromophores with efficient ISC. One of the pyrrole units of the BODIPY core was also replaced by a thiazole unit to further enhance the triplet conversion. All the fused compounds have helical structure, and their twisting angles are also increased by substitutions at the boron centre. The helical structures of the BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicenes were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography and DFT structure optimization. The designed BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicenes showed superior optical properties and high ISC with respect to [5]helicene. Interestingly their ISC efficiencies increase proportionally with their twisting angles. This is the first report on the relationship between the twisting angle and the ISC efficiency in twisted BODIPY&#8208;based compounds. Theoretical calculations showed that energy gap of the S1 and T1 states decreases in BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicene as compared to planar BODIPY. This enhances the ISC rate in BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicene, which is responsible for their high generation of singlet oxygen. Finally, their potential applications as PDT agents were investigated, and one BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicene showed efficient cancer cell killing upon photo&#8208;exposure. This new design strategy will be very useful for the future development of heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free PDT agents.
