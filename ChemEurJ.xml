         <title>Highly Diastereoselective Synthesis of Oxindole&#8208;Bearing Pyrroloindoline via Gold Catalyzed Carbophilic Carbene Transfer Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new type of gold catalyzed intermolecular dearomative cyclization reaction between diazo oxindole and tryptamine has been developed by utilizing the combination of L3AuCl/Ag3PO4 (L3 = hexamethyl phosphane triamine) as the catalyst. This method allows for the facile preparation of a series of C&#8208;3&#8208;oxindole fused pyrroloindoline products in moderate to good yields with high diastereoselectivities. A plausible reaction mechanism, involving a cascade process of regioselective nucleophilic addition of the carbophilic gold carbenoid intermediate onto tryptamine, followed by an intramolecular cyclization, has been proposed, in which, the high diastereoselectivity is attributed to a preferred transition state. Moreover, three oxindole&#8208;bearing indolo[2,3&#8208;b] quinoline derivatives were synthesized through dearomative cyclization of homotryptamine derivative 4 with the respective 3&#8208;diazoindolin&#8208;2&#8208;one substrates using a similar strategy. A gram&#8208;scale experiment successfully yielded 1.95g of 3aa in 85% yield with a diastereomeric ratio (dr) of 10.4/1, ultimately enabling a five&#8208;step synthesis of the natural product (&#177;)&#8208;folicanthine.</dc:description>

         <title>Advances of Vanadium&#8208;based Cathodes for Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are promising for energy storage due to their high safety, low cost, and environmental friendliness. Vanadium&#8208;based materials, including vanadium oxides, vanadium sulfides, vanadate, and vanadium carbon composites, have gained attention for their diverse crystal structures, multiple oxidation states, and high theoretical capacities. This review summarizes recent advances in vanadium&#8208;based cathodes, focusing on structural design and modification strategies, such as amorphous structures, defect engineering, conductive carbon matrices, and cation pre&#8208;intercalation to enhance Zn2+ storage. Vanadium oxides and vanadium sulfides offer unique ion diffusion advantages, while vanadate and vanadium carbon composites improve conductivity and stability. Vanadate is highlighted as a critical approach to reduce electrostatic repulsion and facilitate Zn2+ storage. Vanadium carbon composites (V&#8208;MOF derivations, vanadium oxides @ carbon, combined with graphene and conductive polymer) have unique advantages in terms of conductivity, ion diffusion, and structural stability. Emerging materials like VN, VOPO4 and V2CTx are also discussed. Future directions include multi&#8208;guest doping, anion pre&#8208;intercalation, and advanced carbon integration. This review aims to guide the development of high&#8208;performance AZIBs and inspire future research in this field.</dc:description>

         <title>Unexpected Conversion of Tyrosine into a Coumaric Acid Residue at the N&#8208;Terminal Side of an Orexin Peptide Fragment Induced by UV Irradiation.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The presence of reactive species exceeding the physiological self&#8208;defense mechanisms in cells and tissues, known as oxidative stress, usually leads to damage of DNA and proteins. In this work, we analyzed the impact of UV irradiation and radical species from different sources to the Tyr17&#8208;Leu33 segment of orexin A peptide, which is the minimal fragment with affinity for orexin 1 receptor. As a clear oxidation process, we detected the conversion of terminal Tyrosine residue into a mixture of E/Z coumaric acid derivatives. In fact, UV irradiation and nitrosyl radicals were found to selectively induce the deamination of tyrosine into the corresponding olefin derivative, which was confirmed by HPLC&#8208;MS and NMR investigations.</dc:description>

         <title>31P NMR study of P&#8208;chirogenic phosphaphenanthrenes with molecular flexibility tuned by amino acid substituents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>

X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) determined absolute configuration on phosphorus and revealed conformational flexibility of six&#8208;membered oxa&#8208;phospha&#8208;cycle. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations combined with machine learning provided 2&#8211;4 representative conformers from each DSI present in solution. 31P chemical shift of RS DSIs was higher compared to the SS ones.

Peptide&#8208;scaffolded detergents: A hybrid molecular innovation combining scalable synthesis and enhanced solubility. Optimized variant A4B2 excels in thermal stabilization and electron microscopy studies of key membrane proteins, setting the stage for advanced detergent design.







Abstract
Detergents are essential for preserving the structural integrity and functionality of membrane proteins (MPs) outside the biological membrane or in aqueous solution, and thus ensuring accurate biochemical and structural analyses. Here, we introduce peptide&#8208;scaffolded detergents, a novel class of hybrid molecules formed by preassembling detergent monomers with peptides of varying lengths, mediated via Click chemistry. These detergents are characterized by scalable, straightforward synthesis and enhanced solubility. Among the variants, A4B2 emerged as the optimal detergent, demonstrating superior thermal stabilization across a range of G protein&#8208;coupled receptors, including A2AAR, SMO and GLP&#8208;1R. Additionally, A4B2 exhibits a low critical micelle concentration and small micelle size, together making it particularly effective for electron microscopy studies of A2AAR. This innovative design leverages the benefits of peptide&#8208;based and traditional detergents, offering new insights for the development of advanced detergents in MP research.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioconvergent Alkylation Reactions That Construct Chiral Quaternary Carbon Centers and Tune C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp2) Bond Rotation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organocatalytic enantioconvergent alkylation reactions of racemic diastereomers that construct all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters, which ease the rotation of the bond between the central chiral carbon and the dihydrobenzofuranone moiety, have been developed. The products have the benefits of the central chiral center and the flexibly rotatable bond to locate a part of the moieties at various positions for interacting with other molecules.







Abstract
In molecules with central chiral centers functionalized with aryl groups, the rotation of the single bond between the aryl group and the central chiral center may be hindered. Enantioconvergent alkylation reactions of racemic diastereomers to construct all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters resulting in easing of the rotation around the axes are described. We demonstrated that the rotation of the bond between a central chiral carbon center and a dihydrobenzofuranone can be tuned by selection of either a tertiary carbon bearing a hydrogen or a quaternary carbon at the central chiral center. The products have the benefits of a central chiral center and a flexibly rotatable bond, which can facilitate interactions with other molecules.

We demonstrated that the rotation of the bond between a central chiral carbon center and a dihydrobenzofuranone can be tuned by selection of either a tertiary carbon bearing a hydrogen or a quaternary carbon at the central chiral center. The products have the benefits of a central chiral center and a flexibly rotatable bond, which can facilitate interactions with other molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Alkali&#8208;Stable Cations and Anion Exchange Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The widespread deployment of anion exchange membranes (AEMs) energy conversion devices requires AEMs with robust alkaline stability. In the race for alkaline stability, &#8220;cationic athletes&#8221; are forging ahead, and cyclic ammonium&#8208;based AEMs are emerging as frontrunners. This concept summarizes the current state of development among various alkali&#8208;stable cations, offering a forward&#8208;looking perspective on future developments in this field.







Abstract
Anion exchange membranes (AEMs) based energy conversion and storage devices have attracted attention as an innovative technology due to their advantageous alkaline catalytic kinetics and cost&#8208;effectiveness. AEMs play a crucial role in these devices and have shown significant progress in terms of ionic conductivity, mechanical properties, alkaline stability, and other essential characteristics. Nevertheless, their durability remains a limiting factor preventing the large&#8208;scale deployment of AEMs based devices. The attack of hydroxide ions on the cations is an inherent issue that needs to be addressed to enhance the lifetime of the AEMs. Therefore, the design of more stable cationic groups is essential to maintain the initial properties of AEMs and extend the device lifetime. This concept systematically summarizes the development and stability enhancement strategies of the cationic groups for AEMs in recent years, with particular emphasis on the emerging cyclic cationic groups. Furthermore, the stability differences of cations in small molecules versus AEMs are systematically discussed, as well as prospective research toward stable AEMs.

         <title>Novel Space&#8208;Crowded Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer Molecules for the Fabrication of Efficient Blue OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two tailored blue luminscent molecules with through&#8208;space charge transfer feature are synthesized and characterized. They exhibit strong deep blue photoluminescence, and can not only function efficiently as emitters in blue OLEDs but also serves as host materials for blue multi&#8208;resonance emitters, providing narrow blue electroluminescence spectra and excellent device efficiencies.







Abstract
Currently, the advance of high&#8208;resolution display device puts a high requirement for the development of efficient luminescent materials emitting high&#8208;quality blue light. But stable blue luminescent materials with high electroluminescence (EL) efficiencies and narrow emission spectra are still rare. In this work, two efficient blue molecules (mCPTC and 2mCPTC) are developed by linking large&#8208;volume electron donors of 1,3&#8208;bis(N&#8208;carbazolyl)benzene (mCP) and electron acceptor of 2,4&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (DPTRZ) on the 3,6&#8208;di(tert&#8208;butyl)carbazole holder through benzene bridges. Their thermal stability, crystal and electronic structures, energy levels, photophysical property, charge transport ability and EL behaviors are thoroughly studied. They hold high structural rigidity and through&#8208;space charge transfer characteristics between donor and acceptor, and exhibit strong deep blue photoluminescence. They can not only function as emitters in OLEDs to radiate deep blue light, but also serve as efficient hosts for blue multi&#8208;resonance emitter v&#8208;DABNA, providing narrow EL spectra and excellent EL efficiencies of 24.21&#8201;%, much higher than those in common host without sensitizers. These results demonstrate the good potentials of these blue molecules in the fabrication of efficient narrow&#8208;spectrum blue OLEDs.

         <title>Identification of Two Distinct Stereoselective Lysine 5&#8208;Hydroxylases by Genome Mining Based on Alazopeptin Biosynthetic Enzymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymes that catalyze regio&#8208; and stereoselective hydroxylation of amino acids are valuable for pharmaceutical production. Two lysine 5&#8208;hydroxylases (Am_AzpK2 and Pp_AzpK2) that synthesize (2S,5S)&#8208; and (2S,5R)&#8208;5&#8208;hydroxylysine, respectively, were identified by genome mining. Several lysine 5&#8208;hydroxylases in the genome database were also characterized. Stereoselective dehydrogenases for (2S,5S)&#8208; and (2S,5R)&#8208;5&#8208;hydroxylysine were also discovered.







Abstract
Enzymes that catalyze regioselective and stereoselective hydroxylation of amino acids are useful tools for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals. AzpK is an unprecedented lysine 5&#8208;hydroxylase that is involved in alazopeptin biosynthesis, although its enzymatic activity has not been confirmed in&#8197;vitro. Here, we identified two &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate/Fe2+&#8208;dependent dioxygenases in Actinosynnema mirum and Pseudomonas psychrotolerans (Am_AzpK2 and Pp_AzpK2, respectively) as lysine 5&#8208;hydroxylases, using genome mining based on the alazopeptin biosynthetic gene cluster. Interestingly, Am_AzpK2 and Pp_AzpK2 synthesized different isomers, (2S,5S)&#8208; and (2S,5R)&#8208;5&#8208;hydroxylysine, respectively. We also identified two AzpJ homologs as the dehydrogenases that specifically recognize the hydroxy groups of (2S,5S)&#8208; and (2S,5R)&#8208;5&#8208;hydroxylysine to synthesize a keto group. These dehydrogenases were shown to be useful tools for characterizing the stereochemistry of 5&#8208;hydroxylysine and evaluating the activity of lysine 5&#8208;hydroxylases. Furthermore, we identified three lysine 5&#8208;hydroxylases that synthesize (2S,5S)&#8208;5&#8208;hydroxylysine and four lysine 5&#8208;hydroxylases that synthesize (2S,5R)&#8208;5&#8208;hydroxylysine from the genome database. Genome scanning based on lysine 5&#8208;hydroxylases indicated the presence of undiscovered natural products with 5&#8208;hydroxylysine moieties. In conclusion, this study provides a fundamental technology for the stereoselective production of 5&#8208;hydroxylysine. Further analysis of the stereoselective lysine 5&#8208;hydroxylases would reveal how nature establishes highly stereoselective hydroxylation.

         <title>Identification of Natural Killer Cell Enhancers Through Mimicking of the Tumor Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ability of natural killer (NK) cells to identify and eliminate cancer cells is reduced within the tumor microenvironment (TME), allowing cancer to evade detection and eradication by immune cells. We developed a novel co&#8208;culture assay that replicates the immunosuppressive TME conditions to facilitate the discovery of compounds that can prevent NK cell inhibition and identified effective modulators, with different mechanisms of action.







Abstract
The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a pro&#8208;cancerous niche harboring immunosuppressive factors that are secreted by cancer cells and the surrounding cancer&#8208;supportive tissue, such as kynurenine, prostaglandin E2 and transforming growth factor &#946; (TGF&#946;). These factors dampen the activity of cytotoxic lymphocytes like natural killer (NK) cells, allowing evasion of immune cell&#8208;mediated killing. To identify small molecules that counteract the immunosuppressive effect of the TME and restore NK cell&#8208;mediated cytotoxicity, we developed a phenotypic co&#8208;culture assay of cancer cells and primary lymphocytes suitable for medium&#8208;throughput screening. We discovered small molecules that restore NK cell&#8208;mediated cytotoxicity through diverse mechanisms. The potent TGF&#946; type I receptor (TGF&#946;R&#8208;1) inhibitor, RepSox, stood out as superior to other TGF&#946;R&#8208;1 inhibitors due to its ability to abolish the effects of both inhibitory factors used in our setup. This mode of action goes beyond TGF&#946;R&#8208;1 inhibition and is related to the simultaneous abrogation of cyclooxygenase 1 (COX1) activity.

The computed photophysical properties of recently synthesized Pd&#8211; and Pt&#8211;isocorroles, allow us to indicate these compounds as possible candidates in photodynamic therapy. In particular, Density Functional Theory results clearly show that the Pt&#8208;10 and Pd&#8208;10 complexes are able to generate of excited O2 (1&#916;g) and superoxide O2.(&#8722;) via type I and type II reactions.







Abstract
The main photophysical properties of recently synthesized Pd&#8211; and Pt&#8211;isocorroles, characterized and proposed as potential photosensitizers in photodynamic therapy, have been investigated and rationalized using density functional theory and its time&#8208;dependent formulation. Both the 5 and 10&#8208;(2&#8208;pyrrolyl)&#8208;5,10,15&#8208;tris(4&#8208;methylphenyl) isomers have been considered. In addition to determining the minimum energy structures of the ground and excited states, we have calculated the excitation energies, spin&#8208;orbit coupling constants, nonradiative intersystem crossing rate constants and two photons cross section. Also, the type I PDT mechanisms have been considered. Results show that the photoactivity of both Pd and Pt complexes mainly depends on their singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap, which is necessary to promote the O2

 excitation. The study of the photophysical properties of the free ligands indicates that this trend is common for both the free and Pt&#8211; and Pd&#8211;isocorroles. The production of superoxide ions (O2.(&#8722;)) is possible only for the 10&#8208;(2&#8208;pyrrolyl)&#8208;5,10,15&#8208;tris(4&#8208;methylphenyl) isomers.

         <title>Implicating the Role of Au&#8722;H Bonds in Photochemical N2 Fixation by Ruthenium&#8208;Doped Gold Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

N2 reduction to NH3 on Au22Ru6 cluster without sacrificial reagent. The Ru&#8208;doped Au cluster effectively reduces N2 molecule to NH3 only in the presence of UV&#8208;Vis light in aqueous medium under ambient pressure and temperature conditions owing to the bifunctional nature of that nanocluster. The Ru dopant of the bimetallic Au22Ru6 cluster assists in binding the N2 molecule while the Au&#8722;H bonds formed from Au&#8208;assisted water splitting are involved in facilitating nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR).







Abstract
Dinitrogen fixation through the Nitrogen Reduction Reaction (NRR) under mild conditions without the use of sacrificial agents has its share of formidable hurdles. It has been shown recently that Ru&#8208;doped Au nanoclusters can reduce N2 molecules to NH3 only in the presence of UV&#8208;Vis light in aqueous medium. Herein, using theoretical techniques (Density Functional Theory), we shed light on the mechanistic avenues traversed to achieve this prodigious chemical feat. Our findings suggest that the bimetallic Au22Ru6 cluster successfully accomplishes the NRR process under ambient pressure and temperature conditions by the virtue of its bifunctional nature. Contrary to the existing views, we find that NRR propagates through an alternative associative pathway, where the Ru dopant assists in N2 adsorption while the Au&#8722;H bonds formed from Au&#8208;assisted water splitting are implicated in facilitating NRR.

         <title>Crystal Phase Engineering of TiO2 for Efficient Photocatalytic Non&#8208;oxidative Methane Coupling</title>

Crystal phase engineering of TiO2 via thermal annealing of Ti metal&#8208;organic frameworks can afford high photocatalytic non&#8208;oxidative coupling of methane performance.







Abstract
Photocatalytic non&#8208;oxidative coupling of methane (NOCM) is an appealing approach to produce ethane and hydrogen, however, most developed photocatalysts still suffer from low activity. Here, we demonstrate that the crystal phase engineering of TiO2 via thermal annealing of Ti metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) can afford high photocatalytic NOCM performance in a flow reactor under UV&#8208;visible light irradiation. The characterization results show that engineering the TiO2 crystal phase can improve the separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers and promote the formation of &#8901;CH3 intermediate, thus achieving the improved performance of photocatalytic NOCM reaction. This research provides a new perspective towards the design and construction of efficient photocatalysts for NOCM reaction.

         <title>Adding Value into Elementary Sulfur for Sustainable Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent advancements in synthesis strategy that leverage sulfur and sulfur&#8208;based reactions to produce sustainable materials. The materials have promising applications across energy, optics, engineering, and environmental sectors, offering a forward&#8208;looking perspective on the opportunities and challenges shaping this rapidly evolving field.







Abstract
Sulfur&#8208;rich copolymers, characterized by high sulfur contents and dynamic disulfide bonds, show significant promise as sustainable alternatives to conventional carbon&#8208;based plastics. Since the advent of inverse vulcanization in 2013, numerous synthesis strategies have emerged &#8211; ranging from thermopolymerization and photoinduced polymerization to the use of crosslinkers such as mercaptans, episulfides, benzoxazines, and cyclic disulfides. These advancements coupled with the rising demand for degradable plastics have driven research for diverse applications, including optical windows, metal uptake, and adhesives. Due to the unique electronic properties of sulfur&#8208;rich materials, they are promising candidates for cathodes in Li&#8722;S batteries and triboelectric nanogenerators. This review highlight the latest exciting ways of synthesis strategy in which sulfur and sulfur&#8208;based reactions are bing utilized to produce sustainable materials in energy, optics, engeneering material, environemtal, and triboelectric nanogenerators. Finally, this review provides a forward&#8208;looking perspective on the opportunities and challenges shaping this rapidly evolving field.

         <title>Synthesis and Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Luminescent Properties of Phenylene&#8208;Bridged and Non&#8208;Bridged Boron &#946;&#8208;Dialdiminate Dimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dimerization of the boron &#946;&#8208;dialdiminate complex provides valuable functional luminescence properties, like solvatochromism, mechanochromism and phosphorescence, which are absent in the parent single molecule. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest that delicately balanced intramolecular electronic interactions should impart the specific excited state characteristics leading to those luminescent behaviors.







Abstract
We report synthesis and optical properties of the dimers of boron &#946;&#8208;dialdiminate (DAI) complexes with different connection manners. The series of dimers, o&#8208;, m&#8208;, p&#8208; and d&#8208;BisDAI, were prepared, and their photophysical properties were compared with the single unit, DAI. It was found that the dimers show characteristic optical properties: o&#8208;BisDAI showed bathochromic shifts in absorption and emission spectra and emission quenching because of the through&#8208;space interactions, while the photophysical properties of m&#8208;BisDAI and DAI were almost identical. The extension of &#960;&#8208;conjugation in p&#8208;BisDAI could induce not only the bathochromic shifts of its absorption and emission bands but also the solvatochromism originating from the symmetry&#8208;breaking charge transfer character. d&#8208;BisDAI showed the weak low&#8208;energy emission in solution and the mechanochromic luminescence which might stem from the rotational degree of freedom between the adjacent two DAI units.

         <title>Fine Tuning of Hybridized Local and Charge&#8208;Transfer Excited States and Luminescence in Carbazole/Benzothiadiazole Isomeric Emitters by Varying Linking Mode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By varying the linkage of carbazole donor from 3&#8208; to 2&#8208;site onto the benzothiadiazole acceptor in two isomeric HLCT emitters, the D&#8722;A dihedral angle is reduced, which not only reduces the HOMO delocalization and the charge transfer effect and causes fluorescence blue shift by 30&#8197;nm, but also increases molecular rigidity and improves PLQY to about 90&#8201;%. Green doped OLED of 2&#8208;site isomer exhibits high EQE of 5.79&#8201;%, being one of the best efficiencies for green HLCT materials based on benzothiadiazole acceptor.







Abstract
Hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) type emitters can harvest triplet excitons for light emission via high&#8208;lying reverse intersystem crossing (hRISC), showing great potential for application in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Herein, two isomeric emitters NPC3BTD and NPC2BTD were developed by linking two 9&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole (NPC) donors onto the central benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BTD) acceptor. By tuning the linkage from 3&#8208;site to 2&#8208;site of carbazole ring, the D&#8722;A dihedral angle was decreased, then the HOMO delocalization and CT/LE content ratio in HLCT excited states were reduced, thus NPC2BTD revealed fluorescence hypsochromic shift by 30&#8197;nm to green region. Simultaneously, the molecular rigidity was increased and non&#8208;radiative transition was suppressed, thus the photoluminescence quantum yield was increased to about 90&#8201;%. Their HLCT excited state nature was verified by the natural transition orbitals results and detection of two different excited dipole moments in various solvents. It is supposed the hRISC occur from T2 to S1 states. Yellow and green doped OLEDs of NPC3BTD and NPC2BTD exhibited external quantum efficiencies of 5.31&#8201;% and 5.79&#8201;% with exciton utilization efficiency of 36.12&#8201;% and 32.42&#8201;%. The superior performance of NPC2BTD over NPC3BTD was attributed to the finely tuned HLCT excited states through structure isomerization.

         <title>Base&#8208;Induced Apparent Inverted Solvatochromism in Pyridinium Phenolates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effect of base choice on the solvatochromism of &#960;&#8208;extended pyridinium&#8208;phenolate dyes was investigated. UV&#8208;vis absorption spectra revealed that methanolic tetrabutylammonium hydroxide causes apparent inverted solvatochromism in negatively solvatochromic dyes. Based on these findings, recommendations have been made for methodologies used to compare novel solvatochromic dyes against benchmark dyes.







Abstract
Due to conflicting reports regarding the solvatochromism of &#960;&#8208;extended pyridinium&#8208;phenolate dyes, the choice of base (N,N,N&#8216;,N&#8216;&#8208;tetramethylguanidine or 1&#8197;M tetrabutylammonium hydroxide in methanol) used to deprotonate the dyes was investigated. Three known dyes were synthesized and their UV&#8208;vis absorbance spectra were measured in a range of solvent using the two bases and the zwitterionic forms of the dyes. It was found that the methanolic tetrabutylammonium hydroxide could cause the appearance of inverted solvatochromism in negatively solvatochromic dyes when used in solvents of sufficiently low polarity. This was attributed to the presence of the polar, hydrogen bond donating methanol which preferentially solvates the dye, increasing the polarity it observes. Informed by these results, recommendations are presented for the methods used to compare solvatochromic dyes.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report how with simple spectroscopic technic we could obtain clear evidence of narcissistic H&#8208;bonds self&#8208;sorting during supramolecular polymerization of a judiciously designed monomer endowing urea and amide functions.







Abstract
In this study, we unambiguously evidence, by mean of UV&#8208;Vis and NMR technics supported by theoretical calculations, that a narcissistic H&#8208;bond self&#8208;sorting takes place during supramolecular polymerization of a newly designed monomer equipped with mixed urea/amide H&#8208;bond donor/acceptor moieties.

         <title>Isolation of a Rare Terminal Zr(IV) Peroxide and Insight into Polyoxovanadate Support Impact on Thioether Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lability of a terminal methoxide on a zirconium&#8208;doped polyoxovanadate&#8208;alkoxide (POV&#8208;alkoxide) is demonstrated through pKa driven reactions. Single crystals of the decorated ZrPOV&#8208;alkoxide are reported which include a rare monomeric Zr&#8208;peroxo species. The POV metalloligand serves as an electron&#8208;rich scaffold allowing the Zr to engage in electrophilic oxidation of thioethers via hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant.







Abstract
Substitutional lability of the terminal methoxide ligand on a Zr(IV) substituted polyoxovanadate&#8208;alkoxide (POV&#8208;alkoxide) via protonolysis is presented. Addition of excess water or stoichiometric 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethanol results in the exchange of the terminal methoxide ligand for a hydroxide or 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethoxide ligand, respectively. The lability of the terminal methoxide ligand at zirconium is leveraged to access a relatively stable terminal peroxide bound to a POV&#8208;alkoxide supported Zr(IV) center, via addition of hydrogen peroxide adducts compatible with organic solvent. Isolation of the terminal peroxide complex allows for investigation into the impact of the sterically protected, electron&#8208;rich POV&#8208;alkoxide support on the activation of hydrogen peroxide at Zr(IV). While the isolated peroxide complex is inactive towards the oxidation of thioethers, the methoxy terminated Zr(IV) functions as a precatalyst for the reaction. Mechanistic analysis reveals electrophilic oxidation conditions with hydrogen peroxide substrates, with a nucleophilic parameter (

&#967;Nu

 ${{{{\bf\chi}}}_{{\bf N u}}}$



) of 0.09&#177;0.02. In thioether oxidation reactions, selectivity for sulfoxide products (95&#8211;99&#8201;%) in acetonitrile is observed, suggesting the use of a reduced POV&#8208;alkoxide prevents over&#8208;oxidation of substrate.

         <title>Adjustability and Versatility of Molecular Packing Patterns in Asymmetric Coumarin Liquid Crystals Supramolecular Helical Column Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coumarin asymmetric multi&#8208;chain liquid crystals were synthesized using click reaction. The findings indicate that the polarities of both the linkages and the solvents play a critical role in the formation of supramolecular nanostructures. DFT calculations are performed to theoretically study such as geometric structure, FMOs, molecular electrostatic potential, and dipole moment.







Abstract
Coumarin asymmetric multi&#8208;chain liquid crystals (LCs) were synthesized using click reaction, with coumarin core and 1,2,3&#8208;triazole dendritic wings on both sides. The properties of these LCs and the resulting gels were investigated using polarized optical microscopy (POM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). These polycatenars demonstrate the ability to self&#8208;assemble into columnar LCs phases, exhibiting p4&#8197;mm symmetry in their bulk states. In DMF solvent, ether compounds yield gels with notably more ordered, spherical flower&#8208;like morphologies, while ester compounds produce gels that are less ordered and exhibit a nanosphere morphology. The findings indicate that the polarities of both the linkages and the solvents play a critical role in the formation of supramolecular nanostructures. Interestingly, the 2 was proved as promising imaging probe for latent fingerprints (LFPs) and fluorescent fingerprints images were obtained with high&#8208;resolution, which showed potential practical application for LFPs detection. Additionally, LCs compounds are used as dopants to modify the poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene (PEDOT:PSS) injection layer of Organic silicone&#8208;based heterojunction solar cells (HSCs). Finally, Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed to theoretically study such as geometric structure, frontier molecular orbitals, molecular electrostatic potential, and dipole moment.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of N&#8208;doped Porous Carbon Materials Derived from Bombyx Mori Silk for High&#8208;Performance Symmetric Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heteroatom doping and structural modification can significantly improve the electrochemical properties of carbon materials, but it is difficult to achieve synchronous control of the two. To this end, N&#8208;doped porous carbon material (BCNK) was synthesized using bombyx mori silk as carbon source, melamine and KHCO3 as activators. When only melamine is added, the prepared carbon material (BCN) only increases the heteroatom content. When only KHCO3 is added, the prepared carbon material (BCK) only increases the specific surface area and pore volume. The microstructure and heteratom content of carbon materials can be controlled simultaneously by adding two activators at the same time. Electrochemical tests show that the electrochemical performance of BCNK is higher than that of BCN and BCK. It is worth mentioning that the specific surface area of BCNK is much lower than that of BCK, and the heteroatom content is higher than that of BCK, indicating that increasing the heteroatom content is more conducive to achieving excellent electrochemical performance than increasing the specific surface area. This study not only provides a new way for the application of silk in supercapacitors, but also enables researchers to re&#8208;understand the relationship between the structure and electrochemical properties of carbon materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Fabrication of Nanoparticles and Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts via Cathodic Corrosion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While cathodic corrosion may appear as an undesired degradation process at electrode surfaces, it has emerged to a powerful electrochemical method for the fabrication of nanoparticles and single&#8208;atom catalysts. Different from traditional wet chemical synthesis, cathodic corrosion affords rapid, straightforward, capping&#8208;agent&#8208;free production of nanoparticles, enabling fine control over size, shape, and elemental composition. This mini&#8208;review summarizes recent advances in cathodic corrosion&#8208;based synthesis, emphasizing its unique capabilities for producing metallic, alloyed, and oxide nanoparticles, as well as single&#8208;atom catalysts. It explores the effects of varying parameters such as electrode material, electrolyte composition, voltage waveform, and frequency on the characteristics of the generated particles. Furthermore, it highlights the enhanced electrocatalytic or photoelectrocatalytic performance of the nanoparticles produced via cathodic corrosion.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Acetylenic Scaffolds Modeling Segments of 6,6,12&#8208;Graphyne</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>6,6,12&#8208;Graphyne is an all&#8208;carbon network formally generated by interspersing sp&#8208; and sp2&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms between the carbon hexagons of graphene. Tetraethynylethene (TEE) is one structural unit that can be identified as bridging the benzene rings in 6,6,12&#8208;graphyne. Here we present the synthesis by stepwise Sonogashira couplings of TEE scaffolds that can be considered as small model systems of 6,6,12&#8208;graphyne segments. Electrochemical studies of the scaffolds revealed that they are weaker electron acceptors than related, but smaller, radiaannulene oligomers that were previously studied as relevant model systems of other 6,6,12&#8208;graphyne segments. The connectivity of the TEE units in these acyclic oligomers plays a role for their acceptor strengths according to experiments and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. Moreover, optical studies reveal redshifted longest&#8208;wavelength absorptions as the oligomer length increases, but only to a small degree when moving from dimer to trimer structures. Experimental results were complemented by calculated absorption and redox properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Elucidation using Highly Sensitive Labeling Reagents and Total Synthesis of a New Anoikis Inducer Amoxetamide A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amoxetamide A is a new anoikis inducer identified in the combined&#8208;culture broth of Amycolatopsis sp. 26&#8208;4 and Tsukamurella pulmonis TP&#8208;B0596. Although its planar structure has been determined through extensive NMR studies, its stereochemical structure remains to be elucidated due to the limited amounts of available samples. Herein, we report its stereochemical determination using our original labeling reagents and chemical synthesis, which was realized by consuming trace amount (ca 10 &#956;g) of natural sample. Moreover, the total synthesis of amoxetamide A is reported. Undesired intramolecular cyclization of an intermediate accelerated by the Thorpe&#8211;Ingold effect was completely avoided by using acyl sulfonamide as a protecting group of carboxylic acid. This first total synthesis of amoxetamide A enabled the confirmation of its stereochemistry and anoikis inducing activity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, we introduce a mild and operationally simple visible&#8208;light photochemical&#160;protocol for the synthesis of novel&#160;glycopeptides mimetics. This method capitalizes on the reaction between 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridine (DHP) containing amino acids and peptides with glycosyl nitrones, showing exceptional stereoselectivity and robust performance across a diverse array of substrates, encompassing both modified glycosides and intricate peptide structures. Furthermore, we underscore the versatility of the resultant compounds through their seamless integration and utility in bioconjugation strategies.</dc:description>

         <title>Sustainable diesel from rapeseed oil esters by sequential semi&#8208;hydrogenation, double bond isomerization, and metathesis.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rapeseed oil methyl esters (RME) have been converted to biofuel with a boiling point curve that fulfills the EN 590 specifications for modern diesel engines using a robust, three&#8208;step process. In the first step, the polyunsaturated esters of the RME were semi&#8208;hydrogenated in the presence of 20 ppm of a solvent&#8208;stabilized Pd0 colloid. The resulting mono&#8208;unsaturated fatty esters were further converted into a defined mixture of double&#8208;bond isomers by passing them over inexpensive, Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acidic Amberlyst resin at high space&#8208;time yields (1.3 kg&#183;L&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1). The resulting mixture was then converted into a blend of terminally unsaturated olefins and monoesters, with &lt;4.9% diesters and &lt;21% saturated fatty esters by cross&#8208;metathesis with technical&#8208;grade ethylene. In this step, 50 ppm of a cyclic alkyl amino carbene (CAAC) Ru catalyst M1001 was used to achieve record&#8208;setting conversions (91%) and selectivities (94%). All three steps were conducted with neat feedstock at mild temperatures (60&#8211;100 &#176;C). This demonstrates that sustainable diesel fuel for use in contemporary diesel engines is accessible from RME and ethylene via a short set of industrially viable reaction steps.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimal Stapling of a Helical Peptide&#8208;Foldamer Hybrid Using a C&#8208;terminal 4&#8208;Mercaptoproline Enhances Protein Surface Recognition and Cellular Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Structural analysis of a co&#8208;crystal of a helically&#8208;folded peptide&#8208;foldamer hybrid in complex with hDM2 E3 ubiquitin ligase, revealed a unique orientation for the C&#8208;terminal proline with the pyrrolidine ring pointing backwards in the sequence, and suggested new opportunities for macrocyclization. In particular, we found that the C&#8208;terminal prolyl residue could be replaced by its (2S,4S)&#8208;4&#8208;mercaptoprolyl analogue for optimal bisthioether crosslinking with a cysteine residue installed at position 4 in the sequence. The resulting i,i+7 stapled peptide&#8208;foldamer is a high&#8208;affinity binder to hDM2, is cell permeable and restores the p53 signalling pathway in p53wt cancer cells. The co&#8208;crystal structure of hDM2 and the stapled peptide&#8208;foldamer hybrid was determined at 1.84 &#197;, fully validating the original design and further highlighting the potential of cis&#8208;4&#8208;mercaptoproline in the context of peptide and foldamer stapling.</dc:description>

         <title>Spin Crossover Composite Film as Recyclable Catalyst for Acetalization Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, the fabrication and characterization of the composite material [Fe(NH2trz)3](NO3)2 @TPU is presented. The spin&#8208;crossover iron complex embedded within it efficiently catalyzes the formation of acetal. This catalyst can be easily recovered and reused several times without significant loss of efficiency. Additionally, the color of the material indicates whether the film can be reused for catalysis or not.







Abstract
Polymer&#8208;based composite films represent a promising approach for developing recyclable catalysts. In this study, a [Fe(NH2trz)3](NO3)2 @TPU composite film with spin crossover properties was fabricated using the blade casting method. Various characterisation techniques confirmed the uniform distribution of [Fe(NH2trz)3](NO3)2 particles within the TPU matrix, while maintaining the spin&#8208;crossover properties of the embedded complex. The composite film exhibited excellent catalytic efficiency and reusability in acetalization reaction, enabling efficient catalysis for up to 11 cycles under batch conditions and sustained activity for 7&#8197;hours under flow conditions. In addition, the color of the film served as a convenient visual indicator of its suitability for reuse in subsequent catalytic reactions. This study demonstrates that [Fe(NH2trz)3](NO3)2 @TPU composite film can serve as an effective and recyclable catalysts for acetalization reactions.

         <title>Photoinduced Radical Luminescence of Diazapyrene Derivatives upon Complexation with Cucurbit[n]uril Hosts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The CB[n]&#8208;based host&#8208;guest complexation regulates the luminescence of D&#8722;A type diazapyrene radical cations by enhancing their stabilities, prolonging their fluorescence lifetimes, and increasing their quantum yields.







Abstract
Molecular design with an electron donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) structure and host&#8208;guest complexation are effective strategies for stabilizing radicals. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of cationic diazapyrene derivatives featuring a D&#8722;A structure, as well as the influence of host&#8208;guest complexation on their photoinduced organic radical photophysical properties. Compared to the methylated diazapyrene 1, the other three derivatives 2&#8211;4, containing triphenylamine, coumarin, and naphthalene units as D groups, respectively, are more favorable for the generation of radicals. Binding studies reveal that cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) forms 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 inclusion complexes with derivatives 2&#8211;4, while CB[10] forms a 2&#8201;:&#8201;2 inclusion complex with 2 and supramolecular polymers with 3 and 4. The radical luminescence of derivatives 1&#8211;4 in aqueous solution is significantly promoted upon complexation with CB[8] or CB[10]. Additionally, the emission color of 3 shifts from cyan to yellow&#8208;green upon light irradiation in the presence of CB[8].

         <title>Functionalized Thorium&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for the Photocatalytic Oxidation of 1, 5&#8208;Dihydroxynaphthalene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is still a challenging task to rationally design metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) crystal catalysts with excellent light absorption and charge transfer for efficient photocatalytic reactions. In this work, the hexanuclear thorium clusters, porphyrin derivative ligands, and linear carboxylic acid ligands were assemed into Th&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Th6&#8208;TCPP, Th6&#8208;Co&#8208;TCPP, and Th6&#8208;Ni&#8208;TCPP) by the mixed ligand method. The three prepared MOF crystals were applied in the photocatalytic oxidation of 1, 5&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene (1, 5&#8208;DHN) for the synthesis of juglone. Among them, Th6&#8208;TCPP exhibited optimum photodynamic activity for production of reactive oxygen species. Under lillumination, Th6&#8208;TCPP resulted in photochemical reaction conversion rate up to 95% for 9, 10&#8208;diphenylanthracene (DPA) and 54.5% for 1, 5&#8208;DHN. The good catalytic effect was attributed to the large conjugate system of porphyrin and the enhanced photosensitivity of bipyridine.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Amination of 1,2&#8208;Diol through Borrowing Hydrogen: Synthesis of Vicinal Amino &#945;&#8208;Tertiary Alcohol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methods to prepare vicinal amino alcohols are important because of their presence in biologically active compounds. Despite the development of various methods for vicinal amino alcohol synthesis, C(sp3)&#8208;rich oxygen&#8208;containing&#160;&#946;&#8208;amine compounds continue to pose great challenge. While ring&#8208;opening reaction of epoxides with amine nucleophile is the prime method for vicinal amino alcohol preparation, epoxides are highly reactive and sometimes difficult to make, resulting in drawbacks regarding selectivity of this approach. Here, we report a catalytic enantio&#8208;convergent amination of &#945;&#8208;tertiary 1,2&#8208;diols for the efficient access to vicinal amino &#945;&#8208;tertiary alcohols. The racemic &#945;&#8208;tertiary 1,2&#8208;diol substrates of different alkyl/aryl or alkyl/alkyl backbone, can be converted to chiral vicinal amino a&#8208;tertiary alcohols through diphenyl phosphate&#8208;mediated RuCl3 catalysed asymmetric borrowing hydrogen (ABH) pathway. This simple ABH reaction can be scaled up to the synthesis of chiral ligands, synthetic intermediates, and other medicinally&#8208;relevant compounds. Overall, this catalytic redox&#8208;neutral procedure broadens the scope of Ru&#8208;catalysed amination of alcohols and discloses an underexplored step&#8208; and atom&#8208;economical synthetic strategy for the synthesis of vicinal amino &#945;&#8208;tertiary alcohols and provides a practicable alternative to the present benchmark procedures.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous Construction of Axial and Central Stereogenicity by Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Stereoconvergent Reductive Coupling of Heterobiaryl Triflates and Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic stereoconvergent coupling of racemic heterobiaryl triflates and aldehydes promoted by a readily available chiral cobalt complex is presented. Such processes represent an unprecedented reaction pathway for cobalt catalysis that enable simultaneous construction of axial and central stereogenicity through diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective dynamic kinetic transformations and introduction of a chiral fragment onto the heterobiaryl cores without the requirement of preforming stoichiometric amounts of organometallic reagents, affording densely functionalized secondary alcohols in up to 96% yield, &gt;98:2 dr and &gt;99.5:0.5 er. Preliminary investigations on the application of the products demonstrate their potential for serving as a new class of chiral catalysts and ligands. Mechanistic studies suggest that a dynamic kinetic stereoselective process induced by chiral cobalt catalysis is involved.</dc:description>

         <title>Adaptive Coordination Behavior of Bisphosphanylphosphanido&#8208;Ligands toward Group 2, 11 and 12 Metal Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of alkaline earth metal complexes (Mg&#8208;Ba) with the anionic ferrocenylene&#8208;bridged bisphosphanylphosphanide ligand [Fe(C5H4PC4H9)2P]&#8722; has been prepared by metalation of the corresponding bisphosphanylhydrophosphane (Fe(C5H4PC4H9)2PH). The resulting complexes have been characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and SC&#8208;XRD. Furthermore, the closely related zinc phosphanide, and rare, mononuclear coinage metal phosphanides were synthesized and investigated for comparison. The range of coordination modes observed for the phosphanide ligand included mono&#8208;, bi&#8208;, and tridentate modi and their respective combinations, whereas no &#956;2&#8208;bridging of the phosphanide center has been observed. The value of the 1JPP coupling constant was found to be a good probe to track the coordination motif consistent with the situation in solid state.</dc:description>

         <title>Twisted Amide&#8208;Mediated Synthesis and Rapid Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship Study of Medium&#8208;Sized Cyclic Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Medium&#8208;sized cyclic peptides are expected to be ideal drug leads because these peptides combine the advantages, while compensating for the disadvantages, of small molecules and antibodies. Although medium&#8208;sized peptides can be produced by chemical synthesis, two major problems, namely (i) C&#945;&#8208;epimerization during C&#8208;terminal modification and (ii) side reactions in the cyclization, remain to be solved. These issues have hampered the synthesis of pure materials for bioassays, making it difficult to accomplish accurate structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) studies. Herein, we report an efficient synthesis of medium&#8208;sized cyclic peptides based on the twisted amide&#8208;mediated amidation strategy. First, a variety of linear peptides were synthesized by the &#8220;inverse&#8221; peptide synthesis and fragment coupling. Second, the C&#8208;terminus of the linear peptides were converted to twisted amides, which were then reacted with a variety of &#945;&#8208;amino acyl sulfonamides, realizing the rapid C&#8208;terminal diversification of peptides. Finally, the resulting linear peptides were cyclized by the intramolecular twisted amide&#8208;mediated amidation to afford stereochemically pure cyclic peptides. Using this strategy, total synthesis of acyl&#8208;surugamide A, the stereoselective synthesis of 13 non&#8208;natural analogs, and the discovery of potent antimicrobial/antifungal peptides beyond the natural product were also achieved.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking New Frontiers: Photo&#8208;Isomerism and Magnetic Properties in Multifunctional Hetero&#8208;Tetra&#8208;Metallic Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the synthesis, structural characterisation, and magnetic properties of hetero&#8208;tetra&#8208;metallic complexes, denoted as FeNOCuLnCo, (with Ln=Gd, Tb, or Dy). These complexes mark a significant milestone as the first examples of polyfunctional compounds containing four different metallic ions, exhibiting dual properties: reversible photo&#8208;isomerism and single&#8208;molecule magnet behaviour.







Abstract
Hetero&#8208;tetra&#8208;metallic complexes, FeNOCuLnCo (Ln=Gd, Tb, Dy), combining magnetic properties and photo&#8208;isomerism, were obtained through the rational assembly of the photo&#8208;switching nitroprusside anion FeNO with new magnetic Schiff base CuLnCo precursors. Herein, we describe the synthesis and characterisation of these compounds followed by a demonstration of their multifunctional character. Particularly noteworthy is the FeNOCuTbCo complex which is one of the few examples of a photo&#8208;isomerisable SMM.

Abstract
A highly stereoselective strategy to facilitate the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;O&#8208;linked glycosyl amino acids was established via a additive&#8208;modulated trichloroacetimidate glycosylation approach. This mild and practical protocol demonstrates broad applicability with diverse glycosyl donors, including D&#8208;gluco&#8208;, D&#8208;galacto&#8208;, 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2&#8208;azido&#8208;D&#8208;gluco&#8208;, 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2&#8208;azido&#8208;D&#8208;galacto&#8208;, D&#8208;xylo&#8208;, L&#8208;fuco&#8208;pyranosyl and L&#8208;arabinofuranosyl trichloroacetimidates, and orthogonally protected amino acids such as Ser, Thr, Tyr, and 4&#8208;hydroxyproline (Hyp) as acceptors. These 1,2&#8208;cis linked glycosyl amino acids serve as valuable building blocks for glycopeptide synthesis via solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis (SPPS), offering significant potential for advancing glycoprotein research.

         <title>A Boosting Strategy of Photovoltaics by Stacking Monolayer InSe and &#946;&#8208;Sb into Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 12, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By stacking monolayer InSe and &#946;&#8208;Sb into InSe/&#946;&#8208;Sb vdWH, enhanced photovoltaic efficiencies in visible light range and red&#8208;shift photocurrent in the infrared region can be achieved. This enhancement is attributed to the type&#8208;II band alignment for more efficient real&#8208;space carrier separation, more moderate and indirect&#8208;to&#8208;direct bad gap, higher electron/hole carrier mobility, enlarged visible light harvesting than each component.







Abstract
Identifying two&#8208;dimensional (2D) solar photovoltaic devices with high efficiency remains an urgent challenge in addressing current energy demands. Considering the limitations of isolated 2D systems in the photovoltaic applications, the most effective solution is stacking them into van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs). However, the favorable factors for photovoltaics in vdWHs are still uncertain, nor is their intrinsic enrichment or enhancement mechanism on photovoltaics being clear. Here, based on the typical monolayer transition metal&#8208;chalcogenide compound InSe and &#946;&#8208;phase antimonene (Sb), we propose a boosting strategy on photovoltaic performances by stacking them into the InSe/Sb vdWH. After confirming the feasibility of its experimental synthesis, several superior photovoltaic related characteristics are verified than its components.

     alt="A Boosting Strategy of Photovoltaics by Stacking Monolayer InSe and &#946;-Sb into Heterostructure"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By stacking monolayer InSe and &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-Sb into InSe/&lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-Sb vdWH, enhanced photovoltaic efficiencies in visible light range and red-shift photocurrent in the infrared region can be achieved. This enhancement is attributed to the type-II band alignment for more efficient real-space carrier separation, more moderate and indirect-to-direct bad gap, higher electron/hole carrier mobility, enlarged visible light harvesting than each component.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identifying two-dimensional (2D) solar photovoltaic devices with high efficiency remains an urgent challenge in addressing current energy demands. Considering the limitations of isolated 2D systems in the photovoltaic applications, the most effective solution is stacking them into van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs). However, the favorable factors for photovoltaics in vdWHs are still uncertain, nor is their intrinsic enrichment or enhancement mechanism on photovoltaics being clear. Here, based on the typical monolayer transition metal-chalcogenide compound InSe and &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-phase antimonene (Sb), we propose a boosting strategy on photovoltaic performances by stacking them into the InSe/Sb vdWH. After confirming the feasibility of its experimental synthesis, several superior photovoltaic related characteristics are verified than its components. Including the more moderately sized indirect to direct band gap, the higher electron mobilities than those of monolayer InSe, the hindrance of carrier recombination due to the staggered type-II band alignment, and the stronger and red-shifted optical harvesting abilities because of the band redistribution. In addition, further researches are conducted on the additional superior characteristics of such stacked InSe/Sb vdWH in 2D photovoltaic devices. Such as the red-shifted photocurrent into the infrared light range, the superior photoelectric conversion efficiencies in the visible light region, and the higher photovoltaic quality factors including the photon responsivity

This study introduces C&#8322;&#8208;symmetric chiral ruthenium complexes featuring &#963;&#8208;donating 1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;5&#8208;ylidene mesoionic carbene (MIC) ligands. These new class of complexes exhibit excellent catalytic activity and enantioselectivity in nitrene&#8208;mediated ring&#8208;closing C(sp3)&#8722;H amination reactions. Notably, they eliminate the need for phosphine co&#8208;catalysts and enhance electron density at the ruthenium center, offering potential advancements in ruthenium&#8208;based chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal catalysis.







Abstract
Building on our previously established chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal approach, in which the overall chirality of the transition metal catalyst is solely determined by a stereogenic metal center, we here present a new addition to the family of C2&#8208;symmetric chiral&#8208;at&#8208;ruthenium catalysts. These are C2&#8208;symmetric chiral ruthenium complexes featuring strongly &#963;&#8208;donating 1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;5&#8208;ylidene mesoionic carbene (MIC) ligands. The complexes demonstrate excellent catalytic activity and enantioselectivity in a nitrene&#8208;mediated ring&#8208;closing C(sp3)&#8722;H amination of an aliphatic azide, leading to the formation of an N&#8208;Boc&#8208;protected chiral pyrrolidine. This study highlights the potential of this new class of chiral mesoionic carbene ruthenium complexes to further enhance or modify the reactivity of ruthenium&#8208;based chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal catalysts.

         <title>Poly(1,3&#8208;Dioxolane)&#8208;Modified Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 as the Electrolyte for Enhanced Solid Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

A ploy(1,3&#8208;dioxolane) (PDOL) layer was constructed by a Al(OTf)3&#8208;induced in&#8208;situ solidification process between the interface of LATP and anode/cathode. The as&#8208;prepared PDOL as an &#8220;interfacial adhesive&#8221; can fill the gap between the LATP and the electrode, providing a better interfacial contact and reduced interfacial impedance. Such interfacial adhesive layer not only effectively prevents Li metal from reducing LATP but also provides intimate interface contact and limits unnecessary electron transport.







Abstract
Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 (LATP) as the solid&#8208;electrolyte has attracted much attention for Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, the unstable LATP/Li interface and the insufficient contact between the anode/cathode and LATP usually lead to the structural collapse of LATP and the large solid&#8211;solid interfacial resistance for Li+ transport. Herein, a poly(1,3&#8208;dioxolane) (PDOL) adhesive layer was constructed by a Al(OTf)3&#8208;induced in&#8208;situ solidification process between the interface of LATP and anode/cathode. Such PDOL interfacial adhesive layer alleviates adverse reduction reactions at the LATP/Li interface and provides stable and well&#8208;contacted bilateral electrode interfaces. Benefitting from the PDOL interfacial adhesive, the Li|adhesive&#8208;LATP|Li symmetric cells achieve a current density up to 0.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and exhibit a good cycling stability for more than 2750&#8197;h at 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and the Li|adhesive&#8208;LATP|LiFePO4 solid&#8208;state batteries with interface modification exhibit a capacity of 158&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;C with a retention of 94&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles.

The development of lanthanide and transition metal ion crosslinked gels is presented, these made from a tripodal ligand based on the benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) motif, conjugated with terminal terpyridine units through di&#8208;amide spacers. These metallogels were found to be luminescent in the case of Eu(III), Tb(III) and Zn(III), while the ions such as Fe(II) gave rise to strongly coloured material. Being healable, these gels could be cut (as shown) and spliced back together.

Several &#945;&#8208;diimine stabilized Ni(0) complexes are active precursors for in&#8197;situ catalyst formation, with particular applicability to high&#8208;throughput experimentation. These compounds are easily prepared and solution stable, and function well in several cross&#8208;coupling reactions.







Abstract
We report the synthesis, characterization, and catalytic applications of N,N&#8217;&#8208;diaryl diazabutadiene (DAB) Ni(0) complexes stabilized by alkene ligands. These complexes are soluble and stable in several organic solvents, making them ideal candidates for in&#8197;situ catalyst formation during high&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE). We used HTE to evaluate these Ni(0) precatalysts in a variety of Suzuki and C&#8722;N coupling reactions, and they were found to have equal or better performance than the still&#8208;standard Ni(0) source, Ni(COD)2.

&lt;p&gt;We report the synthesis, characterization, and catalytic applications of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&#8217;&lt;/i&gt;-diaryl diazabutadiene (DAB) Ni(0) complexes stabilized by alkene ligands. These complexes are soluble and stable in several organic solvents, making them ideal candidates for &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;situ&lt;/i&gt; catalyst formation during high-throughput experimentation (HTE). We used HTE to evaluate these Ni(0) precatalysts in a variety of Suzuki and C&#8722;N coupling reactions, and they were found to have equal or better performance than the still-standard Ni(0) source, Ni(COD)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regioselective Dimerization of Methylcyclopentadiene inside Cucurbit[7]uril</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 12, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cucurbit[7]uril serves as a supramolecular catalyst for the cycloaddition reaction of methylcyclopentadiene, affording a 104&#8208;fold rate enhancement and a significant change in the regioselectivity. This reaction predominantly yields a single product that is both kinetically and thermodynamically disfavored and typically observed only as a minor component in the dimerization of neat methylcyclopentadiene or in commercial dimeric mixtures.







Abstract
The molecular confinement within rigid macrocyclic receptors can trigger catalytic activity and steer the selectivity of organic reactions. In this work, the dimerization of methylcyclopentadiene (MCPD) isomers in the presence of cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) was found to display, besides a large rate acceleration, a striking regioselectivity in aqueous solution at pH&#8197;3, different from the products predominating in the absence of the supramolecular catalyst. Among the different possible regioisomers and diastereomers, the endo&#8208;3,7&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;3a,4,7,7a&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;4,7&#8208;methanoindene adduct was selectively formed, which is otherwise found only as a minor product in the dimerization of neat MCPD or in commercial dimeric mixtures. This product originates from the reaction of the heteroternary complex of 1&#8208;MCPD and 2&#8208;MCPD within CB7, in which the methyl groups are positioned in an &#8220;anti&#8208;diaxial&#8221; arrangement and point towards the open portals of the macrocycle, resulting in a preferred packing of the reacting cyclopentadiene rings. The selectivity of the dimerization of MCPD in the absence and presence of CB7 is supported by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations.

         <title>Catalytic Serine Labeling in Nonaqueous, Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 12, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Serine&#8208;targeting protein bioconjugation has been a formidable challenge because of the modest reactivity of the alkyl alcohol group in aqueous media. This work demonstrates a biomolecule&#8208;compatible, nonaqueous approach to achieve alkyl alcohol&#8208;selective labeling through acid&#8208;catalyzed esterification reactions, which offers a unique advantage over the existing serine protease&#8208;targeting method using a fluorophosphonate reagent.







Abstract
Chemoselective modification of alkyl alcohols (e.&#8201;g., serine residues) on proteins has been a daunting challenge especially in aqueous media. Herein, we report chemical modification of alkyl alcohols in protein and cell lysate samples using carboxylic acid&#8208;based bioconjugation media. The acidic medium is not only useful to suppress reactivity of other nucleophiles in proteins, but the medium also serves as a potentially biomolecule&#8208;compatible solvent. The acid&#8208;catalyzed acylation strategy has a unique selectivity paradigm compared to the common active&#8208;serine&#8208;targeted method and would act as a new strategy for studying biological roles of serine residues.

         <title>A Hybrid BN&#8208;Doped Nanographene with Narrow Emission Bandwidths for OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 12, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Computational screening, synthesis and characterization identified BN&#8208;containing candidate 1 as a promising narrow bandwidth chromophore. BN doped nanographene exhibits blue fluorescence at 441&#8197;nm with an extraordinarily narrow fluorescence peak with full width at half maximum (FWHM)=10&#8211;11&#8197;nm that outperforms narrow bandwidths of the incumbent references. Utility of the compound for long lifetime narrow bandwidth OLEDs has also been demonstrated







Abstract
We describe synthesis of BN&#8208;doped nanographene containing five phenylene units, boron and nitrogen atoms with alternating ortho&#8208;disposition, as well as direct B&#8722;N connections. Resulting BN doped nanographene exhibits blue fluorescence at 441&#8197;nm with an extraordinarily narrow fluorescence peak with a full width at half maximum (FWHM)=10&#8211;11&#8197;nm. Crystallography reveals supramolecular organization of this compound in the crystal phase. Initial organic light emitting device (OLED) data suggest that the presence of a directly connected B&#8722;N isostere can lead to devices with sufficiently long lifetime as well as narrow emission electro&#8208;luminescence peaks necessary for OLED applications.

         <title>DNA Origami Adsorption and Lattice Formation on Different SiOx Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 12, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface&#8208;assisted assembly of DNA origami lattices on silicon oxide surfaces is of great importance for molecular lithography. Here, it is shown that the type of the silicon oxide employed has a tremendous impact on DNA origami adsorption and lattice assembly, with efficient lattice formation requiring low surface roughness and high oxide density.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled DNA origami lattices on silicon oxide surfaces have great potential to serve as masks in molecular lithography. However, silicon oxide surfaces come in many different forms and the type and history of the silicon oxide has a large effect on its physicochemical surface properties. Therefore, we here investigate DNA origami lattice formation on differently fabricated SiOx films on silicon wafers after wet&#8208;chemical oxidation by RCA1. Despite having similar oxide compositions and hydroxylation states, of all surfaces tested, only thermally grown SiOx performs similarly well as native oxide. For the other SiOx films deposited by plasma&#8208;enhanced chemical vapor deposition and magnetron sputtering, DNA origami adsorption is strongly suppressed. This is attributed to an increased surface roughness and a lower oxide density, respectively. Our results demonstrate that the employed SiOx surface may decide over the outcome of an experiment and should be considered as an additional parameter that may require optimization and fine&#8208;tuning before high&#8208;quality lattices can be assembled. In particular, our observations suggest that efficient DNA origami lattice assembly on SiOx surfaces requires a low surface roughness and a high oxide density.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Thioglycosylated Monolignol Dual Probes for Bioimaging of Lignin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 12, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the design, synthesis, and application of thioglycosylated monolignol probes, functionalized for bioorthogonal labeling, to study lignin biosynthesis in plant cell walls. By incorporating stable sulfur&#8208;linked glycosides with clickable tags, we enable precise in&#8197;situ visualization of lignin through confocal fluorescence microscopy. Our results highlight unique insights into the spatial dynamics and roles of monolignol glucosides in lignification.







Abstract
Lignin biosynthesis is a critical process that underpins plant structural integrity and defenses. Central to this pathway are monolignol glucosides (MLGs), whose role as intermediates remains debated. To elucidate MLGs&#8217; involvement, we developed thioglycosylated monolignol probes compatible with click chemistry for in&#8197;situ visualization of lignin biosynthesis. Using a highly selective Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig&#8211;Migita cross&#8208;coupling approach, these probes incorporate glycosyl thiols into MLGs, creating stable thioacetal bonds to enhance both metabolic stability and tracking precision. The unique chemistry of these probes allows for incorporation within the lignification pathway, enabling specific visualization of MLG involvement in lignin formation. The probes are compatible with bioorthogonal chemistry labeling and confocal microscopy, allowing detailed tracking of MLG transport, storage, and incorporation into cell walls. Our findings provide new insights into lignification dynamics, underscoring the metabolic roles of MLGs and demonstrating their potential as metabolic intermediates in lignin polymerization. This approach offers a novel chemical biology toolset to dissect plant cell wall biosynthesis and will help elucidatethe molecular roles of MLGs in the context of plant biochemistry and resilience.

     alt="Design and Synthesis of Thioglycosylated Monolignol Dual Probes for Bioimaging of Lignin Biosynthesis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present the design, synthesis, and application of thioglycosylated monolignol probes, functionalized for bioorthogonal labeling, to study lignin biosynthesis in plant cell walls. By incorporating stable sulfur-linked glycosides with clickable tags, we enable precise in&#8197;situ visualization of lignin through confocal fluorescence microscopy. Our results highlight unique insights into the spatial dynamics and roles of monolignol glucosides in lignification.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lignin biosynthesis is a critical process that underpins plant structural integrity and defenses. Central to this pathway are monolignol glucosides (MLGs), whose role as intermediates remains debated. To elucidate MLGs&#8217; involvement, we developed thioglycosylated monolignol probes compatible with click chemistry for in&#8197;situ visualization of lignin biosynthesis. Using a highly selective Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig&#8211;Migita cross-coupling approach, these probes incorporate glycosyl thiols into MLGs, creating stable thioacetal bonds to enhance both metabolic stability and tracking precision. The unique chemistry of these probes allows for incorporation within the lignification pathway, enabling specific visualization of MLG involvement in lignin formation. The probes are compatible with bioorthogonal chemistry labeling and confocal microscopy, allowing detailed tracking of MLG transport, storage, and incorporation into cell walls. Our findings provide new insights into lignification dynamics, underscoring the metabolic roles of MLGs and demonstrating their potential as metabolic intermediates in lignin polymerization. This approach offers a novel chemical biology toolset to dissect plant cell wall biosynthesis and will help elucidatethe molecular roles of MLGs in the context of plant biochemistry and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Global and Local Shielding/Deshielding Variation in C60 and C70 Fullerenes Upon Reduction: Evaluation of Aromaticity, 13C&#8208;NMR and Anisotropy Patterns</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 12, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The six&#8208;fold reduction of C60 and C70 fullerenes modifies the magnetic response of the &#960; electrons enabling global and local variations of shielding/deshielding regions along different orientations of the external field which are represented in the variations of 13C&#8208;NMR shifts given by the &#963;33 shielding component under the principal axis system (PAS) of the chemical shift anisotropy.







Abstract
Fullerenes are statically pleasant species featuring symmetric cages, which can be modified upon reduction. Here, we theoretically account for the variation of 13C&#8208;NMR patterns in C60 and C70 upon six&#8208;fold reduction and the overall variation of the enabled shielding/deshielding regions induced by &#960; and &#963; electrons according to different orientations of the external field and the related anisotropy. Our results show a significant modification of the chemical shift given by the main variation of the &#963;33 (or &#948;33) shielding component under the principal axis system (PAS) of the chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) at the representative carbon nucleus. For C606&#8722; a shielding cone property is enabled from any orientation, accounting for a significant spherical aromatic character. In contrast, in C706&#8722;, a shielding cone is reserved only for an axial&#8208;oriented field, with a deshielding cone behavior obtained from the complementary equatorial orientations. The overall anisotropy shows an inner isotropic region for C60 and C606&#8722;, with a continuous anisotropic outer contour for the latter. In contrast, C70 and C706&#8722; both show larger anisotropies, given the lesser spherical shape in addition to the modified &#960;&#8208;surface. Such information is useful for further rationalizing the implementation of magnetic anisotropic molecular devices into fullerene&#8208;based materials.

         <title>Controlled Self&#8208;assembly of Nanographdiynes Mediated by Molecular Dipoles Induced by Rotatory Asymmetric Substituents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 12, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rotatory bulky asymmetry substituents were introduced at the edge of nanographdiynes to induce molecular dipole. And directional dipole&#8208;dipole interactions guided these nanographdiynes, which were substituted by groups with different push&#8208;pull electronic properties, to self&#8208;assemble into different &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacked H&#8208;dimers. These dimers exhibited different conformations, different abilities to further aggregation, and ultimately had different optical properties.







Abstract
The discrete &#960;&#8208; stacks of specific lengths and orientation is crucial for understanding the impact of intermolecular interactions on optical or electronic properties of nanographdiynes. We designed and synthesized nanographdiynes modified with bulky rotatable asymmetric substituents. The peripheral substituents with different push&#8208;pull electronic properties can induce molecular dipoles perpendicular to nanoGDY &#960; surface with different orientation. Mediated by directional dipole&#8208;dipole interactions, o&#8208;TBGDY substituted with electron&#8208;donating tert&#8208;butylphenyl groups cofacially dimerized with a twist angle, involving intermolecular interlocking of ortho&#8208;substituted tert&#8208;butylphenyl groups. In contrast, OTFGDY substituted with electron&#8208;withdrawing trifluorophenyl groups formed dimeric H&#8208;aggregates with an in&#8208;plane shift along one diyne linkage, in which the ortho&#8208;substituted trifluorophenyl groups point toward the outside of the interacting &#960;&#8208;plane. o&#8208;TBGDY can only exist as isolated H&#8208;dimer in the solid state, while OTFGDY can form a hybrid tetramer of H&#8208; and J&#8208;aggregates. Our researches reveal a new method for preparing discrete &#960;&#8208;stacked dye assemblies with well&#8208;defined optoelectronic properties.

A new miniaturized framework for graphitic material featuring three neighboring pyridinic nitrogen atoms is disclosed. The quinoline/quinazoline hybridized pseudo trimeric macrocycle, DiQuinoline(Q)&#8208;MonoQuinazolines(Qz), Q2Qz1, was readily synthesized from the key macrocyclic amide precursor in a modular fashion. Its central cavity strongly captures a proton, and the thus&#8208;formed positively charged, highly planar architecture exhibits supramolecular complexation through &#960;&#8208;interactions. Q2Qz1, with its unique properties, was applied as a scavenger for toxic polyaromatic hydrocarbons and as a G&#8208;quartet ligand for potential therapeutic agent for cancer chemotherapy.

         <dc:description>
The impact of single&#8208;atom substitution on the resistive switching memory behaviour of D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A architectured phenanthroimidazole &#8208;based small organic molecules has been investigated. The compounds exhibited excellent organic resistive performance with a low threshold voltage, a high ON/OFF current ratio, and a long retention time.







Abstract
A series of D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A compounds, with fluorene and its heteroanalogs (carbazole, dibenzofuran, dibenzothiophene) as the donor units and phenanthroimidazole as the acceptor, were designed and synthesized for non&#8208;volatile memory device applications. The effect of single&#8208;atom substitution on memory behavior was examined through optical, electrochemical, and computational studies. The photophysical studies confirm a significant intramolecular charge transfer from the donor to the acceptor unit, and the electrochemical analysis shows an irreversible anodic peak (0.99&#8211;1.21&#8197;V) with an optimal band gap ranging from 2.80 to 2.88&#8197;eV. All the compounds exhibited non&#8208;volatile binary WORM memory behaviour with an ON/OFF current ratio of 105 and 103. The devices also showed excellent stability over 100 cycles and maintained a retention time of 4000&#8197;s. Notably, the compound with carbazole substitution displayed a lower threshold voltage and a higher ON/OFF current ratio of 105. Density functional theory calculations confirmed that the combined effects of charge transfer and charge trapping mechanisms are crucial to the resistive switching mechanisms observed. This work highlights the potential of single atom substitution in D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A systems, providing valuable insights for designing high&#8208;performance data storage devices.

The photophysical studies confirm a significant intramolecular charge transfer from the donor to the acceptor unit, and the electrochemical analysis shows an irreversible anodic peak (0.99&#8211;1.21&#8197;V) with an optimal band gap ranging from 2.80 to 2.88&#8197;eV. All the compounds exhibited non-volatile binary WORM memory behaviour with an ON/OFF current ratio of 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The devices also showed excellent stability over 100 cycles and maintained a retention time of 4000&#8197;s. Notably, the compound with carbazole substitution displayed a lower threshold voltage and a higher ON/OFF current ratio of 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;. Density functional theory calculations confirmed that the combined effects of charge transfer and charge trapping mechanisms are crucial to the resistive switching mechanisms observed. This work highlights the potential of single atom substitution in D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A systems, providing valuable insights for designing high-performance data storage devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The unique umpolung of the nitromethyl group is exploited for solvent&#8208;selective nucleophilic sulfur and amine addition.

The unprecedent gold&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of nitriles with o&#8208;iodophenols or o&#8208;iodoanilines via Au(I)/Au(III) redox catalysis has been developed, leading to benzoxazoles or benzimidazoles with broad substrate scope. Mechanistic investigation reveals that the Au(III)&#8208;Ar species generated via oxidative addition of o&#8208;iodophenol to MeDalphosAu+, serves as a key intermediate.

Abstract
The unprecedent gold&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of nitriles with o&#8208;iodophenols or o&#8208;iodoanilines via Au(I)/Au(III) redox catalysis has been developed, providing an expedient route to the synthesis of benzoxazoles or benzimidazoles with broad substrate scope and high functional compatibility. Mechanistic investigation reveals that the Au(III)&#8208;Ar species generated via oxidative addition of o&#8208;iodophenol to MeDalphosAu+, serves as a key intermediate. Particularly, this annulation is initiated by oxidative addition, rather than the nucleophilic attack of the phenol moiety in o&#8208;iodophenol towards the nitrile. The method was also applied to the synthesis of poly aza&#8208;heterocycles via a cascade Au(I)/Au(III) and Au(I) catalysis relay.

Lead&#8208;based piezoceramics are the dominant materials used in electronic devices, despite the known toxicity of lead. Developing safer piezoelectric materials has inspired the pursuit of lead&#8208;free piezoceramics, however some challenges remain in accessing these materials reproducibly. This study demonstrates a simple and robust method for synthesis of the lead&#8208;free piezoceramic material, potassium sodium niobate (KxNa1&#8208;xNbO3, KNN) via an aqueous route.







Abstract
Lead&#8208;based piezoceramics are the dominant materials used in electronic devices, despite the known toxicity of lead. Developing safer piezoelectric materials has inspired the pursuit of lead&#8208;free piezoceramics, however some challenges remain in accessing these materials reproducibly. Here we demonstrate a simple and robust method for synthesis of the lead&#8208;free piezoceramic material, potassium sodium niobate (KxNa1&#8208;xNbO3, KNN) via an aqueous route. Stochiometric KNN (K0.5Na0.5NbO3) was prepared, by combining alkali&#8208;nitrate salts (NaNO3 and KNO3) with the hexaniobate ([HxNb6O19]8&#8722;x, Nb6) species in water, followed by heating at elevated temperatures for at least one hour. Ex situ heating of the amorphous alkali&#8208;Nb6 precursor reveals stoichiometric control and phase uniformity are possible in making KNN, versus a solid&#8208;state route. In situ heating in a transmission electron microscope (TEM), with selected area electron diffraction (SAED), facilitates monitoring the real&#8208;time transformation of the amorphous alkali&#8208;Nb6 precursor, to yield monoclinic KNN, in agreement with ex situ results. Therefore, an aqueous route via hexaniobate is an attractive alternative approach for developing lead&#8208;free piezoceramic materials.

Photochemistry: A cheap, metal&#8208;free, photochemical protocol for the 1,4&#8208;decarboxylative addition between carboxylic acids and electron&#8208;deficient olefins, under irradiation at 427&#8197;nm, utilizing the cheap, metal&#8208;free, commercially available, thioxanthone or thioxanthone&#8208;TfOH complex as the suitable photocatalyst. A broad substrate scope, bearing a variety of functional groups is introduced producing the desired products in high yields.







Abstract
Synthetic photochemistry is an alternative, green and sustainable approach in organic synthesis, offering the possibility for the discovery of novel reactivities. Carboxylic acids are abundant and widely used as suitable radical precursors for light&#8208;mediated processes, providing access to products that are not accessible via conventional methods. Herein, we report a green, cheap, metal&#8208;free, photochemical decarboxylative protocol for the 1,4&#8208;radical conjugate addition (Giese reaction) using thioxanthone, a commercially available organic molecule, or a thioxanthone&#8208;triflic acid (TfOH) complex, as the photocatalyst, under LED 427&#8197;nm irradiation. A wide range of carboxylic acids, amino acids and Michael acceptors has been tested, affording the desired products in good to high yields.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric De Novo Synthesis of Chiral Pyrroles Through Desymmetrizing Oxidative [3+2]&#8208;Cycloaddition and the Van Leusen Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 12, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This report delineates the first catalytic enantioselective de novo construction of centrally chiral pyrroles through desymmetrizing oxidative [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition and the first catalytic asymmetric Van Leusen reaction with &#945;&#8211;substituted TosMIC for the synthesis of unsymmetrical pyrroles. A wide range of polycyclic 2&#8208;substituted, 3,4&#8208;fused pyrroles were obtained in high yields and with good to high enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Central chirality in heteroarene derivatives arising from unsymmetrically substituted heteroarene rings is an intriguing but underexplored topic. Herein, we reported the first catalytic enantioselective de novo construction of centrally chiral pyrroles through desymmetrizing oxidative [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition by employing silver catalysis. This judicious desymmetrization can produce at least four continuous stereogenic centers without creating any additional stereocenter. Furthermore, to introduce a more diverse set of substituents, we developed the first catalytic asymmetric Van Leusen reaction with &#945;&#8211;substituted TosMIC for the synthesis of centrally chiral pyrroles. A wide range of polycyclic 2&#8208;substituted, 3,4&#8208;fused pyrroles were obtained in high yields and with good to high enantioselectivities. This report includes the elaboration of methanobenzo[f]isoindole to synthetically challenging building block chiral isoindole compounds, which are synthesized enantioselectively for the first time.

         <title>Development of pH&#8208;Responsive SA/PEGDA/AS&#8208;POSS Hydrogels via Michael Addition for Controlled Drug Release and Enhanced Mechanical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 12, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops pH&#8208;responsive SA/PEGDA/AS&#8208;POSS hydrogels through Michael addition reactions to achieve controlled drug release and enhanced mechanical properties. The hydrogels exhibit tunable swelling and degradation behaviors under various pH conditions, demonstrating their potential for targeted drug delivery. These hydrogels offer promising prospects for biomedical applications, providing efficient drug loading, controlled release, and improved mechanical strength.







Abstract
In this study, thiolated sodium alginate (SA) and hydrophilic, polymerizable Janus&#8208;type polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (AS&#8208;POSS) are synthesized by introducing thiol and sulfonic acid groups, respectively. A series of pH&#8208;responsive SA/PEGDA/AS&#8208;POSS nanocomposite hydrogels are successfully prepared through Michael addition reactions between the thiol groups of thiolated sodium alginate and the double bonds in the molecular chains of AS&#8208;POSS and poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA). This reaction proceeds rapidly under physiological conditions without requiring initiators or catalysts. As the content of AS&#8208;POSS increases, the pore size within the hydrogel decreases, and the network structure becomes denser, with significant improvements in mechanical properties. The hydrogel exhibits excellent pH sensitivity, showing lower swelling in acidic media compared to neutral media, and undergoing hydrolysis and losing stability in alkaline media. Moreover, the incorporation of AS&#8208;POSS significantly enhances the drug&#8208;loading capacity (85.7&#8201;%) and encapsulation efficiency (72.1&#8201;%) of doxorubicin (DOX). The drug is released faster in weakly acidic environments, with a cumulative release rate reaching 80.4&#8201;%, demonstrating excellent targeting and controlled release properties. Cytotoxicity tests show that the SA/PEGDA/AS&#8208;POSS hydrogel has good biocompatibility and exhibits effective tumor&#8208;killing ability, indicating its great potential as a drug carrier with promising applications in biomedical materials.

         <title>Development of Off&#8208;On Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescent Probes for Sensitive In Vivo Imaging of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Species with Enhanced Pharmacokinetics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 12, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a novel A&#946; species&#8208;sensing NIR fluorescent probes NIR&#8208;1 with enhanced in&#8197;vivo pharmacokinetics and low non&#8208;specific interaction due to the introduction of water&#8208;soluble and biocompatible morpholine and PEG chain. NIR&#8208;1 was further demonstrated to be an effective fluorescent tool for the specific detection of soluble and insoluble A&#946; species in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
The fluorescent imaging of pathologically accumulated &#946;&#8208;amyloid (A&#946;) proteins is of significant importance to the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the paper, we prepare two new NIR probes, NIR&#8208;1 and NIR&#8208;2, through hydrophilic modification of introducing water&#8208;soluble bioactive groups such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) and morpholine to tune in&#8197;vivo pharmacokinetics for specific detection of soluble and insoluble A&#946; species. The in&#8197;vitro assessments confirm that both NIR&#8208;1 and NIR&#8208;2 display strong near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence (FL) enhancement upon interaction with A&#946;42 monomers, oligomers or aggregates (&#955;em&gt;670&#8197;nm) and show highly sensitive, rapid and selective response towards A&#946;42 species. After i.&#8201;v. injection, each probe showed fast blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) penetration and immediately produced intense FL signals in the brain of APP/PS1 AD model mice at 10&#8197;min. Moreover, compared with NIR&#8208;2, NIR&#8208;1 bearing a hydrophilic PEG chain displayed not only more rapid clearance but also lower background signal to efficiently distinguish APP/PS1 mice and wild&#8208;type mice with higher signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio, which was further validated by ex vivo histological staining of brain tissues. Therefore, due to its excellent pharmacokinetics, NIR&#8208;1 shows great promise as an effective NIR probe for specific detection of A&#946; species.

         <title>Tolane&#8208;Based Phosphino&#8208; and Arsino&#8208;Ruthenium Complexes in Three Different Oxidation States: Ru(I), Ru(II) and Ru(III)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 12, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ruthenium(II) complexes featuring iPr2P&#8208; and iPr2As&#8208;functionalized diphenylacetylene scaffolds were examined with respect to 1e&#8722; reduction and oxidation. An octahedral ruthenium(III) complexes was obtained for the iPr2As&#8208;functionalized ligand and a square&#8208;planar ruthenium(I) complex was isolated for the phospha&#8208;derivative. The latter ruthenium(I) complex was found to react with TlPF6 to produce a trinuclear species containing a nearly linear Ru&#8722;Tl&#8722;Ru moiety.







Abstract
Targeting Ru(III) and Ru(I) &#951;2&#8208;alkyne species, 2,2&#8217;&#8208;(iPr2E)2&#8208;substituted diphenylacetylenes (1&#8208;E, E=P, As) were employed for the preparation of [ECCE]&#8208;coordinated ruthenium complexes. The reactions between 1&#8208;E and cis&#8208;(MeCN)2(COD)RuCl2 led to the required Ru(II) starting materials cis&#8208;[ECCE]RuCl2(MeCN) (3&#8208;E). Upon oxidation of 3&#8208;E with PhICl2, the Ru(III) target complexes [ECCE]RuCl3 (7&#8208;E) were detectable for E=P and E=As, but only the arsa&#8208;derivative 7&#8208;As was obtained in a pure form, namely via oxidation of cis&#8208;[AsCCAs]RuCl2(THT) (THT=tetrahydrothiophene). Upon reduction of compounds 3&#8208;E, a hitherto unprecedented Ru(I) &#951;2&#8208;alkyne complex, [PCCP]RuCl (9), was obtained for E=P. The former square planar Ru(I) complex (9) was characterized comprehensively and examined in detail by means of DFT and CASSCF calculation. Upon treatment of 9 with TlPF6, a diamagnetic &#956;&#8208;Tl&#8208;bridged compound (10) with a nearly linear Ru&#8722;Tl&#8722;Ru array was formed and isolated in high yields. Careful analysis of the bonding situation suggested that the Ru&#8722;Tl&#8722;Ru moiety in 10 is best interpreted in terms of a 3c&#8211;4e&#8722; bond.

The reactions between &lt;b&gt;1-E&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-(MeCN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(COD)RuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; led to the required Ru(II) starting materials &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-[ECCE]RuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(MeCN) (&lt;b&gt;3-E&lt;/b&gt;). Upon oxidation of &lt;b&gt;3-E&lt;/b&gt; with PhICl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the Ru(III) target complexes [ECCE]RuCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;7-E&lt;/b&gt;) were detectable for E=P and E=As, but only the &lt;i&gt;arsa&lt;/i&gt;-derivative &lt;b&gt;7-As&lt;/b&gt; was obtained in a pure form, namely via oxidation of &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-[AsCCAs]RuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(THT) (THT=tetrahydrothiophene). Upon reduction of compounds &lt;b&gt;3-E&lt;/b&gt;, a hitherto unprecedented Ru(I) &lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-alkyne complex, [PCCP]RuCl (&lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt;), was obtained for E=P. The former square planar Ru(I) complex (&lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt;) was characterized comprehensively and examined in detail by means of DFT and CASSCF calculation. Upon treatment of &lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt; with TlPF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, a diamagnetic &lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;-Tl-bridged compound (&lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt;) with a nearly linear Ru&#8722;Tl&#8722;Ru array was formed and isolated in high yields. Careful analysis of the bonding situation suggested that the Ru&#8722;Tl&#8722;Ru moiety in &lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt; is best interpreted in terms of a 3&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;4&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; bond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;Dependent Amide or Thioamide Formation of Acylsilanes with Amines using Elemental Sulfur</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 12, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
From the same starting materials, light versus thermal conditions have been found to activate elemental sulfur to generate alternate sets of either amides or thioamides, respectively. The umpolung of reactivity of the acylsilanes was confirmed mechanistically and the complimentary ligation methods tolerate highly functionalized chemical environments, even in the generation and crosslinking of co&#8208;polymers.







Abstract
Due to the diverse chemical and physical properties of functional groups, mild and controllable ligation methods are often required to construct complex drugs and functional materials. To make diverse sets of products with tunable physicochemical properties, it is also useful to employ complimentary ligation methods that adopt the same starting materials. Here, we disclose the efficient and modular synthesis of amides or thioamides through the chemical ligation of acylsilanes with amines, simply by turning a light on or off. This method is fast, mild, high&#8208;yielding and displays excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance. The versatility of these reactions is highlighted by their ability to perform post&#8208;synthetic modifications on a variety of marketed medications, peptides, natural substances, and compounds with biological activity. In&#8208;depth computational and experimental studies clarified the photo&#8208;dependent umpolung of reactivity of acylsilanes, namely: photoexcitation leads to nucleophilic O&#8208;silyl carbenes that react with S8 to form O&#8208;silyl thionoesters and eventually amides. In contrast, acylsilanes react as electrophiles with amines thermally in the dark, with C&#8594;O silyl transfer, prior to reacting with S8 to form thioamides. These mechanistic details are expected to guide the development of similar coupling reactions.

         <title>Fluorinated Macrocycle for Adsorptive Separation and Chromatographic Separation of Toluene and Methylcyclohexane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 12, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving both chromatographic separation and adsorptive separation using a single material is a highly desirable goal. Herein, this study describes a fluorinated macrocycle 4FTP3 to realize the adsorptive separation of toluene from a toluene/methylcyclohexane mixture with a purity of 99.3&#8201;% in a single adsorption cycle. Additionally, the use of 4FTP3 as a gas chromatographic stationary phase permitted the high&#8208;resolution separation of a toluene/methylcyclohexane mixture.







Abstract
Achieving the adsorptive separation and chromatographic separation of industrially the important chemicals toluene and methylcyclohexane using the same material is a highly desirable goal. We have successfully accomplished this using a fluorinated macrocycle tetrafluoroterphen[3]arene (4FTP3), which was synthesized and used for gas chromatographic separation in our previous work. The macrocycle 4FTP3 permitted the adsorptive separation of toluene from a toluene/methylcyclohexane mixture (1&#8201;:&#8201;1, v/v) with a purity of 99.3&#8201;% in a single adsorption cycle. Additionally, the use of 4FTP3 as a gas chromatographic stationary phase permitted the high&#8208;resolution separation of a toluene/methylcyclohexane mixture, with a retention capacity decreasing in the order of: toluene&gt;methylcyclohexane. Single&#8208;crystal structural analysis revealed that the C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F interactions between 4FTP3 and toluene resulted in an enhanced binding affinity, association enthalpy, and longer retention time for toluene. This macrocycle is of particular interest for use as a separation material due to its simultaneous adsorptive separation and gas chromatographic separation of toluene/methylcyclohexane. The present fluorinated macrocycle may therefore have roles to play in both analytical science and the chemical industry.

         <title>Upgrade of Weak &#963;&#8208;Hole Bond Donors via Cr(CO)3 Complexation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 12, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystallographic studies and theoretical calculation prove that the &#951;6&#8208;coordination of the neutral Cr(CO)3 moiety by arenes is a general approach for activating the &#963;&#8208;hole donor ability of heteroatoms appended to the arene.







Abstract
Molecular recognition mediated by &#963;&#8208;hole interactions is enhanced as the electrostatic potential at the &#963;&#8208;hole becomes increasingly positive. Traditional methods to strengthen &#963;&#8208;hole donor ability of atoms such as halogens often involve covalent modifications, such as, introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents (neutral or positively charged) or electrochemical oxidation. Metal coordination, a relatively underexplored approach, offers a promising alternative. In this study, &#951;6&#8208;coordination of Cr(CO)3 to haloarenes, a neutral system, is demonstrated to significantly increase the electrophilic character of halogen bond donors, enabling weak donors such as chloroanisole to form short and directional Cl&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O halogen bonds. Structural characterization using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and computational analysis of a series of &#951;6&#8208;Cr(CO)3&#8208;coordinated haloarenes provides evidence for this enhancement. Furthermore, the effect is shown to extend to other heteroatomic substituents on the coordinated arene, e.&#8201;g., other halogen atoms as well as elements of groups 16, 15, and 14 of the periodic table, broadening the scope of this approach.

         <title>Selenium Nucleophilicity and Electrophilicity in the Intra&#8208; and Intermolecular SN2 Reactions of Selenenyl Sulfide Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 12, February 25, 2025. </description>

Chalcogenol&#8208;dichalcogenide exchange reactions of linear and cyclic dichalcogenides are investigated in silico to gain insight into their relative rates. The unveiled role of double exchange reactions in the chemistry of RX1, a selenenyl sulfide TrxR1 probe, explains the origin of its specificity even under high&#8208;thiol concentrations and provides hints to design new selective TrxR1 probes.







Abstract
Chalcogenide exchange reactions are an important class of bimolecular nucleophilic substitution reactions (SN2) involving sulfur and selenium species as nucleophile, central atom, and/or leaving group, which are fundamental throughout redox biology and metabolism. While thiol&#8208;disulfide exchange reactions have been deeply investigated, those involving selenium are less understood, especially with regards to the polarised selenenyl sulfides RSe&#8211;SR&#8217;. This functional group, which is fundamental in the biochemistry of glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin reductase enzymes, was recently incorporated in the molecular scaffold of a TrxR1 specific probe, &#8220;RX1&#8221;. Here, we investigate the SN2@S and SN2@Se reactions of selenenyl sulfides in silico to provide the first comprehensive overview of their kinetic and thermodynamic trends, referencing against symmetrical disulfides and diselenides. Then, the role of SN2@S and SN2@Se reactions in RX1 chemistry is explored, and a mechanistic picture of its biological chemistry is provided. Additionally, we quantify the role of alternative exchange reactions in the double&#8208;exchange chemistry of RX1. This analysis rationalises the origins of RX1&#8217;s TrxR&#8208;specificity even within thiol&#8208;rich cellular environments and can support the design and applications of a range of selenenyl sulfide&#8208;based bioactive probes. Particularly, we observe that the intramolecular SN2@Se reaction which restores RX1 ground state is an effective protective mechanism against unspecific activation by thiols, explaining its capacity to work in high&#8208;thiol concentration.

Here, we investigate the S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2@S and S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2@Se reactions of selenenyl sulfides &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; to provide the first comprehensive overview of their kinetic and thermodynamic trends, referencing against symmetrical disulfides and diselenides. Then, the role of S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2@S and S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2@Se reactions in RX1 chemistry is explored, and a mechanistic picture of its biological chemistry is provided. Additionally, we quantify the role of alternative exchange reactions in the double-exchange chemistry of RX1. This analysis rationalises the origins of RX1&#8217;s TrxR-specificity even within thiol-rich cellular environments and can support the design and applications of a range of selenenyl sulfide-based bioactive probes. Particularly, we observe that the intramolecular S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2@Se reaction which restores RX1 ground state is an effective protective mechanism against unspecific activation by thiols, explaining its capacity to work in high-thiol concentration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chlorination&#8208;Supported Shrinkage of C60 Fullerene to Non&#8208;classical C58 Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 12, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dedicated to the memory of Prof. S. I. Troyanov.Carbon cage shrinkage of C60 to C58 was achieved via high&#8208;temperature chlorination with SbCl5/SbCl3 mixture. Two HPLC isolated and structurally characterized compounds, C58(NC1)Cl20 and C58(NC1)Cl24, contain one heptagon, two fused pentagon pairs, one pentagon triple, and one pentagon quartet in their non&#8208;classical carbon cages. Pathways of chlorination promoted skeletal cage transformations via C2 loss and Stone&#8208;Wales rearrangements are discussed in detail.







Abstract
We provide important novel insights into skeletal transformations of fullerene by reporting new cases of cage shrinkage in the most abundant C60 fullerene via a C2 loss. High&#8208;temperature (400&#8211;500&#8201;&#176;C) chlorination of IPR C60 with SbCl5 or SbCl5/SbCl3 mixtures predominantly gives non&#8208;IPR C60Cln compounds via Stone&#8208;Wales rearrangements, but the present study further reveals non&#8208;classical C58Cln chlorofullerenes as by&#8208;products. The new C58(NC1)Cl20 and C58(NC1)Cl24 chlorides have been isolated by air&#8208;free HPLC and structurally characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Their non&#8208;classical carbon cages feature one heptagon, two pairs of fused pentagons, one triple&#8208;pentagon junction, and one quartet of sequentially fused pentagons. However, the chlorination patterns and molecular shapes of C58(NC1)Cl20 and C58(NC1)Cl24 are essentially different. We propose the likely multistep transformation pathways toward the new compounds and further report the chlorination&#8208;promoted formation of chlorofullerenes with still smaller fullerene cages.

         <title>Three Dimensional CNTs Interweaved Layered MnTe Nanoparticles as a New Cathode For Aqueous Zinc Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 12, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;step ball milling method is applied to enhance the conductivity of commercial MnTe cathode by constructing three dimensional (3D) CNTs&#8208;interweaved MnTe nanoparticles, which can achieve ultrafast ion conduction. The stable cycling benefits from the synergistic effects between layered MnTe and 3D CNTs, which can improve the electrons/ions diffusion kinetics for AZIB.







Abstract
Currently, the development of suitable transition metal chalcogenides (TMDs) for aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) is plagued by the terrible conductivity and electrochemical properties. Herein, a one&#8208;step ball milling method is applied to enhance the conductivity of commercial MnTe cathode by constructing three dimensional (3D) carbon nanotubes (CNTs) interweaved MnTe nanoparticles (abbreviated as MnTe@CNTs), which can achieve ultrafast ion conduction. The stable electrochemistry properties benefit from the synergistic effects between layered MnTe and 3D CNTs, which can improve the electrons/ions diffusion kinetics as cycling. So MnTe@CNTs achieves a ultra&#8208;high capacity of 427.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and superior capacity retention of 97.6&#8201;% at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 over 200 cycles. Zinc&#8208;storage mechanisms can be revealed with the aid of operando XRD and ex situ XPS spectra. MnTe as a new cathode presents superior Zn&#8208;storage ability for high&#8208;performance AZIBs.

         <title>Piezochromic Luminescence of Pyrene Derivatives Polymorphism Around Excimer Forming Process</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 12, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Luminescent behavior and structural evolution of a polymorphous system comprising a blue&#8208;emitting phase (IMPY&#8208;B) and a green&#8208;emitting phase (IMPY&#8208;G), both featuring dimeric pyrene stacking, were investigated under high&#8208;pressure conditions. IMPY&#8208;B, characterized by weaker intermolecular interactions within a dimer, exhibits a larger red&#8208;shift in its PL spectra and requires higher pressure to form excimers.







Abstract
Pyrene aggregates, as classic luminescent materials, are of great interest from a scientific viewpoint owing to the development of optoelectronic materials. In this study, we designed a compound 1,4,5&#8208;triphenyl&#8208;2&#8208;(pyren&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;4,5&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole (IM&#8208;PY) which was achieved with two crystalline polymorphs (IMPY&#8208;G and IMPY&#8208;B). They exhibit the green emission and the blue emission, respectively, both with pyrene serving as the luminescent core. At ambient conditions, both phases exhibit &#960;&#8211;&#960; pyrene dimer stacking, but IMPY&#8208;B has the obviously smaller overlapping area and slightly shorter distance of pyrene planes than IMPY&#8208;G. During compression, the experiment results of photoluminescence, in&#8197;situ UV&#8208;vis absorption, time&#8208;resolved emission, and synchrotron angular dispersive X&#8208;ray diffraction, combined with theoretical calculations indicate that IMPY&#8208;B shows a more pronounced red&#8208;shifted photoluminescence spectra and forms excimers at higher pressure than IMPY&#8208;G. This fully reflects the influence of different stacking structures on the piezochromic phenomenon of aggregates, which is beneficial for expanding the application of pyrene aggregated state.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Monosubstituted [n]Paracyclophane using a Desymmetrization/Kinetic Resolution Sequence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 12, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective synthesis of monosubstituted [n]paracyclophanes enabled by Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond olefination of prochiral cyclophanes is discussed. The protocol combines desymmetrization and kinetic resolution, where desymmetrization is a key contributor to enantiocontrol and kinetic resolution enhances enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Optically pure monosubstituted [n]paracyclophanes are promising candidates for material synthesis, asymmetric catalysis, and drug discovery. Thus far, only a few catalytic asymmetric synthesis processes have been reported for assessing these strained atropisomers. In this study, we describe a highly enantioselective synthesis of monosubstituted [n]paracyclophanes by combining desymmetrization and kinetic resolution. The proposed protocol involves Pd&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective C&#8722;H bond olefination enabled by a monoprotected amino acid ligand, which affords a variety of monosubstituted [n]paracyclophanes with excellent enantioselectivity (&#8805;99&#8201;%ee). Thermodynamic experiments are conducted to investigate the racemization barrier. The synthesized monosubstituted [n]paracyclophanes exhibit vivid fluorescence and impressive circularly polarized luminescence. Further, the emission color and dissymmetry factor can be tuned and controlled by switching the substituent on the benzene ring of the cyclophanes.

Thus far, only a few catalytic asymmetric synthesis processes have been reported for assessing these strained atropisomers. In this study, we describe a highly enantioselective synthesis of monosubstituted [&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;]paracyclophanes by combining desymmetrization and kinetic resolution. The proposed protocol involves Pd-catalyzed atroposelective C&#8722;H bond olefination enabled by a monoprotected amino acid ligand, which affords a variety of monosubstituted [&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;]paracyclophanes with excellent enantioselectivity (&#8805;99&#8201;%&lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;). Thermodynamic experiments are conducted to investigate the racemization barrier. The synthesized monosubstituted [&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;]paracyclophanes exhibit vivid fluorescence and impressive circularly polarized luminescence. Further, the emission color and dissymmetry factor can be tuned and controlled by switching the substituent on the benzene ring of the cyclophanes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

An efficient I2&#8208;promoted Povarov reaction procedure for the synthesis of N&#8208;heteroaromatic benzothiazole and 2, 2&#8242;&#8208;biquinolines was disclosed. This protocol was characterized by broad substrate scope (49 examples, 31&#8211;80&#8201;% yields), large&#8208;scale synthesis, and product downstream derivatization. Based on the rotatable C&#8722;C bond of such bisheterocyclic compounds, compound 4a was successfully developed as a viscosity probe.







Abstract
A straightforward I2&#8208;promoted Povarov multicomponent reaction strategy for the synthesis of N&#8208;heteroaromatic benzothiazoles and 2, 2&#8242;&#8208;biquinolines was described. This methodology involved a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step procedure, tandem iodination/Kornblum oxidation, and [4+2] condensation. This protocol was characterized by broad scope of substrates (49 examples, 31&#8211;80&#8201;% yields), applicable for large&#8208;scale preparation, and downstream derivatization of the products. Photophysical property of the two classes of bisheteroaryl compounds was investigated. Based on the rotatable C&#8722;C bond, 2&#8208;(6&#8208;methylquinolin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzo[d]thiazole (4&#8201;a) was successfully developed as a viscosity probe, which opened up new hopes and prospects for biomedical applications.

         <title>Oligoethylene Phosphoramidate&#8208;Based Kinase Inhibitor Prodrugs &#8211; Solubility, Enzyme Inhibition, and Hydrolysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 12, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinase inhibitors are functionalized with oligoethylene glycol chains via a pH&#8208;labile linker, improving water solubility (optimal at n=3 &#8211; 4) while retaining enzyme inhibition and hydrolysis properties. This study highlights the impact of chain length on solubility, providing a versatile strategy for designing kinase inhibitor prodrugs.







Abstract
The efficiency of kinase inhibiting cancer therapeutics is often limited by their poor solubility in water. PEGylation is one possible strategy to improve the solubility of the drug, however, means to cleave off the PEG after reaching the target is important to make use of the therapeutic effects of the native drug. Moreover, the length of the PEG chains will have an effect on the solubility and binding. In this study, we want to extend our understanding of solubilizing oligo ethylene glycol (OEG) chains connected to kinase inhibitors using a pH labile phosphoramidate linker. We synthesize a library of drug&#8208;OEG conjugates for Ceritinib, Crizotinib, Palbociclib, and Ribocilib kinase inhibitors with n=2, 3, 4 and 8 OEG repeat units. We study the influence on water solubility, enzyme inhibition, and pH induced hydrolysis. A maximum in solubility is obtained for n=3 or 4. We show that small differences in chain length can strongly influence the water solubility, while all other properties remain relatively comparable.

         <title>Synthesis and Chiroptical Activity of &#960;&#8208;Expanded Electron&#8208;Rich Heterohelicenes Based on the 1,4&#8208;Dihydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole Core</title>

Only three steps are required to construct complex blue/green&#8208;emitting heterohelicenes encompassing 1,4&#8208;dihydropyrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole core. 6&#960;&#8208;Electrocyclization accompanied by HBr elimination is a key step and the course of 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization can be predicted using analysis of the LUMO orbital symmetry. The heterohelicenes possess fluorescence quantum yields up to 32&#8201;% and circularly polarized luminescence brightness reaching 30&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 in non&#8208;polar solvents.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis and chiroptical characteristics of the first (double) helicenes possessing the 1,4&#8208;dihydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole (DHPP) moiety as their central core. We have developed a three&#8208;step synthesis with 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization accompanied by HBr elimination as its key step. We found that, whereas for smaller peripheral arms double 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization occurs smoothly forming a double helicene, in the case of longer polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons the reaction becomes less efficient and mono&#8208;helicenes are the only products. The electron density distribution analysis of LUMO explains the different regioselectivity of 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization. The synthesized heterohelicenes are characterized by greenish&#8208;blue emission, distinct solvatofluorochromism and good fluorescence quantum yields (up to 42&#8201;%). Moreover, the chiroptical measurements reveal that unsymmetrical double heterohelicene exhibits excellent circularly polarized luminescence brightness (BCPL) reaching 30&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1. The combined experimental and computational study has revealed that a charge&#8208;transfer state is responsible for the observed emission (hence the solvatochromism), while low&#8208;energy absorption derives from multiple transitions.

         <title>A Unique Intramolecular Redox Reaction by Unidirectional Migration of Three Hydrogen Atoms: Theoretical Elucidation of the 3H&#8208;Transfer Sequence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 12, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detailed computational investigation was performed for two unidirectional multiple hydrogen rearrangements occurring in gaseous radical cations of 4&#8208;(N,N&#8208;dimethylamino)&#8208;2&#8208;butanol. Based on early mass spectrometry studies employing isotope labelling and on recent ion spectroscopic studies, our results provide a clear mechanistic picture for these peculiar redox processes discovered almost 40&#8197;years ago.







Abstract
The intramolecular migration of three hydrogen atoms from one moiety of a gaseous radical cation to the other prior to fragmentation is an extremely rare type of redox reaction. Within the scope of this investigation, this scenario requires an ionized but electron&#8208;rich arene acceptor bearing a para&#8208;(3&#8208;hydroxyalkyl) residue. The precise mechanism of such unidirectional 3H transfer processes, including the order of the individual H transfer steps, has remained unclear in spite of previous isotope labelling and recent infrared ion spectroscopy (IRIS) studies. Herein, the details of this peculiar process have been investigated for ionized 4&#8208;(N,N&#8208;dimethylaminophenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;butanol, 2, by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The energetically most favorable pathway consists of a sequence of successive 1,4&#8208;, 1,6&#8208; and 1,5&#8208;H steps. During these steps the secondary alcohol functionality is oxidized to a carbonyl group and the radical&#8208;cationic aniline ring is reduced to an ionized 2,3&#8211;dihydroaniline unit. Several alternative sequences, such as three successive 1,5&#8208;H shifts, could be excluded. A concomitant unidirectional 2H migration reaction of ion 2 was also investigated and the intermediacy of ion&#8208;neutral complexes (INCs) enabling sequential hydride and proton transfer was confirmed by the calculations.

         <title>Cover Feature: Design and Synthesis of Thioglycosylated Monolignol Dual Probes for Bioimaging of Lignin Biosynthesis (Chem. Eur. J. 12/2025)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 12, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature highlights the design and synthesis of thioglycosylated monolignol probes that were developed for the biological imaging of lignin biosynthesis. These innovative probes mimic monolignol glucosides (MLGs), which are hypothesized to play a role in monolignol transport and storage, though their exact function in lignin biosynthesis remains unclear. By incorporating a thioglycosyl moiety, these probes enable selective metabolic incorporation and facilitate the tracking of lignin biosynthesis in vivo. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Messaoudi, C. Biot and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202404117).

         <title>Cover Feature: DNA Origami Adsorption and Lattice Formation on Different SiOx Surfaces (Chem. Eur. J. 12/2025)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 12, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA origami triangles prefer smooth SiOx surfaces with high oxide density. On SiOx films grown by physical or chemical vapor deposition, DNA origami adsorption is strongly suppressed because of their low density and high roughness, respectively. In contrast, DNA origami triangles form ordered lattices upon adsorption on thermally grown and native SiOx films. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Keller and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202404108).

The Cover Feature depicts a hybrid BN&#8208;doped nanographene, its emission spectrum with its extraordinarily narrow main peak, and a solid&#8208;state organization diagram. Reminiscent of the natural purity of the landscape of Delaware (background), the state where the molecule was synthesized, emission color purity is essential for high&#8208;performance organic light emitting diodes. Based on screening efforts, the Research Article by V.&#8197;V. Diev and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202404078) describes the synthesis, characterization and OLED evaluation of a BN&#8208;containing candidate.

         <dc:description>
N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have widespread applications in synthesis as organocatalysts or ligands for organometallic complexes. This Mini&#8208;review article focuses on an important but often neglected area of their chemistry, where NHCs and their N&#8208;heterocyclic precursors or derivatives have been used as stoichiometric reagents or building blocks in organic synthesis.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have become important tools in modern synthetic chemistry due to their versatility as organocatalysts and ligands in organometallic complexes. Since their first isolation and characterization, NHCs have demonstrated significant utility in various catalytic processes, offering advantages such as strong &#963;&#8208;electron donation and the ability to stabilize reactive intermediates. However, beyond their well&#8208;documented roles in catalysis, the potential of NHCs as stoichiometric reagents and synthetic building blocks remains an underexplored yet promising area. This Mini&#8208;review aims to shed light on these lesser&#8208;known applications of NHCs and their N&#8208;heterocyclic precursors or derivatives in organic synthesis. Furthermore, we discuss how the unique electronic and steric properties of NHCs can be harnessed to develop new synthetic methodologies or construct interesting organic frameworks. By highlighting these emerging uses, we hope to encourage further research into the non&#8208;catalytic applications of NHCs, broadening their scope and impact in synthetic chemistry.

The review highlights recent advancements in site&#8208;selective modification and labeling of native RNA, an important area for the development of RNA therapeutics and fundamental RNA research. The applications, current challenges of existing methods and potential future direction of this field are also discussed.







Abstract
Ribonucleic acid (RNA) plays a pivotal role in regulating biological processes within living systems, with modified nucleosides serving as critical modulators of various aspects of biological functions. Therefore, the development of efficient methodologies for late&#8208;stage, site&#8208;selective RNA modification is of considerable interest, as it facilitates the functional exploration of RNA chemical modifications and their implications for therapeutic applications. Precise RNA modification holds significant promise for the treatment of genetic diseases by enabling the correction of mutated nucleobases to their wild&#8208;type forms. Additionally, the site&#8208;selective incorporation of synthetic labeling groups into RNA provides invaluable tools for structural and functional studies, thereby uncovering previously hidden dimensions of RNA&#8242;s role in biological systems. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of three principal approaches to site&#8208;selective, late&#8208;stage RNA modifications: enzyme&#8208;mediated strategies, catalytic nucleic acid&#8208;based techniques, and chemical methodologies. These approaches predominantly target the nucleobase or the 2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxyl (2&#8217;&#8208;OH) group of RNA nucleosides. We evaluate the advantages and limitations of each strategy and discuss future directions for advancing this field of research.

In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of three principal approaches to site-selective, late-stage RNA modifications: enzyme-mediated strategies, catalytic nucleic acid-based techniques, and chemical methodologies. These approaches predominantly target the nucleobase or the 2&#8217;-hydroxyl (2&#8217;-OH) group of RNA nucleosides.

         <title>4&#8208;Exo&#8208;Trig Radical Cyclization: A Promising Approach to Four&#8208;Membered Rings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig radical cyclization represents a formidable challenge owing to the unfavorable thermodynamics associated with the formation of highly strained four&#8208;membered rings. Stimulated by the explosive advancements of radical chemistry over the past decades, significant progresses have been made in this area, including the SmI2&#8208;mediated 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig carbonyl&#8208;alkene cyclization, n&#8208;Bu3SnH&#8208;mediated 4&#8208;exo cyclization of functionalized alkenes or alkynes, transition metal&#8208;catalyzed 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig ring closures, and visible light&#8208;induced 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization cascade, providing efficient protocols to overcome the inherent limitations and expand the synthetic utility of this methodology. Representative examples, reaction mechanism, scope and limitations, and synthetic applications are presented and discussed in detail. We believe that the systematic review of recent advances on 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig radical cyclization will provide more insights in this field, and may enable further development of this cyclization process for the concise synthesis of four&#8208;membered carbo&#8208; and heterocycles that are difficult to access via traditional methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfide Synthesis via A Bioinspired C&#8211;S &#963;&#8208;Bond Metathesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this manuscript, inspired by the natural S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM) cycle, we devised a mixed &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis between the (sp3)C&#8211;S bond of organic sulfides with the C&#8211;O bond of alcohols. This reaction is mediated by a readily available and operationally facile mixture of AlCl3 and ZnI2, which allows fast access to various challenging organic sulfides by directly editing the (sp3)C&#8211;S bond of easily available ones. Like multiple bond metathesis, this method could also be rendered intramolecular and extended to ether (sp3)C&#8211;O bond metathesis as well as amine (sp3)C&#8211;N bond metathesis to provide saturated heterocycles such as cyclic thioethers, cyclic ethers, as well as cyclic amines. Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations were carried out to show a high level of resemblance to the natural SAM cycle. We anticipate this bioinspired design of C&#8211;S/C&#8211;O metathesis will infuse the area of a &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis with more insights and provide opportunities for further advances in areas that have been facilitated by traditional C&#8211;X bond forming reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Interpenetrated Faujasite&#8208;Like Crystals from [4+4] Imine Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly of organic cages with 1,3,5&#8208;tribromo arene units have been studied in the solid state. Dimerization of the tribromo arene units by &#960;&#8208;stacking is found, resulting in porous structures as for example depicted here for a truncated [4+4] imine cage. If all four tribromo arene units form dimers, a Faujasite&#8208;type packing can result, which is found as two interpenetrating networks.







Abstract
In recent years, porous organic cages have gained in importance, inter alia, due to their ability to be processed from solution. Especially the packing of the cages in the solid state has a significant effect on the porosity. Therefore, it is important to be able to control the packing pattern either by crystallization conditions or the interaction of molecular units, defined as crystal engineering synthons. Here, tribromoarene subunits as such are incorporated into cage structures, namely a [2+3] and a [4+4] imine cage, to study the reliability of this subunit as crystal engineering synthon. Several solvatomorphs of both cages were studied by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and packing patterns thoroughly analyzed. Among those solvatomorphs an interpenetrated Faujasite&#8208;type supramolecular arrangement is found.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing insensitive heat&#8208;resistant energetic materials is currently a significant challenge in the research of energetic materials. In this study, two heat&#8208;resistant energetic materials (compounds 3 and 4) were designed and prepared by incorporating imino bridged (&#8722;NH&#8722;) the fused ring of pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidine. All the newly synthesized compounds exhibit excellent thermal stabilities (Td: 316.5&#8722;343.9 &#176;C) and good detonation performances (D: 8183&#8722;8206 m s&#8208;1), as well as satisfactory sensitivities (IS &gt; 40 J, FS &gt; 360 N). These remarkable stabilities are attributed to the &#960;&#8208;conjugated planar structures and strong weak interactions in crystals. The comprehensive performances of compound 4 (Td: 343.9 &#176;C, D: 8183 m s&#8208;1, IS &gt; 40 J, FS &gt; 360 N) are superior to those of the widely used heat&#8208;resistant explosive 2,2&#8242;,4,4&#8242;,6,6&#8242;&#8208;hexanitrostilbene (HNS) (Td: 318 &#176;C, D: 7612 m s&#8208;1, IS: 5 J, FS: 240 N), indicating its great potential to be used as heat&#8208;resistant and insensitive energetic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitrile&#8208;tolerant Iridium&#8208;catalysed Hydrogen Isotope Exchange</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we describe the first effective nitrile&#8208;tolerant homogeneous catalysis methodology for hydrogen isotope exchange via ortho&#8208;directed C(sp2)&#8722;H activation using air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable iridium pre&#8208;catalysts of the type Ir(COD)(NHC)Cl under an atmosphere of deuterium gas. This methodology delivers high levels of isotopic labelling under mild and practicable reaction conditions via a range of heterocyclic, ketone, and amine directing units.







Abstract
Isotopically labelled molecules are vital tools within drug discovery and are used extensively to assess a given candidate's absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) profile. Related to this, transition metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) has become a prominent technique for the rapid and selective late&#8208;stage installation of a deuterium or tritium label. Despite having a generally wide applicability, the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in this specific field is limited when particularly co&#8208;ordinating motifs are present within a given molecule to be labelled. For example, the exceptional binding strength and sterically unencumbered nature of the nitrile functionality leads to inhibition of catalyst turnover, and has hindered the development of efficient methods for the HIE of nitrile&#8208;containing molecules. Herein, in silico solvent binding energy parameter approaches have been disclosed which have facilitated the discovery of uniquely tolerant neutral iridium catalyst species that demonstrate a significantly lower binding strength with nitrile functionality. In turn, we describe the first effective nitrile&#8208;tolerant HIE methodology enabled via ortho&#8208;directed C(sp2)&#8722;H activation using air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable iridium pre&#8208;catalysts of the type Ir(COD)(NHC)Cl under an atmosphere of deuterium gas. This methodology proceeds under mild and practically accessible reaction conditions with a range of directing groups, including heterocycles, ketones, and amines, with this class of catalyst also shown to be applicable towards bioactive molecules, resulting in products with high levels of isotopic labelling.

Herein, &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; solvent binding energy parameter approaches have been disclosed which have facilitated the discovery of uniquely tolerant neutral iridium catalyst species that demonstrate a significantly lower binding strength with nitrile functionality. In turn, we describe the first effective nitrile-tolerant HIE methodology enabled &lt;i&gt;via ortho&lt;/i&gt;-directed C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H activation using air- and moisture-stable iridium pre-catalysts of the type Ir(COD)(NHC)Cl under an atmosphere of deuterium gas. This methodology proceeds under mild and practically accessible reaction conditions with a range of directing groups, including heterocycles, ketones, and amines, with this class of catalyst also shown to be applicable towards bioactive molecules, resulting in products with high levels of isotopic labelling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Theoretical Study on Binary Monolayers P3S&#8208;I for Photocatalytic Overall Water Plitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
P3S&#8722;I monolayer possesses suitable bandgap, appropriate band edge positions, high carrier mobility and large optical absorption coefficients. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) can react simultaneously at the P and S atoms, respectively, triggered merely by the photogenerated electrons and holes.







Abstract
The utilization of visible light to split water into H&#8322; and O&#8322; offers a promising solution to address the escalating global energy crisis and environmental pollution. Compared to conventional three&#8208;dimensional (3D) photocatalysts, anisotropic two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials exhibit enhanced photocatalytic activity due to their ultrahigh surface area, reduced charge migration distance, and improved efficiency. In this study, we employ a swarm&#8208;intelligence search combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations to propose a novel series of stable 2D phosphorus sulfides, PxSy (x, y=1&#8211;6), as promising candidates for photocatalytic water splitting. The P3S&#8722;I monolayer exhibits an optimal bandgap (2.485&#8197;eV), appropriate band edge positions (&#8722;3.52&#8197;eV for CBM and &#8722;6.00&#8197;eV for VBM at the HSE06 level), high carrier mobility (3246.85&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 for &#956;e along the y&#8208;direction and 1039.80&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 for &#956;h along the x&#8208;direction), and strong optical absorption coefficients (exceeding 1&#215;10&#8309;&#8197;cm&#8722;1 within the visible spectrum). Notably, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are facilitated concurrently at the P and S sites, respectively, driven exclusively by photogenerated electrons and holes. The P3S&#8722;I monolayer achieves a high photocatalytic water&#8208;splitting efficiency of 17.7&#8201;% in both acidic and neutral environments. These findings provide theoretical insights into the design of efficient 2D materials for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven overall water splitting.

         <title>Flavanone&#8208;enabled CuAAC Reaction: Noninnocent Reagents Driving a Mononuclear Mechanism Over the Dinuclear Paradigm</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The copper&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition reaction involving a naringenin derivative as both substrate and ligand leads to an efficient process via a mononuclear (Cu&#8208;catalyzed) mechanism, as elucidated by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry and reliable DFT calculations of the complete free energy profile.







Abstract
In this work, we report the use of the CuAAC (copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition) reaction to obtain different triazole derivatives bridged to the naringenin skeleton, leading to the combination of a triazole pharmacophoric group with a bioactive flavanone. The generation of Cu(I) active species was done using CuSO4 salts and sodium ascorbate, resulting in moderate to high yields when the DMSO&#8208;water binary system was used as solvents. Mechanistic studies were done using density functional theory calculations and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). We investigated the reduction process of Cu(II) to Cu(I), and the role of mononuclear and dinuclear copper species in the catalysis of the cycloaddition reaction. Our combined theoretical and experimental results indicate that the mechanism involving a single copper species is taking place, with the cycloaddition step being the rate&#8208;determining step. The calculations indicate that the mechanism involving two copper species has the deprotonation of the coordinated terminal alkyne as the rate&#8208;determining step.

         <title>Monitoring On&#8208;Surface Chemical Reactions by Low&#8208;Energy Electron Microscopy: from Conformation Change to Ring Closure in 2D Molecular Gas</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Employing on&#8208;surface synthesis we may prepare molecules that are not achievable otherwise. We follow the intramolecular ring&#8208;closure reaction on the Au(111) surface by low&#8208;energy electron microscopy and show that it takes place in the 2D molecular gas phase at elevated temperatures. This provides a key insight for understanding the mechanism of on&#8208;surface reactions.







Abstract
On&#8208;surface synthesis is a promising strategy for the preparation of molecules that are not achievable otherwise. Understanding the mechanism of on&#8208;surface reactions requires knowledge of the molecular structure and possible organization of reactants into supramolecular assemblies during the reaction. Scanning probe techniques are essential for the unambiguous identification of the products and for determining their electronic and magnetic properties. However, these are generally not capable of imaging the surface at reaction conditions and, therefore, answering some of the key questions about the reaction mechanism. Here, we show that real&#8208;time low&#8208;energy electron microscopy (LEEM) can monitor the surface processes in real time and provide the necessary complementary mechanistic insights into on&#8208;surface reactions. We monitor the intramolecular ring&#8208;closure reaction of 1,3,5&#8208;tris(7&#8208;methyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;carbolin&#8208;6&#8208;yl)benzene on the Au(111) surface and show that it takes place in the 2D molecular gas phase at elevated temperatures. Products condense into separate islands upon cooling, enabling fast and efficient assessment of product yields. This makes LEEM an efficient tool for studying intramolecular chemical reactions.

Abstract
We report an efficient and practical protocol for the generation of halogen (Br and Cl) radicals using inexpensive and readily available N&#8208;bromo/N&#8208;chlorosuccinimide (NXS) and t&#8208;butylhydroperoxide (TBHP) at rt. The NXS/TBHP reagent systems are demonstrated for site&#8208;selective bromination and chlorination of the benzene&#8208;core of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones. It is shown that the reagent system permits regioselective halogenation at the C7 position of the benzene core over the readily&#8208;functionalized C3 position of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones under mild reaction conditions. We further show that terminal alkynes can be converted to gem&#8208;dihaloketones in a facile manner by NXS/TBHP. Mechanistically, single electron transfer between TBHP and NXS leads to instantaneous formation of electrophilic halogen radicals, which attack arenes and alkynes.

         <title>Tuning the Efficiency of Iridium(III) Complexes for Energy Transfer (EnT) Catalysis through Ligand Design</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of heteroleptic Iridium(III) complexes, which can act as Energy Transfer (EnT) photocatalysts, has been prepared and tested in photochemical transformations. Our study explores ligand design and its impact on the photophysical properties of the complexes and their catalytic performance. Naphthyl pendants enhance triplet intermediate stabilization in energy&#8208;transfer reactions via radical&#8208;&#960; dispersion interactions, leading to superior catalytic efficiency.







Abstract
Photoactive Iridium(III) complexes are a popular synthetic tool. The impact of ligand design on their photoredox properties has been widely studied, but similar approaches to develop more potent photosensitizers are still absent. We report herein the preparation, characterization and catalytic application of a new family of Iridium(III) complexes that proved superior to their widely&#8208;used commercial peers. The best results were observed when naphthyl pendants were installed to the ligands, which could stabilize the triplet intermediates involved in energy&#8208;transfer reactions via radical&#8208;&#960; dispersion interactions.

         <title>Understanding the Nitrogen Reduction Reaction Mechanism on CuFeO2 Photocathodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We provide a detailed analysis of the nitrogen reduction mechanism on the pristine and oxygen defective (012) surface of CuFeO2. DFT+U calculations examine the stability of reaction intermediates and provide mechanistic insights. Beyond that, we shed light on the active sites&#8217; orbital contributions and the oxygen defects&#8217; electronic impact.

This study investigates the reaction pathways for the conversion of

 ${{\rm{CuFeO}}_2 }$



 (CFO) by employing density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Concentrating on the most stable (012) surface orientation, two systems were examined: the pristine (012) surface and the corresponding oxygen defective surface. To find the thermodynamic stable pathway, the associative Heyrovsk&#253; mechanism was considered, containing four different reaction pathways. The reaction intermediates predominantly interact with the iron sites on the surface, following the distal alternating reaction pathway via the formation of hydrazine. Introducing oxygen defects changes the reaction mechanism to a Mars&#8722;van&#8208;Krevelen&#8208;type mechanism, avoiding the formation of hydrazine, while the Gibbs free energy of the first hydrogenation step is lowered by 1.17&#8197;eV (from 2.17 to 1.00&#8197;eV). Analyzing the charge density distribution reveals that an oxygen defective surface enables CFO to facilitate a

&#8722;backdonation between iron sites and the reaction intermediates, increasing the intermediate&#8722;surface interaction. This indicates an enhanced catalytic activity for the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) by generating oxygen lattice defects in CFO.

         <title>Ball&#8208;Milling Assisted Synthesis of Monofluoroalkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanochemical Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons reaction enabled the formation of monofluoroalkenes with yields up to 99&#8201;%. The solid&#8208;state reaction condition allowed the formation of a broad scope of trisubstituted and tetrasubstituted fluorinated alkenes (48 examples) with the use of a weak base and a short reaction time from aldehydes of ketones. Moreover, the reaction conditions proved to be broadly applicable to various fluorophosphonoacetates, providing access to valuable fluorinated compounds.







Abstract
A solvent&#8208;free synthesis of valuable monofluoroalkenes was developed under ball&#8208;milling agitation. The use of 1.0&#8197;equivalent of carbonyl substrates and 1.1&#8197;equivalent of fluorophosphonoacetate derivatives with a weak inorganic base enabled the formation of the desired products after 30&#8197;min of reaction under sustainable conditions with minimized synthetic waste. No sequential addition of base, fluorophosphonate, and carbonyl substrates was needed, and the desired products were obtained with high purity only after a simple filtration. The protocol showed general efficiency and tolerance to a large panel of carbonyl substrates including aldehydes and ketones, as well as fluorophosphonoacetate derivatives with moderate stereoselectivities and yields ranging from 21&#8201;% to 99&#8201;% (48 examples).

         <title>Delayed Fluorescence and Room Temperature Phosphorescence from a Liquid Arene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Homotruxene, a promising class of twisted polycyclic aromatic compounds, had its structure modified by insertion of branched alkoxy chains, resulting in the first report of a neat liquid presenting Triplet&#8208;Triplet Annihilation at room temperature, as well as phosphorescence lasting up to 50&#8197;ms.







Abstract
Delayed emission (DF) of fluorescence is generally observed either in solution or in the crystalline state. In the latter, well&#8208;defined intermolecular interactions may play a significant role in defining the emission characteristics. Here, we present a trialkoxy&#8208;homotruxene that is liquid at room temperature and compare its emission behavior with that of a crystalline analog containing the same &#960;&#8208;electron system. The DF observed is due to triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA) and persists at low temperatures (90&#8197;K). Accompanied by slightly shorter phosphorescence and DF lifetimes, the singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap increased by 4&#8201;% compared to the crystalline homolog. The replacement of methyl groups with racemic branched alkoxy chains in homotruxene derivatives proves efficient in suppressing crystallization without significantly altering DF. In neat films, the compound exhibited TTA&#8208;DF at room temperature, phosphorescence lasting up to 50&#8197;ms and Photoluminescence Quantum Yield (PLQY) of 24&#8201;%. Thus, TTA&#8208;DF persists in a single&#8208;component isotropic liquid phase, showing both molecular and aggregate emissions, only slightly affected by the absence of periodic molecular stacking.

         <title>Selective On&#8208;Surface Metalation and Uncommon Reordering of Self&#8208;Assembled Macrocyclic Biquinazoline Ligands on Ag(111)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective metalation of the macrocyclic biquinazoline (Mabiq) ligand via exposure to a cobalt atom beam was realized on the Ag(111) surface, causing complete transformation of the self&#8208;assembly packing arrangement. This work reveals the promise as well as possible hurdles for constructing a bimetallic network based on the Mabiq building block.







Abstract
The macrocyclic biquinazoline ligand, H&#8208;Mabiq, presents a central and a peripheral site for the coordination of metal atoms, making the adsorption on solid surfaces promising for the creation of self&#8208;assembled bimetallic two&#8208;dimensional platforms. Here, we apply an on&#8208;surface metalation strategy under ultra&#8208;high vacuum conditions to guide the synthesis of metalated species and study sequential metalation patterns. We find that cobalt (as well as iron) metalation on the Ag(111) surface preferentially occurs at the macrocyclic centre without further metal coordination to the peripheral site. Nevertheless, starting from a densely packed, self&#8208;assembled H&#8208;Mabiq monolayer, the modification of the central cavity by Co is accompanied by an unusual, metalation&#8208;induced phase transformation, which gives evidence of modified lateral / interfacial interactions. The selective metalation of one molecular site opens up an on&#8208;surface route to create bimetallic networks incorporating select metal ions at different locations.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fragment&#8208;based approach is effective in drug design and protein assemblies but remains underexplored for biomaterial construction in aqueous environments. This study presents the first integration of self&#8208;assembling fragments to design a small organic molecule forming polymorphic nanotubes. Its compact structure enables hierarchical assembly, demonstrating a flexible strategy for supramolecular biomaterials in water&#8208;based systems.







Abstract
A fragment&#8208;based approach has proven successful in drug design and protein assemblies, yet its potential for constructing biomaterials from simple organic building blocks remains underexplored, particularly for self&#8208;assembly in aqueous phases, where water disrupts intermolecular hydrogen bonding. To the best of our knowledge, this study introduces the first case of integrating fragments from self&#8208;assembling molecules to design a small organic molecule that forms novel hierarchical nanotubes with polymorphism. The molecule's compact design incorporates three structural motifs derived from known nanotube assemblies, enabling a hierarchical assembly process: individual molecules with two conformations form dimers, which organize into hexameric units. These hexamers further assemble into nanotubes comprising 2&#8208;, 5&#8208;, and 6&#8208;protofilament fibers. The nanofibers share a nearly identical asymmetric unit &#8211; a hexameric triangular plate &#8211; with similar axial and lateral interfaces. The lateral interface, involving interactions between phosphate groups and aromatic rings, exhibits plasticity, allowing slight rotational variations between adjacent units. This adaptability facilitates the formation of diverse nanofiber architectures, showcasing the flexibility of these systems in aqueous environments. By leveraging fragments of self&#8208;assembling molecules, this work demonstrates a straightforward strategy that combines conformational flexibility and self&#8208;assembling fragments to construct advanced supramolecular biomaterials from small organic building blocks in aqueous settings.

         <title>A Conjugated Porous Organic Polymer as a Metal&#8208;Free Bifunctional Electrocatalyst for Enhanced Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#960;&#8208;conjugated porous organic polymer containing imine and triazine functional moieties was explored as a metal&#8208;free bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water&#8208;splitting in the alkaline medium.







Abstract
A conjugated porous organic polymer (SMCOP&#8208;4) with imine linkage and triazine functional moiety was rationally designed and synthesized by an imine condensation reaction. The &#960;&#8208;conjugated network of SMCOP&#8208;4 facilitates electron mobility, enhancing electrochemical activity. Metal&#8208;free electrocatalyst SMCOP&#8208;4 shows superior performance for HER and OER with a low overpotential of 139&#8197;mV and 295&#8197;mV, respectively, at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 current density and with small Tafel slopes in alkaline electrolytes. Along with the low overpotential values, the electrocatalyst is highly stable at electrochemical conditions. Further, density functional theory calculations were carried out to identify the most active sites in catalyzing the HER and OER on the SMCOP&#8208;4 catalyst.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Redox Divergent Hydrated Ring Expansion of Butafulvenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regio&#8208; and redox divergent hydrated ring expansion of butafulvenes has been developed to construct highly substituted unsaturated cyclopentanone derivatives. The unsaturated cyclopentanone product could undergo divergent transformations and serve as a key intermediate to create skeletal editing compounds of butafulvenes via one&#8208;pot protocol, which highlights the potential applications of this strategy.







Abstract
By providing highly functionalized building blocks in an efficient approach, catalytic hydration of alkenes plays a significant role in fundamental chemical transformations and pharmaceutical synthesis. However, hydration reactions have predominantly involved addition reactions of water and alkenes double bond. Herein, we developed a regio&#8208; and redox divergent hydrated ring expansion protocol of butafulvenes. With the aid of PdII or acid catalysis, various highly functionalized and unsaturated cyclopentanone derivatives could be obtained in high regioselectivities under oxidative or redox neutral conditions. Isotope labeling experiments suggest that the carbonylic oxygen atom of target product is derived from water. In addition, the unsaturated cyclopentanone intermediate could undergo divergent transformations and serve as a key molecule to create skeletal editing compounds of butafulvenes via one&#8208;pot protocol, which highlights the potential applications of this strategy.

         <title>Cooperative Photoredox Catalysis Under Confinement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoredox catalysis has emerged as a potent means to conduct synthetic chemistry. Leveraging light to achieve challenging organic transformations has led to many developments, both of fundamental and industrial nature. Despite their potency, photoredox processes are inherently diffusion controlled, which can limit their ability to enable both reactivity and selectivity. Relevant to this is the idea of colocalizing cocatalysts in architectures that enable spatial proximity, promoting &#8216;catalysis under confinement.&#8217; In this Concept review, we summarize recent designs and advancements using well&#8208;defined heterogeneous and homogeneous frameworks that enable dual photoredox catalysis, such as metal&#8208;organic frameworks, heterogeneous organic polymeric systems, and single&#8208;chain polymer nanoparticles (SCNPs). These advances generally stem from the material&#8217;s inherent ability to enforce catalyst communication, typically resulting in expedient radical, electron, or energy transfer that accelerates reactivity. Whereas heterogeneous systems are comprehensively investigated, the design space arising from the modularity and versatility of a SCNP is quite large making the recyclable platform an intriguing candidate to investigate for confinement&#8208;enabled photoredox catalysis. We expect that both heterogeneous and homogeneous platforms systems detailed herein will continue to exhibit superior performance, while underscoring the importance of confinement to tackle diffusion&#8208;limited reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Confined Structural Water Molecules as Alternative Potential Emitters for Bright Photoluminescence of Thiolate&#8208;gold Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The debate about water as an emitter has spanned nearly a century, but how it emits bright colors remains elusive. In this report, using the widely used Au(I)&#8208;alkanethiolate complex (Au(I)&#8208;SRs, R = &#8208;(CH2)12H) with AIE properties as a model system, by carefully manipulating the delicate surface&#8208;ligand interactions at the nanoscale interface, together with a careful spectral investigation and an isotopic diagnostic experiment of heavy water (D2O), we demonstrated that the structural water molecules (SWs) trapped in the nanoscale interface or space are the true emission centers of metal nanoclusters (NCs) and the aggregates of Au(I)&#8208;SRs complexes, instead of a well&#8208;organized metal core dominated by quantum confinement mechanics. Unlike conventional hydrogen&#8208;bonded water molecules, due to interfacial adsorption or spatial confinement, the p&#8208;orbitals of two O atoms in SWs can form strong electronic interactions through spatial overlap, thus constructing a set of interfacial states, one of which is characterized by &#960;&#8208;bonding, thus providing alternative channels (or paths) for the relaxation decay of the excited electrons. Using the one&#8208;dimensional free&#8208;electron gas model, the energy levels calculated by the Schr&#246;dinger equation are in perfect agreement with the experimental observations, further validating the SWs model.</dc:description>

In this paper, we describe the design, synthesis and evaluation of a new kind of adjustable axially chiral cyclic biphenyl ligands and catalysts derived from axially chiral cyclic biphenyldiols, and four representative examples were performed well including enantioselective alkynylation of benzo[e][1,2,3]oxathiazine 2,2&#8208;dioxide under catalysis of (R)&#8208;cyclic [1,1'&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;2,2'&#8208;diol/ZnMe2, palladium&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative cycloaddition of 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;4&#8208;vinyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolan&#8208;2&#8208;one with 2&#8208;arylidenemalononitriles in the presence of axially chiral cyclic phosphoramidite ligand, and axially chiral cyclic phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition of styryl&#8208;1H&#8208;indole with cyclic 2,4&#8208;dienones and asymmetric Michael addition of indolizine to cyclopentenediones. The experiments showed that variation of 2,2'&#8208;substituent groups could provide different kinds of axially chiral cyclic ligands and catalysts, variation of steric and electronic properties (by changing substituent groups at the 3,3',5,5'&#8208;positions) and dihedral angles (by changing ring sizes at 6,6'&#8208;positions) could greatly change catalytic efficiency of ligands and catalysts derived from axially chiral cyclic biphenyldiols. The high reactivity and stereoselectivity of the reactions were effectively achieved through the precise regulation of multi&#8208;sites on our axially chiral cyclic biphenyldiols.</dc:description>

         <title>A Luminescent Stable Triarylmethyl Diradical with an Axially Chiral Spacer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two units of a highly stable luminescent triarylmethyl radical (PyBTM) were bridged using a chiral octahydrobinaphthyl moiety, resulting in a diradical with sufficient stability to enable the measurement of its chiroptical properties. To synthesize this diradical, a novel boronic ester radical precursor, &#945;H&#8208;PyBTM&#8208;B(Epin), was designed. The use of this precursor significantly improved the yield and streamlined the preparation of stable luminescent radical&#8208;substituted molecules. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of the diradical was measured to be 10% in chloroform. Furthermore, both circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) were successfully observed.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Defined Layered 2D Sulfur Nanosheets from 0D Sulfur Dots and their Use in the&#160;Photocatalytic Oxidative Coupling of Aryl Amines&#160;to Aromatic Azo Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly defined multi&#8208;layered 2D sulphur nanosheets have been prepared from 0D sulphur dots by hydrothermal based growth process. Slow transformation of sulphur dots to sulphur sheets allow reorganization of elemental sulphur and sulphur containing functional groups, resulting higher crystallinity in sulphur nanosheets with respect to sulphur dots. It is further correlated with the detailed photophysical studies. Low temperature photoluminescence spectra confirm that the exciton binding energy of 2D sulphur sheets are lower than 0D sulphur dots. The exciton&#8208;phonon coupling is also higher in sulphur sheet with respect to sulphur dots. Overall, the photoinduced charge separation process improves throughout the highly defined 2D matrix of sulphur sheets. It is further supported by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and transient photocurrent studies. Finally, both sulphur dots and sulphur sheets have been used for photocatalytic azo bond formation where both photoinduced electrons and holes have been utilized simultaneously. Results suggest almost 3 folds enhancement in catalytic efficiency for sulphur sheets with respect to sulphur dots without any metal cocatalyst. Controlled experiments suggest that the azo bond formation happens through complete photocatalysis process. Detailed mechanism has been proved by identifying the intermediates and free radicals through photo&#8208;responsive EPR studies and various chemical scavenging experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>Multigram Scale Synthesis of Mechanically&#8208;Interlocked Derivatives of SWNT Using Mechanochemical Methods</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The grinding of chemical reagents enables mixing, promotes molecular collisions, and provides the thermal energy required for chemical reactions, while reducing the need for solvent (often to none) and significantly speeding up reactions. This has made mechanochemistry a powerful alternative to traditional solution chemistry. Here, we show that mechanically interlocked derivatives of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (MINTs) can be made via mechanochemistry in a multigram scale. Compared to the previously reported method in suspension, mechanochemistry allows us to reduce the amount of solvent by two orders of magnitude and the reaction time from 72 h to 5 min. The mechanochemical synthesis of MINTs is proven to work both with purified (6,5)&#8208;SWNTs and affordable TuballTM SWNTs, enabling the cheap, fast, and environmentally friendly multigram scale synthesis of MINTs. With this new synthetic methodology, we open the door to the real&#8208;world applications of MINTs in fields such as polymer composites.</dc:description>

         <title>Deoxygenative Cyclopropanation of Aldehydes with Acyl&#8208;Stabilized Sulfur Ylides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we described a novel [1+1+1] deoxygenative cyclopropanation between sulfur ylides and aldehydes, which is distinctive from traditional epoxidation reactions. The method offers a straightforward approach for the synthesis of highly stereoselective, functionalized, and structurally diverse tertiary cyclopropyl thioethers. The reaction demonstrates a broad substrate scope and excellent compatibility with various functional groups, rendering it particularly suitable for the late&#8208;stage modifications of pharmaceuticals and natural products, as well as the synthesis of structurally diverse compounds. Additionally, &#946;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted enals can also engage in the deoxygenative cyclopropanation reaction, instead of undergoing classic cyclopropanation through a Michael addition reaction&#8208;induced cyclization with sulfur ylides, thus yielding synthetically important vinylcyclopropanes with excellent chemoselectivity and diastereoselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Dual Nature of the Smallest Aqueous Ferrocene Complex.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structure of the ferrocene&#8208;water ((Cp)2Fe:H2O) complex has been characterized by combining state of the art rotational spectroscopy and computational chemistry. Two structures have been retrieved experimentally where water interacts with two distinguished binding sites, the exo Cp &#960; cloud and the planetary&#8208;like planar orbit around iron. The spectra of both conformers exhibit significant averaging effects due to the nearly free rotational dynamics of water. This is in good agreement with the exploration of the potential energy surface of (Cp)2Fe:H2O. For water interacting with the exo Cp &#960; cloud, we found three axial conformers giving rise to twenty minima with small internal rotation barriers. Theoretical calculations reveal two minima for the observed equatorial complex. Water interacts with ferrocene quite strongly, exhibiting binding energies above &#8208;11 kJ/mol in all binding sites and contributing to small deformations in the structure of bare ferrocene.</dc:description>

         <title>Design and Properties of Azaacene&#8208;Fused Porphyrins: Extending&#160;&#960;&#8208;Systems for NIR&#8208;II Absorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of porphyrins featuring various azaacene moieties were designed with the aim to explore the structure&#8211;property relationships in extended azaacene systems. The introduction of azaacene groups significantly enhanced the solubility of these chromophores while directly influencing their electronic absorption and emission properties, enabling absorption at longer wavelengths. Protonation of the azaacene&#8208;fused porphyrins further extended their absorption into the NIR&#8208;II region. The &#960;&#8208;system extension provided by the new appended diamino aromatic groups were therefore investigated through electrochemical, photophysical, XRD structural studies and complemented by theoretical calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Design, Synthesis, and Biophysical Characterization of Pyridine Bis&#8208;Quinazoline Derivatives as Selective G&#8208;Quadruplex DNA Stabilizers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;canonical G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) DNA structures play key roles in cellular regulation and are promising targets for cancer therapy. This study reports the design, synthesis, and biophysical evaluation of 15 novel pyridine bis&#8208;quinazoline derivatives for their ability to selectively bind and stabilize G4 DNA structures. The pyridine&#8208;bis&#8208;quinazoline central fragment was synthesized with various amine side chains via a 4&#8211;5 step sequence in high yields. Comprehensive analyses using different fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays, fluorescence intercalator displacement (FID), circular dichroism (CD), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) assays revealed strong G4 stabilization and selectivity over double&#8208;stranded DNA. The presence and composition of the&#160;aliphatic amine side chain proved critical and&#160;propylamine linkers exhibited superior performance, achieving &#916;Tm&#160;values exceeding 20 &#176;C and dissociation constants in the nanomolar range. Structural preferences were observed for parallel and hybrid G4 topologies, and the ligands induced minimal conformational changes in G4 DNA upon binding.&#160;Finally, cell viability assays on HCT&#8208;8 and HepG2 cancer cell lines revealed that most ligands effectively entered the cells and decreased cancer cell viability in a dose&#8208;dependent manner.&#160;These findings underline the potential of pyridine bis&#8208;quinazoline derivatives as selective G4&#8208;stabilizing agents, paving the way for further exploration in anticancer drug development.</dc:description>

         <title>Isolation and Characterization of [MnFe(CO)10]+: the Missing Link in the 3d Dimetal Decacarbonyl Series</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The heterodinuclear dimetal decacarbonyl cation [MnFe(CO)10]+ has been synthesized by combining the metalloradical [Fe(CO)5]+&#8729; with half an equivalent of Mn2(CO)10. The complex was subsequently isolated and characterized using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;Ray Diffraction (scXRD), as well as IR, Raman, NMR and M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy. Experimental results, complemented by DFT calculations of the relaxed force constants and an analysis of the electron density, reveal that the interaction between the two {M(CO)5} fragments in [MnFe(CO)10]+ is in between a covalent and a dative bond, representing a borderline case between the 2x17 VE and the 16+18 VE electron counting. Additionally, the known isoelectronic anion [CrMn(CO)10]&#8722; was prepared as its [PPN]+ salt and characterized for the first time by scXRD. These finding complete the series of structurally characterized isoelectronic dimetal decacarbonyls, spanning from [Cr2(CO)10]2&#8722; to [Fe2(CO)10]2+, the characteristics of all of which are compared based on experiment and theory.</dc:description>

         <title>Global Spectral Analysis of Polaritonic Coupling of Multiple Organic Dyes to a Tunable Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot Resonator Operating with Mirror Separations up to 10 &#181;m</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We study strong optical coupling and the formation of hybrid polaritons by a donor&#8208;acceptor pair of J&#8208;aggregated dyes separated by up to 11 &#181;m in a tunable Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot resonator. Fitting a phenomenological Hamiltonian to the white light transmission spectra of different cavity&#8208;J&#8208;aggregate&#8208;configurations, for which several hundred spectra were recorded sequentially as function of cavity length, allows us to determine coupling energies as a function of the effective cavity distances. The theoretical analysis shows that certain hybrid polaritons contain contributions from both dyes, making this system a promising platform for polariton&#8208;mediated energy transfer at very large distances.</dc:description>

         <title>Precision Stealth Nanofibers via PET&#8208;RAFT Polymerisation: Synthesis, Crystallization&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Assembly and Cellular Uptake Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stealth precision polymer nanofibers show great promise as therapeutic delivery systems. Yet existing systems are largely limited to poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and suffer from challenging functionalization, hampering their translation. This work develops a modular, easily functionalizable platform for biocompatible stealth nanofibers based on a combination of ring&#8208;opening polymerisation (ROP), photoinduced electron/energy transfer reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (PET&#8208;RAFT) polymerisation, and crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA). Low length&#8208;dispersity poly(fluorenetrimethylenecarbonate)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(N&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide) (PFTMC&#8208;b&#8208;PHPMA) nanofibers can be produced in a single&#8208;step via CDSA, with a length that is dependent on the PHPMA DPn. Separately, living CDSA leads to nanofibers with length control between 30 nm and ca. 700 nm. Incorporation of fluorescein into the PET&#8208;RAFT polymerization results in fluorescent block PFTMC&#8208;b&#8208;PHPMA polymers that can undergo CDSA, forming fluorescent nanoparticles for preliminary cell studies. PFTMC&#8208;b&#8208;PHPMA nanofibers exhibited minimal toxicity to cells as well as limited cellular association, in line with previous studies on neutral polymer nanofibers. In comparison, PFTMC&#8208;b&#8208;PHPMA nanospheres exhibited no cellular association. These results indicate that the unique shape and core&#8208;crystallinity of PFTMC&#8208;b&#8208;PHPMA nanofibers ideally positions them for use as therapeutic delivery systems. Overall, these results provide the basis for a modular, easily functionalizable platform for precision stealth polymer nanofibers for a variety of&#160;biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Preparation Methods of Metal Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal nanoclusters, also known as ultrasmall nanoparticles, represent a promising class of nanomaterials due to their atomically precise characterizations and intriguing chemical&#8208;physical properties. The preparation is the cornerstone for advancing the nanocluster science, facilitating their structural determination, property investigation, and practical application. Our group has been devoted to exploring new and efficient approaches for the high&#8208;yield preparation of metal nanoclusters with customized structures and properties. Four methodologies have been proposed and developed in our group for the nanocluster preparation, including kinetic control, seeded growth, in situ two&#8208;phase ligand exchange, and metal exchange. More than 200 metal nanoclusters have been synthesized and structurally determined, laying the foundation for the elucidation of structure evolutions and structure&#8208;property correlations. In this concept, we emphasized our progress in proposing and developing the synthetic mythologies of metal nanoclusters. This Concept hopefully provides researchers attempting to study the preparation methods of metal nanoclusters with a synthetic toolbox.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled pyrolysis of bromine&#8208;modulated metal&#8208;organic framework for solvent&#8208;free and co&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free cycloaddition of CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides to synthesize cyclic carbonates is a crucial but challenging process. In particular, the co&#8208;catalyst required for higher yields in this reaction inevitably dissolves in organic solvents, resulting in product impurities and solvent&#8208;related hazards. Therefore, a heterogeneous catalyst that delivers high yields under solvent&#8208;free and co&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free conditions is highly desirable. In this study, we propose a controlled pyrolysis strategy to develop a metal&#8208;organic framework&#8208;derived catalyst that innovatively incorporates bromine via a C&#8211;Br bond.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides to synthesize cyclic carbonates is a crucial but challenging process. In particular, the co-catalyst required for higher yields in this reaction inevitably dissolves in organic solvents, resulting in product impurities and solvent-related hazards. Therefore, a heterogeneous catalyst that delivers high yields under solvent-free and co-catalyst-free conditions is highly desirable. In this study, we propose a controlled pyrolysis strategy to develop a metal-organic framework-derived catalyst that innovatively incorporates bromine via a C&#8211;Br bond. EXAFS, FT-IR and XPS analyses reveal the co-presence of unsaturated Zn sites and C&#8211;Br bonds, which act as acid and base sites, respectively. The synergy between these sites prevents bromine leakage and facilitates the ring-opening of epoxides, thereby overcoming the barriers in the cycloaddition reaction. As a result, this catalyst achieves superior catalytic performance with over 99% yield of propylene carbonates under solvent-free and co-catalyst-free conditions. The resulting propylene carbonate can be used directly as an electrolyte in battery applications without further purification.

         <title>Exploring n&#8208;&#960;* Electronic Transitions in Graphitic Carbon Nitride: Fundamentals, Strategies, and Photocatalytic Advances</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalysis utilizes solar energy to drive redox reactions, offering a promising solution to global energy and environmental challenges. Up to now, graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) has been widely studied due to its unique organic structural framework and favourable electronic properties. However, its photocatalytic efficiency is often constrained by a limited light absorption range (up to ~ 460 nm) and modest charge&#8208;carrier mobility. Recent findings suggest that n&#8208;&#960;* electronic transitions can extend the absorption edge of g&#8208;C3N4 to approximately 600 nm, enhancing the activity. Herein, we first outline the fundamental structural and electronic features of g&#8208;C3N4, highlighting the role of both n&#8208;&#960;* electronic transitions. We then provide a comprehensive overview of various strategies for activating n&#8208;&#960;* transitions, emphasizing the necessity of distorting the planar and symmetric tri&#8208;s&#8208;triazine units to enable this transition. The subsequent sections demonstrate how modulating n&#8208;&#960;* transitions can broaden the light absorption spectrum and facilitate more efficient charge separation, thereby enhancing photocatalytic processes. Finally, we propose potential future directions for exploiting n&#8208;&#960;* transitions to further advance g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;based photocatalysts. This review aims to fill a gap in the literature by providing a focused summary of n&#8208;&#960;* transitions in g&#8208;C3N4 and their significance for sustainable energy and environmental applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Formal Umpolung Strategy for the Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Branched Amides via &#945;&#8208;Sulfenylnitro Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amide compounds are essential structural motifs found in natural products, pharmaceuticals, peptides and materials. A novel formal umpolung strategy for an efficient synthesis of &#945;&#8208;branched amides was developed, employing nitroalkenes, Grignard reagents and amines as reacting components. The synthesis involves the formation of &#945;&#8208;sulfenylnitro intermediates, which undergo oxidative amidation under optimized conditions using tert&#8208;butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) as an oxidant and K2CO3 as a base. The key intermediate, an &#945;&#8208;sulfenylnitro compound, was successfully synthesized in a one&#8208;pot operation. This methodology demonstrates a broad substrate scope, accommodating various amines, including primary and secondary amines as well as amino acid derivatives, and yielding the corresponding &#945;&#8208;branched amides in high efficiency. The sulfenyl nitro scaffold proved particularly effective, offering both stability and reactivity. The developed process simplifies the preparation of &#945;&#8208;branched amides and expands the accessible structural diversity.</dc:description>

         <title>Ba2BP7N14 &#8211; A Quaternary Alkaline Earth Nitridoborophosphate with a Mixed 3D Network Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The alkaline earth nitridoborophosphate Ba2BP7N14 was synthesized under high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature conditions. The crystal structure reveals a 3D&#8208;network of PN4 and mixed occupied (P0.75B0.25)N4 tetrahedra and was determined using a multi&#8208;step characterization process including SCXRD, PXRD, elemental analysis, electron microscopy and NMR spectroscopy. Furthermore, materials properties were investigated. This approach provides first insights into mixed quaternary AE&#8211;B&#8211;P&#8211;N systems.







Abstract
Highly condensed alkaline earth nitridophosphates have attracted increasing scientific interest, due to their high thermal and chemical stability, as well as their promising luminescence behavior upon doping with Eu2+ for pc&#8208;LED applications. In particular, the barely explored mixed tetrahedra&#8208;based nitridophosphates offer a wide range of structural and compositional diversity, enabling new insights into structure&#8208;property relationships. Herein, we report on the first quaternary alkaline earth nitridoborophosphate Ba2BP7N14, synthesized at 8&#8197;GPa and 1600&#8201;&#176;C in a multianvil press, starting from Ba(N3)2, h&#8208;BN and P3N5. Ba2BP7N14 crystallizes in the barylite&#8208;1O polytype and features a highly condensed mixed (B,P)&#8211;N anionic 3D network (&#954;&#8776;0.57) built up of PN4 and mixed occupied (P0.75B0.25)N4 tetrahedra. The structure was characterized by a multi&#8208;step process involving single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD, PXRD), elemental analysis, electron microscopy (STEM, EELS), and solid&#8208;state 31P and 11B MAS NMR spectroscopy. The plausibility of the structural model was corroborated by low&#8208;cost crystallographic calculations. The optical band gap and the thermal behavior of an undoped sample of Ba2BP7N14, were determined from diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and temperature&#8208;dependent powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, respectively. Irradiation of a Eu2+&#8208;doped sample with near&#8208;UV light results in a blue emission peaking at &#955;em=422&#8197;nm.

         <title>Poly(Ferrocenylene Iminoborane) and the Merging of 1,1&#8217;&#8208;Ferrocenylene with p&#8208;Phenylene Iminoborane Building Blocks into Alternating Copolymers, Oligomers, and Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting from well&#8208;known poly&#8208;p&#8208;phenylene vinylene, via poly&#8208;p&#8208;phenylene iminoborane, a new class of hybrid materials was introduced and investigated in this study. 1,1&#8217;&#8208;Ferrocenylene and p&#8208;phenylene were combined in all possible ways to form a series of iminoborane oligomers, polymers, and macrocycles.







Abstract
The combination of redox&#8208;active ferrocene moieties, conjugated B=N units, and p&#8208;phenylene building blocks in linearly concatenated architectural arrangements has been explored. Oligo&#8208; and poly(ferrocenylene iminoborane)s have been successfully prepared, whereby in the latter case, the formation of linear polymers vs. discrete molecular macrocycles could be largely influenced by the polymerization conditions applied. In addition, a series of well&#8208;defined co&#8208;oligomers composed of ferrocenylene and p&#8208;phenylene moieties bridged by one or two B=N units in all possible combinations have been prepared, many of which have been structurally characterized using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Pendent triisopropylphenyl groups on boron provide pronounced kinetic stabilization. Polycondensation of complementary monomers gave copolymers comprising alternating ferrocenylene and p&#8208;phenylene iminoborane building blocks, which were found to be cyclic in nature. UV&#8208;vis absorption spectroscopic and electrochemical studies provided highly valuable insights into the interaction of the different moieties over the B=N bonds, particularly, the electronic communication between the electroactive ferrocene units.

         <title>Optimization of Catalytic Soot Oxidation by 3DOM Perovskite&#8208;Type La0.5&#8208;xKxSr0.5CoO3&#8208;&#948; Catalysts: Structural Insights and K Substitution</title>

3DOM La0.5&#8208;xKxSr0.5CoO3&#8208;&#948; catalysts possess a highly ordered macroporous structure with interconnected pores, facilitating diffusion of soot particles and enhancing contact efficiency with active sites. The enhancement in intrinsic activity is primarily attributed to the electron&#8208;donating effect of K ions which maintains charge conservation and consequently increases concentration of surface oxygen vacancies, leading to the formation of abundant active oxygen species.







Abstract
A series of 3DOM La0.5&#8208;xKxSr0.5CoO3&#8208;&#948; catalysts were synthesized using colloidal crystal templating and citric acid complexation methods. The substitution of K ions for A&#8208;site La ions was found to markedly enhance the catalysts&#8217; intrinsic activity, with the La0.4K0.1Sr0.5CoO3&#8208;&#948; catalyst showing exceptional performance comparable to commercial precious metal catalysts. The La0.4K0.1Sr0.5CoO3&#8208;&#948; catalyst demonstrated the highest catalytic activity, with T10, T50, and T90 values of 280&#8201;&#176;C, 335&#8201;&#176;C, and 387&#8201;&#176;C, respectively. The enhancement in intrinsic activity is primarily attributed to the electron&#8208;donating effect of K ions which maintains charge conservation and consequently increases the concentration of surface oxygen vacancies, leading to the formation of abundant active oxygen species. Additionally, the catalysts exhibited a highly ordered macroporous structure with interconnected pores, facilitating the diffusion of soot particles and enhancing contact efficiency with active sites. These findings not only advance the understanding of the structure&#8208;performance relationship in perovskite catalysts but also pave the way for the development of cost&#8208;effective catalysts for low&#8208;temperature soot abatement.

         <title>The Diverse Reactivity of an Al(I) Carbenoid Towards Phosphorus&#8208;Based Ylides. The Crucial Role of Co&#8208;Crystallised Lithium Halide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions of an Al(I) compound NacNacAl with Wittig reagents results in diverse reactivity, including deprotonation of the NacNac backbone, sp2C&#8722;H activation in the Ph3P moiety, and C&#8722;C coupling and fragmentation of the NacNac ligand.







Abstract
Attempts to generate NacNacAl&#8208;based (NacNac=[ArNC(Me)CHC(Me)NAr]&#8722;; Ar=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) alkylidenes via reactions with trimethyl(methylidene), triphenyl(methylidene) and triethyl(ethylidene) phosphiranes led to new and unexpected reactivity patterns. Reaction with Me3P=CH2 resulted in the intermolecular deprotonation of the NacNac &#8722;CCH3 backbone. Reaction with Ph3P=CH2*LiI afforded an equimolar mixture of NacNacAlH2 and the ortho&#8208;metalated adduct, NacNac'Al(&#951;(C,C)2&#8722;CH2=PPh2(o&#8208;C6H4)) (NacNac&#8217;=[ArNC(Me)CHC(=CH2)NAr]2&#8722;). Finally, the use of Et3P=CHMe*LiBr resulted in the fragmentation of the NacNac moiety.

         <title>Metal Exchange in Thioguanosine Coordination Polymers of Gold (I) and Silver (I)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold(I) and silver (I) ions react with 6&#8208;thioguanosine to form helical coordination polymers with metal&#8208;sulfur chains. These polymers have a helical structure and show strong circular dichroism and photoluminescence. Mixtures of metal ions result in heterometallic coordination polymers. Further, mixtures of homopolymers will exchange metal ions over about 5 h to produce the corresponding heterometallic polymer at equilibrium.

The Ag homopolymer has previously been shown to form left&#8208;hand helices. Intermediate compositions have more complex structures because of the competition between the left and right&#8208;handed preferences of the homopolymers. Finally, we have shown that the metal&#8208;ligand bonds are labile on a timescale of about 5&#8197;h at ambient temperature (about 293&#8197;K).

         <title>Visualization of Ferroptosis&#8208;Induced Lipid Peroxidation Using Plasma Membrane&#8208;Specific Fluorescent Probe LipoxPM</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel fluorescent probe, LipoxPM, can selectively accumulate in the plasma membrane and visualize lipid peroxidation with ratiometric readout. The probe demonstrated that the plasma membrane is one of the targets for lipid peroxidation in ferroptosis process.







Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play essential roles in cellular processes, but aberrant generation of ROS can damage lipids, proteins, and DNA leading to pathological events such as aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are especially susceptible to such oxidative stress. This ROS&#8208;induced lipid peroxidation is a key process of ferroptosis, an iron&#8208;dependent, non&#8208;apoptotic form of cell death. Although lipid peroxidation is an essential event in ferroptosis, current study tools for detecting the oxidation process lack specificity toward a particular membrane type such as plasma membrane. In this study, we present LipoxPM, a novel fluorescent probe that targets lipid peroxidation specifically in plasma membrane over other cellular membranes. LipoxPM features a BODIPY&#8208;based fluorophore and an anionic sulfonate group, enhancing selective accumulation in the plasma membrane. LipoxPM was able to detect ferroptosis&#8208;related lipid peroxidation in live cells, visualizing the spatial distribution of lipid peroxidation in the cell death processes. This probe would enable study of unknown mechanisms of ferroptosis and could potentially facilitate development of therapeutic strategies targeting oxidative stress&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Peripheral Modification Strategy of Heavy Atom for High&#8208;Performance Multi&#8208;Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two MR&#8208;TADF emitters, BNDBT and BNDBF, in which the dibenzothiophene and dibenzofuran substituents are attached at the bottom of the B/N frameworks are developed. The non&#8208;sensitized green OLED based on BNDBT emitter displays good performance with EQEmax of 35.5&#8201;% and EQEs of 28.0&#8201;%/16.0&#8201;% at the brightness of 100 and 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.







Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting materials with multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) have shown great potential for realizing highly efficient narrowband organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, the heavy efficiency roll&#8208;off caused by the slow reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process remains a challenging issue for the further practical application of MR&#8208;TADF materials. Here, we develop two TADF emitters, BNDBT and BNDBF, in which the dibenzothiophene and dibenzofuran substituents are attached at the bottom of the B/N frameworks. They all exhibit the similar high photoluminescence quantum yields of 90&#8201;% and 87&#8201;%. The sulfur&#8208;containing material BNDBT exhibits a RISC rate (kRISC) of 6.02&#215;104&#8197;s&#8722;1, which is three&#8208;folded higher than BNDBF (2.09&#215;104&#8197;s&#8722;1) without heavy atom. The corresponding green OLED based on BNDBT exhibits an improved external quantum efficiency of 35.5&#8201;% and lower efficiency roll&#8208;offs at high brightnesses of 100&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 and 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, respectively. In addition, the BNDBT&#8208;based OLED maintains high color purity without causing a sharp increase in FWHM as compared with that of BNDBF. This work indicates that introducing the heavy atom at the bottom of the B/N skeleton is an effective strategy to enhance kRISC while maintaining narrow FWHM, thereby achieving high&#8208;performance MR&#8208;TADF emitters.

&lt;p&gt;Two MR-TADF emitters, BNDBT and BNDBF, in which the dibenzothiophene and dibenzofuran substituents are attached at the bottom of the B/N frameworks are developed. The non-sensitized green OLED based on BNDBT emitter displays good performance with EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of 35.5&#8201;% and EQEs of 28.0&#8201;%/16.0&#8201;% at the brightness of 100 and 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic light-emitting materials with multi-resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR-TADF) have shown great potential for realizing highly efficient narrowband organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, the heavy efficiency roll-off caused by the slow reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process remains a challenging issue for the further practical application of MR-TADF materials. Here, we develop two TADF emitters, BNDBT and BNDBF, in which the dibenzothiophene and dibenzofuran substituents are attached at the bottom of the B/N frameworks. They all exhibit the similar high photoluminescence quantum yields of 90&#8201;% and 87&#8201;%. The sulfur-containing material BNDBT exhibits a RISC rate (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;RISC&lt;/sub&gt;) of 6.02&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is three-folded higher than BNDBF (2.09&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) without heavy atom. The corresponding green OLED based on BNDBT exhibits an improved external quantum efficiency of 35.5&#8201;% and lower efficiency roll-offs at high brightnesses of 100&#8197;cd&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. In addition, the BNDBT-based OLED maintains high color purity without causing a sharp increase in FWHM as compared with that of BNDBF. This work indicates that introducing the heavy atom at the bottom of the B/N skeleton is an effective strategy to enhance &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;RISC&lt;/sub&gt; while maintaining narrow FWHM, thereby achieving high-performance MR-TADF emitters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Stable Polyoxovanadate&#8208;based Metal&#8722;organic Framework Containing Dual Catalytic Sites for Efficient Synthesis of p&#8211;benzoquinones</title>

The polyoxovanadate&#8208;based metal&#8722;organic framework with dual&#8208;active centers catalyzes the oxidation of substituted phenols to synthesize functionalized p&#8208;benzoquinones efficiently and maintains excellent catalytic performance.







Abstract
A novel polyoxovanadate&#8208;based metal&#8722;organic framework (POV&#8208;MOF), [Cu(bix)]{V2O6} (V&#8211;Cu&#8208;MOF, bix=1,4&#8208;bis(imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;ylmethyl)benzene), has been successfully synthesized and characterized. The V&#8211;Cu&#8208;MOF demonstrates exceptional performance in the selective oxidation of 2,3,6&#8208;trimethylphenol to 2,3,5&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone within just 10 minutes under mild conditions using hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant. The V&#8211;Cu&#8208;MOF exhibits remarkable versatility, efficiently oxidizing various substituted phenols while maintaining high catalytic activity. Additionally, it shows excellent recyclability, with conversion and selectivity consistently exceeding 97&#8201;% after multiple cycles. Mechanistic studies reveal that the reaction benefits from dual&#8208;active centers {V2O6}2&#8722; clusters and binuclear copper units. The weak substrate adsorption by binuclear copper prevents catalyst poisoning, ensuring sustained activity throughout the process.

         <title>Homochiral Carboxylate&#8208;Anchored Truxene Tripods: Design, Synthesis, and Monolayer Formation on Ag(111)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stimulated by the renewed interest in chirality&#8208;based optical and electronic properties of molecules, a chiral truxene&#8208;based molecular tripod, namely truxene trisacetic acid (TTA), was newly synthesized and chirally resolved. A systematic study using synchrotron&#8208;based spectroscopic techniques and scanning tunneling microscopy revealed that homochiral TTA forms a densely packed and ordered monolayer on the Ag(111) surface.







Abstract
The design of well&#8208;defined assemblies of chiral molecules is a prerequisite for numerous applications, such as chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS). In this context, tripodal molecular films bear the advantage of better control of molecular orientation and alignment than analogous monopodal systems. To this end, we report on the synthesis and assembly property of C3 chiral syn&#8208;5,10,15&#8208;truxene triacetic acid. (S,S,S) and (R,R,R) enantiomers were isolated and adsorbed on underpotential deposited Ag(111)/Au/mica both individually and as a racemate. The enantiomers form a densely packed and well&#8208;ordered structure (including the azimuthal alignment), even though with small sizes of individual domains. The molecules adsorb predominantly in tripodal configuration, with all three docking groups bound to the substrate as carboxylates in a bidentate fashion. The truxene backbone is then oriented parallel to the substrate surface but the fluorene blades are twisted to some extent. The racemate monolayer turned out to be less densely packed and less well&#8208;ordered compared to the films of individual enantiomers, which underlines the fact that uniform chirality is primarily important for molecular ordering of the truxenes. We hope that the designed system will be useful in the context of CISS and stimulate further activities regarding chiral tripods.

         <title>Enzymatic Synthesis of Saturated Bioisosteres of Ortho&#8208;Substituted Benzenes by Artificial Photoenzyme</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthesis of saturated bioisosteres of ortho&#8208;disubstituted benzenes was reported by the artificial photoenzyme harboring a genetic incorporated photosensor under the light with several examples after the directed evolution. Our work provides a biocatalytic strategy for the synthesis of saturated bioisosteres of ortho&#8208;disubstituted benzenes and expands the utility of artificial photoenzyme for abiological reactions.







Abstract
Saturated bioisosteres of ortho&#8208;substituted benzenes are of significant interest due to their enhanced pharmacokinetic properties, such as improved metabolic stability and reduced toxicity, making them valuable in drug design and development. However, efficient synthesis of them remains a challenge in organic chemistry. Herein, we report the biocatalytic synthesis of saturated bioisosteres of ortho&#8208;substituted benzenes using engineered artificial photoenzymes. The artificial photoenzyme, incorporating genetically encoded unnatural amino acids with benzophenone photosensitizer residue, facilitate the formation of chiral saturated bioisosteres with moderate enantiomeric excess via the energy transfer process. Our results demonstrate the versatility of artificial photoenzymes in mediating new&#8208;to&#8208;nature reactions that are difficult to achieve with conventional chemical or enzymatic methods.

An efficient strategy with Fe(NO3)3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;9H2O and TEMPO as catalysts and oxygen as green oxidant, PMB ethers could be converted to aldehydes or ketones under very mild conditions.

Abstract
An efficient and highly selective aerobic oxidation of p&#8208;methoxybenzyl ethers to aldehydes or ketones with Fe(NO3)3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;9H2O and TEMPO as catalysts at 25&#8201;&#176;C has been developed. This method is compatible with versatile functional groups: adamantyl, ether, alkynyl, and alkenyl, etc. Due to the mild nature of the reaction conditions, even the highly sensitive optically active aldehydes with an easily racemized &#945;&#8208;chiral center could be formed from optically active PMB ethers without racemization. Other protecting groups of hydroxyl group remained intact during the current aerobic oxidation. The catalytic protocol has been successfully applied to synthesis of (R)&#8208;tert&#8208;butyldimethylsilyl hept&#8208;1&#8208;en&#8208;6&#8208;yn&#8208;4&#8208;yl ether, which is the key intermediate for the total synthesis of natural product, (&#8722;)&#8208;6&#8208;O&#8208;methylcitreoisocoumarin.

         <title>Convenient Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;acyl Glycosides and its Application in the Synthesis of Scleropentaside A, Scleropentaside B and the Derivatives of Dapagliflozin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C&#8208;Glycosides are a common feature in numerous bioactive natural compounds and play a crucial role as mimics of O/N&#8208;glycosides. Our process for synthesizing &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;acyl glycosides involves a reductive cross&#8208;coupling of protected glycosyl bromides with the corresponding carboxylic acid, followed by base&#8208;assisted deprotection and isomerization. This method is compatible with diverse glycosyl donors, including disaccharides. Consequently, we achieved the total synthesis of the natural products scleropentaside A and scleropentaside B with exceptional efficiency. These &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;acyl glycosides can be readily transformed into novel forms of C&#8208;glycosides capable of disrupting signaling pathways linked to various pathological conditions, such as diabetes.</dc:description>

         <title>New Cytotoxic Derivatives by the Phosphorylation and Phosphinoylation of Diethyl &#945;&#8208;Amino&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Aryl&#8208;methylphosphonates</title>

         <dc:description>In order to make available new derivatives, diethyl &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;methylphosphonates were subjected to phosphorylation, phosphinoylation and even thiophosphinoylation by reaction with phosphoryl chlorides, diphenylphosphinoyl chloride, and with the mixture of diphenylchlorophosphine and elemental sulfur, respectively. The X&#8208;ray crystal structures of the diphenylphosphinoyl and the diphenylthiophosphinoyl derivatives revealed molecular and supramolecular similarities, as well as a few differences too. An essential conformation change, along with packing differences are attributable to a change of one heteroatom: an oxygen for a sulfur in one of the P=X function. The diethyl diethylphosphoryl&#8208;aminobenzylphosphonates showed the highest antiproliferative effects on multiple myeloma cells, while the thiophosphinoylated diethyl aminobenzylphosphonate was the most effective on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The treatment of pnictinidenes [2&#8208;(RNHCH2)&#8208;6&#8208;(RN=CH)C6H3]E (1As/Sb) (where E = As or Sb) with benzoyl peroxide provided compounds [2&#8208;(DippNCH2)&#8208;6&#8208;(DippN=CH)C6H3]E(O2CPh) (2As/Sb) as a result of two step procedure, i.e. oxidation of the pnictogen centre followed by the elimination of benzoic acid. The reaction between 1As and diphenyl disulfide proceeded in the same vein yielding thiophenol and [2&#8208;(DippNCH2)&#8208;6&#8208;(DippN=CH)C6H3]As(SPh) (3As). Analogous reaction of 1Sb furnished a mixture of [2&#8208;(DippNHCH2)&#8208;6&#8208;(DippN=CH)C6H3]Sb(SPh)2 (3&#180;Sb), [2&#8208;(DippNCH2)&#8208;6&#8208;(DippN=CH)C6H3]Sb(SPh) (3Sb) and PhSH, while NMR studies proved the existence of a dynamic equilibrium between all three compounds in solution and removal of incipient PhSH was necessary for the isolation of 3Sb. Both 1As/Sb smoothly reacted with 2&#8208;nitrosotoluene leading to [2&#8208;(DippNCH2)&#8208;6&#8208;(DippN=CH)C6H3]E(O&#8208;NH&#8208;2&#8208;Me&#8208;Ph) 4As/Sb and with 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazoline&#8208;3,5&#8208;dione giving [2&#8208;(DippNCH2)&#8208;6&#8208;(DippN=CH)C6H3]E[(N(CO)&#8208;NH(CO))N&#8208;Ph] 5As/Sb. All compounds were characterized by IR, Raman, NMR spectroscopy, and the molecular structures, except for 3As and 5Sb, were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Furthermore, we scrutinized the thermally induced reductive elimination of benzoic acid and thiophenol from 2&#8208;3As/Sb, respectively, and that of 4&#8208;phenylurazole from 5As. These eliminations involve C&#8208;H activation at the CH2N group, and the recovery of the pnictinidene center in [2,6&#8208;(RN=CH)2C6H3]E (6As/Sb). Using DFT calculations a plausible mechanism was suggested for all&#160;investigated reactions, which are in good agreement with the experimental observations.</dc:description>

         <title>Base&#8208;Promoted Homolytic Aromatic Substitution (BHAS) Reactions and Hydrodehalogenations Driven by Green Light and an Iron(III)&#8208;NHC Photoredox Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An Fe(III)&#8208;NHC complex has been employed for the green light driven catalysis of base&#8208;promoted homolytic aromatic substitution (BHAS) reactions. Tributylamine was used as a sacrificial electron donor, together with a potassium carbonate base in dimethyl sulfoxide as solvent. In contrast to previously studied photocatalysts, the excited Fe(III)&#8208;NHC complex is not reducing the arylhalide substrates. Instead, the latter are activated by &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals formed upon reductive quenching of the photocatalyst by tributylamine. Avoiding strongly reducing photocatalysts as well as strong base, these mild reaction conditions allowed for the expansion of the substrate scope to accommodate also aldehyde and ester substituents. 100% conversion was obtained after 48 hrs of irradiation. In this way a wide variety of cyclized products and their corresponding hydrodehalogenated products were obtained as isolated and pure compounds, in the vast majority of cases.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced hydrogen evolution catalyzed by Co(II) complexes of N5&#8208;donor ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three new cobalt complexes of the general formula [Co(II)(L)(CH3CN) ]2+, where L is one of three pentadentate nitrogen&#8208;donor ligands based on the N4Py framework, have been synthesized and characterized. The capacity of the three complexes to effect photocatalytic proton reduction has been examined. Their photocatalytic activities in the presence of [Ru(bpy)3]2+, acting as a photosensitizer, and ascorbic acid, acting as a sacrificial electron donor, were screened in a water/acetonitrile mixture. The photochemical mechanism, as revealed by nanosecond time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy, involves reaction of the excited sensitizer with ascorbic acid to yield [Ru(bpy)3]+ as a primary photogenerated reductant, capable of electron transfer to the cobalt catalyst(s). Under the experimental conditions used, partial decomposition of both the sensitizer and the catalyst is the main deactivation channel for photocatalysis. Optimization of reaction conditions indicated that the use of more reducing iridium or copper&#8208;based photosensitizers had a beneficial effect on the catalytic performance. The effect of the different ligands on the catalytic activities of the corresponding cobalt complexes have been investigated by DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>OXIDATION&#8208;DEFORMYLATION CASCADE CATALYZED BY A MONONUCLEAR COPPER COMPLEX</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, two copper complexes were synthesized using N3 (arising from two pyridines and one amide group) containing ligands N&#8208;(2&#8208;picolyl)picolinamide (L1H) and bis(2&#8208;pyridylcarbonyl)amine (L2H), forming [(L1)CuII(OH2)(NO3)] (1) and [(L2)CuII(OH2)2](NO3) (2). The reaction of complex&#160;1&#160;with hydrogen peroxide in alcoholic solvents yielded a formate&#8208;bound complex. Studies with isotopically labeled&#160;13C ethanol indicated that formate originates from the C1 of ethanol after C&#8208;C bond cleavage. Complex&#160;1&#160;was found to catalytically convert primary alcohols into formic acid probably following a two&#8208;step process: (i) alcohol oxidation to aldehyde and (ii) aldehyde deformylation. Further experiments with 2&#8208;phenylpropionaldehyde (2&#8208;PPA) confirm the ability of complex&#160;1&#160;to catalyze aldehyde deformylation.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this study, two copper complexes were synthesized using N3 (arising from two pyridines and one amide group) containing ligands N-(2-picolyl)picolinamide (L1H) and bis(2-pyridylcarbonyl)amine (L2H), forming [(L1)CuII(OH2)(NO3)] (1) and [(L2)CuII(OH2)2](NO3) (2). The reaction of complex&#160;1&#160;with hydrogen peroxide in alcoholic solvents yielded a formate-bound complex. Studies with isotopically labeled&#160;13C ethanol indicated that formate originates from the C1 of ethanol after C-C bond cleavage. Complex&#160;1&#160;was found to catalytically convert primary alcohols into formic acid probably following a two-step process: (i) alcohol oxidation to aldehyde and (ii) aldehyde deformylation. Further experiments with 2-phenylpropionaldehyde (2-PPA) confirm the ability of complex&#160;1&#160;to catalyze aldehyde deformylation. Both steps of the reaction are associated with significant kinetic deuterium isotope effects (KDIE), suggesting that hydrogen atom abstractions (HAA) occur during the rate-determining steps of both conversions. Overall, this system proposes a clean catalytic process for alcohol-to-formic acid conversion, operating under mild conditions, and offering potential synthetic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Technetium and Rhenium Auto&#8208;reduction, Polymerization and Lability towards Group VII Polyoxometalate Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Group VII Tc and Re have long been studied to develop both radiopharmaceuticals and technologies for nuclear materials management. Fundamental research has targeted understanding this periodic table crossroads where polyoxometalates meets metal&#8208;metal bonded complexes. Here we have isolated green hygroscopic and metastable crystals of (ReVI,oct)2(ReVII,tet)2(OH)2(O)12&#183;H2O (ReVI,VII&#8208;green,tet=tetrahedral, oct=octahedral), determined by single&#8208;crystal x&#8208;ray diffraction. In addition to color, Re&#8208;L1 X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge spectroscopy confirms the reduced oxidation state. ReVI,VII&#8208;green provides the first demonstration of Re autoreduction, long&#8208;observed for Mn and Tc. We also isolated and structurally characterized [Tc4O4(H2O)2(ReO4)14]2&#8208; (Tc4Re14) polyanion crystals that contain Tc(V) and Re(VII), consistent with greater stability of reduced Tc compared to reduced Re. Small angle X&#8208;ray scattering of both compounds and prior&#8208;reported polyanion [Tc4O4(H2O)2(TcO4)14]4&#8208; (Tc20) dissolved in acetonitrile indicated a qualitative lability order of oxo&#8208;linkages of Re&#8208;O&#8208;Re &gt; Re&#8208;O&#8208;Tc &gt;Tc&#8208;O&#8208;Tc, and lability of Tc20 was also probed by 99Tc nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Computation provided insight into 99Tc chemical shifts as well as lability. Based on both reducibility and solution phase dynamics of polynuclear compounds investigated here, Re is an imperfect surrogate for Tc, and further expansion of group VII polyoxometalate chemistry seems promising.</dc:description>

         <title>The Lewis Acidity of Bare and Crown Ether&#8208;Complexed Germanium(II) and Tin(II) Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Gutmann&#8208;Beckett and Fluoride Ion Affinity methods were used to assess the Lewis acidity of a variety of dicationic germanium(II) and tin(II) crown ether complexes and the corresponding neutral halides. The coordination of two or more equivalents of triethylphosphine oxide (TEPO) was observed which was accompanied by full or partial replacement of the crown ether or chloride ligands from the metal centre illustrating the importance of unambiguously identifying the species in solution to enable a meaningful discussion of relative Lewis acidities. From the coordination complexes observed, the germanium(II) centre was found, in general, to be more Lewis acidic than the tin(II) centre. The crown ether ligands, when retained, had little influence on the Lewis acidity of the complex and may, for ease of synthesis, be used as convenient precursors to &#8220;bare&#8221; Ge(II) and Sn(II) dicationic catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Zirconium(IV)&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrosilylation of Organic Carbonates and Polycarbonates Household Wastes into Alcohol Derivatives[]
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A variety of organic carbonates have been catalytically reduced by the Schwartz reagent Cp2Zr(H)Cl in presence of the reductant MeSi(OMe)2H to the corresponding sylilated diol derivatives in excellent yield and selectivity. The method can be transposed to the depolymerisation of pure polycarbonates or derived from household wastes. Experimental investigations afforded information on the mechanism at play.







Abstract
The Schwartz's reagent Cp2Zr(H)Cl is a well known stoichiometric reagent for the reduction of unsaturated organic molecules but it has rarely been used in catalytic transformations. Herein, we describe the reduction of a variety of organic carbonates using the catalyst Cp2Zr(H)Cl in combination with Me(MeO)2SiH (DMMS) as reductant. This method was further applied to the reductive depolymerization of some polycarbonate materials and yielded silylated alcohols and diols in mild conditions. This method for the recycling polycarbonates is characterized by its stability to the additives contained in household plastics as well as its ability to selectively depolymerize the polycarbonate PC&#8208;BPA when mixed with the polyester PET. Experimental investigations brought evidences on a mechanism based on the succession of a three steps sequence comprising the hydrozirconation of the carbonyl fragment, thermal &#963; C&#8722;O bond cleavage, and an ultimate Zr&#8722;OR/Si&#8722;H &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis reaction to regenerate the hydride catalyst.

         <title>Ultrafast Photoinduced Electron Transfer Between Donor (Eosin&#8208;Y) and Acceptor (Naphthoquinone) in a Supramolecular Array Based on a Coordination Cage Host</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Outside to inside: a coordination cage with distinct surface&#8208;binding and cavity&#8208;binding sites can bind two different guest types using orthogonal interactions, allowing for photoinduced electron transfer to occur between guests across the cage surface on a 1&#8197;ps timescale.







Abstract
An octanuclear M8L12 coordination cage host (HPEG&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;M) in aqueous solution binds neutral electron&#8208;accepting guests such as naphthoquinone (NQ) in its central cavity via the hydrophobic effect, and multiple anionic photosensitisers such as Eosin&#8208;Y (EY2&#8722;) around the exterior surface due to 16+ charge on the complex cation: this is confirmed by both solution titration experiments and X&#8208;ray crystallography. In the three&#8208;component assembly HPEG&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Cd/EY2&#8722;/NQ, photoexcitation of EY2&#8722; at 525&#8197;nm results in ultrafast (ca. 1&#8197;ps) photoinduced EY2&#8722;&#8594;NQ electron transfer from surface&#8208;bound EY2&#8722; to cavity&#8208;bound NQ (which have been brought into close proximity by their interactions with different sites on the host cage) to give the charge&#8208;separated pair EY&#8901;&#8722;/NQ&#8901;&#8722;, identified by transient absorption spectroscopy: back&#8208;ET results in charge recombination in &#8776;70&#8197;ps. The assembly of donor and acceptor components via orthogonal interactions using the host cage as a scaffold presents a promising route into spatial control of multiple components in supramolecular arrays for photophysical applications.

     alt="Ultrafast Photoinduced Electron Transfer Between Donor (Eosin-Y) and Acceptor (Naphthoquinone) in a Supramolecular Array Based on a Coordination Cage Host"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside to inside: a coordination cage with distinct surface-binding and cavity-binding sites can bind two different guest types using orthogonal interactions, allowing for photoinduced electron transfer to occur between guests across the cage surface on a 1&#8197;ps timescale.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An octanuclear M&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; coordination cage host (&lt;b&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;PEG&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;&lt;b&gt;&#8901;&#8201;M&lt;/b&gt;) in aqueous solution binds neutral electron-accepting guests such as naphthoquinone (&lt;b&gt;NQ&lt;/b&gt;) in its central cavity &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; the hydrophobic effect, and multiple anionic photosensitisers such as Eosin-Y (&lt;b&gt;EY&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;) around the exterior surface due to 16+ charge on the complex cation: this is confirmed by both solution titration experiments and X-ray crystallography. In the three-component assembly &lt;b&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;PEG&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;&lt;b&gt;&#8901;&#8201;Cd/EY&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;b&gt;/NQ&lt;/b&gt;, photoexcitation of &lt;b&gt;EY&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; at 525&#8197;nm results in ultrafast (&lt;i&gt;ca&lt;/i&gt;. 1&#8197;ps) photoinduced &lt;b&gt;EY&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#8594;NQ&lt;/b&gt; electron transfer from surface-bound &lt;b&gt;EY&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to cavity-bound &lt;b&gt;NQ&lt;/b&gt; (which have been brought into close proximity by their interactions with different sites on the host cage) to give the charge-separated pair &lt;b&gt;EY&lt;/b&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;b&gt;/NQ&lt;/b&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, identified by transient absorption spectroscopy: back-ET results in charge recombination in &#8776;70&#8197;ps. The assembly of donor and acceptor components &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; orthogonal interactions using the host cage as a scaffold presents a promising route into spatial control of multiple components in supramolecular arrays for photophysical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Syntheses of Carbazoles by Photosensitized Electrocyclization of Triarylamines. Effect of Inductive Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Groups on the Photocyclization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The acetone&#8208;photosensitized irradiation of mono&#8208; and di&#8208;substituted triarylamines effectively affords the respective carbazoles in high yields. Particularly noticeable are triarylamines substituted with inductive electron withdrawing groups (Cl, CnF2n+1), which afford almost exclusively endo carbazoles. Mechanistic investigations and in&#8208;silico studies rationalize this tendency.







Abstract
The acetone&#8208;sensitized [6&#960;]&#8208;electrocyclization of unsubstituted, mono&#8208;, and disubstituted triarylamines (TAAs: substituents H, CH&#8323;, CH&#8323;O, Cl, CnF&#8322;n+1; n=1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10) under 310&#8197;nm light led to the formation of endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;carbazoles in high yields; particularly, TAAs substituted with inductive electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (Cl, CnF2n+1) exhibit remarkable endo&#8208;selectivity towards cyclization. For TAAs substituted with both inductive electron&#8208; withdrawing and donating groups, the photocyclization towards endo carbazoles is dictated by the presence of the electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. Chemical yields (%), quantum yields of conversion (&#966;R), apparent cyclization rate constants (kcyc), and Hammett plots correlations are illustrated for all substituted TAAs in acetone. Photophysical studies reveal that TAAs substituted with resonance electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (OAc, NO2, CHO) do not undergo electrocyclization in acetone at 310&#8197;nm due to formation of charge&#8208;transfer states that vastly deactivate the triplet reactive manifold, paralleling the behavior observed in MeCN as solvent. Absorption and emission spectra, Stokes shifts, and singlet excited state energies are illustrated for substituted TAAs and carbazoles. In&#8208;silico studies support the high stereoselectivity observed for the preferred endo&#8208; photosensitized [6&#960;]&#8208;electrocyclization of Cl&#8208; and perfluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted TAAs.

         <title>Embedding Coupled Pd/Fe Sites in Electrospun MOF&#8208;Derived Carbon Nanofibers Achieves Efficient and Durable Oxygen Reduction Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Pd&#8722;Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C nanofiber catalyst, synthesized by electrospinning and metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) pyrolysis, features highly dispersed Pd/Fe sites in nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon. The incorporation of Pd enhances structural stability, strong Pd&#8722;Fe interaction reduces overpotential and promotes intermediate conversion. It achieves a 0.953&#8197;V half&#8208;wave potential, with only 1&#8197;mV loss after 10,000&#8197;cycles, demonstrating great oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and stability.







Abstract
High costs, poor durability of Pt electrocatalysts, and the low performance of non&#8208;precious metals hinder the large&#8208;scale commercialization of fuel cells. To address these challenges, a bimetallic, highly dispersed catalyst containing Pd and Fe uniformly distributed on porous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanofibers was developed. This catalyst demonstrated remarkable oxygen reduction catalytic performance. The Pd&#8722;Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst exhibited catalytic activity 4.6 times higher than that of the JM 20&#8201;% Pt/C catalyst, despite containing only 0.62&#8197;wt.&#8201;% Pd. Moreover, it achieved a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2=0.953&#8197;V vs. RHE) that is 40&#8197;mV higher than the JM 20&#8201;% Pt/C catalyst (0.913&#8197;V vs. RHE). Significantly, with a total metal content of just 1.19&#8197;wt.&#8201;%, the E1/2 of Pd&#8722;Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst decreased by only 1&#8197;mV after 10,000&#8197;cycles, highlighting its exceptional durability. Furthermore, a stability test revealed a current retention rate of 84.87&#8201;% after 50,000&#8197;s of operation, with no evidence of agglomeration. These results suggest that combining electrostatic spinning of MOFs with pyrolysis provides an effective and innovative method for synthesizing electrocatalysts with reduced reliance on precious metals.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Functional Synthetic Linear and Cyclic Peptides with Anti&#8208;Amyloid and Antimicrobial Activities for Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presented two strategies to aid in the discovery of synthetic peptide inhibitors with anti&#8208;amyloid and antimicrobial activities for Alzheimer's disease. Four synthetic peptides were identified, including the shortest linear peptide and two cyclic peptides with simple structures.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;functional peptides exhibiting both anti&#8208;amyloid and antimicrobial activities have attracted attention as promising candidates for Alzheimer's disease treatment. The advantage of these peptides lies in their ability to simultaneously target both the amyloid cascade hypothesis and the microbial infection hypothesis, in contrast to single&#8208;function inhibitors. However, most of the reported dual&#8208;functional peptides to date are natural peptides, and the development of synthetic peptides in this area remains limited. In this study, we propose two strategies to aid in the discovery of synthetic dual&#8208;functional peptides. We then report four distinct synthetic dual&#8208;functional peptides identified using these strategies, with the A&#946;1&#8211;40/A&#946;1&#8211;42 fibrillation system and common bacterial strains serving as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept platform. One strategy involves repurposing existing knowledge, while the other breaks from established conventions. Using the first strategy, we discovered a very short dual&#8208;functional linear peptide. With the second strategy, we identified a simple dual&#8208;functional cyclic peptide. Furthermore, by combining these two strategies, we developed a hybrid dual&#8208;functional peptide incorporating both linear and cyclic structures. We hope that our findings will contribute to the future discovery of more synthetic dual&#8208;functional peptides for treating Alzheimer's disease.

         <title>Rational construction of a pyrimido[2,1&#8208;b]benzothiazole&#8208;based photoswitchable smart AIE material: A theoretical insight into fluorescence switching mechanism of the chimeric dyad</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Currently, AIEgen&#8208;photochromics conjugates and intrinsic photochromic AIEgens are the two major molecular design strategies for photoresponsive AIE materials. However, these two strategies still have their own limitations. In our previous research, we discovered pyrimido[2,1&#8208;b][1,3]benzothiazole (PBT) as a novel core structure of AIEgens. We herein explored a chimeric strategy to rationally integrate photochromic bisthienylethene (BTE) as the orthogonal head group into a new PBT molecule (PBTE). Compared to the conventional design strategies, the compact chimeric design of PBTE not only well maintains the AIE and photochromic properties of the parent fragments but also leads to excellent AIE&#8208;photoswitching capability in both films and single crystals. Theoretical calculations revealed that MO energy level arrangement of PBTE reorganized upon photoisomerization and the fast vibrational relaxation (VR) along with internal conversion (IC) from S5 to S1 state may serve as a competitive channel for the fluorescence quenching of PBTE&#8208;c. Comparison of the kinetics of the nonradiative decay with those of the excited&#8208;state energy transfer (EET) processes clearly showed that the ultrafast intramolecular F&#1255;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is the dominant cause of fluorescence&#8208;off state. The applications of PBTE in erasable optical memory material and multi&#8208;dimensional anti&#8208;counterfeiting have also been demonstrated.</dc:description>

Theoretical calculations revealed that MO energy level arrangement of PBTE reorganized upon photoisomerization and the fast vibrational relaxation (VR) along with internal conversion (IC) from S5 to S1 state may serve as a competitive channel for the fluorescence quenching of PBTE-c. Comparison of the kinetics of the nonradiative decay with those of the excited-state energy transfer (EET) processes clearly showed that the ultrafast intramolecular F&#1255;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is the dominant cause of fluorescence-off state. The applications of PBTE in erasable optical memory material and multi-dimensional anti-counterfeiting have also been demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Amine&#8208;Imine Tautomeric Excited State Intramolecular Proton Transfer in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Alcohol and Anion Recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three amino functionalized compounds have been synthesized to explore the intramolecular proton transfer in excited state (ESIPT) through amine&#8208;imine tautomerism. These materials exhibit ESIPT based dual emission in water but in presence of small chain alcohols and some strong oxidizing anions, the compounds show a single emission maximum indicating the suppression of ESIPT behavior.







Abstract
To study the amine&#8208;imine tautomeric alteration through excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT), three amine&#8208;functionalized metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been synthesized by using two different metal ions and neutral linkers along with same ESIPT&#8208;enable anionic linker through the slow diffusion process. All the MOFs have 2D structure with asymmetric units of {[Mn(2,6&#8208;dip)(2&#8208;atp)](H2O)(CH3OH)}n (1), {[Mn(3,5&#8208;dip)(2&#8208;atp)](solvent)x}n (2) and {Zn2(3,5&#8208;dip)2(2&#8208;atp)(&#956;2&#8208;O2&#8722;)](solvent)x}n (3) (where 2,6&#8208;dip=2,6&#8208;di(1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridine, 3,5&#8208;dip=3,5&#8208;di(1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridine, 2&#8208;atp=2&#8208;amino terephthalic acid). The 2D networks of desolvated form of compound 1, 2, and 3 show water influencing proton transfer for amine&#8208;imine tautomerism in excited state through the ionic interaction with water molecules to the frameworks. However, in case of polar small chain aliphatic alcohols like methanol, ethanol and isopropanol; the compounds do not show any dual emissive ESIPT but exhibit three different intensified single peaks for each of the compounds. This different emission intensity in presence of different alcohols are helpful to detect these alcohols selectively. In addition to that in case of all three compounds, the water assisted&#8208;ESIPT is interrupted by some strong oxidizing agents like CrO42&#8722;, Cr2O72&#8722; and MnO4&#8722; ions. This phenomenon allows the method of detection for the aforesaid oxidizing ions in water by interruption of the dual emissive fluorescence.

         <title>Electronic Interactions in Coulombic Associated Photoactive Macrocycles to Chemically Modified MoS2 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three different nanoensembles interfacing 2H&#8208;MoS2 and Coulombic&#8208;associated Zn&#8208;metalated phthalocyanine, Zn&#8208;metalated porphyrin and a boron dipyrromethene, are described and fully characterized. The three nanoensembles, complementary covering a wide visible absorbance range, are comparatively studied, with a focus on the electronic communication achieved between MoS2 and the respective photoactive molecules, in both the ground and the excited state.







Abstract
Whilst functionalization of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), and more specifically MoS2, has flourished the past decade, the accommodation of photoactive molecules on their lattice has unlocked the potentiality of this family of materials in a series of optoelectronic and energy related applications. The electronic communication between the chromophore and MoS2, in such systems, has been thoroughly studied, in cases where the grafting of the former on the latter is secured through covalent bonding. However, comparatively less attention has been drawn in cases where the chromophore is electrostatically anchored on MoS2, a means that potentially provides alternative ways of spatially accommodating the ligand on the TMD's extended environment, which directly affects the electronic communication between the two entities. In this work, we comparatively study the photophysical characteristics of three separate nanoensembles, where MoS2 is electrostatically hosting a Zn&#8208;phthalocyanine, a Zn&#8208;porphyrin, and a boron&#8208;dipyrromethene, that complementary cover a wide range of visible absorption, via UV&#8208;Vis and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The results highlight the strong interactions in the excited state across all chromophores, while the ground&#8208;state interactions vary from chromophore to chromophore, indicating a distinct energy exchange dependent on the specific nanoensemble.

         <title>Methyl&#8208;&#960; Interactions. Nature of Bonding and Limits of Strength</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
There is growing evidence that the methyl group and the phenyl ring tend to align themselves consistent with the idea of an attractive force between them. DFT calculations determine the strength of this binding and how it is affected by substituents on the two groups. The binding energy is measured to lie between 1 and 5&#8197;kcal/mol, the latter equivalent to a typical H&#8208;bond, e.&#8201;g. between water molecules. The calculations further probe the nature of the interaction and whether it is best characterized as a tetrel bond or a CH&#8901;&#8901;&#960; H&#8208;bond.







Abstract
Both methyl groups and benzene rings are exceedingly common, and they lie near one another in many chemical situations. DFT calculations are used to gauge the strength of the attractive forces between them, and to better understand the phenomena that underlie this attraction. Methane and benzene are taken as the starting point, and substituents of both electron&#8208;withdrawing and donating types are added to each. The interaction energy varies between 1.4 and 5.0&#8197;kcal/mol, depending upon the substituents placed on the two groups. The nature of the binding is analyzed via Atoms in Molecules (AIM), Natural Bond Orbital (NBO), Symmetry&#8208;Adapted Perturbation Theory (SAPT), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shifts, and electron density shift diagrams. While there is a sizable electrostatic component, it is dispersion that dominates these interactions, particularly the weaker ones. As such, these interactions cannot be categorized unambiguously as either H&#8208;bonds or tetrel bonds.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;high specific surface area porous carbon: hierarchical porous carbon material (HPC&#8208;300) was prepared by using polyacrylonitrile as carbon source and potassium hydroxide as activator. The symmetric supercapacitor assembled using HPC&#8208;300 has an energy density of 11.7&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a specific power of 250&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1.







Abstract
The porous structural tailoring of polyacrylonitrile&#8208;based carbon materials is the key to maximize capacitive performance. Herein, hierarchical porous carbons (HPC) with high specific surface area and controllable porosity are synthesized by preoxidation assisted alkali activation strategy using polyacrylonitrile as the precursor. The results show that high preoxidation temperature is beneficial to increase the specific surface area and pore volume of HPC. The optimized HPC&#8208;300 has a high BET specific surface area of 3161&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1, a micropore volume of 1.45&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1, and an AD/AG of 3.56. Electrochemical test shows that the specific capacitances of HPC&#8208;300 in 6&#8197;M KOH electrolyte at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 are 314.1&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 213.0&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively, with a capacitance retention of 67.8&#8201;%. The assembled supercapacitors based on HPC&#8208;300 deliver an energy density of 11.7&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 250.0&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1 in KOH electrolyte and 21.1&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at 450.0&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1 in Na2SO4 electrolyte and possess a capacitance retention of 98.1&#8201;% over 20,000 charge&#8208;discharge cycles. This preoxidation coupled activation method provides a potential strategy for the preparation of PAN&#8208;based porous carbon with high specific surface area and capacitance.

The assembled supercapacitors based on HPC-300 deliver an energy density of 11.7&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at a power density of 250.0&#8197;W&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in KOH electrolyte and 21.1&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 450.0&#8197;W&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; electrolyte and possess a capacitance retention of 98.1&#8201;% over 20,000 charge-discharge cycles.

         <title>Pyrrolation of Melem: A Facile Gateway into the Field of Monomeric s&#8208;Heptazine Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile synthetic route for the synthesis of monomeric s&#8208;heptazines is presented. The central compound of this new approach is 2,5,8&#8208;tri(1H&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;s&#8208;heptazine that was synthesized via an acid catalyzed pyrrolation of melem with 2,5&#8208;dimethoxytetrahydrofuran, which proved to be a potent starting material for the synthesis of further monomeric s&#8208;heptazines by reaction with both nucleophiles and electrophiles.







Abstract
Monomeric s&#8208;heptazines are an intriguing class of compounds with many attractive properties for various areas of application such as photocatalysis or organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. However, research into these properties has so far been challenging, as only a few synthetic routes for the preparation of monomeric s&#8208;heptazines are known in the literature. Furthermore, these few reported synthetic pathways generally require the use of specialized equipment that may not be available to all laboratories interested in studying monomeric s&#8208;heptazines. For this reason, a more accessible synthetic route for the preparation of monomeric s&#8208;heptazines has been developed in the course of this work. The central compound of this new approach is 2,5,8&#8208;tri(1H&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;s&#8208;heptazine, which could be conveniently synthesized via an acid catalyzed pyrrolation of melem with bench&#8208;stable 2,5&#8208;dimethoxytetrahydrofuran in a simple one&#8208;pot synthesis in air. This compound was shown to be a potent starting material for the synthesis of numerous other monomeric s&#8208;heptazines by reaction with both nucleophiles and electrophiles. The monomeric s&#8208;heptazines thus accessible were analyzed for their crystal structures by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and for their optical properties by ultraviolet/visible and photoluminescence spectroscopy.

         <title>Diiron(IV)&#8208;Oxo Species and Water Oxidation: How Crucial is Electronic Cooperativity?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study employs DFT methods to elucidate the catalytic mechanism of water oxidation by a high&#8208;valent diiron(IV)&#8208;oxo complex. The findings reveal a bifurcated electron&#8208;proton transfer pathway, highlight the role of adventitious water molecules in stabilizing intermediates, and emphasize the importance of spin&#8208;state modulation, metal&#8208;metal cooperativity, and ligand design in driving efficient O&#8722;H bond activation.







Abstract
Water splitting, crucial for generating oxygen and hydrogen, remains a central challenge in chemistry due to its importance in developing sustainable energy sources and addressing environmental concerns. Consequently, numerous complexes have been developed to split water and release oxygen and hydrogen, albeit typically requiring external sources such as thermal, photo, or electrochemical methods. In this context, the discovery of a (&#956;&#8208;oxo)bis(&#956;&#8208;carboxamido) diiron(IV) complex, [FeIV&#8322;O(L)&#8322;]2+ (L=N,N&#8208;bis&#8208;(3&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4&#8217;&#8208;methoxypyridyl&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;methyl)&#8208;N&#8217;&#8208;acetyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminoethane), which activates both C&#8722;H and O&#8722;H bonds without external stimuli, has attracted significant attention. Notably, this complex generates hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) without O&#8322; evolution and displays termolecular kinetics, presenting a rare and intriguing mechanistic puzzle. In this work, we explore the catalytic mechanism of water oxidation by this diiron(IV) complex using DFT methods. Our computational findings validate experimental observations regarding the necessity of a second water molecule in the reaction, revealing a bifurcated electron&#8208;proton transfer (BEPT) pathway driven by termolecular reactivity. Moreover, we highlight the crucial role of excess water molecules in stabilising the reaction intermediates, particularly via interaction with the &#8208;OMe groups to form a water cluster model. The inclusion of explicit water molecules was found to reduce the activation barrier to 23.5&#8197;kJ/mol from the reactant and 62.7&#8197;kJ/mol from the reactant complex, whereas, with only one water molecule present, the barrier was 344.3&#8197;kJ/mol, highlighting the critical role of the adventitious water molecule at the active site. Our study underscores the importance of metal&#8208;metal cooperativity, ligand design, spin&#8208;state modulation, and second&#8208;sphere effects in shaping the catalytic behaviour. These insights provide a detailed understanding of the electronic structure and reactivity, offering valuable guidelines for future catalyst design in water oxidation and beyond.

         <title>Unveiling Quantum Coherence Effects in Modulating Electron Transfer in Platinum (II) Donor&#8208;Acceptor&#8208;Donor Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discover the pivotal role of quantum coherence effects (QCEs) in modulating electron transfer within cis&#8208;acetylide Pt(II) donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8208;A&#8208;D) systems. Using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, we unveil how charge separation (CS) rates are amplified 4&#8211;8&#8208;fold, driven by quantum interference. The findings reveal a 2&#8211;3&#8208;fold enhancement in electronic coupling, shedding light on advanced charge transport mechanisms.







Abstract
Quantum coherence effects (QCEs), arising from the interference of wave&#8208;like amplitudes, are crucial in controlling the electron transfer function of molecular systems. Here, we report a coherence phenomenon associated with charge separation (CS) in a range of Pt (II) cis&#8208;acetylide donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8208;A&#8208;D) systems, where the photogenerated Pt (III) center acts as an acceptor connecting two (R)phenothiazine (R = H or tBu) donors. Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy revealed that CS rates in D&#8208;A&#8208;D systems with double CS paths were accelerated by 4&#8211;8 times compared to their donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) counterparts with a single path. An enhancement factor of 2&#8211;3 in electronic coupling, within the context of interference between CS paths, is derived, providing a clear signature of QCEs. This enhancementin CS processes closely correlates with the strength of coupling between donors. This study highlights the significant impact of QCEs on the photophysical properties of molecular systems and offers insights into charge and energy transport mechanisms in both natural and artificial systems.

         <title>Alexidine and Pentamidine Fold Inside the Bowl&#8208;shaped Cavity of p&#8208;Sulfonato&#8208;calix[4]arene</title>

         <dc:description>
The simple bowl&#8208;shaped macrocyclic host promotes conformational fixing and crystallization of the guest molecules of high conformational freedom in aqueous media. The binding site in both crystal structures is the central aliphatic chain enabling guest folding through adopting gauche conformation upon entering the calix[4]arene cavity.







Abstract
We report on the U&#8208;shaped folding of flexible guest molecules of medicinal interest upon their inclusion into macrocyclic cavity of p&#8208;sulfonato&#8208;calix[4]arene in aqueous media. Alexidine and pentamidine are FDA&#8208;approved drug compounds currently rediscovered as potent membrane&#8208;targeting antibiotic adjuvants helping restore antibiotic activity against multidrug resistant bacteria pathogens. We have adopted host&#8208;guest and crystal engineering approach to study these drugs with a view of potential supramolecular formulations and/or crystal forms. We focus on the host&#8208;guest conformational and structural behaviour of alexidine and pentamidine under macrocyclic confinement conditions benefitting from single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, self&#8208;assembly studies in solution by NMR spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering and atomic force microscopy, and ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM&#8211;MS) analysis complemented by theoretical calculations. Our findings show that the simple bowl&#8208;shaped host promotes conformational fixing and crystallization of these guest molecules of high conformational freedom that are otherwise challenging to crystallize. The IM&#8211;MS structural studies of p&#8208;sulfonato&#8208;calix[4]arene complexes with pentamidine and alexidine revealed significant guest reorganization in the solution/gas phase, compared to the binding modes observed in the crystal structures. Despite these changes, the host&#8208;guest complexation remained consistent, with new interactions highlighting the increased role of electrostatic forces in the gas phase.

We focus on the host-guest conformational and structural behaviour of alexidine and pentamidine under macrocyclic confinement conditions benefitting from single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, self-assembly studies in solution by NMR spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering and atomic force microscopy, and ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM&#8211;MS) analysis complemented by theoretical calculations. Our findings show that the simple bowl-shaped host promotes conformational fixing and crystallization of these guest molecules of high conformational freedom that are otherwise challenging to crystallize. The IM&#8211;MS structural studies of &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-sulfonato-calix[4]arene complexes with pentamidine and alexidine revealed significant guest reorganization in the solution/gas phase, compared to the binding modes observed in the crystal structures. Despite these changes, the host-guest complexation remained consistent, with new interactions highlighting the increased role of electrostatic forces in the gas phase.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Silicon&#8208;Based Linkers for Tunable Acid&#8208;Sensitive Drug Release from Polymeric Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by silyl protecting groups we have developed silicon based linkers having both a hydroxyl containing drug and a polymerizable group. Upon polymerization nanoparticles are formed from which the drug can be released under acidic conditions. This opens up possibilities for future use of these nanoparticles in treatment of diseases. As a model we have studied the release of gemcitabine.







Abstract
Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) may benefit from a carrier to improve their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Core&#8208;crosslinked polymeric micelles (CCPMs) are carriers for hydrophobic small molecule APIs. In CCPMs, APIs are generally covalently coupled to the core of the micelles by use of a linker, which can be tailored to adjust the release rate of the API. Acid triggered release is promising because of local acidic environment in the tissue of interest, and expected uptake via endocytosis. In the present study, silyl&#8208;based linkers were synthesized, and attached to gemcitabine as model API to investigate the tunability of release by introduction of different substituents. Attachment was achieved via an Si ether bond, with the linker coupled to the primary alcohol functionality on gemcitabine. By varying the substituents on the silyl atom, we could vary the release half&#8208;life (t1/2) of native gemcitabine from &lt;1&#8197;hour&#8211;&gt;96&#8197;hours at pH&#8197;5.0 at 37&#8201;&#176;C, compared to a t1/2 of 24&#8211;&gt;240&#8197;hours at pH&#8197;7.4 at 37&#8201;&#176;C, respectively. The steric hinderance caused by substituents contributed to an increase of t1/2 at pH&#8197;5.0, as the largest substituents resulted in the slowest release. Extension to other APIs and other carriers is clearly possible.

         <title>Single&#8208;molecule Magnet Properties of Silole&#8208; and Stannole&#8208;ligated Erbium Cyclo&#8208;octatetraenyl Sandwich Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis, structures and dynamic magnetic properties of erbium&#8208;silole and erbium&#8208;stannole complexes are reported and compared to those of the analogous erbium&#8208;germole complex. Remarkable similarities in the single&#8208;molecule magnet properties of the three complexes are unearthed, highlighting the minimal role of the heavier group 14 elements in slow magnetic relaxation behaviour.







Abstract
The synthesis, structures and magnetic properties of an &#951;5&#8208;silole complex and an &#951;5&#8208;stannole complex of erbium are reported. The sandwich complex anions [(&#951;5&#8208;CpSi)Er(&#951;8&#8208;COT)]&#8211; and [(&#951;5&#8208;CpSn)Er(&#951;8&#8208;COT)]&#8211;, where CpSi is [SiC4&#8208;2,5&#8208;(SiMe3)2&#8208;3,4&#8208;Ph2]2&#8211; (1Si), CpSn is [SnC4&#8208;2,5&#8208;(SiMe3)2&#8208;3,4&#8208;Me2]2&#8211; (1Sn) and COT=cyclo&#8208;octatetraenyl, were obtained as their [K(2.2.2&#8208;cryptand)]+ salts and found to be isostructural, with remarkably similar bond lengths and angles, differing only in the lengths of the Er&#8211;E interactions (E=Si, Sn). The parallels in the molecular structures of 1Si and 1Sn are reflected in their dynamic magnetic properties, which show single&#8208;molecule magnet behaviour in zero applied field, with effective energy barriers of 115&#177;7 and 125&#177;3 cm&#8211;1, respectively, along with comparable magnetic relaxation times. Analysis of the two complexes using ab initio calculations reveals differences at a quantitative level, but overall similar electronic structures, with the thermally activated relaxation likely to proceed via the first&#8208;excited Kramers doublet. Comparing 1Si and 1Sn with the previously reported germanium analogue 1Ge reveals that swapping one heavier group 14 element for another in complexes of the type [(&#951;5&#8208;CpE)Er(&#951;8&#8208;COT)]&#8211; has a minimal impact on the SMM behaviour.

         <title>Chalcogen Vacancies as Key Drivers of Distinct Physicochemistry in MoS2, MoSe2, and MoTe2&#160;for Selective Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic performance of Mo&#8208;based transition&#8208;metal&#8208;dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers is intrinsically tied to their physicochemical properties. However, the limited chemical diversity among these materials constrains their versatility for key catalytic processes, including carbon dioxide (CRR), nitrogen (NRR), and oxygen (ORR) reduction reactions. This study employs density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the impact of chalcogen vacancies on the properties of MoS2, MoSe2, and MoTe2, focusing on the adsorption behaviors of CO, NO, and NO2. The findings reveal that chalcogen vacancies not only enhance surface reactivity but also impart distinctive physicochemical characteristics to each TMD. These effects arise from intrinsic bonding differences, resulting in distinct charge availability at exposed Mo atoms and variations in vacancy dimensions, which shape specific surface interactions. Hence, while adsorption differences between pristine surfaces are generally negligible for catalysis, vacancies amplify them by over an order of magnitude, resulting in pronounced material&#8208;specific behaviors. Moreover, varying vacancy dimensions affect how species incorporate into defects, further enhancing the differences. These characteristics unlock substantial potential of TMD sheets for distinct surface chemistries, transforming them from relatively similar to markedly different as defect density rises. Consequently, our findings provide fundamental insights for tailoring these materials toward applications in electro&#8208; and photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Diboron Reagents in N&#8208;N Bond Cleavage of Hydrazines, N&#8208;Nitrosamines, and Azides: Reactivity and Mechanistic Insights</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diboron reagents are known for their ability to promote the deoxygenation of amine or pyridine oxides, nitroarenes, and nitrones through the formation of B&#8208;O&#8208;B bonds. In this study, we have investigated the potential of diboron reagents to induce N&#8208;N bond cleavage in hydrazines, N&#8208;nitrosamines and azides. Our findings show that the combination of B2nep2 as diboron source and KOMe as a Lewis base can effectively promote the N&#8208;N cleavage of a wide variety of substrates. For hydrazines and nitrosamines, the presence of an aryl group is essential for the reaction to proceed, probably due to a better stabilization of the negative charge developed during N&#8208;N bond cleavage. Both types of azides, aromatic and aliphatic, are easily reduced, and the resulting amines can be in situ converted into the corresponding amides by simple treatment with a carboxylic acid. Experimental and theoretical calculations suggest a non&#8208;radical mechanism, with concerted B&#8208;B and N&#8208;N bond cleavage in the case of hydrazines and azides, and a stepwise mechanism in the case of N&#8208;nitrosamines, where deoxygenation occurs as the first step, involving the formation of an N&#8208;nitrene intermediate</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alstrostine A and isoalstrostine A are monoterpenoid indole alkaloid glycosides with unique structures found in the plant families Apocynaceae and Rubiaceae. With molecular weights exceeding 900, nine&#160;chiral centers (excluding sugar rings), and complex fused&#8208;ring structures, the structural elucidation of these molecules using spectral analysis is highly challenging. Therefore, their structural identification through total synthesis is important in both natural product chemistry and synthetic organic chemistry. In this study, we successfully accomplished the first asymmetric total syntheses of these alkaloids in 18 or 19 steps. A key synthetic feature was a two&#8208; or three&#8208;component coupling reaction between secologanin and a pyrrolidinoindoline moiety based on our proposed biosynthetic pathway. This approach enabled the synthesis of all isomers of the pyrrolidinoindoline ring, which constitutes the upper fragment of the alstrostines, and allowed us to revise the stereochemistry of alstrostine A. Additionally, a compound previously isolated as alstrostine A from Palicourea luxurians (Rubiaceae) was successfully reidentified and renamed as epialstrostine A.</dc:description>

         <title>Radical Cation of Tris(triarylamine) Connected through 1,2,3&#8208;Benzenetriyl Bridge: A Three&#8208;Redox&#8208;Center Organic Mixed&#8208;Valence System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To explore intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (ICT) pathways in three&#8208;redox&#8208;center organic mixed&#8208;valence (MV) radical cation, a tris(triarylamine) (TTA), in which three triarylamine (TA) redox&#8208;active centers are connected in a side&#8208;by&#8208;side fashion via 1,2,3&#8208;benzenetriyl bridging unit, has been newly synthesized. The MV state of the TTA radical cation has been investigated by a combination of experimental and theoretical methods, and the ICT pathway between three redox&#8208;active centers has been revealed. The intervalence CT (IVCT) band analysis gave an electronic coupling value comparable to the&#160;ortho&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bridged bis(triarylamine) radical cation. Dynamic electron spin resonance studies clarified that the TTA radical cation was a nondegenerate MV system exhibiting ICT between the central TA and the peripheral TAs through the&#160;ortho&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bridge.</dc:description>

         <title>External Phosphate Binding Triggered Formation of Coordination Bridged Dimer of Macrocyclic Trinuclear Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrocyclic complexes with spatially&#8208;arranged coordination sites have the potential to create unique supramolecular systems that combine the precise switching of self&#8208;assembled structures with the coordinative recognition of specific molecules. We now report a macrocyclic trinuclear Zn complex that undergoes a unique dimerization by molecular binding from the outside. The multinuclear complex was synthesized from a trispap ligand, a designed macrocyclic trimer of an&#160;N,N,O&#8208;type tridentate chelating unit pap. This macrocyclic ligand is capable of fixing the metal centers and retaining their exchangeable coordination sites. The macrocyclic trimer reacts with zinc acetate to form the trinuclear complex, in which the coordination sites of the three zinc atoms are aligned perpendicular to the macrocyclic plane and capped with the acetates. Subsequently, phosphate anion, PO43&#8211;, coordinates from one side of the macrocycle in a tripodal manner. This phosphate binding produced an electrically&#8208;neutral complex moiety with available coordination sites on the other side of the macrocycle which leads to the formation of the coordination&#8208;bridged dimer.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Seawater Oxygen Evolution with Improved Electronic Environment of NiCoPS through Fluorine Doping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing economical and robust electrocatalysts to prevent chlorine ions corrosion and improve seawater splitting efficiency is essential for seawater electrolysis. Herein, fluorine&#8208;doped nickel cobalt phospho&#8208;sulfide nanowires (F&#8208;NiCoPS NWs) were synthesized as high&#8208;performance catalysts for overall seawater splitting. The strongly electronegative F anion is favorable to build weak metal fluorine bonds, which easily break to generate highly active species of Ni/Co&#8208;hydroxides/oxyhydroxides protective layer on the electrode surface. This process effectively avoids chlorine evolution reaction (ClER)&#8208;induced dissolution, and enhances the stability of catalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the electronegative fluorine affects the electronic structure of the catalyst&#8217; surface, further enhancing the adsorption energy and electronic conductivity of the reaction intermediates. F&#8208;NiCoPS with appropriate F doping significantly decreased the overpotential (228 (303) mV at 10 (100) mA cm&#8208;2) and the Tafel slope (44 mV dec&#8208;1) in alkaline seawater, and exhibited a long stability of 100 h. This work provides new insights for constructing effective, cost&#8208;efficient and non&#8208;noble metal electrocatalyst for alkaline seawater splitting.</dc:description>

         <title>Guest molecules containing rich&#8208;electron group incorporation into Zn&#8208;based MOF for the enhancement of iodine uptake</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radioactive iodine capture is a major concern for nuclear power generation and environmental protection. Many metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been designed and synthesized to adsorb iodine from vapor or solution, but most of them exhibited unsatisfactory iodine uptake performance because of the insufficiency of adsorption sites. Herein, we chose 1&#8208;vinyl&#8208;3&#8208;ethylimidazolium bromide (VIMB) and 1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane (DACH) with rich&#8208;electron group as guest molecules, respectively, and encapsulated them into a three&#8208;dimensional Zn&#8208;based MOF Zn&#8208;BINOL with large 1D channel (BINOL = (R)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diethoxy&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl&#8208;4,4&#8242;,6,6&#8242;&#8208;tetrabenzoate), as a result, two efficient iodine adsorbents VIMB@Zn&#8208;BINOL and DACH@Zn&#8208;BINOL were obtained. The equilibrium iodine vapor adsorption amounts of them are 1448 and 1680 mg/g at 75 &#186;C, being about 2.1 and 2.4 times more than that of Zn&#8208;BINOL, respectively. This work will provide more synthetic methods on design and preparation of iodine adsorbents with good adsorption capacity.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking Catalysis Using Oxidatively Induced Reductive Elimination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidatively induced reductive elimination (OIRE) has become a crucial chemical process to enable the effective formation of otherwise much less accessible products. The chemically, electrochemically, or photochemically triggered oxidation of appropriate metal complexes leading to a reductive elimination process otherwise chemically unfavorable has long been studied in stoichiometric metal&#8208;centered reactions. However, its conscious inclusion and targeted application in catalysis is a rather recent development. Ruthenium and Group 9 metal complexes are particularly representative examples of how the observed OIRE abilities can be modulated using different coupling partners. Parallels can be drawn between rhodium and iridium, which have a long history as efficient catalysts, and their more readily available 3d row metal neighbor, i.e. cobalt, with ruthenium also providing a parallel reactivity. This review explores the history of OIRE reactions throughout the last few centuries, highlighting the role of Ti, Mo, Fe, Ru, Ni, Hg and group 9 transition metals as key players in C&#8208;H bond functionalization and OIRE chemistry, discussing the most relevant studies published in the field whilst pinpointing research gaps that require new theoretical and mechanistic studies, with the final goal of unlocking the full potential of OIRE chemistry in organometallic homogeneous catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Based Copolymers for Templated Synthesis and Stabilization of Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface functionalization and colloidal stability are pivotal for numerous applications of gold nanoparticles (Au&#8208;NPs). Over the past decade, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have emerged as promising ligands for stabilizing Au&#8208;NPs owing to their ease of synthesis, structural diversity, and strong metal&#8208;ligand bonds. Here, we introduce new Au(I)&#8208;NHC copolymer scaffolds as precursors to multidentate NHC&#8208;protected Au&#8208;NPs. Ring&#8208;opening metathesis copolymerization of a norbornene&#8208;appended Au(I)&#8208;NHC complex with another functionalized norbornene comonomer provides a diverse array of Au(I)&#8208;NHC copolymers with modular compositions and structures. Upon reduction, these copolymers yield multidentate polyNHC&#8208;coated Au&#8208;NPs with varied properties and corona functionalities dictated by the secondary monomer. These nanoparticles exhibit excellent size homogeneity and stability against aggregation in various buffers, cell culture media, and under exposure to electrolytes, oxidants, and exogenous thiols over extended periods.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Surface functionalization and colloidal stability are pivotal for numerous applications of gold nanoparticles (Au-NPs). Over the past decade, N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have emerged as promising ligands for stabilizing Au-NPs owing to their ease of synthesis, structural diversity, and strong metal-ligand bonds. Here, we introduce new Au(I)-NHC copolymer scaffolds as precursors to multidentate NHC-protected Au-NPs. Ring-opening metathesis copolymerization of a norbornene-appended Au(I)-NHC complex with another functionalized norbornene comonomer provides a diverse array of Au(I)-NHC copolymers with modular compositions and structures. Upon reduction, these copolymers yield multidentate polyNHC-coated Au-NPs with varied properties and corona functionalities dictated by the secondary monomer. These nanoparticles exhibit excellent size homogeneity and stability against aggregation in various buffers, cell culture media, and under exposure to electrolytes, oxidants, and exogenous thiols over extended periods. Moreover, we demonstrate the post-synthetic surface functionalization reactions of polyNHC-Au-NPs while maintaining colloidal stability, highlighting their robustness and potential for applications such as bioconjugation. Overall, these findings underscore the potential of our ROMP-derived NHC-containing copolymers as highly tunable and versatile multidentate ligands that may be suitable for other inorganic colloids and flat surfaces with a wide array of applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quinones as Multifunctional Scaffolds for Oxidative, Reductive, and HAT Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoredox catalysis, which enables both electron and hydrogen atom transfer, has become a powerful tool for activating chemical bonds and synthesizing complex molecules under mild conditions. Typically, photocatalysts
are optimized either for oxidative or reductive reactions within a limited redox window (less than 3.1 V) and for
hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reactions, with few frameworks capable of mediating both pathways for high redox&#8208;demanding reactions (covering more than a 5 V redox window) without requiring special conditions. Herein, we report the use of quinones as multifunctional scaffolds in light&#8208;driven redox transformations, offering access to a redox window of approximately 5 V using visible light. The quinone scaffold's versatility facilitates a wide range of radical and ionic processes under both oxidative and reductive conditions, in addition to enabling HAT reactions. By keeping the parameters, i.e. the reaction partners, constant, such transformations can be carried out under just two reaction conditions. Oxidative transformations and HAT reactions occur under ambient air, while activation of the chromophore for reductive transformations can be achieved using an inorganic base (Cs2CO3) via a simple acid&#8208;base deprotonation event. This dual capability highlights the potential of quinones as scaffolds to extend their utility in photoredox catalysis.</dc:description>
