         <title>Artificial Supramolecular Pumps Powered by Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;driven supramolecular pumping was achieved, as a result of unidirectional threading and dethreading movements, by combining photoisomerization and self&#8208;assembly processes in a closed reaction network (represented by reservoirs and pipes in the cover image). While light irradiation (bulb and gears) pushes the species energetically uphill, subsequent exergonic reactions (falling water) convert energy into motion, and a continuous and directional transfer along the cycle (the water flow) is observed at the photostationary state. Artwork by Stefano Corra. More information can be found in the Full Paper by A. Credi et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101163).

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Benzobicyclo[3.2.1]octanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lawsone is naturally obtained from Henna plant leaves (as shown in the cover image), which are responsible for the red&#8208;orange pigment properties. It is well known in the cosmetic industry as a natural coloring agent for hair, nails, and skin. Over the centuries, lawsone has been frequently used as a natural beauty product, but the pharmaceutical applications of lawsone and its analogs are still underexplored. To fulfill these shortcomings, we started utilizing lawsone as a synthon for a new class of cascade reactions to synthesize structurally complex molecules, which are analogues of biologically and pharmaceutically active molecules. We sincerely thank Dr. M. A. Pasha for the excellent design of the cover. More information can be found in the Communication by D.&#8197;B. Ramachary et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100985).

         <title>PorphyStruct: A Digital Tool for the Quantitative Assignment of Non&#8208;Planar Distortion Modes in Four&#8208;Membered Porphyrinoids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PorphyStruct is a new digital tool that allows quick and easy analyses of hidden conformational features of porphyrinoids from structural data. The software introduces the well&#8208;established technique of normal&#8208;mode structural decomposition (NSD) to porphyrinoids like the corroles, and while retaining the terminology of the NSD method, it is flexible with respect to the size and shape of the macrocycle perimeter. The cover image shows the utopia of a futuristic analysis laboratory where life&#8208;size molecules are analysed for such hidden structural characteristics. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J.&#8197;Krumsieck and M.&#8197;Br&#246;ring. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101243).

         <title>Rationalizing the Mechanism of Peroxyformate Decomposition: Computational Insights To Understand Solvent Influence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvent effects revealed: An exhaustive mechanistic investigation into the decomposition of tert&#8208;butyl peroxyformate based on DFT calculations sheds light on how the reaction proceeds and how it is modulated depending on the nature and polarity of the surrounding medium. The computed mechanistic pathways are in excellent agreement with the experimental trends for a variety of polar and nonpolar solvents.







Abstract
The heterolytic decomposition of tert&#8208;butyl peroxyformate to tert&#8208;butanol and carbon dioxide, catalyzed by pyridine, is a long&#8208;known example of a reaction whose kinetics are strongly affected by solvent polarity. From DFT and ab initio methods together with the SMD implicit solvation model, an extension on the formerly accepted mechanism is proposed. This novel proposal involves the formation of a carbonic acid ester intermediate and its further decomposition, through an unreported pyridine&#8208;mediated stepwise route. Computed barriers for this mechanism at DLPNO/CCSD(T)&#8208;def2&#8208;TZVP are in excellent agreement with experimental kinetic data across different solvents. Furthermore, the strong relationships between activation energies, geometric parameters in the transition state and the characteristics of the different solvents are also analyzed in depth.

         <title>Correlation between the Dynamics of Nanoconfined Water and the Local Chemical Environment in Calcium Silicate Hydrate Nanominerals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultra&#8208;fast synthesis of calcium silicate hydrates was performed in supercritical water that acts as a solvent for mimicking the natural conditions at high pressure and high temperature of the geological process. The synthesised xonotlite and tobermorite represent perfect Ca&#8722;OH&#8208;rich and Si&#8722;OH&#8208;rich model nanocrystals for investigating the effect of different chemical environments on the dynamics of confined water. These results could be applied to other water&#8208;containing construction materials. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J.&#8197;S. Dolado, C. Aymonier et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100098).

         <title>Facile Approach to C&#8208;Glucosides by Using a Protecting&#8208;Group&#8208;Free Hiyama Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction: High&#8208;Yielding Dapagliflozin Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silyl hydride derivative of d&#8208;glucal was used conveniently as a bench&#8208;stable precursor for the construction of C&#8208;glycosidic bond. After activation by fluoride&#8208;mediated dehydrogenative hydrolysis, an intermediate silanol species was used for Hiyama arylation. Various aryl and heteroaryl C&#8208;glycosides, C&#8208;glycopeptides, as well as both a&#8208; and b&#8208;isomers of Dapagliflozin could be constructed rapidly and without the need for protecting groups. The cover image was designed by Tom&#225;&#353; Bello&#328; at IOCB Prague. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K.&#8197;Parkan et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101052).

The cover image was designed by Tom&#225;&#353; Bello&#328; at IOCB Prague. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K.&#8197;Parkan et&#8197;al.

         <title>Low concentration C2H6 capture enabled by size matching in the ultramicropore</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low concentration ethane capture is crucial for environmental protection and natural gas purification. The ideal physisorbent with strong C 2 H 6 interaction and large C 2 H 6 uptake at low&#8208;concentration level has rarely been reported, due to the large p K a value and small quadrupole moment of C 2 H 6 . Herein, we demonstrate the perfectly size matching between the ultramicropore (pore size of 4.6 &#197;) and ethane (kinetic diameter of 4.4 &#197;) in a nickel pyridine&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylate metal&#8208;organic framework ( PC&#8208;4&#8208;Ni ), which enables the record&#8208;breaking performance for low concentration C 2 H 6 capture. PC&#8208;4&#8208;Ni exhibits the large C 2 H 6 adsorption enthalpy of 56.7 kJ/mol, and record&#8208;high C 2 H 6 uptake at low pressure of 0.01&#8208;0.1 bar and 298 K (1.8 mmol/g at 0.01 bar). Molecule simulations and C 2 H 6 &#8208;loading crystal structure analysis revealed that the maximized interaction sites in PC&#8208;4&#8208;Ni with ethane molecule originates the strong C 2 H 6 adsorption. The dynamic breakthrough experiments for gas mixtures of C 2 H 6 /N 2 (1/999, v / v ) and C 2 H 6 /CH 4 (5/95, v / v ) proved the excellent low&#8208;concentration C 2 H 6 capture performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis and Bioactivity Mapping of Geodiamolide H</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The F&#8208;actin stabilizing natural product geodiamolide H and its analogues were comprehensively investigated. The first total synthesis of geodiamolide H was enabled by optimized, scalable building block synthesis, improved couplings, and by a ring&#8208;closing metathesis as a key step. Biological profiling of the synthesized library in cells, on target, and in silico uncovered potent and simplified non&#8208;natural analogues. Additional structure&#8208;activity relationship information was extracted for the whole class, useful for tool compound design.







Abstract
The first total synthesis of the actin&#8208;stabilizing marine natural product geodiamolide H was achieved. Solid&#8208;phase based peptide assembly paired with scalable stereoselective syntheses of polyketide building blocks and an optimized esterification set the stage for investigating the key ring&#8208;closing metathesis. Geodiamolide H and synthetic analogues were characterized for their toxicity and for antiproliferative effects in cellulo, by characterising actin polymerization induction in&#8197;vitro, and by docking on the F&#8208;actin target and property computation in silico, for a better understanding of structure&#8208;activity relationships (SAR). A non&#8208;natural analogue of geodiamolide H was discovered to be most potent in the series, suggesting significant potential for tool compound design.

         <title>Experimental and Computational Models for Side Chain Discrimination in Peptide&#8211;Protein Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A model system to study interactions between aromatic cavities and non&#8208;polar side chains was developed and studied by different NMR methods, where a weak but evident side&#8208;chain discrimination was observed. The experimental quantitative and qualitative data was used to evaluate different computational methods, with the conclusion that for this system, molecular mechanics gave more accurate results than density functional theory calculations.







Abstract
A bis(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6) Tr&#246;ger's base receptor and 4&#8208;substituted hepta&#8208;1,7&#8208;diyl bisammonium salt ligands have been used as a model system to study the interactions between non&#8208;polar side chains of peptides and an aromatic cavity of a protein. NMR titrations and NOESY/ROESY NMR spectroscopy were used to analyze the discrimination of the ligands by the receptor based on the substituent of the ligand, both quantitatively (free binding energies) and qualitatively (conformations). The analysis showed that an all&#8208;anti conformation of the heptane chain was preferred for most of the ligands, both free and when bound to the receptor, and that for all of the receptor&#8208;ligand complexes, the substituent was located inside or partly inside of the aromatic cavity of the receptor. We estimated the free binding energy of a methyl&#8208; and a phenyl group to an aromatic cavity, via CH&#8208;&#960;, and combined aromatic CH&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions to be &#8722;1.7 and &#8722;3.3&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1, respectively. The experimental results were used to assess the accuracy of different computational methods, including molecular mechanics (MM) and density functional theory (DFT) methods, showing that MM was superior.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bis&#8208;NHC stabilized germyliumylidenes [RGe(NHC)2]+ are typically Lewis basic (LB) in nature, owing to their lone pair and coordination of two NHCs to the vacant p&#8208;orbitals of the germanium atom. However, they can also show Lewis acidity (LA) via Ge&#8208;CNHC&#963;* orbital. Utilizing this unique electronic feature, we report the first example of bis&#8208;NHC&#8208;stabilized germyliumylidene [MesTerGe(NHC)2]Cl (1), (MesTer= 2,6&#8208;(2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2)2C6H3; NHC= IMe4 = 1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) catalyzed reduction of CO2 with amines and silane, which proceeds via its Lewis basic nature. In contrast, the Lewis acid nature of 1 is utilized in the catalyzed hydroboration and cyanosilylation of carbonyls. Thus, highlighting the versatile ambiphilic nature of bis&#8208;NHC stabilized germyliumylidenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating by molecular design the enantiodiscrimination features of inherently chiral selectors: a HPLC and voltammetry study case with atropisomeric 2,2&#8217;&#8208; biindole based monomers and oligomer films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new family of inherently chiral electroactive selectors based on the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;biindole atropisomeric scaffold, of easy synthesis and modulable functional properties, is introduced and studied in cascade in two enantioselection contests. They are at first investigated as probes in enantioselective HPLC, studying molecular structure and temperature effects, and achieving very efficient semipreparative enantioseparation. The enantiomers thus obtained, of remarkable chiroptical features (optical rotation as well as circular dichroism), are successfully applied as selectors in chiral voltammetry in different media for discrimination of the enantiomers of chiral electroactive probes, either by conversion into enantiopure electroactive electrode surfaces by electrooligomerization on glassy carbon substrate (the two monomers with shorter alkyl chains), or as chiral additive in achiral ionic liquid (the monomer with longest alkyl chains). Discrimination is conveniently and reproducibly achieved in terms of significant potential differences for the two enantiomers, specularly inverting either probe or selector configuration. In one case successful discrimination is also observed with the two probe enantiomers concurrently present, either as racemate or with enantiomeric excesses, neatly accounted for by the peak current ratios.</dc:description>

Let&#8242;s assemble! Different active substances can be formulated within one carrier system. A novel melamine&#8208;formaldehyde/polyethyleneimine coating for microcapsules results in microcapsules with a positive surface charge. Based on electrostatic interactions with negative charged poly&#8208;l&#8208;lactide and poly(lactide&#8208;co&#8208;glycolide) nanocapsules, a pH&#8208;responsive hierarchical capsule@capsule system was formed. Controlled assembling (pH&#8197;7) and disassembling (pH&#8197;3) between nanocapsules and microcapsules was demonstrated.







Abstract
The combination of several active substances into one carrier is often limited due to solubility, stability and phase&#8208;separation issues. These issues have been addressed by an innovative capsule design, in which nanocapsules are assembled on the microcapsule surface by electrostatic forces to form a pH&#8208;responsive hierarchical capsule@capsule system. Here, melamine&#8208;formaldehyde (MF) microcapsules with a negative surface charge were synthesized and coated with a novel MF&#8208;polyethyleneimine (PEI) copolymer to achieve a positive charge of &#950;=+28&#8197;mV. This novel coating procedure allows the electrostatic assembly of negatively charged poly&#8208;l&#8208;lactide (PLLA, &#950;=&#8722;19&#8197;mV) and poly&#8208;(lactide&#8208;co&#8208;glycolide) (PLGA, &#950;=&#8722;56&#8197;mV) nanocapsules on the microcapsule surface. Assembly studies at pH&#8197;7 gave a partial surface coverage of PLLA nanocapsules and full surface coverage for PLGA nanocapsules. The pH&#8208;responsive adsorption and desorption of nanocapsules was shown at pH&#8197;7 and pH&#8197;3.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Spiro&#8208;double Sila[7]helicene: The LUMO Spiro&#8208;conjugation</title>

         <dc:description>
Spiro&#8208;double sila[7]helicene was synthesized through four successive nucleophilic substitutions on silicon atom. The two helicene units were symmetrically and nearly perpendicularly arranged. Delocalization of the LUMO orbital through the spirosilabi[fluorene] moiety lowered the LUMO energy, red&#8208;shifted the emission spectra, and enhanced polarization in the absorption.







Abstract
A double helicene with a spiro&#8208;Si linker (4) was synthesized by four successive nucleophilic substitutions on SiCl4. Its (P,P), (M,M) and (P,M) isomers were isolated and characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. Due to the central spirosilabi[fluorene] moiety, the two helicene units in 4 are symmetrically and nearly perpendicularly arranged. (P,P)&#8208;4 and (M,M)&#8208;4 exhibit unique optical properties attributable to the LUMO spiro&#8208;conjugation between the two sila[7]helicene units.

         <title>Tuning the Size and Geometry of Heteroleptic Coordination Cages by Varying the Ligand Bent Angle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 36, Page 9439-9445, June 25, 2021. </description>

Angling for the right result: Heteroleptic Pd cages containing two types of dipyridyl ligands are described. The common feature of these complexes is the presence of two 1,3&#8208;di(pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)benzene ligands (depicted in gray). By varying the ligand bent angle, &#945;, of the second ligand, we were able to able to increase the nuclearity of the assembly from 4 to 8.







Abstract
Spherical assemblies of the type [PdnL2n]2n+ can be obtained from PdII salts and curved N&#8208;donor ligands, L. It is well established that the bent angle, &#945;, of the ligand is a decisive factor in the self&#8208;assembly process, with larger angles leading to complexes with a higher nuclearity, n. Herein, we report heteroleptic coordination cages of the type [PdnLnL&#8242;n]2n+, for which a similar correlation between the ligand bent angle and the nuclearity is observed. Tetranuclear cages were obtained by combining [Pd(CH3CN)4](BF4)2 with 1,3&#8208;di(pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)benzene and ligands featuring a bent angle of &#945;=120&#176;. The use of a dipyridyl ligand with &#945;=149&#176; led to the formation of a hexanuclear complex with a trigonal prismatic geometry; for linear ligands, octanuclear assemblies of the type [Pd8L8L&#8242;8]16+ were obtained. The predictable formation of heteroleptic PdII cages from 1,3&#8208;di(pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)benzene and different dipyridyl ligands is evidence that there are entire classes of heteroleptic cage structures that are privileged from a thermodynamic point of view.

         <title>Analysis of Non&#8208;innocence of Phosphaquinodimethane Ligands when Charge and Aromaticity Come into Play</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 36, Page 9350-9359, June 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In order to analyze their non&#8208;innocence character when ligated in M(CO)5 complexes, various phosphaquinodimethanes (pPQDM) and their complexes have been theoretically investigated regarding their electronic and structural properties, following corresponding changes in substitution, charge and spin state. Additionally, a combination of computed spin distributions and NICS values with geometric distortion models (HOMA, HOMQc) were used to gain further insights.







Abstract
Several phosphaquinodimethanes and their M(CO)5 complexes (M=Cr, Mo, W) and model derivatives have been theoretically investigated regarding the quest of non&#8208;innocence. Computed structural and electronic properties of the P&#8208;Me/NH2 substituted phosphaquinodimethanes and tungsten complexes revealed an interesting non&#8208;innocent ligand behaviour for the radical anion complexes with distonic ion character and a strong rearomatization of the middle phenyl ring. The latter was further probed taking also geometric aromaticity (HOMA) and quinoid distortion parameters (HOMQc) into account, as well as NICS(1). Furthermore, the effect of the P&#8208;substitution was investigated for real (or plausible) complexes and their free ligands focusing on the resulting aromaticity at the middle phenyl ring and vertical one&#8208;electron redox processes. The best picture of ligand engagement in redox changes was provided by representing NICS(1) values versus HOMA and the new geometric distortion parameter HOMQc8.

By attaching three n&#8208;hexyloxy chains to a triptycene triamine precursor, various soluble [4+4] and [4+6] imine cages were synthesized that were prior insoluble, revealing detailed insights in cage formation and exchange mechanisms by NMR spectroscopy in combination with gel permeation chromatography. The cubic [4+4] cage once formed is extraordinarily stable against exchange, although it is a clear thermodynamically controlled product.







Abstract
One of the most applied reaction types to synthesize shape&#8208;persistent organic cage compounds is the imine condensation reaction and it is assumed that the formed cages are thermodynamically controlled products due to the reversibility of the imine condensation. However, most of the synthesized imine cages reported are formed as precipitate from the reaction mixture and therefore rather may be kinetically controlled products. There are even examples in literature, where resulting cages are not soluble at all in common organic solvents to characterize or study their formation by NMR spectroscopy in solution. Here, a triptycene triamine containing three solubilizing n&#8208;hexyloxy chains has been used to synthesize soluble congeners of prior insoluble cages. This allowed us to study the formation as well as the reversibility of cage formation in solution by investigating exchange of building blocks between the cages and deuterated derivatives thereof.

         <title>The Unusual Photochromic and Hydrochromic Switching Behavior of Cellulose&#8208;Embedded 1,8&#8208;Naphthalimide&#8208;Viologen Derivatives in the Solid&#8208;State</title>

Water and Light Triggered Chromic Switching! A series of emissive 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide&#8208;viologen dyads were found to exhibit unusual dual photochromic and hydrochromic switching behavior in the solid phase when embedded in a cellulose matrix. Relying on humidity&#8208;sensitive solid state fluorescence hydrochromism and photoreduction processes, the dyads could be cycled unidirectionally between three distinct chromic states. Mechanistic investigations provided new insights into the role of cellulose&#8208;stabilized viologen radical cations in the process.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive chromic materials such as photochromics, hydrochromics, thermochromics, and electrochromics have a long history of capturing the attention of scientists due to their potential industrial applications and novelty in popular culture. However, hybrid chromic materials that combine two or more stimuli&#8208;triggered color changing properties are not so well known. Herein, we report a design strategy that has led to a series of emissive 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide&#8208;viologen dyads which exhibit unusual dual photochromic and hydrochromic switching behavior in the solid&#8208;state when embedded in a cellulose matrix. This behavior manifests as reversible solid state fluorescence hydrochromism upon changes in atmospheric relative humidity (RH), and reversible solid state photochromism upon generation of a cellulose&#8208;stabilized viologen radical cation. In this design strategy, the bipyridinium unit serves as both a water&#8208;sensitive receptor for the hydrochromic fluorophore&#8208;receptor system, and a photochromic group, capable of eliciting its own visible colorimetric response, generating a fluorescence quenching radical cation with prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. These dyes can be inkjet&#8208;printed onto cellulose paper or drop&#8208;cast as cellulose powder&#8208;based films and can be unidirectionally cycled between three different states which can be characteristically visualized under UV light or visible light. The material's photochromism, hydrochromism, and underlying mechanism of action was investigated using computational analysis, dynamic vapor sorption/desorption isotherms, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and variable humidity UV&#8208;Vis adsorption and fluorescence spectroscopies.

         <title>Mn3&#8722;xFexO4 Hollow Nanostructures for High&#8208;Performance Asymmetric Supercapacitor Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 36, Page 9398-9405, June 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large amount of Fe2+ was induced into Mn3O4 nanoparticles through effective electrodisplacement reaction to synthesize Mn3&#8722;xFeXO4 hollow nanostructures. By changing the addition of Fe2+, elemental compositions and structures of Mn3&#8722;xFexO4 could be well adjusted. The remarkable performance of Mn3&#8722;xFexO4 hollow nanostructures in pseudocapacitor applications is demonstrated. Compared with the original Mn3O4, the electrochemical performance of the obtained porous Mn3&#8722;xFexO4 nanostructure is significantly improved.







Abstract
Design of hollow nanostructure and controllable phase of mixed metal oxides for improving performance in supercapacitor applications is highly desirable. Here we demonstrate the rational design and synthesis of Mn3&#8722;xFexO4 hollow nanostructures for supercapacitor applications. Owing to high porosity and the specific surface area that provides more active sites for electrochemical reactions, the electrochemical performance of Mn3&#8722;xFexO4 hollow nanostructure substantially enhanced comparing with pristine Mn3O4. Particularly, in 1.0&#8197;M KOH electrolyte, Mn0.16Fe2.84O4 with a typical diameter of 20&#8197;nm exhibits excellent specific capacitance of 2675, 2320, 1662, 987&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at current densities of 1, 2, 5, 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively, which is significantly superior to those of other transition metal oxides. Besides, an asymmetric supercapacitor is assembled by using Mn0.16Fe2.84O4 and activated carbon as a positive and a negative electrode, respectively. Electrochemical results indicate a high energy density of 42&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 0.75&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1, which makes this hollow nanostructure a highly promising electrode for achieving high&#8208;performance next&#8208;generation supercapacitors.

         <title>Validation of Ab&#8208;Initio&#8208;Predicted Magnetic Anisotropies and Magneto&#8208;structural Correlations in Linear Hetero&#8208;trinuclear DyIII&#8208;NiII2 Compounds</title>

         <dc:description>
Discussed is a linear trinuclear DyIIINiII2 complex with a rare hexacoordinate DyIII center. The magnetic properties were studied experimentally by single crystal SQUID magnetometry, single crystal high&#8208;frequency/high&#8208;field EPR and paramagnetic NMR spectroscopy. Parameters describing the ground state multiplet splitting have also been computed by ab&#8208;initio quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, and the large variety of experimental techniques allows for a thorough validation of the computational analysis.







Abstract
Reported are single crystal SQUID and single crystal high&#8208;frequency/high&#8208;field EPR data of a trinuclear complex with a rare six&#8208;coordinate coordination sphere of a DyIII center coupled to two terminal six&#8208;coordinate NiII ions. The analysis of the single crystal spectroscopic parameters allows for an accurate description of the ground state wavefunction. The experimental analysis is supplemented by the analysis of the paramagnetic NMR spectra, allowing for a thorough description of the DyIII center. The experimental data are interpreted on the basis of an ab initio ligand field analysis, and the computed parameters are in good agreement with the experimental observations. This supports the quality of the theoretical approach based on a pseudo&#8208;spin Hamiltonian for the electronic ground state. Further support emerges from the ab initio ligand field theory based analysis of a structurally very similar system that, in contrast to the complex reported here, shows single molecule magnetic properties, and this is in agreement with the quantum&#8208;chemical prediction and analysis.

Framing an assay: We present nanosized zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) conjugated to immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies by using a strong and flexible covalent amino&#8208;alkyl link. These nanoZIF&#8208;IgG particles display good mobility and an excellent behaviour in dispersion. Their application to antibody&#8208;based bioanalytical assays, including enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA), was examined.







Abstract
Zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) hybrid fluorescent nanoparticles and ZIF antibody conjugates have been synthesized, characterized, and employed in lateral&#8208;flow immunoassay (LFIA). The bright fluorescence of the conjugates and the possibility to tailor their mobility gives a huge potential for diagnostic assays. An enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) as label, proved the integrity, stability, and dispersibility of the antibody conjugates, LC&#8208;MS/MS provided evidence that a covalent link was established between these metal&#8208;organic frameworks and lysine residues in IgG antibodies.

         <title>Synthesis of Lignans Based on a Borate&#8208;mediated One&#8208;pot Sequential Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Coupling of Cyclic Boranes</title>

Lignans are a kingdom of phytochemicals and have attracted much attention due to their structural variety and intriguing biological activities. Herein we report a unified synthetic approach to lignans that consisted of three phases: stereo&#8208;, substrate&#8208;, and skeletal&#8208;diversification. The approach was successfully applied to the syntheses of various lignans in a modular manner.







Abstract
Lignans are a group of polyphenolic phytochemicals that possess a large spectrum of chemical structures and biological activities. Here the syntheses of lignans &#8211; anwulignan, burseran, dehydroxycubebin, ruburisandrin B, and sesamin &#8211; are achieved based on a borate&#8208;mediated one&#8208;pot sequential Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling of cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;fused bicyclic boranes, which were prepared by diastereoselective cyclic hydroboration of exo&#8208;cyclic diene with cyclopentyl&#8208; and thexylboranes, respectively. A one&#8208;pot sequential Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling of each cyclic borate with various aryl bromides initiated by activation of the cyclic borane with the carbon nucleophile provided 2,3&#8208;dibenzylbutane derivatives with different aromatic substituents. Finally, the syntheses of naturally occurring lignans were accomplished in several steps from the products of Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling.

         <title>Molecular Sieving of Acetylene from Ethylene in a Rigid Ultra&#8208;microporous Metal Organic Framework.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 36, Page 9446-9453, June 25, 2021. </description>

Double (bond) take: The molecular sieving of C2H2 from C2H4 has been realized in a rigid ultra&#8208;microporous metal organic framework that enabled efficient one&#8208;step C2H4 production from the binary gas mixture C2H2/C2H4 and the ternary gas mixture C2H2/CO2/C2H4.







Abstract
Rigid molecular sieving materials are the ideal candidates for gas separation (e.&#8201;g., C2H2/C2H4) due to their ultrahigh adsorption selectivity and the absence of gas co&#8208;adsorption. However, the absolute molecular sieving effect for C2H2/C2H4 separation has rarely been realized because of their similar physicochemical properties. Herein, we demonstrate the absolute molecular sieving of C2H2 from C2H4 by a rigid ultra&#8208;microporous metal&#8208;organic framework (F&#8722;PYMO&#8722;Cu) with 1D regular channels (pore size of ca. 3.4&#8197;&#197;). F&#8722;PYMO&#8722;Cu exhibited moderate acetylene uptake (35.5&#8197;cm3/cm3), but very low ethylene uptake (0.55&#8197;cm3/cm3) at 298&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar, yielding the second highest C2H2/C2H4 uptake ratio of 63.6 up to now. One&#8208;step C2H4 production from a binary mixture of C2H2/C2H4 and a ternary mixture of C2H2/CO2/C2H4 at 298&#8197;K was achieved and verified by dynamic breakthrough experiments. Coupled with excellent thermal and water stability, F&#8722;PYMO&#8722;Cu could be a promising candidate for industrial C2 separation tasks.

         <title>Electrostatic Interactions Leading to Hierarchical Interpenetrating Electroconductive Networks in Silicon Anodes for Fast Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 36, Page 9320-9327, June 25, 2021. </description>

Still going strong: A three&#8208;dimensional interpenetrating conductive framework composed of carbon nanotubes and MXene has been created through simple electrostatic self&#8208;assembly. It can connect silicon nanoparticles in series, thereby realizing rapid lithium&#8208;ion transmission of the electrodes. Moreover, the compound shows excellent cycle stability and a stable reversible capacity.







Abstract
Recently, the frequency of combining MXene, which has unique properties such as metal&#8208;level conductivity and large specific surface area, with silicon to achieve excellent electrochemical performance has increased considerably. There is no doubt that the introduction of MXene can improve the conductivity of silicon and the cycling stability of electrodes after elaborate structure design. However, most exhaustive contacts can only improve the electrode conductivity on the plane. Herein, a MXene@Si/CNTs (HIEN&#8208;MSC) composite with hierarchical interpenetrating electroconductive networks has been synthesized by electrostatic self&#8208;assembly. In this process, the CNTs are first combined with silicon nanoparticles and then assembled with MXene nanosheets. Inserting CNTs into silicon nanoparticles can not only reduce the latter&#8216;s agglomeration, but also immobilizes them on the three&#8208;dimensional conductive framework composed of CNTs and MXene nanosheets. Therefore, the HIEN&#8208;MSC electrode shows superior rate performance (high reversible capacity of 280&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8722;1 even tested at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), cycling stability (stable reversible capacity of 547&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and applicability (a high reversible capacity of 101&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 50 cycles when assembled with NCM622 into a full cell). These results may provide new insights for other electrodes with excellent rate performance and long&#8208;cycle stability.

         <title>An Ultrastable Crystalline Acylhydrazone&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Framework for Efficient Removal of Organic Micropollutants from Water</title>

A new strategy for the synthesis of ultra&#8208;stable acylhydrazone&#8208;linked COFs through reinforcing the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions between the adjacent layers with increased &#960;&#8208;surface is reported. It is surprising to found that the produced material exhibits extremely chemical stability in harsh environments, and could be used to effectively capture various organic micropollutants from water such as antibiotic and plastic components.







Abstract
As an important member of crystalline porous polymers, acylhydrazone&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have gained much attention in recent years. However, the low structural stability imparts a limit on their practical applications. To tackle this problem, we report a simple strategy to increase the chemical stability of acylhydrazone&#8208;linked COFs by incorporating azobenzene groups in the conjugated framework. Through reinforcing the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions between the adjacent layers with increased &#960;&#8208;surface, it is surprising to find that the resulting materials exhibit extreme stability in harsh environments, such as in strong acid, strong base, aqueous educing agent and boiling water, even exposed to air for one year. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, such frameworks have been used to remove various organic micropollutants such as antibiotics, plastic components, endocrine disruptors, and carcinogens from water with high capacity, fast speed and excellent reusability over a wide pH range at environmentally relevant concentrations. The results provide a new avenue to significantly enhance the stability of COFs for practical applications.

         <title>Nucleophilic Reactions of Osmanaphthalynes with PMe3 and H2O</title>

         <dc:description>
New classes of osmium complexes bearing different substituents have been synthesized in a one&#8208;pot method comprising ligand substitution and nucleophilic addition of osmanaphthalynes. Aided by DFT calculations, the possible mechanism of this experiment is discussed. Moreover, all the target complexes have been fully characterized by NMR spectroscopy, HRMS and elemental analysis.







Abstract
Members of a new class of complexes, 2(CF3), 2(H), 2(Br), 2(I), and 2(OCH3), have been synthesized in a one&#8208;pot method involving the treatment of osmanaphthalynes bearing corresponding substituents (1(CF3), 1(H), 1(Br), 1(I), and 1(OCH3)) with trimethylphosphine (PMe3) and water. The main reaction process involves two steps, namely a ligand&#8208;exchange with trimethylphosphine and nucleophilic addition of water to the Os&#8801;C bond of the osmanaphthalyne. The substituents have a significant influence on the rate of the reaction, as befits a nucleophilic addition. Fortunately, the key intermediate [1(OCH3)]&#8242; could be successfully captured, and the detailed reaction mechanism has been explored with the aid of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which were in excellent agreement with the experimental findings. All of the target complexes have been fully characterized by 1H, 31P{1H}, and 13C{1H} NMR spectroscopy, high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry, and elemental analysis.

         <title>Chiral Chromium Salen@rGO as Multipurpose and Recyclable Heterogeneous Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 36, Page 9454-9460, June 25, 2021. </description>

A pyrene&#8208;tagged Cr&#8208;salen complex immobilized by &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions at rGO surface delivers a robust, reusable, heterogeneous catalyst that is efficient in several asymmetric catalytic reactions. Highly enantioenriched compounds were produced and various valuable scalemic compounds were easily isolated in their pure form even when the catalyst was engaged in a multisubstrate procedure.







Abstract
The first immobilization of a pyrene&#8208;tagged chromium salen complex through &#960;&#8208;&#960; noncovalent interactions on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is described. A very robust supported catalytic system is obtained to promote asymmetric catalysis in repeated cycles, without loss of activity or enantioselectivity. This specific behavior was demonstrated in two different catalytic reactions (up to ten reuses) promoted by chromium salen complexes, the cyclohexene oxide ring&#8208;opening reaction and the hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder cycloaddition between various aldehydes and Danishefsky's diene. Furthermore, the chiral chromium salen@rGO has been found to be compatible with a multi&#8208;substrate type use, in which the structure of the substrate involved is modified each time the catalyst is reused.

         <title>Scalable Production of Ambient Stable Hybrid Bismuth&#8208;Based Materials: AACVD of Phenethylammonium Bismuth Iodide Films**

         <dc:description>
Compact and stable bismuth halide&#8208;based hybrid material thin films were grown using aerosol&#8208;assisted chemical vapor deposition. The dependence of structural and optoelectronic properties of phenethylammonium bismuth iodide films were evaluated on varying substrates, deposition temperatures and curing conditions. The morphology and optical band&#8208;bending effects were related to synthetic parameters, and crack&#8208;free films were obtained with high moisture resistance.







Abstract
Large homogeneous and adherent coatings of phenethylammonium bismuth iodide were produced using the cost&#8208;effective and scalable aerosol&#8208;assisted chemical vapor deposition (AACVD) methodology. The film morphology was found to depend on the deposition conditions and substrates, resulting in different optical properties to those reported from their spin&#8208;coated counterparts. Optoelectronic characterization revealed band bending effects occurring between the hybrid material and semiconducting substrates (TiO2 and FTO) due to heterojunction formation, and the optical bandgap of the hybrid material was calculated from UV&#8208;visible and PL spectrometry to be 2.05&#8197;eV. Maximum values for hydrophobicity and crystallographic preferential orientation were observed for films deposited on FTO/glass substrates, closely followed by values from films deposited on TiO2/glass substrates.

         <title>Reversible Vapochromic Luminescence Accompanied by Planar Half&#8208;Chair Conformational Change of a Propeller&#8208;Shaped Boron &#946;&#8208;Diketiminate Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 36, Page 9302-9312, June 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A propeller&#8208;shaped boron &#946;&#8208;diketiminate complex exhibits a reversible color change of fluorescence originating from pseudopolymorphism. The emission color rapidly changes from green to blue when its pure crystals are exposed to an appropriate group of volatile organic compounds and vice versa. Such luminescent color changes are derived from crystal&#8211;crystal transitions accompanied by the planar&#8208;to&#8208;half&#8208;chair conformational changes of the complex. The small energy differences between the conformers of the complex can afford this pseudopolymorphic behavior.







Abstract
Leakage of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is one of the most severe industrial problems, because it can cause environmental pollution, global warming, fire, and explosion. Hence, the visualization of leakage is an essential technology to detect it at an early stage. Molecular crystals, fluorescence color of which can be changed by the exposure to VOCs could potentially serve as the sensing materials for realizing rapid and facile VOC detection. However, these materials usually require harsh conditions, such as heating or a vacuum, to recover their initial phases for reuse. Therefore, it remains a challenge to obtain completely reversible sensing systems without such energy&#8208;consuming recycling processes. Herein, the reversible color change of fluorescence from the crystals of a propeller&#8208;shaped boron &#946;&#8208;diketiminate complex is reported. The complex was crystallized in distinct crystalline phases having different luminescent colors. Importantly, these phases were interconverted very rapidly (time constant &lt;60&#8197;s) and repeatedly upon exposure to the vapors of the appropriate VOCs. The small energy differences between conformers of the complex could lead to this pseudopolymorphic behavior. This finding could be applied for the development of further eco&#8208;friendly reversible sensing materials based on four&#8208;coordinated boron complexes.

Hence, the visualization of leakage is an essential technology to detect it at an early stage. Molecular crystals, fluorescence color of which can be changed by the exposure to VOCs could potentially serve as the sensing materials for realizing rapid and facile VOC detection. However, these materials usually require harsh conditions, such as heating or a vacuum, to recover their initial phases for reuse. Therefore, it remains a challenge to obtain completely reversible sensing systems without such energy-consuming recycling processes. Herein, the reversible color change of fluorescence from the crystals of a propeller-shaped boron &#946;-diketiminate complex is reported. The complex was crystallized in distinct crystalline phases having different luminescent colors. Importantly, these phases were interconverted very rapidly (time constant &amp;lt;60&#8197;s) and repeatedly upon exposure to the vapors of the appropriate VOCs. The small energy differences between conformers of the complex could lead to this pseudopolymorphic behavior. This finding could be applied for the development of further eco-friendly reversible sensing materials based on four-coordinated boron complexes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Trifaceted Mickey Mouse Amphiphiles for Programmable Self&#8208;Assembly, DNA Complexation and Organ&#8208;Selective Gene Delivery</title>

Mickey Mouse molecular nanoparticles with a trehalose&#8208;based cyclooligosaccharide core and uneven distributions of cationic (C, red lobules) and lipophilic patches (L, blue lobules) co&#8208;assemble with plasmid DNA (pDNA, orange chains) to afford transfectious nanacomplexes with programmable topologies and internal structures, ranging from multilamellar spheroids and rods to core&#8208;shell arrangements, translating into amazing cell efficiencies in&#8197;vitro and organ selectivities in&#8197;vivo with no need of targeting labels.







Abstract
Instilling segregated cationic and lipophilic domains with an angular disposition in a trehalose&#8208;based trifaceted macrocyclic scaffold allows engineering patchy molecular nanoparticles leveraging directional interactions that emulate those controlling self&#8208;assembling processes in viral capsids. The resulting trilobular amphiphilic derivatives, featuring a Mickey Mouse architecture, can electrostatically interact with plasmid DNA (pDNA) and further engage in hydrophobic contacts to promote condensation into transfectious nanocomplexes. Notably, the topology and internal structure of the cyclooligosaccharide/pDNA co&#8208;assemblies can be molded by fine&#8208;tuning the valency and characteristics of the cationic and lipophilic patches, which strongly impacts the transfection efficacy in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. Outstanding organ selectivities can then be programmed with no need of incorporating a biorecognizable motif in the formulation. The results provide a versatile strategy for the construction of fully synthetic and perfectly monodisperse nonviral gene delivery systems uniquely suited for optimization schemes by making cyclooligosaccharide patchiness the focus.

The diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective synthesis of a configurationally stable S&#8208;shaped double azahelicene&#8208;like molecule showing good chiroptical responses has been achieved with the high ee value of 89&#8201;% by the rhodium(I)/xyl&#8208;segphos&#8208;complex&#8208;catalyzed double [2+2+2] cycloaddition of a dicyanotetrayne.







Abstract
The enantioselective synthesis of aza[6] and [7]helicene&#8208;like molecules have been achieved by the cationic rhodium(I)/axially chiral biaryl bisphosphine complex&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition of cyanodiynes. This protocol was successfully applied to the diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective synthesis of an S&#8208;shaped double aza[6]helicene&#8208;like molecule with a high ee value of 89&#8201;%. Although no epimerization and racemization were observed in the double carbo[6]helicene&#8208;like molecule at 80&#8201;&#176;C, epimerization and racemization of the double aza[6]helicene&#8208;like molecule proceeded at 80&#8201;&#176;C. This double aza[6]helicene&#8208;like molecule showed good fluorescent quantum yields and chiroptical responses under both neutral and acidic conditions.

         <title>Hydrogel&#8208;Stiffening and Non&#8208;Cell Adhesive Properties of Amphiphilic Peptides with Central Alkylene Chains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 36, Page 9295-9301, June 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive study on the amphiphilic peptides revealed unexpected effects of inserting an alkylene chain at the center on strengthening &#946;&#8208;sheet hydrogen bonds, providing stiffened hydrogels and diminishing cell adhesion property, which are clearly different from the effects of putting an alkyl tail at an end. This finding offers a novel molecular design to tune mechanical and biological functionalities of peptide materials.







Abstract
Amphiphilic peptides bearing terminal alkyl tails form supramolecular nanofibers that are increasingly used as biomaterials with multiple functionalities. Insertion of alkylene chains in peptides can be designed as another type of amphiphilic peptide, yet the influence of the internal alkylene chains on self&#8208;assembly and biological properties remains poorly defined. Unlike the terminal alkyl tails, the internal alkylene chains can affect not only the hydrophobicity but also the flexibility and packing of the peptides. Herein, we demonstrate the supramolecular and biological effects of the central alkylene chain length inserted in a peptide. Insertion of the alkylene chain at the center of the peptide allowed for strengthened &#946;&#8208;sheet hydrogen bonds and modulation of the packing order, and consequently the amphiphilic peptide bearing C2 alkylene chain formed a hydrogel with the highest stiffness. Interestingly, the amphiphilic peptides bearing internal alkylene chains longer than C2 showed a diminished cell&#8208;adhesive property. This study offers a novel molecular design to tune mechanical and biological properties of peptide materials.

         <title>Frontispiece: Organic Positive Materials for Magnesium Batteries: A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 36, June 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnesium (Mg) is one of the popular elements on the earth which is more abundance, cheaper and safer for the users than lithium metal. In the combination with organic compounds (carbonyl&#8208;, nitrogen&#8208;, and sulfur&#8208;based materials) as positive electrodes, the electrochemical system can be considered as a member of green chemistry. Moreover, this review will play a small role in reducing the environmental impact of the energy storage sector by avoiding the use of heavy metals or toxic elements. For more information, see the Review by N. A. Tran et&#8197;al. on page 9198.

         <title>Frontispiece: Chiral Gold(III) Complexes: Synthesis, Structure, and Potential Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 36, June 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Since two decades, tremendous progresses were made in gold chemistry. Most of them relate to the +I oxidation state which provides stable complexes with catalytic and pharmaceutical properties. Despite a more challenging chemistry, gold(III) complexes have recently attracted more and more attention as potential surrogates of gold(I) complexes. This is particularly true in the field of enantioselective catalysis, where the gold(III) complexes are expected to provide better asymmetric inductions. Read more about the syntheses and the applications of all well&#8208;defined chiral gold(III) complexes described during the last fifteen years in the Minireview by A. Blanc, P. de&#8197;Fr&#233;mont et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;9218&#8197;ff.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Since two decades&lt;/b&gt;, tremendous progresses were made in gold chemistry. Most of them relate to the +I oxidation state which provides stable complexes with catalytic and pharmaceutical properties. Despite a more challenging chemistry, gold(III) complexes have recently attracted more and more attention as potential surrogates of gold(I) complexes. This is particularly true in the field of enantioselective catalysis, where the gold(III) complexes are expected to provide better asymmetric inductions. Read more about the syntheses and the applications of all well-defined chiral gold(III) complexes described during the last fifteen years in the Minireview by A. Blanc, P. de&#8197;Fr&#233;mont et&#8197;al. on &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202100415"&gt;page&#8197;9218&#8197;ff&lt;/a&gt;.

         <title>Cover Feature: A Nazarov&#8208;Ene Tandem Reaction for the Stereoselective Construction of Spiro Compounds (Chem. Eur. J. 36/2021)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 36, Page 9196-9196, June 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem Nazarov/ene reaction in trienones was found to be initiated by tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (TPPB) and resulted in spiro compounds as single diastereoisomers. The reaction was applied to a set of substrates with different chain lengths and functionalities, and investigations on the mechanism were conducted. This novel diastereoselective reaction extends the application of interrupted Nazarov cyclizations as tools for the synthesis of natural products. More information can be found in the Communication by M. Kalesse et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101041).

         <title>Cover Feature: Exploiting Transient Radical Cations as Br&#248;nsted Acids for Allylic C&#8211;H Heteroarylation of Enol Silyl Ethers (Chem. Eur. J. 36/2021)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 36, Page 9195-9195, June 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction pathways of transient radical species are difficult to control, like the soap bubbles in the wind depicted in the cover image. Yet, these short&#8208;lived intermediates, when one encounters another, readily assemble into a united structure, as two bubbles fuse into a bigger single bubble. The enol silyl ether&#8208;derived radical cations with a highly acidic allylic proton facilitates the single&#8208;electron reduction of cyanopyridines via protonation. The resulting two radical intermediates successively engage in the radical&#8722;radical coupling to produce heteroarylated enol silyl ethers. More information can be found in the Communication by T. Ooi et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101352).

A vapochromic luminescent crystal consisting of boron diiminate has been discovered. The emission color is changed by absorption of solvent vapor, such as dichloromethane and recovered by desorption of encapsulated molecules through fuming with another solvent vapor, such as cyclohexane. The alteration of molecular conformation between planar and twisted structures is responsible for luminochromism. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K. Tanaka et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101107).

Fiber&#8208;forming peptides are of high interest for potential biomedical applications. This work presents the unexpected effects of central alkylene chains in peptides on their self&#8208;assembly and biological properties. Insertion of the alkylene chain at the center of the peptide allowed for strengthening of &#946;&#8208;sheet hydrogen bonds, formation of hydrogels with increased stiffness, thermal responses and significant decrease in the cell adhesive property. This study offers a novel molecular design to tune mechanical and biological properties of peptide materials by conformational flexibility.

This minireview summarizes the design and synthesis challenges of porous WO3 including how the different synthesis methods affect its properties, morphology and application in different fields, such as supercapacitors, catalysts, sensors, and therapeutics. The porous tungsten oxide with thorough porous channels provides abundant active sites for surface reactions.







Abstract
Tungsten oxide (WO3) has received ever more attention and has been highly researched over the last decade due to its being a low&#8208;cost transition metal semiconductor with tunable, yet widely stable, band gaps. This minireview briefly highlights the challenges in the design and synthesis of porous WO3 including methods, precursors, solvent effects, crystal phases, and surface activities of the porous WO3 base material. These topics are explored while also drawing a connection of how the morphology and crystal phase affect the band gap. The shifts in band gap not only impact the optical properties of tungsten but also allow tuning to operate on different energy levels, which makes WO3 highly desirable in many applications such as supercapacitors, batteries, solar cells, catalysts, sensors, smart windows, and bioapplications.

         <title>Organic Positive Materials for Magnesium Batteries: A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 36, Page 9198-9217, June 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mg cell is one of the promising candidate to replace to Li&#8208;ion batteries thanks to its advantages such as more abundance, cheaper and most importantly, the safety for the users. Positive electrode study is an important field in its development. Not only inorganic materials, but also the organic positive electrode research remains a major challenge to its potential use. Therefore, in this review, studies on organic positive electrodes in Mg batteries so far will be generalized.







Abstract
Magnesium batteries, like lithium&#8208;ion batteries, with higher abundance and similar efficiency, have drawn great interest for large&#8208;scale applications such as electric vehicles, grid energy storage and many more. On the other hand, the use of organic electrode materials allows high energy&#8208;performance, metal&#8208;free, environmentally friendly, versatile, lightweight, and economically efficient magnesium storage devices. In particular, the structural diversity and the simple activity of organic molecules make redox properties, and hence battery efficiency, easy to monitor. While organic magnesium batteries still in their infancy, this field becomes more and more promising because significant results were reported. To summarize the achievements in studies on organic cathodes for magnesium systems, their synthesis is discussed, combined with electrode design to provide the basis for controlling the electrochemical properties. Moreover, the techniques to synthesize organic materials with high&#8208;yield are mentioned. Finally, potential problems and prospects are explored to further improve organic cathodes.

         <title>Chiral Gold(III) Complexes: Synthesis, Structure, and Potential Applications</title>

Golden story: Recent progresses achieved in the synthesis of well&#8208;defined chiral gold(III) complexes have been summarized. Applications that encompass homogeneous catalysis, medicinal and material chemistry, are also described.







Abstract
Since the beginning of the 2000&#8217;s, homogeneous gold catalysis has emerged as a powerful tool to promote the cyclization of unsaturated substrates with excellent regioselectivity allowing the synthesis of elaborated organic scaffolds. An important goal to achieve in gold catalysis is the possibility to induce enantioselective transformations by the assistance of chiral complexes. Unfortunately, the linear geometry of coordination for gold usually encountered in complexes at the +1 oxidation states renders this goal very challenging. In consequence, the interest toward the synthesis of chiral gold(III) complexes is steadily growing. Indeed, the square planar geometry of the gold(III) cation appears more suitable to promote chiral induction. Beside catalysis, gold(III) complexes have also shown promising potential in the field of pharmacology. Herein, syntheses and applications of well&#8208;defined gold(III) complexes reported over the last fifteen years are summarized.

         <title>Exploiting Transient Radical Cations as Br&#248;nsted Acids for Allylic C&#8211;H Heteroarylation of Enol Silyl Ethers</title>

The transient radical cations, generated through single&#8208;electron oxidation of enol silyl ethers by the excited Ir&#8208;based photocatalyst, can be exploited as Br&#248;nsted acids for the activation of cyanopyridines. The protonation allows facile single&#8208;electron reduction of the cyanopyridinium to generate radical intermediates and concomitantly converts the radical cations into nucleophilic allylic radicals to be engaged in the radical&#8208;radical coupling to produce heteroarylated enol silyl ethers.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Low Pressure Carbonylation of Allylic Alcohols by Catalytic Anhydride Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 36, Page 9263-9266, June 25, 2021. </description>

A direct carbonylation of allylic alcohols is described for the first time with high catalyst activity at low pressure (10&#8197;bar). Key to high activities in the carbonylation is the finding that catalytic amounts of anhydride activate the substrate.







Abstract
A direct carbonylation of allylic alcohols has been realized for the first time with high catalyst activity at low pressure of CO (10&#8197;bar). The procedure is described in detail for the carbonylation of E&#8208;nerolidol, an important step in a new BASF&#8208;route to (&#8722;)&#8208;ambrox. Key to high activities in the allylic alcohol carbonylation is the finding that catalytic amounts of carboxylic anhydride activate the substrate and are constantly regenerated with carbon monoxide under the reaction conditions. The identified reaction conditions are transferrable to other substrates as well.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A direct carbonylation&lt;/b&gt; of allylic alcohols is described for the first time with high catalyst activity at low pressure (10&#8197;bar). Key to high activities in the carbonylation is the finding that catalytic amounts of anhydride activate the substrate.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A direct carbonylation of allylic alcohols has been realized for the first time with high catalyst activity at low pressure of CO (10&#8197;bar). The procedure is described in detail for the carbonylation of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;-nerolidol, an important step in a new BASF-route to (&#8722;)-ambrox. Key to high activities in the allylic alcohol carbonylation is the finding that catalytic amounts of carboxylic anhydride activate the substrate and are constantly regenerated with carbon monoxide under the reaction conditions. The identified reaction conditions are transferrable to other substrates as well.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Relay&#8208;Heck Cross&#8208;Coupling Between Alkenyl Halides and Unsaturated Alcohols in the Synthesis of Open&#8208;Chain Analogues of Musk Odorant Vulcanolide</title>

Unactivated alkenyl iodides and bromides underwent an unprecedented palladium&#8208;catalyzed relay&#8208;Heck cross&#8208;coupling with a wide range of alkenols. This methodology allowed for the preparation of open&#8208;chain analogues of the musk odorant Vulcanolide.







Abstract
Unactivated alkenyl iodides and bromides underwent an unprecedented palladium&#8208;catalyzed relay&#8208;Heck cross&#8208;coupling with a whole range of alkenols of different chain lengths linking the alkene and the alcohol, affording unsaturated aldehydes and ketones in moderate to good yields. In contrast, alkenyl triflates were not suitable partners for this reaction. This method allowed the preparation of open&#8208;chain analogues of the musk odorant Vulcanolide, several of which retained key olfactory properties of the parent molecule.

         <title>A Nazarov&#8208;Ene Tandem Reaction for the Stereoselective Construction of Spiro Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 36, Page 9257-9262, June 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigations on Lewis&#8208; and Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;mediated cyclizations of trienones revealed a novel Nazarov cyclization/ene reaction tandem reaction. This reaction allows the stereoselective construction of quaternary spirocenters, with a &#946;&#8208;hydroxyl group acting as superb stereodirecting element. The produced spirocycles possess useful functionality for further modifications, making them potentially valuable synthetic intermediates.







Abstract
The different reactivity of trienones under Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acids catalysis was investigated, resulting in distinct cyclization products and carbon backbones that originated either from a conjugate Prins cyclization or an interrupted Nazarov cyclization. In particular, an unprecedented Nazarov cyclization tandem reaction is presented, terminating the oxyallyl cation by an ene&#8208;type reaction, and leading stereoselectively to bicyclic spiro compounds. The terminal olefin of this motif represents a useful handle for further functionalization, making it a strategic intermediate in total syntheses. The tandem Nazarov/ene cyclization was shown to be preferred over a Nazarov/[3+2] tandem reaction for all our substrates, independent of chain length. Deuteration studies further support the mechanistic hypothesis of the terminating ene reaction.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Guanidine&#8208;Based Hybrid Perovskites with Strong Dichroism for Multiwavelength Polarization&#8208;Sensitive Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 36, Page 9267-9271, June 25, 2021. </description>

Two&#8208;dimensional hybrid perovskite, (BA)2(GA)Pb2I7, adopting the unique quantum&#8208;well structure, can be used for polarized&#8208;light detection. The polarization&#8208;sensitive detector based on (BA)2(GA)Pb2I7 single crystal achieves multiwavelength polarized&#8208;light detection with large dichroic ratios of &#8764;2.2, 1.29 and 1.23 for 520, 405 and 637&#8197;nm, respectively. This work shows that 2D hybrid perovskites hold great promise as materials for multiwavelength polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetection.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites, benefiting from their natural anisotropy of quantum&#8208;well motifs and optical properties, have shown remarkable polarization&#8208;dependent responses superior to the 3D counterparts. Here, for the first time, multiwavelength polarization&#8208;sensitive detectors were fabricated by using single crystals of a guanidine&#8208;based 2D hybrid perovskite, (BA)2(GA)Pb2I7 (where BA+ is n&#8208;butylammonium and GA+ is guanidium). Its unique 2D quantum&#8208;well structure results in strong crystallographic&#8208;dependence of optical absorption. Strikingly, our crystal&#8208;based photodetector exhibits a prominent photocurrent dichroic ratio (Imax/Imin) of &#8764;2.2 at 520&#8197;nm, higher than the typical 2D inorganic materials (GeSe, &#8764;1.09, PdSe2, &#8764;1.8). In addition, notable dichroic ratios of 1.29 and 1.23 at 405&#8197;nm and 637&#8197;nm are also created for the multiwavelength polarized&#8208;light detection. The prominent detecting performances, including low dark current (1.6&#215;10&#8722;11&#8197;A), considerable on/off ratio (&#8764;2&#215;103), high photodetectivity (&#8764;3.3&#215;1011 Jones) and responsivity (&#8764;12.01&#8197;mA&#8201;W&#8722;1), make (BA)2(GA)Pb2I7 a promising candidate for polarized&#8208;light detection. This work sheds light on the rational engineering of new 2D hybrid perovskites for the high&#8208;performance optoelectronic device applications.

         <title>Carbo&#8208;mer of Barrelene: A Rigid 3D&#8208;Carbon&#8208;Expanded Molecular Barrel</title>

After 1D (Z)&#8208;dimethylidynebutene, 2D benzene and 2D xylylene, carbo&#8208;meric expansion of 3D barrelene is envisaged. First examples of carbo&#8208;barrelenes have thus been obtained in 2&#8211;3 steps from classical substrates used for the synthesis of carbo&#8208;benzenes and carbo&#8208;xylylenes. Beyond experimental characterization by NMR/UV/Vis spectroscopy, voltammetry and crystallography, DFT&#8208;based theoretical analyses of carbo&#8208;barrelenes allow interpretation of their observed structural and electronic features and anticipation of their possible host capability toward ionic guests such as NH4+ or metallic ions.







Abstract
After extensive studies of 1D and 2D skeletal carbo&#8208;mers based on C8 &#960;&#8208;conjugating dialkynylbutatriene units (DABs: &#8764;C&#8801;C&#8722;(R)C=C=C=C(R)&#8722;C&#8801;C&#8764;) bridging sp or sp2 centers in carbo&#8208;butene, carbo&#8208;xylylene or carbo&#8208;benzene derivatives, 3D versions are envisaged through carbo&#8208;barrelenes and partially reduced derivatives thereof where two or three DAB blades span a bridge between sp3 carbinol vertices or ether thereof. For R=Ph, stable representatives were synthesized through a pivotal [6]pericyclynedione, and extensively characterized by spectroscopic, electrochemical and crystallographic methods. Density functional theory calculations allow detailed analysis of structural and electronic features of the 7&#8197;&#197; high C26 barrel&#8208;shaped molecules, and show that they can behave as cages for ionic species. Beyond aesthetical concerns, the results could open prospects of applications in host&#8208;guest supramolecular chemistry and single molecule charge transport.

Density functional theory calculations allow detailed analysis of structural and electronic features of the 7&#8197;&#197; high C&lt;sub&gt;26&lt;/sub&gt; barrel-shaped molecules, and show that they can behave as cages for ionic species. Beyond aesthetical concerns, the results could open prospects of applications in host-guest supramolecular chemistry and single molecule charge transport.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Synthesis of Stannylated Aryl Imines and Amines via Aryne Insertion Reactions into Sn&#8722;N Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 36, Page 9281-9285, June 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of valuable ortho&#8208;stannylated anilines via aryne &#963;&#8208;insertion into Sn&#8722;N bonds is reported. Readily prepared stannylated imines were identified as suitable N&#8722;Sn&#8208;donors, offering the possibility to modify both introduced substituents in follow up reactions using the rich Sn&#8208;chemistry and deprotection of the imine.







Abstract
The reaction of in&#8197;situ generated arynes with stannylated imines to provide ortho&#8208;stannyl&#8208;aniline derivatives is reported. The readily prepared trimethylstannyl benzophenone imine is introduced as an efficient reagent to realize the aryne &#963;&#8208;insertion reaction. The imine functionality is an established N&#8208;protecting group and insertions proceed with good yields and good to excellent regioselectivities. The product anilines are valuable starting materials for follow&#8208;up chemistry thanks to the rich chemistry offered by the trimethylstannyl moiety.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of 3&#8208;Substituted 3&#8208;Amino&#8208;2&#8208;oxindoles by Amination with Anilines</title>

         <dc:description>
A direct and efficient asymmetric synthesis of phenylamino&#8208;3&#8208;indolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones was realized by developing a chiral nickel complex catalytic system for the amination of 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;3&#8208;substituted oxindoles with anilines. A wide range of 3&#8208;aminooxindoles with 3&#8208;alkyl or 3&#8208;aryl substitution, including key intermediates of bioactive molecules, was created in excellent yield and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
A chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide&#8208;nickel(II) complex&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric amination of 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;3&#8208;substituted oxindoles with anilines has been developed. A series of alkyl or aryl 3&#8208;amino&#8208;indolinones with quaternary stereocenters were obtained in high yields with excellent ee values in one step (up to 99&#8201;% yield, up to 96&#8201;% ee). The method provided a ready route to optically active intermediates of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;oxindole&#8208;based bioactive compounds. Moreover, a possible transition&#8208;state model is proposed so as to elucidate the origin of the chirality based on the X&#8208;ray crystal structure of the catalyst and the adduct.

&#8220;In 2019, we reported characteristic properties, such as fiber bundling and hydrogel stiffening, of an amphiphilic peptide bearing a glycine residue at the center. With an increased interest in the effects of conformational flexibility, we synthesized a series of peptide variants with different central alkylene chain lengths in the present study to investigate their self&#8208;assembling and biological properties.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;9295&#8197;ff.

Horizontally oriented thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) emitters realizing high&#8208;performance sky&#8208;blue organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs) are reported in this work. The cover image represents that triphenyltriazine&#8208;based TADF emitters maximize the potential of sky&#8208;blue TADF OLEDs. The small structural differences in acceptor units makes a significant differences to device performance. More information can be found in the Full Paper by H. Sasabe, J. Kido et&#8197;al.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Horizontally oriented thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) emitters&lt;/b&gt; realizing high-performance sky-blue organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs) are reported in this work. The cover image represents that triphenyltriazine-based TADF emitters maximize the potential of sky-blue TADF OLEDs. The small structural differences in acceptor units makes a significant differences to device performance. More information can be found in the Full Paper by H. Sasabe, J. Kido et&#8197;al.

         <title>Suppressing Dehydroisomerization Boosts n&#8208;Butane Dehydrogenation with High Butadiene Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The addition of alkaline&#8208;earth metals into Pt&#8208;Ga2O3 catalyst can significantly suppress the dehydroisomerization and coke deposition during n&#8208;butane dehydrogenation, increase the Pt dispersity and stabilize Pt atoms at high temperature. Consequently, the optimal catalyst of 0.1Pt6Mg2Ga/S10 displays a n&#8208;butane conversion of 82.1&#8201;% at a butadiene selectivity of 34.7&#8201;% at 625&#8201;&#176;C, which has outperformed the reported catalysts for n&#8208;butane dehydrogenation.







Abstract
Butadiene (BD) is a critical raw material in chemical industry, which is conventionally produced from naphtha cracking. The fast&#8208;growing demand of BD and the limited oil reserve motivate chemists to develop alternative methods for BD production. Shale gas, which mainly consists of light alkanes, has been considered as cheap raw materials to replace oil for BD production via n&#8208;butane direct dehydrogenation (n&#8208;BDH). However, the quest for highly&#8208;efficient catalysts for n&#8208;BDH is driven by the current drawback of low BD selectivity. Here, we demonstrate a strategy for boosting the selectivity of BD by suppressing dehydroisomerization, an inevitable step in the conventional n&#8208;BDH process which largely reduces the selectivity of BD. Detailed investigations show that the addition of alkali&#8208;earth metals (e.&#8201;g., Mg and Ca) into Pt&#8208;Ga2O3/S10 catalysts increases Pt dispersity, suppresses coke deposition and dehydroisomerization, and thus leads to the significant increase of BD selectivity. The optimized catalyst displays an initial BD selectivity of 34.7&#8201;% at a n&#8208;butane conversion of 82.1&#8201;% at 625&#8201;&#176;C, which outperforms the reported catalysts in literatures. This work not only provides efficient catalysts for BD production via n&#8208;BDH, but also promotes the researches on catalyst design in heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule White&#8208;Light&#8208;Emitting Starburst Donor&#8208;Acceptor Triphenylamine Derivatives and Their Application as Ratiometric Luminescent Molecular Thermometers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From each his own: As the configuration of the central biphenyl breaks up any &#960;&#8208;conjugation, the triarylamine arms of these simple molecules retain their intrinsic electronic properties. This facilitates fluorescence from the individual subchromophoric units across the entire visible spectrum, generating white light. The excited&#8208;state process can be modulated by external stimuli such as temperature; thus, the compound could be exploited as molecular thermometers.







Abstract
White&#8208;light emission (WLE) from a single molecule is a highly desirable alternative to a complex mixture of complementary colour emitters, which suffers from poor stability and reproducibility for potential use in organic electronic devices and lighting applications. We report single&#8208;molecule WLE both in solution and thin films by judiciously controlled &#960;&#8208;electron delocalisation between the triarylamine subchromophoric units. Triphenylamine (TPA) forms the central core, and the phenyl rings are substituted with the electron&#8208;deficient acceptor 3&#8208;ethylrhodanine (Rh) and electron&#8208;rich donors triphenylamine or carbazole. The enforced biphenyl configuration of the TPA core and the other donors renders the &#960;&#8208;conjugation across the entire chromophore poor, thus the individual subchromophoric units retain their individual emission characteristics, which cover all three primary colour emissions, that is, red, green and blue (RGB). TPA&#8722;Rh units exhibit broad fluorescence in the green&#8208;red region originating from the local excited (LE) state and intramolecular charge transfer state (ICT), strongly influenced by the solvent, water, and temperature. Different fluorescence parameters, including spectral maxima, ratiometric changes in ICT emission at the expense of blue emission from terminal donor units, and changes in lifetime, have a linear relationship with temperature between 180&#8211;330&#8197;K, thus the molecules can function as a multiparameter luminescent molecular thermometer. A temperature coefficient of 0.19&#8197;K&#8722;1 in ratiometric fluorescence changes along with a spectral shift of 0.3&#8197;nm&#8201;K&#8722;1 and their workability over the wide temperature makes these molecules promising materials for potential applications. At lower temperatures, individual subchromophoric properties subside because of the reduced dihedral angle of biphenyl, and fluorescence from the whole molecule becomes dominant.

         <title>Inherent Ethyl Acetate Selectivity in a Trianglimine Molecular Solid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guided by crystal structure prediction, a &#8220;templating&#8221; strategy was used to construct selective binding sites in a trianglimine macrocycle crystal for ethyl acetate, an important chemical raw material and solvent. The resulting molecular crystals exhibit inherently high selectivity towards ethyl acetate, and hence can separate ethyl acetate from azeotropic mixtures with ethanol. The crystals show reasonable adsorption kinetics, good reliability after multiple adsorption cycles, and hold promise for practical separation or detection applications. More information can be found in the Full Paper by G.&#8197;M. Day, M. Liu, A.&#8197;I. Cooper, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101510).

         <title>An NHC&#8208;Stabilised Phosphinidene for Catalytic Formylation: A DFT&#8208;Guided Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing a low&#8208;valent phosphorus compound to the arena of catalysis: A N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;stabilised phosphinidene (1) was used for the activation of CO2. DFT calculations showed that the nucleophilicity of the phosphorus centre and a noncovalent &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction between the phenyl rings of phenylsilane and the catalyst synergistically drive the formylation of primary amides by CO2 under mild conditions.







Abstract
In recent years, the applications of low&#8208;valent main group compounds have gained momentum in the field of catalysis. Owing to the accessibility of two lone pairs of electrons, NHC&#8208;stabilised phosphinidenes have been found to be excellent Lewis bases; however, they cannot yet be used as catalysts. Herein, an NHC&#8208;stabilised phosphinidene, 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;(phenylphosphanylidene)&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H imidazole (1), for the activation of CO2 is reported.A closer inspection of the CO2 activation process by DFT calculations along with intrinsic bond orbital analysis shows that phosphinidene is associated with phenylsilane through a noncovalent &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction between two phenyl rings which activates the Si&#8722;H bond facilitating hydride transfer to the CO2 molecule. Detailed DFT studies along with spectroscopic experiments were combined to understand the mechanism of CO2 activation and its catalytic reductive functionalisation leading to the formylation of a range of chemically inert primary amides under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>The Construction of DNA Logic Gates Restricted to Certain Live Cells Based on the Structure Programmability and Aptamer&#8208;Cell Affinity of G&#8208;Quadruplexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By taking full advantage of the diversity and programmability of G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) structure topologies, we elaborately designed a whole set of DNA basic logic gates. More significantly, by further using the selective affinity between aptamer G4 and its targeted cancer cells, a spatially restricted cellular INHIBIT logic gate was successfully achieved, whose operational sites can be restricted to specific live cells.







Abstract
DNA computation is considered a fascinating alternative to silicon&#8208;based computers; it has evoked substantial attention and made rapid advances. Besides realizing versatile functions, implementing spatiotemporal control of logic operations, especially at the cellular level, is also of great significance to the development of DNA computation. However, developing simple and efficient methods to restrict DNA logic gates performing in live cells is still a challenge. In this work, a series of DNA logic gates was designed by taking full advantage of the diversity and programmability of the G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) structure. More importantly, by further using the high affinity and specific endocytosis of cells to aptamer G4, an INHIBIT logic gate has been realized whose operational site is precisely restricted to specific live cells. The design strategy might have great potential in the field of molecular computation and smart bio&#8208;applications.

         <title>Dianthracenylazatrioxa[8]circulene: Synthesis, Characterization and Application in OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Let there be light: A &#960;&#8208;extended, fully conjugated antiaromatic azatrioxa[8]circulene&#8208;polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) structure has been prepared, fully characterized and used in as the emitter in brightly emitting organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), inverted organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (IOLEDs) and quantum light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs).







Abstract
A soluble, green&#8208;blue fluorescent, &#960;&#8208;extended azatrioxa[8]circulene was synthesized by oxidative condensation of a 3,6&#8208;dihydroxycarbazole and 1,4&#8208;anthraquinone by using benzofuran scaffolding. This is the first circulene to incorporate anthracene within its carbon framework. Solvent&#8208;dependent fluorescence and bright green electroluminescence accompanied by excimer emission are the key optical properties of this material. The presence of sliding &#960;&#8208;stacked columns in the single crystal of dianthracenylazatrioxa[8]circulene is found to cause a very high electron&#8208;hopping rate, thus making this material a promising n&#8208;type organic semiconductor with an electron mobility predicted to be around 2.26&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. The best organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) device based on the dianthracenylazatrioxa[8]circulene fluorescent emitter has a brightness of around 16&#8201;000&#8197;Cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 and an external quantum efficiency of 3.3&#8201;%. Quantum dot&#8208;based OLEDs were fabricated by using dianthracenylazatrioxa[8]circulene as a host matrix material.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Snapshot&#8221; trapping of multiple transient azolyllithiums via a halogen &#8216;dance&#8217; was realized in a batch reactor. This method allows selective generation of isomeric azolylzinc species from a single starting material using newly synthesized bench&#8208;stable zinc halide diamine complexes, leading to the divergent and stereoselective synthesis of functionalized azoles. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K. Okano et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101256).

         <title>Controlling Site&#8208;Directed RNA Editing by Chemically Induced Dimerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Various RNA&#8208;targeting approaches have been engineered to modify specific sites on endogenous transcripts, breaking new ground for a variety of basic research tools and promising clinical applications in the future. Here, we combine site&#8208;directed adenosine&#8208;to&#8208;inosine RNA editing with chemically induced dimerization. Specifically, we achieve tight and dose&#8208;dependent control of the editing reaction with gibberellic acid, and obtain editing yields up to 20 % and 44 % in the endogenous STAT1 and GAPDH transcript in cell culture. Furthermore, the disease&#8208;relevant MECP2 R106Q mutation was repaired with editing yields up to 42 %. The introduced principle will enable new applications where temporal or spatiotemporal control of an RNA&#8208;targeting mechanism is desired.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Resolution of Spin&#8208;Crossover Active Iron(II) [2x2] Grid Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral magnetic materials are proposed for applications in second&#8208;order non&#8208;linear optics, magneto&#8208;chiral dichroism, among others. Recently, we have reported a set of tetra&#8208;nuclear Fe(II) grid complex conformers with general formula C/S&#8208;[Fe  4  L  4  ]  8+  (L: 2,6&#8208;bis(6&#8208;(pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,5&#8208;dihydrobenzo[1,2&#8208;d:4,5&#8208;d']diimidazole). In the grid complexes, isomerism emerges from tautomerism and conformational isomerism of the ligand L, and the S&#8208;type grid complex is chiral, which originates from different non&#8208;centrosymmetric spatial organization of the trans type ligand around the Fe(II) center. However, the selective preparation of an enantiomerically pure grid complex in a controlled manner is difficult due to spontaneous self&#8208;assembly. To achieve the pre&#8208;synthesis programmable resolution of Fe(II) grid complexes, we designed and synthesized two novel intrinsically chiral ligands by appending chiral moieties to the parent ligand. The complexation of these chiral ligands with Fe(II) salt resulted in the formation of enantiomerically pure Fe(II) grid complexes, as unambiguously elucidated by CD and XRD studies. The enantiomeric complexes exhibited similar gradual and half&#8208;complete thermal and photo&#8208;induced SCO characteristics. The good agreement between the experimentally obtained and calculated CD spectra further supports the enantiomeric purity of the complexes and even the magnetic studies. The chiral resolution of Fe(II)&#8208; [2x2] grid complexes reported in this study, for the first time, might enable the fabrication of magneto&#8208;chiral molecular devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Application of the Redox&#8208;Transmetallation Procedure to Access Divalent Lanthanide and Alkaline&#8208;Earth NHC Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Divalent lanthanide and alkaline&#8208;earth complexes supported by  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands have been accessed by redox&#8208;transmetallation between air&#8208;stable NHC&#8211;AgI complexes and the corresponding metals. Using the small ligand 1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (IMe), two series of isostructural complexes were obtained: the tetra&#8208;NHC complexes [LnI  2  (IMe)  4  ] (Ln = Eu and Sm) and the bis&#8208;NHC complexes [MI  2  (IMe)  2  (THF)  2  ] (M = Yb, Ca and Sr). In the former, distortions in NHC coordination were found to originate from intermolecular repulsions in the solid state. Application of the redox&#8208;transmetallation strategy with the bulkier 1,3&#8208;dimesitylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (IMes) ligand yielded [SrI  2  (IMes)(THF)  3  ] while using a similar procedure with Ca metal led to [CaI  2  (THF)  4  ] and uncoordinated IMes. DFT calculations were performed to rationalise the selective formation of the bis&#8208;NHC adduct in [SrI  2  (IMe)  2  (THF)  2  ] and the tetra&#8208;NHC adduct in [SmI  2  (IMe)  4  ]. Since the results in the gas phase point towards preferential formation of the tetra&#8208;NHC complexes for both metal centres, the differences between both complexes are a result of solid&#8208;state effects such as slightly different packing forces.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Rechargeable magnesium battery attracts lots of attention because of its high safety and low cost compared to lithium battery, and it is needed to develop more efficient electrode materials. Although MgMn  2  O  4  is a promising material for the positive electrode in Mg rechargeable batteries, it usually exhibits poor cyclability. To improve the electrochemical behavior, we have prepared nanoparticles of MgMn  2&#8208;y  Fe  y  O  4  . The XRD results have confirmed that when Mn  3+  (Jahn&#8208;Teller ion) ions are replaced by Fe  3+  (non Jahn&#8208;Teller ion), the resulting MgMn  2&#8208;y  Fe  y  O  4  is a cubic phase. The structure and theoretical voltage are theoretically calculated by using the DFT method. The obtained samples have been chemically treated in acid solution for partial demagnesiation, and it is observed that the presence of iron inhibits the deinsertion of Mg through disproportionation and favors the exchange reaction. The electrochemical behavior in non&#8208;aqueous magnesium cells has been explored.</dc:description>

         <title>Promotion of Proton Conductivity by Encapsulation Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra in Metal&#8722;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A Zr&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOP) was self&#8208;assembled in a porous MOF host, DUT&#8208;68, successively to synthesize MOP&#8208;1@DUT&#8208;68. The MOP guest (MOP&#8208;1) has the size of  ca.  20 &#197; (diameter), lager than that of the square windows (pore sizes of &#8764;14 &#197;) of DUT&#8208;68 but smaller than that of the rhombicuboctahedral cage (27.7 &#197;), which makes that the migration and leaching of MOP&#8208;1 could be effectively prohibited if MOP&#8208;1 is encapsulated in the MOFs&#8217; cavities. The incorporation of MOP&#8208;1 makes the proton conductivity of MOP&#8208;1@DUT&#8208;68 reach 1.14 &#215; 10  &#8208;3  S cm  &#8208;1  (at 80&#176;C under 98% RH), which is three orders of magnitude higher than that of DUT&#8208;68. Compared with MOP&#8208;1&#204;DUT&#8208;68 which was synthesized by impregnation, MOP&#8208;1@DUT&#8208;68 are more prone to form faster proton&#8208;conduction pathways and thus provides higher proton conductivity.</dc:description>

         <title>A Disulfide Switch Providing Absolute Handedness Control in Double Helices via Conversion from the Antiparallel to Parallel Helical Pattern</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The double&#8208;helical array of the aromatic oligoamide sequences can be switched from the antiparallel to parallel pattern through the transformation of thiol to disulfide. This enhances the bias of helical handedness and results in absolute chirality control of the double helices. The handedness mediated process can be governed by the thiol&#8208;disulfide oxidation&#8208;reduction cycle, thereby switching the structural arrangement and the enhancement of chiral bias.







Abstract
A strategy to reversibly switch the parallel/antiparallel helical conformation of aromatic double helices through the formation/breakage of a disulfide bond is presented. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures, NMR, and circular dichroism spectroscopy demonstrate that the double helices with terminal thiol groups favor an antiparallel helical arrangement both in the solid state and in solution, while the P/M bias of helicity induced by chiral segments from another extremity of the sequence is weak in this structural motif. The antiparallel helices can be rearranged to parallel helices through the disulfide connection of the sequences. This change enhances the bias of helical handedness and results in absolute chirality control of the double helices. The handedness&#8208;mediated process can be governed by the oxidation&#8208;reduction cycle, thereby switching the structural arrangement and the enhancement of chiral bias. In addition, we find that the sequences can dimerize into an intermolecular double helix with the disulfide connection. And the helical handedness is also fully controlled due to the head&#8208;to&#8208;head structural motif.

         <title>Slow Magnetic Relaxation in Mono&#8208; and Bimetallic Lanthanide Tetraimido&#8208;Sulfate S(NtBu)42&#8722; Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first series of isomorphous lanthanide Gd to Er complexes containing the tetraimido sulfate ligand renders these compounds compelling to be investigated for their single&#8208;molecule magnet behaviour. The displayed Dy dimer shows slow magnetic relaxation at zero field. The monomeric Tb and Dy complexes show field&#8208;induced single&#8208;molecule magnet behaviour. The ligand holds great potential for higher blocking systems, that is, removal of chloride ions, lithium transmetalation and promotion of the magnetic communication between the metal ions.







Abstract
Lanthanide ions are particularly well&#8208;suited for the design of single&#8208;molecule magnets owing to their large unquenched orbital angular momentum and strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling that gives rise to high magnetic anisotropy. Such nanoscopic bar magnets can potentially revolutionize high&#8208;density information storage and processing technologies, if blocking temperatures can be increased substantially. Exploring non&#8208;classical ligand scaffolds with the aim to boost the barriers to spin&#8208;relaxation are prerequisite. Here, the synthesis, crystallographic and magnetic characterization of a series of each isomorphous mono&#8208; and dinuclear lanthanide (Ln=Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er) complexes comprising tetraimido sulfate ligands are presented. The dinuclear Dy complex [{(thf)2Li(NtBu)2S(tBuN)2DyCl2}2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;ClLi(thf)2] (1c) shows true signatures of single&#8208;molecule magnet behavior in the absence of a dc field. In addition, the mononuclear Dy and Tb complexes [{(thf)2Li(NtBu)2S(tBuN)2LnCl2(thf)2] (2b,c) show slow magnetic relaxation under applied dc fields.

         <title>Tris(pentafluoroethyl)silanol Derivatives and the Lewis Amphoteric Tris(pentafluoroethyl)silanolate Anion, [Si(C2F5)3O]&#8722;</title>

         <dc:description>
As perfluoroalkyl siloxanes and their congener species are virtually unknown, the oxidation of tris(pentafluoroethyl)silane, Si(C2F5)3H, with NO2 yielding tris(pentafluoroethyl)silanol 1 which readily condenses to hexakis(pentafluoroethyl)disiloxane is reported. Deprotonation of in&#8197;situ generated Si(C2F5)3OH leads to hexakis(pentafluoroethyl)disilanolate 3 showing the Lewis amphoteric character of [Si(C2F5)3O]&#8722;.







Abstract
While alkyl&#8208;substituted siloxanes are widely known, virtually nothing is known about perfluoroalkyl siloxanes and their congener species, the silanols and silanolates. We recently reported on the tris(pentafluoroethyl)silanide ion, [Si(C2F5)3]&#8722;, which features Lewis amphoteric character deriving from the pentafluoroethyl substituents and their strong electron&#8208;withdrawing properties. Transferring this knowledge, we investigated the Lewis amphoteric behavior of the tris(pentafluoroethyl)silanolate, [Si(C2F5)3O]&#8722;. In order to examine such Lewis amphoteric behavior, we first developed a strategy for the synthesis of the corresponding silanol Si(C2F5)3OH, which readily condenses at room temperature to the hexakis(pentafluoroethyl)disiloxane, (C2F5)3SiOSi(C2F5)3. Deprotonation of Si(C2F5)3OH employing a sterically demanding phosphazene base allows the characterization of the first example of a dimeric triorganosilanolate: the dianionic hexakis(pentafluoroethyl)disilanolate, [{Si(C2F5)3O}2]2&#8722;, implies Lewis amphoteric character of the monomeric [Si(C2F5)3O]&#8722; anion.

         <title>PorphyStruct: A Digital Tool for the Quantitative Assignment of Non&#8208;Planar Distortion Modes in Four&#8208;Membered Porphyrinoids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supersaddled copper corroles are a result of structural investigations towards non&#8208;planar distortion modes of porphyrinoids performed by the new digital tool PorphyStruct. The program introduces the technique of normal&#8208;mode structural decomposition (NSD) to porphyrinoids like the corroles, and while retaining the terminology of the NSD method, it is flexible with respect to the size and shape of the macrocycle perimeter.







Abstract
PorphyStruct, a new digital tool for the analysis of non&#8208;planar distortion modes of different porphyrinoids, and its application to corrole structures is reported. The program makes use of the normal&#8208;coordinate structure decomposition technique (NSD) and employs sets of normal modes equivalent to those established for porphyrins in order to describe the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane dislocation pattern of perimeter atoms from corroles, norcorroles, porphycenes and other porphyrinoids quantitatively and in analogy to the established terminology. A comparative study of 17 porphyrin structures shows very similar results to the original NSD analysis and no systematic error. Application to corroles is successful and reveals the necessity to implement an extended basis of normal modes for a large share of experimental structures. The results frequently show the concomitant occurence of several modes but remain interpretable. For group XI metal corroles the phenomenon of supersaddling was unravelled, allowing for more in&#8208;depths discussions of structure&#8208;function correlations.

         <title>Polyoxometalates&#8208;Based Semi&#8208;flexible Metal&#8208;Semiconductor Triboelectric Nanogenerators for Low Frequency and Small Amplitude Mechanical Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Six types of polyoxometalates (POMs) with different structures and compositions are firstly selected to modify the friction materials of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). The strong electron&#8208;accepting and storage capabilities of POMs can promote the transfer of electrons from semiconductors to metals, laying a foundation for the application of POMs in a new field. and providing a new method for increasing the electrical output of TENGs.







Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;cost durable triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) is essential for converting mechanical energy into electrical energy. Many organic polymer friction materials used widely have thermal stability problems, which makes TENGs with semiconductors as friction materials stand out. Here, we report a semi&#8208;flexible TENG based on metal and TiO2 modified by polyoxometalates (POMs) as pure inorganic friction materials. Six different POMs are firstly selected to modify the friction materials of TENGs, and the output performance of TENGs with different POMs&#8208;modified semiconductors and different metals as friction materials are tested. Compared with the unmodified TENGs, the open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of the optimal Ag&#8208;K6P2Mo18O62(P2Mo18)/TiO2 TENG device is increased by more than 4 times, which is mainly attributed to the strong electron&#8208;accepting and storage capabilities of POMs. This study has demonstrated that TENGs modified by POMs have potential application prospects and provided a new method for increasing the electrical output of TENGs.

         <title>BODIPYs with Photoactivatable Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoactivatable BODIPYs permit fluorescence switching with spatiotemporal control under the influence of optical stimulations. Their synthetic versatility further provides the opportunity to engineer the photochemical, photophysical and structural properties for the implementation of invaluable imaging strategies aimed at elucidating the structures and dynamics of biological samples. Specifically, these photoactivatable fluorophores allow the visualization of live cells with sub&#8208;diffraction resolution and the monitoring of dynamic events in live organisms.







Abstract
The borondipyrromethene (BODIPY) chromophore is a versatile platform for the construction of photoresponsive dyes with unique properties. Specifically, its covalent connection to a photocleavable group can be exploited to engineer compounds with photoswitchable fluorescence. The resulting photoactivatable fluorophores can increase their emission intensity or shift their emission wavelengths in response to switching. Such changes permit the spatiotemporal control of fluorescence with optical stimulations and the implementation of imaging strategies that would be impossible to replicate with conventional fluorophores. Indeed, BODIPYs with photoactivatable fluorescence enable the selective highlighting of intracellular targets, the nanoscaled visualization of sub&#8208;cellular components, the real&#8208;time monitoring of dynamic events and the photochemical writing of optical barcodes.

&lt;p&gt;This review highlights the recent achievements of iron- and cobalt-catalyzed enantioselective cross-couplings of halide derivatives with organometallic reagents for the construction of C-C bonds. Synthetic applications of enantioselective cross-couplings to natural products and biologically active compounds are also covered showing the power of these cross-couplings in organic synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Coinage Metal Complexes with Di&#8208;tertiary&#8208;butyl Sulfide as Precursors with Ultra&#8208;Low Decomposition Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple, but efficient: Inherent facile decomposition mechanism in the tBu2S ligand is exploited to obtain molecular precursors that decompose at low&#8208; or even room temperature to afford metal sulfide or metallic nanoparticles. Easily extendable to other systems, this strategy can be used to obtain metastable or compositionally complex nanomaterials with greater control and incorporate them in technologies that are sensitive to harsh conditions.







Abstract
We report here the synthesis of [Cu2(TFA)4(tBu2S)2] (1), [Ag4(TFA)4(tBu2S)4] (2) and [AuCl(tBu2S)] (3) (TFA=trifluoroacetate), which decompose in solution medium at ultra&#8208;low temperature (e.&#8201;g., in boiling toluene) to afford phase&#8208;pure and highly crystalline Cu9S5, Ag2S and metallic Au nanoparticles, respectively. The low decomposition temperature of these precursors is attributed to the facile decomposition mechanism in the di&#8208;tertiary&#8208;butyl sulfide ligand. These results are a significant step in the direction of establishing a general low&#8208;temperature strategy spanning a range of systems including thermodynamically metastable materials and incorporate them in technologies that are sensitive to the harsh conditions.

         <title>Relevance of &#960;&#8208;Backbonding for the Reactivity of Electrophilic Anions [B12X11]&#8722; (X=F, Cl, Br, I, CN)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The vibrational frequency of CO, which binds to different electrophilic anions [B12X11]&#8208; (X=F, Cl, Br, I), is determined by an interplay of blue&#8208;shifting electrostatics (blue beam between boron and carbon) and red shifting &#960;&#8208;backdonation (flames). For X=Cl, Br, I, (upper half) electrostatics dominates, while for X=F (bottom) &#960;&#8208;backdonation dominates and binds CO exceptionally strongly. Measured spectra are shown on the right. The band of unbound CO would be found at the position of the laser beam. More information can be found in the Full Paper by M. Mayer, J. Warneke, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100949).

         <title>Early Oxidative Transformations During the Biosynthesis of Terrein and Related Natural Products</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterologous expression of two related biosynthetic gene clusters from Aspergillus terreus and Roussoella sp. DLM33 confirmed a conserved flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenase that initiates the oxidative decarboxylation of the key intermediate (dichloro&#8208;) 6&#8208;hydroxymellein. Further in&#8197;vitro studies imply that both pathways diverge after this initial oxidation, whereas additional dehydration appears essential for downstream processing.







Abstract
The mycotoxin terrein is derived from the C10&#8208;precursor 6&#8208;hydroxymellein (6&#8208;HM) via an oxidative ring contraction. Although the corresponding biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) has been identified, details of the enzymatic oxidative transformations are lacking. Combining heterologous expression and in&#8197;vitro studies we show that the flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenase (FMO) TerC catalyzes the initial oxidative decarboxylation of 6&#8208;HM. The reactive intermediate is further hydroxylated by the second FMO TerD to yield a highly oxygenated aromatic species, but further reconstitution of the pathway was hampered. A related BGC was identified in the marine&#8208;derived Roussoella sp. DLM33 and confirmed by heterologous expression. These studies demonstrate that the biosynthetic pathways of terrein and related (polychlorinated) congeners diverge after oxidative decarboxylation of the lactone precursor that is catalyzed by a conserved FMO and further indicate that early dehydration of the side chain is an essential step.

         <title>Remodeling of the Fibrillation Pathway of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein by Interaction with Antimicrobial Peptide LL&#8208;III</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) has emerged as a key mechanism for intracellular organization, and many recent studies have provided important insights into the role of LLPS in cell biology. There is also evidence that LLPS is associated with a variety of medical conditions, including neurodegenerative disorders. Pathological aggregation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein, which is causally linked to Parkinson&#8217;s disease, can proceed via droplet condensation, which then gradually transitions to the amyloid state. We show that the antimicrobial peptide LL&#8208;III is able to interact with both monomers and condensates of a&#8208;synuclein, leading to stabilization of the droplet and preventing conversion to the fibrillar state. The anti&#8208;aggregation activity of LL&#8208;III was also confirmed in a cellular model. We anticipate that studying the interaction of antimicrobial&#8208;type peptides with liquid condensates such as a&#8208;synuclein will contribute to the understanding of disease mechanisms (that arise in such condensates) and may also open up exciting new avenues for intervention.</dc:description>

         <title>The Stronger the Better: Donor Substituents Push Catalytic Activity of Molecular Chromium Olefin Polymerization Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic activity in ethylene polymerization with single&#8208;site organochromium complexes increases with number and donor strength of substituents. The new systems allow the formation of ultra&#8208;high molecular weight polyethylene with highest productivity and high co&#8208;monomer incorporation. An almost linear correlation between ligand donor strength and polymerization activity is observed.







Abstract
The donor strength of bifunctional pyridine&#8208;cyclopentadienyl ligands was altered systematically by the introduction of donating groups in the para&#8208;position of the pyridine. In the resulting chromium complexes an almost linear correlation between donor strength and the nitrogen&#8208;chromium distance as well as the electronic absorption maximum is experimentally observed. The connection of electron&#8208;donating groups in the ligand backbone leads to an efficient transfer of the electronic influences to the catalytically active metal centre without restricting it through steric effects. Therefore, catalytic olefin polymerization activity, which is already very high for the previously studied catalysts, increase considerably by attaching para&#8208;amino groups to the chelating pyridine or quinoline, respectively. Combining electron&#8208;rich indenyl ligands with para&#8208;amino substituted pyridines lead to the highest catalytic activities observed so far for this class of organo chromium olefin polymerisation catalysts. The resulting polymers are of ultra&#8208;high molecular weight and the ability of the catalysts to incorporate co&#8208;monomers is also very high.

         <title>Molecular Cage Assembly by Sn&#8722;O&#8722;Sn Bridging of Di&#8208;, Tri&#8208; and Tetranuclear Organotin Tectons: Extending the Spacing in Double Ladder Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In an alternative approach to metal&#8208;containing cage assemblies, air&#8208;stable di&#8208;, tri&#8208; and tetranuclear organotin compounds were explored in a combined experimental and theoretical approach for the synthesis of hexa&#8208; and octanuclear metal cages based on halide&#8208;oxide (hydrolysis) reactions at the metal centres. Among these, there are two novel bis(tetraorganodistannoxanes) showing double&#8208;ladder&#8208;type structures with record of head&#8208;to&#8208;toe dimensions. From this contribution, multiple options for future development in different directions arise.







Abstract
Hydrolysis reactions of di&#8208; and trinuclear organotin halides yielded large novel cage compounds containing Sn&#8722;O&#8722;Sn bridges. The molecular structures of two octanuclear tetraorganodistannoxanes showing double&#8208;ladder motifs, viz., [{Me3SiCH2(Cl)SnCH2YCH2Sn(OH)CH2SiMe3}2(&#956;&#8208;O)2]2 [1, Y=p&#8208;(Me)2SiC6H4&#8208;C6H4Si(Me)2] and [{Me3SiCH2(I)SnCH2YCH2Sn(OH)CH2SiMe3}2(&#956;&#8208;O)2]2&#8901;0.48&#8201;I2 [2&#8901;0.48&#8201;I2, Y=p&#8208;(Me)2SiC6H4&#8208;C6H4Si(Me)2], and the hexanuclear cage&#8208;compound 1,3,6&#8208;C6H3(p&#8208;C6H4Si(Me)2CH2Sn(R)2OSn(R)2CH2Si(Me)2C6H4&#8208;p)3C6H3&#8208;1,3,6 (3, R=CH2SiMe3) are reported. Of these, the co&#8208;crystal 2&#8901;0.48&#8201;I2 exhibits the largest spacing of 16.7&#8197;&#197; reported to date for distannoxane&#8208;based double ladders. DFT calculations for the hexanuclear cage and a related octanuclear congener accompany the experimental work.

         <title>Bench&#8208;Stable Electrophilic Fluorinating Reagents for Highly Selective Mono&#8208; and Difluorination of Silyl Enol Ethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bench&#8208;stable electrophilic fluorinating reagents [N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI) analogues] were synthesized by using F2 gas. Reagents obtained by replacing one of the NFSI sulfonyl groups with an acyl group led to the highly selective monofluorination of silyl enol ethers. Reagents bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents at NFSI benzenesulfonyl groups efficiently facilitated the difluorination.







Abstract
Efficient methods for the synthesis of fluorinated compounds have been intensively studied, recently. Development of practical fluorinating reagents is indispensable for this purpose. Herein, bench&#8208;stable electrophilic fluorinating reagents were synthesized as N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI) substitutes. Reagents obtained by replacing one of the NFSI sulfonyl groups with an acyl group led to the highly selective monofluorination of silyl enol ethers with suppression of undesired overreaction, that is, difluorination. On the other hand, reagents bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents at NFSI benzenesulfonyl groups efficiently facilitated the difluorination of silyl enol ethers under base&#8208;free conditions. Thus, both mono&#8208; and difluorinated target materials were prepared from the same substrate.

         <title>Infrared Responsive Choline Phosphate Lipids for Cancer Synergistic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Choline phosphate lipids have been designed and developed as new generation zwitterionic nanocarriers with excellent biocompatibility and bioorthogonality to provide more programmable performance for cancer therapy. However, there is a lack of spatiotemporal and reversible control for drug release at target tumor cells, which may lead to severe adverse effects to normal tissue and discounted treatment outcome. Here, we developed a light&#8208;inducible Lip&#8208;cRGDfk/ICG/Dox liposomes for synergistic cancer therapy. ICG can effectively convert light energy into achieve selective heating in a local environment upon laser irradiation, thus to induce the thermal ablation of tumor cells, and further reversibly trigger the spatiotemporal release of anticancer drugs (Dox) at tumor cells due to the conformation transformation of CP lipids to synergistically kill tumor cells. We also demonstrate the Lip&#8208;cRGDfk/ICG/Dox exhibited significant improvement for breast cancer therapy in vitro and in vivo, which can serve as an efficient platform to noninvasively and spatiotemporally control cytotoxicity activation at tumor cells for precision cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>How Science Can Contribute to the Remedial Conservation of Cultural Heritage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our society needs resilience to stand against social and environmental challenges. Cultural heritage assets are crucial as they foster socio&#8208;economical improvements; however, they are threatened by degradation. We summarize here some of the most valuable solutions science has provided to systematically tackle degradation and re&#8208;valorize our cultural patrimony, overcoming the serendipitous approach of past conservation practices.







Abstract
Colloid science is contributing solutions to counteract the degradation of artifacts, favoring their transfer to future generations. Advanced materials such as nanoparticles, coatings, gels and microemulsions have been assessed in conservation, spanning from archeological sites to modern and contemporary art. We give an overview of the fundamental milestones and latest innovations in conservation science, targeting solutions and tools for remedial conservation based on green nanomaterials and hybrid systems. Future perspectives and outstanding challenges in this exciting field are then outlined.

         <title>Bulky Barbiturates as Non&#8208;toxic Ionic Dye Insulators for Enhanced Emission in Polymeric Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bulky hydrophobic counterions (weakly coordinating anions) can insulate ionic dyes against aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) and enable preparation of highly fluorescent dye&#8208;loaded nanoparticles (NPs) for bioimaging, biosensing and light harvesting. Here, we introduce a family of hydrophobic anions based on fluorinated C &#8208;acyl barbiturates with delocalized negative charge and bulky non&#8208;polar groups. Similarly to fluorinated tetraphenylborates, these barbiturates prevent ACQ of cationic dye alkyl rhodamine B inside polymer NPs made of biodegradable poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) (PLGA). Their efficiency to prevent ACQ increases for analogues with higher acidity and bulkiness. Their structure controls dye&#8208;dye communication, yielding bright NPs with on/off switching or stable emission. They enhance dye encapsulation inside NPs, allowing intracellular imaging without dye leakage. Compared to fluorinated tetraphenylborates known as cytotoxic transmembrane ion transporters, the barbiturates display a significantly lower cytotoxicity. These chemically available and versatile barbiturate derivatives are promising counterion scaffolds for preparation of bright non&#8208;toxic fluorescent nanomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Redox Neutral Direct C&#8208;H Amination of Glycine Derivatives and Peptides with N&#8208;Acyloxyphthalimides</title>

         <dc:description>Abstract: Abstract

A room temperature, visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted and redox neutral direct C&#8208;H amination of glycine and peptides has been firstly accomplished by using  N  &#8208;acyloxyphthalimide or &#8208;succinimide as nitrogen&#8208;radical precursor. The present strategy provides ways to introduce functionalities such as  N  &#8208;acyloxyphthalimide or &#8208;succinimide specifically to terminal glycine segment of peptides. Herein, mild conditions and high functional&#8208;group tolerance allow the preparation of non&#8208;natural &#945;&#8208;amino acids and modification of corresponding peptides in this way.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Several boron compounds with 2&#8208;(imidazo[1,5&#8208;  a  ]pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)phenols, differentiated by the nature of the substituent (R) in the para position of the hydroxy group, have been synthesized and thoroughly characterized both in solution (  1  H,  13  C,  11  B,  19  F NMR) and in the solid state (X&#8208;ray). All derivatives displayed attractive photophysical properties like very high Stokes shift, high fluorescence quantum yields and a good photostability in solution. Time&#8208;Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations allowed to define the main electronic transitions as intra ligand transitions (  1  ILT), which was corroborated by the Natural Transition Orbitals (NTOs) shapes. The homo&#8208;lumo energy gap was correlated to the electronic properties of the substituent R on the phenolic ring, as quantified by its &#963;  p  Hammett constant.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Iod(az)olium Salts &#8211; Potent Halogen&#8208;Bond Donors in Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This article describes the application of  N  &#8208;heterocyclic iod(az)olium salts (NHISs) as highly reactive organocatalysts. A variety of mono&#8208; and dicationic NHISs are described and utilized as potent XB&#8208;donors in halogen&#8208;bond catalysis. They were benchmarked in seven diverse test reactions in which the activation of carbon&#8208; and metal&#8208;chloride bonds as well as carbonyl and nitro groups was achieved.  N  &#8208;Methylated dicationic NHISs rendered the highest reactivity in all investigated catalytic applications with reactivities even higher than all previously described monodentate XB&#8208;donors based on iodine(I) and (III) and the strong Lewis acid BF  3  .</dc:description>

         <title>Glycol Chitosan Functionalized with a Gd(III) Chelate as a Redox&#8208;responsive Magnetic Resonance Imaging Probe to Label Cell Embedding Alginate Capsules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One possibility for the non&#8208;invasive imaging of encapsulated cell grafts is to label the lumen of cell embedding capsules with a redox&#8208;responsive probe, as an increased extracellular reducing potential can be considered as a marker of hypoxia&#8208;induced necrosis. A Gd(III)&#8208;HPDO3A&#8208;like chelate has been conjugated to glycol&#8208;chitosan through a redox&#8208;responsive disulphide bond to obtain a contrast agent for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Such a compound can be interspersed with fibroblasts within the lumen of alginate&#8208;chitosan capsules. Increasing reducing conditions within the extracellular microenvironment lead to the reductive cleavage of the disulphide bond and to the release of gadolinium in the form of a low molecular weight, non&#8208;ionic chelate. The efflux of such chelate from capsules is readily detected by a decrease of contrast enhancement in T  1  &#8208;weighted MR images.</dc:description>

         <title>"Zn bridge" Effect Toward Consecutively Tunable Retention Characteristic For Volatile Random Access Memory</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyimide memory materials with D&#8208;A structure based on charge transfer mechanism exhibit great potential for next generation of information storage technology due to its outstanding high&#8208;temperature resistance, well dimensional and chemical stability. It is one of core challenges in this field to precisely control memory performance by limited chemical decoration. Most of reported work mainly focus on designing novel and elaborate electron donors or acceptors for expected memory behaviour of polyimides, which take a lot of time and is not always efficacious. Herein, we reported a series of porphyrinated copolyimides coPI&#8208;Znx (x=5, 10, 20, 50, 80), where x represents the mole percentage of Zn ion in central core of porphyrin. Experimental and theoretical analysis indicate that the Zn ion could play a vital bridge role in promoting the formation and stabilization of charge transfer complex by enhancing the hybridization of local and charge transfer (HLCT) excitations of porphyrinated polyimides, endowing coPI&#8208;Znx with volatile random access memory performance and continuously tunable retention time. This work could provide one simple strategy to precisely regulate memory performance via only altering the metal content in porphyrinated polyimides</dc:description>

         <title>Engineered cyclotides with potent broad in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The search for novel antimicrobial agents to combat microbial pathogens is intensifying in response to bioterrorism and rapid drug resistance development to current antibiotic therapeutics. Respiratory failure and septicemia are the leading causes of mortality among hospitalized patients. Here, we report the development of a novel engineered cyclotide with effective broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial activity against several ESKAPE bacterial strains and clinical isolates. The most active antibacterial cyclotide was extremely stable in serum, showed little hemolytic activity and provided protection in vivo in a murine model of P. aeruginosa peritonitis. These results highlight the potential of the cyclotide scaffold for the development of novel antimicrobial therapeutic leads for the treatment of bacteremia.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Visualization of Substitutional Li Doping in Supported Pt Nanoparticles and Their Ultra&#8208;selective Catalytic Hydrogenation Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It has only recently been established that doping light elements (lithium, boron, and carbon) into supported transition metals can fill interstitial sites, which can be observed by the expanded unit cell. As an example, interstitial lithium (intLi) can block H filling octahedral interstices of palladium metal lattice, which improves partial hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes under hydrogen. In contrast, herein, we report intLi is not found in the case of Pt/C. Instead, we observe for the first time a direct &#8216;substitution&#8217; of Pt with substitutional lithium (subLi) in alternating atomic columns using scanning transmission electron microscopy&#8208;annular dark field (STEM&#8208;ADF). This ordered substitutional doping results in a contraction of the unit cell as shown by high&#8208;quality synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction (SXRD). The electron donation of d&#8208;band of Pt without higher orbital hybridizations by subLi offers an alternative way for ultra&#8208;selectivity in catalytic hydrogenation of carbonyl compounds by suppressing the facile CO bond breakage that would form alcohols.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterometallic d8&#8211;d10 Coupling of Rh(I) and M(0) (M=Pd, Pt) in a Sandwich Framework of p&#960;&#8208;Conjugated Ligands</title>

Outside the norm: The low&#8208;valent heterometallic pair, d8 RhI and d10 M0 (M=Pd, Pt), undergoes unusual coupling through Rh&#8722;M bond formation in the sandwich framework of cycloheptatriene. The molecular orbital analysis showed that Rh&#8722;M d&#963; bond (M=Pd, Pt) is formed in a (d&#8211;d)18 electron system through the back&#8208;donating interaction.







Abstract
A heterometallic M&#8722;M&#8242; bond formation is a key to construct atomically precise bimetallic clusters and materials. However, it is sometimes not straightforward to construct a heterometallic M&#8722;M&#8242; bond through conventional methods including redox condensation. Here, we found that a sandwich framework of &#960;&#8208;conjugated unsaturated hydrocarbon ligands provides a unique coordination environment that facilitates unusual coupling of d8 RhI and d10 M0 (M=Pd, Pt). The molecular orbital analysis showed that the electron&#8208;accepting ability of the sandwich framework through back&#8208;donation allows the formation of a d&#963;&#8208;type Rh&#8722;Pd bond in a (d&#8211;d)18 electron system.

         <title>Construction of Stable Helical Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks with a Conformationally Rigid &#8220;Concave Ligand&#8221;</title>

         <dc:description>
Concave concept: A helical metal&#8211;organic framework was prepared by using conformationally rigid tetratopic benzoic acid ligands with binding units pointing toward each other. To avoid intramolecular interactions between binding units, matching spacing groups were applied to introduce atropic repulsion, thus forming extended frameworks. With this new ligand design, a helical MOF with significantly improved air and moisture stability was prepared, thereby providing a new strategy for ligand design for the construction of porous materials.







Abstract
A helical metal&#8208;organic framework was prepared by using a conformationally rigid tetratopic benzoic acid ligand with binding units pointing toward each other (concave ligand). To avoid the obvious intramolecular interactions between binding units, matching spacing groups were applied to introduce atropic repulsion, thereby allowing the formation of extended frameworks for the first time. With this new ligand design, a helical&#8208;shaped MOF with significantly improved air and moisture stability was successfully prepared, thus providing a new strategy for ligand design toward porous material constructions.

         <title>Modulating the Acidic and Basic Site Concentration of Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Derivatives to Promote the Carbon Dioxide Epoxidation Reaction</title>

PCN&#8208;244&#8722;ZnCo1 was successfully synthesized and then pyrolyzed to the target product PCN&#8208;224&#8722;ZnCo1&#8208;950 at 950&#8201;&#176;C. The physical structure of PCN&#8208;224&#8722;ZnCo1&#8208;950 did not change much, as judged by SEM and N2 adsorption and desorption. Due to the volatilization of Zn, PCN&#8208;224&#8722;ZnCo1&#8208;950 has greatly improved basicity and suitable acidic/alkaline site concentration compared to the precursor. It can be efficiently used to carbon dioxide absorption and catalyze the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) is an ideal precursor/template for porous carbon, and its active components are uniformly doped, which can be used in energy storage and catalytic conversion fields. Metal&#8208;organic framework PCN&#8208;224 with carboxylporphyrin as the ligand was synthesized, and then Zn2+ and Co2+ ions were coordinated in the center of the porphyrin ring by post&#8208;modification. Here, PCN&#8208;224&#8722;ZnCo with different ratios of bimetallic Zn2+/Co2+ ions were used as the precursor, and the metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon(M&#8722;N&#8722;C) material of PCN&#8208;224&#8722;ZnCo&#8208;950 was obtained by pyrolyzing the precursor at 950&#8201;&#176;C in Ar. Because Zn is easy to volatilize at 950&#8201;&#176;C, the formed M&#8722;N&#8722;C materials can reflect different Co contents and different basic site concentrations. The formed material still maintains the original basic framework. With the increase of Zn2+/Co2+ ratio in precursor, the concentration of N&#8208;containing alkaline sites in pyrolysis products gradually increase. Compared with the precursor, PCN&#8208;224&#8722;ZnCo1&#8208;950 with Zn2+/Co2+=1&#8201;:&#8201;1 has greatly improved basicity and suitable acidic/ alkaline site concentration. It can be efficiently used to carbon dioxide absorption and catalyze the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxide. More importantly, the current method of adjusting the acidic/basic sites in M&#8722;N&#8722;C materials through volatilization of volatile metals can provide an effective strategy for adjusting the catalysis of MOF derivatives with porphyrin structure.

         <title>Stabilisation of [WVF4]+ by N&#8208; and P&#8208;Donor Ligands: Second&#8208;Order Jahn&#8208;Teller Effects in Octacoordinate d1 Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The [WVF4]+ cation has been stabilised by C5H5N and P(CH3)3 in [O3SCF3]&#8722; salts. The cations adopt square&#8208;antiprismatic (SA) geometries in the solid state, instead of trigonal dodecahedra (TD), as determined using a new geometry index, &#964;8, to discern octacoordinate geometries. This preference for SA was revealed by DFT (B3LYP) studies to arise from a favourable second&#8208;order Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion upon occupation of the 
 orbital on tungsten.







Abstract
The first isolated examples of cationic fluoridotungsten(V) complexes are reported as octacoordinate [WF4(L)4]+ (L=C5H5N, P(CH3)3). The [WF4(NC5H5)4]+ cation is synthesised as its [O3SCF3]&#8722; salt upon reaction of WF5(NC5H5)2 with [(CH3)3Si(NC5H5)][O3SCF3] in excess C5H5N, whereas [WF4{P(CH3)3}4]+ is accessed directly from WF6 upon reaction with (CH3)3SiO3SCF3 and excess P(CH3)3. These salts were characterised by X&#8208;ray crystallography and Raman spectroscopy in the solid state. New geometry indices for octacoordinate complexes (&#964;8 and &#964;8&#8242;) are introduced, allowing for the facile differentiation of trigonal&#8208;dodecahedral (TD) and square&#8208;antiprismatic (SA) geometries. This has disambiguated the SA geometries of [WF4(L)4]+ and the geometries of a series of previously reported d0 and d1 MA4B4 complexes. Computational (DFT&#8722;B3LYP) studies of [WF4(PH3)4]2+/+ and related model systems demonstrate the occurrence of a second&#8208;order Jahn&#8208;Teller (SOJT) distortion from TD in d0 complexes to SA in d1 complexes, with the degree of SOJT stabilisation being most significant in 5d complexes containing fluorido ligands and monodentate neutral donors.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The [W&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cation&lt;/b&gt; has been stabilised by C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;N and P(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in [O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; salts. The cations adopt square-antiprismatic (SA) geometries in the solid state, instead of trigonal dodecahedra (TD), as determined using a new geometry index, &#964;&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, to discern octacoordinate geometries. This preference for SA was revealed by DFT (B3LYP) studies to arise from a favourable second-order Jahn-Teller distortion upon occupation of the 
 orbital on tungsten.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first isolated examples of cationic fluoridotungsten(V) complexes are reported as octacoordinate [WF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(L)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (L=C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;N, P(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). The [WF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(NC&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cation is synthesised as its [O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; salt upon reaction of WF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(NC&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with [(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si(NC&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)][O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] in excess C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;N, whereas [WF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;{P(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is accessed directly from WF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; upon reaction with (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and excess P(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. These salts were characterised by X-ray crystallography and Raman spectroscopy in the solid state. New geometry indices for octacoordinate complexes (&#964;&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; and &#964;&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;&#8242;) are introduced, allowing for the facile differentiation of trigonal-dodecahedral (TD) and square-antiprismatic (SA) geometries. This has disambiguated the SA geometries of [WF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(L)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and the geometries of a series of previously reported d&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; and d&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; MA&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; complexes. Computational (DFT&#8722;B3LYP) studies of [WF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(PH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+/+&lt;/sup&gt; and related model systems demonstrate the occurrence of a second-order Jahn-Teller (SOJT) distortion from TD in d&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; complexes to SA in d&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; complexes, with the degree of SOJT stabilisation being most significant in 5d complexes containing fluorido ligands and monodentate neutral donors.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Mapping the Electronic Structure and the Reactivity Trends for Stabilized &#945;&#8208;Boryl Carbanions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemistry of stabilized &#945;&#8208;boryl carbanions show a remarkable diversity, and can enable many different synthetic routes towards efficient C&#8208;C bond formation. The electron&#8208;deficient, trivalent boron center stabilizes the carbanion facilitating its generation and tunning its reactivity. Here, we describe the electronic structure and the reactivity trends of a large dataset of &#945;&#8208;boryl carbanions. We use DFT&#8208;derived parameters for capturing their electronic and steric properties, computational reactivity towards model substrates, and crystallographic analysis within the Cambridge Structural Dataset. This study maps the reactivity space by systematically varying the nature of the boryl moiety, the substituents of the carbanionic carbon, the number of &#945;&#8208;boryl motifs, and the metal counteraction. In general, the free carbanionic intermediates are described as borata&#8208;alkene species with C&#8208;B &#960; interaction polarized towards the carbon. Furthermore, we can classify the &#945;&#8208;boryl alkylidene metal precursors into three classes directly related to their reactivity: 1) nucleophilic borata&#8208;alkene salts with alkali and alkali&#8208;earth metals, 2) nucleophilic &#951;  2  &#8208;(C&#8208;B) borata&#8208;alkene complexes with early transition metals, Cu and Ag, and 3) &#945;&#8208;boryl alkyl complexes with late transition metals. This trend map aids the selection of the appropriate reactive synthon depending on the sought reactivity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C6&#8208;selective dehydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling of 2&#8208;pyridones with thiophenes was developed for the synthesis of 6&#8208;thiophenyl pyridin&#8208;2(1  H  )&#8208;one derivatives. In this reaction, the excellent site selectivity was controlled by the 2&#8208;pyridyl directing group on the nitrogen of the pyridone ring. Control experiments indicated that the  N  &#8208;pyridyl was essential for the transformation. To the best of our knowledge, this procedure is the first successful example on the direct C&#8208;6 heteroarylation of 2&#8208;pyridones with electron rich thiophene derivatives. 4&#8208;Pyridone was also used as substrate to generate the corresponding C2 heteroarylated product. Moreover, this pyridyl directing group was readily removable to generate the biheteroaryl structures with a free N&#8208;H group.</dc:description>

         <title>Systematic Access of Ternary Organotetrel&#8208;Copper Chalcogenide Clusters by [PhTE3]3&#8722; Anions (T=Si, Sn; E=S, Se)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clusters of the type [(CuPPh2Ph)6(PhTE3)2] (T=Si, Sn; E=S, Se) and [(CuPPh3)6(PhSnSe3)3Cu3SnSe] were formed in reactions of Na3[PhTE3] with [Cu(PPh3)3Cl]. The larger cluster based on T/E=Sn/Se clearly followed upon partial degradation of the [PhSnSe3]3&#8722; subunit and exhibited a new cluster archetype with idealized C3v symmetry. Quantum chemical studies served to shed light on the bonding situation in these clusters and to rationalize the optical absorption properties measured by solid&#8208;state UV/Vis absorption spectra.







Abstract
Fragmentation reactions of organotetrel chalcogenide heteroadamantane&#8208;type clusters [(PhT)4E6] (T/E=Si/S (1); Si/Se; Sn/S, and Sn/Se) by addition of the corresponding sodium chalcogenide gave salts of the general formula Na3[PhTE3], with T/E=Si/S (2); Si/Se (3); Sn/S (A); Sn/Se (4). Reaction of these salts with [Cu(PPh3)3Cl] gave a series of organotetrel&#8211;copper chalcogenide clusters [(CuPPh3)6(PhTE3)2] with T/E=Si/S; (5), Si/Se (6), Sn/S (7) and Sn/Se (8). Compounds 5&#8211;8 share a common structural motif with two intact {PhTE3} units coordinating a Cu6 moiety, which was previously reported with other ligands, and for the Sn and Ge congeners only. If the Sn/Se reaction system was allowed to crystallize more slowly, single crystals of compound [(CuPPh3)6(PhSnSe3)3Cu3SnSe] (9) were obtained, which are based on a larger cluster structure. Hence, 9 might form from 8 through incorporation of additional cluster fragments. The experimentally and quantum chemically determined optical properties were compared to related clusters.

&lt;p&gt;Fragmentation reactions of organotetrel chalcogenide heteroadamantane-type clusters [(PhT)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] (T/E=Si/S (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;); Si/Se; Sn/S, and Sn/Se) by addition of the corresponding sodium chalcogenide gave salts of the general formula Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[PhTE&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;], with T/E=Si/S (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;); Si/Se (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;); Sn/S (&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;); Sn/Se (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;). Reaction of these salts with [Cu(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl] gave a series of organotetrel&#8211;copper chalcogenide clusters [(CuPPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(PhTE&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] with T/E=Si/S; (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;), Si/Se (&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;), Sn/S (&lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;) and Sn/Se (&lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt;). Compounds &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt; share a common structural motif with two intact {PhTE&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;} units coordinating a Cu&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; moiety, which was previously reported with other ligands, and for the Sn and Ge congeners only. If the Sn/Se reaction system was allowed to crystallize more slowly, single crystals of compound [(CuPPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(PhSnSe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SnSe] (&lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt;) were obtained, which are based on a larger cluster structure. Hence, &lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt; might form from &lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt; through incorporation of additional cluster fragments. The experimentally and quantum chemically determined optical properties were compared to related clusters.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Photo&#8208;Initiated Cobalt Catalyzed Radical Olefin Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Outer&#8208;sphere radical hydrogenation of olefins proceeds via stepwise hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) from transition metal hydride species to the substrate. Typical catalysts exhibit M&#8211;H bonds that are either too weak to efficiently activate H  2  &#160;or too strong to reduce unactivated olefins. This contribution evaluates an alternative approach, that starts from a square&#8208;planar cobalt(II) hydride complex. Photoactivation results in Co&#8211;H bond homolysis. The three&#8208;coordinate cobalt(I) photoproduct binds H  2  &#160;to give a dihydrogen complex, which is a strong hydrogen atom donor, enabling the stepwise hydrogenation of both styrenes and unactivated aliphatic olefins with H  2  &#160;via HAT.</dc:description>

Under gentle heating conditions in NaOAc/AcOH, brominated lactol silyl ethers were selectively converted to 4&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;naphthoates &#8208; a naphthalene scaffold with a fully substituted benzene unit. The present reaction including a 1,2&#8208;aryl migration process was successfully applied to construct a wide range of polycyclic systems including biphenyl, anthracene, and benzothiophene structures. In addition, the 4&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;naphthoate products showed bright photoluminescence emmission from solid&#8208;state as well as in several organic solvents.

         <title>Preparation of Butadienylpyridines by Iridium&#8208;NHC&#8208;Catalyzed Alkyne Hydroalkenylation and Quinolizine Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magic watchmaker. The Ir&#8208;NHC catalyst efficiently hydroalkenylates alkynes with 2&#8208;vinylpyridine. The interplay of the NHC and acac ligands drives the reaction via IrIII intermediates allowing the selective formation of expected and unexpected butadienylpyridine derivatives. The unusual 5&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;butadienylpyridines result from a complex stepwise mechanism involving quinolizine intermediates.







Abstract

These complexes react with 2&#8208;vinylpyridine to afford the hydrido&#8208;iridium(III)&#8208;alkenyl cyclometalated derivatives IrH(&#954;2O,O&#8217;&#8208;BHetA)(&#954;2N,C&#8208;C7H6N)(IPr) through the iridium(I) intermediate Ir(&#954;2O,O&#8217;&#8208;BHetA)(IPr)(&#951;2&#8208;C7H7N). The cyclometalated IrH(&#954;2O,O&#8217;&#8208;acac)(&#954;2N,C&#8211;C7H6N)(IPr) complex efficiently catalyzes the hydroalkenylation of aromatic and aliphatic terminal alkynes and enynes with 2&#8208;vinylpyridine to afford 2&#8208;(4R&#8208;butadienyl)pyridines with Z,E configuration as the major reaction products (yield up to 89&#8201;%). In addition, unprecedented (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;butadienyl&#8208;5R&#8208;pyridine derivatives have been obtained as minor reaction products (yield up to 21&#8201;%) from the elusive 1Z,3gem&#8208;butadienyl hydroalkenylation products. These compounds undergo a thermal 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization to afford bicyclic 4H&#8208;quinolizine derivatives that, under catalytic reaction conditions, tautomerize to 6H&#8208;quinolizine to afford the (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;(butadienyl)&#8208;5R&#8208;pyridine by a retro&#8208;electrocyclization reaction.

         <title>Easy Access to Versatile Catalytic Systems for C&#8722;H Activation and Reductive Amination Based on Tetrahydrofluorenyl Rhodium(III) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile rhodium catalystfor the formation C&#8722;N and C&#8722;C bonds was synthesized based on easily available 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydrofluorene. The catalyst efficiently works for the reductive amination of carbonyl compounds via elimination of the tetrahydrofluorenyl ligand as well as for CH activation of aromatic compounds with the retention of this ligand.







Abstract
On the basis of the 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydrofluorenyl ligand, a simple approach was developed to new effective rhodium catalysts for the construction of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bonds. The halide compounds [(&#951;5&#8208;tetrahydrofluorenyl)RhX2]2 (2&#8201;a: X=Br; 2&#8201;b: X=I) were synthesized by treatment of the bis(ethylene) derivative (&#951;5&#8208;tetrahydrofluorenyl)Rh(C2H4)2 (1&#8201;a) with halogens. An analogous reaction of the cyclooctadiene complex (&#951;5&#8208;tetrahydrofluorenyl)Rh(cod) (1&#8201;b) with I2 is complicated by the side formation of [(cod)RhI]2. The reaction of 2&#8201;b with 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl leads to cation [(&#951;5&#8208;tetrahydrofluorenyl)Rh(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl)I]+ (3). The halide abstraction from 2&#8201;a,b with thallium or silver salts allowed us to prepare sandwich compounds with incoming cyclopentadienyl, dicarbollide and mesityleneligands [(&#951;5&#8208;tetrahydrofluorenyl)RhCp]+ (4), (&#951;5&#8208;tetrahydrofluorenyl)Rh(&#951;&#8208;7,8&#8208;C2B9H11) (5), and [(&#951;5&#8208;tetrahydrofluorenyl)Rh(&#951;&#8208;mesitylene)]2+ (6). The structures of 1&#8201;b, 2&#8201;b&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2I2, 3PF6, 4TlI4, 5, and [(cod)RhI]2 were determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Compounds 2&#8201;a,b efficiently catalyze the oxidative coupling of benzoic acids with alkynes to selectively give isocoumarins or naphthalenes, depending on the reaction temperature. Moreover, they showed moderate catalytic activity in other annulations of alkynes with aromatic compounds (such as benzamide, acetanilide, etc.) which proceed through CH activation. Compound 2&#8201;b also effectively catalyzes the reductive amination of aldehydes and ketones in the presence of carbon monoxide and water via water&#8208;gas shift reaction, giving amines in high yields (67&#8211;99&#8201;%).

The catalyst efficiently works for the reductive amination of carbonyl compounds via elimination of the tetrahydrofluorenyl ligand as well as for CH activation of aromatic compounds with the retention of this ligand.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the basis of the 1,2,3,4-tetrahydrofluorenyl ligand, a simple approach was developed to new effective rhodium catalysts for the construction of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bonds. The halide compounds [(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-tetrahydrofluorenyl)RhX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;2&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;: X=Br; &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;: X=I) were synthesized by treatment of the bis(ethylene) derivative (&#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-tetrahydrofluorenyl)Rh(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;) with halogens. An analogous reaction of the cyclooctadiene complex (&#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-tetrahydrofluorenyl)Rh(cod) (&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;) with I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is complicated by the side formation of [(cod)RhI]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The reaction of &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt; with 2,2&#8242;-bipyridyl leads to cation [(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-tetrahydrofluorenyl)Rh(2,2&#8242;-bipyridyl)I]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;). The halide abstraction from &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;,&lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt; with thallium or silver salts allowed us to prepare sandwich compounds with incoming cyclopentadienyl, dicarbollide and mesityleneligands [(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-tetrahydrofluorenyl)RhCp]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;), (&#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-tetrahydrofluorenyl)Rh(&#951;-7,8-C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;) (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;), and [(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-tetrahydrofluorenyl)Rh(&#951;-mesitylene)]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;). The structures of &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;TlI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;, and [(cod)RhI]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; were determined by X-ray diffraction. Compounds &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;,&lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt; efficiently catalyze the oxidative coupling of benzoic acids with alkynes to selectively give isocoumarins or naphthalenes, depending on the reaction temperature. Moreover, they showed moderate catalytic activity in other annulations of alkynes with aromatic compounds (such as benzamide, acetanilide, etc.) which proceed through CH activation. Compound &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt; also effectively catalyzes the reductive amination of aldehydes and ketones in the presence of carbon monoxide and water via water-gas shift reaction, giving amines in high yields (67&#8211;99&#8201;%).&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Anthrathiadiazole Derivatives: Synthesis, Physical Properties and Two&#8208;photon Absorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, by using a simple [4+2] cycloaddition reaction between a,a,a&#8217;,a&#8217;&#8208;tetrabromo o&#8208;xylenes derivatives and benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole&#8208;4,7&#8208;dione, the substituted anthrathiadiazoles with &#8722;Br, &#8722;CN, and &#8722;OCH3 groups could be easily constructed. The as&#8208;obtained compounds display the two&#8208;photon absorption, where their cross&#8208;section values are strongly affected by the nature, position and strength of the substituted groups.







Abstract
Anthrathiadiazole is a key synthon for the construction of large azaacenes, however, the attachment of different substituents onto the skeleton of anthrathiadiazole is difficult but highly desirable because it could be easy to enrich the structures of azaacenes. Here, it is demonstrated that anthrathiadiazole derivatives with &#8722;Br, &#8722;CN, and &#8722;OCH3 groups could be easily constructed through a simple [4+2] cycloaddition reaction between a,a,a&#8217;,a&#8217;&#8208;tetrabromo&#8208;o&#8208;xylenes derivatives and benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole&#8208;4,7&#8208;dione. The structures of the as&#8208;prepared compounds with different substituents were carefully characterized. Moreover, the basic physical properties of the as&#8208;prepared anthrathiadiazole derivatives were fully investigated, where the cyano&#8208;substituted derivative (BTH&#8208;CN) has the highest stability and the methoxy&#8208;substituted derivative (BTH&#8208;OCH3) is easy to be oxidized. Moreover, the two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) characteristics of different anthrathiadiazoles are also studied by using the femtosecond Z&#8208;scan technique. The results show that the fused anthrathiadiazole skeletons possess large TPA cross&#8208;section values &#948;2 in the range of 3000&#8211;5000&#8197;GM, where the nature, position and strength of the substituted groups have strong effect on these values.

         <title>Indium Tribromide&#8208;Catalysed Transfer&#8208;Hydrogenation: Expanding the Scope of the Hydrogenation and of the Regiodivergent DH or HD Addition to Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
More is better: The InBr3&#8208;catalysed transfer&#8208;hydrogenation from dihydroaromatic compounds to di&#8208; and trisubstituted alkenes was realised utilising cyclohexa&#8208;1,4&#8208;diene as H2 surrogate in chlorinated solvents, such as DCM and DCE. The scope of the reactions could be expanded towards electron&#8208;deficient aryl&#8208;substituted alkenes and even to a dialkyl&#8208;substituted alkene. The regiodivergent hydrodeuterogenation as well as the deuterohydrogenation were realised with two regiospecifically deuterium&#8208;labelled HD surrogates to access site selective deuterium incorporation in the products.







Abstract
The transfer&#8208;hydrogenation as well as the regioselective and regiodivergent addition of H&#8722;D from regiospecific deuterated dihydroaromatic compounds to a variety of 1,1&#8208;di&#8208; and trisubstituted alkenes was realised with InBr3 in dichloro(m)ethane. In comparison with the previously reported BF3&#8901;Et2O&#8208;catalysed process, electron&#8208;deficient aryl&#8208;substituents can be applied reliably and thereby several restrictions could be lifted, and new types of substrates could be transformed successfully in hydrodeuterogenation as well as deuterohydrogenation transfer&#8208;hydrogenation reactions.

         <title>&#8220;Snapshot&#8221; Trapping of Multiple Transient Azolyllithiums in Batch</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dancing partners: &#8220;Snapshot&#8221; trapping of multiple transient azolyllithiums in a halogen dance has been realized in a batch reactor. This method allows selective generation of isomeric azolylzinc species from a single starting material by using newly synthesized bench&#8208;stable zinc halide diamine complexes, leading to the divergent and stereoselective synthesis of functionalized azoles.







Abstract
Recent developments in flow microreactor technology have allowed the use of transient organolithium compounds that cannot be realized in a batch reactor. However, trapping the transient aryllithiums in a &#8220;halogen dance&#8221; is still challenging. Herein is reported the trapping of such short&#8208;lived azolyllithiums in a batch reactor by developing a finely tuned in&#8197;situ zincation using zinc halide diamine complexes. The reaction rate is controlled by the appropriate choice of diamine ligand. The reaction is operationally simple and can be performed at 0&#8201;&#176;C with high reproducibility on a multigram scale. This method was applicable to a wide range of brominated azoles allowing deprotonative functionalization, which was used for the concise divergent syntheses of both constitutional isomers of biologically active azoles.

High&#8208;yield synthesis: A mild palladium&#8208;catalysed Hiyama cross&#8208;coupling of 1&#8208;diisopropylsilyl&#8208;d&#8208;glucal with various (hetero)aryl halides has been developed. This arylation strategy enables the synthesis of a variety of (hetero)aryl pseudo&#8208;C&#8208;glucosides in good to excellent yields. Without the need for protecting groups, selected pseudo&#8208;C&#8208;glucosides were stereoselectively converted into the corresponding C&#8208;glucosides, as well as 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;C&#8208;glucosides. This methodology was applied to the efficient and high&#8208;yielding synthesis of dapagliflozin and its uncommon &#945;&#8208;isomer.







Abstract
Access to unprotected (hetero)aryl pseudo&#8208;C&#8208;glucosides via a mild Pd&#8208;catalysed Hiyama cross&#8208;coupling reaction of protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free 1&#8208;diisopropylsilyl&#8208;d&#8208;glucal with various (hetero)aryl halides has been developed.

This methodology was applied to the efficient and high&#8208;yielding synthesis of dapagliflozin, a medicament used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. Finally, the versatility of our methodology was proved by the synthesis of other analogues of dapagliflozin.

Without the need for protecting groups, selected pseudo-&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-glucosides were stereoselectively converted into the corresponding &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-glucosides, as well as 2-deoxy-&#946;-&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-glucosides. This methodology was applied to the efficient and high-yielding synthesis of dapagliflozin and its uncommon &#945;-isomer.

&lt;p&gt;Access to unprotected (hetero)aryl pseudo-&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-glucosides via a mild Pd-catalysed Hiyama cross-coupling reaction of protecting-group-free 1-diisopropylsilyl-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-glucal with various (hetero)aryl halides has been developed. In addition, selected unprotected pseudo-&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-glucosides were stereoselectively converted into the corresponding &#945;- and &#946;-&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-glucosides, as well as 2-deoxy-&#946;-&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-glucosides. This methodology was applied to the efficient and high-yielding synthesis of dapagliflozin, a medicament used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. Finally, the versatility of our methodology was proved by the synthesis of other analogues of dapagliflozin.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Rethinking Borole Cycloaddition Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New insights into the reactivity of perarylated boroles toward alkynes have been derived from both experimental and computational studies. It is shown that borepins (the formal alkyne insertion products) can readily isomerize to the thermodynamically more favorable boranorbornadienes (the formal Diels&#8208;Alder products), thus obscuring the mechanism of product formation (see Figure). In addition, the fluorescent nature of the tricyclic boracyclohexenes, the most stable isomers of the addition reactions, has been investigated by absorption and emission spectroscopy.







Abstract
Boroles are attracting broad interest for their myriad and diverse applications, including in synthesis, small molecule activation and functional materials. Their properties and reactivity are closely linked to the cyclic conjugated diene system, which has been shown to participate in cycloaddition reactions, such as the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with alkynes. The reaction steps leading to boranorbornadienes, borepins and tricyclic boracyclohexenes from the thermal reaction of boroles with alkynes are seemingly well understood as judged from the literature. Herein, we question the long&#8208;established mechanistic picture of pericyclic rearrangements by demonstrating that seven&#8208;membered borepins (i.&#8201;e., heptaphenylborepin and two derivatives substituted with a thienyl and chloride substituent on boron) exist in a dynamic equilibrium with the corresponding bicyclic boranorbornadienes, the direct Diels&#8208;Alder products, but are not isolable products from the reactions. Heating gradually converts the isomeric mixtures into fluorescent tricyclic boracyclohexenes, the most stable isomers in the series. Results from mechanistic DFT calculations reveal that the tricyclic compounds derive from the boranorbornadienes and not the borepins, which were previously believed to be intermediates in purely pericyclic processes.

         <title>Fine Tunable, Redox Active Octapalladium Chains Supported by Linear Tetraphosphines, Leading to Dynamically 1D Self&#8208;Assembled Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A family of Pd8 chains supported by meso&#8208;Ph2PCH2P(Ph)CH2P(Ph)CH2PPh2 (dpmppm), [Pd8(meso&#8208;dpmppm)4(L)2](BF4)4 (L = none (1), solvents (2), RNC (3)) and [Pd8(meso&#8208;dpmppm)4(X)2]&#173;(BF4)2 (4), were systematically synthesized by using 2a (L = CH3CN) as a good precursor. DFT calculations with and without empirically calculating dispersion force stabilization energy (D3) indicated that the formation energy of Pd8 chain from two Pd4 fragments is assumed to involve mainly noncovalent interactions with four sets of interligand C&#8211;H/p interactions and Pd&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;Pd metallophilic one, while electron shared delocalized covalent interactions are almost canceled out within the Pd8 chain. The structures and electronic states of the Pd8 chains are found finely tunable by varying the terminal capping ligands, which are evidenced by the relationships between the NIR absorption energy and the distances of the central Pd&#8211;Pd junction. The isocyanide terminated Pd8 complexes (3) further reacted with excess of RNC to afford the Pd4 complexes, [Pd4(meso&#8208;dpmppm)2(RNC)2]2+ (13), and their cyclic voltammograms demonstrated wide range redox behaviors from 2{Pd4}4+ to 2{Pd4}0 through 2{Pd4}2+ &#8596; {Pd8}4+, {Pd8}3+, and {Pd8}2+ strings. Reactions of 2a with 1 eq. of aromatic linear bisisocyanide (BI) in CH2Cl2 deposited insoluble coordination polymers, {[Pd8(meso&#8208;dpmppm)4(BI)](BF4)4}n (5), and interestingly, they were soluble in acetonitrile, DOSY NMR spectra and SAXS curves suggesting that the coordination polymers exist as dynamically 1D self&#8208;assembled coordination polymers comprising ca. 50 units of the Pd8 rod.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The self&#8208;assembly of a nickel&#8208;porphyrin derivative (Ni&#8208;DPPyP) containing two pyridyl coordinating sites and two pentyl chains at trans  meso  positions was studied with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and low energy electron diffraction (LEED) on Au(111). Deposition of Ni&#8208;DPPyP onto Au(111) gave rise to a close&#8208;packed network for coverages smaller or equal to one monolayer as revealed by STM and LEED. The molecular arrangement of this two&#8208;dimensional network is stabilized via hydrogen bonds formed between the pyridyl&#8217;s nitrogen and hydrogen atoms from the pyrrole groups of neighboring molecules. Subsequent deposition of cobalt atoms onto the close&#8208;packed network and post&#8208;deposition annealing at 423 K led to the formation of a Co&#8208;coordinated hexagonal porous network. As confirmed by XPS measurements, the porous network is stabilized by metal&#8208;ligand interactions between one cobalt atom and three pyridyl ligands, each pyridyl ligand coming from a different Ni&#8208;DPPyP molecule.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>5&#8208;Formyl&#8208;deoxyuridine (fdU) and 5&#8208;formyl&#8208;deoxycytidine (fdC) are formyl&#8208;containing nucleosides that are created by oxidative stress in differentiated cells. While fdU is almost exclusively an oxidative stress lesion formed from deoxythymidine (T), the situation for fdC is more complex. Next to formation as an oxidative lesion, it is particularly abundant in stem cells, where it is more frequently formed in an epigenetically important oxidation reaction performed by &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate dependent TET enzymes from 5&#8208;methyl&#8208;deoxycytidine (mdC). Recently, it was shown that genomic fdC and fdU can react with the &#949;&#8208;aminogroups of nucleosomal lysines to give Schiff base adducts that covalently link nucleosomes to genomic DNA. Here we show that fdU features a significantly higher reactivity towards lysine side chains compared with fdC. This result shows that depending on the amounts of fdC and fdU, oxidative stress may have a bigger impact on nucleosome binding than epigenetics.</dc:description>

         <title>A chiral lanthanide tag for stable and rigid attachment to single cysteine residues in proteins for NMR, EPR and time&#8208;resolved luminescence studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A lanthanide&#8208;binding tag site&#8208;specifically attached to a protein presents a tool to probe the protein by multiple spectroscopic techniques, including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and time&#8208;resolved luminescence spectroscopy experiments. Here we present a new stable chiral Ln(III) tag, referred to as C12, for spontaneous and quantitative reaction with a cysteine residue generating a stable thioether bond. The synthetic protocol of the tag is relatively straightforward and the tag is stable for storage and shipping. It displays greatly enhanced reactivity towards selenocysteine, opening a route towards selective tagging of selenocysteine in proteins containing cysteine residues. Loaded with Tb(III) or Tm(III) ions, the C12 tag readily generates pseudocontact shifts (PCS) in protein NMR spectra. It produces a relatively rigid tether between lanthanide and protein, which is beneficial for interpretation of the PCSs by single magnetic susceptibility anisotropy tensors, and it is suitable for measuring distance distributions in double electron&#8211;electron resonance (DEER) experiments. Upon reaction with cysteine or other thiol compounds, the Tb(III) complex exhibits a 100&#8208;fold enhancement in luminescence quantum yield, affording a highly sensitive turn&#8208;on luminescence probe for time&#8208;resolved FRET assays and enzyme reaction monitoring.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Surface Behavior of NDI&#8208;Chromophores Mounted on a Tripodal Scaffold: Towards Self&#8208;Decoupled Chromophores for Single Molecule Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This paper reports the efficient synthesis, the absorption and the emission spectra and the electrochemical properties of a series of 2,6&#8208;disubstituted naphthalene&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;tetra&#173;carbox&#173;di&#173;imide (NDI) tripodal molecules comprising thioacetate anchors for their surface investigations. Our studies showed that particularly pyrrolidinyl group with strong electron&#8208;donating properties enhanced the fluorescence of such core&#8208;substituted NDI chromophore and caused a significant bathochromic shift in the absorption spectrum with a correspondingly narrowed bandgap of 1.94 eV. The redox properties of NDIs are influenced by core substituents as revealed by cyclic voltammetry. The strong electron donating character of pyrrolidine substituents results in relatively high HOMO and LUMO levels of &#8208;5.31 and &#8208;3.37 eV when compared with the parental unsubstituted NDI. UHV&#8208;STM measurements of a submonolayer of the rigid tripodal NDI chromophores deposited on Au(111) by spray deposition show that these molecules mainly tend to adsorb flat in a pairwise fashion on the surface and form unordered films. However, the STML experiments also reveal a few molecular clusters, which might consist of upright oriented molecules protruding from the molecular island and show electroluminescence photon spectra with high electroluminescence yields of up to 6&#215;10  &#8208;3  . These results demonstrate the promising potential of the NDI tripodal chromophores for the fabrication of molecular devices profiting from optical features of the molecular layer.</dc:description>

         <title>The Binding Pocket at the Interface of Multimeric Telomere G&#8208;quadruplexes: Myth or Reality?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Human telomeric DNA with hundreds of repeats of the 5&#8217;&#8208;TTAGGG&#8208;3&#8217; motif plays a crucial role in several biological processes. It folds into G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) structures and features a pocket at the interface of two contiguous G4 blocks. Up to now no structural NMR and crystallographic data are available for ligands interacting with contiguous G4s. We investigated naphthalene diimide monomers and dyads as ligands of a dimeric G4 of human telomeric DNA comparing the results with those of the model monomeric G4. Time&#8208;resolved fluorescence, circular dichroism, isothermal titration calorimetry and molecular modeling were used to elucidate binding features. Ligand fluorescence lifetime and induced circular dichroism unveiled occupancy of the binding site at the interface. Thermodynamic parameters confirmed the hypothesis as they remarkably change for the dyad complexes of the monomeric and dimeric telomeric G4. The bi&#8208;functional ligand structure of the dyads is a fundamental requisite for binding at the G4 interface as only the dyads engage in complexes with 1:1 stoichiometry, lodging in the pocket at the interface and establishing multiple interactions with the DNA skeleton. In the absence of NMR and crystallographic data, our study affords important proofs of binding at the interface pocket and clues on the role played by the ligand structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Mixed Dimensional Nanostructure (UiO&#8208;66&#8208;Decorated MWCNT) as a Nanofiller in Mixed&#8208;Matrix Membranes for Enhanced CO2/CH4 Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Schiff base strategy was exploited to produce mixed&#8208;dimensional nanostructures by coupling 3D UiO&#8208;66 and 1D MWCNT. The resultant MDN was used as nanofiller in mixed&#8208;matrix membranes to separate CO2 from CH4. The MMM containing 5.0&#8197;wt.&#8201;% UiO&#8208;66@MWCNT demonstrated a permeability for pure CO2 nearly twice that of a pure PSf membrane. The CO2/CH4 selectivity of this MMM was also better under similar conditions of pressure and temperature.







Abstract
Mixed&#8208;matrix membranes (MMMs) with combination of two distinct dimensional nanofillers (such as 1D&#8208;3D, 2D&#8208;3D, or 3D&#8208;3D, etc.) have drawn special attention for gas separation applications due to their concerted effects on gas permeation and mechanical properties. An amine&#8208;functionalized 1D multiwalled carbon nanotube (NH2&#8208;MWCNT) with exceptional mechanical strength and rapid gas transport was crosslinked with an amine&#8208;functionalized 3D metal&#8208;organic framework (UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2) with high CO2 affinity in a Schiff base reaction. The resultant crosslinked mixed&#8208;dimensional nanostructure was used as a nanofiller in a polysulfone (PSf) polymer matrix to explore the underlying synergy between 1D and 3D nanostructures on the gas separation performance of MMMs. Cross&#8208;sectional scanning electron microscopy and mapping revealed the homogenous dispersion of UiO&#8208;66@MWCNT in the polymer matrix. The MMM containing 5.0&#8197;wt.&#8201;% UiO&#8208;66@MWCNT demonstrated a superior permeability 8.3 Barrer as compared to the 4.2 Barrer of pure PSf membrane for CO2. Moreover, the selectivity (CO2/CH4) of this MMM was enhanced to 39.5 from the 28.0 observed for pure PSf under similar conditions of pressure and temperature.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Aetokthonotoxin, the Cyanobacterial Neurotoxin Causing Vacuolar Myelinopathy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterocyclic chemistry: Synthesizing the eagle murder's weapon. With the identification of the alkaloid Aetokthonotoxin (AETX) as the neurotoxin causing wildlife deaths in the USA, further studies to characterize the biological effects of this natural product are mandatory. These studies will be enabled by a total synthesis of this natural product, which has been achieved in only five steps overall.







Abstract
Aetokthonotoxin has recently been identified as the cyanobacterial neurotoxin causing Vacuolar Myelinopathy, a fatal neurologic disease, spreading through a trophic cascade and affecting birds of prey such as the bald eagle in the USA.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Heterocyclic chemistry&lt;/b&gt;: Synthesizing the eagle murder's weapon. With the identification of the alkaloid Aetokthonotoxin (AETX) as the neurotoxin causing wildlife deaths in the USA, further studies to characterize the biological effects of this natural product are mandatory. These studies will be enabled by a total synthesis of this natural product, which has been achieved in only five steps overall.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aetokthonotoxin has recently been identified as the cyanobacterial neurotoxin causing Vacuolar Myelinopathy, a fatal neurologic disease, spreading through a trophic cascade and affecting birds of prey such as the bald eagle in the USA. Here, we describe the total synthesis of this specialized metabolite. The complex, highly brominated 1,2&#8217;-biindole could be synthesized via a Somei-type Michael reaction as key step. The optimised sequence yielded the natural product in five steps with an overall yield of 29&#8201;%.&lt;/p&gt;

Getting at the Hyp of amanitin: A formal study of structure&#8208;function relationships for trans&#8208;hydroxyproline &#8211; a key functionality the specifies the toxicity of amanitin is undertaken to probe aspects of H&#8208;bonding and other interactions with analogs of hydroxyl&#8208;proline. The toxin is surprisingly refractory to replacing the hydroxyproline.







Abstract
Alpha&#8208;amanitin, an extremely toxic bicyclic octapeptide extracted from the death&#8208;cap mushroom, Amanita phalloides, is a highly selective allosteric inhibitor of RNA polymerase II. Following on growing interest in using this toxin as a payload in antibody&#8208;drug conjugates, herein we report the synthesis and biochemical evaluation of several new derivatives of this toxin to probe the role of the trans&#8208;hydroxyproline (Hyp), which is known to be critical for toxicity. This structure activity relationship (SAR) study represents the first of its kind to use various Hyp&#8208;analogs to alter the conformational and H&#8208;bonding properties of Hyp in amanitin.

         <title>G&#8208;Quadruplex formation by DNA sequences deficient in guanines: Two tetrad parallel quadruplexes do not fold intramolecularly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Guanine quadruplexes (G4s) are non&#8208;canonical forms of nucleic acids which are frequently found in genomes. The stability of G4s depends, among other factors, on the number of G&#8208;tetrads. Three&#8208; or four&#8208;tetrad G4s and antiparallel two&#8208;tetrad G4s have been characterized experimentally; however, the existence of an intramolecular (i.e., not dimeric or multimeric) two&#8208;tetrad parallel&#8208;stranded DNA G4 has never been experimentally observed. Many sequences compatible with two&#8208;tetrad G4 can be found in important genomic regions such as promoters, for which parallel G4s predominate. Using experimental and theoretical approaches, we study the propensity of the model sequence AATGGGTGGGTTTGGGTGGGTAA to form an intramolecular parallel&#8208;stranded G4 upon increasing the number of GGG&#8208;to&#8208;GG substitutions. Deletion of a single G leads to the formation of intramolecular G4s with a stacked G&#8208;triad, whose topology depends on the location of the deletion. Removal of another guanine from another G&#8208;tract leads to bi&#8208; or multi&#8208;meric G4s. Further deletions mostly prevent formation of any stable G4. Thus, a solitary two&#8208;tetrad parallel DNA G4 is not thermodynamically stable and requires additional interactions through some capping residues. However, transiently populated metastable two&#8208;tetrad species can associate to form stable dimers, the dynamic formation of which may play additional delicate roles in gene regulation. These findings provide essential information for bioinformatics studies searching for potential G4s in genomes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Nitric oxide (NO) plays a multifaceted role in human physiology and pathophysiology and its controlled delivery has great prospect in therapeutic applications. &#160;The light&#8208;activated NO uncaging from NO caging compounds allows this free radical to be released with accurate control of site and dosage, which strictly determine its biological effects. Molecular constructs able to activate fluorescence concomitantly to NO release offer the important advantage of the easy and real&#8208;time tracking of the amount of NO uncaged in a non&#8208;invasive fashion even in cell environment. In this contribution, we seek to provide an overview of the advances in photoactivatable NO releasers bearing fluorescent reporting functionalities achieved in our and other laboratories, highlighting the rationale design and their potential therapeutic applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report an iron(II)&#8208;catalyzed polymerization of arylallenes. This reaction proceeds rapidly at room temperature in the presence of a hydride co&#8208;catalyst to generate polymers of weight up to  M  n  = 189 000 Da. We have determined the polymer structure and chain length for a range of monomers through a combination of NMR, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis. Mechanistically we postulate that the co&#8208;catalyst does not form an iron(II) hydride  in situ  , but instead the chain growth is proceeding via a reactive Fe(III) species. We have also performed kinetic and isotopic experiments to further our understanding. The formation of a highly unusual 1,3&#8208;substituted cyclobutane side&#8208;product is also investigated.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of Nitrogen&#8208;doping in the Catalytic Transfer Hydrogenation of Phenol to Cyclohexanone with Formic Acid over Pd supported on Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd/OCNT is deactivated during the transfer hydrogenation of phenol with formic acid to cyclohexanone because of the full coverage of formate on Pd. By comparison, Pd/NCNT is highly active and selective in the transfer hydrogenation and deactivation does not occur. The nonplanar adsorption of phenol on NCNTs via weak O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interactions enables the transfer hydrogenation with the adsorbed formate on Pd.







Abstract
Highly selective one&#8208;step hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanone, an important intermediate in the production of nylon 6 and nylon 66, is desirable but remains a challenge. Pd nanoparticles supported on nitrogen&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;functionalized carbon nanotubes (NCNTs, OCNTs) were prepared, characterized, and applied in the hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanone to study the effect of N&#8208;doping. Almost full conversion of phenol with high selectivity to cyclohexanone was achieved over Pd/NCNT under mild reaction conditions using either H2 or formic acid (FA) as a hydrogen source. The effects of reaction temperature and FA/phenol ratio and the reusability were investigated. Separate FA decomposition experiments without and with the addition of phenol were performed to investigate the reaction mechanism, especially the deactivation behavior. Deactivation was observed for both catalysts during the FA decomposition, while only Pd/OCNT rather than Pd/NCNT was deactivated in the transfer hydrogenation with FA and the FA decomposition in the presence of phenol, indicating the unique role of N&#8208;doping. Therefore, we assume that deactivation is caused by the strongly bound formates on the active Pd sites, suppressing further FA decomposition and/or transfer hydrogenation on Pd. The nonplanar adsorption of phenol on NCNTs via weak O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interactions enables the occurrence of the subsequent hydrogenation by adsorbed formate on Pd.

&lt;p&gt;Highly selective one-step hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanone, an important intermediate in the production of nylon 6 and nylon 66, is desirable but remains a challenge. Pd nanoparticles supported on nitrogen- and oxygen-functionalized carbon nanotubes (NCNTs, OCNTs) were prepared, characterized, and applied in the hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanone to study the effect of N-doping. Almost full conversion of phenol with high selectivity to cyclohexanone was achieved over Pd/NCNT under mild reaction conditions using either H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or formic acid (FA) as a hydrogen source. The effects of reaction temperature and FA/phenol ratio and the reusability were investigated. Separate FA decomposition experiments without and with the addition of phenol were performed to investigate the reaction mechanism, especially the deactivation behavior. Deactivation was observed for both catalysts during the FA decomposition, while only Pd/OCNT rather than Pd/NCNT was deactivated in the transfer hydrogenation with FA and the FA decomposition in the presence of phenol, indicating the unique role of N-doping. Therefore, we assume that deactivation is caused by the strongly bound formates on the active Pd sites, suppressing further FA decomposition and/or transfer hydrogenation on Pd. The nonplanar adsorption of phenol on NCNTs via weak O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interactions enables the occurrence of the subsequent hydrogenation by adsorbed formate on Pd.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Benzobicyclo[3.2.1]octanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stepwise or concerted, the outcome is the best: An asymmetric synthesis of benzobicyclo[3.2.1]octanes, basic antibiotic skeletons, in very good yields, dr and ee has been developed through the tandem Wittig/[3+2] annulation of lawsone aldehydes and phosphoranes under a catalytic amount of quinine&#8208;thiourea. The sustainability of this new reaction was investigated by changing various reaction coordinates; the catalyst was recovered at more than 50&#8201;%.







Abstract
Lawsone aldehydes were directly transformed into the biologically important, unique carbon skeleton of chiral methanobenzo[f]azulenes/methanodibenzo[a,d][7]annulenes in high dr and ee and in very good yields by using quinine&#8208;thiourea&#8208;catalyzed tandem Wittig/intramolecular Michael/intramolecular aldol reactions. This asymmetric catalytic tandem protocol will be highly useful because these final molecules are basic skeletons of important antibiotics.

         <title>Phosphorus&#8208;Containing Superbases: Recent Progress in the Chemistry of Electron&#8208;Abundant Phosphines and Phosphazenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hunt is still on for the most powerful neutral superbase. The steadily growing scope of applications has resulted in a renaissance of highly electron&#8208;rich phosphorus&#8208;containing Lewis and Br&#248;nsted bases. Strongly &#960;&#8208;donating substituents at the center of basicity can be employed to increase the proton affinity and the &#963;&#8208;donation ability. This minireview highlights recently published achievements focusing especially on the past five years.







Abstract
The renaissance of Br&#248;nsted superbases is primarily based on their pronounced capacity for a large variety of chemical transformations under mild reaction conditions. Four major set screws are available for the selective tuning of the basicity: the nature of the basic center (N, P, &#8230;), the degree of electron donation by substituents to the central atom, the possibility of charge delocalization, and the energy gain by hydrogen bonding. Within the past decades, a plethora of neutral electron&#8208;rich phosphine and phosphazene bases have appeared in the literature. Their outstanding properties and advantages over inorganic or charged bases have now made them indispensable as auxiliary bases in deprotonation processes. Herein, an update of the chemistry of basic phosphines and phosphazenes is given. In addition, due to widespread interest, their use in catalysis or as ligands in coordination chemistry is highlighted.

         <title>Methyl&#8208;Induced Polarization Destabilizes the Noncovalent Interactions of N&#8208;Methylated Lysines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylation of ammonium weakens its electrostatic attraction with protein functional groups &#8208; salt bridges, hydrogen bonds and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions weaken by as much as 10.3, 7.9 and 3.5&#8201;kT, respectively. The weakened electrostatics is due to altered inductive effects that overcome increased attraction from methyl&#8208;enhanced polarizability and dispersion. Due to their fundamental nature, these effects are expected to be widely present.







Abstract
Lysine methylation can modify noncovalent interactions by altering lysine's hydrophobicity as well as its electronic structure. Although the ramifications of the former are documented, the effects of the latter remain largely unknown. Understanding the electronic structure is important for determining how biological methylation modulates protein&#8722;protein binding, and the impact of artificial methylation experiments in which methylated lysines are used as spectroscopic probes and protein crystallization facilitators. The benchmarked first&#8208;principles calculations undertaken here reveal that methyl&#8208;induced polarization weakens the electrostatic attraction of amines with protein functional groups &#8211; salt bridges, hydrogen bonds and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions weaken by as much as 10.3, 7.9 and 3.5&#8201;kT, respectively. Multipole analysis shows that weakened electrostatics is due to the altered inductive effects, which overcome increased attraction from methyl&#8208;enhanced polarizability and dispersion. Due to their fundamental nature, these effects are expected to be present in many cases. A survey of methylated lysines in protein structures reveals several cases in which methyl&#8208;induced polarization is the primary driver of altered noncovalent interactions; in these cases, destabilizations are found to be in the 0.6&#8211;4.7&#8201;kT range. The clearest case of where methyl&#8208;induced polarization plays a dominant role in regulating biological function is that of the PHD1&#8208;PHD2 domain, which recognizes lysine&#8208;methylated states on histones. These results broaden our understanding of how methylation modulates noncovalent interactions.

         <title>Rapid Aqueous Synthesis of Large&#8208;Size and Edge/Defect&#8208;Rich Porous Pd and Pd&#8208;Alloyed Nanomesh for Electrocatalytic Ethanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and rapid aqueous synthesis of Pd and Pd&#8208;alloyed porous nanomeshes (PNMs) with multiple structural advantages like ultrathinness, large&#8208;size, porosity, edge/defect richness, and being ligand&#8208;free results in more catalytically active sites and high atomic efficiency. Synergic structural and compositional enhancement effects enhanced the mass activity, anti&#8208;poisoning ability, and stability/durability in electrocatalytic EOR of PNM Pd87Cu13 compared to PdCu PNMs with other elemental ratios, Pd PNMs, and Pd NPs.







Abstract
In this work, a facile aqueous synthesis strategy was used (complete in 5&#8197;min at room temperature) to produce large&#8208;size Pd, PdCu, and PdPtCu nanomeshes without additional organic ligands or solvent and the volume restriction of reaction solution. The obtained metallic nanomeshes possess graphene&#8208;like morphology and a large size of dozens of microns. Abundant edges (coordinatively unsaturated sites, steps, and corners), defects (twins), and mesopores are seen in the metallic ultrathin structures. The formation mechanism for porous Pd nanomeshes disclosed that they undergo oriented attachment growth along the &#10216;111&#10217; direction. Owing to structural and compositional advantages, PdCu porous nanomeshes with certain elemental ratios (e.&#8201;g., Pd87Cu13) presented enhanced electrocatalytic performance (larger mass activity, better CO tolerance and stability) toward ethanol oxidation.

         <title>Externally Regulated Specific Molecular Recognition Driven Pathway Selectivity in Supramolecular Polymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Externally added 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) introduces new nucleation conditions and influences the thermodynamic landscape in the supramolecular polymerization of a carboxylic&#8208;acid appended NDI&#8208;monomer. With 100&#8201;% DMAP, well&#8208;defined J&#8208;aggregation results in the formation of fibrillar morphology, irrespective of the cooling rate. With 10&#8201;% DMAP, depending on the cooling rate, either J&#8208;aggregate or H&#8208;aggregate (or mixture) is noticed with 1D and 2D morphology, respectively. With 2.5&#8201;% DMAP and slow cooling, extended 2D sheet can be obtained from the thermodynamically controlled H&#8208;aggregation.







Abstract
This article reveals 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) regulated pathway selectivity in the supramolecular polymerization of a naphthalene&#8208;diimide derivative (NDI&#8208;1), appended with a carboxylic acid group. In decane, NDI&#8208;1 produces ill&#8208;defined aggregate (Agg&#8208;1) due to different H&#8208;bonding motifs of the &#8722;COOH group. With one mole equivalent DMAP, the NDI&#8208;1/DMAP complex introduces new nucleation condition and exhibits a cooperative supramolecular polymerization producing J&#8208;aggregated fibrillar nanostructure (Agg&#8208;2). With 10&#8201;% DMAP and fast cooling (10&#8197;K/min), similar nucleation and open chain H&#8208;bonding with the free monomer in an anti&#8208;parallel arrangement produces identical J&#8208;aggregate (Agg&#8208;2a).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Externally added 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP)&lt;/b&gt; introduces new nucleation conditions and influences the thermodynamic landscape in the supramolecular polymerization of a carboxylic-acid appended NDI-monomer. With 100&#8201;% DMAP, well-defined J-aggregation results in the formation of fibrillar morphology, irrespective of the cooling rate. With 10&#8201;% DMAP, depending on the cooling rate, either J-aggregate or H-aggregate (or mixture) is noticed with 1D and 2D morphology, respectively. With 2.5&#8201;% DMAP and slow cooling, extended 2D sheet can be obtained from the thermodynamically controlled H-aggregation.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article reveals 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) regulated pathway selectivity in the supramolecular polymerization of a naphthalene-diimide derivative (NDI-1), appended with a carboxylic acid group. In decane, NDI-1 produces ill-defined aggregate (Agg-1) due to different H-bonding motifs of the &#8722;COOH group. With one mole equivalent DMAP, the NDI-1/DMAP complex introduces new nucleation condition and exhibits a cooperative supramolecular polymerization producing J-aggregated fibrillar nanostructure (Agg-2). With 10&#8201;% DMAP and fast cooling (10&#8197;K/min), similar nucleation and open chain H-bonding with the free monomer in an anti-parallel arrangement produces identical J-aggregate (Agg-2a). With 2.5&#8201;% DMAP and slow cooling (1&#8197;K/min), a distinct nucleation and supramolecular polymerization pathway emerge leading to the thermodynamically controlled Agg-3 with face-to-face stacking and 2D-morphology. Slow cooling with 5&#8211;10&#8201;% DMAP produces a mixture of Agg-2a and Agg-3. Computational modelling studies provide valuable insights into the internal order and the pathway complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Gelatin&#8208;Derived 1D Carbon Nanofiber Architecture with Simultaneous Decoration of Single Fe&#8722;Nx Sites and Fe/Fe3C Nanoparticles for Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>

Formidable fibers: A gelatin&#8208;derived 1D hybrid electrocatalyst with highly dispersed Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles encapsulated into Fe,N co&#8208;doped carbon nanofibers was synthesized. Owing to the distinct 1D nanofiber structure and the synergistic effect of Fe/Fe3C and Fe&#8722;Nx sites, the electrocatalyst is highly active for ORR with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.885&#8197;V (outperforming commercial Pt/C) and a superior electrochemical stability in alkaline electrolyte. Similarly, it also shows a high power density and a superior stability in Zn&#8208;air battery.







Abstract
Exploring high&#8208;performance non&#8208;precious&#8208;metal electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is critical. Herein, a scalable and cost&#8208;effective strategy is reported for the construction of one&#8208;dimensional carbon nanofiber architectures with simultaneous decoration of single Fe&#8722;Nx sites and highly dispersed Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles for efficient ORR, through the FeIII&#8208;complex&#8208;assisted electrospinning of gelatin nanofibers with subsequent pre&#8208;oxidation and carbonization. Results show that the presence of a FeIII complex enables the 1D gelatin nanofibers to be well retained during the pre&#8208;oxidation process. Owing to the distinct 1D nanofiber structure and the synergistic effect of Fe/Fe3C and Fe&#8722;Nx sites, the resulting electrocatalyst is highly active for ORR with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.885&#8197;V (outperforming commercial Pt/C) and a superior electrochemical stability in alkaline electrolytes. Similarly, it also shows a high power density (144.7&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and a superior stability in Zn&#8208;air batteries. This work opens a path for the design and synthesis of 1D carbon electrocatalyst for efficient ORR catalysis.

         <title>Dual Plasmonic Au&#8722;Cu2&#8722;xS Nanocomposites: Design Strategies and Photothermal Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hot metals: Au&#8208;Cu2&#8722;xS nanocomposites are a promising class of plasmonic nanomaterials that can be rationally designed to achieve strong light absorption and high photothermal conversion efficiency. In this Minireview, we show the different hybrid configurations that are possible for Au&#8722;Cu2&#8722;xS nanocomposites, present various synthetic strategies for their fabrication, and discuss their tunable plasmon&#8208;induced absorption features and photothermal properties. We also demonstrate their potential use in photothermal therapy and in the blossoming field of theranostics.







Abstract
Coupling two different materials to create a hybrid nanostructured system is a powerful strategy for achieving synergistically enhanced properties and advanced functionalities. In the case of Au and Cu2&#8722;xS, their combination on the nanoscale results in dual plasmonic Au&#8722;Cu2&#8722;xS nanocomposites that exhibit intense photon absorption in both the visible and the near&#8208;infrared spectral ranges. Their strong light&#8208;absorbing properties translate to superior photothermal transduction efficiency, making them attractive in photothermal&#8208;based applications. There are several nanostructure configurations that are possible for the Au&#8722;Cu2&#8722;xS system, and the successful fabrication of a particular architecture often requires a carefully planned synthetic strategy. In this Minireview, the different synthetic approaches that can be employed to produce rationally designed Au&#8722;Cu2&#8722;xS nanocomposites are presented, with a focus on the experimental protocols that can lead to heterodimer, core&#8211;shell, reverse core&#8211;shell, and yolk&#8211;shell configurations. The photothermal behavior of these materials is also discussed, providing a glimpse of their potential use as photothermally active agents in therapeutic and theranostic applications.

         <title>Relevance of &#960;&#8208;Backbonding for the Reactivity of Electrophilic Anions [B12X11]&#8722; (X=F, Cl, Br, I, CN)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of &#960;&#8208;backbonding is discussed, which was observed between the &#960;&#8208;acceptors CO/N2 and the closo&#8208;dodecaborate fragments [B12X11]&#8722; (X=F, Cl, Br, I, CN). The highly reactive [B12X11]&#8722; anions transfer electron density from their delocalized &#963;&#8208;electron systems into antibonding orbitals of the respective acceptor molecules. Moreover, the comprehensive set of data provided with this study gives insights into the reactivity of [B12X11]&#8722; anions depending on the substituent X.







Abstract
Electrophilic anions of type [B12X11]&#8722; posses a vacant positive boron binding site within the anion. In a comparatitve experimental and theoretical study, the reactivity of [B12X11]&#8722; with X=F, Cl, Br, I, CN is characterized towards different nucleophiles: (i) noble gases (NGs) as &#963;&#8208;donors and (ii) CO/N2 as &#963;&#8208;donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptors. Temperature&#8208;dependent formation of [B12X11NG]&#8722; indicates the enthalpy order (X=CN)&gt;(X=Cl)&#8776;(X=Br)&gt;(X=I)&#8776;(X=F) almost independent of the NG in good agreement with calculated trends. The observed order is explained by an interplay of the electron deficiency of the vacant boron site in [B12X11]&#8722; and steric effects. The binding of CO and N2 to [B12X11]&#8722; is significantly stronger. The B3LYP 0&#8197;K attachment enthapies follow the order (X=F)&gt;(X=CN)&gt;(X=Cl)&gt;(X=Br)&gt;(X=I), in contrast to the NG series. The bonding motifs of [B12X11CO]&#8722; and [B12X11N2]&#8722; were characterized using cryogenic ion trap vibrational spectroscopy by focusing on the CO and N2 stretching frequencies 
 and 
, respectively. Observed shifts of 
 and 
 are explained by an interplay between electrostatic effects (blue shift), due to the positive partial charge, and by &#960;&#8208;backdonation (red shift). Energy decomposition analysis and analysis of natural orbitals for chemical valence support all conclusions based on the experimental results. This establishes a rational understanding of [B12X11]&#8722; reactivety dependent on the substituent X and provides first systematic data on &#960;&#8208;backdonation from delocalized &#963;&#8208;electron systems of closo&#8208;borate anions.

         <title>Correlation between the Dynamics of Nanoconfined Water and the Local Chemical Environment in Calcium Silicate Hydrate Nanominerals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Xonotlite and tobermorite minerals are characterized by layered structures containing pendant CaOH and SiOH groups that interact with confined water molecules. In these systems, the hydrogen&#8208;bond network and the dynamics of confined water are modified by the presence of different chemical environments. Herein, is shown that the ordered &#8220;ice&#8208;like&#8221; distribution of water molecules found in the SiOH&#8208;rich environments, as in tobermorite, is converted to a disordered &#8220;liquid&#8208;like&#8221; distribution in the CaOH&#8208;rich environment in xonotlite.







Abstract
Calcium silicate hydrates are members of a large family of minerals with layered structures containing pendant CaOH and SiOH groups that interact with confined water molecules. To rationalize the impact of the local chemical environment on the dynamics of water, SiOH&#8208; and CaOH&#8208;rich model nanocrystals were synthesized by using the continuous supercritical hydrothermal method and then systematically studied by a combination of spectroscopic techniques. In our comprehensive analysis, the ultrafast relaxation dynamics of hanging hydroxy groups can be univocally assigned to CaOH or SiOH environments, and the local chemical environment largely affects the H&#8208;bond network of the solvation water. Interestingly, the ordered &#8220;ice&#8208;like&#8221; solvation water found in the SiOH&#8208;rich environments is converted to a disordered &#8220;liquid&#8208;like&#8221; distribution in the CaOH&#8208;rich environment. This refined picture of the dynamics of confined water and hydroxy groups in calcium silicate hydrates can also be applied to other water&#8208;containing materials, with a significant impact in many fields of materials science.

         <title>Spectroscopic and Molecular Docking Study of the Interaction between Neutral Re(I) Tetrazolate Complexes and Bovine Serum Albumin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interactions between bovine serum albumin (BSA) and two Re(I) complexes, differing in the functionality attached to the tetrazole, were investigated using spectroscopic methods and molecular modelling. Molecular docking was applied for the first time using Re(I) complexes as binding partners for BSA. This study revealed that subtle changes in the functional group of Re(I) complexes influence their interactions with BSA.







Abstract
Re(I) complexes have potential in biomedical sciences as imaging agents, diagnostics and therapeutics. Thus, it is crucial to understand how Re(I) complexes interact with carrier proteins, like serum albumins. Here, two neutral Re(I) complexes were used (fac&#8208;[Re(CO)3(1,10&#8208;phenanthroline)L], in which L is either 4&#8208;cyanophenyltetrazolate (1) or 4&#8208;methoxycarbonylphenyltetrazole ester (2), to study the interactions with bovine serum albumin (BSA). Spectroscopic measurements, calculations of thermodynamic and F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer parameters, as well as molecular modelling, were performed to study differential binding between BSA and complex 1 and 2. Induced&#8208;fit docking combined with quantum&#8208;polarised ligand docking were employed in what is believed to be a first for a Re(I) complex as a ligand for BSA. Our findings provide a basis for other molecular interaction studies and suggest that subtle functional group alterations at the terminal region of the Re(I) complex have a significant impact on the ability of this class of compounds to interact with BSA.

N&#8208;terminal thiourea&#8208;modified helical l&#8208;Leu&#8208;based peptide (0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;%) catalyzed a highly enantioselective 1,4&#8208;addition reaction between various &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrenes and dialkyl malonates to give 1,4&#8208;adducts with a 65&#8211;96&#8201;% ee. The length of the peptide chain, right&#8208;handed helical structure, amide N&#8722;Hs, and the N&#8208;terminal thiourea moiety played crucial roles in the asymmetric induction.







Abstract
N&#8208;terminal thiourea&#8208;modified l&#8208;Leu&#8208;based peptide {(3,5&#8208;diCF3Ph)NHC(=S)&#8208;(l&#8208;Leu&#8208;l&#8208;Leu&#8208;Ac5c)2&#8208;OMe} with five&#8208;membered ring &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted &#945;&#8208;amino acids (Ac5c) catalyzed a highly enantioselective 1,4&#8208;addition reaction between &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene and dimethyl malonate. The enantioselective reaction required only 0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;% chiral peptide&#8208;catalyst in the presence of iPr2EtN (2.5&#8197;equiv.), and gave a 1,4&#8208;adduct with 93&#8201;% ee of an 85&#8201;% yield. As Michael acceptors, various &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene derivatives such as methyl, p&#8208;fluoro, p&#8208;bromo, and p&#8208;methoxy substituents on the phenyl group, 2&#8208;furyl, 2&#8208;thiophenyl, and naphthyl &#946;&#8208;nitroethylenes could be applied. Furthermore, various alkyl malonates and cyclic &#946;&#8208;keto&#8208;esters could be used as Michael donors. It became clear that the length of the peptide chain, a right&#8208;handed helical structure, amide N&#8722;Hs, and the N&#8208;terminal thiourea moiety play crucial roles in asymmetric induction.

         <dc:description>Photoelectrochemical cathodic protection (CP) technology is considered as a green metallic corrosion protection technology, which uses solar energy for corrosion protection and does not consume any anode materials. A CdIn 2  S 4  /WO 3  nanocomposite photoelectrode was prepared in this work, and its photoelectrochemical CP performance and mechanism were studied and analyzed. WO 3  has a well band matching with CdIn 2  S 4  , leading to a significantly enhanced photoelectrochemical CP performance of the CdIn 2  S 4  /WO 3  nanocomposite. Meanwhile, as confirmed in this work, the CdIn 2  S 4  /WO 3  nanocomposite can store photoinduced electrons under light illumination by intercalation reactions and changing the valence state of W element, and it can discharge in the dark state to provide continuous CP for the coupled metals. This research will promote the practical application process of the photoelectrochemical CP technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Janus Pyrrolopyrrole aza&#8208;Dipyrrin: Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Assemblies and Slow Magnetic Relaxation of the Cobalt(II) Complex in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel pyrrolopyrrole azadipyrrin (  Janus&#8208;PPAD  ) with Janus duality was synthesized by a Schiff base forming reaction of diketopyrrolopyrrole. The orthogonal interactions of the hydrogen&#8208;bonding ketopyrrole and metal&#8208;coordinating azadipyrrin moieties in  Janus&#8208;PPAD  enabled arrangement of metal ions at regular intervals: zinc(II) and cobalt(II) coordination provided metal&#8208;coordinated  Janus&#8208;PPAD  dimers, which can subsequently form hydrogen&#8208;bonded one&#8208;dimensional arrays both in solution and in the solid state. The supramolecular assembly formation of the zinc(II) complex in solution was investigated by 1H NMR spectroscopy based on the isodesmic model, in which a binding constant for the elongation of assemblies is constant. In the solid state, owing to the tetrahedral coordination, the cobalt(II) complex exhibited a slow magnetic relaxation due to the negative  D  value of &#8722;27.1 cm  &#8722;1  with the effective relaxation energy barrier  U  eff  &#160;of 38.0 cm  &#8211;1  . The effect of magnetic dilution on the relaxation behavior is discussed. The relaxation mechanism in the low temperature range was analyzed by considering spin lattice interactions and quantum tunneling effects. The easy&#8208;axis magnetic anisotropy was confirmed, and the relevant wave functions were obtained by ab initio CASSCF calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Binding Insights into Quadruplex Selective Carbazole Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymorphic G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) secondary DNA structures have received increasing attention in medicinal chemistry owing to their key involvement in the regulation of the maintenance of genomic stability, telomere length homeostasis and transcription of important proto&#8208;oncogenes. Different classes of G4 ligands have been developed for the potential treatment of several human diseases. Among them, the carbazole scaffold with appropriate side chain appendages has attracted much interest for designing G4 ligands. Because of its large and rigid &#960;&#8208;conjugation system and ease of functionalization at three different positions, a variety of carbazole derivatives have been synthesized from various natural or synthetic sources for potential applications in G4&#8208;based therapeutics and biosensors. Herein, we provide an updated close&#8208;up of the literatures on carbazole&#8208;based G4 ligands with particular focus given on their detailed binding insights studied by NMR spectroscopy. The structure&#8208;activity relationships and the opportunities and challenges of their potential applications as biosensors and therapeutics are also discussed. This review will provide an overall picture of carbazole ligands with remarkable G4 topological preference, fluorescence properties and significant bioactivity; portraying carbazole as a very promising scaffold for assembling G4 ligands with a range of novel functional applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoredox Catalysis Using Heterogenized Iridium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterogenized photoredox catalysts provide a path for sustainable chemical synthesis using highly tunable, reusable constructs. Here, heterogenized iridium complexes as photoredox catalysts were assembled via covalent attachment to metal oxide surfaces (ITO, ZrO2  , Al2  O3  ) in thin film or nanopowder constructs. The goal was to understand which materials provided the most promising constructs for catalysis. &#160;To do this, reductive dehalogenation of bromoacetophenone to acetophenone was studied as a test reaction for system optimization. All catalyst constructs produced acetophenone with high conversions and yields with the fastest reactions complete in fifteen minutes using Al  2  O  3  supports. The nanopowder catalysts resulted in faster and more efficient catalysis, while the thin film catalysts were more robust and easily reused. Importantly, the thin film constructs show promise for future photoelectrochemical and electrochemical photoredox setups. Finally, all catalysts were reusable 2&#8208;3 times, performing at least 1000 turnovers (Al2O3  ), demonstrating that heterogenized catalysts are a sustainable catalyst alternative.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionization and Photofragmentation of Isolated Metalloporphyrin Cations Investigated by VUV Action Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We investigated the photoionization and fragmentation of isolated metal protoporphyrin IX cations (MPPIX with M&#160;= Fe, Co, Zn) by means of VUV action spectroscopy in the energy range of 8.5&#8208;35 eV. Experiments were carried out in the gas phase by interfacing an electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometer with a synchrotron beamline. The mass spectra and partial ion yields show that photoexcitation of the precursor ions predominantly leads to  &#8226;  CH  2  COOH radical side&#8208;chain losses of the macrocycle with additional methyl radical (  &#8226;  CH  3  ) side&#8208;chain losses. Ionization, in contrast, leads to the formation of the intact ionized precursor and various doubly charged fragments which are mostly due to side&#8208;chain cleavages. Although statistical fragmentation dominates, we found evidence for non&#8208;statistical processes such as new fragments involving e.g. single and double H  2  O losses, indicating that different relaxation mechanisms are at play upon photoionization compared to photoexcitation. The measured ionization energies were 9.6 &#177; 0.2 eV, 9.4 &#177; 0.2 eV and 9.6 &#177; 0.2 eV for FePPIX  +  , CoPPIX  +  and ZnPPIX  +  , respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>The Effect of Interlayer Anion Grafting on Water Oxidation Electrocatalysis: A Comparative Study of Ni&#8208; and Co&#8208;Based Brucite&#8208;Type Layered Hydroxides, Layered Double Hydroxides and Hydroxynitrate Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The urge for carbon&#8208;neutral green energy conversion and storage technologies has invoked the resurgence of interest in applying brucite&#8208;type materials as low&#8208;cost oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts in basic media. Transition metal layered hydroxides belonging to the brucite&#8208;type structure family have been shown to display remarkable electrochemical activity. Recent studies on the earth&#8208;abundant Fe  3+  containing m&#246;ssbauerite and Fe  3+  rich Co&#8208;Fe layered oxyhydroxide carbonates have suggested that grafted interlayer anions might play a key role in OER catalysis. To probe the effect of such interlayer anion grafting in brucite&#8208;like layered hydroxides, we report here a systematic study on the electrocatalytic performance of three distinct Ni and Co brucite&#8208;type layered structures, namely, (i) brucite&#8208;type M(OH)  2  without any interlayer anions, (ii) LDHs with free interlayer anions, and (iii) hydroxynitrate salts with grafted interlayer anions. The electrochemical results indeed show that grafting has an evident impact on the electronic structure and the observed OER activity. Ni&#8208; and Co&#8208;hydroxynitrate salts with grafted anions display notably earlier formations of the electrocatalytically active species. Particularly Co&#8208;hydroxynitrate salts exhibit lower overpotentials at 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  (  &#951;  = 0.34 V) and medium current densities of 100 mA cm  &#8208;2  (  &#951;  = 0.40 V) compared to the corresponding brucite&#8208;type hydroxides and LDH materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Acylhydrazone Sub&#8208;Units as a Proton Cargo Delivery System in 7&#8208;Hydroxyquinoline</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reimagined concept of long&#8208;range tautomeric proton transfer using crane sub&#8208;units has been presented by designing and synthesising two new acylhydrazones containing 7&#8208;hydroxyquinoline (7&#8208;OHQ) platform. The acylhydrazone sub&#8208;units attached to the 7&#8208;OHQ at 8th position act as a crane arm for proton cargo delivery to the quinoline nitrogen. Light&#8208;induced tautomerization to their keto tautomers leads to Z/E isomerization of the C=C axle bond, followed by proton delivery to the quinoline nitrogen by covalent or hydrogen bond formation. The axle being either imine or ketimine bond is the structural difference between the studied compounds. The &#8208;CH3 group in the latter provides steric strain, resulting in different proton transport pathway. Both compounds show long thermal stability in the switched state, which creates a tunable action of bidirectional proton cargo transport by using different wavelengths of irradiation. Upon addition of acid, the quinoline nitrogen is protonated, which results in E/Z configurational switching of the acylhydrazone sub&#8208;units. This was proven by single crystal X&#8208;ray structure analysis and NMR spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterodinuclear Zn(II), Mg(II) or Co(III) with Na(I) Catalysts for Carbon Dioxide and Cyclohexene Oxide Ring Opening Copolymerizations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series heterodinuclear catalysts, operating without co&#8208;catalyst, show good performances for the ring opening copolymerization (ROCOP) of cyclohexene oxide and carbon dioxide. The complexes feature a macrocyclic ligand designed to coordinate metals such as Zn(II), Mg(II) or Co(III), in a Schiff base &#8216;pocket&#8217;, and Na(I) in a modified crown&#8208;ether binding &#8216;pocket&#8217;. The 11 new catalysts are used to explore the influences of the metal combinations and ligand backbones over catalytic activity and selectivity. The highest performance catalyst features the Co(III)Na(I) combination, [N, N'&#8208;bis(3,3&#8217;&#8208;triethylene glycol salicylidene)&#8208;1,2&#8208;ethylenediamino cobalt(III) di(acetate)]sodium (7), and it shows both excellent activity and selectivity at 1 bar carbon dioxide pressure (TOF = 1590 h&#8208;1, &gt;99% polymer selectivity, 1:10: 4000, 100 &#186;C), as well as high activity at higher carbon dioxide pressure (TOF = 4343 h&#8208;1, 20 bar, 1:10:25000). Its rate law shows a first order dependence on both catalyst and cyclohexene oxide concentrations and a zeroth order for carbon dioxide pressure, over the range 10&#8208;40 bar. These new catalysts eliminate any need for ionic or Lewis base co&#8208;catalyst rather earth&#8208;abundant and inexpensive Na(I) adjacent to a second metal delivers efficient catalysis. They highlight the potential for well&#8208;designed ancillary ligands and inexpensive Group 1 metals to deliver high performance heterodinuclear catalysts for carbon dioxide copolymerizations and, in future, these catalysts may also show promise in other alternating copolymerization and carbon dioxide utilizations.</dc:description>

The highest performance catalyst features the Co(III)Na(I) combination, [N, N'-bis(3,3&#8217;-triethylene glycol salicylidene)-1,2-ethylenediamino cobalt(III) di(acetate)]sodium (7), and it shows both excellent activity and selectivity at 1 bar carbon dioxide pressure (TOF = 1590 h-1, &amp;gt;99% polymer selectivity, 1:10: 4000, 100 &#186;C), as well as high activity at higher carbon dioxide pressure (TOF = 4343 h-1, 20 bar, 1:10:25000). Its rate law shows a first order dependence on both catalyst and cyclohexene oxide concentrations and a zeroth order for carbon dioxide pressure, over the range 10-40 bar. These new catalysts eliminate any need for ionic or Lewis base co-catalyst rather earth-abundant and inexpensive Na(I) adjacent to a second metal delivers efficient catalysis. They highlight the potential for well-designed ancillary ligands and inexpensive Group 1 metals to deliver high performance heterodinuclear catalysts for carbon dioxide copolymerizations and, in future, these catalysts may also show promise in other alternating copolymerization and carbon dioxide utilizations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chiral Perylene Bisimide Dyes by Interlocked Arene Substituents in the Bay Area</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of perylene bisimide (PBI) dyes bearing various aryl substituents in 1,6,7,12 bay positions has been synthesized by Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling reaction. These molecules exhibit an exceptionally large and conformationally fixed twist angle of the PBI  &#960;&#8208;  core due to the high steric congestion imparted by the aryl substituents in bay positions. Single crystal X&#8208;ray analyses of phenyl&#8208;, naphthyl&#8208; and pyrenyl&#8208;functionalized PBIs reveal interlocked  &#960;&#8209;&#960;  &#8209;stacking motifs, leading to conformational chirality and the possibility for the isolation of enantiopure atropoisomers by semipreparative HPLC chromatography. The interlocked arrangement endows these molecules with substantial racemization barriers of about 120&#160;kJ&#160;mol  &#8209;1  for the tetraphenyl&#8208; and tetra&#8208;2&#8209;naphthyl&#8208;substituted derivatives, which is among the highest racemization barriers for axially chiral PBIs. Variable temperature NMR studies reveal the presence of a multitude of up to fourteen conformational isomers in solution that are interconverted via smaller activation barriers of about 65 kJ&#160;mol  &#8209;1  . The redox and optical properties of these core&#8208;twisted PBIs have been characterized by cyclic voltammetry, UV/Vis/NIR and fluorescence spectroscopy and their respective atropoenantiomers were further characterized by circular dichroism (CD) and circular polarized luminescence (CPL) spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Native Chemical Ligation&#8208;Based Fluorescent Probes for Cysteine and Aminopeptidase N using meso&#8208;thioester&#8208;BODIPY</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>meso&#8208;Carboxyl&#8208;BODIPY responds to small electronic changes resulting from acyl substitution reactions with a marked change in fluorescence. Herein, the minute changes that accompany the thioester to amide conversion encountered in native chemical ligation (NCL) are exploited in the construction of fluorescent &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; probes. Two fluorogenic probes, 1a and 4, derived from a meso&#8208;thioester&#8208;BODIPY scaffold, were designed for the selective detection of cysteine (1a) and aminopeptidase N (4), respectively. The aromatic (1a) and aliphatic (4) thioesters of meso&#8208;carboxyl&#8208;BODIPY are nonfluorescent. However, specific analyte&#8208;induced conversion to the meso&#8208;amide derivative caused significant spectral changes and a dramatic fluorescence enhancement. Probe 1a exhibited a large fluorescence &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; response with high selectivity toward cysteine via a tandem NCL reaction. Probe 4 was successfully applied to the monitoring and imaging of endogenous aminopeptidase N in live cancer cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer (PCET) with 1,4&#8208;Bisguanidino&#8208;Benzene Derivatives: Comparative Study and Use in Acid&#8208;Initiated C&#8208;H Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) is of key importance in modern synthetic chemistry. Redox&#8208;active guanidines were established by our group as valuable alternatives to toxic high&#8208;potential benzoquinones in a variety of different PCET reactions. In this work, we evaluate the PCET reactivity of a series of 1,4&#8208;bisguanidino&#8208;benzenes varying in their redox potentials and proton affinities. The relevant redox and protonation states are fully characterized and the compounds sorted with respect to their PCET reactivity by comparative PCET experiments supplemented by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. Depending on the studied reactions, the driving force is either electron transfer or proton transfer; thereby the influence of both processes on the overall reactivity could be assessed. Then, two of the PCET reagents are applied in representative oxidative aryl&#8208;aryl coupling reactions, namely the intramolecular coupling of 3,3&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;4,4&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;tetramethoxy&#8208;  o  &#8208;terphenyl to give the corresponding triphenylene, the intermolecular coupling of  N  &#8208;ethylcarbazole to give  N  ,  N  &#8217;&#8208;diethyl&#8208;3,3&#8217;&#8208;bicarbazole, and in the oxidative lactonization of 2&#8208;&#8203;[(4&#8208;&#8203;methoxyphenyl)&#8203;methyl]&#8203;&#8208;benzoic acid. Under mild conditions, the reactions proceed fast and efficient. Only small amounts of acid are needed, in clear contrast to the corresponding coupling reactions with traditional high&#8208;potential benzoquinones such as DDQ or chloranil requiring a large excess of a strong acid.</dc:description>

Then, two of the PCET reagents are applied in representative oxidative aryl-aryl coupling reactions, namely the intramolecular coupling of 3,3&#8217;&#8217;-4,4&#8217;&#8217;-tetramethoxy-  o  -terphenyl to give the corresponding triphenylene, the intermolecular coupling of  N  -ethylcarbazole to give  N  ,  N  &#8217;-diethyl-3,3&#8217;-bicarbazole, and in the oxidative lactonization of 2-&#8203;[(4-&#8203;methoxyphenyl)&#8203;methyl]&#8203;-benzoic acid. Under mild conditions, the reactions proceed fast and efficient. Only small amounts of acid are needed, in clear contrast to the corresponding coupling reactions with traditional high-potential benzoquinones such as DDQ or chloranil requiring a large excess of a strong acid.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Labeling and Probing the Silica Surface Using Mechanochemistry and 17O NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, there has been increasing interest in developing cost&#8208;efficient, fast, and user&#8208;friendly  17  O enrichment protocols to help understand the structure and reactivity of materials using  17  O NMR. Here, we show for the first time how ball milling (BM) can be used to selectively and efficiently enrich the surface of fumed silica, which is widely used at the industrial scale. Short milling times (up to 15 min) allowed modulation of the enrichment level (up to ca. 5%) without significantly changing the nature of the material. High&#8208;precision  17  O&#8208;compositions were measured at different milling times using&#160;large&#8208;geometry secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry&#160; LG&#8208;SIMS. High&#8208;resolution  17  O NMR analyses (including at 35.2 T) allowed clear identification of the signals from siloxane (Si&#8208;O&#8208;Si) and silanols (Si&#8208;OH), while DNP analyses, performed using direct  17  O polarization and indirect  17  O{  1  H} CP excitation, agreed with selective labeling of the surface. Information on the distribution of Si&#8208;OH environments at the surface was obtained from 2D  1  H&#8208;  17  O D&#8208;HMQC correlations. Finally, the surface&#8208;labeled silica was reacted with titania and using  17  O DNP, their common interface was probed and Si&#8208;O&#8208;Ti bonds identified.</dc:description>

         <title>A Fluorescence Sensor Array Based on Zinc(II)&#8208;carboxyamidoquinolines: Toward Quantitative Detection of ATP</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The newly prepared fluorescent carboxyamidoquinolines (  1  &#8211;  3  ) and their Zn(II) complexes (  Zn@1  &#8211;  Zn@3  ) were used to bind and sense various phosphate anions utilizing a relay mechanism, in which the Zn(II) ion migrates from the  Zn@1  &#8211;  Zn@3  complexes to the phosphate, namely adenosine 5&#8217;&#8208;triphosphate (ATP) and pyrophosphate (PPi), a process accompanied by a dramatic change in fluorescence.  Zn@1  &#8211;  Zn@3  assemblies bind adenine nucleotide phosphates while displaying an analyte&#8208;specific response. This process was investigated using UV&#8208;vis, fluorescence and NMR spectroscopy. It is shown that the different binding selectivity and the corresponding fluorescence response enables differentiation of adenosine 5&#8217;&#8208;triphosphate (ATP), adenosine 5&#8217;&#8208;diphosphate (ADP), pyrophosphate (PPi) and phosphate (Pi). The cross&#8208;reactive nature of the carboxyamidoquinolines&#8208;Zn(II) sensors in conjunction with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was utilized in a simple fluorescence chemosensor array that allows for the identification of ATP, ADP, PPi, and Pi from 8 other anions including adenosine 5&#8217;&#8208;monophosphate (AMP) with 100% correct classification. Furthermore, the support vector machine algorithm, a machine learning method, allowed for highly accurate quantitation of ATP in the range 5&#8208;100 &#181;M concentration in unknown samples with error &lt; 2.5%.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion Modulation of Pt&#8208;group Metals and Electrocatalysis Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sustainable development orientation of de&#8208;fossil resources has stimulated a blossoming interest in the design of advanced electrocatalysts for clean energy conversion. The anion modulated strategy for Pt&#8208;group metals (PGMs) by means of anion engineering possesses high flexibility to regulate the electronic structure, providing a promising prospect for constructing electrocatalysts with superior activity and stability to satisfy the future green electrochemical energy conversion system. Based on the previous work of our group and others, in this review, we summarize the up&#8208;to&#8208;date progress on anion&#8208;modulated PGM compounds (such as RuP2, IrP2, PtP2, RuB2, Ru2B3, RuS2, etc.) in energy&#8208;related electrocatalysis from activity origin and synthetic strategies to electrochemical applications including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), N2 reduction reaction (NRR), and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). In the end, the key problems, countermeasures and future development orientations of anion&#8208;modulated PGM compounds toward electrocatalytic applications are proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Uncovering the Hidden Landscape of Tris(4&#8208;pyridyl) Ligands: Topological Complexity Derived from the Bridgehead</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular main group chemistry is a developing field which parallels the conventional domain of metallo&#8208;organic chemistry. Little explored building blocks in this area are main group metal&#8208;based ligands which have the appropriate donor symmetry to build desired molecular or extended arrangements. Tris(pyridyl) main group ligands (E(py) 3 , E = main group metal) are potentially highly versatile building blocks since shifting the N&#8208;donor arms from the 2&#8208; to the 3&#8208;positions and 4&#8208;positions provides a very simple way of changing the ligand character from mononuclear/chelating to multidentate/metal&#8208;bridging. Here we explore the coordination behaviour of the first main group metal tris(4&#8208;pyridyl) ligands, E(4&#8208;py) 3 (E = Sb, Bi, Sn), and their ability to build metal organic frameworks (MOFs). The complicated topology of these MOFs shows a marked influence on the counter anion and on the ability of the E(4&#8208;py) 3 ligands to switch coordination mode, depending on the steric and donor character of the bridgehead. This structure&#8208;directing influence of the bridgehead provides a potential building strategy for future molecular and MOF design in this area.</dc:description>

         <title>Design Strategies of Si/C Composite Anode for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silicon&#8208;based materials that have higher theoretical specific capacity than other conventional anodes, such as carbon materials, Li  2  TiO  3  materials and Sn&#8208;based materials, becomes a hot topic in research of lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB). However, the low conductivity and large volume expansion of silicon&#8208;based materials hinders the commercialization of silicon&#8208;based materials. Until recent years, these issues are alleviated by the combination of carbon based materials. In this review, the preparation of Si/C materials by different synthetic methods in the past decade is reviewed along with their respective advantages and disadvantages. In addition, the research progress of Si/C materials formed by silicon and different carbon based materials is researched, where the influences of carbons on the property modulation of silicon are emphasized. Lastly, future research direction in the material design and optimization of Si/C materials is proposed to fill the current gap in the development of efficient Si/C anode for LIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Quadruple Role of Pd Catalyst in Domino Reaction Involving Aryl to Alkyl 1,5&#8208;Pd Migration to Access 1,9&#8208;Bridged Triptycenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A Pd&#8208;catalyzed domino reaction of 1,8,13&#8208;tribromo&#8208;9&#8208;methoxytriptycenes is reported. Under conventional Suzuki coupling conditions, the triptycenes underwent multiple transformations to give 1,9&#8208;bridged triptycenes. Based on mechanistic investigations, a single Pd catalyst functions as Pd  0  , Pd  II  and Pd  IV  species to catalyze four distinct processes: (1) aryl to alkyl 1,5&#8208;Pd migration, (2) intramolecular arylation, (3) homocoupling of phenylboronic acid and (4) Suzuki coupling. DFT calculations revealed that 1,5&#8208;Pd migration likely proceeds via both concerted Pd  II  and stepwise Pd  IV  routes. Asymmetric synthesis of the chiral triptycenes, as well as optical resolution, and further transformation are also reported.</dc:description>

Asymmetric synthesis of the chiral triptycenes, as well as optical resolution, and further transformation are also reported.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Cationic Polypeptide Supramolecular Nanogels for Intracellular DNA Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular nanogels are an emerging class of polymer nanocarriers for intracellular delivery, owing to their straightforward preparation, biocompatibility, and capability to spontaneously encapsulate biologically active components such as DNA. A completely biodegradable three component cationic supramolecular nanogel was designed exploiting the multivalent host&#8208;guest interaction of cyclodextrin and adamantane attached to a polypeptide backbone. While cyclodextrin was conjugated to linear poly&#8208;L&#8208;lysine, adamantane was grafted to linear as well as star shaped poly&#8208;L&#8208;lysine. Size control of nanogels was obtained with the increase in the length of the host and guest polymer. Moreover, smaller nanogels were obtained using the star shaped polymers because of the compact nature of star polymers compared to linear ones. Nanogels were loaded with anionic model cargoes, pyranine and carboxyfluorescein, and their enzyme responsive release was studied using protease trypsin. Confocal microscopy revealed successful transfection of mammalian HeLa cells and intracellular release of pyranine and plasmid DNA, as quantified using a luciferase assay, showing that supramolecular polypeptide nanogels have significant potential in gene therapy applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Bonding in Barium Boryloxides, Siloxides, Phenoxides and Silazides.&#160;A comparison with the lighter alkaline earths</title>

A diversity of coordination patterns is observed in the solid state for both homoleptic and heteroleptic complexes, with coordination numbers ranging between 2 and 4. The identity of the bridging ligand in heteroleptic dimers [Ba(&#956;2&#8208;X1)(X2)] depends largely on the given pair of ligands X1  and X2  .

The comparison of the structural motifs in the complexes [Ae{&#956;2&#8208;N(SiMe3)2}(OB{CH(SiMe3)2}2)]2  (Ae = Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba) suggest that these observations may be extended to all alkaline earths. DFT calculations highlight the largely prevailing ionic character of ligand&#8208;Ae bonding in all compounds. The ionic character of the Ae&#8208;ligand bond encourages bridging coordination, whereas the number of bridging ligands is controlled by steric factors. DFT computations also indicate that in [Ba(&#956;2&#8208;X1)(X2)] heteroleptic dimers, ligand predilection for bridging vs terminal positions is dictated by the ability to establish secondary interactions between the metals and the ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Pathways of the Extremely Reactive Iron(IV)&#8208;oxido complexes with Tetradentate Bispidine Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The nonheme iron(IV)&#8208;oxido complex  trans&#8208;  N3&#8208;[(L  1  )Fe  IV  =O(Cl)]  +  , where L  1  is a derivative of the tetradentate bispidine 2,4&#8208;di(pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;3,7&#8208;diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane&#8208;1&#8208;one, is known to have an  S  = 1 electronic ground state and to be an extremely reactive oxidant for oxygen atom transfer (OAT) and hydrogen atom abstraction (HAA) processes. Here we show that, in spite of this ferryl oxidant having the &#8220;wrong&#8221; spin ground state, it is the most reactive nonheme iron model system known so far and of a similar order of reactivity as nonheme iron enzymes (C&#8208;H abstraction of cyclohexane, &#8208; 90 &#176;C (propionitrile),  t  1/2  = 3.5 sec). Discussed are spectroscopic and kinetic data, supported by a DFT&#8208;based theoretical analysis, which indicate that substrate oxidation is significantly faster than self&#8208;decay processes due to an intramolecular demethylation pathway and formation of an oxido&#8208;bridged diiron(III) intermediate. It is also shown that the iron(III)&#8208;hydroxido / cyclohexyl radical intermediate, resulting from C&#8208;H abstraction, selectively produces chlorocyclohexane in a rebound process. However, the life&#8208;time of the intermediate is so long that other reaction channels (known as cage escape) become important, and much of the C&#8208;H abstraction therefore is unproductive. In bulk reactions at ambient temperature and at longer time scales, there is formation of significant amounts of oxidation product &#8211; specifically of chlorocyclohexane, and it is shown that this originates from oxidation of the oxido&#8208;bridged diiron(III) resting state.</dc:description>

         <title>Cell&#8208;penetrating Mitochondria&#8208;targeting Ligands for Universal Delivery of Small Molecules, Proteins and Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mitochondria are key organelles that perform vital cellular functions such as cell survival and death. Targeted delivery of different types of cargos to mitochondria is a well&#8208;established strategy to study mitochondrial biology and diseases. Of various existing mitochondria&#8208;transporting vehicles, most of them suffered from poor cytosolic entry, low delivery efficiency, limited cargo types, and cumbersome preparation protocols, and none was known to be universally applicable for mitochondrial delivery of different types of cargos (small molecules, proteins and nanomaterials). Herein, we disclose two new cell&#8208;penetrating mitochondria&#8208;targeting ligands (named MitoLigand), as well as their corresponding chemoselective conjugation chemistry, that are capable of effectively &#8220;tagging&#8221; small&#8208; molecule drugs, native proteins and nanomaterials. Upon successful cellular delivery and rapid endosome escape, the released native cargos were found to be predominantly localized inside mitochondria. Finally, by successfully delivering doxorubicin, a well&#8208;known anticancer drug, to the mitochondria of HeLa cells, we showed the released drug possessed potent cell cytotoxicity, caused disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential and finally led to cell apoptosis. Our strategy thus paves the way for future mitochondria&#8208;targeted therapy with a variety of biologically active agents.</dc:description>

Finally, by successfully delivering doxorubicin, a well-known anticancer drug, to the mitochondria of HeLa cells, we showed the released drug possessed potent cell cytotoxicity, caused disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential and finally led to cell apoptosis. Our strategy thus paves the way for future mitochondria-targeted therapy with a variety of biologically active agents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
