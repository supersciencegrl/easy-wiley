         <title>Electrochemical synthesis of gold&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An electrochemical synthesis of gold(I)&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (Au&#8208;NHC) complexes has been developed. The electrochemical methodology uses only imidazolium salts, gold metal electrodes, and electricity to produce these complexes and the only by&#8208;product is hydrogen gas. This high&#8208;yielding and operationally simple procedure has been used to produce seven mononuclear and three dinuclear Au&#8208;NHC complexes. The electrochemical procedure facilitates a clean reaction with no by&#8208;products. As such, Au&#8208;NHC complexes can be directly transferred to catalytic reactions without work&#8208;up or purification. The Au&#8208;NHC complexes were produced on&#8208;demand and tested as catalysts in a vinylcyclopropanation reaction. All mononuclear Au&#8208;NHC complexes performed similarly to or better than the isolated complexes, showcasing how the electrochemical procedure can speed up catalyst screening and reaction development.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidants Controlled C&#8208;H Bond Functionalization of N&#8208;Aryltetrahydroisoquinolines: The Construction of the Quaternary Carbon Center and Cleavage of the C&#8208;N Bond</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Initiated by triarylamine radical cation salt (TBPA), the direct C&#8208;H bond functionalization of &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;aryltetrahydroisoquinoline esters was smoothly realized, giving a series of &#945;&#8208;hydroxylated derivatives with a quaternary carbon center in good yields. Differently, in the presence of tert&#8208;butyl nitrite (TBN), the C&#8208;N single bond was cleaved to keto esters. The mechanistic study revealed that these reactions were mediated by a similar mechanism, in which the N&#8208;nitrosation might provide a driving force to the C&#8208;N bond cleavage.</dc:description>

         <title>Customized synthesis of MOF nanoplates via molecular scalpel strategy for efficient oxygen reduction in Zn&#8722;air batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The production of metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF) nanoplates with well&#8208;defined geometric morphology is remarkable for expanding their applications. Herein, the cobalt&#8208;based MOF nanoplates with hexagonal channels from a layer&#8208;pillared MOF are accomplished, via a molecular scalpel strategy, utilizing monodentate pyridine to replace the bidentate 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine. The morphology can be modified from nanorods to nanoplates with controllable thickness tuned by the amounts of pyridine. Succeeding carbonization treatment transforms the MOF nanoplates into Co particles homogeneously encapsulated in the nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon layers. The prepared catalyst with a unique platelike morphology displays a high half&#8208;wave potential of 0.88 V in oxygen reduction reaction. When used in primary Zn&#8722;air batteries, it delivers a high peak power density of 280 mW cm&#8722;2. This work clarifies the structure&#8208;morphology&#8208;reactivity connection of MOF nanoplates.</dc:description>

         <title>Control of Relative Positions of Electron&#8208;Donor and Electron&#8208;Acceptor Molecules in Charge&#8208;Transfer Complexes for Luminescent Property Modulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Charge&#8208;transfer complexes can exhibit various physical properties, which depend on the relative positions of electron&#8208;donor and electron&#8208;acceptor molecules. Several studies have investigated the relationship between the relative positions of electron&#8208;donor and electron&#8208;acceptor molecules and their luminescence properties. However, elucidating the pure correlation between the relative positions and detailed luminescence processes without changing their molecular structures has been unexplored. Herein, we report the relative&#8208;position&#8208;control based on charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonds between sulfo and amino groups and on alkylamines&#8217; steric factors, and report concomitant luminescent property modulation. From anthracene&#8208;2,6&#8208;disulfonic acid and 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetracyanobenzene as electron&#8208;donor and electron&#8208;acceptor molecules, and various alkylamines, six charge&#8208;transfer complexes were prepared. Different alkylamines' steric factors drastically and precisely changed the relative positions of the electron&#8208;donor and electron&#8208;acceptor molecules without changing their molecular structures. Consequently, the six crystals exhibited maximum emission wavelengths from 543 to 624 nm and different luminescence processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Bis&#8208;Borylation of Quinolines: The Importance of the Cobalt Triplet State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective tandem quinolines dearomatization/functionalization is a huge challenge. We show here that the low&#8208;valent HCo(N2)(PPh3)3 is able to catalyze such bis&#8208;borylation process. NMR and labelling studies prove a 1,2&#8208;hydroboration/Markovnikov hydroboration cascade, starting from an in&#8197;situ formed paramagnetic complex. DFT highlights the importance of a cobalt triplet state throughout the reaction, and bring rationalizations on the C4 selectivity.







Abstract
We report herein a mild stereo&#8208; and regioselective dearomatization of quinolines using the simple low valent HCo(N2)(PPh3)3 complex that exhibits labile ligands. Conditions to form selectively, at room temperature, high&#8208;valued 1,4&#8208;bis&#8208;borylated tetrahydroquinolines from simple starting heteroaromatic compounds have been developed. The efficient and selective functionalization of a large scope of quinolines bearing various electron&#8208;donating or electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents is presented, as well as the post&#8208;modification of the resulting C&#8722;B bond. NMR and labelling studies are consistent with a cascade mechanism pathway, starting from an in&#8197;situ generated paramagnetic bis&#8208;quinoline cobalt(I) hydride complex. A first quinoline dearomatization followed by a cobalt(I)&#8208;catalyzed Markovnikov hydroboration of the remaining double bond allows the introduction of the boronic ester group only at C4 position. DFT calculations particularly highlight the importance of the cobalt triplet state throughout the reaction pathway, and bring some rationalization for the observed C4 selective borylation.

         <title>Lewis Base&#8208;assisted Arylation of Unsaturated Carbonyls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triple A: Addition&#8208;Assisted Arylation methods which make use of Lewis base&#8208;generated enolates are described in this concept. Different fields of synthetic organic chemistry are covered, including transition metal catalysis, hypervalent main group element&#8208;centered rearrangements and organocatalyzed aryl&#8208;migration reactions. The conceptual similarities and differences are briefly discussed with the goal to apply this strategy in future method development.







Abstract
The combination of Lewis bases with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls allows the in&#8208;situ generation of enolates without the need for strong Br&#248;nsted bases. Recently developed synthetic methods employ this approach for arylation followed by elimination of the Lewis base, regenerating the alkene. This strategy has been deployed for formal &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation in different contexts, namely (a) transition metal catalysis, (b) rearrangement reactions utilizing hypervalent main group elements and (c) organocatalysis. This concept article provides an overview of the developed strategies, highlighting and contextualizing their features.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks as Tailor&#8208;Made Scaffolds for Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water harvesting from the air: three covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were synthesized by incorporating different content of nitrogen. Higher nitrogen content is advantageous to lower their inflection points in water isotherms. The high performance of these COFs validated the feasibility of harnessing this strategy to prepare efficient COFs&#8208;based water harvesters.







Abstract
Developing materials to harvest water from the air is of great importance to alleviate the water shortage for people living in arid regions, where the annual average relative humidity (RH) is lower than 0.4. In this work, we report a general nitrogen atom incorporation strategy to prepare high&#8208;performance covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for water harvesting from the air in arid areas. A series of COFs, namely COF&#8208;W1, COF&#8208;W2, and COF&#8208;W3 were developed for this purpose. Different contents of nitrogen were embedded into COFs by incorporating pyridine units into the building blocks. With the increasing content of nitrogen from COF&#8208;W1 to COF&#8208;W3, the inflection points of their water isotherms shift distinctly from RH values from 0.65 to 0.25. Significantly, COF&#8208;W3 exhibits the lowest inflection point at a low RH value of 0.25 and reaches a high uptake capacity of 0.28&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C with a low hysteresis loop. Moreover, the gram&#8208;scale COF&#8208;W3 retains its high performance, which renders it more attractive in water harvesting. This work demonstrates the feasibility of this nitrogen incorporation strategy to acquire high&#8208;performance COFs as water harvesters in the future.

         <title>Tailoring Secondary Coordination Sphere Effects in Single&#8208;metal&#8208;site Catalysts by Surface Immobilization of Supramolecular Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cage control: Surface immobilization of supramolecular cages gives control over the first&#8208; and second coordination spheres of heterogeneous catalysts, enabling diffusion&#8208;controlled reaction kinetics.







Abstract
Controlling the coordination sphere of heterogeneous single&#8208;metal&#8208;site catalysts is a powerful strategy for fine&#8208;tuning their catalytic properties but is fairly difficult to achieve. To address this problem, we immobilized supramolecular cages where the primary&#8208; and secondary coordination sphere are controlled by ligand design. The kinetics of these catalysts were studied in a model reaction, the hydrolysis of ammonia borane, over a temperature range using fast and precise online measurements generating high&#8208;precision Arrhenius plots. The results show how catalytic properties can be enhanced by placing a well&#8208;defined reaction pocket around the active site. Our fine&#8208;tuning yielded a catalyst with such performance that the reaction kinetics are diffusion&#8208;controlled rather than chemically controlled.

         <title>Cd/Cd(OH)2 Nanosheets Enhancing the Electrocatalytic Activity of CO2 Reduction to CO</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cd/Cd(OH)2/CP electrode could efficiently electrocatalytic reduce CO2 to CO in CO2&#8208;saturated 30&#8197;wt% [Bmim]PF6&#8208;65&#8197;wt% CH3CN&#8208;5&#8197;wt% H2O electrolyte. The outstanding electrocatalytic performance of the Cd/Cd(OH)2/CP electrode was closely associated with its unique structural properties, suitable OH groups, perfect interaction with electrolyte, abundant active sites and fast electron transfer rate.







Abstract
Electric&#8208;driven conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) to carbon monoxide (CO) under mild reaction conditions offers a promising approach to mitigate the greenhouse effect and the energy crisis. Surface engineering is believed to be one of the prospective methods for enhancing the electrocatalytic activity of CO2 reduction. Herein, hydroxyl (OH) groups were successfully introduced to cadmium nanosheets to form cadmium and cadmium hydroxide nanocomposites (i.&#8201;e. Cd/Cd(OH)2 nanosheets) via a facile two&#8208;step method. The as&#8208;prepared Cd/Cd(OH)2/CP (CP indicates carbon paper) electrode displays excellent electrocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction to produce CO. The Faradaic efficiency of CO reaches 98.3&#8201;% and the current density achieves 23.8&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;2.0&#8197;V vs. Ag/Ag+ in a CO2&#8208;saturated 30&#8197;wt% 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazole hexafluorophosphate ([Bmim]PF6)&#8208;65&#8197;wt% acetonitrile (CH3CN)&#8208;5&#8197;wt% water (H2O) electrolyte. And the CO partial current density can reach up to 71.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with the CO Faradaic efficiency of more than 85&#8201;% at &#8722;2.3&#8197;V vs. Ag/Ag+, which stands out against Cd/CP, Cd(OH)2/CP, and Cd/CdO/CP electrodes. The excellent electrocatalytic performance of the Cd/Cd(OH)2/CP electrode can be attributed to its unique structural properties, suitable OH groups, perfect interaction with electrolyte, abundant active sites and fast electron transfer rate.

         <title>Molecular Recognition Process in Resorcinarene&#8208;based Coordination Capsules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu and Ag capsules accommodate various organic molecules. We investigated the processes by which these capsules perform molecular recognition utilizing a molecular probe. It was found that partial dissociation is a major molecular recognition process, while in some cases, slippage also contributes to host&#8208;guest complexation.







Abstract
Cu and Ag capsules can take up various organic molecules. Their molecular recognition possibly involves partial dissociation and slippage. We investigated molecular recognition processes in the Cu and Ag capsules by CD and 1H NMR spectroscopy and employed 4,4&#8217;&#8208;diacetoxy biphenyl carrying two benzothiadiazole groups as a probe. CD and 1H NMR measurements reveal that the host&#8208;guest complexation proceeds under second&#8208;order reactions and that these capsules undergo the partial dissociation to take up the probe in [D1]chloroform and [D8]THF. The slippage also contributes to host&#8208;guest complexation for a Cu capsule that carries p&#8208;methoxyphenyl groups on the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridiyl arms. DFT calculations suggest that &#960;/&#960; stacking interactions between the electron&#8208;rich p&#8208;methoxyphenyl group and the electron&#8208;poor 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridyl arm elongate the capsule, allowing the guest to access the cavity without the partial dissociation.

CD and &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR measurements reveal that the host-guest complexation proceeds under second-order reactions and that these capsules undergo the partial dissociation to take up the probe in [D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]chloroform and [D&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]THF. The slippage also contributes to host-guest complexation for a Cu capsule that carries &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-methoxyphenyl groups on the 2,2&#8217;-bipyridiyl arms. DFT calculations suggest that &#960;/&#960; stacking interactions between the electron-rich &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-methoxyphenyl group and the electron-poor 2,2&#8217;-bipyridyl arm elongate the capsule, allowing the guest to access the cavity without the partial dissociation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Ru Nanoboxes with a Hexagonal Close&#8208;Packed Structure by Templating with Ag Nanocubes and Their Catalytic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boxing clever: We report a facile synthesis of Ag&#8722;Ru core&#8722;shell nanocubes and then Ru nanoboxes by templating with Ag nanocubes. The nanoboxes show high catalytic activity toward the hydrogenation of 4&#8208;nitrophenol by NaBH4.







Abstract
Noble&#8208;metal nanoboxes offer an attractive form of nanomaterials for catalytic applications owing to their open structure and highly efficient use of atoms. Herein, we report the facile synthesis of Ag&#8722;Ru core&#8722;shell nanocubes and then Ru nanoboxes with a hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp) structure, as well as evaluation of their catalytic activity toward a model hydrogenation reaction. By adding a solution of Ru(acac)3 in ethylene glycol (EG) dropwise to a suspension of silver nanocubes in EG at 170&#8201;&#176;C, Ru atoms are generated and deposited onto the entire surface of a nanocube. As the volume of the RuIII precursor is increased, Ru atoms are also produced through a galvanic replacement reaction, generating Ag&#8722;Ru nanocubes with a hollow interior. The released Ag+ ions are then reduced by EG and deposited back onto the nanocubes. By selectively etching away the remaining Ag with aqueous HNO3, the as&#8208;obtained Ag&#8722;Ru nanocubes are transformed into Ru nanoboxes, whose walls are characterized by an hcp structure and an ultrathin thickness of a few nanometers. Finally, we evaluated the catalytic properties of the Ru nanoboxes with two different wall thicknesses by using a model hydrogenation reaction; both samples showed excellent performance.

         <title>Second Generation of Near&#8208;Infrared Cyanine&#8208;Based Photocatalysts for Faster Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A second generation of cyanine&#8208;based near&#8208;infrared photocatalysts has been developed to accelerate organic transformations. Cyanines were prepared and fully characterized prior to evaluation of their photocatalytic activities in oxidation (aza&#8208;Henry reaction) and reduction (trifluoromethylation of alkene).







Abstract
A second generation of cyanine&#8208;based near&#8208;infrared photocatalysts has been developed to accelerate organic transformations. Cyanines were prepared and fully characterized prior to evaluation of their photocatalytic activities. Catalyst efficiency was determined by using two model oxidation and reduction reactions. For the aza&#8208;Henry reaction, cyanines bearing an amino group on the heptamethine chain led to the best results. For trifluoromethylation, the stability of the photocatalyst was found to be the key parameter for efficient and rapid conversion.

         <title>A Living Topochemical Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Achiral Amino Acid N&#8208;Carboxy&#8208;Anhydrides in Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The single&#8208;crystal ring&#8208;opening polymerization of &#945;&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid&#8208; (Aib) and 1&#8208;aminocyclohexanecarboxylic acid&#8208; (ACHC) N&#8208;carboxyanhydrides (NCAs) is reported. Topochemical, living ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of these achiral amino&#8208;acid NCAs produces polymers of highest purity with increased chain length and high end&#8208;group fidelity as compared to conventional solution polymerization.







Abstract
A living topochemical ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of achiral amino&#8208;acid N&#8208;carboxyanhydrides (NCAs) is reported. Single crystals of the NCAs of &#945;&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) and 1&#8208;aminocyclohexanecarboxylic acid (ACHC) were grown, allowing a ring&#8208;opening polymerization macroscopically induced by amines. The single crystals could be polymerized at temperatures from 25&#8211;50&#8201;&#176;C after physically contacting the amine&#8208;based initiator with the crystals. Topochemical polymerization of the crystals was proven by MALDI&#8208;ToF MS and XRD, generating polymers with chain lengths of up to 40&#8197;units and a complete affixation of the initiating amine at the polymer's head. Due to the proper alignment of the reacting groups in the crystal, longer polymer chains with improved purities can be reached, as chain&#8208;transfer is reduced as compared to solution polymerization. Simple purification of the polymers can be achieved by separation of the unreacted NCA via dispersion in acetonitrile. Overall, this method enables the preparation of polymers with higher chain length and purities at mild conditions, finally demonstrating a crystal&#8208;based ring opening polymerization.

         <title>Long&#8208;range Through&#8208;space Charge Transfer in a pH&#8208;responsive Mixed Cyclophane of Pyridine and Teropyrene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;distance relationship: two aromatic systems do not need to inhabit the same space to maintain a meaningful connection, as evidenced by the long&#8208;range (&gt;5&#8197;&#197;), through&#8208;space charge transfer that arises upon protonation of the pyridine unit in a mixed [3.3]cyclophane containing a rainbow&#8208;shaped teropyrene and a pyridine nested in its arc.







Abstract
A large, strained (SE=44.2&#8197;kcal/mol) and conformationally flexible mixed cyclophane of pyridine and teropyrene was synthesized using two intramolecular Wurtz coupling reactions and an unprecedented Scholl reaction between the unreactive 2 positions of the pyrene systems in a triply bridged pyrenophane. Protonation of the pyridine unit results in a greatly enhanced preference for nesting in the cavity of the highly bent teropyrene system (&#952;calc=162.6&#176;) and emergence of a charge transfer absorption band (&#955;max=592&#8197;nm) due to a long range (5.0&#8211;5.5&#8197;&#197;), through&#8208;space intramolecular transition between the teropyrene and pyridinium units, which does not exist in the neutral cyclophane.

         <title>Bis(N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene) Manganese(I) Complexes in Catalytic N&#8208;Formylation/N&#8208;Methylation of Amines Using Carbon Dioxide and Phenylsilane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mn(I) complexes of the type [MnBr(bisNHC)(CO)3], bearing a bidentate bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) ligand (bisNHC), have been synthesized by transmetalation of the bisNHC from the corresponding silver(I) complexes, and fully characterized in solution and in the solid state. The catalytic performances of the complexes have been evaluated in the reductive formylation and methylation of anilines with CO2.







Abstract
A series of six Mn(I) complexes with general formula [MnBr(bisNHC)(CO)3], having a bidentate bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) ligand (bisNHC), has been developed by varying the bridging group between the NHC donors, the nitrogen wingtip substituents and the heterocyclic ring. The synthesis of the complexes has been accomplished by in&#8197;situ transmetalation of the bisNHC from the corresponding silver(I) complexes. Removal of the bromide anion affords the corresponding solvento complexes [Mn(bisNHC)(CO)3(CH3CN)](BF4). The influence of the bisNHC structure on its electron donor ability has been evaluated by FTIR and 13C NMR spectroscopy, both in the neutral and cationic complexes. Finally, the isolated Mn(I)&#8208;bisNHC complexes have been employed as homogeneous catalysts in the reductive N&#8208;formylation and N&#8208;methylation of amines with CO2 as C1 source and phenylsilane as reducing agent, showing a high selectivity for the N&#8208;methylated product. Preliminary mechanistic investigations suggest that, in the adopted reaction conditions, the formylated product can be formed via different reaction pathways, either metal&#8208;catalyzed or not, while the methylation reaction requires the use of the Mn(I) catalyst.

The catalytic performances of the complexes have been evaluated in the reductive formylation and methylation of anilines with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of six Mn(I) complexes with general formula [MnBr(bisNHC)(CO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;], having a bidentate bis(&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic carbene) ligand (bisNHC), has been developed by varying the bridging group between the NHC donors, the nitrogen wingtip substituents and the heterocyclic ring. The synthesis of the complexes has been accomplished by &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;situ&lt;/i&gt; transmetalation of the bisNHC from the corresponding silver(I) complexes. Removal of the bromide anion affords the corresponding solvento complexes [Mn(bisNHC)(CO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN)](BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). The influence of the bisNHC structure on its electron donor ability has been evaluated by FTIR and &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR spectroscopy, both in the neutral and cationic complexes. Finally, the isolated Mn(I)-bisNHC complexes have been employed as homogeneous catalysts in the reductive &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-formylation and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methylation of amines with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as C1 source and phenylsilane as reducing agent, showing a high selectivity for the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methylated product. Preliminary mechanistic investigations suggest that, in the adopted reaction conditions, the formylated product can be formed via different reaction pathways, either metal-catalyzed or not, while the methylation reaction requires the use of the Mn(I) catalyst.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biomass Separators as a &#8220;Lifesaver&#8221; for Safe and Long&#8208;Life Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review describes the application of biomass materials in lithium&#8208;metal battery separators. Three types of separators are outlined and the different mechanisms of biomass separators with different structures in inhibiting the generation of lithium dendrites and shuttle effect are described.







Abstract
The growth of lithium dendrites and the shuttle of polysulfides in lithium metal batteries (LMBs) have hindered their development. In LMBs, the cathode and anode are separated by a separator, although this does not solve the battery&#8216;s issues. The use of biomass materials is widespread for modifying the separator due to their porous structure and abundant functional groups. LMBs perform more electrochemically when lithium ions are deposited uniformly and polysulfide shuttling is reduced using biomass separators. In this review, we analyze the growth of lithium dendrite and the shuttle of polysulfide in LMBs, summarize the types of biomass separator materials and the mechanisms of action (providing mechanical barriers, promoting uniform deposition of metal ions, capturing polysulfides, shielding polysulfide). The prospect of developing new separator materials from the perspective of regulating ion transport and physical sieving efficiency as well as the application of advanced technologies such as synchrotron radiation to characterize the mechanism of action of biomass separators is also proposed.

         <title>A Rising Star: Luminescent Carbene&#8208;Metal&#8208;Amide Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 59, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept article on luminescent carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;amide (CMA) complexes is presented in terms of molecular design strategies, structure&#8208;property correlations and their applications in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The future directions and opportunities for advancing the development of CMA complexes and the related OLEDs are proposed as well.







Abstract
Coinage metal (gold, silver, and copper) complexes are attractive candidates to substitute the widely studied noble metal complexes, such as, iridium(III) and platinum(II), as luminescent materials in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, the development of coinage metal complexes exhibiting high emission quantum yields and short exciton lifetimes is still a formidable challenge. In the past few years, coinage metal complexes featuring a carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;amide (CMA) motif have emerged as a new class of luminescent materials in OLEDs. Thanks to the coinage metal&#8208;bridged linear geometry, coplanar conformation, and the formation of excited states with dominant ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer character and reduced metal d&#8208;orbital participation, most CMA complexes have high radiative rates via thermally activated delayed fluorescence. Currently, the family of CMA complexes have rapidly evolved and remarkable progresses in CMA&#8208;based OLEDs have been made. Here, a Concept article on CMA complexes is presented, with a focus on molecular design principles, the correlation between molecular structure/conformation and optoelectronic properties, as well as OLED performance. The future prospects of CMA complexes are also discussed.

         <title>Elucidation of Substituent&#8208;Responsive Reactivities via Hierarchical and Asymmetric Assemblies in Crystalline p&#8208;Quinodimethane Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 59, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituent&#8208;responsive reactivities of p&#8208;quinodimethane derivatives with four ester groups in the crystals were elucidated by analyzing crystal structures through their hierarchical and asymmetric assemblies; conformers, dimers, 1D&#8208;columns, 2D&#8208;sheets, and 3D&#8208;stacked sheets (3D&#8208;crystals) and intermolecular interaction energies among neighbored molecules with DFT calculations.







Abstract
We propose a mechanism for substituent&#8208;responsive reactivities of p&#8208;quinodimethane derivatives with four ester groups through their hierarchical and asymmetric assembly modes. Four asymmetric 7,8,8&#8208;tris(methoxycarbonyl)&#8208;p&#8208;quinodimethanes with a 7&#8208;positioned ethoxycarbonyl (2&#8201;a(H)), 2&#8217;&#8208;fluoroethoxycarbonyl (2&#8201;b(F)), 2&#8217;&#8208;chloroethoxycarbonyl (2&#8201;c(Cl)), or 2&#8217;&#8208;bromoethoxycarbonyl (2&#8201;d(Br)) were synthesized and crystallized. 2&#8201;a(H), 2&#8201;b(F) and 2&#8201;d(Br) afforded only one shape crystal, while 2&#8201;c(Cl) did two polymorphic 2&#8201;c(Cl)&#8208;&#945; and 2&#8201;c(Cl)&#8208;&#946;. UV&#8208;irradiation induced topochemical polymerization for 2&#8201;a(H), no reactions for 2&#8201;b(F) and 2&#8201;c(Cl)&#8208;&#945;, and [6+6] photocycloaddition dimerization for 2&#8201;c(Cl)&#8208;&#946; and 2&#8201;d(Br). Such substituent&#8208;responsive reactivities and crystal structures were compared with those of the known symmetric 7,7,8,8&#8208;tetrakis(alkoxycarbonyl)&#8208;p&#8208;quinodimethanes such as 7,7,8,8&#8208;tetrakis(methoxycarbonyl)&#8208; (1&#8201;a(Me)&#8208;&#945; and 1&#8201;a(Me)&#8208;&#946;), 7,7,8,8&#8208;tetrakis(ethoxycarbonyl)&#8208; (1&#8201;b(Et)), and 7,7,8,8&#8208;tetrakis(bromoethoxycarbonyl)&#8208; (1&#8201;c(BrEt)). The comparative study clarified that the reactivities and crystal structures are classified into four types that link to each other. This linkage is understandable when we analyze the crystal structures through the following hierarchical and asymmetric assemblies; conformers, dimers, one dimensional (1D)&#8208;columns, two dimensional (2D)&#8208;sheets, and three dimensional (3D)&#8208;stacked sheets (3D&#8208;crystals). This supramolecular viewpoint is supported by intermolecular interaction energies among neighbored molecules with the density functional theory (DFT) calculation. Such research enables us to elucidate the substituent&#8208;responsive reactivities of the crystals, and reminds us of the selection of the right path in a so&#8208;called &#8220;maze game&#8221;.

         <title>An Acid&#8208;Controlled Method for the Regioselective Functionalization of Anilines over Aliphatic Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 59, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regioselective functionalization of anilines in the presence of aliphatic amines is illustrated utilizing classic conditions for the Baeyer&#8208;Mills reaction. Further, the defined principles of reactivity are shown to be broadly extended to other electrophiles.







Abstract
Regioselective transformations at similar functional groups are of paramount importance in organic synthesis. Traditional strategies towards regioselective functionalization include serial protection/deprotection and sequential synthesis. Modern organic synthesis emphasizes pathway efficiency and protecting group free routes with a goal of exploiting inherent differences in reactivity. This study reports a method for the regioselective functionalization of anilines over aliphatic amines. Utilizing classic conditions for the Baeyer&#8208;Mills reaction, anilines were shown to react preferentially in the presence of aliphatic amines. Subsequently, this principle of reactivity was extended to other electrophiles and conditions.

Utilizing classic conditions for the Baeyer-Mills reaction, anilines were shown to react preferentially in the presence of aliphatic amines. Subsequently, this principle of reactivity was extended to other electrophiles and conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Mixed&#8208;metal oxo&#8208;alkoxide clusters [(MIICl)2(VIVO)2{((HOCH2CH2)(H)N(CH2CH2O))(HN(CH2CH2O)2)}2] (M=Co, Zn) containing a lacunary double cubane oxometallic core incorporating diethanolamine ligands in unusual bonding modes have been prepared and fully characterized by spectroscopic methods, magnetic susceptibility measurement, DFT and ab initio computational methods, and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction structure analysis.







Abstract
Organofunctionalized tetranuclear clusters [(MIICl)2(VIVO)2{((HOCH2CH2)(H)N(CH2CH2O))(HN(CH2CH2O)2)}2] (1, M=Co, 2: M=Zn) containing an unprecedented oxometallacyclic {M2V2Cl2N4O8} (M=Co, Zn) framework have been prepared by solvothermal reactions. The new oxo&#8208;alkoxide compounds were fully characterized by spectroscopic methods, magnetic susceptibility measurement, DFT and ab initio computational methods, and complete single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction structure analysis. The isostructural clusters are formed of edge&#8208;sharing octahedral {VO5N} and trigonal bipyramidal {MO3NCl} units. Diethanolamine ligates the bimetallic lacunary double cubane core of 1 and 2 in an unusual two&#8208;mode fashion, unobserved previously. In the crystalline state, the clusters of 1 and 2 are joined by hydrogen bonds to form a three&#8208;dimensional network structure. Magnetic susceptibility data indicate weakly antiferromagnetic interactions between the vanadium centers [Jiso(VIV&#8722;VIV)=&#8722;5.4(1); &#8722;3.9(2) cm&#8722;1], and inequivalent antiferromagnetic interactions between the cobalt and vanadium centers [Jiso (VIV&#8722;CoII)=&#8722;12.6 and &#8722;7.5&#8197;cm&#8722;1] contained in 1.

         <title>Germylenes Exhibiting Solid&#8208;State Emissions that Extend to NIR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 59, October 23, 2023. </description>

Solid&#8208;state photoluminescence of low&#8208;valent main group element compounds is investigated for the first time using stable germylene carboxylates. Apart from showing room&#8208;temperature photoluminescence, these carboxylates exhibited significant differences in their solid&#8208; and solution&#8208;state emissions.







Abstract
Low&#8208;valent main group compounds that fluoresce in the solid&#8208;state were previously unknown. To address this, we investigated room&#8208;temperature photoluminescence from a series of crystals of germylenes 3&#8211;8 in this article; they exhibited emissions nearly reaching the NIR. Germylene carboxylates (3&#8211;8) were synthesized by reacting dipyrromethene stabilized germylene pyrrolide (2) with carboxylic acids such as acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, benzoic acid, p&#8208;cyanobenzoic acid, p&#8208;nitrobenzoic acid, and acetylsalicylic acid.

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Intramolecular Michael Addition by In Situ Generated Aminoisobenzofulvenes: Construction of Spiro Quaternary Carbon Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 59, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we described organocatalytic spirocyclization of keto&#8208;enone tethered enals via a reductive Michael/aldol condensation/Michael domino sequence. This method granted us access to the architecturally complex spirocyclic spiroindene&#8208;2&#8208;caboxaldehyde frameworks with excellent selectivities (up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr and 99&#8201;%&#8201;ee) and good to moderate yields. Formation of aminoisobenzofulvenes was a key intermediate for intramolecular Michael addition as final spirocyclization step.







Abstract
An unprecedented enantioselective organocatalytic spirocyclization strategy is presented by in&#8197;situ generation of aminoisobezofulvenes. The reaction sequence involves a reductive Michael/aldol&#8208;condensation/Michael addition cascade by iminium&#8208;enamine catalysis. The key success of this spirocyclization was the formation of intermediatory nucleophilic aminoisobenzofuvenes accountable for intramolecular Michael addition. Benzospirononanes featuring an all carbon qauternary spirocenter were obtained using proline&#8208;derived amino&#8208;organocatalyst in moderate to good yields and excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr, and 99&#8201;%&#8201;ee). Post&#8208;methodological manipulation of benzospirononanes was also demonstrated.

         <title>Photoinduced NiH Catalysis with Trialkylamines for the Stereodivergent Transfer Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 59, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual nickel and photoredox catalysis enables the semi&#8208;reduction of internal aryl alkynes in the presence of a trialkylamine acting both as a reductive quencher and as a transfer hydrogenation reagent. The E/Z&#8208;stereoselectivity can be controlled with the aid of an alcohol additive.







Abstract
We report a selectivity&#8208;switchable nickel hydride&#8208;catalyzed methodology that enables the stereocontrolled semi&#8208;reduction of internal alkynes to E&#8208; or Z&#8208;alkenes under very mild conditions. The proposed transfer semi&#8208;hydrogenation process involves the use of a dual nickel/photoredox catalytic system and triethylamine, not only as a sacrificial reductant, but also as a source of hydrogen atoms. Mechanistic studies revealed a pathway involving photo&#8208;induced generation of nickel hydride, syn&#8208;hydronickelation of alkyne, and alkenylnickel isomerization as key steps. Remarkably, mechanistic experiments indicate that the control of the stereoselectivity is not ensuing from a post&#8208;reduction alkene photoisomerization under our conditions. Instead, we demonstrate that the stereoselectivity of the reaction is dependent on the rate of a final protonolysis step which can be tuned by adjusting the pKa of an alcohol additive.

         <title>Protein Sequencing with Artificial Intelligence: Machine Learning Integrated Phosphorene Nanoslit</title>

Machine learning integrated phosphorene nanoslit for high throughput protein sequencing based on the transverse tunneling current approach is presented herein. The findings reveal that materials with a puckered geometry outperform planar ones, offering exciting new possibilities for more accurate and efficient protein sequencing.







Abstract
Achieving high throughput protein sequencing at single molecule resolution remains a daunting challenge. Herein, relying on a solid&#8208;state 2D phosphorene nanoslit device, an extraordinary biosensor to rapidly identify the key signatures of all twenty amino acids using an interpretable machine learning (ML) model is reported. The XGBoost regression algorithm allows the determination of the transmission function of all twenty amino acids with high accuracy. The resultant ML and DFT studies reveal that it is possible to identify individual amino acids through transmission and current signals readouts with high sensitivity and selectivity. Moreover, we thoroughly compared our results to those from graphene nanoslit and found that the phosphorene nanoslit device can be an ideal candidate for protein sequencing up to a 20&#8208;fold increase in transmission sensitivity. The present study facilitates high throughput screening of all twenty amino acids and can be further extended to other biomolecules for disease diagnosis and therapeutic decision making.

         <title>The Role of Inverted Ligand Field in the Electronic Structure and Reactivity of Octahedral Formal Platinum (IV) Complexes
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 59, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic structure of octahedral platinum complexes with halogens or chalcogens was revised in the framework of the Inverted Ligand Field. The formal IV platinum oxidation state was in no case supported except in combination with oxygen and fluorine. A new interpretation of the oxidative addition process was also provided.







Abstract
Platinum complexes are ubiquitous in chemistry and largely used as catalysts or as precursors in drug chemistry, thus a deep knowledge of their electronic properties may help in planning new synthetic strategies or exploring new potential applications. Herein, the electronic structure of many octahedral platinum complexes is drastically revised especially when they feature electronegative elements such as halogens and chalcogens. The investigation revealed that in most cases the five d platinum orbitals are invariably full, thus the empty antibonding orbitals, usually localized on the metal, are mainly centered on the ligands, suggesting a questionable assignment of formal oxidation state IV. The analysis supports the occurrence of the inverted ligand field theory in all cases with the only exceptions of the Pt&#8722;F and Pt&#8722;O bonding. The trends for the molecular complexes are mirrored also by the density of states plots of extended structures featuring octahedral platinum moieties in association with chalcogens atoms. Finally, the oxidative addition of a Se&#8722;Cl linkage to a square platinum complex to achieve an octahedral moiety has been revised in the framework of the inverted ligand field.

Spin injection on graphene. Tyrosine radicals were covalently attached on graphene and graphene oxide. The tyrosine functionalized graphene products showed increased spin concentration, elevated aromaticity, and conductivity.







Abstract
In this article, the enrichment of graphene and graphene oxide with free radicals through their functionalization with tyrosine is studied. In contrast with what is commonly observed in the functionalization of graphene with organic species the addition of tyrosine radicals on to the graphene substrate led to a remarkable increase of the aromatic character as indicated by the spectroscopic data. Similar behaviour was observed for the functionalization of graphene oxide. In addition, a brief analysis of the tyrosine functionalized graphene with EPR spectroscopy showed a remarkable enhancement of the spin density that could be useful in spintronics.

         <title>Structural Insight on Supramolecular Polyion Salts: Inositol Hexaphosphate Enclosed in Cationic Macrocyclic Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 59, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phytate, myo&#8208;inositol&#8208;1,2,3,4,5,6&#8208;hexakisphosphate (depicted by the turtle), is an important bioanion that plays multiple roles in metabolic processes. Supramolecular macrocyclic forces have been used to trap phytate, resulting in insight to its intramolecular and intermolecular interactions at the microenvironment level. Results indicate that an axial phosphate and proton interchange play important structural roles with changing environment.







Abstract
Supramolecular macrocyclic forces have been used to trap phytate, myo&#8208;inositol&#8208;1,2,3,4,5,6&#8208;hexakisphosphate, a key bioanion with multiple roles in metabolic processes. Due to the complex chemistry of six multivalent phosphates surrounding the small, cyclic inositol framework, crystallographic information of simple phytate salts has been elusive. This report represents a combined crystallographic, theoretical, and solution binding investigation of a supramolecular macrocyclic complex of phytate. Together, the results provide significant insight to phytate's intramolecular and intermolecular interactions at the microenvironment level. The macrocycle&#8208;phytate aggregates consist of phytate anionic pairs, each partly sandwiched by two 24&#8208;membered, amide/amine&#8208;based cationic macrocycles. The phytate ion pairs hold the tetrameric macrocyclic array together by six strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Both phytates crystallize in 1a5e phosphate conformations (one axial (P2) and five equatorial phosphates). Solution NMR binding studies in 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 DMSO&#8208;d6&#8201;:&#8201;D2O indicate 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 macrocycle:phytate associations, suggesting that the sandwich&#8208;like nature of the complex holds together in solution. DFT studies indicate the likely occurrence of dynamic intramolecular interchange of phosphate protons, as well as important roles for the axial (P2) phosphate in both intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions.

         <title>Regime Switch in the Dual&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling of Alkyl Silicates with Aryl Bromides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 59, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metallophotoredox catalyzed coupling of an aryl bromide with an alkyl bis(catecholato)silicate can lead to the formation of large quantity of side products when subjected to high intensity/high frequency irradiation. Two regimes were found to be possible; the ability to switch from the quantitative coupling to the simultaneous coupling and degradation of the silicate was observed.







Abstract
Metallaphotoredox catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of an arylbromide (Ar&#8722;Br) with an alkyl bis(catecholato)silicate (R&#8722;Si&#8854;) has been analyzed in depth using a continuum of analytical techniques (EPR, fluorine NMR, electrochemistry, photophysics) and modeling (micro&#8208;kinetics and DFT calculations). These studies converged on the impact of four control parameters consisting in the initial concentrations of the iridium photocatalyst ([Ir]0), nickel precatalyst ([Ni]0) and silicate ([R&#8722;Si&#8854;]0) as well as light intensity I0 for an efficient reaction between Ar&#8722;Br and R&#8722;Si&#8854;. More precisely, two regimes were found to be possibly at play. The first one relies on an equimolar consumption of Ar&#8722;Br with R&#8722;Si&#8854; smoothly leading to Ar&#8722;R, with no side&#8208;product from R&#8722;Si&#8854; and a second one in which R&#8722;Si&#8854; is simultaneously coupled to Ar&#8722;Br and degraded to R&#8722;H. This integrative approach could serve as a case study for the investigation of other metallaphotoredox catalysis manifolds of synthetic significance.

&lt;/i&gt; for an efficient reaction between Ar&#8722;Br and R&#8722;Si&lt;sup&gt;&#8854;&lt;/sup&gt;. More precisely, two regimes were found to be possibly at play. The first one relies on an equimolar consumption of Ar&#8722;Br with R&#8722;Si&lt;sup&gt;&#8854;&lt;/sup&gt; smoothly leading to Ar&#8722;R, with no side-product from R&#8722;Si&lt;sup&gt;&#8854;&lt;/sup&gt; and a second one in which R&#8722;Si&lt;sup&gt;&#8854;&lt;/sup&gt; is simultaneously coupled to Ar&#8722;Br and degraded to R&#8722;H. This integrative approach could serve as a case study for the investigation of other metallaphotoredox catalysis manifolds of synthetic significance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Base&#8208;Stabilized Phosphinidene Oxide, Imide and Sulfide</title>

Base&#8208;stabilized phosphinidene was used to prepare phosphinidene oxide, imide and sulfide. Labile phosphinidene oxide and imide were trapped with p&#8208;tolyl isocyanate, the mechanism of the process was elaborated by DFT calculations. Phosphinidene sulfide was isolated and structurally characterized.







Abstract
Oxidation of a base&#8208;stabilized phosphinidene (&#954;2&#8208;NNP)P (12, NNP=phosphinoamidinate) with N2O afforded a labile phosphinidene oxide (&#954;2&#8208;NNP)P=O (16) which was characterized by NMR spectroscopy. Further oxidation of 16 by N2O or reaction of 12 with two equivalents of pyridine oxide afforded the isolable dioxide (&#954;2&#8208;NNP)PO2 which was characterized by NMR and SC XRD. Trapping of 16 with tolyl isocyanate resulted in P=O/N=C metathesis, eventually affording a urea&#8208;ligated phosphine (&#954;1&#8208;NNP)P(NTol)2C=O (17) The mechanism of this reaction was elucidated by DFT calculations. Reactions of phosphinidene 12 with azides generated transient imines (NNP)P=NR, which in the case of R=Tol underwent cycloaddition with tolyl Isocyanate to afford the urea product 17, and in the case of R=SiMe3 reacts with N3SiMe3 via the addition of N&#8722;Si across the P=N bond affording, after the extrusion of dinitrogen, a P,N&#8208;heterocyclic compound. Both products of the reactions with azides have been fully characterized, both in solution and the solid&#8208;state. Finally, reaction of phosphinidene 12 with one equivalent of sulfur resulted in the isolation of the base&#8208;stabilized phosphinidene sulfide (&#954;2&#8208;NNP)P=S that has also been fully characterized.

         <title>Diaroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene Acetals: Red&#8208;Shifted Solid&#8208;State and Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emitters from a One&#8208;Pot Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 59, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By exploiting the nucleophilicity of aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals, 23 diaroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals can be accessed, although the aroylation leads to a significant bathochromic shift both in the solid and aggregated states as well as an increase in aggregate stability. Cyclized aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals can easily be converted into pyrazole systems in a one&#8208;pot synthesis.







Abstract
Symmetric and unsymmetric diaroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals can be readily accessed in consecutive syntheses in good to excellent yields by exploiting the inherent nucleophilic character of the methine position. Different aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals as well as acid chlorides yield a library of 19 diaroyl compounds with substitution and linker pattern&#8208;tunable emission properties, leading to a significant red&#8208;shift of emission in the solid and aggregated state, which was thoroughly investigated. Additionally, the stability of the luminescent aggregates is highly increased. In a follow&#8208;up one&#8208;pot procedure, pyrazolo&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals can easily be accessed employing a nucleophilic cyclocondensation.

         <title>Visible Light and Triselenium Dicyanide (TSD): New Horizons in the Synthesis of Organic Selenocyanates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 59, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ingenious method for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl selenocyanates and &#945;&#8208;hydroxy selenocyanates is to simply react triselenium dicyanide and styrenes (or alkenes) under blue light irradiation and O2. Additionally, &#945;&#8208;carbonyl selenocyanates were explored as a synthetic platform in a multicomponent process to prepare 2&#8208;phenylimidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine derivatives, which were investigated for their photophysical properties.







Abstract
Herein, we describe a new method for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl selenocyanates by reacting triselenium dicyanide (TSD) and styrenes under blue light irradiation and O2 atmosphere. The reactions are triggered by the formation of Se&#8208;centered radical species, followed by the addition/oxidation of the styrene &#960;&#8208;bond. &#945;&#8208;Carbonyl selenocyanates and &#945;&#8208;hydroxy selenocyanates were obtained in moderate to excellent yields from aryl&#8208; and alkyl&#8208;substituted alkenes, respectively. It was demonstrated that &#945;&#8208;carbonyl selenocyanates could be used as a synthetic platform in a multicomponent reaction strategy to prepare 2&#8208;phenylimidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine derivatives, which were evaluated for their photophysical properties. Overall, this new method provides a useful tool for synthesizing &#945;&#8208;carbonyl selenocyanates, and demonstrates their potential for use in the synthesis of other compounds, thus giving new synthetic opportunities to construct organic selenocyanate compounds.

         <title>Post&#8208;Installation of Fused Benzoheptagons at the Periphery of NiII Porphyrins: Helical Structures and Conformation&#8208;Adjustable Fullerenes Binding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 59, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porphyrin dimer containing two seven&#8208;membered rings in the bridging moiety was made! Fused&#8208;benzoheptagon&#8208;installed NiII porphyrins were synthesized by a newly developed protocol. The porphyrin dimer is in a helix state in solution on its own, but when a fullerene comes along, it curls up and catches the fullerene. The seven&#8208;membered ring at the bridging site serves to provide flexibility to the porphyrin dimer.@naist_aratani @NAIST_MS_JP







Abstract
Fused&#8208;benzoheptagon&#8208;installed NiII porphyrins were synthesized by a protocol consisting of (2&#8208;formyl)arylation at the meso&#8208;position(s) of NiII porphyrins, conversion of formyl group to methoxyethene group by Wittig reaction, and final Bi(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed cyclization. The structures of these porphyrins have been revealed by X&#8208;ray analysis. Owing to the installed heptagon ring(s), these porphyrins show curved structures with conformational flexibility. Dimer has been shown to have a small activation barrier for inversion and to capture C60 and C70 with large association constants with adjustable conformational changes.

Dimer has been shown to have a small activation barrier for inversion and to capture C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;70&lt;/sub&gt; with large association constants with adjustable conformational changes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nucleophile&#8208;Triggered &#960;&#8208;Topological Transformation: A New Synthetic Approach to Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Emissive Rhodamines</title>

&#960;&#8208;Topological transformation&#8208;based synthetic method: A new type of near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;emissive rhodamine dye, called Polymethine&#8208;embedded Rhodamine Fluorophore (PeR Fluor), has been developed. Linear fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated PeR Fluor is prepared in one step by mixing different nucleophiles (Nu&#8722;) with ABPXs, a family of rhodamines with a cross&#8208;conjugated structure. PeR Fluor exhibits bright NIR fluorescence emission and high photostability.







Abstract
We describe a &#960;&#8208;topological transformation&#8208;based synthetic method for the preparation of a new type of near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;emissive rhodamine dye called Polymethine&#8208;embedded Rhodamine Fluorophore (PeR Fluor). In contrast to conventional NIR&#8208;emissive dyes that require tedious synthetic steps and/or a high cost, linear fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated PeR Fluor can be regioselectively prepared in one step by mixing different nucleophiles with ABPXs, a family of rhodamines with a cross&#8208;conjugated structure. PeR Fluor exhibits bright NIR fluorescence emission and high photostability owing to the cooperative &#960;&#8208;electron system of rhodamines and polymethine scaffolds. Large bathochromic shifts of the absorption and fluorescence emission maxima can be achieved by modifying the N&#8208;substituted group to obtain NIR&#8208;absorbing/emitting PeR Fluor. We also demonstrate the stimulus&#8208;responsive functionality of PeR Fluor through the addition of chemicals (acid/base), which shows switchable NIR and visible fluorescence response. Our &#960;&#8208;topological transformation&#8208;based synthetic method is a promising approach to produce new functionalized rhodamine dyes.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Activation of Carbon&#8211;Carbon Bonds in Hydroxymethylfurfural Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 59, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The palladium&#8208;catalyzed activation of carbon&#8208;carbon bonds in derivatives of hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) has been developed for the arylation with iodobenzenes. Mechanistic studies suggest a decarboxylative mechanism. This strategy offers an efficient and sustainable approach for the synthesis of arylfuran derivatives.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed activation of C&#8722;C bonds in organic molecules is a powerful tool for the synthesis of value&#8208;added compounds. 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) derivatives are a promising class of biomass&#8208;derived chemicals that have received considerable attention due to their potential applications in the synthesis of biologically active molecules and materials. However, the selective activation of unstrained C&#8722;C bonds is a challenging task, mainly due to their relatively high bond dissociation energies. Herein, we report a palladium&#8208;catalyzed method for the efficient C&#8722;C bond activation of HMF derivatives, enabling their arylation with iodobenzenes. Mechanistic studies, including reaction&#8208;profile analysis, competition experiments and head&#8208;space IR spectroscopy suggest a decarboxylative mechanism.

         <title>Platinum(IV)&#8211;Gold(I) Agents with Promising Anticancer Activity: Selected Studies in 2D and 3D Triple&#8208;Negative Breast Cancer Models</title>

Two are better than one, heterometallic anticancer agents continue to impress: A Platinum(IV)&#8211;gold(I) agent inhibits several TNBC cancer hallmarks with no decreased drug sensitivity in 3D spheroids versus 2D cell culture models, inhibiting thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) in cells at concentrations five times lower than the IC50 value.







Abstract
New heterometallic binuclear and trinuclear platinum(IV)&#8211;gold(I) compounds of the type [Pt(L)nCl2(OH){(OOC&#8208;4&#8208;C6H4&#8208;PPh2)AuCl}x] (L=NH3, n=2; x=1, 2; L=diaminocyclohexane, DACH, n=1; x=2) are described. These compounds are cytotoxic and selective against a small panel of renal, bladder, ovarian, and breast cancer cell lines. We selected a trinuclear PtAu2 compound containing the PtIV core based on oxaliplatin, to further investigate its cell&#8208;death pathway, cell and organelle uptake and anticancer effects against the triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231&#8197;cell line. This compound induces apoptosis and accumulates mainly in the nucleus and mitochondria. It also exerts remarkable antimigratory and antiangiogenic properties, and has a potent cytotoxic effect against TNBC 3D spheroids. Trinuclear compounds do not seem to display relevant interactions with calf thymus (CT) DNA and plasmid (pBR322) even in the presence of reducing agents, but inhibit pro&#8208;angiogenic enzyme thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) in TNBC cells.

         <title>Photocaging of Carboxylic Function Bearing Biomolecules by New Thiazole Derived Fluorophore</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 59, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report on synthesis of a new bright blue&#8208;green fluorophore for targeted delivery of biologically active substances containing a carboxyl group. The resulting hybrids were thoroughly studied to understand their photophysical properties and behavior under various conditions. The mechanism of photorelease of caging molecules were studied. Biological experiments demonstrated their bioavailability and easy penetration into living cells.







Abstract
The design and synthesis of a new fluorophore containing an arylidene thiazole scaffold resulted in a compound with good photophysical characteristics. Furthermore, the thiazole C5&#8208;methyl group was easily modified into specific functional groups (CH2Br and CH2OH) for the formation of a series of photocourier molecules containing model compounds (benzoic acids), as well as prodrugs, including salicylic acid, caffeic acid, and chlorambucil via a &#8220;benzyl&#8221; linker. Spectral characteristics (1H, 13C NMR, and high&#8208;resolution mass spectra) corresponded to the proposed structures. The photocourier molecules demonstrated absorption with high values of coefficient of molar extinction, exhibited contrasting green emission, and showed good dark stability. The mechanism of the photorelease was investigated through spectral analysis, HPLC&#8208;HRMS, and supported by TD&#8208;DFT calculations. The photoheterolysis and elimination of carboxylic acids were proved to occur in the excited state, yielding a carbocation as an intermediate moiety. The fluorophore structure provided stability to the carbocation through the delocalization of the positive charge via resonance structures. Viability assessment of Vero cells using the MTT&#8208;test confirmed the weak cytotoxicity of prodrugs without irradiation and it increase upon UV&#8208;light.

A saddle&#8208;shaped macrocyclic host: An expanded porphyrinoid macrocycle with a saddle&#8208;shaped structure was synthesized. It is suitable for host&#8211;guest complexation by &#960;&#8208; &#960; interactions with four equivalents of fullerene C60 in all three directions. UV/vis/NIR transient absorption spectroscopy exhibits a strong long&#8208;lived NIR absorption reminiscent of that of porphyrins but shows no porphyrin&#8208;type Q&#8208;band.







Abstract
We present the synthesis of a new type of an expanded porphyrinoid macrocycle with a saddle&#8208;shaped morphology and its complexation of C60 guest molecules. The new macrocycle contains four carbazole and four triazole moieties and can be readily synthesized via a copper&#8208;catalyzed click reaction. It shows specific photo&#8208;physical properties including fluorescence with a high quantum yield of 60&#8201;%. The combination of the saddle&#8208;shaped geometry with the expanded &#960;&#8208;system allows for host&#8211;guest interactions with C60 in a stacked polymer fashion. Evidence for the presence of a host&#8211;guest complex is provided both in solution by NMR spectroscopy and in the solid state by X&#8208;ray structure analysis.

         <title>Tunable Fluorescence and Morphology of Aggregates Built from a Mechanically Bonded Amphiphilic Bistable [2]Rotaxane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 59, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel mechanically bonded amphiphile (MBA)&#8208;bistable [2]rotaxane H2 was designed and prepared. In both the solution and aggregated states, H2 demonstrated pH&#8208;responsive emissions due to the presence of a distance&#8208;dependent photoinduced electron transfer (PET) process. Moreover, the morphology of H2 aggregates can be tuned from nanospheres to vesicles due to the pH&#8208;controlled shuttling motion&#8208;induced alternation of H2 amphiphilicity.







Abstract
Advanced Organic Chemical Materials Co&#8208;constructed Mechanically bonded amphiphiles (MBAs), also known as mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs), have emerged as an important kind of functional building block for the construction of artificial molecular machines and soft materials. Herein, a novel MBA, i.&#8201;e., bistable [2]rotaxane H2 was designed and synthesized. In the solution state, H2 demonstrated pH and metal ion&#8208;responsive emissions due to the presence of a distance&#8208;dependent photoinduced electron transfer (PET) process and the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) process, respectively. Importantly, the amphiphilic feature of H2 has endowed it with unique self&#8208;assembly capability, and nanospheres were obtained in a mixed H2O/CH3CN solvent. Moreover, the morphology of H2 aggregates can be tuned from nanospheres to vesicles due to the pH&#8208;controlled shuttling motion&#8208;induced alternation of H2 amphiphilicity. Interestingly, larger spheres with novel pearl&#8208;chain&#8208;like structures from H2 were observed after adding stoichiometric Zn2+. In particular, H2 shows pH&#8208;responsive emissions in its aggregation state, allowing the visualization of the shuttling movement by just naked eyes. It is assumed that the well&#8208;designed [2]rotaxane, and particularly the proposed concept of MBA shown here, will further enrich the families of MIMs, offering prospects for synthesizing more MIMs with novel assembly capabilities and bottom&#8208;up building dynamic smart materials with unprecedented functions.

         <title>Determination of the Handedness of Urea Inclusion Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 59, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To establish the correlation between the optical rotation and the absolute structure of urea inclusion compounds (UICs), three pairs of enantiomorphic UICs were studied. This successful experimental elucidation of the handedness of UICs not only settled a question that has lasted half a century, but also showcased the feasibility of absolute structure determination by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD).







Abstract
Since the discovery of urea inclusion compounds (UICs) in 1940, the handedness of this chiral helical system has not been established experimentally. Here three UIC systems containing only light atoms were studied. The optical rotations were first measured, and the absolute structures of the enantiomorphic domains of three UICs were determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD). The correlation between the optical rotation and the absolute configuration of the UICs was finally established, showcasing the power of absolute structure determination by SCXRD, which is essential in structural chemistry and pharmaceutical research.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of Enantioenriched Tertiary and Quaternary &#945;&#8208;Chiral Allylsilanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 59, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioenriched tertiary and quaternary &#945;&#8208;chiral allylsilanes have been obtained by metal&#8208;free asymmetric allylic alkylation of &#947;&#8208;substituted primary allylic bromides with primary alkyl Grignard reagents activated by a chiral Alexakis&#8208;type NHC ligand.







Abstract
Access to enantioenriched tertiary and quaternary &#945;&#8208;chiral allysilanes without any transition&#8208;metal catalyst is reported. This was achieved by enantioselective allylic displacement of &#947;&#8208;silylated allylic bromides through Lewis base activation of Grignard reagents by a bidentate chiral NHC ligand. The process afforded both high &#947;&#8208;regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity and is compatible with a wide range of silyl groups on the substrates.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Selective &#945;&#8208;Alkylation of &#946;&#8208;Naphthols using Primary Alcohols: Elucidating the Influence of Base and Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 59, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed site selective &#945;&#8208;alkylation of &#946;&#8208;naphthols using both arylmethanols and aliphatic alcohols as alkylating agents is reported in which water is the only byproduct. Mechanistic investigations indicate that the reactions proceed via aldehyde intermediates. DFT studies revealed that the base and in&#8197;situ generated water play important roles in catalysis.







Abstract
Functionalized arenes and arenols have diverse applications in chemical synthesis and material chemistry. Selective functionalization of arenols is a topic of prime interest. In particular, direct alkylation of arenols using alcohols is a challenging task. In this report, a ruthenium pincer catalyzed direct &#945;&#8208;alkylation of &#946;&#8208;naphthol using primary alcohols as alkylating reagents is reported. Notably, aryl and heteroaryl methanols and linear and branched aliphatic alcohols underwent selective alkylation reactions, in which water is the only byproduct. Notably, catalytically derived &#945;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;naphthol products displayed high absorbance, emissive properties, and quantum yields (up to 93.2&#8201;%). Dearomative bromination on &#945;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;naphthol is demonstrated as a synthetic application. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction involves an aldehyde intermediate. DFT studies support this finding and further reveal that a stoichiometric amount of base is required to make the aldol condensation as well as elementary steps required for regeneration of catalytically active species. In situ&#8208;generated water molecule from the aldol condensation reaction plays an important role in the regeneration of an active catalyst.

Notably, catalytically derived &#945;-alkyl-&#946;-naphthol products displayed high absorbance, emissive properties, and quantum yields (up to 93.2&#8201;%). Dearomative bromination on &#945;-alkyl-&#946;-naphthol is demonstrated as a synthetic application. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction involves an aldehyde intermediate. DFT studies support this finding and further reveal that a stoichiometric amount of base is required to make the aldol condensation as well as elementary steps required for regeneration of catalytically active species. In situ-generated water molecule from the aldol condensation reaction plays an important role in the regeneration of an active catalyst.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Phosphinidene conducts an auction for the best P=X bond: Cyclic phosphinoamidinate&#8208;supported phosphinidene (NP)P is a natural precursor to base&#8208;stabilized PIII compounds (NP)P=X (X=O, NR, S). Interestingly, for the stronger P=O and P=N bonds, the respective compounds (NP)P=O and (NP)P=NTol are labile and cannot be isolated, but can be intercepted by isocyanate TolNCO to give the urea compound (NP)P&#8208;(NTol)2CO. In contrast, the sulfide (NP)P=S, prepared by a reaction of (NP)P with sulfur, is isolable. More information can be found in the Research Article by S.&#8197;F. Vyboishchikov, G.&#8197;I. Nikonov and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301842).

         <title>Dearomatization of C6 Aromatic Hydrocarbons by Main Group Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 59, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dearomatization of C6 aromatic hydrocarbons by low&#8208;valent main group compounds represent an attractive gateway toward their functionalization for stoichiometric transformations and catalytic applications. This review is aimed to cover the different pathways in C6 aromatic hydrocarbon activation that have been achieved in the past few decades.







Abstract
The dearomatization reaction is a powerful method for transformation of simple aromatic compounds to unique chemical architectures rapidly in synthetic chemistry. Over the past decades, the chemistry in this field has evolved significantly and various important organic compounds such as crucial bioactive molecules have been synthesized through dearomatization. In general, photochemical conditions or assistance by transition metals are required for dearomatization of rigid arenes. Recently, main&#8208;group elements, especially naturally abundant elements in the Earth's crust, have attracted attention as they have low toxicity and are cost&#8208;effective compared to the late transition metals. In recent decades, a variety of low&#8208;valent main&#8208;group molecules, which enable the activation of stable aromatic compounds under mild conditions, have been developed. This minireview highlights the developments in the chemistry of dearomatization of C6 aromatic hydrocarbons by main&#8208;group compounds leading to the formation of seven&#8208;membered EC6 (E=main&#8208;group elements) ring or cycloaddition products.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dearomatization of C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; aromatic hydrocarbons&lt;/b&gt; by low-valent main group compounds represent an attractive gateway toward their functionalization for stoichiometric transformations and catalytic applications. This review is aimed to cover the different pathways in C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; aromatic hydrocarbon activation that have been achieved in the past few decades.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dearomatization reaction is a powerful method for transformation of simple aromatic compounds to unique chemical architectures rapidly in synthetic chemistry. Over the past decades, the chemistry in this field has evolved significantly and various important organic compounds such as crucial bioactive molecules have been synthesized through dearomatization. In general, photochemical conditions or assistance by transition metals are required for dearomatization of rigid arenes. Recently, main-group elements, especially naturally abundant elements in the Earth's crust, have attracted attention as they have low toxicity and are cost-effective compared to the late transition metals. In recent decades, a variety of low-valent main-group molecules, which enable the activation of stable aromatic compounds under mild conditions, have been developed. This minireview highlights the developments in the chemistry of dearomatization of C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; aromatic hydrocarbons by main-group compounds leading to the formation of seven-membered EC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (E=main-group elements) ring or cycloaddition products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Indacenopicene&#8208;based Buckybowl Catcher for Recognition of Fullerenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel type of buckycatcher based on two bowl&#8208;shaped bromoindacenopicene moieties was synthesized and characterized by NMR and mass spectrometry. DFT calculations show a shape fit of the catcher cavity for fullerene binding. Interactions were confirmed for C60 and C70 utilizing NMR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC).







Abstract
A novel buckybowl catcher with an extended &#960;&#8208;surface has been synthesized via cross&#8208;coupling of two bowl shaped bromoindacenopicene moieties with a tolyl linker. The obtained catcher has been unambiguously characterized by 2D&#8208;NMR and mass spectrometry. DFT calculations indicate that the curved shape of the receptor moieties is favourable for binding fullerenes. Effective binding was confirmed for interactions with C60 and C70 utilizing NMR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The resulting binding values show a higher affinity of the catcher towards C70 over C60. The designed catcher demonstrated the fundamental possibility of creating sensors for spherical aromaticity.

         <title>Vanadium(V) Pyridine&#8208;Containing Schiff Base Catecholate Complexes are Lipophilic, Redox&#8208;Active and Selectively Cytotoxic in Glioblastoma (T98G) Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vanadium(V) catecholates are promising agents for intratumoral injections to treat glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer. We report a novel promising analog abbreviated [VO(SALIEP)(DTB)] that is highly selective towards glioblastoma cells and nontoxic to normal cells due to the presence of the pyridine ring on the Schiff base. This is the first structure&#8208;activity study to establish this scaffold, which allows high toxicity against glioblastoma (T98G) cells.







Abstract
Two new series of complexes with pyridine&#8208;containing Schiff bases, [VVO(SALIEP)L] and [VVO(Cl&#8208;SALIEP)L] (SALIEP=N&#8208;(salicylideneaminato)&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethylpyridine; Cl&#8208;SALIEP=N&#8208;(5&#8208;chlorosalicylideneaminato)&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethyl)pyridine, L=catecholato(2&#8722;) ligand) have been synthesized. Characterization by 1H and 51V&#8197;NMR and UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopies confirmed that: 1)&#8197;most complexes form two major geometric isomers in solution, and [VVO(SALIEP)(DTB)] (DTB=3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcatecholato(2&#8722;)) forms two isomers that equilibrate in solution; and 2)&#8197;tert&#8208;butyl substituents were necessary to stabilize the reduced VIV species (EPR spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry). The pyridine moiety within the Schiff base ligands significantly changed their chemical properties with unsubstituted catecholate ligands compared with the parent HSHED (N&#8208;(salicylideneaminato)&#8208;N&#8242;&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)&#8208;1,2&#8208;ethanediamine) Schiff base complexes. Immediate reduction to VIV occurred for the unsubstituted&#8208;catecholato VV complexes on dissolution in DMSO. By contrast, the pyridine moiety within the Schiff base significantly improved the hydrolytic stability of [VVO(SALIEP)(DTB)] compared with [VVO(HSHED)(DTB)]. [VVO(SALIEP)(DTB)] had moderate stability in cell culture media. There was significant cellular uptake of the intact complex by T98G (human glioblastoma) cells and very good anti&#8208;proliferative activity (IC50 6.7&#177;0.9&#8197;&#956;M, 72&#8197;h), which was approximately five times higher than for the non&#8208;cancerous human cell line, HFF&#8208;1 (IC50 34&#177;10&#8197;&#956;M). This made [VVO(SALIEP)(DTB)] a potential drug candidate for the treatment of advanced gliomas by intracranial injection.

Characterization by &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H and &lt;sup&gt;51&lt;/sup&gt;V&#8197;NMR and UV-Vis spectroscopies confirmed that: 1)&#8197;most complexes form two major geometric isomers in solution, and [V&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;O(SALIEP)(DTB)] (DTB=3,5-di-&lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butylcatecholato(2&#8722;)) forms two isomers that equilibrate in solution; and 2)&#8197;&lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyl substituents were necessary to stabilize the reduced V&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; species (EPR spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry). The pyridine moiety within the Schiff base ligands significantly changed their chemical properties with unsubstituted catecholate ligands compared with the parent HSHED (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-(salicylideneaminato)-&lt;i&gt;N&#8242;&lt;/i&gt;-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1,2-ethanediamine) Schiff base complexes. Immediate reduction to V&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; occurred for the unsubstituted-catecholato V&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt; complexes on dissolution in DMSO. By contrast, the pyridine moiety within the Schiff base significantly improved the hydrolytic stability of [V&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;O(SALIEP)(DTB)] compared with [V&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;O(HSHED)(DTB)]. [V&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;O(SALIEP)(DTB)] had moderate stability in cell culture media. There was significant cellular uptake of the intact complex by T98G (human glioblastoma) cells and very good anti-proliferative activity (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; 6.7&#177;0.9&#8197;&#956;M, 72&#8197;h), which was approximately five times higher than for the non-cancerous human cell line, HFF-1 (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; 34&#177;10&#8197;&#956;M). This made [V&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;O(SALIEP)(DTB)] a potential drug candidate for the treatment of advanced gliomas by intracranial injection.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A two&#8208;level molecular stack composed of a point&#8208;chiral element (&#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin) and an axially chiral element (biphenyl) is shown. Operators are setting the key noncovalent interactions (hydrogen bonds) that allow efficient and persistent stereocommunication between the two levels. This approach enables fine tuning of chiroptical properties of the cage&#8208;like molecule with stimuli such as solvent and temperature. More information can be found in the Research Article by D.

         <title>Synthesis of Partially Fluorinated Alkyl Triflates by Electrochemical Fluorination (Simons Process)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical fluorination (ECF, Simons process) has been adopted for the preparation of partially fluorinated methyl and ethyl triflates, which are established reagents in organofluorine chemistry. The ECF process is easily scalable and only requires readily available starting compounds and electricity. Thus, it is fun to use this sustainable method for the synthesis of valuable chemicals, as highlighted by the cover picture showing molecules in Simons Fluorination Fun Park. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Finze and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302701). The cover picture was designed by Thomas Neubert.

         <title>Porphyrin&#8208;based Bi&#8208;MOFs with Enriched Surface Bi Active Sites for Boosting Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porphyrin&#8208;based Bi&#8208;MOF with enriched surface Bi active sites were obtained by modulating the crystal facet ingeniously. The knitting of Bi active sites onto the porphyrin ligands with the exposure of rich Bi sites can not only ameliorate the light absorption, but also stabilize the catalytic active sites and promote efficient ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer, for significantly ameliorating the performance of photo&#8208;reduction of CO2 to CO and CH4.







Abstract
The inherent challenges in using metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) for photocatalytic CO2 reduction are the combination of wide&#8208;range light harvesting, efficient charge separation and transfer as well as highly exposed catalytic active sites for CO2 activation and reduction. We present here a promising solution to satisfy these requirements together by modulating the crystal facet and surface atomic structure of a porphyrin&#8208;based bismuth&#8208;MOF (Bi&#8208;PMOF). The series of structural and photo&#8208;electronic characterizations together with photocatalytic CO2 reduction experiment collectively establish that the enriched Bi active sites on the (010) surface prefer to promote efficient charge separation and transfer as well as the activation and reduction of CO2. Specifically, the Bi&#8208;PMOFs&#8208;120&#8208;F with enriched surface Bi active sites exhibits optimal photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance to CO (28.61&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1g&#8722;1) and CH4 (8.81&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1g&#8722;1). This work provides new insights to synthesize highly efficient main group p&#8208;block metal Bi&#8208;MOF photocatalysts for CO2 reduction through a facet&#8208;regulation strategy and sheds light on the surface structure&#8208;activity relationships of the MOFs.

         <title>Dense NiCo2O4 Nanoneedles Grown on Carbon Foam Showing Excellent Electrochemical and Microwave Absorption Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NiCo2O4/CF maintains the flexibility of the carbon foam framework during a simple hydrothermal and annealing process. Applying foam carbon as a standalone electrode overcomes the limitation of low specific capacitance. It addresses the significant challenge of NiCo2O4 nanoparticle aggregation, achieving suitable specific capacitance and efficient microwave absorption performance.







Abstract
Electromagnetic pollution could harm sensitive electronic equipment due to the rising use of electronic devices and communication infrastructure. The supercapacitor&#8216;s electrochemical performance should be enhanced, and electromagnetic damage should be prevented. This study proposes NiCo2O4/CF composites for supercapacitors and microwave absorption. They are made by combining hydrothermal and annealing processes. Dense NiCo2O4 nanoneedles were uniformly grown on the outer layer of carbon foam (CF) as a growth skeleton, preventing the agglomeration of NiCo2O4. The composite had a specific capacitance of 537.5&#8197;F/g at 1&#8197;A/g. When the current density was set to 1&#8197;A/g, the supercapacitor that used NiCo2O4/CF as the cathode had a specific capacitance of 70.7&#8197;F/g, and when the current density was increased to 10&#8197;A/g, the original specific capacitance of 87.2&#8201;% could still be maintained after 5000 charge&#8208;discharge cycles. At a power density of 3695.5&#8197;W/kg, an energy density of 22.1&#8197;Wh/kg could be maintained. Furthermore, we performed a microwave absorption test and determined its reflection loss curve for various sample thicknesses. Recombination enhanced the composite material&#8216;s microwave absorption capability by greatly reducing the dielectric loss and the magnetic loss.

Abstract
Designing unique nanomaterials for the selective sensing of biomolecules is of significant interest in the field of nanobiotechnology. In this work, we demonstrated the synthesis of ordered Cu nanoparticle&#8208;functionalised mesoporous C3N5 that has unique peroxidase&#8208;like nanozymatic activity for the ultrasensitive and selective detection of glucose and glutathione. A nano hard&#8208;templating technique together with the in&#8208;situ polymerisation and self&#8208;assembly of Cu and high N&#8208;containing CN precursor was adopted to introduce mesoporosity as well as high N and Cu content in mesoporous C3N5. Due to the ordered structure and highly dispersed Cu in the mesoporous C3N5, a large enhancement of the peroxidase mimetic activity in the oxidation of a redox dye in the presence of hydrogen peroxide could be obtained. Additionally, the optimised Cu&#8208;functionalised mesoporous C3N5 exhibited excellent sensitivity to glutathione with a low detection limit of 2.0&#8197;ppm. The strong peroxidase activity of the Cu&#8208;functionalised mesoporous C3N5 was also effectively used for the sensing of glucose with a detection limit of 0.4&#8197;mM through glucose oxidation with glucose oxidase. This unique Cu&#8208;functionalised mesoporous C3N5 has the potential for detecting various molecules in the environment as well as for next&#8208;generation glucose and glutathione diagnostic devices.

         <title>Solvent Acts as the Referee in a Match&#8208;Up Between Charged and Preorganized Receptors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvent dependent binding: Herein, a cationic receptor was employed to quantify chloride binding in solvents of differing polarity and draw comparison to a neutral, preorganized macrocycle. As expected, ion&#8208;ion attraction leads to stronger binding but only in low&#8208;polarity dichloromethane. Unexpectedly, the neutral receptor wins the competition for binding in polar solvents due to being preorganized.







Abstract
The prevalence of anion&#8208;cation contacts in biomolecular recognition under aqueous conditions suggests that ionic interactions should dominate the binding of anions in solvents across both high and low polarities. Investigations of this idea using titrations in low polarity solvents are impaired by interferences from ion pairing that prevent a clear picture of binding. To address this limitation and test the impact of ion&#8208;ion interactions across multiple solvents, we quantified chloride binding to a cationic receptor after accounting for ion pairing. In these studies, we created a chelate receptor using aryl&#8208;triazole CH donors and a quinolinium unit that directs its cationic methyl inside the binding pocket. In low&#8208;polarity dichloromethane, the 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex (log K1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ~ 7.3) is more stable than neutral chelates, but fortuitously comparable to a preorganized macrocycle (log K1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ~ 6.9). Polar acetonitrile and DMSO diminish stabilities of the charged receptor (log K1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ~ 3.7 and 1.9) but surprisingly 100&#8208;fold more than the macrocycle. While both receptors lose stability by dielectric screening of electrostatic stability, the cationic receptor also pays additional costs of organization. Thus even though the charged receptor has stronger binding in apolar solvents, the uncharged receptor has more anion affinity in polar solvents.

         <title>Structure and Flexibility of Copper&#8208;Modified DNA G&#8208;Quadruplexes Investigated by 19F ENDOR Experiments at 34&#8197;GHz

19F ENDOR&#8208;based distance measurements at 34&#8197;GHz report on the structure and flexibility of DNA G&#8208;quadruplexes. Our findings show that measuring precise distances at 34&#8197;GHz is feasible without the loss of sensitivity and resolution.







Abstract
DNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (GQs) are of great interest due to their involvement in crucial biological processes such as telomerase maintenance and gene expression. Furthermore, they are reported as catalytically active DNAzymes and building blocks in bio&#8208;nanotechnology. GQs exhibit remarkable structural diversity and conformational heterogeneity, necessitating precise and reliable tools to unravel their structure&#8208;function relationships. Here, we present insights into the structure and conformational flexibility of a unimolecular GQ with high spatial resolution via electron&#8208;nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) experiments combined with Cu(II) and fluorine labeling. These findings showcase the successful application of the 19F&#8208;ENDOR methodology at 34&#8197;GHz, overcoming the limitations posed by the complexity and scarcity of higher&#8208;frequency spectrometers. Importantly, our approach retains both sensitivity and orientational resolution. This integrated study not only enhances our understanding of GQs but also expands the methodological toolbox for studying other macromolecules.

         <title>Bioinspired Hydrophobicity for Enhancing Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The local CO2 concentration matters for electrochemical CO2 reduction in terms of the activity and selectivity. This review summarizes the bioinspired hydrophobicity design of catalysts and other strategies including catalysts modification, electrolytes selection, and electrolyzers engineering for CO2 enrichment to realize enhanced CO2R performance. This review is expected to provide a guidance for the development of practical electrocatalytic CO2R systems.







Abstract
Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction (CO2R) is a promising pathway for converting greenhouse gasses into valuable fuels and chemicals using intermittent renewable energy. Enormous efforts have been invested in developing and designing CO2R electrocatalysts suitable for industrial applications at accelerated reaction rates. The microenvironment, specifically the local CO2 concentration (local [CO2]) as well as the water and ion transport at the CO2&#8211;electrolyte&#8211;catalyst interface, also significantly impacts the current density, Faradaic efficiency (FE), and operation stability. In nature, hydrophobic surfaces of aquatic arachnids trap appreciable amounts of gases due to the &#8220;plastron effect&#8221;, which could inspire the reliable design of CO2R catalysts and devices to enrich gaseous CO2. In this review, starting from the wettability modulation, we summarize CO2 enrichment strategies to enhance CO2R. To begin, superwettability systems in nature and their inspiration for concentrating CO2 in CO2R are described and discussed. Moreover, other CO2 enrichment strategies, compatible with the hydrophobicity modulation, are explored from the perspectives of catalysts, electrolytes, and electrolyzers, respectively. Finally, a perspective on the future development of CO2 enrichment strategies is provided. We envision that this review could provide new guidance for further developments of CO2R toward practical applications.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Tunable 1,2&#8208;Difunctionalization of Terminal Alkynes: Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Ketones</title>

A new method efficiently adds C&#8722;C and C&#8722;S bonds to terminal alkynes, allowing for accessing a range of &#946;&#8208;substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. The versatility of the approach lies in its ability to tune the reaction conditions to target different positions of the alkyne by switching temperature.







Abstract
A metal&#8208;free tunable 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of the terminal alkynes showcasing a tandem installation of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;S bonds has been developed. The key enabling factor for the approach is the use of acetic acid as an acyl source to synthesize &#946;&#8208;substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. The reaction at room temperature leads to the regioselective acylation at the terminal carbon of alkynes, whereas at &#8722;78&#8201;&#176;C, the acylation occurs at the more substituted carbon.

         <title>Enantioselective Dearomative [4+2] Cycloaddition Reaction of 1&#8208;Naphthols with In&#8208;Situ Generated ortho&#8208;Quinone Methides</title>

         <dc:description>
The direct dearomatization of non&#8208;functionalized 1&#8208;naphthols was achieved through a chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalyzed enantioselective dearomative [4+2] cycloaddition reaction with in&#8208;situ generated ortho&#8208;quinone methides (o&#8208;QMs). The reported convergent method allows the use of readily available simple 1&#8208;naphthols without pre&#8208;functionalization, furnishing a variety of naphthopyran derivatives in good yields (up to 96&#8201;%) and moderate to excellent enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee) under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
We disclose a catalytic, enantioselective dearomative reaction of non&#8208;functionalized 1&#8208;naphthols, which poses a synthetic challenge to organic chemists because of the relative ease of rearomatization via the elimination of a proton. In this work, the direct dearomatization of non&#8208;functionalized 1&#8208;naphthols was achieved through a chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalyzed enantioselective dearomative [4+2] cycloaddition reaction with in&#8208;situ generated ortho&#8208;quinone methides (o&#8208;QMs).

The observed regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivities are the keys to the success of the current strategy utilizing o&#8208;QM as a diene surrogates, in combination with CPA catalysis.

         <title>Geometrically Deformed and Conformationally Rigid Phosphorus Trisamides Featuring an Unsymmetrical Backbone</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating a P(III) center in a rigid bicyclic platform offers an attractive way to invoke significant geometric distortion of the phosphorus atom. Current scaffolds are based on a relatively narrow set of ligand platforms. This work focusses on the synthesis as well as versatile oxidation, addition and coordination chemistry of geometrically distorted P(III) species featuring a synthetically modular, nonsymmetric trisamine platform.







Abstract
Nonclassical P(III) centers have attracted much attention in recent years. Incorporating a P(III) center in a rigid bicyclic platform offers a particularly attractive way to invoke significant geometric distortion of the phosphorus atom that may in turn induce unusual reactivity. Although still relatively scarcely explored, phosphorus centers enforced in a non&#8208;C3 symmetry have gained significant traction lately. However, the current scaffolds are based on a relatively limited set of design principles and ligand platforms associated therewith. This work is focussed on the synthesis as well as versatile oxidation, addition and coordination chemistry of a geometrically distorted P(III) species featuring a synthetically modular, nonsymmetric trisamine platform derived from 2&#8208;(methylamino)&#8208;N&#8208;(2&#8208;(methylamino)phenyl)benzenesulfonamide.

         <title>Symmetrical and Mixed Tris(acyl)phosphines: Synthesis, Oxidation and Photochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Symmetrical and mixed tris(acyl)phosphines: In this contribution, we present a convenient synthetic procedure starting from red phosphorus to tris(acyl)phosphines (TAPs) and moreover to tris(acyl)phosphine oxides (TAPOs). Several of the synthesized TAPs exhibit a phosphine&#8208;phophaalkene equilibrium, which was studied in detail. The oxidation of some selected TAPs yielded the corresponding TAPOs, which were tested as potential photoinitiators for application.







Abstract
Herein, we present a convenient synthesis for symmetrical and mixed substituted tris(acyl)phosphines (TAPs) starting from red phosphorus. All TAPs exhibit a phosphaalkene&#8208;acylphosphine equilibrium, which was investigated in detail by variable&#8208;temperature (VT) NMR spectroscopy supported by density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations. Depending on the substituents, two phosphaalkene derivatives and ten acylphosphine derivatives could be isolated. NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography enabled a clear structural assignment of these compounds. Oxidation of selected TAPs led to the formation of the corresponding tris(acyl)phosphine oxides (TAPOs). Furthermore, their spectroscopic properties as well as their photochemistry was investigated. Especially, the TAPO compounds were evaluated for their suitability as photoinitiators by CIDNP spectroscopy, photobleaching measurements and by storage stability tests.

         <title>Alcohol&#8208;Induced Conformation Changes and Thermodynamic Signatures in the Binding of Polyphenols to Proline&#8208;Rich Salivary Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first contact of tannins, such as ellagic acid, with the human body occurs in the mouth, where they are known to interact with proline&#8208;rich proteins, leading to the development of astringency. Upon addition of &#8764;10&#8197;vol.% EtOH, as present in wines, significant differences in binding strength and stoichiometry were observed, which, dependent on the binding motif, lead to differences in the thermodynamic signatures of the binding process.







Abstract
The first contact of polyphenols (tannins) with the human body occurs in the mouth, where they are known to interact with proline&#8208;rich proteins (PRPs). These interactions are important at a sensory level, especially for the development of astringency, but affect also various other biochemical processes. Employing thermodynamic measurements, fluorescence and CD spectroscopy, we investigated the binding process of the prototypical polyphenol ellagic acid (EA) to different IB&#8208;PRPs and BSA, also in the presence of ethanol, which is known to influence tannin&#8211;protein interactions. Binding of EA to BSA and the small peptide IB7&#8208;14 is weak, but very strong to IB9&#8208;37. The differences in binding strength and stoichiometry are due to differences in the binding motifs, which also lead to differences in the thermodynamic signatures of the binding process. EA binding to BSA is enthalpy&#8208;driven, whereas binding to both IB7&#8208;14 and IB9&#8208;37 is entropy&#8208;driven. The presence of 10&#8197;vol.% EtOH, as present in wines, increases the binding constant of EA with BSA and IB7&#8208;14 drastically, but not that with IB9&#8208;37; however, it changes the binding stoichiometry. These differences can be attributed to the effect of EtOH on the conformation dynamics of the proteins and to changes in hydration properties in alcoholic solution.

         <title>Photophysical Properties of Homo&#8208; and Hetero&#8208;Aggregate Assemblies Made of N&#8208;Annulated Perylene Derivatives</title>

Photophysical properties of homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;aggregate: SEM image of homo&#8208;aggregated system (helical&#8208;shaped) of a covalently&#8208;linked dyad made of photoactive N&#8208;annulated perylene dyes and methylviologen electron acceptor units (P&#8208;MV). Hetero&#8208;aggregated systems containing P dye and P&#8208;MV dyad are also formed in appropriate conditions and the light absorbed by P contributes to photoinduced charge separation within the P&#8208;MV components.







Abstract
We report the absorption spectra and photophysical properties of homo and hetero&#8208;aggregate assemblies of a strongly emissive N&#8208;annulated perylene dye (P) and of a dyad made of P and a methyl viologen derivative (P&#8208;MV), in ethanol&#8208;water solutions. In homo&#8208;aggregate assemblies of P, the &#960;&#8208;&#960;* fluorescence of the isolated chromophore is replaced by excimer emission at lower energy, with a lifetime of 900&#8197;ps, due to excimer formation from the initially prepared excitons. In homo&#8208;aggregate assemblies of P&#8208;MV, photoinduced charge separation, with formation of P+&#8208;MV&#8722; species, occurs in 3&#8197;ps with a charge recombination of 20&#8197;ps. In hetero&#8208;aggregate P/P&#8208;MV systems, the light energy absorbed by the P components delocalizes over various P subunits, and when a P&#8208;MV unit is reached, charge separation occurs; however, excimer emission is present for P/P&#8208;MV ratio larger than 3&#8201;:&#8201;1, indicating that delocalized excitons within the hetero&#8208;aggregate systems extend over a limited number of P chromophores.

In homo-aggregate assemblies of &lt;b&gt;P&lt;/b&gt;, the &#960;-&#960;* fluorescence of the isolated chromophore is replaced by excimer emission at lower energy, with a lifetime of 900&#8197;ps, due to excimer formation from the initially prepared excitons. In homo-aggregate assemblies of &lt;b&gt;P-MV&lt;/b&gt;, photoinduced charge separation, with formation of P&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-MV&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; species, occurs in 3&#8197;ps with a charge recombination of 20&#8197;ps. In hetero-aggregate &lt;b&gt;P/P-MV&lt;/b&gt; systems, the light energy absorbed by the &lt;b&gt;P&lt;/b&gt; components delocalizes over various &lt;b&gt;P&lt;/b&gt; subunits, and when a &lt;b&gt;P-MV&lt;/b&gt; unit is reached, charge separation occurs; however, excimer emission is present for &lt;b&gt;P/P-MV&lt;/b&gt; ratio larger than 3&#8201;:&#8201;1, indicating that delocalized excitons within the hetero-aggregate systems extend over a limited number of &lt;b&gt;P&lt;/b&gt; chromophores.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enabling N2 to Ammonia Conversion in Bi2WO6&#8208;Based Materials: A New Avenue in Photocatalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic N2 fixation is an emerging application for ammonia production via sustainable means. N2 gas activation onto the photocatalyst remains a challenge for current researchers. This concept summarizes the latest developments in this field in Bi2WO6&#8208;based photocatalysts for enhancing N2 chemisorption for maximum ammonia production. The final of this concept mentioned the possible problems with false ammonia quantification and how to do rectification.







Abstract
The field of photocatalysis has been evolving since 1972 since Honda and Fujishima's initial push for using light as an energy source to accomplish redox reactions. Since then, many photocatalysts have been studied, semiconductors or otherwise. A new photocatalytic application to convert N2 gas to ammonia (N2 fixation or nitrogen reduction reaction; NRR) has emerged. Many researchers have steered their research in this direction due to developments in the ease of ammonia detection through UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy. This concept will specifically discuss Bi2WO6&#8208;based materials, techniques to enhance their photocatalytic activity (CO2 reduction, H2 production, pollutant removal, etc.), and their current application in photocatalytic NRR. Initially, a brief introduction of Bi2WO6 along with its VB and CB potentials will be compared to various redox potentials. A final topic of interest would be a brief description of photocatalytic nitrogen fixation with additional consideration to Bi2WO6&#8208;based materials in N2 fixation. A major problem with photocatalytic NRR is the false ammonia quantification in Bi&#8208;based materials, which will be discussed in detail and also ways to minimize them.

         <title>Photoisomerization of &#8220;Partially Embedded Dihydropyridazine&#8221; with a Helical Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chirality control of the title compound by photoracemization is depicted, inspired by &#8220;Jack and the Beanstalk&#8221;. The spiraling trees reaching skyward symbolize molecular changes induced by sunlight, specifically photoirradiation. This image vividly portrays the N&#8722;N bond cleavage within the dihydropyridazine (DHP) ring, rotational motions around a C&#8722;C bond, and the subsequent recombination of N&#8722;N bonds. These transformations serve as a visual representation of the concept of T&#8208;type photochromism of new&#8208;type helicene molecules. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. Usui, Y. Kobori, S. Karasawa and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302413).

         <title>Sustainable Photo&#8208; and Electrochemical Transformation of White Phosphorous (P4) into P1 Organo&#8208;Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this Concept, we present an overview of the most recent growth in photo&#8208; and electrochemical synthesis of P1 organo&#8208;compounds from P4 with special emphasis on sustainable features. The key aspects of innovations regarding activation mode and mechanism have been comprehensively analyzed. A preliminary outlook on the possible future direction of development is provided.







Abstract
Elemental white phosphorous (P4) is a crucial feedstock for the entire phosphorus&#8208;derived chemical industry, serving as a common precursor for the ultimate preparation of high&#8208;grade monophosphorus (P1) fine chemicals. However, the corresponding manufacturing processes generally suffer from a deep reliance on hazardous reagents, inputs of immense energy, emissions of toxic pollutants, and the generation of substantial waste, which have negative impacts on the environment. In this context, sustainability and safety concerns provide a consistent impetus for the urgent overall improvement of phosphorus cycles. In this Concept, we present an overview of the most recent growth in photo&#8208; and electrochemical synthesis of P1 organo&#8208;compounds from P4, with special emphasis on sustainable features. The key aspects of innovations regarding activation mode and mechanism have been comprehensively analyzed. A preliminary look at the possible future direction of development is also provided.

         <title>Assembling Molecular Clips To Build &#960;&#8208;Stacks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stacked aromatic rings are important functional motifs in biological systems but are difficult to replicate artificially. To overcome the limitations of weak, non&#8208;directional, and context&#8208;sensitive van der Waals forces, chemists have devised shape&#8208;complementary molecular clips that assemble into vertical stacks with precise spacing, orientation, and sequence of the layers.







Abstract
Nature utilizes an intimate stacking of aromatic motifs to construct functional structures, as demonstrated in protein folding and polynucleotide assembly. However, organized &#960;&#8208;stacks of artificial molecules are difficult to build, primarily due to the weak, non&#8208;directional, and context&#8208;sensitive nature of van der Waals forces. To overcome these challenges, chemists have invented ingenious architectural designs to construct &#960;&#8208;stacked supramolecular assemblies using clip&#8208;like molecules. This Concept article focuses on molecular clips that enable precise spatial control over assembly patterns, beyond the scope of simple host&#8211;guest chemistry. Different design strategies are analyzed and compared that leverage non&#8208;covalent interactions to create multi&#8208;layer &#960;&#8208;stacks. Particular emphasis is placed on the choice of spine units as they play a crucial role in controlling the (i) spacing, (ii) orientation, and (iii) conformational pre&#8208;organization of linked aromatics to achieve long&#8208;range spatial ordering.

         <title>Yet Another Case of Lithium Metal Atoms and Germanium Atoms Sharing Chemistry in the Solid State: Synthesis and Structural Characterization of Ba2LiGe3</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure of Ba2Li1&#8722;xGe3+x, emphasizing the honeycomb&#8208;like [Li1&#8722;xGe3+x] layers with Li and Ge atoms (denoted in blue and gold) in a partially disordered state.







Abstract
Several Ba&#8722;Li&#8722;Ge ternary phases are known and structurally characterized, including the title compound Ba2LiGe3. Its structure is reported to contain [Ge6]10&#8722; anions that exhibit delocalized bonding with a H&#252;ckel&#8208;like aromatic character. The Ge atoms are in the same plane with the Li atoms, and if both types of atoms are considered as covalently bonded, [LiGe3]4&#8722; honeycomb&#8208;like layers will result. The latter are separated by slabs of Ba2+ cations. However, based on the systematic work detailed herein, it is necessary to re&#8208;evaluate the phase as Ba2Li1&#8722;xGe3+x (x&lt;0.05). Although small, the homogeneity range is clearly demonstrated in the gradual change of the unit cell for four independent samples. Subsequent characterization by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction methods shows that the Ba2Li1&#8722;xGe3+x structure, responds to the varied number of valence electrons and the changes are most pronounced for the refined lengths of the Li&#8722;Ge and Ge&#8722;Ge bonds. Indirectly, the changes in the Ge&#8722;Li/Ge distances within layers affect the stacking too, and these changes can be correlated to the variation of the c&#8208;cell parameter. Chemical bonding analysis based on TB&#8208;LMTO&#8208;ASA level calculations affirms the notion for covalent character of the Ge&#8722;Ge bonds; the Ba&#8722;Ge and Li&#8722;Ge interactions also show some degree of covalency.

&lt;/sub&gt;] layers with Li and Ge atoms (denoted in blue and gold) in a partially disordered state.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several Ba&#8722;Li&#8722;Ge ternary phases are known and structurally characterized, including the title compound Ba&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;LiGe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Its structure is reported to contain [Ge&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;10&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions that exhibit delocalized bonding with a H&#252;ckel-like aromatic character. The Ge atoms are in the same plane with the Li atoms, and if both types of atoms are considered as covalently bonded, [LiGe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; honeycomb-like layers will result. The latter are separated by slabs of Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; cations. However, based on the systematic work detailed herein, it is necessary to re-evaluate the phase as Ba&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Li&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;Ge&lt;sub&gt;3+&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). Although small, the homogeneity range is clearly demonstrated in the gradual change of the unit cell for four independent samples. Subsequent characterization by single-crystal X-ray diffraction methods shows that the Ba&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Li&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;Ge&lt;sub&gt;3+&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; structure, responds to the varied number of valence electrons and the changes are most pronounced for the refined lengths of the Li&#8722;Ge and Ge&#8722;Ge bonds. Indirectly, the changes in the Ge&#8722;Li/Ge distances within layers affect the stacking too, and these changes can be correlated to the variation of the &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;-cell parameter. Chemical bonding analysis based on TB-LMTO-ASA level calculations affirms the notion for covalent character of the Ge&#8722;Ge bonds; the Ba&#8722;Ge and Li&#8722;Ge interactions also show some degree of covalency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Abstract: Alkali nitridophosphates AP4N7 and A3P6N11 (A&#160;=&#160;Na, K, Rb, Cs) have been known for decades. However, their Li homologues have remained elusive. In this work, the highly condensed lithium (imido)nitridophosphates LiP4N7 and Li3&#8722;xP6N11&#8722;x(NH)x (x&#160;=&#160;1.66(3)) were synthesized from LiPN2 and P3N5 in the multianvil press at 10&#160;GPa. They constitute the first lithium nitridophosphates with 3D networks exhibiting a degree of condensation larger than 0.5 and high thermal stability. LiP4N7 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group P212121 with a&#160;=&#160;4.5846(6)&#160;&#197;, b&#160;=&#160;8.0094(11)&#160;&#197;, and c&#160;=&#160;13.252(2)&#160;&#197; (Z&#160;=&#160;4). Li3&#8722;xP6N11&#8722;x(NH)x crystallizes in the triclinic space group P &#160;with Z&#160;=&#160;2, a&#160;=&#160;4.6911(11)&#160;&#197;, b&#160;=&#160;7.024(2)&#160;&#197;, c&#160;=&#160;12.736(3)&#160;&#197;, &#945;&#160;=&#160;87.726(11), &#946;&#160;=&#160;80.279(11), and &#947;&#160;=&#160;70.551(12)&#176;.

         <title>Electronic effects in Phosphino&#8208;Iminophosphorane PdII complexes upon varying the N substituent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three series of palladium(II) complexes supported by a phosphine&#8208;iminophosphorane ligand built upon an ortho&#8208;phenylene core were investigated to study the influence of the iminophosphorane N substituent. Cis&#8208;dichloride palladium(II) complexes 1 in which the N atom bears an isopropyl (iPr, 1a), a phenyl (Ph, 1b), a trimethylsilyl (TMS, 1c) group or an H atom (1d) were synthesized in high yield. They were characterized by NMR, IR spectroscopy, HR&#8208;mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, and X&#8208;ray diffraction. A substantial bond length difference between the Pd&#8208;Cl bonds was observed in 1. Complexes 1a&#8208;d were converted into [Pd(LR)Cl(CNtBu)](OTf)] 2a&#8208;d whose isocyanide is located trans to the iminophosphorane. The corresponding dicationic complexes [Pd(LR)(CNtBu)2](OTf)2 3a&#8208;d were also synthesized, however they exhibited lower stability in solution than 2, the isopropyl derivative 3a being the most stable of the series. Molecular modeling was performed to rationalize the regioselectivity of the substitution of the single chloride by isocyanide (from 1 to 2) and to study the electronic distribution in the complexes. In particular differences between the TMS and H containing complexes vs the iPr and Ph ones were found. This suggests that the nature of the N substituent is far from innocent and can help tune the reactivity of iminophosphorane complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>10 &#956;m&#8208;Level TiNb2O7 Secondary Particles for Fast&#8208;Charging Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>TiNb2O7 with Wadsley&#8208;Roth phase delivers double theoretical specific capacity and similar working potential in comparison to spinel Li4Ti5O12, &#160;and thus can enable much higher energy density of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the inter&#8208;particle resistance within the high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading TiNb2O7 electrode would impede the capacity release for practical application, especially under fast&#8208;charging condition. Here, we fabricated 10&#8211;20 &#956;m&#8208;size carbon&#8208;coated TiNb2O7 secondary particle (SP&#8208;TiNb2O7) consisting of initial micro&#8208;scale TiNb2O7 particles (MP&#8208;TiNb2O7). The high crystallinity of active material could enable fast charge diffusion and electrochemical reaction rate within particles, and the small number of stacking layers of SP&#8208;TiNb2O7 could reduce the large inter&#8208;particle resistance that regular particle electrode often possesses and achieve high compaction density of electrodes with high mass loading. The investigation on materials structure and electrochemical reaction kinetics verified the advances of the as&#8208;fabricated SP&#8208;TiNb2O7 in achieving superior electrochemical performance.&#160;Particularly, the advances of such an anode were verified in practical 5 Ah&#8208;level laminated full pouch cell. The as&#8208;assembled LiFePO4||TiNb2O7 full cell exhibited a high capacity of 5.08 Ah at high charging rate of 6 C (77.9% of that at 0.2 C of 6.52 Ah), as well as an ultralow capacity decay rate of 0.0352% for 250 cycles at 1 C.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical Porous Aerogels With Multiple Adsorptive Interactions for Dye Wastewater Purification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aerogels present a huge potential for removing organic dyes from printing and dyeing wastewater (PDW). However, the preparation of aerogels with multiple dye adsorption capabilities remains a challenge, as many existing aerogels are limited to adsorbing only a single type of dye. Herein, a composite aerogel (CG/T&#8208;rGO) with the addition of carboxymethyl chitosan, gelatin and tannic acid reduced graphene oxide (T&#8208;rGO) was synthesized by freeze&#8208;drying technology. The electrostatic interactions between dye molecular and GEL/CMCS (CG) networks, as well as the supramolecular interactions (H&#8208;bonds, electrostatic interactions and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacks) between T&#8208;rGO, have endowed the aerogel with the ability to adsorb multiple types of dye, such as methylene blue (MB) and methyl orange (MO). Results exhibited that the prepared CG/T&#8208;rGO aerogel possessed strong mechanical strength and a porous 3D network structure with a porosity of 96.33%. Using MB and MO as adsorbates, the adsorption capacity (88.2mg/g and 66.6 mg/g, respectively) and the mechanism of the CG/T&#8208;rGO aerogel were investigated. The adsorption processes of aerogel for MB and MO were shown to follow the pseudo&#8208;second&#8208;order kinetic model and Langmuir isotherm model, indicating the chemical adsorption of a monolayer. The proposed aerogel in this work has promising prospects for dye removal from PDW.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Scholl Reaction on Phenylated Cyclopentadiene Core: One&#8208;Step Synthesis of Fluoreno[5]helicenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we explore feasibility of the mechanochemical approach in the synthesis of tetrabenzofluorenes (fluoreno[5]helicenes). For this, commercially available phenylated cyclopentadiene precursors are subjected to the Scholl reaction in the solid state using FeCl3 as an oxidant and sodium chloride as the solid reaction medium. This ball milling process gave access to the 5&#8208;membered ring containing&#8208;helicenes in one synthetic step in high (95&#8208;96%) isolated yields. The solution&#8208;phase reactions, however, were found to be moderate to low yielding in this regard (10&#8208;40%).</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the role of metal in the biointeraction of metallacarboranes with C. elegans embryos.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cobaltabis(dicarbollides), ferrabis(dicarbollide), and their halogenated derivatives are the most studied metallacarboranes with great medical potential. These versatile compounds and their iodinated derivatives can be used in chemotherapy, radiotherapy, particle therapy, and bioimaging when isotopes are used. These metallacarboranes have been evaluated in vitro and recently in vivo with complex animal models. Lately, these studies have been complemented using the invertebrate Caenorhabditis elegans , a nematode largely used in toxicology. When evaluated at the L4 stage, cobaltabis(dicarbollides), ([o&#8208;COSAN]&#8208; and [8,8&#8217;&#8208;I2&#8208;o&#8208;COSAN]&#8208;), exhibited a higher mean lethal dose (LD50) than ferrabis(dicarbollides) ([o&#8208;FESAN]&#8208; and [8,8&#8217;&#8208;I2&#8208;o&#8208;FESAN]&#8208;).
In this work, we use the C. elegans embryos since they are a complex biological barrier with concentric layers of polysaccharides and proteins that protect them from the environment. We assessed if the metal atom changes their biointeraction with the C. elegans embryos. First, we assessed the effects on embryo development for metallacarboranes and their di&#8208;iodinated derivatives. We observed changes in color and in their surface structure. An exhaustive physicochemical characterization was performed to understand better this interaction, revealing a stronger interaction of ferrabis(dicarbollide) compounds with C. elegans embryos than the cobaltabis(dicarbollide) molecules. Unveiling the biological interaction of these compounds is of great interest for their future biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Support Engineering for the Stabilisation of Heterogeneous Pd3P&#8208;Based Catalysts for Heck Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report the use of a supported Pd3P catalyst for Heck coupling reactions. For the stabilisation of Pd3P and Pd, as reference system, the silica support material was modified via phosphorus doping (0.5 and 1 wt.% P). Through this so&#8208;called support engineering approach, the catalytic activity of Pd3P was clearly enhanced. Whereas an iodobenzene conversion of 79% was witnessed for Pd3P@SiO2 in the coupling of styrene and iodobenzene in 1h, 90% conversion could be achieved using Pd3P@1P&#8208;SiO2. This improved catalytic activity probably stems from an electronic modulation of the support surface via the introduction of phosphorus. Simultaneously, the recyclability was boosted and the Pd3P@1P&#8208;SiO2 catalyst has shown to maintain its catalytic activity over several recovery tests. Hereby, metal leaching could almost be suppressed completely to 3% by the use of a P&#8208;modified silica support.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Perchlorate Sensing using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy with Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers of semiaza&#8208;Bambusurils</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the last two decades, perchlorate salts have been identified as environmental pollutants and recognized as potential substances affecting human health. We describe self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) of novel semiaza&#8208;bambus[6]urils (semiaza&#8208;BUs) equipped with thioethers or disulfide (dithiolane) functionalities as surface&#8208;anchoring groups on gold electrodes.&#160;Cyclic voltammetry (CV) with Fe(CN)63&#8208;/4&#8208; as a redox probe, together with X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and ellipsometry, were employed to characterize the interactions at the interface between the anchoring groups and the metal substrate. Data showed that the anion receptors' packing on the gold strongly depends on the anchoring group. As a result, SAMs of BUs with lipoic amide side chains show a concentration&#8208;dependent layer thickness. The BU SAMs are extremely stable on repeated electrochemical potential scans and can selectively recognize perchlorate anions. Our electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies indicated that semiaza&#8208;BU equipped with the lipoic amide side chains binds perchlorate (2&#8208;100 mM) preferentially over other anions such as F&#8208;, Cl&#8208;, I&#8208;, AcO&#8208;, H2PO4&#8208;, HPO42&#8208;, SO42&#8208;, NO2&#8208;, NO3&#8208;, or CO32&#8208;. The resistance performance is 10 to 100 times more efficient than SAMs containing all other tested anions.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization of Diborynes versus Destabilization of Diborenes by Coordination of Lewis Bases. Unraveling the Dichotomy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have quantum chemically investigated the boron&#8211;boron bonds in B2, diborynes B2L2, and diborenes B2H2L2 (L = none, OH2, NH3) using dispersion&#8208;corrected relativistic density functional theory at ZORA&#8208;BLYP&#8208;D3(BJ)/TZ2P. B2 has effectively a single B&#8211;B bond provided by two half &#960; bonds, whereas B2H2 has effectively a double B=B bond provided by two half &#960; bonds and one &#963; 2p&#8208;2p bond. This different electronic structure causes B2 and B2H2 to react differently to the addition of ligands. Thus, in B2L2, electron&#8208;donating ligands shorten and strengthen the boron&#8211;boron bond whereas, in B2H2L2, they lengthen and weaken the boron&#8211;boron bond. The aforementioned variations in boron&#8211;boron bond length and strength become more pronounced as the Lewis basicity of the ligands L increases.</dc:description>

         <title>Straightforward Synthesis of Pentagon&#8208;Embedded Expanded [11]Helicenes for Radiative Cooling Property</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two novel pentagon&#8208;embedded carbo[11]helicenes have been designed and synthesized in a three&#8208;step process, which are the first example of carbo[11]helicenes through the post&#8208;functionalization of twistacene. TD&#8208;DFT analyses indicate that both of them possess high enantiomerization barriers of 42.29 kcal/mol and 40.76 kcal/mol, respectively. They emit strong red fluorescence and can be chemically oxidized into stable cationic radicals upon addition of AgSbF6 evidenced by the bathochromic&#8208;shifted absorption spectra and the appearance of electronic paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signals. In addition, such helical derivatives can be chosen as radiative cooling materials in a glass model house, and the maxima of 5.4 oC for the former and 6.5 oC for the latter are found in the comparative tests, which might be caused by the NIR reflective response.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion Tuned Structural Modulation and Nonlinear Optical Effects of Metal&#8208;Ion Directed 310&#8208;Helix Networks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metals play an important role in the structure and functions of various proteins. The combination of metal ions and peptides have been emerging as an attractive field to create advanced structures and biomaterials. Here, we are reporting the anion&#8208;influenced, silver ion coordinated diverse networks of designed short tripeptide 310&#8208;helices with terminal pyridyl groups. The short peptides adopted classical right&#8208;handed, left&#8208;handed and 310EL&#8208;helical conformations in the presence of different silver salts. The peptides have displayed conformational flexibility to accommodate different sizes and interactions of anions to yield a variety of metal&#8208;coordinated networks. The complexes of metal ions and peptides have shown different porous networks, right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed helical polymers, transformation of helix into superhelix and 2:2 metal&#8208;peptide macrocycles. Further, the metal&#8208;peptide crystals with inherent dipoles of helical peptides gave striking second harmonic generation response. The optical energy upconversion from NIR to red light is demonstrated. Overall, we have shown the utilization of short 310&#8208;helices for the construction of diverse metal&#8208;coordinated helical networks and notable non&#8208;linear optical effects.</dc:description>

         <title>J&#8208;Aggregate&#8208;Triggering BODIPYs: an Ultrasensitive Chromogenic and Fluorogenic Sensing Platform for Perfluorooctanesulfonate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Contamination of water supplies by polyfluoroalkyl substances, notably perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), has serious health and environmental consequences. Therefore, the development of straightforward and effective means of monitoring and removing PFASs is urgently required. In this study, we report a rapid and sensitive method for the detection of PFOS and PFOA in water that rely on the J&#8208;aggregate formation of meso&#8208;ester&#8208;BODIPY dyes. The dye C10&#8208;mim, which contains a hydrophilic methylimidazolium group and a hydrophobic alkylated BODIPY, self&#8208;assembles in water into weakly green&#8208;emissive micellar assemblies. Upon binding to PFOS or PFOA, a spontaneous disassembly and reorganization forms orange&#8208;emissive J&#8208;aggregates. The rapid formation (&#8804;&#160;5 s) of J&#8208;aggregates and the accompanying spectral shifts provide a superior sensing performance, with excellent sensitivity (limit of detection = 0.18 ppb for PFOS) and distinct chromogenic and fluorogenic &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; responses.</dc:description>

         <title>Enrichment Strategies for Efficient CO2 Electroreduction in Acidic Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enriching CO2 and key intermediates around the catalyst surface can promote the reaction rate and selectivity, providing a promising way to boost the performance of CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). In this review, the key technique challenges of acidic CO2RR are first introduced. Then, the critical progress of the enrichment strategy for promoting the acidic CO2RR is summarized with three aspects: catalyst design, electrolyte regulation, and electrolyzer optimization. Finally, some insights and perspectives for further development of enrichment strategy in acidic CO2RR are expounded.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has been recognized as an appealing route to remarkably accelerate the carbon&#8208;neutral cycle and reduce carbon emissions. Notwithstanding great catalytic activity that has been acquired in neutral and alkaline conditions, the carbonates generated from the inevitable reaction of the input CO2 with the hydroxide severely lower carbon utilization and energy efficiency. By contrast, CO2RR in an acidic condition can effectively circumvent the carbonate issues; however, the activity and selectivity of CO2RR in acidic electrolytes will be decreased significantly due to the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Enriching the CO2 and the key intermediates around the catalyst surface can promote the reaction rate and enhance the product selectivity, providing a promising way to boost the performance of CO2RR. In this review, the catalytic mechanism and key technique challenges of CO2RR are first introduced. Then, the critical progress of enrichment strategies for promoting the CO2RR in the acidic electrolyte is summarized with three aspects: catalyst design, electrolyte regulation, and electrolyzer optimization. Finally, some insights and perspectives for further development of enrichment strategies in acidic CO2RR are expounded.

         <title>A General Strategy for Increasing the Air Stability of Phosphines Including Primary Phosphines</title>

Singling out the singlet: A general approach for increasing the air&#8208;stability of various primary phosphines in the absence of kinetic stabilization is presented based on the quenching of singlet oxygen. It proves singlet oxygen to be the key initiator in the oxidation of phosphines.







Abstract
A general approach for increasing the air&#8208;stability of various primary phosphines in the absence of kinetic stabilization is presented that contrasts with previous interpretations, which were limited to specific phosphines. This contribution shows the synthesis of a series of air&#8208;stable primary phosphines Fc(CH2)nPH2, where n=0,1,2,3; and Fc=ferrocenyl, and their corresponding isolable primary phosphine oxides. It was demonstrated that the ferrocene moiety exerts an antioxidant effect on the primary phosphine group, which is intermolecular, solvent dependent and increases with the electron density on the ferrocene moiety. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the presence of ferrocene in solution also inhibits the oxidation of other secondary and tertiary phosphines in air. Together our findings suggest that quenching of singlet oxygen is the actual reason for the antioxidant effect; this was experimentally confirmed by using other established singlet oxygen quenchers, thus demonstrating a key role of singlet oxygen in the aerobic oxidation of phosphines.

         <title>Synthesis and Anticancer Activity of Phosphinoylated and Phosphonoylated N&#8208;Heterocycles Obtained by the Microwave&#8208;Assisted Palladium Acetate&#8208;Catalyzed Hirao Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
The bromo derivatives of 9&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazoles and an indoline were converted to the corresponding phosphonoyl and phosphinoyl derivatives by the microwave&#8208;assisted &#8220;P&#8208;ligand&#8208;free&#8221; Hirao P&#8722;C coupling. A part of the fifteen phosphorylated N&#8208;heterocycles showed significant cytotoxic effect on A549 human non&#8208;small&#8208;cell lung carcinoma and MonoMac&#8208;6 acute monocytic leukemia cell cultures.







Abstract
A literature survey showed that different derivatives with the 9&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole or the dihydroindoline scaffold may be of biological activity including cytotoxic effect. Driven by this experience, P&#8208;functionalized derivatives of these N&#8208;heterocycles were synthesized. Three N&#8208;heterocycles, 9&#8208;(4&#8208;bromophenyl)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole, 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;9&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole and 1&#8208;(5&#8208;bromoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;one, were coupled with dialkyl phosphites and diarylphosphine oxides using Pd(OAc)2 (10&#8201;%) as the catalyst precursor and triethylamine as the base in ethanol under microwave irradiation. The excess of the Y2P(O)H reagent (Y=alkoxy, aryl) (30&#8201;%) served as the P&#8208;ligand in its trivalent tautomeric form (Y2POH), hence there was no need for the usual P&#8208;ligands meaning cost and environmental burden. Hence, the presented method is a &#8220;green&#8221; approach that proved to be more efficient than the preparation by the traditional method. The products, dialkyl phosphonates and tertiary phosphine oxides obtained in 58&#8211;84&#8201;% yields were characterized, one of them also by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis, and were subjected to in&#8197;vitro biological activity evaluation. A (carbazol)yl&#8208;phenylphosphonate, an N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;(carbazol)yl&#8208;phosphonate, a (carbazol)yl&#8208;phenylphosphine oxide and an N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;(carbazol)ylphosphine oxide revealed a significant cytotoxic activity on A549 human non&#8208;small&#8208;cell lung carcinoma and MonoMac&#8208;6 acute monocytic leukemia cancer cells. The cytotoxic effect was significant as compared to that of the reference compounds.

         <title>Challenges in the Direct Detection of Chirality&#8208;induced Spin Selectivity: Investigation of Foldamer&#8208;based Donor&#8208;acceptor Dyads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct spectroscopic detection of the chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect can shed light on the complex relationship between chirality and electron spin. This work deals with the photophysical investigation of novel D&#8208;&#967;&#8208;A dyads, comprising pyrene (D) and fullerene (A) connected by chiral saturated peptide bridges (&#967;) of different length and electric dipole moment.







Abstract
Over the past two decades, the chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect was reported in several experiments disclosing a unique connection between chirality and electron spin. Recent theoretical works highlighted time&#8208;resolved Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (trEPR) as a powerful tool to directly detect the spin polarization resulting from CISS. Here, we report a first attempt to detect CISS at the molecular level by linking the pyrene electron donor to the fullerene acceptor with chiral peptide bridges of different length and electric dipole moment. The dyads are investigated by an array of techniques, including cyclic voltammetry, steady&#8208;state and transient optical spectroscopies, and trEPR. Despite the promising energy alignment of the electronic levels, our multi&#8208;technique analysis reveals no evidence of electron transfer (ET), highlighting the challenges of spectroscopic detection of CISS. However, the analysis allows the formulation of guidelines for the design of chiral organic model systems suitable to directly probe CISS&#8208;polarized ET.

         <title>Surface Modification Functionalized Carbon Dots</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon dot materials are widely used in optoelectronic parts, biomedicine and detection fields because of their excellent optical properties. However, the performance of unmodified CDs materials in various fields of application is unsatisfactory. Therefore, there is an urgent need to review the construction methods of surface modification strategies for functional CDs materials in order to promote the continuous development of this field.







Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) smaller than 10&#8197;nm constitute a new type of fluorescent carbon&#8208;based nanomaterial. They have attracted much attention owing to their unique structures and excellent photoelectric properties. Primitive CDs usually comprise carbon and oxygen and are synthesized in one step from various natural products or synthetic organic compounds, usually via microwave or hydrothermal methods. However, the uniformity of surface functional groups often make CDs lack the diversity of active sites required for specific applications. Therefore, the functionalization of CDs by specific groups is a powerful strategy for improving their photophysical and photochemical properties. This paper reviews surface modification strategies to overcome these shortcomings. Functionalizing CDs using covalent or non&#8208;covalent modification can give them unique properties and broaden their applicability.

         <title>The Calculation of Both Electrostatic and Van der Waals Effects to Probe the Efficiency of Solvent Extraction of Heterocyclic Aromatics from Heavy Oil</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To resolve the contradiction between denitrification efficiency and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) loss due to complex interactions, a combined model is proposed to evaluate the extraction performance in experiments. It is essential for the preparation of low nitrogen feedstock for a wide range of carbon materials.







Abstract
Due to the complex composition and similar structure, the extraction denitrification of aromatic rich oil is faced with the contradiction problem of denitrification efficiency and aromatic loss which cannot be efficiently solved by experiments. However, the complex interactions involved can be analyzed from the perspective of calculation, and the prediction criteria and methods are proposed. Based on rigorous density functional theory calculation data, Simple models based on electrostatic potential (ESP) and Van der Waals potential (VdWP)&#8208;based calculations were established and validated. The twofold model provided the best prediction for interactions between extractants and nitrogen compounds and between extractants and aromatics, which determines denitrification efficiency and aromatic loss, respectively, due to the most complete description of both electrostatic and VdW force. This provides a powerful tool for evaluating the non&#8208;covalent interactions and thence tuning the efficiency of the separation process. Thus, high denitrification efficiency (43.2~66.3&#8201;%) and moderate aromatic loss (1.7~4.4&#8201;%) were obtained using screened deep eutectic solvents (DESs). This ideal observation provided the potential for mild hydrodesulfurization and manufacture of high&#8208;grade carbon materials.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Quinone Compounds Derived from Doubly and Triply Linked Diporphyrins and Tuning of Their Absorption Properties
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel quinones derived from two types of diporphyrins (diporphyrinquinones D and T) have been synthesized and characterized. D exhibits broad panchromatic absorption properties with significant red&#8208;shifts to 1300&#8197;nm upon metalation, whereas T exhibits intense and sharp absorption bands, along with a small absorption peak at longer wavelengths.







Abstract
Porphyrins are attracting increasing attention in materials science and photochemistry owing to their unique properties and diverse applications. This study focuses on modifying and tuning the absorption properties of porphyrins, specifically those of quinoidal porphyrins, to extend their spectral range into the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region. We report the synthesis and structural and physical properties of quinone compounds derived from doubly and triply linked diporphyrins and their metal complexes. Doubly linked diporphyrinquinone exhibits broad panchromatic absorption properties in solution owing to its low symmetry. Metal complexation markedly extends its absorption range into the near&#8208;infrared region. In contrast, the metal complexes of the triply linked diporphyrinquinones exhibit sharp and strong absorption bands in the visible to near&#8208;infrared region owing to their higher symmetry. The longest absorption wavelength of the triply linked diporphyrinquinones was approximately 1500&#8197;nm, which was significantly more red&#8208;shifted than that of the doubly linked ones.

This study focuses on modifying and tuning the absorption properties of porphyrins, specifically those of quinoidal porphyrins, to extend their spectral range into the near-infrared (NIR) region. We report the synthesis and structural and physical properties of quinone compounds derived from doubly and triply linked diporphyrins and their metal complexes. Doubly linked diporphyrinquinone exhibits broad panchromatic absorption properties in solution owing to its low symmetry. Metal complexation markedly extends its absorption range into the near-infrared region. In contrast, the metal complexes of the triply linked diporphyrinquinones exhibit sharp and strong absorption bands in the visible to near-infrared region owing to their higher symmetry. The longest absorption wavelength of the triply linked diporphyrinquinones was approximately 1500&#8197;nm, which was significantly more red-shifted than that of the doubly linked ones.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Iron(II) Complexes of P3&#8208;Chain Ligands: Structural Diversity</title>

Iron(II) complexes containing a R2P&#8722;P&#8722;PR2 unit were synthetized. The binding modes of the triphosphane ligands can be changed by the size of the substituents. The products were characterized by NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.







Abstract
Iron(II) complexes containing ligands with a R2P&#8722;P&#8722;PR2 unit were synthesized by metathesis reactions. With R=tBu, a mixture of two isomers is formed; in one of them, the terminal phosphorus binds to the Fe center (ylidic structure), while in the other one, the central P atom is linked to Fe. Starting from differently functionalized parent triphosphanes and corresponding functionalized Fe complexes, the ratio of isomers does not change. The outcome of the reaction and therefore the binding modes of the triphosphane ligands in the resulting compounds can be influenced by the size of the substituents. In the case of R=iPr a chelate complex is formed (both terminal P atoms are linked to the Fe center). Applying the mixed&#8208;substituted triphosphane, the ylidic structure of the resulting complex is preferred. The new compounds were characterized by NMR spectroscopy in solution and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction in solid&#8208;state. The synthetic work was supported by DFT calculations.

         <title>Graphene Oxide Nanosheets Hamper Glutamate Mediated Excitotoxicity and Protect Neuronal Survival In An In vitro Stroke Model</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In vitro models of ischemic stroke based on the cell damage of dissociated central nervous system cultures due to glucose and oxygen deprivation (OGD) or to the exposure to a high concentration of glutamate (Glut) were used to establish that s&#8208;GO, applied during the glutamate mediated excitotoxic cascade, by modulating synaptic over&#8208;activity, exerts a protective effect, thus promoting neuronal survival and integrity.







Abstract
Small graphene oxide (s&#8208;GO) nanosheets reversibly downregulate central nervous system (CNS) excitatory synapses, with potential developments as future therapeutic tools to treat neuro&#8208;disorders characterized by altered glutamatergic transmission. Excitotoxicity, namely cell death triggered by exceeding ambient glutamate fueling over&#8208;activation of excitatory synapses, is a pathogenic mechanism shared by several neural diseases, from ischemic stroke to neurodegenerative disorders. In this work, CNS cultures were exposed to oxygen&#8208;glucose deprivation (OGD) to mimic ischemic stroke in&#8197;vitro, and it is show that the delivery of s&#8208;GO following OGD, during the endogenous build&#8208;up of secondary damage and excitotoxicity, improved neuronal survival. In a different paradigm, excitotoxicity cell damage was reproduced through exogenous glutamate application, and s&#8208;GO co&#8208;treatment protected neuronal integrity, potentially by directly downregulating the synaptic over&#8208;activation brought about by exogenous glutamate. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study suggests that s&#8208;GO may find novel applications in therapeutic developments for treating excitotoxicity&#8208;driven neural cell death.

         <dc:description>
Amides can be converted into gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes. The reaction involves interaction of &#945;&#8208;chloroiminium salts with difluorinated phosphorus ylide formed from difluorocarbene and triphenylphosphine.







Abstract
A metal&#8208;free one&#8208;pot process for the gem&#8208;difluoroolefination of amides is described. The reaction is based on interaction of generated in&#8197;situ &#945;&#8208;chloroiminium salts with difluorinated phosphorus ylide formed from difluorocarbene and triphenylphosphine. The olefination involves nucleophile&#8208;assisted dephosphorylation and proceeds within one hour at low temperature. The gem&#8208;difluoroenamines were used in further transformations leading to a variety of fluoroalkylated amines.

         <title>Synergistic Activation of Inert Iron Oxide Basal Planes through Heterostructure Formation and Doping for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ni&#8722;Fe2O3/CeO2 HSs catalyst was synthesized via a facile solvothermal reaction and subsequent annealing process. The catalyst demonstrated exceptional stability and hydrogen evolution activity, which can be attributed to the synergistic activation of the basal planes of iron oxide through heterostructure engineering and nickel doping. Furthermore, the incorporation of nickel into the catalyst conferred low&#8208;temperature resistance, with high HER activity even at 0&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Iron oxides have emerged as a very promising and cost&#8208;effective alternative to precious metal catalysts for hydrogen production. However, the inert basal plane of iron oxides needs to be activated to enhance their catalytic efficiency. In this study, we employed heterostructure engineering and doped nickel to cooperatively activate the basal planes of iron oxide (Ni&#8722;Fe2O3/CeO2 HSs) to achieve high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. The Ni&#8722;Fe2O3/CeO2 HSs electrocatalyst demonstrates excellent basic HER activity and stability, such as an extremely low overpotential of 43&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 current density and corresponding Tafel slope of 58.6&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1. The increase in electrocatalyst activity and acceleration of hydrogen precipitation kinetics arises from the dual modulation of Ni doping and heterostructure, which not only modulates the electrocatalyst&#8216;s electronic structure, but also increases the number and exposure of active sites. Remarkably, the generation of heterogeneous structure makes the catalyst se. The Ni&#8208;doped catalyst has not only increased HER activity but also low&#8208;temperature resistance. These results suggest that the synergistic activation of inert iron oxide basal planes through heterostructure formation and doping is a feasible strategy. Furthermore, for efficient electrocatalytic water splitting, this technique can be extended to other non&#8208;noble metal oxides.

         <title>Photoinduced &#945;&#8208;Aminoalkylation of Sulfonylarenes with Alkylamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Aminoalkylation of sulfonylarenes with alkylamines was found to proceed successfully in the presence of a base in MeOH under photoirradiation, giving a wide variety of &#945;&#8208;arylalkylamines. The reaction is initiated by photolysis of the S&#8722;Ar bond of sulfonylarenes leading to generation of &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals, which get into a radical chain to give &#945;&#8208;arylalkylamines.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Aminoalkylation of sulfonylarenes with alkylamines was found to be induced by photoirradiation. Here various types of alkylamines, such as trialkylamines, dialkylamines, N,N&#8208;dialkylanilines and N&#8208;alkylanilines as well as sulfonylarenes containing an azole, azine, heterole or benzene ring are available. The reaction proceeds through a homolytic aromatic substitution (HAS) process consisting of addition of an &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radical to a sulfonylarene and elimination of the sulfonyl radical to give the &#945;&#8208;arylalkylamine, where photoirradiation is considered to induce homolysis of sulfonylarenes leading to the generation of &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals that make a radical chain operative.

Here various types of alkylamines, such as trialkylamines, dialkylamines, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-dialkylanilines and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-alkylanilines as well as sulfonylarenes containing an azole, azine, heterole or benzene ring are available. The reaction proceeds through a homolytic aromatic substitution (HAS) process consisting of addition of an &#945;-aminoalkyl radical to a sulfonylarene and elimination of the sulfonyl radical to give the &#945;-arylalkylamine, where photoirradiation is considered to induce homolysis of sulfonylarenes leading to the generation of &#945;-aminoalkyl radicals that make a radical chain operative.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanism of CO2 Reduction to Methanol with H2 on an Iron(II)&#8208;scorpionate Catalyst</title>

CO2 to methanol: Density functional theory calculations on the mechanism of the reduction of CO2 by H2 on an iron(II) center show the reaction to proceed through heterolytic cleavage of H2, whereby the ligand holds the proton during the reaction.







Abstract
CO2 utilization is an important process in the chemical industry with great environmental power. In this work we show how CO2 and H2 can be reacted to form methanol on an iron(II) center and highlight the bottlenecks for the reaction and what structural features of the catalyst are essential for efficient turnover. The calculations predict the reactions to proceed through three successive reaction cycles that start with heterolytic cleavage of H2 followed by sequential hydride and proton transfer processes. The H2 splitting process is an endergonic process and hence high pressures will be needed to overcome this step and trigger the hydrogenation reaction. Moreover, H2 cleavage into a hydride and proton requires a metal to bind hydride and a nearby source to bind the proton, such as an amide or pyrazolyl group, which the scorpionate ligand used here facilitates. As such the computations highlight the non&#8208;innocence of the ligand scaffold through proton shuttle from H2 to substrate as an important step in the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Fate of Oxidation States at Actinide Centers in Redox&#8208;Active Ligand Systems Governed by Energy Levels of 5&#8201;f Orbitals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

The direct reduction of NpVIO22+ to NpIV is facilitated by the interaction of NpVIO22+ with the redox&#8208;active ligand H2(tBu&#8208;pdiop), while the complexation of UVIO22+ with H2(tBu&#8208;pdiop) did not induce the reduction of UVIO22+. The different reactivity can be explained by the decrease of the energy of the 5&#8201;f orbitals in Np compared to those in U.







Abstract
We report the formation of a NpIV complex from the complexation of NpVIO22+ with the redox&#8208;active ligand tBu&#8208;pdiop2&#8722;=2,6&#8208;bis[N&#8208;(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)iminomethyl]pyridine. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of the direct complexation&#8208;induced chemical reduction of NpVIO22+ to NpIV. In contrast, the complexation of UVIO22+ with tBu&#8208;pdiop2&#8722; did not induce the reduction of UVIO22+, not even after the two&#8208;electron electrochemical reduction of [UVIO2(tBu&#8208;pdiop)]. This contrast between the Np and U systems may be ascribed to the decrease of the energy of the 5&#8201;f orbitals in Np compared to those in U. The present findings indicate that the redox chemistry between UVIO22+ and NpVIO22+ should be clearly differentiated in redox&#8208;active ligand systems.

         <title>The First Planar, Not Twisted, Distannene &#8722; A Structural Alkene Analog. Synthesis, Isolation and X&#8208;ray Crystallography Characterization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of the first planar non&#8208;twisted distannene 6 is reported. The X&#8208;ray molecular structure of 6 reveals a planar geometry of both Sn atoms (&#931;&#8737;Sn=359.87&#176;), a non&#8208;twisted Sn=Sn bond, and the shortest Sn=Sn bond of 2.599&#8197;&#197; among all known acyclic distannenes. Thus, 6 is the first distannene having a structure closely analogous to a classic alkene.







Abstract
The tetrasilyl&#8208;substituted distannene, (tBu2HSi)2Sn=Sn(SiHtBu2)2 6, was synthesized by mild thermolysis (70&#8201;&#176;C in hexane) of tris(di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;hydridosilyl)stannane 4. The X&#8208;ray crystallography structure of 6 reveals the following unusual structural properties: a planar geometry around both Sn atoms (&#931;&#8737;Sn=359.87&#176;), a non&#8208;twisted Sn=Sn double bond, and the shortest Sn=Sn double bond of 2.599&#8197;&#197; among all acyclic distannenes. Thus, compound 6 is the first reported distannene having a structure closely analogous to a classic alkene. Reactions of 6 with CCl4 or with 2,3&#8208;dimethylbuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene to produce 1,2&#8208;dichlorodistannane 9 and the [2+4] cycloadduct 10, respectively, are characteristic for a Sn=Sn double bond.

A cycloaddition&#8211;retro&#8208;electrocyclization (CA&#8208;RE) click reaction using nitrogen end&#8208;capped oligoynes is demonstrated. The reaction with tetracyanoetylene (TCNE) is fully regioselective and leads to TCBD (tetracyanobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;2,3&#8208;diyl) end&#8208;capped molecules. The optical and electronic properties of adducts were investigated and rationalized using DFT calculations.







Abstract
This study shows the first example of cycloaddition&#8211;retro&#8208;electrocyclization (CA&#8208;RE) click reaction involving nitrogen end&#8208;capped push&#8208;pull oligoynes. The reported CA&#8208;RE reaction with TCNE (tetracyanoethylene) is fully regioselective and leads exclusively to the unprecedented TCBD (tetracyanobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;2,3&#8208;diyl) end&#8208;capped carbon rods. The molecular structure of the products was unambiguously confirmed using X&#8208;ray single crystal diffraction and their optical and electronic properties were investigated experimentally and rationalized using DFT (density functional theory) calculations.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Properties on a Bisbenzofuropyrazine Core: Mechanochromism and Concentration&#8208;Controlled Vapochromism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

A novel &#960;&#8208;core system: bent&#8208;shaped bisbenzofuropyrazines were easily synthesized by the palladium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular double cyclization reaction. The unsubstituted derivative shows good solubility in spite of its rigid planar structure and provides three polymorphs with different mechanochromic luminescent properties. A ground sample of the sec&#8208;butylated derivative exhibits concentration&#8208;dependent unique vapochromic luminescent behavior.







Abstract
Stimulus&#8208;responsive organic materials with luminescence switching properties have attracted considerable attention for their practical applications in sensing, security, and display devices. In this paper, bent&#8208;type bisbenzofuropyrazine derivatives, Bent&#8208;H and Bent&#8208;sBu, with good solubilities were synthesized, and their physical and optical properties were investigated in detail. Bent&#8208;H gave three crystalline polymorphs, and they showed different luminescence properties depending on their crystal packing structures. In addition, Bent&#8208;H exhibited mechanochromic luminescence in spite of its rigid skeleton. Bent&#8208;sBu exhibited unique concentration&#8208;dependent vapochromic luminescence. Ground Bent&#8208;sBu was converted to blue&#8208;emissive, green&#8208;emissive, and green&#8208;emissive high&#8208;viscosity solution states at low, moderate, and high concentrations of CHCl3 vapor, respectively. This finding represents a concentration&#8208;dependent multi&#8208;phase transition with an organic solvent, which is of potent interest for application in sensing systems.

         <title>Highly Flexible and Self&#8208;Healing Supercapacitor Enabled by Physically Crosslinking Polymer Hydrogel Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogel with outstanding mechanical properties and self&#8208;healing ability based on poly N&#8208;hydroxyethyl acrylamide (PHEAA) is fabricated as electrolyte for supercapacitors. The supercapacitor is obtained with flexibility and self&#8208;healing ability, retaining 80&#8201;% specific capacitance after five cutting&#8208;healing cycles. Three supercapacitors in series could drive a parallel circuit of LED and clock.







Abstract
Preparation of flexible supercapacitors with excellent mechanical properties and self&#8208;healing properties is of great significance but still remains a challenge. A self&#8208;healable conductive hydrogel based on poly N&#8208;hydroxyethyl acrylamide (PHEAA) is fabricated as electrolyte for supercapacitors. The design of the physically cross&#8208;linked dual network, and rich hydrogen bonds endow the hydrogel with robust mechanical properties and strong self&#8208;healing ability. The hydrogel exhibited an excellent stretchability (723&#8201;%) and a high ionic conductivity (21.8&#8197;mS/cm). Specially, by in&#8197;situ growth of electrode film, a non&#8208;laminated supercapacitor is obtained with flexibility and self&#8208;healing ability. Due to the non&#8208;laminated structure, the supercapacitor can work stably under bending and punching. The supercapacitor possessed an areal capacitance of 253.1&#8197;mF/cm2 and the capacitance retention was 80&#8201;% after five cutting&#8208;healing cycles. The pseudo&#8208;capacitance contribution of the supercapacitor after self&#8208;healing was discussed. It is noteworthy that the supercapacitor maintains the ability to power a clock after self&#8208;healing.

         <title>Chiral TPE Foldamers in Macrocycles: Aggregation Enhanced Emission and Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral TPE foldamers were first constructed through macrocycle architectonics and the chiroptical properties were investigated. Aggregation enhanced emission and unusual circularly polarized luminescence can be discovered due to the folded conformation.







Abstract
Chiral macrocycles with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) have attracted increasing attention due to the rigid structure, symmetrical chiral geometry and large luminescence dissymmetry factors (glum). However, most chiral macrocycles are more emissive in solutions but have weakened fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;F) in aggregates, limiting their further application. In this paper, chiral macrocycle R/S&#8208;PhTPE was synthesized by combining chiral macrocycle architectonics with Z&#8208;o&#8208;phenyltetraphenylethylene (PhTPE) foldamer. Enhanced solution state emission and characteristic aggregation enhanced emission (AEE) effect can be observed for R/S&#8208;PhTPE due to the folded PhTPE conformation. Macrocycle immobilization and folded conformation endow PhTPE moiety with stable helical conformation. Most importantly, R/S&#8208;PhTPE exhibits opposite CPL signals compared with common chiral TPEs, demonstrating the evident impact of folded conformation. This work reports the first and deep insights into the chiroptical properties of chiral PhTPE foldamers, and will provide a new strategy to tune &#934;F and CPL signals of AIE active chiral macrocycles.

         <title>Polymorphism and Light&#8208;Driven Forward Movement of TPE Derivative Micro&#8208;Crystal due to ArH&#8208;pi Interactions Difference</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New TPE derivatives bearing p&#8208;AP groups: Among 5 kinds of crystals of TPE derivative, it is found for the first time that strong intermolecular ArH&#8208;pi interactions cause ACQ effect while weak ArH&#8208;pi interactions induce AIE phenomenon. The interactions also arouse photochromism, photodeformation and even the first forward rolling movement of crystal by UV light irradiation, providing promising materials in multimode anti&#8208;counterfeiting, photo&#8208;actuator and light&#8208;driven micro&#8208;vehicle.







Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) and aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) are two classes of opposite luminescence phenomena. It is almost impossible to show both AIE and ACQ effect simultaneously by the same molecule. However, here we report that a simple TPE derivative TAP&#8208;TPE grows into both AIE crystals and ACQ ones. It is found that equatorial, contact distance&#8208;longer and weak ArH&#8208;&#960; interactions exist in AIE crystals while vertical, contact distance&#8208;shorter and strong ArH&#8208;&#960; interactions appear in ACQ crystals. Theoretical calculation of electron density on the interaction atoms unveils that ACQ crystals have much larger change in electron density than AIE ones, suggesting that the intermolecular electron transfer aroused by the strong ArH&#8208;&#960; hydrogen bonds leads to ACQ phenomenon. This result provides a new insight into the emission mechanism in aggregation state. Interestingly, due to the ArH&#8208;pi interactions difference, only one of five kinds of crystals shows rapid photochromism, and can act as multimode anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials. Very exceptionally, for the first time we find that the photochromic micrometric rod&#8208;like crystal even makes forward rolling movement as it repeatedly bends and straightens by responding to on and off of the ultraviolet light irradiation, displaying potential for photo&#8208;actuator and light&#8208;driven micro&#8208;vehicle.

         <title>Palladium Complexes of N&#8208;Methylcorroles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Opening the corrole door to divalent cations: Inner&#8208;core N&#8208;methylation of corrole makes this contracted macrocycle a dianionic ligand, facilitating the coordination of divalent cations, otherwise difficult for the charge mismatch with pristine corroles. Pd complexes are obtained in good yields, showing interesting optical features for their practical applications.







Abstract
Alkylation of one of the inner&#8208;core nitrogen atoms is one possible approach to obtain dianionic corrole ligands, suitable for the coordination of divalent metal ions, such as PdII. Inner&#8208;core N&#8208;methylation can be obtained by treating the corrole with CH3I, but the reaction conditions should be optimized to limit the formation of the dimethylated derivative. Two regioisomers, the N&#8208;21 and the N&#8208;22 methyl derivatives are obtained from the reaction, with the first product achieved in a higher amount. Structural characterization of the reaction products evidenced the distortion induced by the introduction of the methyl groups; the N&#8208;methylcorroles are chiral compounds, and the enantiomers were separated by chromatography, with their absolute configuration assigned by ECD computation. Palladium insertion was achieved in the case of monosubstituted corroles, but not with the dimethylated macrocycle; X&#8208;ray characterization of the complexes showed the distortion of the macrocycles. The Pd complexes do not show luminescence emission, but are able to produce singlet oxygen upon irradiation. The PdII complexes were also inserted in human serum albumin (HSA) and dispersed in water; in this case, the protein protects the corroles from photobleaching, and a switch from the type II to the type I mechanism in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is observed.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alkylation of one of the inner-core nitrogen atoms is one possible approach to obtain dianionic corrole ligands, suitable for the coordination of divalent metal ions, such as Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;. Inner-core N-methylation can be obtained by treating the corrole with CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;I, but the reaction conditions should be optimized to limit the formation of the dimethylated derivative. Two regioisomers, the N-21 and the N-22 methyl derivatives are obtained from the reaction, with the first product achieved in a higher amount. Structural characterization of the reaction products evidenced the distortion induced by the introduction of the methyl groups; the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methylcorroles are chiral compounds, and the enantiomers were separated by chromatography, with their absolute configuration assigned by ECD computation. Palladium insertion was achieved in the case of monosubstituted corroles, but not with the dimethylated macrocycle; X-ray characterization of the complexes showed the distortion of the macrocycles. The Pd complexes do not show luminescence emission, but are able to produce singlet oxygen upon irradiation. The Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complexes were also inserted in human serum albumin (HSA) and dispersed in water; in this case, the protein protects the corroles from photobleaching, and a switch from the type II to the type I mechanism in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is observed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Engaging strong electron acceptors in supramolecular donor&#8208;acceptor assembly to probe excited electron transfer. Metal&#8208;ligand axial coordination approach has been established to assemble zinc tetrapyrroles with TCBD/DCNQ to witness efficient electron transfer.







Abstract
Using the popular metal&#8208;ligand axial coordination self&#8208;assembly approach, donor&#8208;acceptor conjugates have been constructed using zinc tetrapyrroles (porphyrin (ZnP), phthalocyanine (ZnPc), and naphthalocyanine (ZnNc)) as electron donors and imidazole functionalized tetracyanobutadiene (Im&#8208;TCBD) and cyclohexa&#8208;2,5&#8208;diene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diylidene&#8208;expanded&#8208;tetracyanobutadiene (Im&#8208;DCNQ) as electron acceptors. The newly formed donor&#8208;acceptor conjugates were fully characterized by a suite of physicochemical methods, including absorption and emission, electrochemistry, and computational methods. The measured binding constants for the 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complexes were in the order of 104&#8211;105&#8197;M&#8722;1 in o&#8208;dichlorobenzene. Free&#8208;energy calculations and the energy level diagrams revealed the high exergonicity for the excited state electron transfer reactions. However, in the case of the ZnNc:Im&#8208;DCNQ complex, owing to the facile oxidation of ZnNc and facile reduction of Im&#8208;DCNQ, slow electron transfer was witnessed in the dark without the aid of light. Systematic transient pump&#8208;probe studies were performed to secure evidence of excited state charge separation and gather their kinetic parameters. The rate of charge separation was as high as 1011&#8197;s&#8722;1 suggesting efficient processes. These findings show that the present self&#8208;assembly approach could be utilized to build donor&#8208;acceptor constructs with powerful electron acceptors, TCBD and DCNQ, to witness ground and excited state charge transfer, fundamental events required in energy harvesting, and building optoelectronic devices. In summary, the powerful electron acceptors, TCBD and DCNQ, were functionalized to have a nitrogenous ligand, imidazole, for axial coordination of metal tetrapyrroles. Three zinc tetrapyrroles, viz., ZnP, ZnPc, and ZnNc varying in their redox potentials and spectral coverage were engaged as electron donors. Optical absorption studies provided evidence of axial coordination that was supported by computational studies. The measured bindings constants were in the range of 104&#8211;105&#8197;M&#8722;1 suggesting stable complexation. The facile reduction of DCNQ and facile oxidation of ZnNc led to slow ground&#8208;state electron transfer in the coordinated complex. However, such a charge separation process was rapidly facilitated upon photoexcitation in all the assembled systems as determined by their kCS values. The measured kCS values followed the expected free&#8208;energy trends while the magnitude of their kCR suggested the process to belong to the normal region of Marcus parabola. Further studies along this line are in progress in our laboratories.

         <title>Isolated Dimers Versus Solid&#8208;State Dimers of N&#8208;Heteropolycycles: Matrix&#8208;Isolation Spectroscopy in Concert with Quantum Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, matrix isolation spectroscopy and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations are used together to analyse the structure and properties of weakly bound dimers of the two isomers benzo[a]acridine and benzo[c]acridine. Our measured experimental electronic absorbance spectra agree with simulated spectra calculated for the equilibrium structures of the dimers in gas&#8208;phase, but in contrast, disagree with the simulated spectra calculated for the structures obtained by optimising the experimental solid&#8208;state structures. This highlights the sensitivity of the electronic excitations with respect to the dimer structures. The comparison between the solid&#8208;state and gas&#8208;phase dimers shows how far the intermolecular interactions could change the geometric and electronic structure in a disordered bulk material or at device interfaces, imposing consequences for exciton and charge mobility and other material properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Localized Crystallization of Calcium Phosphates by Light&#8208;Induced Processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
4&#8208;Nitrophenylphosphate and calcium chloride were included inside an aqueous gel matrix for light&#8208;induced precipitation processes and the resulting calcium phosphate precisely reproduces the irradiated areas. These findings can contribute to more sophisticated reaction control in localized crystallization processes of calcium phosphate containing biomaterials. Scale bar 1&#8197;mm.







Abstract
Medical treatment options for bones and teeth can be significantly enhanced by taking control over the crystallization of biomaterials like hydroxyapatite in the healing process. Light&#8208;induced techniques are particularly interesting for this approach as they offer tremendous accuracy in spatial resolution. However, in the field of calcium phosphates, light&#8208;induced crystallization has not been investigated so far. Here, proof of principle is established to successfully induce carbonate&#8208;hydroxyapatite precipitation by light irradiation. Phosphoric acid is released by a photolabile molecule exclusively after irradiation, combining with calcium ions to form a calcium phosphate in the crystallization medium. 4&#8208;Nitrophenylphosphate (4NPP) is established as the photolabile molecule and the system is optimized and fully characterized. A calcium phosphate is crystallized exclusively by irradiation in aqueous solution and identified as carbonate apatite. Control over the localization and stabilization of the carbonate apatite is achieved by a pulsed laser, triggering precipitation in calcium and 4NPP&#8208;containing gel matrices. The results of this communication open up a wide range of new opportunities, both in the field of chemistry for more sophisticated reaction control in localized crystallization processes and in the field of medicine for enhanced treatment of calcium phosphate containing biomaterials.

         <title>Frustrated Lewis Pair Chelation in the p&#8208;Block</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) have been at the forefront of main group element&#8208;mediated small molecule activation for over 15&#8197;years. The utility of intramolecular FLPs as chelating ligands for the stabilization of low oxidation state p&#8208;block elements has been comparatively less explored. This review highlights recent progress in this emerging field and highlights spaces for further development.







Abstract
Frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) have been the subject of considerable study since the field's inception. While much of the research into FLPs has centered around small molecule activation for diverse stoichiometric and catalytic transformations, intramolecular FLPs also show promise as chelating ligands. The cooperative action of Lewis basic and acidic moieties enables intramolecular FLPs to stabilize low oxidation state centers and (consequently) reactive molecular fragments through a donor&#8208;acceptor approach, making them an attractive ligand class in main group element chemistry. This review outlines the state of FLP chelation to date throughout the p&#8208;block, encompassing primarily groups 13&#8211;16.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Frustrated Lewis pairs&lt;/b&gt; (FLPs) have been at the forefront of main group element-mediated small molecule activation for over 15&#8197;years. The utility of intramolecular FLPs as chelating ligands for the stabilization of low oxidation state p-block elements has been comparatively less explored. This review highlights recent progress in this emerging field and highlights spaces for further development.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) have been the subject of considerable study since the field's inception. While much of the research into FLPs has centered around small molecule activation for diverse stoichiometric and catalytic transformations, intramolecular FLPs also show promise as chelating ligands. The cooperative action of Lewis basic and acidic moieties enables intramolecular FLPs to stabilize low oxidation state centers and (consequently) reactive molecular fragments through a donor-acceptor approach, making them an attractive ligand class in main group element chemistry. This review outlines the state of FLP chelation to date throughout the p-block, encompassing primarily groups 13&#8211;16.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Stable Perovskite Solar Cells based on the Efficient Interaction between Pb2+ and Cyano Groups of 4&#8208;Aminophthalonitrile</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Defects present on the top surface of perovskite films have a pronounced detrimental impact on the photovoltaic performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Consequently, the development of effective defect passivation strategies has become key in enhancing both the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of PSCs. In this study, a small molecule material, 4&#8208;Aminophthalonitrile (4&#8208;APN), was introduced as a means to mitigate surface defects within perovskite films. Obviously, 4&#8208;APN effectively passivates the defects at grain boundaries by combining cyano groups (&#8722;C&#8801;N) with Pb2+, significantly reducing the density of defect states, inhibiting non&#8208;radiative recombination at the interface, and promoting the charge transfer efficiency from the perovskite layer to the hole transport layer. The 4&#8208;APN modification led to a significant upswing in the PCE, while concurrently bolstering the overall device stability. Importantly, the devices on 4&#8208;APN as passivation additive exhibited negligible performance degradation aging for 1200 h.</dc:description>

         <title>Generation of Bioactivity&#8208;tailored FK506/FK520 Analogs by CRISPR Editing in Streptomyces tsukubaensis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For a potential application of FK506 in the treatment of acute kidney failure only the FKBP12 binding capability of the compound is required while the immunosuppressive activity via calcineurin binding is considered as a likely risk to the patients. The methoxy&#8208;groups at C13 and C15 are thought to have significant influence on the immunosuppressive activity of the molecule. Consequently, FK506 analogs with different functionalities at C13 and C15 were generated by targeted CRISPR editing of the AT domains in module 7 and 8 of the biosynthetic assembly line in Streptomyces tsukubaensis. In addition, the corresponding FK520 (C21 ethyl derivative of FK506) analogs could be obtained by media adjustments. The compounds were tested for their bioactivity in regards to FKBP12 binding, BMP potentiation and calcineurin sparing. 15&#8208;desmethoxy FK506 was superior to the other tested analogs as it did not inhibit calcineurin but retained high potency towards FKBP12 binding and BMP potentiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Diversification of Simple Arenes into Complex (Amino)cyclitols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly oxygenated cyclohexanes, including (amino)cyclitols, are featured in natural products possessing a notable range of biological activities. As such, these building blocks are valuable tools for medicinal chemistry. While de novo synthetic strategies have provided access to select compounds, challenges including stereochemical density and complexity have hindered the development of a general approach to (amino)cyclitol structures. Herein, we report the use of arenophile chemistry to access dearomatized intermediates which are amenable to diverse downstream transformations. Practical guidelines were developed for the synthesis of natural and non&#8208;natural (amino)cyclitols from simple arenes through a series of strategic functionalization events.</dc:description>

         <title>Regular Arrays of Rod&#8208;Shaped Molecular Photoswitches: Synthesis, Preparation, Characterization, and Selective Photoswitching within Mono&#8208; and Bilayer Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We assembled photoresponsive mono&#8208; and bilayer systems with well&#8208;defined properties from rod&#8208;shaped molecules equipped with different photoswitches. Using properly chosen chromophores (diarylethene&#8208;based switch and unidirectional light&#8208;driven molecular motor), we then selectively targeted layers made of the same types of photoswitches using appropriate monochromatic light. UV&#8211;vis analysis confirmed smooth and unrestricted photoisomerization. To achieve this, we synthesized a new class of triptycene&#8208;based molecular pedestals adept at forming sturdy Langmuir&#8211;Blodgett films on a water&#8211;air interface. The films were smoothly transferred to gold and quartz surfaces. Repeated deposition afforded bilayer systems: one layer containing diarylethene&#8208;based photoswitches and the other a unidirectional light&#8208;driven molecular motor. Structural analysis of both mono&#8208; and bilayer systems revealed the molecules to be tilted with carboxylic functions pointing to the surface. At least two different polymorphs differing in monolayer thickness and tilt angle (&#8275;40&#176; and &#8275;60&#176;) were identified on the gold surface.</dc:description>

         <title>Confining Ionic Liquids in Developing Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The concept of confining ionic liquids (ILs) in developing quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes (QSSEs) has been proposed, where ILs are dispersed in polymer networks/backbones and/or filler/host pores, forming the so&#8208;called confinement, and great research progress and promising research results have been achieved. In this review, the progress and achievement in developing QSSEs using IL&#8208;confinement for lithium metal batteries (LMBs), together with advanced characterizations and simulations, were surveyed, summarized, and analyzed, where the&#160;influence of specific parameters, such as IL (type, content, etc.), substrate (type, structure, surface properties, etc.), confinement methods, and so on, was discussed. The confinement concept was further compared with the conventional one in other research areas. It indicates that the IL&#8208;confinement in QSSEs improves the performance of electrolytes, for example, increasing the ionic conductivity, widening the electrochemical window, and enhancing the cycle performance of the assembled cells, and being different from those in other areas, i.e., the IL&#8208;confinement concept in the battery area is in a broad extent. Finally, insights into developing QSSEs in LMBs with the confinement strategy were provided to promote the development and application of QSSE LMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Single Atom Stabilization of Phosphinate Ester&#8208;Containing Rhodamines Yields Cell Permeable Probes for Turn&#8208;On Photoacoustic Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is an emerging imaging technique that uses pulsed laser excitation with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light to elicit local temperature increases through non&#8208;radiative relaxation events, ultimately leading to the production of ultrasound waves. The classical xanthene dye scaffold has found numerous applications in fluorescence imaging, however, xanthenes are rarely utilized for PAI since they do not typically display NIR absorbance. Herein, we report the ability of Nebraska Red (NR) dyes to produce photoacoustic (PA) signal and provide a rational design approach to reduce the hydrolysis rate of ester containing dyes, affording cell permeable probes. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we construct the first cell permeable rhodamine&#8208;based, turn&#8208;on PAI imaging probe for hypochlorous acid (HOCl) with maximal absorbance within the range of commercial PA instrumentation. This probe, termed SNR700&#8208;HOCl, is capable of detecting exogenous HOCl in mice. This work provides a new set of rhodamine&#8208;based PAI agents as well as a rational design approach to stabilize esterified versions of NR dyes with desirable properties for PAI. In the long term, the reagents described herein could be utilized to enable non&#8208;invasive imaging of HOCl in disease&#8208;relevant model systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Resolution of Expanded Porphyrinoids: A Path to Persistent Chirality and Appealing Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality is a fundamental characteristic of nature. Expanded porphyrinoids and their analogues offer an attractive platform for delving into the intricacies of chirality. Expanded porphyrioids comprise pyrrolic macrocycles and related heterocyclic systems. As a class, expanded porphyrioids are widely recognized for their flexible structural features, nontrivial coordination capabilities, and intriguing optical and electronic properties. With limited exceptions, their inherent conformational flexibility coupled with a low racemization barrier allows for the facile interchange between enantiomers. As a result, achieving the effective chiral resolution of individual enantiomers and the subsequent exploration of their chiroptical properties represents a significant challenge. This review summarizes strategies used to realize the chiral resolution of expanded porphyrinoids and the understanding of intrinsic chiroptical properties that has emerged from these separation efforts. It is our hope that this review will serve not only to codify our current understanding of chiral expanded porphyrinoids, but also inspire advances in the generalized area of chiral functional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of N&#8208;N Biaryl Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atropisomers featuring a restricted rotational axis have emerged as important structural scaffolds in natural products, drug design, and asymmetric synthesis. Recently, N&#8208;N biaryl atropisomers have drawn increasing interest due to their unique structure and relatively stable axes. However, its asymmetric synthesis remains scarce compared to its well&#8208;developed C&#8208;C biaryl analogs. In this concept, we summarize the asymmetric synthesis of N&#8208;N biaryl atropisomers including N&#8208;N pyrrole&#8208;pyrrole, N&#8208;N pyrroleindole, N&#8208;N indole&#8208;indole, and N&#8208;N indole&#8208;carbazole, during which a series synthetic strategies are highlighted. Also, a synthetic evolution is briefly reviewed and an outlook of N&#8208;N biaryl atropisomers synthesis is offered.</dc:description>

         <title>Nucleophilicity of 4&#8208;(Alkylthio)&#8208;3&#8208;imidazoline Derived Enamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Imidazolidine&#8208;4&#8208;thiones (ITOs) are cyclic, secondary amines that were considered as potential prebiotic organocatalysts for light&#8208;driven &#945;&#8208;alkylations of aldehydes by bromoacetonitrile (BAN). Recent studies showed that the initially supplied ITOs represent the pre&#8208;catalyst because they undergo S&#8208;alkylation with BAN to give 4&#8208;(alkylthio)&#8208;3&#8208;imidazolines (TIMs). Given that the same reagent mix that undergoes light&#8208;driven &#945;&#8208;alkylations is also effective in the dark, we synthesized ten ITO&#8208; or TIM&#8208;derived enamines of aldehydes and characterized their nucleophilic reactivities by kinetic studies in acetonitrile. The experimental second&#8208;order rate constants k2 for reactions of enamines with benzhydrylium ions (reference electrophiles) were evaluated by the Mayr&#8208;Patz equation, lg k2(20&#176;C) = sN(N+E). The determined nucleophilicities N (and sN) reveal the reactivity profiles of these enamines under prebiotically relevant conditions as well as their potential for use in organocatalytic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic and Assembly Characteristics of Deep&#8208;Cavity Basket Acting as a Host for Inclusion Complexation of Mitoxantrone in Biotic and Abiotic Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the preparation and dynamic/assembly characteristics of vase&#8208;shaped basket&#160;13&#8208;&#160;along with its ability to form an inclusion complex with anticancer drug mitoxantrone in abiotic and biotic systems.&#160;This novel cavitand has a deep nonpolar pocket consisting of three naphthalimide sides fused to a bicyclic platform at the bottom while carrying polar glycines at the top. The results of&#160;1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR),&#160;1H NMR Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer&#160;(CEST), Calorimetry, Hybrid&#160;Replica Exchange Molecular Dynamics (REMD), and&#160;Microcrystal Electron Diffraction&#160;(MicroED) measurements are in line with&#160;1&#160;forming dimer [12]6&#8208;, to be in equilibrium with monomers&#160;1(R)3&#8208;(relaxed) and&#160;1(S)3&#8208;&#160;(squeezed). Through simultaneous line&#8208;shape analysis of&#160;1H NMR data, kinetic and thermodynamic parameters characterizing these equilibria were quantified.&#160;Basket&#160;1(R)3&#8208;&#160;includes anticancer drug mitoxantrone (MTO2+) in its pocket to give stable binary complex [MTO&#204;1]&#160;&#8211;&#160;(Kd&#160;= 2.1&#160;mM).&#160;Both&#160;in vitro&#160;and&#160;in vivo&#160;studies showed that the basket is nontoxic, while at a higher proportion with respect to MTO it reduced its cytotoxicity&#160;in vitro.&#160;With well&#8208;characterized internal dynamics and dimerization, the ability to include mitoxantrone, and biocompatibility, the stage is set to develop&#160;sequestering agents from&#160;deep&#8208;cavity baskets.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Number of &#960;&#8208;Electrons Involved in Stepwise Cycloaddition Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of higher&#8208;order cycloadditions has mainly been restricted by the requisite usage of highly conjugated and reactive &#960;&#8208;systems. Recent years have witnessed organocatalysis as a potent mediator for several of the challenges associated herein, rendering higher&#8208;order cycloadditions a legitimate option for achieving the selective construction of specific molecular scaffolds. These developments reinvigorate the efforts to try to understand the underlying principles for cycloadditions involving a higher numbers of &#960;&#8208;electrons than the &#8220;classical&#8221; cycloadditions; how do we properly address the impact which the addition of further &#960;&#8208;electrons have on the reactivity of a system? Herein, computational investigations of two model higher&#8208;order cycloaddition systems have been performed to try to provide insights on changes in energetic barriers induced by the presence of benzofusions in a position which is unobstructive to the reactivity. With experimental substantiation as support, these studies might open up for a discussion on whether the &#960;&#8208;electrons of benzofused systems simply act as spectator electrons, or play a tangible role on the observed reactivity to an extent, where a distinct nomenclature is meritable.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of dynamic structures with high recognition host&#8208;guest materials capable to host selectively small volatile molecules is an emergent field of research with both fundamental and applied implications. The challenge of exploring novel materials with advanced functionalities has led to the development of dynamic crystalline structures promoted by soft interactions.&#160;
Here, a new pure organic dynamic frameworks based on hexakis[60]fullerene that are held together by weak van der Waals interactions is described. This crystalline structure is capable of absorbing and releasing chloroform, through internal structural reorganization. This research provides new insight into the design of organic molecular crystals for selective adsorption applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Hypervalent Iodine Diazo Compounds and Their Application in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hypervalent iodine diazo reagents with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (EWG) connected to diazo methyl center were a type of donor&#8208;acceptor diazo compounds with potential reaction abilities similar to ordinary diazo compounds. Although several hypervalent iodine diazo reagents were synthesized and used in the nucleophilic substitution reactions as early as 1994, the synthesis and application of new iodine(III) diazo reagents have only been reported to a certain extent in recent years. In the presence of rhodium catalyst, photocatalyst, or nucleophiles, hypervalent iodine diazo reagents can be converted into rhodium&#8208;carbenes, diazomethyl radicals, ester radicals or nucleophilic intermediates, which can be used as key intermediates for the formation of chemical bonds. The aim of this review is to give an overview of hypervalent iodine diazo compounds in organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Concentration and Solvent&#8208;Induced Chiral Tuning by Manipulating Non&#8209;Proteinogenic Amino Acids in Glycoconjugate Supra&#8208;Scaffolds: Interaction with Protein, and Streptomycin Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We showed solvent&#8208; and concentration&#8208;triggered chiral tuning of the fibrous assemblies of two novel glycoconjugates Z&#8208;P(Gly)&#8208;Glu and Z&#8208;F(4&#8208;N)&#8208;Glu made by chemical attachment of Cbz&#8208;protected [short as Z)] non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids L&#8208;phenylglycine [short as P(Gly)] and 4&#8208;Nitro&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine [short as F(4&#8208;N)] with D&#8208;glucosamine [short as Glu]. Both biomimetic gelators can form self&#8208;healing and shape&#8208;persistent gels with a very low critical gelator concentration in water as well as in various organic solvents, indicating they are ambidextrous supergelators. Detailed spectroscopic studies suggested &#946;&#8208;sheet secondary structure formation during anisotropic self&#8208;aggregation of the gelators which resulted in the formation of hierarchical left&#8208;handed helical fibers in acetone with an interlayer spacing of 2.4 nm.&#160; After the physical characterization of the gels, serum protein interaction with the gelators was assessed, indicating they may be ideal for biomedical applications. Further, both gelators are benign, non&#8208;immunogenic, non&#8208;allergenic, and non&#8208;toxic in nature, which was confirmed by performing the blood parameters and liver function tests on Wister rats. Streptomycin&#8208;loaded hydrogels showed efficacious antibacterial activity in vitro and in vivo as well. Finally, cell attachment and biocompatibility of the hydrogels were demonstrated which opens a newer avenue for promising biomedical and therapeutic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H Activation of Drug (Derivative) Molecules with Pd(ll) Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review comprehensively analyses representative examples of Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H activation reactions and demonstrates their efficacy in converting C&#8722;H bonds at multiple positions within drug (derivative) molecules into diverse functional groups. These transformative reactions hold immense potential in medicinal chemistry, enabling the efficient and selective functionalization of specific sites within drug molecules, thereby enhancing their pharmacological activity and expanding the scope of potential drug candidates. Although notable articles have focused on late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization reactions of drug&#8208;like molecules using transition&#8208;metal catalysts, reviews specifically focusing on late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization reactions of drug (derivative) molecules using Pd(II) catalysts are required owing to their prominence as the most widely utilized metal catalysts for C&#8722;H activation and their ability to introduce a myriad of functional groups at specific C&#8722;H bonds. The utilization of Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation methodologies demonstrates impressive success in introducing various functional groups, such as cyano (CN), fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), aromatic rings, olefin, alkyl, alkyne, and hydroxyl groups, to drug (derivative) molecules with high regioselectivity and functional&#8208;group tolerance. These breakthroughs in late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H activation reactions serve as invaluable tools for drug discovery and development, thereby offering strategic options to optimize drug candidates and drive the exploration of innovative therapeutic solutions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The fluorobasic character of the strong oxidative fluorinator, XeF6, and the oxidative resistance of the [XeF5]+ and [Xe2F11]+ cations have been exploited for the syntheses of several novel Cr(VI) dianions. The reactions of XeF6 and CrO2F2 in anhydrous HF and in melts by direct fusion of the reactants yielded the first dinuclear Cr(VI) oxyfluoro&#8208;dianion salts, [XeF5]2[Cr2O4F6], [XeF5]2[Cr2O4F6]&#8729;4HF, [XeF5]2[Cr2O4F6]&#8729;2XeOF4, and mononuclear Cr(VI) oxyfluoro&#8208;dianion salt, [XeF5][Xe2F11][CrO2F4]. The salts were structurally characterized by low&#8208;temperature (LT) single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) and LT Raman spectroscopy. The [CrO2F4]2&#8722; and [Cr2O4F6]2&#8722; dianions have distorted octahedral cis&#8208;dioxo Cr(VI) coordination spheres in which two F&#8208;atoms are trans to one another and two F&#8208;atoms are trans to O&#8208;atoms. The [Cr2O4F6]2&#8722; dianion is the fluorine&#8208;bridged dimer of the [CrO2F3]&#8722; anion. Quantum&#8208;chemical (QC) calculations were used to obtain the energy&#8208;minimized, gas&#8208;phase geometries, and the calculated vibrational spectra of the gas&#8208;phase dianions and their ion&#8208;pairs which were used to aid in the vibrational frequency assignments of the crystalline salts. NBO and MEPS analyses and SCXRD show these salts are intimate ion&#8208;pairs in which their cations and anions interact through primarily electrostatic Xe&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;F &#963;&#8208;hole bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbodiimide and Isocyanate Hydroboration by a Cyclic Carbodiphosphorane Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report hydroboration of carbodiimide and isocyanate substrates catalyzed by a cyclic carbodiphosphorane catalyst. The cyclic carbodiphosphorane outperformed the other Lewis basic carbon species tested, including other zerovalent carbon compounds, phosphorus ylides, an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, and an N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin. Hydroborations of seven carbodiimides and nine isocyanates were performed at room temperature to form N&#8208;boryl formamidine and N&#8208;boryl formamide products. Intermolecular competition experiments demonstrated the selective hydroboration of alkyl isocyanates over carbodiimide and ketone substrates. DFT calculations support a proposed mechanism involving activation of pinacolborane by the carbodiphosphorane catalyst, followed by hydride transfer and B&#8211;N bond formation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Measuring glycosidase activity is important to monitor any aberrations in carbohydrate hydrolase activity, but also for the screening of potential glycosidase inhibitors. To this end, synthetic substrates are needed which provide an enzyme&#8208;dependent read&#8208;out upon hydrolysis by the glycosidase. Herein, we present two new routes for the synthesis of caged luminescent carbohydrates, which can be used for determining glycosidase activity with a luminescent reporter molecule. The substrates were validated with glycosidase and revealed a clear linear range and enzyme&#8208;dependent signal upon in situ generation of the luciferin moiety from the corresponding nitrile precursors. Besides, we showed that these compounds could directly be synthesized from unprotected glycosyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;fluorides in a two&#8208;step procedure with yields up to 75%. The intermediate methyl imidate appeared a key intermediate which also reacted with d&#8208;cysteine to give the corresponding d&#8208;luciferin substrate rendering this a highly attractive method for synthesizing glycosyl luciferins in good yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Based Fluorescent Supramolecular Polymers Without Conventional Chromophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescent supramolecular polymers have garnered significant attention due to their successful integration of supramolecular polymers and fluorescence, offering vast potential for applications in sensing, imaging, optoelectronics, and photonics. In this study, we present a novel supramolecular polymer based on P5&#8208;OH, derived from mono&#8208;substituted pillararene macrocycles. Notably, these formed supramolecular polymeric aggregates exhibit a prominent blue emission, representing a rare instance of fluorescent polymers devoid of conventional chromophores. Furthermore, through the modification of alkyl chain ending groups attached to pillar[5]arenes, slight shifts in the emission peak could be observed. This research expands the scope of functional supramolecular polymeric systems utilizing pillararenes, providing valuable insights for the design of innovative luminescent materials and optical devices.</dc:description>

         <title>A discrete, boron&#8208;containing triangular triradical</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A neutral boron&#8208;containing triangular triradical based on a triptycene derivative has been designed and synthesized. Its structure, bonding and physical property have been studied by EPR spectroscopy, SQUID magnetometry and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, as well as theoretical calculations. The triradical has a series of isosceles triangle conformations in the solution due to the Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion, leading to the splitting of the two low&#8208;lying doublet states. This factor together with negligible spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) of composing light atoms quenches the spin frustration. The work represents a rare example of a&#160; neutral through&#8208;space triangular triradical.</dc:description>

         <title>Sheet&#8208;Isolated MoS2 Used for Dispersing Pt Nanoparticles and its Application in Methanol Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is highly challenging to activate the basal plane and minimize the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking of MoS2 sheets, thus enhancing its catalytic performance. Here, we display an approach for making well&#8208;dispersed MoS2. By using the N&#8208;doped multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (NMWCNTs) as an isolation unit, the aggregation of MoS2 sheets was effectively reduced, favoring the dispersion of Pt nanoparticles (noted as Pt/NMWCNTs&#8208;isolated&#8208;MoS2). Excellent bifunctional catalytic performance for the methanol oxidation and oxygen reduction reaction (MOR/ORR) was demonstrated by the produced Pt/NMWCNTs&#8208;isolated&#8208;MoS2. In comparison to Pt nanoparticles supported on MoS2 (Pt/MoS2), the MOR activity (2314.14 mA mg&#8211;1Pt) and stability (317.69 mA mg&#8211;1 Pt after 2 h of operation) on Pt/NMWCNTs&#8208;isolatedMoS2 were 24 and 232 times higher, respectively. As for ORR, Pt/NMWCNTs&#8208;isolated&#8208;MoS2 holds large half&#8208;wave potential (0.88 V) and high stability (92.71% after 22 h of operation). This work presents a tactic for activating the basal planes and reducing the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking of 2D materials to satisfy their applications in electrocatalysis. In addition, the proposed sheet&#8208;isolation method can be used for fabricating other 2D materials to promote the dispersion of nanoparticles to apply in other fields of energy as well as the environment.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of bridged tetrazoles with promising properties and potential applications by a one&#8208;step Finkelstein reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Numerous nitramine bridged compounds which show promising combinations of properties have already been identified in the area of energetic materials. In this work, four new nitrazapropane bridged tetrazoles, as well as four new trinitrazaheptane tetrazoles and three oxapropane bridged tetrazoles were synthesized and fully characterized. These new compounds can all be synthesized by a simple, one&#8208;step synthesis using Finkelstein conditions. All of these new energetic materials were characterized using NMR spectroscopy, single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, vibrational analysis and elemental analysis. The thermal behaviour of these compounds was studied by differential thermal analysis (DTA) and partly by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The BAM standard method was used to determine the sensitivities towards impact (IS) and friction (FS). The enthalpies of formation were calculated at the CBS&#8208;4M level, and the energetic performances were calculated using the EXPLO5 (V6.06.01) computer code. The properties of the new compounds were compared to each other as well as to the known energetic material RDX. Moreover, the iron(II) and copper(II) perchlorate complexes with 1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;1,1&#8208;tetrazolylnitrazapropane as ligand were prepared and investigated.</dc:description>

         <title>Deamination of Polyols from the Glycolysis of Polyurethane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methylenedianiline (MDA) is a secondary, undesired, product of the glycolysis process of polyurethane (PU) scraps due to hydrolysis and pyrolysis side reactions. As an aromatic and carcinogen amine, MDA poses different problems in handling, transporting, and labelling recycled polyols derived from glycolysis, hindering the closure of PU recycling loop.Aiming to provide a solution to this issue, in this work different deaminating agents (DAs) where investigated with the purpose of analyzing their reactivity with MDA. A first part of the study was devoted to the analysis of MDA formation as a function of reaction time and catalyst concentration (potassium acetate) during glycolysis. It was observed that the amount of MDA increases almost linearly with the extent of PU depolymerization and catalyst content. Among the DAs analyzed 2&#8208;ethylhexyl glycidyl ether (2&#8208;EHGE), and acetic anhydride (Ac2O) showed interesting performance, allowing to diminish MDA content below the limit for labelling prescription in 30 minutes. PU rigid foams were therefore synthesized from the corresponding recycled products and characterized in terms of thermal and mechanical performance. Ac2O&#8208;deaminated polyols led to structurally unstable foams with poor compressive strength, while 2&#8208;EHGE&#8208;deaminated products allowed the production of foams with improved mechanical performance and unaltered thermal conductivity.</dc:description>

         <title>From One&#8208;dimensional Disordered Racemate to Ordered Racemic Conglomerates through Metal Coordination Driven Self&#8208;Assembly at the Liquid&#8208;Solid Interface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, there has been significant focus on investigating and controlling chiral self&#8208;assembly, specifically in the context of enantiomeric separation. This study explores the self&#8208;assembly behavior of 4&#8208;dodecyl&#8208;3,6&#8208;di(2&#8208;pyridyl)pyridazine (DPP&#8208;C12) at the interface between heptanoic acid (HA) and highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) using a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and multiscale molecular modeling. The self&#8208;assembled monolayer structure formed by DPP&#8208;C12 is periodic in one direction, but aperiodic in the direction orthogonal to it. These structures resemble 1D disordered racemic compounds. Upon introducing palladium [Pd(II)] ions, complexing with DPP&#8208;C12, these 1D disordered racemic compounds spontaneously transform into 2D racemic conglomerates, which is rationalized with the assistance of force&#8208;field simulations. Our findings provide insights into the regulation of two&#8208;dimensional chirality.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing Radical Addition to 1&#8208;Phosphabutadienes by Employing Muonium as a &#8220;Light Isotope&#8221; of Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding free radical addition to multiple bonds is important to elucidating the mechanistic details of addition polymerization reactions, albeit the fleeting radical intermediates are very difficult to detect by conventional methodologies. Muon spin spectroscopy (&#181;SR) is a highly sensitive method that can detect radical species at 106 spins (cf. EPR: 1012 spins, NMR: 1018 spins). Herein, we employ &#181;SR to detect the radical&#8208;addition products from three 1&#8208;phosphabutadiene monomers, P&#8208;analogues of isoprene. We show that muonium (Mu), a &#8220;light&#8221; H&#8208;atom surrogate, adds predominantly at the C4 position of the P1=C2&#8211;C3=C4 moiety to give unprecedented 1&#8208;phosphaallyl radicals as the major products. Our structural assignments are supported by assignment of muon, phosphorus and proton hyperfine coupling constants using DFT&#8208;calculations. A minor radical product is also detected that is tentatively assigned to an PC3&#8208;heterocyclic free radical. On the basis of DFT&#8208;predictions, we speculate that its formation may involve initial addition of Mu+ at the C3 position followed by electron capture. These studies provide rare insights into the prospective radical (or cationic) polymerization of 1&#8208;phosphabutadienes, which have previously been polymerized using anionic initiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering a Cl&#8208;&#8208;Modulated Light&#8208;Driven Na+ Pump</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microbial Na+&#8208;pumping rhodopsin (NaR) is a promising optogenetic tool due to its unique ability to transport Na+. Like most rhodopsin&#8208;based tools, NaR is limited to light&#8208;based control. In this study, our objective was to develop a novel mode of modulation for NaR beyond light control. By introducing a potential Cl&#8208; binding site near the putative Na+ release cavity, we engineered Nonlabens dokdonensis rhodopsin 2 (NdR2) to be modulated by Cl&#8208;, an essential chemical in organisms. The engineered NdR2 demonstrated an approximately two&#8208;fold increase in Na+ pump activity in the presence of 100 mM Cl&#8208; compared to Cl&#8208;&#8208;free solution. Increasing Cl&#8208; concentration decreased the lifetimes of the M and O intermediates accordingly. The analysis of competitive ion uptake suggested the bound Cl&#8208; may increase the Na+ affinity and selectivity. This chemical modulation allows for more diverse and precise control over cellular processes, advancing the development of next&#8208;generation optogenetic tools. Notably, our Cl&#8208;&#8208;modulated NdR2 establishes an innovative mechanism for linking Cl&#8208; to Na+&#8208;related processes, with potential applications in optogenetic therapies for related diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Niobium&#8208;Based Oxide for Anode Materials for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, it has become imperative to develop high energy density as well as high safety lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBS) to meet the growing energy demand. Among the anode materials used in LIBs, the currently used commercial graphite has low capacity and is a safety hazard due to the formation of lithium dendrites during the reaction. Among the transition metal oxide (TMO) anode materials, TMO based on the intercalation reaction mechanism has a more stable structure and is less prone to volume expansion than TMO based on the conversion reaction mechanism, especially the niobium&#8208;based oxide in it has attracted much attention. Niobium&#8208;based oxides have a high operating potential to inhibit the formation of lithium dendrites and lithium deposits to ensure safety, and have stable and fast lithium ion transport channels with excellent multiplicative performance. This review summarizes the recent developments of niobium&#8208;based oxides as anode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries, discusses the special structure and electrochemical reaction mechanism of the materials, the synthesis methods and morphology of nanostructures, deficiencies and improvement strategies, and looks into the future developments and challenges of niobium&#8208;based oxide anode materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Multifunctional Ni(OH)2&#8208;supported Core&#8208;shell Ni@Pd Nanocomposites for the Electro&#8208;oxidation of Small Organic Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the domain of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), the development of efficient and durable catalysts for the electro&#8208;oxidation of  small  organic molecules, especially of alcohols (methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol, et al.) has always been a hot topic. A large number of related electrocatalysts with splendid performance have been designed and synthesized till now, while the preparation processes of most of them are demanding on experimental operations and conditions. Herein, we put forward a facile and handy method for the preparation of multifunctional Ni(OH)2&#8208;supported core&#8208;shell Ni@Pd nanocomposites (Ni(OH)2/Ni@Pd NCs) with the assistance of galvanic replacement reaction (GRR) at room temperature and ambient pressure. As expected, the Ni(OH)2 substrate can prevent the aggregation of core&#8208;shell (CS) Ni@Pd nanoparticles (NPs) and inhibit the formation of COads and further prevent Pd from being poisoned. The synergistic effect between CS Ni@Pd NPs and Ni(OH)2 substrate and the electronic effect between Pd shell and Ni core contribute to the outstanding electrocatalytic performance for methanol, ethanol, and ethylene glycol oxidation in alkaline condition. This study provides a succinct method for the design and preparation of efficient Pd&#8208;based electrocatalysts for alcohol electro&#8208;oxidation.</dc:description>

The seven&#8208;membered D&#8208;ring and eight&#8208;membered E&#8208;ring were assembled by iterative use of a six&#8208;step reaction sequence in which RCM was used for ring construction and Tsuji&#8208;Trost allylation was employed for subsequent stereoselective functionalization.

         <title>Dioxygen Activation and Reduction by a Soluble Iron Phthalocyanine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iron ions in a square&#8208;planar coordination can bind molecules at the vacant axial positions and are able to transform them in stoichiometric and catalytic reactions. Nature takes advantage of these properties by incorporating iron into porphyrin systems, which play a key role not only in the binding and transport of oxygen, but also in catalytic oxidation and reduction reactions involving cytochrome P450. Although these systems have been studied extensively, there are still unresolved questions regarding the interplay between the iron ions and the surrounding ligands. Phthalocyanines (Pc) create a similar environment for metal atoms and FePc is known for a long time. However, without axial ligands FePc aggregates leading to solids of low solubility. In this work we used a known six&#8208;coordinate iron phthalocyanine derivative with bulky substituents and removed the stabilizing axial ligands. The resulting paramagnetic, four&#8208;coordinate compound does not aggregate and dissolves well so that NMR spectroscopy can be employed for studying the molecular structure and the reactivity. Solvent molecules bind weakly to the iron centers and oxygen is reduced in the presence of H&#8208;atom donors. The stoichiometric and catalytic reactivity with oxygen was studied in more detail.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Functional Isosorbide&#8208;Based Polyesters and Polyamides by Passerini Three&#8208;Component Polymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new family of functional isosorbide&#8208;based polyesters and polyamides with high glass transition temperature are prepared via Passerini&#8208;three component polymerization (P&#8208;3CP). To optimize the P&#8208;3CP conditions, the influence of the polymerization solvent, temperature, feed ratio on the molar mass of final polymers are investigated. The higher molar mass (up to 10100 g/mol) and yield (&gt;70%) are achieved under mild conditions (30 &#176;C, standard atmosphere). Functional side groups, such as alkenyl, alkynyl and methyl ester, were introduced into polymer structure via P&#8208;3CP by using functional isocyanides. The obtained polyesters and polyamides are characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and infrared (IR) spectroscopies, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). All polymers are thermal stable and amorphous with variable glass transition temperatures (Tg). The obtained polyester has Tg up to 87.5 &#176;C, while the Tg of polyamides (ISPA&#8208;2) is detected to be 97.5 &#176;C depending on the amide bonds in the polymer backbone and the benzene ring side groups. The cytotoxicity is investigated by the CCK&#8208;8 assay against mBMSC cells to confirm the biological safety. Overall, this novel strategy provides an efficient approach to produce functional isosorbide&#8208;based polyesters and polyamides, which are promising prospect for being applied to biodegradable materials.</dc:description>

         <title>New protocol for the synthesis of S&#8208;thioesters from benzylic, allylic and tertiary alcohols with thioacetic acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new one&#8208;pot solvent&#8208;less reaction to convert benzylic, allylic, ferrocenyl or tertiary alcohols into S&#8208;thioesters, bench&#8208;stable and less odorous precursors of the corresponding thiols, which is based on reactions in neat thioacetic acid in the presence of tetrafluoroboric acid, is presented. Reaction monitoring by NMR and GC of the benzyl alcohol conversion indicated the intermediate formation of benzyl acetate and benzyl thionoacetate (PhCH2OC(S)CH3) prior to the slower conversion to the final S&#8208;benzyl thioacetate product. Increasing the HBF4 concentration enhanced the reaction rate, giving good to excellent yield (up to 99%) for a large scope of alcohols. Control experiments, with support of DFT calculations, have revealed a thermodynamically favorable, though requiring HBF4&#8208;activation, disproportionation of CH3C(O)SH to CH3C(O)OH and CH3C(S)SH, the latter immediately decomposing to H2S and (MeC)4S6 but also generating the hitherto unreported [MeC(O)C(Me)S]2(&#181;&#8208;S)2. Kinetic investigations demonstrated that the rate of benzyl alcohol conversion is second&#8208;order in [PhCH2OH] and second order in [HBF4], while the rate of conversion of the benzyl acetate intermediate to S&#8208;benzyl thioacetate is second order in [PhCOOMe] and fourth order in [HBF4]. The DFT calculations rationalize the need to two alcohol molecules and two protons to generate the reactive benzyl cation.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyfluoroalkyl Chain&#8208;Based Assemblies for Biomimetic Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amphiphobic fluoroalkyl chains are exploited for creating robust and diverse self&#8208;assembled biomimetic catalysts in aqueous solution. Long terminal perfluoroalkyl chains (CnF2n+1 with n = 6, 8, and 10) yoked with a short perhydroalkyl chains (CmH2m with m = 2 and 3) were used to synthesize several 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane (TACN) derivatives, CnF2n+1&#8208;CmH2m&#8208;TACN. In the presence of an equimolar amount of Zn2+ ions that coordinate the TACN moiety and drive the self&#8208;assembly into micelle&#8208;like aggregates, the critical aggregation concentration of polyfluorinated CnF2n+1&#8208;CmH2mTACN&#183;Zn2+ was lowered by ~1 order of magnitude compared to the traditional perhyroalkyl counterpart with identical carbon number of alkyl chain. When 2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxypropyl&#8208;4&#8208;nitrophenyl phosphate was used as the model phosphate substrate, polyfluorinated CnF2n+1CmH2m&#8208;TACN&#183;Zn2+ assemblies showed higher affinity and catalytic activity, compared to its perhyroalkyl chain&#8208;based counterpart. Coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamic simulations have been introduced to explore the supramolecular assembly of polyfluoroalkyl chains in the presence of Zn2+ ions and to better understand their enhanced catalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;free Covalent organic frameworks for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the key reaction in metal air and fuel cells. Among the catalysts towards ORR, carbon&#8208;based metal&#8208;free catalysts are getting more attention because of their maximum atom utilization, effective active sites and satisfactory catalytic activity and stability. However, the pyrolysis synthesis of these carbons resulted in disordered porosities and uncontrolled catalytic sites, which hindered us to achieve the catalysts&#8217; properties previously, and build the structure&#8211;property relationship at molecular level. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) constructed with designable building blocks have been employed as metal free electrocatalysts towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) due to their controlled skeletons, tailored pores size and environments, and well&#8208;defined location and kinds of catalytic sites. In this concept article, the development of metal&#8208;free COFs for ORR is summarized, and different strategies including skeletons regulation, linkages engineering and edge&#8208;sites modulation to improve the catalytic selectivity and activity are discussed. Furthermore, this Concept provides prospective for design and construction high electrocatalysts based on the catalytic COFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimization of 3D synthetic scaffolds for neuronal tissue engineering applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The increasing prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases has spurred researchers to develop advanced 3D models that accurately mimic neural tissues. Hydrogels stand out as ideal candidates as their properties closely resemble those of the extracellular matrix. A critical challenge in this regard is to comprehend the influence of the scaffold's mechanical properties on cell growth and differentiation, thus enabling targeted modifications. In light of this, a synthesis and comprehensive analysis of acrylamide&#8208;based hydrogels incorporating a peptide has been conducted. Adequate cell adhesion and development is achieved due to their bioactive nature and specific interactions with cellular receptors. The integration of a precisely controlled physicochemical hydrogel matrix and inclusion of the arginine&#8208;glycine&#8208;aspartic acid peptide sequence has endowed this system with an optimal structure, thus providing a unique ability to interact effectively with biomolecules. The analysis fully examined essential properties governing cell behavior, including pore size, mechanical characteristics, and swelling ability. Cell&#8208;viability experiments were performed to assess the hydrogel&#8217;s biocompatibility, while the incorporation of grow factors aimed to promote the differentiation of neuroblastoma cells. The results underscore the hydrogel&#8217;s ability to stimulate cell viability and differentiation in the presence of the peptide within the matrix.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An exciting direction in metal&#8208;organic frameworks involves the design and synthesis of flexible structures which can reversibly adapt their structure when triggered by external stimuli. Controlling the extent and nature of response in such solids is critical in order to develop custom dynamic materials for advanced applications. Towards this, it is highly important to expand the diversity of existing flexible MOFs, generating novel materials and gain an in&#8208;depth understanding of the associated dynamic phenomena, eventually unlocking key structure&#8208;property relationships. In the present work, we successfully utilized reticular chemistry for the construction of two novel series of highly crystalline, flexible rare&#8208;earth MOFs, RE&#8208;thc&#8208;MOF&#8208;2 and RE&#8208;teb&#8208;MOF&#8208;1. Extensive single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal structural analyses coupled with detailed gas and vapor sorption studies, shed light onto the unique responsive behavior. The development of these series is related to the reported RE&#8208;thc&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 solids which were found to display a unique continuous breathing and gas&#8208;trapping property. The synthesis of RE&#8208;thc&#8208;MOF&#8208;2 and RE&#8208;teb&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 materials represents an important milestone as they provide important insights into the key factors that control the responsive properties of this fascinating family of flexible materials and demonstrates that it is possible to control their dynamic behavior and the associated gas and vapor sorption properties.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An exciting direction in metal-organic frameworks involves the design and synthesis of flexible structures which can reversibly adapt their structure when triggered by external stimuli. Controlling the extent and nature of response in such solids is critical in order to develop custom dynamic materials for advanced applications. Towards this, it is highly important to expand the diversity of existing flexible MOFs, generating novel materials and gain an in-depth understanding of the associated dynamic phenomena, eventually unlocking key structure-property relationships. In the present work, we successfully utilized reticular chemistry for the construction of two novel series of highly crystalline, flexible rare-earth MOFs, RE-thc-MOF-2 and RE-teb-MOF-1. Extensive single-crystal to single-crystal structural analyses coupled with detailed gas and vapor sorption studies, shed light onto the unique responsive behavior. The development of these series is related to the reported RE-thc-MOF-1 solids which were found to display a unique continuous breathing and gas-trapping property. The synthesis of RE-thc-MOF-2 and RE-teb-MOF-1 materials represents an important milestone as they provide important insights into the key factors that control the responsive properties of this fascinating family of flexible materials and demonstrates that it is possible to control their dynamic behavior and the associated gas and vapor sorption properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High Mannose Oligosaccharide Hemimimetics that Recapitulate the Conformation and Binding Mode to Concanavalin A, DC&#8208;SIGN and Langerin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The "carbohydrate chemical mimicry" exhibited by sp2&#8208;iminosugars has been utilized to develop practical syntheses for analogs of the branched high&#8208;mannose&#8208;type oligosaccharides (HMOs) Man3 and Man5. In these compounds, the terminal nonreducing Man residues have been substituted with 5,6&#8208;oxomethylydenemannonojirimycin (OMJ) motifs. The resulting oligomannoside hemimimetic accurately reproduce the structure, configuration, and conformational behavior of the original mannoligosaccharides, as confirmed by NMR and computational techniques. Binding studies with mannose binding lectins, including concanavalin A, DC&#8208;SIGN, and langerin, by enzyme&#8208;linked lectin assay and surface plasmon resonance revealed significant variations in their ability to accommodate the OMJ unit in the mannose binding site. Intriguingly, OMJMan segments demonstrated "in line" heteromultivalent effects during binding to the three lectins. Similar to the mannobiose (Man2) branches in HMOs, the binding modes involving the external or internal monosaccharide unit at the carbohydrate binding domain exist in equilibrium, facilitating sliding and recapture processes. This equilibrium, which influences the multivalent binding of HMOs, can be finely modulated upon incorporation of the OMJ sp2&#8208;iminosugar caps. As a proof of concept, the affinity and selectivity towards DC&#8208;SIGN and langerin were adjustable by presenting the OMJMan epitope in platforms with diverse architectures and valencies.</dc:description>
