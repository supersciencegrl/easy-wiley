         <title>High&#8208;Contrast Photoacoustic Imaging of Localized Cysteine in Orthotopic Breast Cancer Enabled by A Totally&#8208;Caged Methylene Blue Probe</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dedicated to the 90th anniversary of South China Normal University.It developed a methylene blue&#8208;based photoacoustic probe with NIR optical absorption totally caged, which could afford dramatical &#8220;OFF&#8208;to&#8208;ON&#8221; absorption transition for high&#8208;contrast photoacoustic sensing imaging (PASI) towards the localized cysteine. This work established an up&#8208;to&#8208;date strategy to originally eliminate the background photoacoustic signal for PASI to accurately monitor cysteine in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
High&#8208;contrast photoacoustic sensing imaging (PASI) was greatly determined by optical absorption changes of the absorbers usually enabled by activatable probes via controllably converting the absorbed electromagnetic energy to ultrasound waves. However, most of current photoacoustic probes still suffer from limited imaging contrast towards specific species because of their small absorption spectral changes in the near infrared (NIR) region. Herein, we developed a methylene blue&#8208;based photoacoustic probe with its NIR optical absorption totally caged, which could afford dramatical &#8220;OFF&#8208;to&#8208;ON&#8221; absorption transition for high&#8208;contrast photoacoustic imaging towards the localized cysteine. The rationally designed methylene blue&#8208;based probe for cysteine (MB&#8208;Cys) would keep in off state with almost no absorption in NIR region, while upon activated by cysteine through cyclization reaction with acrylates, it would reconstruct the &#960;&#8208;conjugation system to release the free methylene blue with strong absorption centered at 665&#8197;nm (&gt;130&#8208;fold enhancement). The unique responsive behavior could enable the PASI for photoacoustic mapping the cysteine in orthotopic breast cancer in a high&#8208;contrast manner. Therefore, this work established an up&#8208;to&#8208;date strategy to originally eliminate the background photoacoustic signal for PASI to accurately monitor cysteine in&#8197;vivo.

         <title>Phosphonium&#8208;substituted Diphosphaindenylide (PPI): Exploration of Biradical Character and Ligand Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a phosphonium&#8208;substituted diphosphaindenylide, PPI, is reported. Introduction of two P atoms to the indenyl core results in considerable biradical character. Moreover, the ligand properties of PPI are investigated using a chromium tricarbonyl complex as model compound.







Abstract
Starting from C6H4(PCl2)2 and the TMS&#8208;substituted ylide (TMS)2C=PR3 (TMS=trimethylsilyl, R=p&#8208;tolyl), the phosphonium&#8208;substituted diphosphaindenylide PPI was prepared in two steps. CASSCF calculations as well as the reactivity toward diphenyl acetylene suggest a notable biradical character in PPI. Reaction with [Cr(CO)3(MeCN)3] affords the complex [Cr(CO)3(&#951;5&#8208;PPI)] (5). This complex was employed to explore the ligand properties of PPI, which demonstrates considerable potential through the combination of strong metal&#8208;ligand interactions and the possibility of a pronounced indenyl effect.

         <title>One&#8208;pot Construction of Metal Nanoparticles Loaded COF Catalysts for Aqueous Hydrogenation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of metal nanoparticles loaded COFs catalysts have been prepared via one&#8208;pot construction strategy without lab&#8208;cost procedures, demonstrating excellent hydrogenation performance under mild conditions. The new strategy can be further evolved as into a versatile platform to create new COFs materials and explore the resultant applications.







Abstract
The catalysis performance of metal nanoparticles (NPs) will be significantly deteriorated because of their spontaneous agglomeration during practical applications. Covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs) materials with functional groups and well&#8208;defined channels benefit for the dispersion and anchor of metal ions and the confined growth of metal NPs, working as an ideal platform to compose catalytic systems. In this article, we report a one&#8208;pot strategy for the preparation of metal NPs loaded COFs without the need of post&#8208;modification. During the polymerization process, the pre&#8208;added metal ions were stabilized by the rapidly formed COF oligomers and hardly disturb the construction of COFs. After reduction, metal NPs are uniformly anchored on the COF matrix. Eventually, a wide spectrum of metal NPs, including Au, Pd, Pt, AuPd, CuPd, CuPt and CuPdPt, loaded COFs are successfully prepared. The versatility and metal ions anchoring mechanism are verified with four different COF matrixes. Taking AuPd NPs as example, the resultant AuPd NPs loaded COF materials can selectively decompose ammonium formate and produce hydrogen in&#8208;situ, exhibiting over 99&#8201;% conversion of hydrodechlorination for chlorobenzenes and nitro&#8208;reduction reaction for nitroaromatic compounds under ambient temperature in aqueous solution.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Synthesis of Peptidomimetics via Ugi Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the recent development for the construction of peptidomimetics via Ugi reactions or post&#8208;Ugi transformations. By the combination of Ugi reaction and transition metal catalysis such as gold, palladium, rhodium and copper, as well as metal&#8208;free strategies, devise linear, cyclic and polycyclic peptidomimetics are prepared in a rapid, highly efficient and step&#8208;economical manner.







Abstract
Peptidomimetics have been extensively explored in many area due to their ability to improve pharmacological qualities and interesting biological activities. Cycles could be incorporated in peptides to reduce their flexibility, often enhancing the affinity for a certain receptor. Many efforts have been made to synthesize various peptidomimetics. Among them, the Ugi reaction is a popular way for the synthesis of peptidomimetics because it provides peptide&#8208;like products. The Ugi reaction consists of the condensation of an aldehyde or ketone, a carboxylic acid, an amine, and an isocyanide usually giving a linear peptidomimetic. In order to obtain other linear, cyclic or polycyclic peptidomimetics, the acyclic products have to undergo additional transformations or cyclizations. This review covers the years from 2018&#8211;2023, regarding the synthesis of linear, cyclic and polycyclic peptidomimetics, employing Ugi reactions eventually followed by post&#8208;Ugi transformations. Organo&#8208;catalyzed reactions, base&#8208;promoted reactions, and metal&#8208;free reactions toward peptidomimetics are highlighted.

         <title>In vitro Production of Hemin&#8208;Based Artificial Metalloenzymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) is crucial to improve various industrial and biotechnological processes. In this study, we successfully designed a hemin&#8208;based ArM with peroxidase activity. Our results reveal improved properties compared to the activity of free hemin. Moreover, we also achieved the fabrication of this ArM in&#8197;vitro and in emulsio.







Abstract
Developing enzyme alternatives is pivotal to improving and enabling new processes in biotechnology and industry. Artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) are combinations of protein scaffolds with metal elements, such as metal nanoclusters or metal&#8208;containing molecules with specific catalytic properties, which can be customized. Here, we engineered an ArM based on the consensus tetratricopeptide repeat (CTPR) scaffold by introducing a unique histidine residue to coordinate the hemin cofactor. Our results show that this engineered system exhibits robust peroxidase&#8208;like catalytic activity driven by the hemin. The expression of the scaffold and subsequent coordination of hemin was achieved by recombinant expression in bulk and through in&#8197;vitro transcription and translation systems in water&#8208;in&#8208;oil drops. The ability to synthesize this system in emulsio paves the way to improve its properties by means of droplet microfluidic screenings, facilitating the exploration of the protein combinatorial space to discover improved or novel catalytic activities.

         <title>A New Series of Sandwich&#8208;Type 5,5&#8242;&#8208;Biterphenylenes: Synthetic Challenge, Structural Uniqueness and Photodynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly crowded biaryls, bi&#8208;linear&#8208;terphenylenes, contain several aryl/terphenylenyl/aryl sandwiches. This unique structure provides an ideal model for studying the through&#8208;space &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, which are strongly reflected in the shielding of 1H&#8201;NMR chemical shifts, properties and aromaticity.







Abstract
A new series of biaryls, bi&#8208;linear&#8208;terphenylenes (BLTPs), were prepared using the tert&#8208;butyllithium&#8208;mediated cyclization as the key synthetic step. The three&#8208;dimensional structures of the studied compounds were verified using X&#8208;ray crystallography and DFT calculations. Tetraaryl(ethynyl)&#8208;substituted BLTPs are highly crowded molecules, and the internal rotation around the central C&#8722;C bond is restricted due to a high barrier (&gt;50&#8197;kcal/mol). These structures contain several aryl/terphenylenyl/aryl sandwiches, where the through&#8208;space &#960;&#8208;&#960; (TSPP) interactions are strongly reflected in the shielding of 1H&#8201;NMR chemical shifts, reduction of oxidation potentials, increasing aromaticity of the central six&#8208;membered ring and decreasing antiaromaticity of the four&#8208;membered rings in a terphenylenyl moiety based on NICS(0) and iso&#8208;chemical shielding surfaces. Despite the restricted C&#8722;C bond associated intramolecular TSPP interactions for BLTPs in the ground state, to our surprise, the electronic coupling between two linear terphenylenes (LTPs) in BLTPs in the excited state is weak, so that the excited&#8208;state behavior is dominated by the corresponding monomeric LTPs. In other words, all BLTPs undergo ultrafast relaxation dynamics via strong exciton&#8208;vibration coupling, acting as a blue&#8208;light absorber with essentially no emission.

         <title>Hierarchically Porous Covalent Organic Frameworks: Synthesis Methods and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchically porous COFs (HP&#8208;COFs) refers to the integration of hierarchical pore distributions, which may include micropore, mesopore and macropore within one porous system. In this article, we introduce the synthesis methods of HP&#8208;COFs, encompassing topological structure design, in&#8208;situ templating, monolithic COF synthesis, defect engineering, and crystalline self&#8208;transformation. Simultaneously, we briefly introduce the applications of HP&#8208;COFs.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with high porosity have garnered considerable interest for various applications owing to their robust and customizable structure. However, conventional COFs are hindered by their narrow pore size, which poses limitations for applications such as heterogeneous catalysis and guest delivery that typically involve large molecules. The development of hierarchically porous COF (HP&#8208;COF), featuring a multi&#8208;scale aperture distribution, offers a promising solution by significantly enhancing the diffusion capacity and mass transfer for larger molecules. This review focuses on the recent advances in the synthesis strategies of HP&#8208;COF materials, including topological structure design, in&#8208;situ templating, monolithic COF synthesis, defect engineering, and crystalline self&#8208;transformation. The specific operational principles and affecting factors in the synthesis process are summarized and discussed, along with the applications of HP&#8208;COFs in heterogeneous catalysis, toxic component treatment, optoelectronics, and the biomedical field. Overall, this review builds a bridge to understand HP&#8208;COFs and provides guidance for further development of them on synthesis strategies and applications.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) exemplify up&#8208;and&#8208;coming crystalline porous materials characterized by spectacular specific surface areas, adjustable pore environments, and superb physicochemical stabilities. This Review highlights the enormous potential and recent advances of COFs for carbon dioxide trapping and water harvesting from air, in addition to highlighting the key challenges and future research directions.







Abstract
The implacable rise of carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in the atmosphere and acute water stress are one of the central challenges of our time. Present&#8208;day chemistry is strongly inclined towards more sustainable solutions. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), attributable to their structural designability with atomic precision, functionalizable chemical environment and robust extended architectures, have demonstrated promising performances in CO2 trapping and water harvesting from air. In this Review, we discuss the major developments in this field as well as sketch out the opportunities and shortcomings that remain over large&#8208;scale COF synthesis, device engineering, and long&#8208;term performance in real environments.

         <title>Chiral Supramolecular Organogel Constructed Using Riboflavin and Melamine: Its Application in Photo&#8208;Catalyzed Colorimetric Chiral Sensing and Enantioselective Adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of optically active riboflavin and melamine derivatives produces a chiral supramolecular organogel, which acts as a light&#8208;stimulated chiral sensor and a chiral adsorbent that enables colorimetric chiral discrimination and optical resolution.







Abstract
The synthesis of a chiral supramolecular organogel via the hierarchical helical self&#8208;assembly of optically active riboflavin and melamine derivatives is described herein. Owing to the photocatalysis of riboflavin and the supramolecular chirality induced in the helically stacked riboflavin/melamine complex, the gel is observed to act as a light&#8208;stimulated chiral sensor of optically active alcohols by detecting the change in color from yellow to green. The gel also served as an efficient chiral adsorbent, enabling optical resolution of a racemic compound with high chiral recognition ability.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Bola&#8208;Amphiphilic Porphyrin&#8208;Perylenebisimide Architectures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the synthetic approach and the characterization of a family of highly water&#8208;soluble porphyrin&#8208;PBI donor&#8208;acceptor amphiphiles by the utilization of oligo&#8208;carboxylic acid capped Newkome dendrons. The amphiphiles form stable aggregates in basic aqueous solutions. The amphiphiles can be individualized by the addition of THF, which manifests itself, for example, in the reinstatement of fluorescence emission.







Abstract
We report on the synthesis and characterization of a family of three water&#8208;soluble bola&#8208;amphiphilic zinc&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;perylenebisimide triads containing oligo carboxylic&#8208;acid capped Newkome dendrons in the periphery. Variations of the perylenebisimide (PBI) core geometry and dendron size (G1 and G2 dendrons with 3&#8208; and 9&#8208;carboxylic acid groups respectively) allow for tuning the supramolecular aggregation behavior with respect to variation of the molecular architecture. The triads show good solubility in basic aqueous media and aggregation to supramolecular assemblies. Theoretical investigations at the DFT level of theory accompanied by electrochemical measurements unravel the geometric and electronic structure of the amphiphiles. UV/Vis and fluorescence titrations with varying amounts of THF demonstrate disaggregation.

         <title>Cyclic Hydrocarbon Frameworks Containing Two Bismuth Atoms: Towards 9,10&#8208;Dibismaanthracene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of dinuclear bismuth heterocycles featuring the dihydro&#8208;dibismaanthrace structural motif are presented. These compounds involve bismuth halides, selenides, and heterobimetallic bismuth / transition&#8208;metal compounds with a versatile coordination chemistry. Synthetic access to the low&#8208;valent highly reactive dibismaanthracene (the so&#8208;called bismanthrene) has been probed and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based bismanthrene surrogates are suggested.







Abstract
When bismuth atoms are incorporated into cyclic organic systems, this commonly goes along with strained or distorted molecular geometries, which can be exploited to modulate the physical and chemical properties of these compounds. In six&#8208;membered heterocycles, bismuth atoms are often accompanied by oxygen, sulfur or nitrogen as a second hetero&#8208;element. In this work, we present the first examples of six&#8208;membered rings, in which two CH units are replaced by BiX moieties (X=Cl, Br, I), resulting in dihydro&#8208;anthracene analogs. Their behavior in chemically reversible reduction reactions is explored, aiming at the generation of dibisma&#8208;anthracene (bismanthrene). Heterometallic compounds (Bi/Fe, Bi/Mn) are introduced as potential bismanthrene surrogates, as supported by bismanthrene&#8208;transfer to selenium. Analytical techniques used to investigate the reported compounds include NMR spectroscopy, high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses, and DFT calculations.

         <title>Application of MXene&#8208;Based Materials for Cathode in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries have a high specific capacity and energy density to become the most promising high&#8208;energy storage system in the future. MXenes own metallic conductivity and strong polysulfides adsorption to overcome the drawbacks of low conductivity and the &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221; of Li&#8722;S batteries. This review summarizes different preparation methods and properties of MXenes and their cathode application in Li&#8722;S batteries.







Abstract
The lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries have a high theoretical specific capacity of 1675&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 and have become the most promising high&#8208;energy storage system for the next generation batteries technology. However, their applications are hindered by insulated feature and volume expansion of sulfur, as well as the &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221; of polysulfides. MXenes own metallic conductivity and strong ability of polysulfides adsorption. Besides, their unique two&#8208;dimensional (2D) structure, large specific surface area, abundant functional groups, and adjustability are beneficial to overcome the drawbacks of the sulfur cathode. In this review, different mainstream preparation methods and excellent properties of MXenes are summarized. Significant achievements and recent progress of MXene&#8208;based cathodes and interlayers applied to Li&#8722;S cathodes are concluded later. Finally, the challenges, possible solutions and potential applications of MXenes for Li&#8722;S batteries are also presented.

         <title>Ca(II) and Yb(II) complexes featuring M(C&#8801;C)4 structural motif: enforced proximity or genuine &#951;2&#8208;bonding?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#951;2&#8208;coordination of the alkyne triple C&#8801;C bond to Ca2+ and Yb2+ ions in the 1,8&#8208;bis(ethynyl)substituted carbazolide complexes is confirmed in the solid state by X&#8208;Ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy and in the solution by NMR spectroscopy. QTIAM analysis proves the existence of M(&#951;2&#8208;C&#8801;C) T&#8208;shaped bond pathways.







Abstract
Bis(carbazolide) complexes M[3,6&#8208;tBu2&#8208;1,8&#8208;(RC&#8801;C)2Carb]2(THF)n (R=SiMe3, n=0, M=Ca, Yb; R=Ph, n=1, M=Ca, Yb; n=0, M=Yb) were synthesized through transamination reaction of M[N(SiMe3)2]2(THF)2 with two molar equivalents of carbazoles. The complexes feature M(&#951;2&#8208;C&#8801;C)4 structural motif composed of M(II) ions encapsulated by four acetylene fragments due to atypical for alkaline&#8208; and rare&#8208;earth metals &#951;2&#8208;interactions with triple C&#8801;C bond. This interaction is evidenced experimentally by X&#8208;ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy in the solid state and by NMR&#8208;spectroscopy in the solution. According to QTAIM analysis there are 4 bond critical points (3;&#8722;1) between the metal atom and each of the triple bonds, which are connected by a strongly curved, almost T&#8208;shaped bond pathway.

         <title>Fluorescence color change of supramolecular polymer networks controlled by crown ether&#8208;cation recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorescent supramolecular polymer networks based on crown ether&#8208;cation recognition was fabricated. The host dimer M1 which exhibits blue fluorescence was prepared by decorating benzo[15]crown&#8208;5 with a quinoline group. M1 can crosslink the ammonium cations&#8208;grafted polymer P1 to form a supramolecular polymer networks through host&#8208;guest recognition, accompanied by the transformation of blue fluorescence into yellow fluorescence.







Abstract
We report a fluorescent supramolecular polymer networks (SPNs) system based on crown ether&#8208;cation recognition. The polymer side chains bear ammonium cations, which can be recognized by host molecules with a B15C5 unit and a quinoline group at each end. The quinoline group makes the host molecule exhibit blue fluorescence. After the formation of SPNs, the recognition of the crown ether&#8208;cation transforms the blue fluorescence into yellow fluorescence. The accompanying fluorescence color change during the formation of SPNs makes it with potential applications in the fields of display, printing, information storage, and bioimaging.

Herein, a site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H alkylation of naphthoquinone with unactivated alkanes using Mn2(CO)10 as a catalyst under blue&#8208;light (457&#8197;nm) irradiation without any utilization of external base, oxidant, and pre&#8208;functionalization is described. Using the presented methodology, the high&#8208;value&#8208;added compound parvaquone (a commercially available drug for treating theileriosis) and its derivatives can be directly constructed under ambient reaction conditions.







Abstract
Site&#8208;selective C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization of unreactive hydrocarbons is always challenging due to its inherited chemical inertness, slightly different reactivity of various C&#8722;H bonds, and intrinsically high bond dissociation energies. Here, a site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H alkylation of naphthoquinone with unactivated hydrocarbons using Mn2(CO)10 as a catalyst under blue&#8208;light (457&#8197;nm) irradiation without any external acid or base and pre&#8208;functionalization is presented. The selective C&#8722;H functionalization of tertiary over secondary and secondary over primary C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in abundant chemical feedstocks was achieved, and hydroxylation of quinones was realized in&#8197;situ by employing the developed methodology. This protocol provides a new catalytic system for the direct construction of high&#8208;value&#8208;added compounds, namely, parvaquone (a commercially available drug used to treat theileriosis) and its derivatives under ambient reaction conditions. Moreover, this operationally simple protocol applies to various linear&#8208;, branched&#8208;, and cyclo&#8208;alkanes with high degrees of site selectivity under blue&#8208;light irradiated conditions and could provide rapid and straightforward access to versatile methodologies for upgrading feedstock chemicals. Mechanistic insight by radical trapping, radical scavenging, EPR, and other controlled experiments well corroborated with DFT studies suggest that the reaction proceeds by a radical pathway.

         <title>Synthesis and dark state EPR properties of PDI&#8208;trityl dyads and triads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chromophore&#8208;radical systems are promising structures for quantum information science experiments, due to the possibility of generating high&#8208;spin states with strong spin polarization upon light excitation. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis of a number of different perylene diimides covalently linked to trityl radicals and explore their dark state properties by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy.







Abstract
Covalently&#8208;linked chromophore&#8208;radical systems with their unique optical and magnetic properties are useful for applications in, e.&#8201;g., quantum information science. To expand the catalog of molecular systems, we synthesized and characterized six novel chromophore&#8211;radical and radical&#8208;chromophore&#8208;radical systems employing derivatives of perylene diimide (PDI) as the chromophore and trityl as the radical. The EPR properties of these compounds were evaluated in solution at cryogenic and room temperatures. In addition, the electron spin&#8208;spin coupling in the two bistrityl systems was investigated using DQC measurements. The presented results serve as a basis for further spectroscopic investigations under photoexcitation of the PDI core.

         <title>Two Allogons of an O2&#8208;activating Bis(disiloxido)ferrate(II) Accessible Selectively just by Variation of the Crystallization Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One allogon hardly ever comes alone but the bis(disiloxido)ferrate(II) presented here is a unique case where the selective crystallization of two individual allogons &#8211; one with a square planar and one with a distorted FeO2 core &#8211; has been reached. Theoretical investigations allowed for the rationalization of this phenomenon. Reaction with O2 proceeds within milliseconds as monitored by stopped&#8208;flow measurements.







Abstract
Deprotonation of O(iPr2SiOH)2 (iPrLH2) with LiOtBu followed by reaction with FeCl2 in THF led to the complex [iPrL2Fe][Li(THF)2]2, 2, which represents a structural and spectroscopic model of the &#945;&#8208;Fe sites of Fe/ZSM&#8208;5. Reaction with O2 in THF solution proceeds rather fast and is complete within 200&#8197;ms; an intermediate O2 adduct could not be identified by stopped&#8208;flow methods. Cooling blue solutions of 2 to &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C led to the growth of blue crystals of 2&#8901;THF, the analysis of which by XRD revealed a FeO4 core that is somewhat distorted from planarity towards a tetrahedral structure. By contrast, cooling such solutions to &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C led to pink crystals of an allogon featuring a perfectly square planar FeO4 entity. Hence, 2 represents a unique case where two different structural isomers (allogons) can be crystallized from the same solvent selectively, controlled by the temperature. DFT calculations were performed to understand this finding.

         <title>Macrocycle&#8208;Based Hierarchically Porous Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocycle&#8208;based hierarchically porous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks were summarized, including the macrocycle structures, the hierarchically porous structures of the HOFs, and the applications induced by the hierarchically porous structures.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are porous crystalline materials. The pores in HOFs are usually non&#8208;covalent extrinsic pores constructed through the formation of the framework. Supramolecular macrocycles with intrinsic pores in their structures are good candidates for constructing HOFs with intrinsic pores from the macrocycles themselves, thus leading to hierarchically porous structures. Combining the macrocycle and HOFs will endow these hierarchically porous materials with enhanced properties and special functionalities. This review summarizes recent advances in macrocycle&#8208;based HOFs, including the macrocycles used for constructing HOFs, the hierarchically porous structures of the HOFs, and the applications induced by the hierarchically HOFs porous structures. This review provides insights for future research on macrocycle&#8208;based hierarchically porous HOFs and the appropriate applications of the unique structures.

         <title>Characterization of the Ligand Properties of Donor&#8208;stabilized Pnictogenyltrielanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The syntheses and characterizations of alkyl&#8208;substituted compounds IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH2ER2 (E=P, As; R=alkyl) are presented. Together with other donor&#8208;stabilized pnictogenyltrielanes, these compounds were reacted with Ni(CO)4 and their ligand properties evaluated regarding the steric and electronic nature of this class of compounds. According to the corresponding Tolman Electronic Parameters, the compounds are significantly more electron&#8208;rich than regular phosphines and their steric and electronic demands can be modified easily.







Abstract
A general synthesis and the characterization of novel alkyl&#8208;substituted NHC&#8208;stabilized pnictogenylboranes NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH2ER2 (NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, E=P, As; R2=Me2, Ph2, tBuH, Cy2, (SiMe3)2) are reported. These compounds were reacted with Ni(CO)4 to the corresponding complexes of the type [(NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH2ER2)Ni(CO)3] to determine their donor strength by Tolman Electronic Parameters (TEPs) and their steric demand as ligands compared to classical phosphines, superbasic phosphines and other commonly applied donor systems. The results show that the NHC&#8208;stabilized pnictogenyltrielanes can be considered as being highly basic, while their steric influence depends strongly on the organic residues as well as the donor attached to the {BH2} moiety. Although weaker than commonly used superbasic phosphines, the donor strength of pnictogenyltrielanes in general can be classified as of similar strength as NHCs. The steric and electronic properties can easily be modified by alkyl substitution as evident from the TEP trends.

These compounds were reacted with Ni(CO)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to the corresponding complexes of the type [(NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ER&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)Ni(CO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] to determine their donor strength by Tolman Electronic Parameters (TEPs) and their steric demand as ligands compared to classical phosphines, superbasic phosphines and other commonly applied donor systems. The results show that the NHC-stabilized pnictogenyltrielanes can be considered as being highly basic, while their steric influence depends strongly on the organic residues as well as the donor attached to the {BH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;} moiety. Although weaker than commonly used superbasic phosphines, the donor strength of pnictogenyltrielanes in general can be classified as of similar strength as NHCs. The steric and electronic properties can easily be modified by alkyl substitution as evident from the TEP trends.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Double Four Ring Units&#8208;Containing Zeolites: Synthesis, Structural Modification and Catalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides an overview of three categories of d4r&#8208;containing zeolites: germanosilicates, silicates, and aluminosilicates. A new classification rule, based on the difference in the connection modes between the d4r units and Si&#8208;rich frameworks, is carried out on these structurally specific zeolites. Various synthetic approaches are discussed and compared for developing novel germanosilicates, inducing structural transformation and stabilizing the frameworks.







Abstract
In zeolite frameworks, double four&#8208;ring (d4r) configurations are among the most frequent composite building units. The composition variations in d4r units greatly influence the energy and structural modifiability of the zeolitic framework. The introduction of germanium, with a larger ionic radius than silicon or aluminum, not only reduces the energy constraints of d4r in the nucleation and crystal growth of zeolites, but also opens a new window for constructing novel crystalline structures, especially with large or extra&#8208;large pores and channels. Ge&#8208;enriched d4r units endow germanosilicates with structure diversity readily for post treatments. Promising catalytic materials have been gradually developed and increasingly studied by direct synthesis or post&#8208;synthetic isomorphous substitution for Ge. This review focuses on the recent progress in the synthesis, modification, and catalytic application of d4r&#8208;containing zeolites, including germanosilicates, aluminosilicates, and silicates.

A metal&#8208;free protocol for the regio&#8208; and stereoselective thioarylation at the C3 position of 6&#8208;amino&#8208;2,3,6&#8208;trideoxy&#8208;d&#8208;manno&#8208;oct&#8208;2&#8208;ulosonic acid (iminoKdo) is presented. The transformation of these derivatives into 3,6&#8208;disubstituted picolinates was achieved through an acid&#8208;driven deprotection/aromatization sequence. Experimental studies and NMR analyses were employed to elucidate the reaction mechanism.







Abstract
In this work, we present a metal&#8208;free coupling protocol for the regio&#8208; and stereoselective C3&#8208;thioarylation of 6&#8208;amino&#8208;2,3,6&#8208;trideoxy&#8208;d&#8208;manno&#8208;oct&#8208;2&#8208;ulosonic acid (iminoKdo). The developed procedure enables the coupling of electron&#8208;rich, electron&#8208;deficient, and hindered arylthiols, providing a series of C3&#8208;modified iminoKdo derivatives in moderate to good yields. Elucidation of active species through controlled experimental studies and time&#8208;lapse 31P NMR analysis provides insights into the reaction mechanism. We demonstrate that, following a tandem Staudinger/aza&#8208;Wittig reaction of an azido&#8208;containing keto ester, an inseparable equimolar mixture of imine/enamine is formed. The enamine then undergoes a Stork&#8208;like nucleophilic attack with the in&#8197;situ&#8208;formed disulfide reagent, resulting in the formation of the coupling products. Additionally, we describe a rarely reported acid&#8208;promoted aromatization of the C3&#8208;thioarylated iminoKdo skeleton into 3,6&#8208;disubstituted picolinates, which are reminiscent of dichotomines.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Mediated Amination of Pyrogallol&#8208;Based Polyphenols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amyloids are known to be modified by natural polyphenols via amination. This study investigates the oxidative coupling mechanisms between polyphenols and N&#8208;nucleophiles, using in&#8197;vitro and in silico approaches. It is shown that polyphenols with a pyrogallol substructure and an electron&#8208;withdrawing group at the C4a&#8208;position are most effective. These insights can play a crucial role in drug design against amyloidogenesis.







Abstract
Flavonoids are known to covalently modify amyloidogenic peptides by amination reactions. The underlying coupling process between polyphenols and N&#8208;nucleophiles is assessed by several in&#8197;vitro and in silico approaches. The coupling reaction involves a sequence of oxidative dearomatization, amination, and reductive amination (ODARA) reaction steps. The C6&#8208;regioselectivity of the product is confirmed by crystallographic analysis. Under aqueous conditions, the reaction of baicalein with lysine derivatives yields C&#8722;N coupling as well as hydrolysis products of transient imine intermediates. The observed C&#8722;N coupling reactions work best for flavonoids combining a pyrogallol substructure with an electron&#8208;withdrawing group attached to the C4a&#8208;position. Thermodynamic properties such as bond dissociation energies also highlight the key role of pyrogallol units for the antioxidant ability. Combining the computed electronic properties and in&#8197;vitro antioxidant assays suggests that the studied pyrogallol&#8208;containing flavonoids act by various radical&#8208;scavenging mechanisms working in synergy. Multivariate analysis indicates that a small number of descriptors for transient intermediates of the ODARA process generates a model with excellent performance (r=0.93) for the prediction of cross&#8208;coupling yields. The same model has been employed to predict novel antioxidant flavonoid&#8208;based molecules as potential covalent inhibitors, opening a new avenue to the design of therapeutically relevant anti&#8208;amyloid compounds.

         <title>Carbonylation as a Key Step in New Tandem Reactions &#8211; A Route to BODIPYs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a highly efficient five&#8208;step reaction sequence for BODIPYs is presented. The synthesis of 55 derivatives with overall yields of up to 78&#8201;% showed that we were able to expand the range of readily accessible BODIPYs while demonstrating the general applicability and advantages of our developed method.







Abstract
Herein, a highly efficient five&#8208;step reaction sequence to BODIPYs is presented. The key step is the combination of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed in&#8208;situ generation of aldehydes and their subsequent organocatalytic activation to yield dipyrromethanes, which are further converted to the corresponding BODIPY. Classic syntheses towards BODIPYs have relied on aldehydes or acid chlorides, which are often not commercially available and rather sensitive to handle. The presented approach starts from readily available and stable alkenes or aryl&#8208;bromides, which allows to extend the range of readily available BODIPYs that can be tailored for their specific use. The synthesis of 55 derivatives with overall yields of up to 78&#8201;% demonstrates the wide applicability and advantages of the presented method.

A thermally stable, T&#8208;shaped, nickel(I) radical was straightforward obtained by reduction of a tridentate nacnac nickel(II) chloride with KSi(TMS)3. The metalloradical character of the compound was demonstrated by the formation of a highly unusual nickeloxaziridine complex upon addition of TEMPO. The Ni(I) species displays a rich chemistry towards activation S&#8722;S, and Se&#8722;Se bond leading to unusual C&#8722;C coupled product as well as dihydrogen activation at room temperature and atmospheric pressure to generate monomeric nickel hydride.







Abstract
The reaction of a nickel(II) chloride complex containing a tridentate &#946;&#8208;diketiminato ligand with a picolyl group [2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3NC(Me)CHC(Me)NH(CH2py)]Ni(II)Cl (1)] with KSi(SiMe3)3 conveniently afforded a nickel(I) radical with a T&#8208;shaped geometry (2). The compound&#8216;s metalloradical nature was confirmed through electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies and its reaction with TEMPO, resulting in the formation of a highly unusual three&#8208;membered nickeloxaziridine complex (3). When reacted with disulfide and diselenide, the S&#8722;S and Se&#8722;Se bonds were cleaved, and a coupled product was formed through carbon atom of the pyridine&#8208;imine group. The nickel(I) radical activates dihydrogen at room temperature and atmospheric pressure to give the monomeric nickel hydride.

         <title>Structurally Diverse Pyrene&#8208;decorated Planar Chiral [2,2]Paracyclophanes with Tunable Circularly Polarized Luminescence between Monomer and Excimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Various pyrene&#8208;based [2,2]PCP derivatives can be constructed by different substitution modes and connection patterns of [2,2]PCP cores and pyrene units. Diverse structures of these compounds lead to distinctive optical properties.







Abstract
We reported the synthesis of a series of structurally diverse CPL&#8208;active molecules, in which pyrene units were installed to chiral pm/po&#8208;[2,2]PCP scaffolds either with or without a triple bond spacer for pm/po&#8208;PCP&#8208;P1 and pm/po&#8208;PCP&#8208;P2, respectively. The X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses revealed that these pyrene&#8208;based [2,2]PCP derivatives exhibited diverse structures and crystal packings in the solid phases. The pyrene&#8208;based [2,2]PCP derivatives exhibit various (chir)optical properties in organic solutions, depending on their respective structures. In a mixture of dioxane and water, pm/po&#8208;PCP&#8208;P1 emit green excimer fluorescence, whereas pm/po&#8208;PCP&#8208;P2 emit blue one. The chiroptical investigation demonstrated that Rp&#8208;pm&#8208;PCP&#8208;P1 and Rp&#8208;pm&#8208;PCP&#8208;P2 exhibited completely opposite CD and CPL signals even they possess the same chiral Rp&#8208;[2,2]PCP core. The same argument also holds for other chiral pyrene&#8208;based [2,2]PCP derivatives. The theoretical calculation revealed that these unusual phenomena were attributed to different orientation between transition electric dipole moments and the magnetic dipole moments originating from the presence or absence of a triple bond spacer. These pyrene&#8208;based [2,2]PCP derivatives display various colours and fluorescence emissions in the solid state and PMMA films, possibly due to the different packings as observed in the crystal structure. Moreover, these compounds also can interact with perylene diimide through &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, leading to near&#8208;white fluorescence.

         <title>Carbon Dots based Tissue Equivalent Dosimeter as an Ionizing Radiation Sensor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study describes the synthesis and characterization of carbon dots. These nanomaterials can be used as fluorescent sensors. Introduced in the Fricke solution, they detect ionizing radiation by oxidizing Fe2+ ions to Fe3+ ions. It has high sensitivity to gamma radiation, useful as a tissue&#8208;equivalent dosimeter. Tested as radiation sensors, they showed two regions of linear response.







Abstract
This work explores the potential of carbon dots as a fluorescent probe in the determination of heavy ions and as an electrochemical biosensor. It also discusses how carbon dots can be introduced into the Fricke solution to potentially serve as an ionizing radiation sensor. The study presents a novel tissue equivalent dosimeter carbon dots&#8208;based as an ionizing radiation sensor. The methodology for the synthesis of Nitrogen&#8208;doped Carbon Dots N&#8208;CDs and the characterization of the material are described. The results show that the N&#8208;CDs have a high sensitivity to ionizing radiation and can be used as a dosimeter for radiation detection. The study also discusses the limitations and challenges of using carbon dots as a dosimeter for ionizing radiation. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the potential applications of carbon dots in different fields and highlights the importance of further research in this area.

         <title>&#947;&#8208;Cyclodextrins as Supramolecular Reactors for the Three&#8208;component Aza&#8208;Darzens Reaction in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work aims to study the aza&#8208;Darzens reaction using water as a solvent in a nanoconfined environment. This study was carried out on four different gamma&#8208;cyclodextrin systems to evaluate the reaction yield and the cis/trans ratio of the aziridines obtained. In addition, the reaction mechanism was studied using molecular dynamics and the support of mass spectrometry and DOSY experiments.







Abstract
In recent decades, many efforts have been devoted to studying reactions catalyzed in nanoconfined spaces. The most impressive aspect of catalysis in nanoconfined spaces is that the reactivity of the molecules can be smartly driven to disobey classical behavior. A green and efficient three&#8208;component aza&#8208;Darzens (TCAD) reaction using a catalytic amount of &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrins (CDs) in water has been developed to synthesize N&#8208;phenylaziridines. CDs effectively performed this reaction in an environmentally friendly setting, achieving good yields. The same reaction was then performed using polymeric &#947;&#8208;CD such as a &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin polymer crosslinked (GCDPC) with epichlorohydrin, a sponge&#8208;like macroporous &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;based cryogel (GCDC), and a &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;based hydrogel (GCDH). The homogeneous and heterogeneous catalyst recovery was then studied, and it was proved to be easily recycled several times without relevant activity loss. Water, as a unique and eco&#8208;friendly reaction medium, has been utilized for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, in this reaction. The inclusion of the reagents in CDs has been studied and rationalized by NMR spectroscopy experiments and molecular modeling calculations. The credit of the presented protocol includes good yields and catalyst reusability and precludes the use of organic solvents.

         <title>Recent Progress in Synthesis and Application of Chiral Organoselenium Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral organoselenium compounds have been widely used in the fields of organic catalysis, medicine, and materials due to their unique structural characteristics and reactivities. In this review, the synthesis of chiral selenides in recent decades and their applications in catalysis, medicine, and materials are summarized.







Abstract
Chiral organoselenium compounds have shown an important role as intermediates in many areas, such as drug discovery, organic catalysis, and nanomaterials. A lot of different methods have been developed to synthesize chiral compounds which contain selenium, because they have interesting properties and can be used in real life. Over the last few decades, a lot of progress has been made in synthesizing chiral organoselenium compounds. This work gives an overview of the progress made in creating new ways to synthesize chiral organoselenium compounds by categorizing them into groups based on the reactions they undergo. In addition, the use of chiral organoselenium compounds is also discussed.

Abstract
Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) derivatives have attracted significant recent interest in drug discovery as alkyne, tert&#8208;butyl and arene bioisosteres, where their incorporation is frequently associated with increased compound solubility and metabolic stability. While strategies for functionalisation of the bridgehead (1,3) positions are extensively developed, platforms allowing divergent substitution at the bridge (2,4,5) positions remain limited. Recent reports have introduced 1&#8208;electron strategies for arylation and incorporation of a small range of other substituents, but are limited in terms of scope, yields or practical complexity. Herein, we show the synthesis of diverse 1,2,3&#8208;trifunctionalised BCPs through lithium&#8208;halogen exchange of a readily accessible BCP bromide. When coupled with medicinally relevant product derivatisations, our developed 2&#8208;electron &#8220;late stage&#8221; approach provides rapid and straightforward access to unprecedented BCP structural diversity (&gt;20&#8197;hitherto&#8208;unknown motifs reported). Additionally, we describe a method for the synthesis of enantioenriched &#8220;chiral&#8208;at&#8208;BCP&#8221; bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes through a novel stereoselective bridgehead desymmetrisation.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Preparation of Sulfones Using Bis&#8208;Piperidine Sulfur Dioxide &#8211; An Underutilized Reagent for SO2 Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoredox&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot sulfone preparation is reported from alkyl bromides activated by silane&#8208;mediated halogen atom transfer. In the process, a previously unutilized SO2 adduct bis(piperidine) sulfur dioxide &#8211; or PIPSO &#8211; was found to be the best source of SO2 for radical capture under the reaction conditions. Alkyl and aryl sulfones were prepared as well as sulfonylated APIs.







Abstract
Sulfonyl groups are widely observed in biologically relevant molecules and consequently, SO2 capture is an increasingly attractive method to prepare these sulfonyl&#8208;containing compounds given the range of SO2&#8208;surrogates now available as alternatives to using the neat gas. This, along with the advent of photoredox catalysis, has enabled mild radical capture of SO2 to emerge as an effective route to sulfonyl compounds. Here we report a photoredox&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile sulfonylation of aryl and alkyl bromides making use of a previously under&#8208;used amine&#8208;SO2 surrogate; bis(piperidine) sulfur dioxide (PIPSO). A broad selection of alkyl and aryl bromides were photocatalytically converted to their corresponding sulfinates and then trapped with various electrophiles in a one&#8208;pot multistep procedure to prepare sulfones and sulfonamides.

         <title>Spin qubits of Cu(II) doped in Zn(II) metal&#8211;organic frameworks above microsecond phase memory time</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the occurrence of both magnetic relaxation and spin coherence on single&#8208;ion Cu(II) centers in the three&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) having phase memory time above microsecond. It provides a new platform for the application of MOFs as spin quantum materials having fine&#8208;tuning ability.







Abstract
With the aim of creating Cu(II) spin qubits in a rigid metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), this work demonstrates a doping of 5&#8201;%, 2&#8201;%, 1&#8201;%, and 0.1&#8201;% mol of Cu(II) ions into a perovskite&#8208;type MOF [CH6N3][ZnII(HCOO)3]. The presence of dopant Cu(II) sites are confirmed with anisotropic g&#8208;factors (gx=2.07, gy=2.12, and gz=2.44) in the S=1/2 system by experimentally and theoretically. Magnetic dynamics indicate the occurrence of a slow magnetic relaxation via the direct and Raman processes under an applied field, with a relaxation time (&#964;) of 3.5&#8197;ms (5&#8201;% Cu), 9.2&#8197;ms (2&#8201;% Cu), and 15&#8197;ms (1&#8201;% Cu) at 1.8&#8197;K. Furthermore, pulse&#8208;ESR spectroscopy reveals spin qubit properties with a spin&#8208;spin relaxation (phase memory) time (T2) of 0.21&#8197;&#956;s (2&#8201;%Cu), 0.39&#8197;&#956;s (1&#8201;%Cu), and 3.0&#8197;&#956;s (0.1&#8201;%Cu) at 10&#8197;K as well as Rabi oscillation between MS=&#177;1/2 spin sublevels. T2 above microsecond is achieved for the first time in the Cu(II)&#8208;doped MOFs. It can be observed at submicrosecond around 50&#8197;K. These spin relaxations are very sensitive to the magnetic dipole interactions relating with cross&#8208;relaxation between the Cu(II) sites and can be tuned by adjusting the dopant concentration.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Catalyzed Dearomative Skeletal Editing of Indazoles by Donor Carbene Insertion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given the prevalence of heterocyclic scaffolds in drug&#8208;related molecules, converting these highly modular heterocyclic scaffolds into structural diversified and dearomatized analogs is an ideal strategy for improving their physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties. Here, we describe an efficient method for silver carbene mediated dearomative N&#8211;N bond cleavage leading to skeletal hopping between indazole and 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinazoline via a highly selective single&#8208;carbon insertion procedure. Using this methodology, a series of dihydroquinazoline analogues with diarylmethylene&#8208;substituted quaternary carbon centers were constructed with excellent yields and good functional group compatibility, which was further illustrated by the late&#8208;stage diversification of important pharmaceutically active ingredients. DFT calculations indicated that the silver catalyst not only induces the formation of the silver carbene, but also activates the diazahexatriene intermediate, which plays a crucial role in the formation of the C&#8211;N bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Interlocked and Non&#8208;Interlocked Deca(para&#8208;phenylene) Derivatives by Ni&#8208;mediated Biaryl Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oligo(para&#8208;phenylene) (PPn) is a compound composed of directly connected 1,4&#8208;phenylene moieties. The synthesis of PPn composed of six or more phenylene moieties with no substituent at the internal phenylene moiety has been challenging because of its low solubility. Herein we synthesized oligo(para&#8208;phenylene)[2]rotaxanes, including a deca(para&#8208;phenylene)[2]rotaxane, with a defined number of phenylene moieties. Biaryl coupling of iodoarenes mediated by macrocyclic dibenzodihydrophenanthroline&#8208;Ni complex was utilized for the first time to synthesize the [2]rotaxanes. Compared to the non&#8208;interlocked deca(para&#8208;phenylene), the deca(para&#8208;phenylene)[2]rotaxane showed higher solubility. The properties of the oligo(para&#8208;phenylene)[2]rotaxanes and non&#8208;interlocked oligo(para&#8208;phenylene)s were analyzed by spectroscopic methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis with Organoselenium Compounds &#8211; The Past Twelve Years</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The discovery and synthetic applications of novel organoselenium compounds and their reactions proceeded rapidly during the past fifty years and such processes are now carried out routinely in many laboratories. At the same time, the growing demand for new enantioselective processes provided new challenges. The convergence of selenium chemistry and asymmetric synthesis led to key developments in the 1970s, although the majority of early work was based on stoichiometric processes. More recently, greater emphasis has been placed on greener catalytic variations, along with the discovery of novel reactions and a deeper understanding of their mechanisms. The present review covers the literature in this field from 2010 to early 2023 and encompasses asymmetric reactions mediated by chiral selenium&#8208;based reagents, auxiliaries and, especially, catalysts. Protocols based on achiral selenium compounds in conjunction with other species of chiral catalysts, as well as reactions that are controlled by chiral substrates, are also included.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Puffing with Large Volume Expansion and Photomechanical Motions induced by Topochemical [4+4] Reactions in Molecular Crystal Solvates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we report the first example of two crystal solvates of an anthracene&#8208;benzhydrazide based molecule (Ant) that display very distinct photo&#8208;responsive behaviour when 365 or 405 nm or visible light is illuminated. For the first time, the crystal hydrate that has water molecule in the lattice (hereafter named as Ant&#8208;H2O) display fascinating puffing behavior with large volume expansion and surface modulation when illuminated with 405 nm light, a phenomenon very much similar to the rice or popcorn puffing by thermal treatment. Utilizing the properties of photoconverted Ant&#8208;H2O crystals, we have demonstrated their application in photoinduced enhanced liquid absorption using various liquids/solutions.The other crystal solvate having DMF in the crystal lattice (hereafter named as Ant&#8208;DMF) responds to 405 nm light by bending, twisting, chopping, jumping or splitting etc. The chopping of Ant&#8208;DMF crystal was also observed under ambient / white light but at a slower rate compared to 405 nm light. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction study reveals that the photoinduced puffing and photomechanical effects of these materials are rooted to the topochemical [4+4] cycloaddition reaction between the anthracene moieties that facilitate molecular packing change assisted by the reconfiguration of intermolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions involving lattice trapped solvent molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>An Interface&#8208;cascading Silicon Photoanode with Strengthened Built&#8208;in Electric Field and Enriched Surface Oxygen Vacancies for Efficient Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To promote interfacial charge transfer process and accelerate surface water oxidation reaction kinetics for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting over n&#8208;type Silicon (n&#8208;Si) based photoanodes, herein, starting with surface stabilized n&#8208;Si/CoOx, a NiOx/NiFeOOH composite overlayer was coated by atomic layer deposition and spray coating to fabricate the multilayer structured n&#8208;Si/CoOx/NiOx/NiFeOOH photoanode. Encouragingly, the obtained n&#8208;Si/CoOx/NiOx/NiFeOOH photoanode exhibits much increased PEC activity for water splitting, with onset potential cathodically shifted to ~0.96 V vs. RHE and photocurrent density increased to 22.6 mA cm&#8208;2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE for OER, as compared to n&#8208;Si/CoOx, even significantly surpassing the counterpart n&#8208;Si/CoOx/NiOx/FeOOH and n&#8208;Si/CoOx/NiOx/NiOOH photoanodes. Photophysical and electrochemical characterizations evidence that the deposited CoOx/NiOx/NiFeOOH composite overlayer would create large band bending and strong built&#8208;in electric field at the introduced cascading interfaces, thereby producing a large photovoltage of 650 mV to efficiently accelerate charge transfer from the n&#8208;Si substrate to the electrolyte for water oxidation. Furthermore, the surface oxygen vacancy enriched NiFeOOH overlayer could effectively catalyze the water oxidation reaction by thermodynamically reducing the energy barrier of rate determining step for OER.</dc:description>

         <title>Central Ring Puckering Enhances the Stokes Shift of Xanthene Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small&#8208;molecule dyes are generally designed based on well&#8208;understood electronic effects. However, steric hindrance can promote excited&#8208;state geometric relaxation, increasing the difference between the positions of absorption and emission bands (the Stokes shift). Accordingly, we hypothesized that sterically induced central ring puckering in xanthene dyes could be used to systematically increase their Stokes shift. Through a combined experimental/quantum&#8208;chemical approach, we screened a group of (9&#8208;acylimino)&#8208;pyronin dyes with a perturbed central ring geometry. Our results showed that an atom with sp3 hybridization in position 10 of (9&#8208;acylimino)&#8208;pyronins induces central ring puckering and facilitates excited&#8208;state geometric relaxation, thereby markedly enhancing their Stokes shifts (by up to ~2000 cm&#8722;1). Thus, we prepared fluorescent (9&#8208;acylimino)&#8208;pyronin pH sensors, which showed a Stokes shift disparity between acid and base forms of up to ~8700 cm&#8722;1. Moreover, the concept of ring puckering&#8208;enhanced Stokes shift can be applied to a wide range of xanthene analogues found in the literature. Therefore, central ring puckering may be reliably used as a strategy for enhancing Stokes shifts in the rational design of dyes.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic topological and supramolecular control of Diels&#8208;Alder reactivity based on a tunable self&#8208;complexing host&#8208;guest molecular switch</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining two biorelevant concepts, i.&#8201;e., compartmentalization and regulator&#8208;induced conformational change allows control of the Diels&#8208;Alder reactivity between a furan moiety and maleimide in water. Using a thermosensitive regulator enables the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction to be turned off at elevated temperature, whereas it is activated by lowering the temperature, representing a rare example of reduced reactivity at elevated temperature.







Abstract
Compartmentalization and binding&#8208;triggered conformational change regulate many metabolic processes in living matter. Here, we have synergistically combined these two biorelevant processes to tune the Diels&#8208;Alder (DA) reactivity of a synthetic self&#8208;complexing host&#8208;guest molecular switch CBPQT4+&#8208;Fu, consisting of an electron&#8208;rich furan unit covalently attached to the electron&#8208;deficient cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;p&#8208;phenylene) tetrachloride (CBPQT4+, 4Cl&#8722;) host. This design allows CBPQT4+&#8208;Fu to efficiently compartmentalize the furan ring inside its host cavity in water, thereby protecting it from the DA reaction with maleimide. Remarkably, the self&#8208;complexed CBPQT4+&#8208;Fu can undergo a conformational change through intramolecular decomplexation upon the addition of a stronger binding molecular naphthalene derivative as a competitive guest, triggering the DA reaction upon addition of a chemical regulator. Remarkably, connecting the guest to a thermoresponsive lower critical solution temperature (LCST) copolymer regulator controls the DA reaction on command upon heating and cooling the reaction media beyond and below the cloud point temperature of the copolymer, representing a rare example of decreased reactivity upon increasing temperature. Altogether, this work opens up new avenues towards combined topological and supramolecular control over reactivity in synthetic constructs, enabling control over reactivity through molecular regulators or even mild temperature variations.

         <title>Gold&#8208;promoted biocompatible selenium arylation of small molecules, peptides and proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A low pKa (5.2), high polarizable volume (3.8 &#197;), and proneness to oxidation under ambient conditions make selenocysteine (Sec, U) a unique, natural reactive handle present in most organisms across all domains of life. Sec modification still has untapped potential for site&#8208;selective protein modification and probing. Herein we demonstrate the use of a cyclometalated gold(III) compound, [Au(bnpy)Cl2], in the arylation of diselenides of biological significance, with a scope covering small molecule models, peptides, and proteins using a combination of multinuclear NMR (including 77Se NMR), and LC&#8208;MS. Diphenyl diselenide (Ph&#8208;Se)2 and selenocystine, (Sec)2, were used for reaction optimization. This approach allowed us to demonstrate that an excess of diselenide (Au/Se&#8208;Se) and an increasing water percentage in the reaction media enhance both the conversion and kinetics of the C&#8208;Se coupling reaction, a combination that makes the reaction biocompatible. The C&#8208;Se coupling reaction was also shown to happen for the diselenide analogue of the cyclic peptide vasopressin ((Se&#8208;Se)&#8208;AVP), and the Bos taurus glutathione peroxidase (GPx1) enzyme in ammonium acetate (2 mM, pH = 7.0). The reaction mechanism, studied by DFT revealed a redox&#8208;based mechanism where the C&#8208;Se coupling is enabled by the reductive elimination of the cyclometalated Au(III) species into Au(I).</dc:description>

         <title>Water&#8208;Based Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Sheet&#8208;Like Supramolecular Metallohydrogel Organized by Using a Native Ultrashort Peptide Sequence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
l&#8208;His&#8208;l&#8208;Ile&#8208;l&#8208;Thr (HIT), a short unmodified &#8220;native&#8221; tripeptide, reacts selectively with Cu2+ ions in pure water to form a transparent supramolecular metallohydrogel. This is a rare phenomenon in which a tripeptide forms a metallohydrogel without any protective group. HIT is transformed from a random coil&#8208;like structure to a &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;like structure by the Cu2+ ions, thereby forming a hydrogel.







Abstract
Designing supramolecular hydrogels using short peptides is challenging. To control self&#8208;assembly, a certain amount of organic solvent is typically added to the system, or the short peptide is modified with a functional group that is hydrophobic, hydrophilic, or highly coordinative. We discovered that l&#8208;His&#8208;l&#8208;Ile&#8208;l&#8208;Thr (HIT), a very short unmodified &#8220;native&#8221; tripeptide, selectively responds to Cu2+ ions in pure water to form a transparent supramolecular metallohydrogel. Circular dichroism analysis revealed that Cu2+ ions, but no other metal species, caused HIT to change from a random&#8208;coil&#8208;like to a &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;like structure. Other spectroscopic methods were used to characterize the properties of the supramolecular metallohydrogel. These results are expected to facilitate the development of native short peptides as advanced functional biomaterials.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free, Hindered, Regioselective Access to Multifunctional Groups Diarylamines via SNAr Substitution of P&#8208;Nitroso Aromatic Methyl Ether by Arylamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifunctional groups diarylamines efficiently produced from arylamines and p&#8208;nitrosoanisole derivatives by intermolecular SNAr under weak acid conditions. Relying on the catalysis of hydrogen protons, the SNAr reaction, which is endowed with resistance to space crowding, tolerance to halogen and nitroso groups, and high regioselectivity, can be carried out under mild conditions, even if the substrates involved do not have strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups.







Abstract
Multifunctional groups diarylamines, an innovative product, efficiently produced from arylamines and p&#8208;nitrosoanisole derivatives by intermolecular SNAr under weak acid conditions. This SNAr proceeds under mild reaction conditions, and more significantly, the substrates involved do not necessarily require strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. Moreover, this SNAr is characterized by resistance to space crowding, tolerance to halogen and nitroso functional groups, and high regioselectivity. Mechanistic observations suggest that the SNAr is the result of the transfer of the positive charge center of the protonated nitroso group to the p&#8208;methoxy group.

         <title>An Electrochemical Oxo&#8208;amination of 2H&#8208;Indazoles: Synthesis of Symmetrical and Unsymmetrical Indazolylindazolones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An environmentally benign supporting electrolyte&#8208;free oxo&#8208;amination of 2H&#8208;indazole has been developed for the synthesis of symmetrical indazolylindazolones via electrochemical reduction of aerial oxygen. Simultaneously, unsymmetrical coupling products were efficiently produced by cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling between indazolone and 2H&#8208;indazole derivatives through electrochemical C&#8722;N bond formation.







Abstract
We have established a supporting&#8208;electrolyte free electrochemical method for the synthesis of indazolylindazolones through oxygen reduction reaction (eORR) induced 1,3&#8208;oxo&#8208;amination of 2H&#8208;indazoles where 2H&#8208;indazole is used as both aminating agent as well as the precursor of indazolone. Moreover, we have merged indazolone and indazole to get unsymmetrical indazolylindazolones through direct electrochemical cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC). This exogenous metal&#8208;, oxidant&#8208; and catalyst&#8208;free protocol delivered a number of multi&#8208;functionalized products with high tolerance of diverse functional groups.

         <dc:description>Tuning the topology of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is of paramount scientific interest but remains largely unexplored. Herein, we present a site&#8208;selective synthetic strategy that enables the tuning of 2D COF topology by simply adjusting the molar ratio of an amine&#8208;functionalized dihydrazide monomer (NH2&#8208;Ah) and 4,4',4''&#8208;(1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triyl)tribenzaldehyde (Tz). This approach resulted in the formation of two distinct COFs: a clover&#8208;like 2D COF with free amine groups (NH2&#8208;Ah&#8208;Tz) and a honeycomb&#8208;like COF without amine groups (Ah&#8208;Tz). Both COFs exhibited good crystallinity and moderate porosity. Remarkably, the clover&#8208;shaped NH2&#8208;Ah&#8208;Tz COF, with abundant free amine groups, displayed significantly enhanced adsorption capacities toward crystal violet (CV, 261 mg/g) and congo red (CR, 1560 mg/g) compared to the nonfunctionalized honeycomb&#8208;like Ah&#8208;Tz COF (123 mg/g for CV and 1340 mg/g for CR), underscoring the pivotal role of free amine functional groups in enhancing adsorption capacities for organic dyes. This work highlights that the site&#8208;selective synthetic strategy paves a new avenue for manipulating 2D COF topology by adjusting the monomer feeding ratio, thereby modulating their adsorption performances toward organic dyes.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing the Features of DNA Mimic Foldamers for Structural Investigations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA mimic foldamers based on aromatic oligoamide helices bearing anionic phosphonate side chains have been shown to bind to DNA&#8208;binding proteins sometimes orders of magnitude better than DNA itself. Here, we introduce new features in the DNA mimic foldamers to facilitate structural investigations of their interactions with proteins. Thirteen new foldamer sequences have been synthesized and characterized using NMR, circular dichroism, molecular modeling, and X&#8208;ray crystallography. The results show that foldamer helix handedness can be quantitatively biased by means of a single stereogenic center, that the foldamer structure can be made C2&#8208;symmetrical as in palindromic B&#8208;DNA sequences, and that associations between foldamer helices can be promoted utilizing dedicated C&#8208;terminal residues that act as sticky ends in B&#8208;DNA structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Dual C&#8210;F Bond Activation of Hexafluorobenzene Mediated by Boron Atom</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of laser&#8208;ablated boron atoms with hexafluorobenzene (C6F6) was investigated in neon and argon matrices, and the products are identified by matrix&#8208;isolation infrared spectroscopy and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. The reaction is triggered by a boron atom insertion into one C&#8210;F bond of hexafluorobenzene on annealing, forming a fluoropentafluorophenyl boryl radical (A). UV&#8208;Vis light irradiation of the &#160;fluoropentafluorophenyl boryl radical causes generation of a 2&#8208;difluoroboryl&#8208;tetrafluorophenyl radical (B) via a second C&#8210;F bond activation. A perfluoroborepinyl radical (C) generated from the C&#8210;C bond insertion reaction is also observed upon deposition and under UV&#8208;Vis light irradiation. These findings reveal the first example of a double C&#8211;F bond activation of hexafluorobenzene mediated by a nonmetal and provides a possible route for synthesis of new perfluorinated organo&#8208;boron compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA&#8208;Targeted Complexes of Tc and Re for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress on DNA targeting Re/Tc complexes and their biomedical relevance, highlighting different types of homometallic and heterobimetallic complexes and different modes of DNA interactions. Future directions and contribution of DNA&#8208;targeted Re/Tc complexes for the development and success of anticancer agents and cancer theranostic radiopharmaceuticals are discussed.







Abstract
Due to their favorable chemical features, Re and Tc complexes have been widely used for the development of new therapeutic agents and imaging probes to solve problems of biomedical relevance. This review provides an update of the most relevant research efforts towards the development of novel cancer theranostic agents using Re and Tc&#8208;based compounds interacting with specific DNA structures. This includes a variety of homometallic complexes, namely those containing M(CO)3 (M=Re, Tc) moieties, that exhibit different modes of interaction with DNA, such as covalent binding, intercalation, groove binding or G&#8208;quadruplex DNA binding. Additionally, heterometallic complexes, designed to potentiate synergistic effects of different metal centers to improve DNA&#8208;targeting, cytotoxicity and fluorescence properties, are also reviewed. Particular attention is also given to 99mTc&#8208; and 188Re&#8208;labeled oligonucleotides that have been widely explored to develop imaging and therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals through the in&#8197;vivo hybridization with a specific complementary DNA or RNA target sequence to provide useful molecular tools in precision medicine for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Finally, the need for further improvement of DNA&#8208;targeted Re and Tc&#8208;based compounds as potential therapeutic and diagnostic agents is highlighted, and future directions are discussed.

         <title>Diindolocarbazole&#8208;based Rigid Donor&#8208;acceptor TADF Molecules for Energy and Electron Transfer Photocatalysis
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four twisted D&#8208;A TADF molecules based on diindolocarbazole and phenyl carbazole as donor and indoloquinoxalines as acceptor were synthesized, characterized and utilized for photocatalytic E&#8722;Z isomerization of stilbene and C&#8722;H arylation of heteroarenes.







Abstract
The design and synthesis of four twisted donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules CBZ&#8208;IQ, CBZ&#8208;2FIQ, DI&#8208;IQ and DI&#8208;2FIQ is reported in this work based on diindolocarbazole (DI) and phenyl carbazole as donor and indoloquinoxalines as acceptor. These compounds serve as photocatalysts for organic transformations. Theoretical calculations and experimental data showed reasonable singlet and triplet energy gaps of 0.17&#8208;0.26&#8197;eV for all compounds. All molecules showed increase in fluorescence quantum yields after degassing the solution and the transient photoluminescence decay showed two components: shorter prompt components (11.4&#8197;ns to 31&#8197;ns) and longer delayed components (36.4&#8197;ns to 1.5 &#956;s) which further indicate the occurrence of TADF process. Cyclic voltammetry studies indicated well&#8208;suited excited state redox potentials of all compounds to catalyze organic transformations such as heteroarene arylation. Accordingly, photocatalytic C&#8722;H arylation of heteroarenes were performed using these compounds with excellent isolated yields of upto 80&#8201;%. Due to their suitable efficient triplet energy levels, all the emitters were also employed as energy transfer photocatalysts in E to Z isomerization of stilbene with the excellent conversion of ~90&#8201;%.

         <title>Template Assisted Formation of 32&#8201;and 34&#960; Octaphyrins Embedded with Dithienopyrrole Cores: A New Scaffold to Unravel Proton Coupled Redox Switching and (Anti)Aromaticity</title>

The fourfold meso&#8208;substituted 32&#960; antiaromatic octaphyrin 1 embedded with dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;d]pyrrole undergoes facile proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) to its 34&#960; aromatic congener H21&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H+. Such a conversion was effective even in the presence of weak acids as well as small organic molecules like alcohols and amines. The stable aromatic freebase H21 exhibits near&#8208;planar conformation with colorimetric sensing for fluoride and hydroxide anions.







Abstract
Herein, we report two distinct octaphyrins obtained by the condensation of new dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;d]pyrrole based tetrapyrrane under two different acidic conditions. Fourfold meso&#8208;substituted octaphyrin was the major product when the reaction was performed in the presence of an aryl aldehyde using trifluoroacetic acid. Whereas, the sixfold meso&#8208;substituted octaphyrin was obtained when the precursor was condensed with pentafluorobenzaldehyde using para&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid. Such a template effect of aryl aldehydes in oxidative coupling reactions is realized for the first time in literature. Experimental and theoretical studies suggested that the oxidized form of fourfold meso&#8208;substituted octaphyrin is 32&#960; antiaromatic and undergoes proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) to the protonated form of 34&#960; aromatic congener upon treatment with protic acids. Furthermore, small organic molecules such as alcohols and amines were also found to promote chemical reduction. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structure revealed that the aromatic counterpart is highly planar and stabilized by several intermolecular H&#8208;bonding and F&#8722;F interactions, leading to a large 3D supramolecular arrangement and exhibited colorimetric sensing for fluoride and hydroxide anions. On the other hand, sixfold meso&#8208;substituted octaphyrin did not show (anti)aromatic features, PCET or anion sensing, but its intriguing absorption features associated with protonation could make it an ideal candidate for pH&#8208;dependent bioimaging.

Actuate Acyl Azolium and Acetone with violet Aurora!! The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free photoinduced methodology is highly desirable to access thermodynamically less favoured (Z)&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. We demonstrate that acetone acts as a reactant as well as a solvent, acyl azolium salt acts as an aroyl surrogate, and the triplet state of acyl azolium promotes intermolecular hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) from acetone under violet LED irradiation. This mild and environmentally friendly protocol does not require any metals, ligands, or oxidants.







Abstract
Mono &#945;&#8208;acylation of acetone has been achieved for the first time by reacting with bench&#8208;stable acyl azolium salts under violet&#8208;LED light at room temperature. The intermolecular hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) from acetone to triplet state of azolium salts under violet LED irradiation resulted in thermodynamically less favourable (Z)&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones with up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 selectivity via C&#8722;C bond formation. This compelling protocol access the desired &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H acylation product under metal&#8208;, ligand&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free conditions on a wide range of substrates.

Heavy group 14&#8208;15&#8201;compounds: Various low&#8208;valent group 14&#8211;15 compounds of the type [(Dipp2NacNac)ME(SiMe3)2] (M=Ge&#8722;Pb, E=As&#8722;Bi) were obtained by salt elimination reactions. The focus of these investigations is on the heavy representatives of both groups, on the structures and the reactivity.







Abstract
A series of low&#8208;valent Group 14&#8211;15 compounds were obtained starting from [(Dipp2NacNac)MCl] (M=Ge&#8208;Pb) (I&#8211;III) (Dipp2NacNac=HC{C(Me)N(Dipp)}2) and M'E(SiMe3)2 (M&#8217;=Li, E=As; M&#8217;=K, E=Sb, Bi) (IV&#8211;VI). In the course of this investigations we were able to fully characterize all permutations except Pb&#8722;Bi for compounds of the composition [(Dipp2NacNac)ME(SiMe3)2] (1E: M=Ge, 2E: M=Sn, 3E: M=Pb). Thus, we report the first low valent tetrelene with Sn&#8722;Bi bond. All isolated compounds, were examined by NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy and except compound 1As by X&#8208;ray structure analysis. Moreover, were examined UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy and investigated the reactivity of these compounds towards different substrates in more detail. Starting with the compound [(Dipp2NacNac)SnAs(SiMe3)2] (2As), the reaction with red selenium yields [(Dipp2NacNac)Sn&#8722;Se&#8208;As(SiMe3)2] (4) which exhibits a Sn&#8722;Se&#8722;As chain.

         <title>Pyridine Iodine(I) Cations: Kinetic Trapping as a Sulfonate Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Seven pyridine iodine(I) sulfonate complexes were prepared and isolated at low temperatures and characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The inherently instable pyridine iodine(I) cations are stabilized by an oxygen of sulfonate anions via the I&#183;&#183;&#183;O halogen bond. In these complexes, the iodine atom of the pyridine iodine(I) cation acts as an electron acceptor and the sulfonate oxygen as the electron donor. These complexes are stable enough in the crystalline state, yet decompose rapidly under ambient conditions, also being unstable in solution. The (pyridine)N&#8211;I bond lengths [2.140(3) &#8208; 2.197(2) &#197;] and the I&#183;&#183;&#183;O halogen bonds [2.345(6) &#8208; 2.227(3) &#197;] are analogous to (imide)N&#8211;I&#183;&#183;&#183;O&#8211;N&#8208;pyridine uncharged halogen&#8208;bonded complexes formed from N&#8208;haloimides and pyridine N&#8208;oxides, thus confirming the existence of elusive pyridine iodine(I) cation.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of N&#8722;N Biaryl Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although N&#8722;N Biaryl atropisomers has emerged into valuable scaffolds in natural products, drug design and asymmetric synthesis, its asymmetric synthesis is scare until recently. This concept will focus on the asymmetric synthesis of the divergent N&#8722;N biaryl atropisomers scaffolds including N&#8722;N bipyrroles atropisomers, N&#8722;N pyrrole&#8722;indole atropisomers, N&#8722;N bisindoles atropisomers, N&#8722;N indole&#8722;carbazole atropisomers.







Abstract
Atropisomers have emerged as important structural scaffolds in natural products, drug design, and asymmetric synthesis. Recently, N&#8722;N biaryl atropisomers have drawn increasing interest due to their unique structure and relatively stable axes. However, its asymmetric synthesis remains scarce compared to its well&#8208;developed C&#8722;C biaryl analogs. In this concept, we summarize the asymmetric synthesis of N&#8722;N biaryl atropisomers including N&#8722;N pyrrole&#8722;pyrrole, N&#8722;N pyrrole&#8722;indole, N&#8722;N indole&#8722;indole, and N&#8722;N indole&#8722;carbazole, during which a series synthetic strategies are highlighted.

     alt="Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of N&#8722;N Biaryl Atropisomers"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although N&#8722;N Biaryl atropisomers has emerged into valuable scaffolds in natural products, drug design and asymmetric synthesis, its asymmetric synthesis is scare until recently. This concept will focus on the asymmetric synthesis of the divergent N&#8722;N biaryl atropisomers scaffolds including N&#8722;N bipyrroles atropisomers, N&#8722;N pyrrole&#8722;indole atropisomers, N&#8722;N bisindoles atropisomers, N&#8722;N indole&#8722;carbazole atropisomers.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atropisomers have emerged as important structural scaffolds in natural products, drug design, and asymmetric synthesis. Recently, N&#8722;N biaryl atropisomers have drawn increasing interest due to their unique structure and relatively stable axes. However, its asymmetric synthesis remains scarce compared to its well-developed C&#8722;C biaryl analogs. In this concept, we summarize the asymmetric synthesis of N&#8722;N biaryl atropisomers including N&#8722;N pyrrole&#8722;pyrrole, N&#8722;N pyrrole&#8722;indole, N&#8722;N indole&#8722;indole, and N&#8722;N indole&#8722;carbazole, during which a series synthetic strategies are highlighted. Also, a synthetic evolution is briefly reviewed and an outlook of N&#8722;N biaryl atropisomers synthesis is offered.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chiral and Achiral Crystal Structures of Au25(PET)180 Reveal Effects of Ligand Rotational Isomerization on Optoelectronic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Analysis of all Au25(phenylethanethiol)18 crystal structures, including 2 novel clusters, reveals that ligand rotational angles are interdependent and constrained to a narrow range of values.







Abstract
The crystal structures of 4 ligand&#8208;rotational isomers of Au25(PET)18 are presented. Two new ligand&#8208;rotational isomers are revealed, and two higher&#8208;quality structures (allowing complete solution of the ligand shell) of previously solved Au25(PET)18 clusters are also presented. One of the structures lacks an inversion center, making it the first chiral Au25(SR)18 structure solved. These structures combined with previously published Au25(SR)18 structures enable an analysis of the empirical ligand conformation landscape for Au25(SR)18 clusters. This analysis shows that the dihedral angles within the PET ligand are restricted to certain observable values, and also that the dihedral angle values are interdependent, in a manner reminiscent of biomolecule dihedral angles such as those in proteins and DNA. The influence of ligand conformational isomerism on optical and electronic properties was calculated, revealing that the ligand conformations affect the nanocluster absorption spectrum, which potentially provides a way to distinguish between isomers at low temperature.

         <title>Integrating Benzoxazine&#8208;PDMS 3D Networks with Carbon Nanotubes for flexible Pressure Sensors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our study focuses on preparing benzoxazine&#8208;terminated poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PH&#8208;PDMS) and developing elastomeric nanocomposites by incorporating multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). Through thermally curing, these nanocomposites demonstrate excellent electrical conductivity and mechanical stability, attributed to favorable MWCNT&#8208;matrix interactions which enable efficient dispersion of MWCNTs. These findings highlight the potential of these materials for pressure&#8208;sensing applications.







Abstract
Shapeable and flexible pressure sensors with superior mechanical and electrical properties are of major interest as they can be employed in a wide range of applications. In this regard, elastomer&#8208;based composites incorporating carbon nanomaterials in the insulating matrix embody an appealing solution for designing flexible pressure sensors with specific properties. In this study, PDMS chains of different molecular weight were successfully functionalized with benzoxazine moieties in order to thermally cure them without adding a second component, nor a catalyst or an initiator. These precursors were then blended with 1 weight percent of multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) using an ultrasound probe, which induced a transition from a liquid&#8208;like to a gel&#8208;like behavior as CNTs generate an interconnected network within the matrix. After curing, the resulting nanocomposites exhibit mechanical and electrical properties making them highly promising materials for pressure&#8208;sensing applications.

         <title>From One&#8208;Dimensional Disordered Racemate to Ordered Racemic Conglomerates through Metal&#8208;Coordination&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Assembly at the Liquid&#8208;Solid Interface</title>

Metal&#8208;driven transformation of a 1D disordered racemate self&#8208;assembled molecular network into a 2D racemic conglomerate metal&#8208;organic coordinated network at the solution&#8208;solid interface is described.







Abstract
In recent years, there has been significant focus on investigating and controlling chiral self&#8208;assembly, specifically in the context of enantiomeric separation. This study explores the self&#8208;assembly behavior of 4&#8208;dodecyl&#8208;3,6&#8208;di(2&#8208;pyridyl)pyridazine (DPP&#8722;C12) at the interface between heptanoic acid (HA) and highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) using a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and multiscale molecular modeling. The self&#8208;assembled monolayer structure formed by DPP&#8722;C12 is periodic in one direction, but aperiodic in the direction orthogonal to it. These structures resemble 1D disordered racemic compounds. Upon introducing palladium [Pd(II)] ions, complexing with DPP&#8722;C12, these 1D disordered racemic compounds spontaneously transform into 2D racemic conglomerates, which is rationalized with the assistance of force&#8208;field simulations. Our findings provide insights into the regulation of two&#8208;dimensional chirality.

         <title>A Discrete, Boron&#8208;Containing Triangular Triradical</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A neutral boron&#8208;containing triangular triradical based on a triptycene derivative has been synthesized. The triradical has isosceles triangle geometry due to Jahn&#8208;Teller distoration, leading to a doublet ground state. The work represents a rare example of an isolable neutral through&#8208;space triangular triradical.







Abstract
A neutral boron&#8208;containing triangular triradical based on a triptycene derivative has been designed and synthesized. Its structure, bonding and physical property have been studied by EPR spectroscopy, SQUID magnetometry and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, as well as theoretical calculations. The triradical has a series of isosceles triangle conformations in the solution due to the Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion, leading to the splitting of the two low&#8208;lying doublet states. This factor together with negligible spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) of composing light atoms quenches the spin frustration. The work represents a rare example of a neutral through&#8208;space triangular triradical.

         <title>Harnessing the Peterson Reaction for the Stereospecific Synthesis of Z&#8208;Vinyl Ethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near exclusive formation of a Z vinyl ether: A variant of the Peterson reaction generates Z vinyl ethers of the type RCH=CHOR&#8217; with very high stereoselectivity, a functionality found in natural plasmalogens. (R,R)/(S,S)&#8208;1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxyalkylsilanes, obtained from terminal alkynes, via 2&#8208;trimethylsilyl&#8208;3&#8208;substituted epoxides by regioselective, BF3&#8208;catalysed epoxide ring opening with an alcohol, were treated with KH in &#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;trifluorotoluene to give Z vinyl ethers (Z/E ratio: 99&#8201;:&#8201;1).







Abstract
Vinyl ethers are valuable synthetic intermediates which are also found as natural products, including aflatoxins, rifamycins and plasmalogens. The latter are ubiquitous phospholipids in human cells and contain a vinyl ether moiety with specifically Z configuration. Although numerous methods are available for synthesis of vinyl ethers, there is a lack of methods for obtaining Z isomers of molecules of the type RCH=CHOR&#8217; that are applicable to plasmalogens. A variant of the Peterson reaction is described that generates such molecules with very high stereoselectivity (Z/E ratio: 99&#8201;:&#8201;1). (R,R)/(S,S)&#8208;1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxyalkylsilanes were synthesized from 1&#8208;trimethylsilylalkynes by a sequence of reduction with di&#8208;isobutylaluminium hydride to a (Z)&#8208;1&#8208;trimethylsilylalkene, epoxidation of the alkene to a 2&#8208;trimethylsilyl&#8208;3&#8208;substituted epoxide and regioselective, boron&#8208;trifluoride catalyzed ring&#8208;opening of the epoxide by reaction with an alcohol. Conversion of the (R,R)/(S,S)&#8208;1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxyalkylsilanes to vinyl ethers (RCH=CHOR&#8217;) was achieved under basic conditions as in a standard Peterson reaction. However, near exclusive formation of a Z vinyl ether was only achieved when the reaction was performed using potassium hydride in the non&#8208;polar solvent &#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;trifluorotoluene, more polar solvents giving increasing amounts of the E isomer. The sequence described embraces a variety of substituents and precursors, proceeds in overall high yield and is readily scalable.

         <title>Exploration of the Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Sydnone and Sydnonimine&#8208;Alkyne Cycloaddition Reactions by High&#8208;Throughput Experimentation</title>

High&#8208;Throughput&#8208;Experimentation has been used to revisit the Cu&#8208;catalyzed Sydnone&#8208;Alkyne Cycloaddition reaction. The reaction has been improved and a new click&#8208;and&#8208;release reaction has been discovered.







Abstract
The reactivity of sydnones and sydnonimines toward terminal alkynes under copper catalysis has been explored using High&#8208;Throughput&#8208;Experimentation. A large panel of ligands and reaction conditions have been tested to optimize the copper&#8208;catalyzed sydnone click reaction discovered by our group ten years ago. This screening approach led to the identification of new ligands, which boosted the catalytic properties of copper and allowed the discovery of a new copper&#8208;catalyzed click&#8208;and&#8208;release reaction involving sydnonimines. This reaction allowed chemoselective ligation of terminal alkynes with sydnonimines and, simultaneously, the release of an isocyanate fragment molecule that can be used for further transformations.

         <title>Nucleophilicity of 4&#8208;(Alkylthio)&#8208;3&#8208;imidazoline Derived Enamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enamine activation is a key method to enhance the reactivity of carbonyl compounds in &#945;&#8208;alkylation reactions. In spite of their possible role in prebiotic chemistry, enamines derived from aldehydes and 4&#8208;(alkylthio)&#8208;3&#8208;imidazolines (TIMs) have scarcely been studied. Their reactivities have now been classified on the Mayr nucleophilicity scale by kinetic measurements. In addition, their Lewis basicities have been determined by DFT calculations and equilibrium measurements.







Abstract
Imidazolidine&#8208;4&#8208;thiones (ITOs) are cyclic, secondary amines that were considered as potential prebiotic organocatalysts for light&#8208;driven &#945;&#8208;alkylations of aldehydes by bromoacetonitrile (BAN). Recent studies showed that the initially supplied ITOs represent the pre&#8208;catalyst because they undergo S&#8208;alkylation with BAN to give 4&#8208;(alkylthio)&#8208;3&#8208;imidazolines (TIMs). Given that the same reagent mix that undergoes light&#8208;driven &#945;&#8208;alkylations is also effective in the dark, we synthesized ten ITO&#8208; or TIM&#8208;derived enamines of aldehydes and characterized their nucleophilic reactivities by kinetic studies in acetonitrile. The experimental second&#8208;order rate constants k2 for reactions of enamines with benzhydrylium ions (reference electrophiles) were evaluated by the Mayr&#8208;Patz equation, lg k2(20&#8201;&#176;C)=sN(N+E). The determined nucleophilicities N (and sN) reveal the reactivity profiles of these enamines under prebiotically relevant conditions as well as their potential for use in organocatalytic synthesis.

         <title>Halogen Bonding Tripodal Metallo&#8208;Receptors for Phosphate Recognition and Sensing in Aqueous&#8208;Containing Organic Media</title>

         <dc:description>
A series of tris(iodotriazole)&#8208;containing halogen bonding (XB) tripodal ZnII metallo&#8208;receptors, strategically designed for tetrahedral anion guest binding, are demonstrated to selectively recognise inorganic phosphate over more basic, mono&#8208;charged oxoanions and the halides in aqueous solvent media. The XB metallo&#8208;receptors display augmented anion affinities compared to their tris(prototriazole)&#8208;containing hydrogen bonding (HB) counterparts. The attachment of redox&#8208;active ferrocene moieties at the XB and HB tripodal receptor termini facilitated complementary electrochemical anion sensing capability.







Abstract
The anion recognition and electrochemical anion&#8208;sensing properties of halogen&#8208;bonding (XB) tripodal zinc(II) receptors strategically designed and constructed for tetrahedral anion guest binding are described. The XB tris(iodotriazole)&#8208;containing hosts exhibit high affinities and selectivities for inorganic phosphate over other more basic, mono&#8208;charged oxoanions such as acetate and the halides in a competitive CD3CN/D2O (9&#8201;:&#8201;1 v/v) aqueous solvent mixture. 1H&#8197;NMR anion binding and electrochemical voltammetric anion sensing studies with redox&#8208;active ferrocene functionalised metallo&#8208;tripodal receptor analogues, reveal each of the XB tripods as superior anion complexants when compared to their tris(prototriazole)&#8208;containing, hydrogen bonding (HB) counterparts, not only exemplifying the halogen bond as a strong alternative interaction to the traditional hydrogen bond for molecular recognition but also providing rare evidence of the ability of XB receptors to preferentially bind the &#8220;harder&#8221; phosphate oxoanion over the &#8220;softer&#8221; and less hydrated halides in aqueous containing media.

         <title>Fluorinated Benzimidazole&#8208;Linked Highly Conjugated Polymer Enabling Covalent Polysulfide Anchoring for Stable Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Economical sulfur in p&#8208;block is valuable for charge storage, but dissolves in electrolytes, limiting battery use. Fluorine&#8208;substituted benzimidazole polymer, treated with S8 via SNAr, anchors polysulfides for electrochemical redox&#8208;activity. Sulfurized polymer electrodes mitigate polysulfide shuttle in Li&#8722;S batteries and enable eco&#8208;friendly Al&#8722;S batteries. The strategy involves the chemistry of p&#8208;block elements such as C, N, S, Al, F, and Cl.







Abstract
Sulfur is one of the most abundant and economical elements in the p&#8208;block family and highly redox active, potentially utilizable as a charge&#8208;storing electrode with high theoretical capacities. However, its inherent good solubility in many electrolytes inhibits its accessibility as an electrode material in typical metal&#8208;sulfur batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Economical sulfur in p-block is valuable for charge storage, but dissolves in electrolytes, limiting battery use. Fluorine-substituted benzimidazole polymer, treated with S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; via S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;Ar, anchors polysulfides for electrochemical redox-activity. Sulfurized polymer electrodes mitigate polysulfide shuttle in Li&#8722;S batteries and enable eco-friendly Al&#8722;S batteries. The strategy involves the chemistry of p-block elements such as C, N, S, Al, F, and Cl.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sulfur is one of the most abundant and economical elements in the p-block family and highly redox active, potentially utilizable as a charge-storing electrode with high theoretical capacities. However, its inherent good solubility in many electrolytes inhibits its accessibility as an electrode material in typical metal-sulfur batteries. In this work, the synthetically designed fluorinated porous polymer, when treated with elemental sulfur through a well-known nucleophilic aromatic substitution mechanism (S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;Ar), allows for the covalent integration of polysulfides into a highly conjugated benzimidazole polymer by replacing the fluorine atoms. Chemically robust benzimidazole linkages allow such harsh post-synthetic treatment and facilitate the electronic activation of the anchored polysulfides for redox reactions under applied potential. The electrode amalgamated with sulfurized polymer mitigates the so-called polysulfide shuttle effect in the lithium-sulfur (Li&#8722;S) battery and also enables a reversible, more environmentally friendly, and more economical aluminum-sulfur (Al&#8722;S) battery that is configured with mostly p-block elements as cathode, anode, and electrolytes. The improved cycling stabilities and reduction of the overpotential in both cases pave the way for future sustainable energy storage solutions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Customized Synthesis of MOF Nanoplates via Molecular Scalpel Strategy for Efficient Oxygen Reduction in Zn&#8722;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>

The 2D MOF nanoplates from a layer&#8208;pillared 3D MOF is achieved, via a molecular scalpel strategy, by utilizing pyridine to replace 4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine. The morphology can be modified from hexagonal nanorods to nanoplates with controllable thickness tuned by the amounts of pyridine. The annealed nanoplates display high ORR activity (0.88&#8197;V).







Abstract
The production of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanoplates with well&#8208;defined geometric morphology is remarkable for expanding their applications. Herein, the cobalt&#8208;based MOF nanoplates with hexagonal channels from a layer&#8208;pillared MOF are accomplished, via a molecular scalpel strategy, utilizing monodentate pyridine to replace the bidentate 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine. The morphology can be modified from nanorods to nanoplates with controllable thickness tuned by the amounts of pyridine. Succeeding carbonization treatment transforms the MOF nanoplates into Co particles homogeneously encapsulated in the nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon layers. The prepared catalyst with a unique platelike morphology displays a high half&#8208;wave potential of 0.88&#8197;V in oxygen reduction reaction. When used in primary Zn&#8722;air batteries, it delivers a high peak power density of 280&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work clarifies the structure&#8208;morphology&#8208;reactivity connection of MOF nanoplates.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Modulated Reversible Clustering of Gold Nanorods Driven by Small Surface Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In thermoresponsive plasmonics, size does matter: This study presents a strategy for preparing thermosensitive gold nanorods clustering reversibly over a broad temperature range and reaching interparticle gaps as small as 1&#8197;nm in the clustered state. This enables the possibility to exploit the full promise of plasmonic coupling and the generation of dynamic hotspots.







Abstract
Temperature&#8208;modulated colloidal phase of plasmonic nanoparticles is a convenient playground for resettable soft&#8208;actuators or colorimetric sensors. To render reversible clustering under temperature change, bulky ligands are required, especially if anisotropic morphologies are of interest. This study showcases thermoresponsive gold nanorods by employing small surface ligands, bis (p&#8208;sulfonatophenyl) phenyl&#8208;phosphine dihydrate dipotassium salt (BSPP) and native cationic surfactant. Temperature&#8208;dependent analysis in real&#8208;time allowed to describe the structural features (interparticle distance and cluster size) as well as thermal parameters, melting and freezing temperatures. These findings suggest that neither covalent Au&#8722;S bonds nor bulky ligands are required to obtain a robust thermoresponsive system based on anisotropic gold nanoparticles, paving the way to stimuli&#8208;responsive nanoparticles with a wide range of sizes and geometries.

The incorporation of Co doping induces a local electric field and built&#8208;in magnetic field, thereby facilitating electron transfer and modulating the dynamic trajectory of Li+ ions, ultimately resulting in homogeneous Li deposition.







Abstract
Lithium metal batteries are deemed as an optimal candidate for the next generation of durable energy storage devices. However, the growth of lithium dendrite and significant volume expansion pose as obstacles that impede the application of lithium metal batteries. In this work, a functional copper current collector was designed by coating it with Co&#8208;doped ZnO (Co/ZnO) to enhance the lithiophilicity through local electric fields and built&#8208;in magnetic fields induced by the ferromagnetic material. The incorporation of Co not only induces a local electric field and thus accelerating electron transfer, but also imparts the ferromagnetic behavior to ZnO, resulting in an internal magnetic field to regulate the dynamic trajectory. Profiting from the above advantages, the symmetric cells have excellent cycle stability in 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, maintaining ultra&#8208;low voltage for over 2000&#8197;h. This study provides a realizable pathway for next&#8208;generation current collector of copper modification.

         <title>Probing Radical Addition to 1&#8208;Phosphabutadienes by Employing Muonium as a &#8220;Light Isotope&#8221; of Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The radical addition to 1&#8208;phosphabutadienes, Mes*P=CMe&#8722;CR=CH2 (R=H, Me) using muonium (Mu) as an H&#8208;atom analogue affords unprecedented, delocalized phosphaallylic radicals: Mes*P&#8901;&#8722;CMe=CR(CMuH2)&#8596;Mes*P=CMe&#8722;&#8901;CR(CMuH2). Structural elucidation was accomplished using muon spin spectroscopy (&#956;SR) which takes advantage of the nuclear spin properties of the Mu (Mu=&#956;++e&#8722;). This study provides important insights into the radical reactivity of low&#8208;coordinate phosphorus species, which are actively being investigated for their uses in functional macromolecule formation.







Abstract
Understanding free radical addition to multiple bonds is important to elucidating the mechanistic details of addition polymerization reactions, albeit the fleeting radical intermediates are very difficult to detect by conventional methodologies. Muon spin spectroscopy (&#956;SR) is a highly sensitive method that can detect radical species at 106 spins (cf. EPR: 1012 spins, NMR: 1018 spins). Herein, we employ &#956;SR to detect the radical&#8208;addition products from three 1&#8208;phosphabutadiene monomers, P&#8208;analogues of isoprene. We show that muonium (Mu), a &#8220;light&#8221; H&#8208;atom surrogate, adds predominantly at the C4 position of the P1=C2&#8722;C3=C4 moiety to give unprecedented 1&#8208;phosphaallyl radicals as the major products. Our structural assignments are supported by assignment of muon, phosphorus and proton hyperfine coupling constants using DFT&#8208;calculations. A minor radical product is also detected that is tentatively assigned to an PC3&#8208;heterocyclic free radical. On the basis of DFT&#8208;predictions, we speculate that its formation may involve initial addition of Mu+ at the C3 position followed by electron capture. These studies provide rare insights into the prospective radical (or cationic) polymerization of 1&#8208;phosphabutadienes, which have previously been polymerized using anionic initiation.

A minor radical product is also detected that is tentatively assigned to an PC&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-heterocyclic free radical. On the basis of DFT-predictions, we speculate that its formation may involve initial addition of Mu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; at the C&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; position followed by electron capture. These studies provide rare insights into the prospective radical (or cationic) polymerization of 1-phosphabutadienes, which have previously been polymerized using anionic initiation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bimetallic Manganese Catalysts: A Route to Controlled and Switchable Polymerization of Lactones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bimetallic Salen&#8208;Mn catalysts with biaryl&#8208;linkers were developed for ring&#8208;opening polymerization of lactide and &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone. Advanced activity and the iso&#8208;selective tendency towards lactide are determined by catalyst conformation and Mn&#8722;Mn separation. Finally, the CO2&#8208;controlled switchable polymerization succeeded in this catalytic system, in which the on&#8208;off reversibility is related to the combination between active species and CO2 molecules.







Abstract
The sustainable solution to the environmental problem of polymeric materials calls for efficient and well&#8208;controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization catalytic systems. Inspired by the highly reactive and stereospecific bimetallic catalysts, three kinds of bimetallic Salen&#8208;Mn catalysts supported by biaryl linking moieties are synthesized and applied to polymerization catalysis of lactide (LA) and &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone (&#1013;&#8208;CL) in this work. The polymerization is initiated in&#8197;situ by the ring&#8208;opening of epoxide compounds, in which the ionic cocatalyst could accelerate the reaction process. The Mn&#8722;Mn coordination effect contributes to the higher activity and iso&#8208;selectivity towards LA compared to the mononuclear Salen&#8208;Mn catalyst. The reactivity and stereoselectivity are determined by the conformation of catalysts, specifically the Mn&#8722;Mn separation and dihedral angle. Finally, the CO2&#8208;controlled switchable polymerizations are carried out with LA and &#1013;&#8208;CL. The reversibility of the on&#8208;off switching operation is influenced by the combination between CO2 molecules and active species. The success in binuclear Salen&#8208;Mn catalysts not only expands the range of bimetallic catalyst analogues but also claims the promising potential of Mn&#8208;based catalysts in practical and theoretical research.

         <title>Sheet&#8208;Isolated MoS2 Used for Dispersing Pt Nanoparticles and its Application in Methanol Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isolation of NMWCNTs weakens the &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking, improves the conductivity, and activates basal planes of the MoS2 sheets. Consequently, the prepared Pt/NWMCNTs&#8208;solated&#8208;MoS2 realizes excellent bifunctional catalytic performance for MOR and ORR.







Abstract
It is highly challenging to activate the basal plane and minimize the &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking of MoS2 sheets, thus enhancing its catalytic performance. Here, we display an approach for making well&#8208;dispersed MoS2. By using the N&#8208;doped multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (NMWCNTs) as an isolation unit, the aggregation of MoS2 sheets was effectively reduced, favoring the dispersion of Pt nanoparticles (noted as Pt/NMWCNTs&#8208;isolated&#8208;MoS2). Excellent bifunctional catalytic performance for methanol oxidation and oxygen reduction reaction (MOR/ORR) were demonstrated by the produced Pt/NMWCNTs&#8208;isolated&#8208;MoS2. In comparison to Pt nanoparticles supported on MoS2 (Pt/MoS2), the MOR activity (2314.14&#8197;mA&#8201;mgpt&#8722;1) and stability (317.69&#8197;mA&#8201;mgpt&#8722;1 after 2&#8197;h of operation) on Pt/NMWCNTs&#8208;isolatedMoS2 were 24 and 232 times higher, respectively. As for ORR, Pt/NMWCNTs&#8208;isolated&#8208;MoS2 holds large half&#8208;wave potential (0.88&#8197;V) and high stability (92.71&#8201;% after 22&#8197;h of operation). This work presents a tactic for activating the basal planes and reducing the &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking of 2D materials to satisfy their applications in electrocatalysis. In addition, the proposed sheet&#8208;isolation method can be used for fabricating other 2D materials to promote the dispersion of nanoparticles, which assist its application in other fields of energy as well as the environment.

         <title>2&#8208;Pyridone Formation: An Efficient Method for the Solid&#8208;Phase Synthesis of Homodimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient and operationally simple method is presented for the solid&#8208;phase synthesis of homodimeric protein ligands from a single precursor through acid&#8208; or I2/acetone&#8208;mediated formation of a 2&#8208;pyridone linkage.







Abstract
This study presents an efficient method for on&#8208;resin dimer generation through self&#8208;condensation of 3,3&#8208;dimethoxypropionic acid&#8208;modified molecules, resulting in 2&#8208;pyridones. The approach demonstrated remarkable versatility by producing homodimers of peptides, peptoids, and non&#8208;peptidic ligands. Its ease of application, broad utility, and mild reaction conditions not only hold significance for peptide and peptoid research but also offer potential for the on&#8208;resin development of a wide range of bivalent ligands.

         <title>Extremely Stable Perylene Bisimide&#8208;Bridged Regioisomeric Diradicals and Their Redox Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>

The partially conjugated connection via C&#8722;C single bonds between a PBI bridge and TTM segments can restrain the formation of closed&#8208;shell quinone resonance structures to obtain pure diradicals. The three building blocks not only keep their inherent characteristics but also exist electronic communication that causes distinct and reversible multistep redox processes and contributes to extremely high stability under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Excellent stability is an essential premise for organic diradicals to be used in organic electronic and spintronic devices. We have attached two tris(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM) radical building blocks to the two sides of perylene bisimide (PBI) bridges and obtained two regioisomeric diradicals (1,6&#8208;TTM&#8208;PBI and 1,7&#8208;TTM&#8208;PBI). Both of the isomers show super stability rather than the monomeric TTM under ambient conditions, due to the increased conjugation and the electron&#8208;withdrawing effects of the PBI bridges. The diradicals show distinct and reversible multistep redox processes, and a spectro&#8208;electrochemistry investigation revealed the generation of organic mixed&#8208;valence (MV) species during reduction processes. The two diradicals have singlet ground states, very small singlet&#8211;triplet energy gaps (&#916;ES&#8208;T) and a pure open&#8208;shell character (with diradical character y0=0.966 for 1,6&#8208;TTM&#8208;PBI and 0.967 for 1,7&#8208;TTM&#8208;PBI). This work opens a window to developing very stable diradicals and offers the opportunity of their further application in optical, electronic and magnetic devices.

         <title>Calamitic Liquid Crystals for Reversible Light&#8208;Modulated Phase Regulation Based on Arylazopyrazole Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of light responsive arylazopyrazole mesogens and their light&#8208;controlled liquid&#8208;crystalline phase regulation are reported. These compounds can act as a dopant in commercially available liquid crystals to provide fast and microscale optical responses at ambient temperatures.







Abstract
The design of responsive liquid crystals enables a diversity of technological applications. Especially photochromic liquid crystals gained a lot of interest in recent years due to the excellent spatiotemporal control of their phase transitions. In this work we present calamitic light responsive mesogens based on a library of arylazopyrazole photoswitches. These compounds show liquid&#8208;crystalline behavior as shown by differential scanning calorimetry, grazing incidence X&#8208;ray diffraction and polarized optical microscopy. UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy and NMR analysis confirmed the excellent photophysical properties in solution and thin film. Additionally, polarized optical microscopy studies of the pristine compounds show reversible phase transition upon irradiation with light. Moreover, as a dopant in the commercially available liquid crystal 4&#8208;cyano&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;pentylbiphenyl (5CB), the temperature range was reduced to ambient temperatures while preserving the photophysical properties. Remarkably, this co&#8208;assembled system shows reversible liquid&#8208;crystalline to isotropic phase transition upon irradiation with light of different wavelengths. The spatiotemporal control of the phase transition of the liquid crystals offers opportunities in the development of optical devices.

A new purely organic supramolecular framework based on hexakis[60]fullerene is capable of absorbing and releasing chloroform through internal structural reorganization.







Abstract
The design of dynamic structures with high recognition host&#8208;guest materials capable to host selectively small volatile molecules is an emergent field of research with both fundamental and applied implications. The challenge of exploring novel materials with advanced functionalities has led to the development of dynamic crystalline structures promoted by soft interactions. Here, a new pure organic dynamic framework based on hexakis[60]fullerene that are held together by weak van der Waals interactions is described. This crystalline structure is capable of absorbing and releasing chloroform, through internal structural reorganization. This research provides new insight into the design of organic molecular crystals for selective adsorption applications.

         <title>Advancing Gold Redox Catalysis: Mechanistic Insights, Nucleophilicity&#8208;Guided Transmetalation, and Predictive Frameworks for the Oxidation of Aryl Gold(I) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study (1) resolved a longstanding query in the field of gold redox catalysis concerning the reaction between PhICl2 and [(Ar)Au(PR3)] by unveiling the mechanism for transmetallation between gold(I) and gold(III) complexes, (2) utilized this insight to develop a predictive conceptual framework for this reaction, and (3) experimentally validated the reliability of the prediction, establishing a foundation for advancements in this field.







Abstract
Gold redox catalysis, often facilitated by hypervalent iodine(III) reagents, offers unique reactivity but its progress is mainly hindered by an incomplete mechanistic understanding. In this study, we investigated the reaction between the gold(I) complexes [(aryl)Au(PR3)] and the hypervalent iodine(III) reagent PhICl2, both experimentally and computationally and provided an explanation for the formation of divergent products as the ligands bonded to the gold(I) center change. We tackled this essential question by uncovering an intriguing transmetalation mechanism that takes place between gold(I) and gold(III) complexes. We found that the ease of transmetalation is governed by the nucleophilicity of the gold(I) complex, [(aryl)Au(PR3)], with greater nucleophilicity leading to a lower activation energy barrier. Remarkably, transmetalation is mainly controlled by a single orbital &#8211; the gold dx2&#8722;y2 orbital. This orbital also has a profound influence on the reactivity of the oxidative addition step. In this way, the fundamental mechanistic basis of divergent outcomes in reactions of aryl gold(I) complexes with PhICl2 was established and these observations are reconciled from first principles. The theoretical model developed in this study provides a conceptual framework for anticipating the outcomes of reactions involving [(aryl)Au(PR3)] with PhICl2, thereby establishing a solid foundation for further advancements in this field.

         <title>Cage Match: Comparing the Anion Binding Ability of Isostructural Versus Isofunctional Pairs of Metal&#8208;Organic Nanocages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three Pt&#8208;linked porphyrin nanocages were used to examine how the structure and functionality of hosts influence their anion binding ability. Two isostructural M6L312+ cages exhibit similar high affinities (&gt;107&#8197;M&#8722;1) for aryl carboxylates and sulfonates despite the hosts differing greatly in hydrogen&#8208;bonding ability. Proton&#8208;responsive behavior was used to toggle between binding the benzoate guests and a weaker binding perfluorooctanoate anion.







Abstract
Affinities of six anions (mesylate, acetate, trifluoroacetate, p&#8208;toluenecarboxylate, p&#8208;toluenesulfonate, and perfluorooctanoate) for three related Pt2+&#8208;linked porphyrin nanocages were measured to probe the influence of different noncovalent recognition motifs (e.&#8201;g., hydrogen bonding, electrostatics, &#960; bonding) on anion binding. Two new hosts of M6L312+ (1b) and M4L28+ (2) composition (M=(en)Pt2+, L=(3&#8208;py)4porphyrin) were prepared in a one&#8208;pot synthesis and allowed comparison of hosts that differ in structure while maintaining similar N&#8722;H hydrogen&#8208;bond donor ability. Comparisons of isostructural hosts that differ in hydrogen&#8208;bonding ability were made between 1b and a related M6L312+ nanoprism (1a, M=(tmeda)Pt2+) that lacks N&#8722;H groups. Considerable variation in association constants (K1=1.6&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1 to 1.3&#215;108&#8197;M&#8722;1) and binding mode (exo vs. endo) were found for different host&#8211;guest combinations. Strongest binding was seen between p&#8208;toluenecarboxylate and 1b, but surprisingly, association of this guest with 1a was only slightly weaker despite the absence of NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interactions. The high affinity between p&#8208;toluenecarboxylate and 1a could be turned off by protonation, and this behavior was used to toggle between the binding of this guest and the environmental pollutant perfluorooctanoate, which otherwise has a lower affinity for the host.

         <title>High&#8208;Mannose Oligosaccharide Hemimimetics that Recapitulate the Conformation and Binding Mode to Concanavalin A, DC&#8208;SIGN and Langerin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#8220;carbohydrate chemical mimicry&#8221; of sp2&#8208;iminosugars enables the synthesis of high&#8208;mannose&#8208;type oligosaccharide analogs whose solution and lectin bound conformations match those of the natural partners. Upon multivalent presentation, enhanced affinities towards ConA, DC&#8208;SIGN and langerin are achieved, with distinct selectivity profiles.







Abstract
The &#8220;carbohydrate chemical mimicry&#8221; exhibited by sp2&#8208;iminosugars has been utilized to develop practical syntheses for analogs of the branched high&#8208;mannose&#8208;type oligosaccharides (HMOs) Man3 and Man5. In these compounds, the terminal nonreducing Man residues have been substituted with 5,6&#8208;oxomethylidenemannonojirimycin (OMJ) motifs. The resulting oligomannoside hemimimetic accurately reproduce the structure, configuration, and conformational behavior of the original mannooligosaccharides, as confirmed by NMR and computational techniques. Binding studies with mannose binding lectins, including concanavalin A, DC&#8208;SIGN, and langerin, by enzyme&#8208;linked lectin assay and surface plasmon resonance revealed significant variations in their ability to accommodate the OMJ unit in the mannose binding site. Intriguingly, OMJMan segments demonstrated &#8220;in line&#8221; heteromultivalent effects during binding to the three lectins. Similar to the mannobiose (Man2) branches in HMOs, the binding modes involving the external or internal monosaccharide unit at the carbohydrate binding&#8208;domain exist in equilibrium, facilitating sliding and recapture processes. This equilibrium, which influences the multivalent binding of HMOs, can be finely modulated upon incorporation of the OMJ sp2&#8208;iminosugar caps. As a proof of concept, the affinity and selectivity towards DC&#8208;SIGN and langerin were adjustable by presenting the OMJMan epitope in platforms with diverse architectures and valencies.

         <title>Revealing the Origin of Fast Delayed Fluorescence in a Donor Functionalized Bisterpyridine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two different, extremely short fluorescence lifetimes were found for a new carbazole&#8208;substituted bisbipyridine. Various methods, including tempered TCSPC, DFT and NMR spectroscopy were used to show the presence of two rotamers. These can transition into each other after optical excitation, causing two temporally different fluorescence events.







Abstract
A new carbazole&#8208;substituted bisterpyridine with pronounced delayed fluorescence is presented. While the molecular donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor design suggests the origin of this to be thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), results from various photophysical characterizations, OLED characteristics, temperature&#8208;dependent NMR spectroscopy, and DFT calculations all point against the involvement of triplet states. The molecule exhibits blue emission at about 440&#8197;nm with two or more fast decay channels in the lower nanosecond range in both solution and thin films. The delayed emission is proposed to be caused by rotational vibrational modes. We suggest that these results are generally applicable, especially for more complex molecules, and should be considered as alternative or competitive emissive relaxation pathways in the field of organic light emitting materials.

An electrochemical synthesis of gold(I)&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (Au&#8208;NHC) complexes has been developed in which the only by&#8208;product is hydrogen gas. This enables the clean Au&#8208;NHC complexes to be transferred directly to subsequent catalytic reactions without extra work&#8208;up. This telescoped methodology has been showcased for several mononuclear and dinuclear Au&#8208;NHC complexes in a catalytic vinylcyclopropanation reaction, delivering high yields and demonstrating procedural simplicity.







Abstract
An electrochemical synthesis of gold(I)&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (Au&#8208;NHC) complexes has been developed. The electrochemical methodology uses only imidazolium salts, gold metal electrodes, and electricity to produce these complexes with hydrogen gas as the only by&#8208;product. This high&#8208;yielding and operationally simple procedure has been used to produce eight mononuclear and three dinuclear Au&#8208;NHC complexes. The electrochemical procedure facilitates a clean reaction with no by&#8208;products. As such, Au&#8208;NHC complexes can be directly transferred to catalytic reactions without work&#8208;up or purification. The Au&#8208;NHC complexes were produced on&#8208;demand and tested as catalysts in a vinylcyclopropanation reaction. All mononuclear Au&#8208;NHC complexes performed similarly to or better than the isolated complexes.

         <title>CoFe Alloys Dispersed on Se, N Co&#8208;Doped Graphitic Carbon as Efficient Bifunctional Catalysts for Zn&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
CoFe/Se@CN with abundant porous structure was obtained through a self&#8208;sacrificing template method. The large specific surface area and the mesopores of CoFe/Se@CN provide rich active sites and facilitate the transport and transfer of protons and electrons. The abundant defects formed by doping Se enhance the oxygen adsorption/activation of carbon surfaces and increase active sites. Under the synergistic effect of CoFe alloys and Se, N co&#8208;doped graphitic carbon, CoFe/Se@CN exhibits excellent ORR and OER properties with an ultralow potential gap of 0.625&#8197;V.







Abstract
The development of a stable and efficient non&#8208;noble metal catalyst with both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is paramount to achieving the widespread application of Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) but remains a great challenge. Herein, a novel Co3Fe7 alloy nanoparticle dispersed on Se, N co&#8208;doped graphitic carbon (denoted as CoFe/Se@CN) was prepared through a facile hydrothermal and pyrolysis process. The synthesized CoFe/Se@CN exhibits outstanding ORR and OER properties with an ultralow potential gap of 0.625&#8197;V, which is mainly attributed to the abundant porous structure, the rich structural defects formed by doping Se atoms, and the strong synergistic effects between the CoFe alloys and graphitic carbon nanosheet. Furthermore, the ZAB fabricated by CoFe/Se@CN shows a high peak power density of 160&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a large specific capacity of 802&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 with favorable cycling stability, outperforming that of Pt/C+RuO2. Our study offers a plausible strategy to explore bifunctional carbon&#8208;based materials with efficient electrocatalytic properties for rechargeable ZABs.

         <title>Visible Light Activates Coumarin&#8208;Caged mRNA for Cytoplasmic Cap Methylation in Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 5&#8242; cap with coumarin at the N7G was prepared in two different ways. It can be used to make mRNAs and to activate the process of cytoplasmic cap methylation in cells by visible light.







Abstract
Protein synthesis is important and regulated by various mechanisms in the cell. Translation initiation in eukaryotes starts at the 5&#8242; cap and is the most complex of the three phases of mRNA translation. It requires methylation of the N7 position of the terminal guanosine (m7G). The canonical capping occurs in the nucleus, however, cytoplasmic recapping has been discovered. It functions in switching mRNAs between translating and non&#8208;translating states, but the individual steps are difficult to dissect. We targeted cytoplasmic cap methylation as the ultimate step of cytoplasmic recapping. We present an N7G photocaged 5&#8242; cap that can be activated for cytoplasmic methylation by visible light. We report chemical and chemo&#8208;enzymatic synthesis of this 5&#8242; cap with 7&#8208;(diethylamino)&#8208;4&#8208;methyl&#8208;coumarin (DEACM) at the N7G and validate that it is not bound by translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E). We demonstrate incorporation into mRNA, the release of unmethylated cap analog and enzymatic remethylation to functional cap 0 after irradiation at 450&#8197;nm.

     alt="Visible Light Activates Coumarin-Caged mRNA for Cytoplasmic Cap Methylation in Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 5&#8242; cap with coumarin at the N7G was prepared in two different ways. It can be used to make mRNAs and to activate the process of cytoplasmic cap methylation in cells by visible light.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protein synthesis is important and regulated by various mechanisms in the cell. Translation initiation in eukaryotes starts at the 5&#8242; cap and is the most complex of the three phases of mRNA translation. It requires methylation of the N7 position of the terminal guanosine (m&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;G). The canonical capping occurs in the nucleus, however, cytoplasmic recapping has been discovered. It functions in switching mRNAs between translating and non-translating states, but the individual steps are difficult to dissect. We targeted cytoplasmic cap methylation as the ultimate step of cytoplasmic recapping. We present an N7G photocaged 5&#8242; cap that can be activated for cytoplasmic methylation by visible light. We report chemical and chemo-enzymatic synthesis of this 5&#8242; cap with 7-(diethylamino)-4-methyl-coumarin (DEACM) at the N7G and validate that it is not bound by translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E). We demonstrate incorporation into mRNA, the release of unmethylated cap analog and enzymatic remethylation to functional cap 0 after irradiation at 450&#8197;nm. In cells, irradiation triggers translation of mRNAs with the N7G photocaged 5&#8242; cap via cytoplasmic cap methylation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Generation and Application of Homoallylic &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Diboryl Radicals via Diboron&#8208;Promoted Ring&#8208;Opening of Vinyl Cyclopropanes: cis&#8208;Diastereoselective Borylative Cycloaddition

A versatile access to homoallylic &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diboryl radicals has been developed by using geminal diboryl group as an activator of vinyl cyclopropane (VCP) ring opening. These boron&#8208;stabilized radicals participated in [3+2] cycloaddition reaction with a variety of alkenes to provide diboryl&#8208;cyclopentanes in a cis&#8208;diastereoselective fashion which was confirmed and rationalized by quantitative NOE and DFT studies.







Abstract
Carbon&#8208;centered radicals stabilized by adjacent boron atoms are underexplored reaction intermediates in organic synthesis. This study reports the development of vinyl cyclopropyl diborons (VCPDBs) as a versatile source of previously unknown homoallylic &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diboryl radicals via thiyl radical catalyzed diboron&#8208;directed ring opening. These diboryl stabilized radicals underwent smooth [3+2] cycloaddition with a variety of olefins to provide diboryl cyclopentanes in good to excellent diastereoselectivity. In contrast to the trans&#8208;diastereoselectivity observed with most of the dicarbonyl activated VCPs, the cycloaddition of VCPDBs showed a remarkable preference for formation of cis&#8208;cyclopentane diastereomer which was confirmed by quantitative NOE and 2D NOESY studies. The cis&#8208;stereochemistry of cyclopentane products enabled a concise intramolecular Heck reaction approach to rare tricyclic cyclopentanoid framework containing the diboron group. The mild reaction conditions also allowed a one&#8208;pot VCP ring&#8208;opening, cycloaddition&#8208;oxidation sequence to afford disubstituted cyclopentanones. Control experiments and DFT analysis of reaction mechanism support a radical mediated pathway and provide a rationale for the observed diastereoselectivity. To the authors&#8217; knowledge, these are the first examples of the use of geminal diboryl group as an activator of VCP ring opening and cycloaddition reaction of &#945;&#8208;boryl radicals.

         <title>A Proof&#8208;of&#8208;Principle Design for Through&#8208;Space Transmission of Unidirectional Rotary Motion by Molecular Photogears
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stereochemical approach to transmitting the directional double&#8208;bond rotary motion of light&#8208;driven molecular motors through space onto a remote single&#8208;bond axis is put forth and successfully tested by means of quantum&#8208;chemical modeling. A key result in the assessment of the approach is that the desired photogearing process is favorable compared to the undesired, free&#8208;standing single&#8208;bond rotation process (&#8220;slippage&#8221;) with which it competes.







Abstract
The construction of molecular photogears that can achieve through&#8208;space transmission of the unidirectional double&#8208;bond rotary motion of light&#8208;driven molecular motors onto a remote single&#8208;bond axis is a formidable challenge in the field of artificial molecular machines. Here, we present a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle design of such photogears that is based on the possibility of using stereogenic substituents to control both the relative stabilities of two helical forms of the photogear and the double&#8208;bond photoisomerization reaction that connects them. The potential of the design was verified by quantum&#8208;chemical modeling through which photogearing was found to be a favorable process compared to free&#8208;standing single&#8208;bond rotation (&#8220;slippage&#8221;). Overall, our study unveils a surprisingly simple approach to realizing unidirectional photogearing.

Mimicking nature's efficient nanomotors: The ability to perform mechanical work far away from the rotation axes of light&#8208;driven molecular motors is a key component of future synthetic molecular machinery. The center of the cover image shows a molecular photogear with this ability, with the spiralling arrow indicating the direction of a full photogearing cycle. In the background, the gearing process is represented by cogwheels. More information can be found in the Research Article by E.&#8197;M. Arpa, S.

         <dc:description>
A birefringent thin film of liquid crystals based on photoswitchable arylazopyrazoles has been created. The typical schlieren structure is indicative of calamitic liquid crystals. Upon irradiation with UV light, the mesogen photoisomerizes from E to Z, and the liquid crystal instantaneously forms an isotropic liquid. Upon irradiation with green light, the mesogen photoisomerizes from Z to E, and the liquid crystal reassembles. The phase transition can be induced locally using an optical fiber. More information can be found in the Research Article by B.&#8197;J. Ravoo and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302958).

Demand for structurally diverse organosilanols has been increasing, and thus this Review summarized the progress in the catalyzed synthesis of silanols via hydroxylation of hydrosilanes in the last decade, with a particular emphasis on the latest elegant developments in the desymmetrization strategy for the enantioselective synthesis of silicon&#8208;stereogenic silanols from dihydrosilanes.







Abstract
As a crucial class of functional molecules in organosilicon chemistry, silanols are found valuable applications in the fields of modern science and will be a potentially powerful framework for biologically active compounds or functional materials. It has witnessed an increasing demand for non&#8208;natural organosilanols, as well as the progress in the synthesis of these structural features. From the classic preparative methods to the catalytic selective oxidation of hydrosilanes, electrochemical hydrolysis of hydrosilanes, and then the construction of the most challenging silicon&#8208;stereogenic silanols. This review summarized the progress in the catalyzed synthesis of silanols via hydroxylation of hydrosilanes in the last decade, with a particular emphasis on the latest elegant developments in the desymmetrization strategy for the enantioselective synthesis of silicon&#8208;stereogenic silanols from dihydrosilanes.

         <title>Recent Developments of Dual Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Nitrogen Reduction Reaction</title>

In recent years, DSACs for ENRR have been developed rapidly. We give essential characterization and detection methods after reviewing DSACs&#8242; coordination environments, support materials, the N2 molecule, and NRR mechanism configuration. Finally, we suggested electrochemical NRR research issues, answers, and future directions.







Abstract
Ammonia is vital for fertilizer production, hydrogen storage, and alternative fuels. The conventional Haber&#8208;Bosch process for ammonia production is energy&#8208;intensive and environmentally harmful. Designing environmentally friendly and low&#8208;energy consumption strategies for electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (ENRR) in mild conditions is meaningful. Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have been studied extensively for NRR due to their high atomic utilization and unique electronic structure but are limited by their poor faradic efficiency and low ammonia formation yield. Dual single&#8208;atom catalysts (DSACs) have recently emerged as a promising solution for the effective activation of molecular N2, providing diverse active sites and synergistic interactions between adjacent atoms. In this review, we summarize the latest advances in metal DSACs for electrochemical ENRR based on both theoretical calculations and experimental studies, including aspects such as their variety, coordination, support, N2 adsorption and activity mechanisms, the characterization of NRR and electrochemical cell Configuration. We also address challenges and prospects in this rapidly evolving field, providing a comprehensive overview of DSACs for ENRR.

         <title>Energy transfer on cytoskeleton of red blood cell ghosts and&#160;their efficiency control by KCl concentration&#8208;induced cell shrinkage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lipid bilayer membranes such as liposomes have been utilized as reactors to construct bioinspired artificial photosynthesis. Embedding functional compounds, including chromophores and catalysts, into two&#8208;dimensional lipid membranes allows their high local concentration and proximity, resulting in enhanced reactivity compared to that of homogeneous solutions. The control of photoreactions by the physical and chemical properties of membranes, such as fluidity and phase separation, has also been well studied in recent years. In contrast, it remains difficult to control chemical reactions via dynamic membrane deformation. Here, we report on the control of excitation energy transfer reaction utilizing red blood cell ghosts (RBCGs), which have asymmetric lipid membranes and inherent and unique deformability, as reactors. RBCGs, in which donor and acceptor molecules were chemically conjugated to a two&#8208;dimensional cytoskeleton located beneath the inner membrane, exhibited energy transfer, and their efficiency varied depending on the amount and ratio of donor and acceptor modifications, as confirmed by experimental and theoretical analysis. Furthermore, the KCl concentration&#8208;induced RBCG shrinkage enhanced the energy transfer efficiency. Our proposed method is expected to facilitate the construction of photoreaction systems that can be controlled via membrane deformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Assessing the Role of BN&#8208;Embedding Position in B2N2&#8208;Perylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Incorporating heteroatoms can effectively modulate the molecular optoelectronic properties. However, the fundamental understanding of BN doping effects in BN&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is underexplored, lacking rational guidelines to modulate the electronic structures through BN units for advanced materials. Herein, a concise synthesis of novel B2N2&#8208;perylenes with BN doped at the bay area is achieved to systematically explore the doping effect of BN position on the photophysical properties of PAHs. The shift of BN position in B2N2&#8208;perylenes alters the &#960; electron conjugation, aromaticity and molecular rigidness significantly, achieving substantially higher electron transition abilities than those with BN doped in the nodal plane. It is further clarified that BN position dominates the photophysical properties over BN orientation. The revealed guideline here may apply generally to novel BN&#8208;PAHs, and aid the advancement of BN&#8208;PAHs with highly&#8208;emissive performance.</dc:description>

         <title>A New Look at the Mechanism of Cocrystal Formation and Coformers Exchange in Processes Forced by Mechanical and/or Thermal Stimuli &#8211; ex situ and in&#8197;situ Studies of Low&#8208;Melting Eutectic Mixtures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first attempt to explain in&#8197;situ with atomic resolution the multi&#8208;stage mechanism of cocrystals formation in various devices used for their preparation (ball mills, hot stage melting, MAS rotors).







Abstract
Three different devices: ball mill, hot stage melting, and magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR rotor were used for the preparation of ethenzamide (ET) cocrystals with glutaric acid (GLU), ethylmalonic acid (EMA) and maleic acid (MAL) as coformers. In each case, well&#8208;defined binary systems (ET:EMA, ET:GLU, ET:MAL) were obtained. The common features of the two solvent free methods of cocrystal formation (grinding, melting) are presented on the basis of arguments obtained by solid state NMR spectroscopy. Thermal analysis (Differential Scanning Calorimetry) proved that the eutectic phase arises over a wide range of molar ratios of components for each of the binary systems. NMR techniques, supported by theoretical calculations, allowed to provide details about the pathway of the reaction mechanism with atomic accuracy. It was found that the formation of ET cocrystals is a complex process that requires five steps. Each step has been recognized and described. Variable temperature 1D and 2D MAS NMR experiments allowed to track physicochemical processes taking place in a molten state. Moreover, it was found that in a multicomponent mixture consisting of all four components, ET, EMA, GLU, and MAL, ET in the molten phase behaves as a specific selector choosing only one partner to form binary cocrystals according to energy preferences. The process of exchange of coformers in binary systems during grinding, melting, and NMR measurements is described. The stabilization energies (Estab) and molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) maps computed for the cocrystals under discussion and their individual components rationalize the selection rules and explain the relationships between individual species.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks as Electrode Materials for Alkali Metal&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic framework (COFs) is a promising electrode material, which has the advantages of strong covalent bond network, adjustable pore structure, large specific surface area, excellent thermal stability. The effective strategies (introducing active sites, constructing conjugated structures, carbon composites, etc.) for improving the conductivity and stability of COFs materials are summarized, and the current challenges and future design directions of COFs electrodes are discussed.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a class of porous crystalline polymeric materials constructed by linking organic small molecules through covalent bonds. COFs have the advantages of strong covalent bond network, adjustable pore structure, large specific surface area and excellent thermal stability, and have broad application prospects in various fields. Based on these advantages, rational COFs design strategies such as the introduction of active sites, construction of conjugated structures, and carbon material composite, etc. can effectively improve the conductivity and stability of the electrode materials in the field of batteries. This paper introduces the latest research results of high&#8208;performance COFs electrode materials in alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs, SIBs, PIBs and LSBs) and other advanced batteries. The current challenges and future design directions of COFs&#8208;based electrode are discussed. It provides useful insights for the design of novel COFs structures and the development of high&#8208;performance alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Rational Design and Biological Application of Hybrid Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, we primarily summarized the hybridizations between four classical fluorophores, namely xanthene, cyanine, coumarin and BODIPY. We provided an overview of the connection modes between conjugated and non&#8208;conjugated hybrid fluorophores. Hybrid fluorophores have played an irreplaceable role in the fields of biological detection, diagnosis and treatment.







Abstract
Fluorophores are considered powerful tools for not only enabling the visualization of cell structures, substructures, and biological processes, but also making for the quantitative and qualitative measurement of various analytes in living systems. However, most fluorophores do not meet the diverse requirements for biological applications in terms of their photophysical and biological properties. Hybridization is an important strategy in molecular engineering that provides fluorophores with complementarity and multifunctionality. This review summarizes the basic strategies of hybridization with four classes of fluorophores, including xanthene, cyanine, coumarin, and BODIPY with a focus on their structure&#8208;property relationship (SPR) and biological applications. This review aims to provide rational hybrid ideas for expanding the reservoir of knowledge regarding fluorophores and promoting the development of newly produced fluorophores for applications in the field of life sciences.

         <title>On Demand Synthesis of C3&#8722;N1&#8217; Bisindoles by a Formal Umpolung Strategy: First Total Synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;Rivularin A</title>

On Demand Synthesis of C3&#8722;N1&#8217; Bisindoles!!: Unified synthesis of C3&#8722;N1&#8217; bisindolines, indole/indolines, and bisindoles was accomplished by a formal umpolung strategy. Good functional group tolerance enabled the first total synthesis of polybrominated C3&#8722;N1&#8217; bisindole alkaloid rivularin A.







Abstract
In this work, a straightforward synthesis of C3&#8722;N1&#8217; bisindolines is achieved by a formal umpolung strategy. The protocols were tolerant of a wide variety of substituents on the indole and indoline ring. In addition, the C3&#8722;N1&#8217; bisindolines could be converted to C3&#8722;N1&#8217; indole&#8208;indolines and C3&#8722;N1&#8217;&#8208;bisindoles. Also, we have successfully synthesized (&#177;)&#8208;rivularin A through a biomimetic late&#8208;stage tribromination as a key step.

         <title>Visible&#8208;light driven control over oligomerization of triple and quadruply hydrogen&#8208;bonded ditopic self&#8208;assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymers offer tremendous potential to produce new &#8220;smart&#8221; materials however, there remains a need to develop systems that are responsive to external stimuli. In this work visible&#8208;light responsive hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular polymers comprising photoresponsive supramolecular synthons (I&#8208;III) consisting of two hydrogen bonding motifs (HBMs) connected by a central ortho&#8208;tetrafluorinated azobenzene have been characterized by DOSY NMR and viscometry. Comparison of different hydrogen&#8208;bonding motifs reveals that assembly in the low and high concentration regimes is strongly influenced by the strength of association between the HBMs. I, Incorporating a triply hydrogen&#8208;bonded heterodimer, was found to exhibit concentration dependent switching between a monomeric pseudo&#8208;cycle and supramolecular oligomer through intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions between the HBMs. II, Based on the same photoresponsive scaffold, and incorporating a quadruply hydrogen&#8208;bonded homodimer was found to form a supramolecular polymer which was dependent upon the ring&#8208;chain equilibrium and thus dependent upon both concentration and photochemical stimulus. Finally, III, incorporating a quadruply hydrogen&#8208;bonded heterodimer represents the first photoswitchable AB type hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular polymer. Depending on the concentration and photostationary state, four different assemblies dominate for both monomers II and III, demonstrating the ability to control supramolecular assembly and physical properties triggered by light.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Reactivities of tert&#8208;Butyllithium by the Addition of Stoichiometric Amounts of Tetrahydrofuran</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In alkyllithium chemistry the highest reactivity has historically been linked to the smallest degree of aggregation possible. Since tert&#8208;butyllithium is known to form a monomer in tetrahydrofuran solution, using just stoichiometric amounts of the lewis base to selectively form a dimeric species seemed irrational. In this study, we showed a considerable increase of the reactivity of t&#8208;BuLi when using stoichiometric amounts of THF in the non&#8208;polar solvent n&#8208;pentane in order to enable the deprotonation of simple methyl silanes and other low C&#8211;H&#8208;acidic substrates. In this context, we were able to obtain the corresponding aggregates of t&#8208;BuLi with the ligand THF in suspension and as crystalline solids and investigate them by single crystal X&#8208;ray structural analysis, in situ FTIR spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. Furthermore, we were able to explain the enhanced reactivity of t&#8208;BuLi with stoichiometric amounts of THF on the basis of structural features of the bridged dimer obtained under these conditions. With these findings, we present a new target in the aggregation of alkyllithium reagents: the selectively formed &#8220;frustrated&#8221; aggregates!</dc:description>

         <title>Design Strategies toward High&#8208;Utilization Zinc Anodes for Practical Zinc&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous Zn&#8208;metal batteries (AZMBs) hold a promise as the next&#8208;generation energy storage devices due to their higher specific capacity. However, the actual capacity falls far below the requirements of commercial AZMBs due to the inevitable dendritic growth and side reactions on the surface of Zn anode. Reducing the N/P ratio (negative capacity/positive capacity) is an effective method to achieve high energy density. A significant amount of research has been devoted to increasing the cathode loading and specific capacity to achieve the goal of low N/P batteries. Nevertheless, there is currently a lack of comprehensive overview regarding how to enhance the utilization of the Zn anode to balance the cycle life and energy density of AZMBs. In this review, we summarize the challenges faced in achieving high&#8208;utilization Zn anodes and elaborate on the modifying strategies for the Zn anode to lower the N/P ratio. The current research status and future prospects for the practical application of high&#8208;performance AZMBs are proposed at the end of the review.</dc:description>

A significant amount of research has been devoted to increasing the cathode loading and specific capacity to achieve the goal of low N/P batteries. Nevertheless, there is currently a lack of comprehensive overview regarding how to enhance the utilization of the Zn anode to balance the cycle life and energy density of AZMBs. In this review, we summarize the challenges faced in achieving high-utilization Zn anodes and elaborate on the modifying strategies for the Zn anode to lower the N/P ratio. The current research status and future prospects for the practical application of high-performance AZMBs are proposed at the end of the review.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Donor&#8208;Acceptor Interactions Enhanced Colorimetric Sensors for Both Acid and Base Vapor Based on Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>

Imine&#8208;based COFs with spatial&#8208;distribution&#8208;defined D&#8208;A structures are successfully synthesized and exhibit simultaneous sensing ability towards both acidic and alkaline vapors.







Abstract
Due to the high surface area and uniform porosity of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), they exhibit superior properties in capturing and detecting even trace amounts of gases in the air. However, the COFs materials that possess dual detected functionality are still less reported. Here, an imine&#8208;based COF containing thiophene as a donor and triazine as an acceptor to form spatial&#8208;distribution&#8208;defined D&#8208;A structures was prepared. D&#8208;A system between thiophene and triazine facilitates the charge transfer process during the protonation process of the imine and the triazine units. The obtained COF exhibits simultaneous sensing ability toward both acidic and alkaline vapors with obvious colorimetric sensing functionality.

         <title>A Green Environmental Protection Photocatalytic Molecular Reactor for Aerobic Oxidation of Sulfide to Sulfoxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we designed a novel PDI&#8208;based Zr&#8208;MOF as a photocatalytic molecular reactor for the solid&#8208; and liquid&#8208;phase photocatalytic oxidation of sulfur ethers to sulfoxides. High yields and excellent selectivity and recyclability were demonstrated, which provide a basis for further investigation of the mechanism of action of PDI&#8208;MOF in other photocatalytic reactions.







Abstract
The design and synthesis of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) as photocatalytic molecular reactors for varied reactions have drawn great attention. In this work, we designed a novel photoactive perylenediimides&#8208;based (PDI) carboxylate ligand N,N&#8217;&#8208;di(3&#8217;,3&#8221;,5&#8217;,5&#8221;&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl))&#8208;1,2,6,7&#8208;tetrachloroperylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic acid diimide (Cl&#8208;PDI&#8208;TA) and use it to successfully synthesize a novel Zr(IV)&#8208;based MOF 1 constructed from [Zr6O8(H2O)8]8+ clusters bridged by Cl&#8208;PDI&#8208;TA ligands. Structural analysis revealed that Zr&#8208;MOF 1 manifests a 3D framework with (4,8)&#8208;connected csq topology and possesses triangular channels of ~17&#8197;&#197; and mesoporous hexagonal channels of ~26&#8197;&#197; along c&#8208;axis. Moreover, the synthesized Zr&#8208;MOF 1 exhibits visible&#8208;light absorption and efficient photoinduced free radical generation property, making it a promising photocatalytic molecular reactor. When Zr&#8208;MOF 1 was used as a photocatalyst for the aerobic oxidation of sulfides under irradiation of visible light, it could afford the corresponding sulfoxides with high yield and selectivity. Experimental results demonstrated that the substrate sulfides could be fixed in the pores of 1 and directly transformed to the products sulfoxides in the solid state. Furthermore, the mechanism for the photocatalytic transformation was also investigated and the results revealed that the singlet oxygen (1O2) and superoxide radical (O2&#8901;&#8722;) generated by the energy transfer and electron transfer from the photoexcited Zr&#8208;MOF to oxidants were the main active species for the catalytic reactions. This work offers a perceptive comprehension of the mechanism in PDI&#8208;based MOFs for further study on photocatalytic reactions.

         <title>NHC&#8208;Stabilized Mixed Group 13/14/15 Element Hydrides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions of the NHC&#8208;stabilized compound IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH2BH2OTf with NaPH2 were carried out. Hereby, mixtures of isomers of the unprecedented parent hydride adducts IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH2BH2PH2 and IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH2GeH2PH2 were isolated in different ratios in favour of the latter isomer, depending on the reaction conditions. Subsequent reactions of these isomers yielded the borane adducts IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH2BH2PH2BH3 and IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH2GeH2PH2BH3 as well as the cyclohexyl&#8208;like anion [PHGeH2BH2PH2BH2GeH2]&#8211;.







Abstract
The syntheses of novel N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) adducts of group 13, 14 and 15 element hydrides are reported. Salt metathesis reactions between NaPH2 and IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH2BH2OTf (1) (IDipp=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) led to mixtures of the two isomers IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH2BH2PH2 (2&#8201;a) and IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH2GeH2PH2 (2&#8201;b); by altering the reaction conditions an almost exclusive formation of 2&#8201;b was achieved. Attempts to purify mixtures of 2&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b by re&#8208;crystallization from THF afforded a salt [IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH2BH2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;IDipp][PHGeH2BH2PH2BH2GeH2] (4) that contains the novel anionic cyclohexyl&#8208;like inorganic heterocycle [PHGeH2BH2PH2BH2GeH2]&#8722;. In addition, the borane adducts IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH2BH2PH2BH3 (3&#8201;a) and IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH2GeH2PH2BH3 (3&#8201;b) as even longer chain compounds were obtained from reactions of 2&#8201;a/2&#8201;b with H3B&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;SMe2 and were studied by NMR spectroscopy. Accompanying DFT computations give insight into the mechanism and energetics associated with 2&#8201;a/2&#8201;b isomerization as well as their decomposition pathways.

         <title>Constructing Lanthanide&#8208;Organic Complexes for X&#8208;ray Scintillation and Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The judicious synergy between lanthanide cations and organic ligands affords two photoluminescent and radioluminescent organic&#8208;inorganic hybrids, Eu&#8208;bppCOO&#8208;1 and Tb&#8208;bppCOO&#8208;2. Owing to its lower detection limit of 4.06&#8197;&#956;Gy&#8201;s&#8722;1 and excellent radiation stability, Tb&#8208;bppCOO&#8208;2 was fabricated into a flexible scintillation film featuring a high spatial image resolution of 7&#8197;lp&#8201;mm&#8722;1.







Abstract
The photoluminescent properties of lanthanide complexes have been thoroughly investigated; however, there have been much fewer studies showcasing their potential use in ionizing radiation detection. In this work, we delve into the photo&#8208; and radio&#8208;induced luminescence of a series of lanthanide&#8208;bearing organic&#8208;inorganic hybrids and their potential as a platform for X&#8208;ray scintillation and imaging. The judicious synergy between lanthanide cations and 2,6&#8208;di(1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)isonicotinate (bppCOO&#8722;) ligands affords six new materials with three distinct structures. Notably, Eu&#8208;bppCOO&#8208;1 and Tb&#8208;bppCOO&#8208;2 display sharp fingerprint X&#8208;ray&#8208;excited luminescence (XEL), the intensities of which can be linearly correlated with the X&#8208;ray dose rates over a broad dynamic range (0.007&#8211;4.55&#8197;mGy&#8201;s&#8722;1). Moreover, the X&#8208;ray sensing efficacies of Eu&#8208;bppCOO&#8208;1 and Tb&#8208;bppCOO&#8208;2 were evaluated, showing that Tb&#8208;bppCOO&#8208;2 features a lower detection limit of 4.06&#8197;&#956;Gy&#8201;s&#8722;1 compared to 14.55&#8197;&#956;Gy&#8201;s&#8722;1 of Eu&#8208;bppCOO&#8208;1. Given the higher X&#8208;ray sensitivity and excellent radiation stability of Tb&#8208;bppCOO&#8208;2, we fabricated a flexible scintillator film for X&#8208;ray imaging by embedding finely ground Tb&#8208;bppCOO&#8208;2 in the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) polymer. The resulting scintillator film can be utilized for high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging with a spatial resolution of approximately 7&#8197;lp&#8201;mm&#8722;1.

         <title>Investigating the Structure&#8208;property Relationships of Two Cd&#8208;based Hybrid Multifunctional Compounds with High Tc, Bright Fluorescence and Wide Band&#8208;gap</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two Cd&#8208;based hybrid multifunctional compounds with dual&#8208;stable behavior in dielectric, high transition temperature and bright fluorescence were reported. Then, investigated the impact of substituent carbon chain length (methyl to butyl), structural rigidity (C&#8722;C to C&#8722;F), and halide framework (Cl to I) on fluorescent properties.







Abstract
Organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid multifunctional materials have shown significant application in lighting and sensor fields, owing to their prominent performance and diversity structures. Herein, we synthesized two multifunctional compounds: (propyl&#8208;quinuclidone)2CdBr4 (1) and (F&#8208;butyl&#8208;quinuclidone)2CdBr4 (2). By introducing light&#8208;emitting organic cation with flexible long chain, 1 and 2 exhibit excellent transition properties and bright blue&#8208;white fluorescence. Then, combine fluorescence lifetime and first&#8208;principal calculation, providing evidence for the electron transfer emission. Subsequently, investigated the impact of substituent carbon chain length (methyl to butyl), structural rigidity (C&#8722;C to C&#8722;F) and halide framework (Cl to I) on the fluorescence properties. Results indicate that Cd&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cd distance and structural rigidity play an important role in fluorescence. Overall, our research provides valuable insight and example for chemical modifications enhance compound performance.

         <title>Synthesis and Modular Reactivity of Low Valent Al/Zn Heterobimetallics Supported by Common Monodentate Amides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent advances on low valent main group metal chemistry have shown the excellent potential of heterobimetallic complexes derived from Al(I) to promote cooperative small molecule activation processes. A signature feature of these complexes is the use of bulky chelating ligands which act as spectators providing kinetic stabilization to their highly reactive Al&#8208;M bonds. Breaking new ground in this field, here we report the synthesis of novel unsupported Al/Zn bimetallics prepared by the selective formal insertion of AlCp* into the Zn&#8208;N bond of the utility zinc amides ZnR2&#160;(R = HMDS, hexamethyldisilazide; or TMP, 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidide). By systematically assessing the reactivity of the new [(R)(Cp*)AlZn(R)] bimetallics towards carbodiimides, structural and mechanistic insights have been gained on their ability to undergo insertion in their Zn&#8208;Al bond. Disclosing a dramatic ligand effect, when R = TMP, an isomerization process can be induced giving [(TMP)2AlZn(Cp*)] which displays a special reactivity towards carbodiimides and carbon dioxide involving both its Al&#8208;N bonds, leaving its Al&#8208;Zn bond untouched.</dc:description>

         <title>Monomeric gold hydrides for carbon dioxide reduction: ligand effect on the reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We analyzed the ligand electronic effect in the reaction between a [LAu(I)H]0/&#8208; hydride species and CO2, leading to a coordinated formate [LAu(HCOO)]0/&#8208;. We explored 20 different ligands, such as carbenes, phosphines and others, carefully selected to cover a wide range of electron&#8208;donor and &#8208;acceptor properties. We included in the study the only ligand, an NHC&#8208;coordinated diphosphene, that, thus far, experimentally demonstrated facile and reversible reaction between the monomeric gold(I) hydride and carbon dioxide. We elucidated the previously unknown reaction mechanism, which resulted to be concerted and common to all the ligands: the gold&#8208;hydrogen bond attacks the carbon atom of CO2 with one oxygen atom coordinating to the gold center. A correlation between the ligand &#963; donor ability, which affects the electron density at the reactive site, and the kinetic activation barriers of the reaction has been found. This systematic study offers useful guidelines for the rational design of new ligands for this reaction, while suggesting a few promising and experimentally accessible potential candidates for the stoichiometric or catalytic CO2 activation.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As promising alternatives to liquid electrolytes, polymer electrolytes attract much research interest recently, but their widespread use is limited by the low ionic conductivity. In this study, we use electrostatic spinning to introduce particles of an ionic conductor into polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers to prepare a porous membrane as the host of gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs). The relevant in&#8208;situ produced GPE performs a high ionic conductivity of 6.0&#215;10&#8208;3 S cm&#8208;1, and a high lithium transfer number of 0.85 at 30 &#176;C, respectively. A symmetrical Li cell with this GPE can cycle stably for 550 h at a current density of 0.5 mA/cm2. While the capacity retention of the NCM|GPE|Li cell is 79.84% after 500 cycles at 2C. Even with an increased cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.5 V, the 1st coulomb efficiency reaches 91.58% with a specific discharge capacity of 213.4 mAh/g. This study provides a viable route for the practical application of high energy density lithium metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Ru(C6H6)}&#8208;Decorating Heteropolymolybdate for Highly Activity Photocatalytic Oxidation of Benzyl Alcohol to Benzaldehyde</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An unclassical structure of {Ru(C6H6)}&#8208;based polyoxometalate, Cs6H4[Te2Mo12O46{Ru(C6H6)}]&#183;16.5H2O (1), has been successfully constructed from {Te2Mo12O46}&#8208;type heteropolymolybdate and {Ru(C6H6)} group, which structure type was discovered for the first time. Compound 1 not only possesses strong light&#8208;harvesting ability, but also exhibits high carrier separation efficiency and lower charge transfer resistance. Under visible light irradiation, compound 1 displayed excellent catalytic activity and circularity in the conversion of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde (yield = 94%; turnover number = 500; turnover frequency = 20.8 h&#8208;1).

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An unclassical structure of {Ru(C6H6)}-based polyoxometalate, Cs6H4[Te2Mo12O46{Ru(C6H6)}]&#183;16.5H2O (1), has been successfully constructed from {Te2Mo12O46}-type heteropolymolybdate and {Ru(C6H6)} group, which structure type was discovered for the first time. Compound 1 not only possesses strong light-harvesting ability, but also exhibits high carrier separation efficiency and lower charge transfer resistance. Under visible light irradiation, compound 1 displayed excellent catalytic activity and circularity in the conversion of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde (yield = 94%; turnover number = 500; turnover frequency = 20.8 h-1). Finally, the electron paramagnetic resonance measurement and energy level matching analysis provide theoretical basis for the derivation of the reaction mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydroxytrifluoroethylation and Trifluoroacetylation Reactions via SET Processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydroxytrifluoroethyl and trifluoroacetyl groups are of utmost importance in biologically active compounds, but methods to tether these motifs to organic architectures have been limited. Typically, the preparation of these compounds relied on the use of strong bases or multistep routes. The renaissance of radical chemistry in photocatalytic, transition metal mediated, and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) processes have allowed the installation of these medicinally relevant fluorinated motifs. This review provides an overview of the methods available for the direct synthesis of hydroxytrifluoroethyl&#8208; and trifluoroacetyl&#8208;derived compounds governed by single&#8208;electron transfer processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Insights into the Mechanism of Neptunium Oxidation to the Heptavalent State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Neptunium can exist in multiple oxidation states, including the rare and poorly understood heptavalent form.&#160;&#160; In this work, we monitored the formation of heptavalent neptunium [Np(VII)O4(OH)2]3&#8208; during ozonolysis of aqueous MOH (M = Li, Na, K) solutions using a combined experimental and theoretical approach. All experimental reactions were closely monitored via absorption and vibrational spectroscopy to follow both the oxidation state and the speciation of neptunium guided by the calculated vibrational frequencies for various neptunium species. The mechanism of the reaction partly involves oxidative dissolution of transient Np(VI) oxide/hydroxide solid phases, the identity of which are dependent on the co&#8208;precipitating counter&#8208;cation Li+/Na+/K+. Additional calculations suggest that the most favorable energetic pathway occurs through the reaction of a [Np(V)O2(OH)4]3&#8208; with the hydroxide radical to form [Np(VI)O2(OH)4]2&#8208;, followed by an additional oxidation with HO&#9679; to create [Np(VII)O4(OH)2]3&#8208;.</dc:description>

         <title>Type&#8208;I photodynamic therapy induced by Pt&#8208;coordination of type&#8208;II photosensitizers into supramolecular complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Platinum supramolecular complexes based on photosensitizers have garnered great interest in photodynamic therapy (PDT) due to Pt (II) centers as chemotherapeutic agents to eliminate tumor cells completely, which greatly improve the antitumor efficacy of PDT. However, in comparison to precursor photosensitizer ligand, the formed platinum supramolecular complexes typically exhibit inferior outcomes in terms of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. How to boost ROS generation in the formed platinum supramolecular complexes for enhanced PDT is an enticing yet highly challenging task. Here we report a Pt&#8208;coordination&#8208;based dimeric photosensitizer complex (Cz&#8208;BTZ&#8208;Py)2Pt(OTf)2. It is found that comparing with photosensitizer ligand Cz&#8208;BTZ&#8208;Py, the formed supramolecular complex exhibit redshifts of absorption wavelength as well as enhanced ROS generation efficiency. Moreover, type&#8208;I ROS generation (O2&#8226;&#8208;) is produced in the formed platinum supramolecular complexes mainly due to a reduced energy gap &#916;EST resulting from exciton coupling between two photosensitizer ligands. And type&#8208;I ROS (O2&#8226;&#8208;) generation significantly amplifies the photodynamic therapy (PDT) outcomes. In vitro evaluation shows excellent photochemotherapy performance of (Cz&#8208;BTZ&#8208;Py)2Pt(OTf)2 nanoparticles. We anticipate this work would provide a novel approach to design type&#8208;I photosensitizers for efficient PDT.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;organic framework&#8208;derived two&#8208;dimensional in&#8208;plane Janus catalysts promoting oxygen electroreduction to hydrogen peroxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) materials were used as the precursor to synthesize carbon based two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Janus architecture composed of In2S3&#8722;In2O3 (In&#8722;S&#8722;O) nanoparticles. The 2D in&#8208;plane Janus catalysts has exhibited excellent electrochemical performances promoting oxygen electroreduction to hydrogen peroxide, owning to its abundant electrochemical active sites and large specific surface area.







Abstract
We use MOFs material as precursor to synthesize carbon based two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials loaded with In2S3&#8722;In2O3 (In&#8722;S&#8722;O) nanoparticles. The In&#8722;S&#8722;O nanoparticles have exhibited Janus architecture composed of two compounds with different crystal structures that are combined in&#8208;plane on 2D carbon material surface. The excellent properties of this in&#8208;plane Janus material include 2D nanoarchitecture and its Janus properties formed by combining two different crystal structures. It has exhibited excellent electrochemical performances due to its abundant electrochemical active sites and large specific surface area. According to experiments, the electron transfer number of the material for two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction is about 2.4, and the hydrogen peroxide yield is 32&#8197;mg/h&#8201;cm2. In the further test of liquid flow electrolytic cell, the yield can reach up to 172&#8197;mg/h&#8201;cm2.

         <title>Hole&#8208;Transporting Materials based on Oligo(hetero)aryls with a Naphthodithiophene Core &#8211; Succinct Synthesis by Twofold Direct C&#8722;H Olefination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H cross&#8208;dehydrogenative couplings (direct C&#8722;H olefinations) are used as key step to access small&#8208;molecule hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs). NDT core&#8208;based HTMs incorporating additional olefins as &#960;&#8208;spacers substantially improve the PCE of perovskite solar cells of up to 17.2&#8201;%.







Abstract
This work demonstrated the first synthetic application of direct C&#8722;H olefinations in the step&#8208;saving preparation of various hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTM) for efficient perovskite solar cells (PSC). Cross&#8208;dehydrogenative couplings of naphthodithiophene (NDT) with vinyl arenes under palladium&#8208;catalysis facilely generated various new oligo(hetero)aryls with internal alkenes. Reaction conditions were optimized, which gave the product isolated yields of up to 71&#8201;% with high (E)&#8208;stereoselectivity. These readily accessible NDT core&#8208;based small molecules involving olefin as &#960;&#8208;spacers displayed immediate power conversion efficiencies of up to 17.2&#8201;% without a device oxidation process that is required for the commercially available spiro&#8208;OMeTAD and most other existing HTMs while fabricated in corresponding PSC devices.

         <title>Reactivity of Frustrated Lewis Pair: Carbocation versus Radical Intermediates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extensive DFT calculations show that both radical HCAr2&#8901; and carbocation HCAr2+ are thermally accessible from the bulky phosphonium Mes3P&#8722;CHAr2+, which are further kinetically favored by HCAr2&#8901; radical self&#8208;dimerization and by nucleophilic alkene trapping, respectively.







Abstract
Recent reports of radical formation within frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) suggested that single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) could play an important role in their chemistry especially for C&#8722;C coupling. In sharp contrast, our extensive dispersion&#8208;corrected DFT calculations show that although reactive benzhydryl radical along with phosphine radical cation species can be kinetically generated from bulky phosphines and benzhydryl cation, direct P&#8722;C hetero&#8208;coupling may lead to bulky phosphonium cation as reactive carbocation transfer reagents to styrene substrates, which is kinetically much more favorable than the recently proposed radical C&#8722;C coupling between benzhydryl radical and styrene. Similarly, meta&#8208;stable radical cation Mes3P+&#8901; salt is also kinetically accessible via SET reactions of Mes3P and B(C6F5)3 with 0.5 equivalent of p&#8208;O2C6Cl4.

         <title>Construction of Multifunctional Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoactive TAPA&#8722;BPy&#8722;COF and its metalated Pd@TAPA&#8722;BPy&#8722;COF, which can both serve as the efficient reusable photocatalysts for photocatalytic applications, are reported.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have recently drawn intense attention due to their potential applications in photocatalysis. Herein, we report a multifunctional COF which consists of triphenylamine (TPA) and 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (2, 2&#8242;&#8208;bipy) entities. The obtained TAPA&#8722;BPy&#8722;COF is a heterogeneous photocatalyst and can efficiently catalyze the oxidative coupling of thiols to disulfides. In addition, TAPA&#8722;BPy&#8722;COF can be further metalated by Pd(II) via 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipy&#8722;metal coordination. The generated Pd@TAPA&#8722;BPy&#8722;COF can highly promote photocatalytic synthesis of 3&#8208;cyanopyridines via cascade addition/cyclization of arylboronic acids with &#947;&#8208;ketodinitriles in heterogeneous way. This work has demonstrated the way for the rational design and preparation of more efficient photoactive COFs for photocatalysis.

         <title>A Torquoselective Thermal 6&#960;&#8208;Electrocyclization Approach to 1,4&#8208;Cyclohexadienes via Solvent&#8208;Aided Proton Transfer: Experimental and Theoretical Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The thermal 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization of hexatriene typically delivers 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene (1,3&#8208;CHD). However, there is only limited success in directly synthesizing 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene (1,4&#8208;CHD) using such an approach, probably due to the difficulty in realizing thermally&#8208;forbidden 1,3&#8208;hydride shift after electrocyclic ring closure. The present study shows that by heating (2E,4E,6E)&#8208;hexatrienes bearing ester or ketone substituents at the C1&#8208;position in a mixture of toluene/MeOH or EtOH (2:1) solvents at 90&#8208;100 &#176;C, 1,4&#8208;CHDs can be selectively synthesized. This is achieved through a torquoselective disrotatory 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclic ring closure followed by a proton&#8208;transfer process. The success of this method depends on the polar protic solvent&#8208;assisted intramolecular proton transfer from 1,3&#8208;CHD to 1,4&#8208;CHD, which has been confirmed by deuterium&#8208;labeling experiments. There are no reports to date for such a solvent&#8208;assisted isomerization. Density functional theory (DFT) studies have suggested that forming 1,3&#8208;CHD and subsequent isomerization is a thermodynamically feasible process, regardless of the functional groups involved. Two possible successive polar solvent&#8208;assisted proton&#8208;transfer pathways have been identified for isomerization.</dc:description>

         <title>Atroposelective Chan&#8208;Evans&#8208;Lam Amination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthetic control of atropoisomerism along C&#9472;N bonds is a major challenge, and methods that allow C&#9472;N atroposelective bond formation are rare. This is a problem because each atropoisomer can feature starkly differentiated biological properties. Yet, among the three most practical and applicable classical amination methods available: 1) the Cu&#8208;catalyzed Ullmann&#8208;Goldberg reaction, 2) the Pd&#8208;catalyzed Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig reaction, and 3) the Cu&#8208;catalyzed Chan&#8208;Evans&#8208;Lam reaction, none has truly been rendered atroposelective at the newly formed C&#9472;N bond. The first ever Chan&#8208;Evans&#8208;Lam atroposelective amination is herein described with a simple copper catalyst and newly designed PyrOx chiral ligand.

This is a problem because each atropoisomer can feature starkly differentiated biological properties. Yet, among the three most practical and applicable classical amination methods available: 1) the Cu-catalyzed Ullmann-Goldberg reaction, 2) the Pd-catalyzed Buchwald-Hartwig reaction, and 3) the Cu-catalyzed Chan-Evans-Lam reaction, none has truly been rendered atroposelective at the newly formed C&#9472;N bond. The first ever Chan-Evans-Lam atroposelective amination is herein described with a simple copper catalyst and newly designed PyrOx chiral ligand. This method should find important applications in asymmetric synthesis, in particular for medicinal chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Ervaoffine J and K</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:&#160;Herein, we describe the total synthesis of ervaoffine J &amp; K from a central intermediate. Ervaoffine J was synthesized in eight steps in 14% yield. Our strategy features an aerobic Winterfeldt oxidation to introduce the 4&#8208;quinolone moeity. Ervaoffine K was produced in ten steps and 10% yield. The synthesis leveraged (bromodifluoromethyl)&#8208;trimethylsilane&#160;to induce a regioselective von Braun&#8208;type C&#8208;N bond fragmentation. This C&#8208;N bond cleavage unveiled the tetrasubstituted all&#8208;syn&#160;cyclohexane core of ervaoffine K and enabled the completion of its synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Orientation of Liquid Crystals Inside Micropores of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Having Thermoresponsivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the aim of controlling the orientation of liquid crystals (LCs) toward realizing external stimuli&#8211;responsive materials with tunable functionalities, we synthesized a composite of LCs and metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) by filling LCs into the pores of MOFs (LC@MOFs) for the first time. The included LCs interact with the MOFs through coordination bonds between the cyano groups of the LCs and the metal ions of the MOFs, enabling the orientation of the LC molecules inside the pores of the MOFs and the realization of birefringence of LC@MOFs. The three&#8208;dimensional nanometer interstice frameworks maintained the LC orientation even at temperatures much higher than the isotropic phase transition temperature of bulk LCs. Furthermore, the orientational state changed upon heating or cooling, inducing temperature&#8208;dependent birefringence. This study provides a new approach to the development of stimuli&#8211;responsive optical materials and stimuli&#8211;responsive MOFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Charge&#8208;Assisted Ionic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks: Designable and Stabilized Multifunctional Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are a class of crystalline framework materials assembled by hydrogen bonds. HOFs have the advantages of high crystallinity, mild reaction conditions, good solution processability, and reproducibility. Coupled with the reversibility and flexibility of hydrogen bonds, HOFs can be assembled into a wide diversity of crystalline structures. Since the bonding energy of hydrogen bonds is lower than that of ligand and covalent bonds, the framework of HOFs is prone to collapse after desolventisation and the stability is not high, which limits the development and application of HOFs. In recent years, numerous stable and functional HOFs have been developed by &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, highly interpenetrated networks, charge&#8208;assisted, ligand&#8208;bond&#8208;assisted, molecular weaving, and covalent cross&#8208;linking. Charge&#8208;assisted ionic HOFs introduce electrostatic attraction into HOFs to improve stability while enriching structural diversity and functionality. In this paper, we review the development, the principles of rational design and assembly of charge&#8208;assisted ionic HOFs, introduces the different building block construction modes of charge&#8208;assisted ionic HOFs. Highlight the applications of charge&#8208;assisted ionic HOFs in gas adsorption and separation, proton conduction, biological applications, etc., and prospects for the diverse design of charge&#8208;assisted ionic HOFs structures and multifunctional applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Aerobic Asymmetric Allylic C&#8208;H Alkylation by Synergistic Chiral Primary Amine&#8208;Palladium&#8208;Hydroquinone Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A synergistic chiral primary amine/palladium /p&#8208;hydroquinone catalysis was developed to facilitate oxidative asymmetric allylic C&#8208;H alkylation under aerobic conditions. The ternary synergistic catalysis enables a facile allylic C&#8208;H activation and alkylation with oxygen so that stoichiometric utilization of benzoquinone can be avoided. The identified optimal catalytic system allows for terminal addition to allyl arenes with &#945;&#8208;branched &#946;&#8208;ketocarbonyls to afford allylic adducts bearing all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers with high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity. This work provides new insights for further studies on the aerobically oxidative C&#8208;H alkylation reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>&#8220;Covalent&#8208;Disassembly&#8221;&#8208;Based Approaches For Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The detection of analytes with small molecular probes is crucial for the analysis and understanding of chemical, medicinal, environmental and biological situations as well as processes. Classic detection approaches rely on the concept of molecular recognition and bond formation reactions. Bond breakage reactions have been less explored in similar contexts. This concept article introduces metal&#8208;salen and metal&#8208;imine complexes as &#8220;covalent&#8208;disassembly&#8221;&#8208;based (DB)&#8208;probes for detecting polyoxophosphates, thiols, amino acids, HCN and changes in pH. It discusses the roles, importance and combinations of structurally functionalized molecular building blocks in the construction of DB&#8208;probes. Applications of optimized DB&#8208;probes for analyte detection in live cells and foodstuff are also discussed. Furthermore, the mechanism of the disassembly of a Fe(III)&#8208;salen probe upon pyrophosphate binding is presented. Extraordinary selectivity for this analyte was achieved by a multistep disassembly sequence including an unprecedented structural change of the metal complex (i.e. &#8220;induced&#8208;fit&#8221; principle). Design principles of probes for sensing applications following the &#8220;covalent&#8208;disassembly&#8221; approach are summarized, which will help improving current systems, but will also facilitate the development of new DB&#8208;probes for challenging analytic targets.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformational Preferences at the Glycosidic Linkage of Saccharides in Solution as Deduced from NMR Experiments and MD Simulations: Comparison to Crystal Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycans are central to information content and regulation in biological systems. These carbohydrate molecules are active either as oligo&#8208; or polysaccharides, often as glycoconjugates. The conformational preferences and population distributions at the glycosidic torsion angles &#981; and &#968; have been investigated for O&#8208;methyl glycosides of three disaccharides where the substitution takes place at a secondary alcohol. Stereochemical differences at or adjacent to the glycosidic linkage were explored by solution state NMR spectroscopy using one&#8208;dimensional 1H,1H&#8208;NOESY NMR experiments to obtain transglycosidic proton&#8208;proton distances and one&#8208; and two&#8208;dimensional heteronuclear NMR experiments to obtain 3JCH transglycosidic coupling constants related to torsion angles &#981; and &#968;. Computed effective proton&#8208;proton distances from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations showed excellent agreement to experimentally derived distances for the &#945;&#8208;(1&#8594;3)&#8208;linked disaccharides and revealed that for the bimodal distribution at the &#968; torsion angle for the &#945;&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;linked disaccharide experiment and simulation were at variance with each other, calling for further force field developments. The MD simulations disclosed a highly intricate inter&#8208;residue hydrogen bonding pattern for the &#945;&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;linked disaccharide, including a nonconventional hydrogen bond between H5' in the glucosyl residue and O3 in the galactosyl residue, supported by a large downfield 1H NMR chemical shift displacement compared to &#945;&#8208;d&#8208;Glcp&#8208;OMe.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermochromic Afterglow from Benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diboronic Acid&#8208;doped Co&#8208;crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The accurate thermosensing requires a minimum impact of autofluorescence and light scattering from the samples. In this study, we discovered that benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diboronic acid (BDBA) doped co&#8208;crystals with trimethylolpropane (TMP) exhibit excellent thermochromic dual phosphorescence properties over a wide temperature range from &#8210;132 to 40&#176;C, despite its simple structure that does not have any donor&#8208;acceptor linkage. The dual phosphorescence was consisted of monomeric benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diboronate (BDBA ester) and aggregation&#8208;stabilized species. With an increase in temperature, the emission intensity from the monomeric state significantly decreased, whereas that originating from the aggregated state remained almost constant owing to the difference in their thermal stabilities. Further investigation revealed that molecular distortions in singlet excited states enable efficient intersystem crossing, causing efficient phosphorescence from the monomeric state of BDBA ester.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel Carbide Nanoparticle Catalyst for Selective Hydrogenation of Nitriles to Primary Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite its unique physicochemical properties, the catalytic application of nickel carbide (Ni3C) in organic synthesis is rare. In this study, we report well&#8208;defined nanocrystalline Ni3C (nano&#8208;Ni3C) as a highly active catalyst for the selective hydrogenation of nitriles to primary amines. The activity of the aluminum&#8208;oxide&#8208;supported nano&#8208;Ni3C (nano&#8208;Ni3C/Al2O3) catalyst surpasses that of Ni nanoparticles. Various aromatic and aliphatic nitriles and dinitriles were successfully converted to the corresponding primary amines under mild conditions (1 bar H2 pressure). Furthermore, the nano&#8208;Ni3C/Al2O3 catalyst was reusable and applicable to gram&#8208;scale experiments. Density functional theory calculations suggest the formation of polar hydrogen species on the nano&#8208;Ni3C surface, which were attributed to the high activity of nano&#8208;Ni3C towards nitrile hydrogenation. This study demonstrates the utility of metal carbides as a new class of catalysts for liquid&#8208;phase organic reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Starfruit&#8208;shaped Zirconium Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: From 3D intermediates to 2D Nanosheet Petals with Enhanced Catalytic Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starfruit&#8208;shaped Zirconium metal&#8208;organic frameworks (SMOF), with edge&#8208;sharing two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanosheet petals, can form spontaneously from the transformation of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) MOF crystals in a solvothermal synthesis. The distinct morphology of SMOF showcases superior catalytic activity in detoxifying G&#8208;type nerve agent and blister agent simulants, surpassing that of its 3D counterparts.







Abstract
We present the fabrication of a novel Starfruit&#8208;shaped metal&#8208;organic framework (SMOF) composed of zirconium and Tetra(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)porphine linkers. The SMOF exhibits a unique morphology with edge&#8208;sharing two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanosheet petals. Our investigation unravels a captivating transformation process, wherein three&#8208;dimensional (3D) shuttle&#8208;shaped MOFs form initially and subsequently evolve into 2D nanosheet&#8208;based SMOF structures. The distinct morphology of SMOF showcases superior catalytic activity in detoxifying G&#8208;type nerve agent and blister agent simulants, surpassing that of its 3D counterparts. This discovery of the 3D&#8208;to&#8208;2D transition growth pathway unlocks exciting opportunities for exploring novel strategies in advanced MOF nanostructure development, not only for catalysis but also for various other applications.

         <title>Hybrid Membrane Composed of Nickel Diselenide Nanosheets with Carbon Nanotubes for Catalytic Conversion of Polysulfides in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid membrane composed of nickel diselenide nanosheets (NSN) modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs) has been succeeded in preparing via hydrothermal and vacuum filtration technology. The three&#8208;dimensional networks of CNTs facilitate the transport of electrons and ions. In this process, NSN acts as catalytic centers, thereby accelerating the redox conversion of polysulfide species remarkably elevating the cycle performance of the battery.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries demonstrate enormous energy density are promising forms of energy storage. Unfortunately, the slow redox kinetics and polysulfides shuttle effect are some of the factors that prevent the its development. To address these issues, the hybrid membrane with combination of nickel diselenide nanosheets modified carbon nanotubes (NSN@CNTs) and utilized Li2S6 catholyte for lithium sulfur battery. The conductive CNTs facilitates fast electronic/ionic transport, while the polarity of NSN as a strong affinity to lithium polysulfides, effectively anchoring them, facilitating the redox conversion of polysulfide species, and effectively diminishing reaction barriers. The cell with NSN@CNTs delivers the first discharge capacity of 1123.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and maintains 786.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 300&#8197;cycles (0.2&#8197;C) at the sulfur loading 5.4&#8197;mg. Its rate capability is commendable, enabling it to sustain a capacity of 559.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 even at a high discharge rate of 2&#8197;C. In addition, its initial discharge capacity can remain 8.33&#8197;mAh even at 10.8&#8197;mg for duration of 100&#8197;cycles. This research indicates the potential application of NSN@CNTs hybrid materials in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.

         <title>Aerobic Catalytic Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling of Furans with Indoles Provides Access to Fluorophores with Large Stokes Shift</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a general cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling between furans and indoles using earth&#8208;abundant metal catalyst FeCl3.6H2O in presence of oxygen. The reaction displayed scalability and aqueous compatibility, thus making it practical, operationally simple, and sustainable. The products were found to possess fluorescence properties with remarkable Stokes&#8217; shift of upto 205&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Sustainability in chemical processes is a crucial aspect in contemporary chemistry with sustainable catalysis as a vital parameter of the same. There has been a renewed focus on utilizing earth&#8208;abundant metal catalysts to expand the repertoire of organic reactions. Furan is a versatile heterocycle of natural origin used for multiple applications. However, it has scarcely been used in cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling. In this work, we have explored the cross&#8208;dehydrogentive coupling of furans with indoles using commonly available, inexpensive FeCl3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6H2O (&lt;0.25&#8197;$/g) as catalyst in the presence of so called &#8216;ultimate oxidant&#8217; &#8211; oxygen, without the need for any external ligand or additive. The reactions were found to be scalable and to work even under partially aqueous conditions. This makes the reaction highly economical, practical, operationally simple and sustainable. The methodology provides direct access to &#960;&#8208;conjugated short oligomers consisting of furan, thiophene and indole. These compounds were found to show interesting fluorescence properties with remarkably large Stokes shift (up to 205&#8197;nm). Mechanistic investigations reveal that the reaction proceeds through chemoselective oxidation of indole by the metal catalyst followed by nucleophilic trapping by furan.

&lt;p&gt;We report a general cross-dehydrogenative coupling between furans and indoles using earth-abundant metal catalyst FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.6H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O in presence of oxygen. The reaction displayed scalability and aqueous compatibility, thus making it practical, operationally simple, and sustainable.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sustainability in chemical processes is a crucial aspect in contemporary chemistry with sustainable catalysis as a vital parameter of the same. There has been a renewed focus on utilizing earth-abundant metal catalysts to expand the repertoire of organic reactions. Furan is a versatile heterocycle of natural origin used for multiple applications. However, it has scarcely been used in cross-dehydrogenative coupling. In this work, we have explored the cross-dehydrogentive coupling of furans with indoles using commonly available, inexpensive FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (&amp;lt;0.25&#8197;$/g) as catalyst in the presence of so called &#8216;ultimate oxidant&#8217; &#8211; oxygen, without the need for any external ligand or additive. The reactions were found to be scalable and to work even under partially aqueous conditions. This makes the reaction highly economical, practical, operationally simple and sustainable. The methodology provides direct access to &#960;-conjugated short oligomers consisting of furan, thiophene and indole. These compounds were found to show interesting fluorescence properties with remarkably large Stokes shift (up to 205&#8197;nm).

         <title>Soft multi&#8208;layer actuators integrated with the functions of electrical energy harvest and storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrating functions such as energy harvesting and storage with actuators to create intelligent actuators has emerged as a growing trend in development. By functionalizing actuation materials, they can take on a range of capabilities including energy harvesting, conversion, and storage. We provide a detailed introduction to smart actuators equipped with these functions, covering design concepts, typical applications, and future prospects.







Abstract
Soft multi&#8208;layer actuators are smart, lightweight, and flexible, which can be used in a wide range of fields such as artificial muscles, advanced medical devices, and wearable devices. The research on the actuation property of the soft actuators has made significant progress, paving the way for the controllable motions of the actuators. However, compared with the intelligence and adaptability of life in nature, these actuators still have the problem of insufficient intelligence. The phenomenon is reflected in a lack of continuous supply of energy. Therefore, it has become a development trend to combine functions such as energy harvesting, storage, and conversion with actuators to build intelligent actuators. This concept presents a synopsis of the advancements made in soft actuators that have been coupled with the capabilities of electrical energy harvesting and storage. The design concepts and typical applications of this soft smart actuators are introduced in detail. Finally, the future research directions and applications of smart actuators are prospected from our perspective.

         <title>Tumor Targeted Cuprous&#8208;Based Nanocomposite as Responsive Cascade Nanocatalyst for Efficient Tumor Synergistic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cascade nanocatalytic reaction system is fabricated. The reasonable combination of the high catalytic efficiency derived from Cu+, in&#8197;situ generation of endogenous H2O2 and consumption of intratumoral glucose induced by GOx, and the upregulation of ROS level evoked by selenocompounds has resulted in the excellent synergistic therapeutic effect in cancer treatment.







Abstract
The single&#8208;functionality of traditional chemodynamic therapy (CDT) reagents usually limits the therapeutic efficacy of cancer treatment. Synergistic nanocomposites that involve cascade reaction provide a promising strategy to achieve satisfactory anticancer effects. Herein, a cuprous&#8208;based nanocomposite (CCS@GOx@HA) is fabricated, which owns the tumor targeting ability and can undergo tumor microenvironment responsive cascade reaction to enhance the tumor therapeutic efficiency significantly. Surface modification of nanocomposite with hyaluronic acid enables the targeted delivery of the nanocomposite to cancer cells. Acid&#8208;triggered decomposition of nanocomposite in cancer cell results in the release of Cu+, Se2&#8722; and GOx. The Cu+ improves the Fenton&#8208;like reaction with endogenous H2O2 to generate highly toxic &#8226;&#8201;OH for CDT. While GOx can not only catalyze the in&#8197;situ generation of endogenous H2O2, but also accelerate the consumption of intratumoral glucose to reduce nutrient supply in tumor site. In addition, Se2&#8722; further improves the therapeutic effects of CDT by upregulating the reactive oxygen species (ROS) in tumor cells. Meanwhile, the surface modification endows the nanocomposite the good water dispersibility and biocompatibility. Moreover, in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo experiments demonstrate satisfactory anti&#8208;cancer therapeutic performance by the synergistic cascade function of CCS@GOx@HA than CDT alone.

         <title>[3+2] Cycloaddition of Alkynyl Boronates and in&#8197;situ Generated Azomethine Ylide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[3+2] cycloaddition of alkynyl boronates and in&#8197;situ generated azomethine ylide is used for the selective scalable synthesis of pyrroline&#8208; and diazabicyclo[3.3.0]octane&#8208;derived boronates (i.&#8201;e., 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 and 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 cycloadducts). The C&#8722;C and C&#8722;heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions of the obtained building blocks illustrate their utility for organic synthesis and drug discovery.







Abstract
Scalable [3+2] cycloaddition of alkynyl boronates and in&#8197;situ generated unstabilized azomethine ylide is reported for the first time. The selective formation of either 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 or 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 cycloaddition products was achieved by carefully optimizing the reaction conditions, mainly by controlling the reactant stoichiometry, catalyst loading, and internal temperature. The developed protocol tolerated many valuable functional groups, including TMS, protected alcohol (as ether or THP derivatives), or aldehyde (as acetal). Further common C&#8722;C and C&#8722;heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions, as well as scaled&#8208;up procedures demonstrate the utility of the prepared compounds as building blocks for organic synthesis and drug discovery.

         <title>Orbital Analysis Captures the Existence of a Mixed&#8208;Valent CuIII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII Active&#8208;Site and its Role in Water&#8208;Assisted Aliphatic Hydroxylation</title>

         <dc:description>The Cu&#8722;O&#8722;Cu core has been proposed as a potential site for methane oxidation in particulate methane monooxygenase. In this work, we used density functional theory (DFT) to design a mixed&#8208;valent CuIII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII species from an experimentally known peroxo&#8208;dicopper complex supported by N&#8208;donor ligands containing phenolic groups. We found that the transfer of two&#8208;protons and two&#8208;electrons from phenolic groups to peroxo&#8208;dicopper core takes places, which results to the formation of a bis&#8208;&#956;&#8208;hydroxo&#8208;dicopper core. The bis&#8208;&#956;&#8208;hydroxo&#8208;dicopper core converts to a mixed&#8208;valent CuIII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII core with the removal of a water molecule. The orbital and spin density analyses unravel the mixed&#8208;valent nature of CuIII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII. We further investigated the reactivity of this mixed&#8208;valent core for aliphatic C&#8722;H hydroxylation. Our study unveiled that mixed&#8208;valent CuIII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII core follows a hydrogen atom transfer mechanism for C&#8722;H activation. An in&#8208;situ generated water molecule plays an important role in C&#8722;H hydroxylation by acting as a proton transfer bridge between carbon and oxygen. Furthermore, to assess the relevance of a mixed&#8208;valent CuIII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII core, we investigated aliphatic C&#8722;H activation by a symmetrical CuII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII core. DFT results show that the mixed&#8208;valent CuIII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII core is more reactive toward the C&#8722;H bond than the symmetrical CuII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII core.</dc:description>

         <title>A Two&#8208;dimensional Metal&#8722;Organic Framework as Promising Cathode for Advanced Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anthraquinone electrode materials are promising candidates for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to the abundance,&#160;high theoretical capacity, and good reversibility of&#160; anthraquinone electrodes. However, the active anthraquinone materials are soluble in organic electrolytes, resulting in a sharp decay of capacity during the charge and discharge processes. Herein, we report on a two&#8208;dimensional calcium anthraquinone 2,3&#8208;dicarboxy metal&#8208;organic framework (2D CaAQDC MOF) fabricated using a simple hydrothermal method. The 2D CaAQDC MOF not only effectively inhibits the dissolution of active electrode substances into the electrolyte, but also promotes the diffusion of lithium ions into the pores of the MOF. When used as a cathode for the LIBs, the resulting CaAQDC electrode delivers a high specific capacity of ~100 mAh&#183;g&#8208;1 at a current density of 50 mA&#183;g&#8208;1 after 200 cycles, demonstrating its good cycle stability. Even at a high current density of 200 mA&#183;g&#8208;1, the CaAQDC electrode exhibits a specific capacity of ~60 mAh&#183;g&#8208;1. The fabricated 2D coordination polymers effectively restrains the dissolution of anthraquinone into the organic electrolyte and enhances the structural stability, which greatly improves the electrochemical performance of anthraquinone. These research results offer a rational molecular design strategy to address the dissolution of this and other active organic electrode materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling of Aliphatic Amines with Alkylboronic Esters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a Cu&#8208;catalyzed oxidative coupling of aliphatic amines with benzylic and aliphatic boronic esters to give high value alkyl amines, products found widely in applications from medicinal chemistry to materials science. This operationally simple reaction, which can be performed on gram scale, runs under mild conditions and exhibits broad functional group tolerance. The terminal oxidant of the reaction is O2 from the air, avoiding the need for additional chemical oxidants. Investigation into the reaction mechanism suggests that the boronic ester is activated by an aminyl radical, formed through oxidation of the amine by the Cu catalyst, to give a key alkyl radical intermediate. To demonstrate its utility and potential for late&#8208;stage functionalization, we showcase the method as the final step in the total synthesis of a TRPV1 antagonist.</dc:description>

         <title>Temperature&#8208;dependent Electrochemical Performance of Ta&#8208;substituted SrCoO3 perovskite for Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing new electrode materials with good temperature&#8208;dependent electrochemical performance has become a great issue for the deployment of hybrid supercapacitors with wide temperature tolerance.&#160;&#160;In this work, a series of Ta&#8208;substituted SrCo1&#8208;xTaxO3&#8208;&#948; (x = 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20) perovskites have been studied as positive electrodes for hybrid supercapacitors in&#160;terms of their structures, elemental valence states and electrochemical performances. Incorporating Ta into SrCoO3&#8208;&#948; perovskite not only stabilizes the crystallite structure but also notably improves electrochemical activities. The SrCo0.95Ta0.05O3&#8208;&#948;@CC delivers the highest specific capacity (Qsp) of 227.91 C g&#8208;1 at 1 A g&#8208;1, which is attributed to the highest oxygen vacancy content and the fastest oxygen diffusion kinetics. The hybrid supercapacitor SrCo0.95Ta0.05O3&#8208;&#948;@CC//AC@CC exhibits a high energy density of 22.82 Wh kg&#8208;1@775.09 W kg&#8208;1 and a stable long&#8208;term cycle life (5000 cycles) with 90.7% capacity retention. As temperature increases from 25 to 85 &#8451;, the capacitance properties are improved at elevated temperatures for both electrode and device due to the increased electrolyte conductivity. The outstanding electrochemical results present that SrCo1&#8208;xTaxO3&#8208;&#948; perovskite holds good prospects for hybrid supercapacitors with wide temperature tolerance.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Fluorine, the tiny robust atom, with its unique features has captured the attention of scientists in recent times, especially in drug discovery with its integration in small molecules, peptides, and proteins. However, studies to understand the &#8216;fluorine effects&#8217; (&#8216;fluorine magic&#8217;) on the conformation of molecules that follow &#8216;beyond the rule of 5&#8217; are in the infancy yet significant in molecular design and function. For the first time, using short hybrid peptide sequence as an appropriate model, we examined the substitution effect (size, stereoelectronic effect, and hydrogen bonding) using X&#8208;ray diffraction 2D&#8208;NMR, and CD studies. The comparative study on their folding patterns with hydrogen&#8208;substituted analogs can provide valuable insights into &#8216;flustrates&#8217; fluorinated substrates&#8217; design.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyoxometalate&#8208;dependent photocatalytic activity of radical&#8208;doped perylenediimide&#8208;based hybrid materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Four radical&#8208;doped PDI&#8208;based crystalline hybrid materials, Cl4&#8208;PDI&#183;SiW12O40 (1), Cl4&#8208;PDI&#183;SiMo12O40 (2), Cl4&#8208;PDI&#183;PW12O40 (3), and Cl4&#8208;PDI&#183;PMo12O40 (4), were attainedby slow diffusion of polyoxometalates (POMs) into acidified Cl4&#8208;PDI solutions. The obtained PDI&#8208;based crystalline hybrid materials not only exhibited prominent photochromism, but also possessed reactive organic radicals under ambient conditions. Furthermore, all hybrid materials could be easily photoreduced to their radical anions (Cl4&#8208;PDI&#8226;&#8210;), and then underwent a second photoexcitation to form energetic excited state radical anions (Cl4&#8208;PDI&#8226;&#8210;*). However, experiments and theoretical calculations demonstrated that the formed energetic Cl4&#8208;PDI&#8226;&#8210;* showed unusual POM&#8208;dependent photocatalytic efficiencies toward the oxidative coupling of amines and the iodoperfluoroalkylation of alkenes; higher photocatalytic efficiencies were found for hybrid materials 1 and 2 compared to 3 and 4. The photocatalytic efficiencies of these hybrid materials are mainly controlled by the energy differences between the SOMO&#8208;2 level of Cl4&#8208;PDI&#8226;&#8210;* and the LUMO level of the POMs.</dc:description>

         <title>Elevating Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Battery Durability through Samarium Oxide/Ketjen Black Modified Separator</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries have garnered significant attention as a promising next&#8208;generation battery technology due to their potential for high energy density. However, their practical application is hampered by slow reaction kinetics and the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfide intermediates. In this context, the authors introduce a pioneering solution in the form of a novel porous carbon nanostructure modified with samarium oxide, denoted as Sm2O3/KB. The material has a highly polar surface, allowing lithium polysulfide to be chemisorbed efficiently. The unsaturated sites provided by the oxygen vacancies of Sm2O3 promote Li2S nucleation, lowering the reaction energy barrier and accelerating Li2S dissolution. The porous structure of Ketjen Black provides a highly conductive channel for electron transport and effectively traps polysulfides. Meanwhile, the batteries with Sm2O3/KB/PP spacers exhibited remarkable electrochemical performances, including a low&#8208;capacity decay rate of only 0.046% for 1000 cycles at 2 C and an excellent multiplicative performance of 624 mAh g&#8208;1 at 3 C. This work opens up a new avenue for the potential use of rare earth&#8208;based materials in lithium&#8208; sulfur batteries.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Lithium-sulfur batteries have garnered significant attention as a promising next-generation battery technology due to their potential for high energy density.

         <dc:description>Novel rhodium&#8208;catalyzed [3+3] annulations of diazoenals and &#945;&#8208;amino ketones has been disclosed here. The reactivity of diazoenals has been switched from carbenoid to vinylogous NH&#8208;insertion by altering acyclic to cyclic &#945;&#8208;aminoketones.&#160;In this direction, we report an efficient strategy to synthesize 1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines (DHPs) and fused 1,4&#8208;oxazines. Mechanistic investigation revealed that the formyl group is necessary for carbenoid [3+3] annulation and the cyclohexyl group is the dictating factor for vinylogous NH&#8208; insertion. The synthetic utility of 1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines was demonstrated by synthesizing piperidine, pyrido[1,2&#8208;a]indole, and 2&#8208;pyridone scaffolds..Further, structural diversification of fused 1,4&#8208;oxazines resulted in the short synthesis of hexahydroquinolin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones, hexahydro quinolines and tetrahydroquinolinones via ring opening rearrangement and a new oxidative deformylation, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Redox Conversion of Formate to CO via Coupling Fe&#8208;Co Layered Double Hydroxides and Au Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Formate has been considered an inactive molecule and thus cannot be further reduced under CO2 reduction conditions, which limits its widespread application as feedstock. Here we present an electrochemical redox conversion of formate to CO through the potential&#8208;dependent generation of carbon dioxide radical anions (CO2&#8226;&#8208;) on Fe&#8208;Co layered double hydroxides (Fe&#8208;Co LDHs) and the subsequent reduction of CO2&#8226;&#8208; to CO on Au catalysts. We present an electrodeposition protocol for the synthesis of Fe&#8208;Co LDHs with precise composition control and find that Fe1Co4 exhibits a promising potential window for CO2&#8208;&#8226; formation between 1.14 and 1.4 V and an optimized potential at 1.24 V at a neutral pH condition. We further determined the formation of CO2&#8226;&#8208; at 1.24 V via electron paramagnetic resonance and CO2 at &gt; 1.4 V through differential electrochemical mass spectrometry. This work provides a redox chemistry route for converting formate into CO through a coupled slit parallel&#8208;plate electrode system.</dc:description>

         <title>Solution and Solvent&#8208;Free Stopper Exchange Reactions for the Preparation of Pillar[5]arene&#8208;containing [2] and [3]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diamine reagents have been used to functionalize a [2]rotaxane building block bearing an activated pentafluorophenyl ester stopper. Upon a first acylation, an intermediate host&#8208;guest complex with a terminal amine function is obtained. Dissociation of the intermediate occurs in solution and acylation of the released axle generates a [2]rotaxane with an elongated axle subunit. In contrast, the corresponding [3]rotaxane can be obtained if the reaction conditions are appropriate to stabilize the inclusion complex of the mono&#8208;amine intermediate and the pillar[5]arene. This is the case when the stopper exchange is performed under mechanochemical solvent&#8208;free conditions. Alternatively, if the newly introduced terminal amide group is large enough to prevent the dissociation, the second acylation provides exclusively a [3]rotaxane. On the other hand, detailed conformational analysis has been also carried out by variable temperature NMR investigations. A complete understanding of the shuttling motions of the pillar[5]arene subunit along the axles of the rotaxanes reported therein has been achieved with the help of density functional theory calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigation of the Chemisorption&#8208;Catalysis Behavior of Sulfur Species on the Electrocatalysts Designed by Co&#8208;regulation Strategy of Anions and Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li&#8208;S batteries possess high energy density and have been one of the most promising energy storage systems. For sulfur cathodes, the electrochemical performance is still seriously hindered by the polysulfide shuttling and sluggish conversion kinetics. It has been demonstrated to be one effective strategy to address the above issues via designing electrocatalysts with robust affinity and catalytic capacity towards polysulfides. However, it is still a great challenge to rapidly and economically discover high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts. Herein, using density functional theory calculation, we studied the chemisorption&#8208;catalysis behavior of sulfur species on a series of electrocatalysts (MCo2X4, M = Co, Zn, Cu, Ni, Fe, and Mn, X = O, S, and Se) to assess the effect of the anions and cations co&#8208;regulation on their electronic structure, chemisorption behavior, and catalytic property. FeCo2Se4 and CuCo2Se4 combined appropriate chemisorption with superior electronic conductivity and sulfur reduction catalytic capacity have been predicted as novel electrocatalysts for high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;S batteries. This study gives theoretical guidance for repaid discovery of high&#8208;efficient electrocatalyst to boost the electrochemical performance of sulfur cathodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Band Gap Semiconductors with Two&#8208; and Three&#8208;Dimensional Triel&#8208;Phosphide Frameworks (Triel = Al, Ga, In)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, several ternary phosphidotrielates and &#8208;tetrelates have been investigated with respect to their very good ionic conductivity, while less focus was pointed towards their electronic structures. Here, we report on a novel series of compounds, in which several members possess direct band gaps. We investigated the known compounds Li3AlP2, Li3GaP2, Li3InP2, and Na3InP2 and describe the synthesis and the crystal structure of novel Na3In2P3. For all mentioned phosphidotrielates reflectance UV&#8208;Vis measurements reveal direct band gaps in the visible light region with decreasing band gaps in the series: Li3AlP2 (2.45 eV), Li3GaP2 (2.18&#160;eV), Li3InP2 (1.99 eV), Na3InP2 (1.37&#160;eV), and Na3In2P3 (1.27&#160;eV). All direct band gaps are confirmed by quantum chemical calculations. The unexpected property occurs despite different structure types. As a common feature all compounds contain EP4 tetrahedra, which share exclusively vertices for E = In and vertices as well as edges for E = Al and Ga. The structure of the novel Na3In2P3 is built up by a polyanionic framework of six&#8208;membered rings of corner&#8208;sharing InP4 tetrahedra. As a result, the newly designed semiconductors with direct band gaps are suitable for optoelectronic applications, and they can provide significant guidance for the design of new functional semiconductors.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoelectrocatalytic Utilization of CO2: A Big Show of Si&#8208;based Photoelectrodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CO2 is a greenhouse gas that contributes to environmental deterioration; however, it can also be utilized as an abundant C1 resource for the production of valuable chemicals. Solar&#8208;driven photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) CO2 utilization represents an advanced technology for the resourcing of CO2. The key to achieving PEC CO2 utilization lies in high&#8208;performance semiconductor photoelectrodes. Si&#8208;based photoelectrodes have attracted increasing attention in the field of PEC CO2 utilization due to their suitable band gap (1.1 eV), high carrier mobility, low cost, and abundance on Earth. There are two pathways to PEC CO2 utilization using Si&#8208;based photoelectrodes: direct reduction of CO2 into small molecule fuels and chemicals, and fixation of CO2 with organic substrates to generate high&#8208;value chemicals. The efficiency and product selectivity of PEC CO2 utilization depends on the structures of the photoelectrodes as well as the composition, morphology, and size of the catalysts. In recent years, significant and influential progress has been made in utilizing Si&#8208;based photoelectrodes for PEC CO2 utilization. This review summarizes the latest research achievements in Si&#8208;based PEC CO2 utilization, with a particular emphasis on the mechanistic understanding of CO2 reduction and fixation, which will inspire future developments in this field.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;CO2 is a greenhouse gas that contributes to environmental deterioration; however, it can also be utilized as an abundant C1 resource for the production of valuable chemicals. Solar-driven photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) CO2 utilization represents an advanced technology for the resourcing of CO2. The key to achieving PEC CO2 utilization lies in high-performance semiconductor photoelectrodes. Si-based photoelectrodes have attracted increasing attention in the field of PEC CO2 utilization due to their suitable band gap (1.1 eV), high carrier mobility, low cost, and abundance on Earth. There are two pathways to PEC CO2 utilization using Si-based photoelectrodes: direct reduction of CO2 into small molecule fuels and chemicals, and fixation of CO2 with organic substrates to generate high-value chemicals. The efficiency and product selectivity of PEC CO2 utilization depends on the structures of the photoelectrodes as well as the composition, morphology, and size of the catalysts. In recent years, significant and influential progress has been made in utilizing Si-based photoelectrodes for PEC CO2 utilization. This review summarizes the latest research achievements in Si-based PEC CO2 utilization, with a particular emphasis on the mechanistic understanding of CO2 reduction and fixation, which will inspire future developments in this field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Fluoride Method: Access to Silver(III) NHC Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have synthesized the first silver(III) carbene complexes, (CF3)3Ag(NHC), by direct reaction of the silver(III) fluoride precursor complex [PPh4][(CF3)3AgF] with different imidazolium salts. This novel methodology circumvents the use of free NHC molecules. The silver(III) carbene complexes thus prepared are unprecedented and show remarkable thermal stabilities. They display square&#8208;planar or square&#8208;pyramidal geometry. Following our calculations, the electronic structure of a model representative complex exhibits Inverse Ligand Field (ILF). The compounds reported herein are synthetic analogues of the elusive difluorocarbene and carbonyl species proposed as intermediates in the acidic decomposition of [Ag(CF3)4]&#8722;. The synthetic procedure reported is envisaged to enable access to carbene complexes of other late transition&#8208;metals in high oxidation states.</dc:description>

         <title>Binding of Acetylated Lysine by Using a Water Soluble Aryl Extended Calix[4]pyrrole</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Post&#8208;translational modifications of lysine in histones, as methylation and acetylation, have well established functions in epigenetics and are emerging as important actors in broader biological regulation. Currently, the detection of acetylated lysine (Kac) in water solution as free amino acid or protein residue remains challenging. Acetylated lysine is a neutral amino acid, and the lack of ion&#8211;dipole interactions causes the decrease in binding affinity displayed by synthetic molecular receptors with respect to the other lysine modifications. Here, we report molecular modeling calculations and 1H NMR experiments to investigate the binding properties of two different calix[4]pyrrole receptors towards Kac. Computational analyses reveal that tetra&#8208;aryl&#8208;extended calix[4]pyrrole (1) preferentially binds the cis&#8208;Kac conformer over the trans one due to steric considerations and more favorable interactions. Experimental 1H NMR titration experiments confirm the formation of a 1:1 complex between receptor 1 and cis&#8208;Kac, with a Ka exceeding 103 M&#8208;1. Conversely, the super&#8208;aryl&#8208;extended calix[4]pyrrole 2 is less efficient in binding Kac, due to unfavorable solvation/desolvation effects, as proven by 1H NMR experiments. Moreover, receptor 1 showed a higher affinity for Kac over other lysine modifications, such as methylated lysines.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyrrole &#946;C&#8208;B&#8208;N Fused Porphyrins: Molecular Structures and Opto&#8208;Electrochemical Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the design, synthesis, structure, and electrochemical study of doubly &#946;C&#8208;B&#8208;N fused Ni(II) porphyrins (1&#8208;trans, 1&#8208;cis, 2&#8208;trans, and 2&#8208;cis). These compounds were synthesized from A2B2 type dipyridyl Ni(II) porphyrins (Ar = Ph for 1a; Ar = C6F5 for 2a) via Lewis base&#8208;directed electrophilic aromatic borylation reactions. The solution state structures of these compounds were established using 1H NMR, 11B NMR, 1H&#8208;1H COSY, 1H&#8208;13C HSQC, and 19F&#8208;13C HSQC NMR techniques. Single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis revealed that 1&#8208;trans, 1&#8208;cis, and 2&#8208;trans adopt ruffled conformations, with alternate meso&#8208;carbons on the opposite sides of the mean porphyrin plane. The Soret bands in the absorption spectra of the B&#8208;N fused molecules are ~40 nm redshifted compared to unfused Ni(II) porphyrin precursors. The B&#8208;N fusion diminishes the redox potential of fused porphyrins. Although 1&#8208;trans and 1&#8208;cis, show four oxidation processes, 2&#8208;trans and 2&#8208;cis showed only three oxidation processes. DFT studies revealed that the tetrahedral geometry of the boron induces a twist in the &#960;&#8208;conjugation, which destabilizes the HOMO and stabilizes the LUMO in 1&#8208;trans, 1&#8208;cis, 2&#8208;trans, and 2&#8208;cis.</dc:description>

         <title>Anthraquinone&#8208;Modified Silica Nanoparticles as Heterogeneous Photocatalyst for the Oxidative Hydroxylation of Arylboronic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, the synthesis and characterization of a heterogeneous photocatalyst based on spherical silica nanoparticles superficially modified with anthraquinone 2&#8208;carboxylic acid (AQ&#8208;COOH) are presented. The nanomaterial was characterized by TEM, SEM, FT&#8208;IR, diffuse reflectance, fluorescence, NMR, DLS, XRD and XPS. These analyses confirm the covalent linking of AQ&#8208;COOH with the NH2 functionality in the nanomaterial and, more importantly, the photocatalyst retains its photophysical properties once bound. The heterogeneous photocatalyst was successfully employed in the aerobic hydroxylation of arylboronic acids to phenols under sustainable reaction conditions. Phenols were obtained in high yields (up to 100 %) with low catalyst loading (3.5 mol %), reaching TOF values of 3.7 h&#8208;1. Using 2&#8208;propanol as solvent at room temperature, the visible light photocatalysis produced H2O2 as a key intermediate to promote the aerobic hydroxylation of arylboronic acids. The heterogeneous photocatalyst was reused at least 5 times, without modification of the nanomaterial structure and morphology. This simple heterogeneous system showed great catalytic activity under sustainable reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>A functional electrolyte containing P&#8208;phenyl diisothiocyanate (PDITC) additive achieves the interphase stability of high nickel cathode in a wide temperature range</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) with high nickel cathode have high specific energy, but as the nickel content in the cathode active material increases, batteries are suffering from temperature limitations, unstable performance, and transition metal dissolution during long cycling. In this work, a functional electrolyte with P&#8208;phenyl diisothiocyanate (PDITC) additive is developed to stabilize the performance of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811)/graphite LIBs over a wide temperature range. Compared to the batteries without the additive, the capacity retention of the batteries with PDITC&#8208;containing electrolyte increases from 23% to 74% after 1400 cycles at 25 &#176;C, and from 15% to 85% after 300 cycles at 45 &#176;C. After being stored at 60 &#176;C, the capacity retention rate and capacity recovery rate of the battery are also improved. In addition, the PDITC&#8208;containing battery has a higher discharge capacity at &#8208;20 &#176;C, and the capacity retention rate increases from 79% to 90% after 500 cycles at 0 &#176;C. Both theoretical calculations and spectroscopic results demonstrate that PDITC is involved in constructing a dense interphase, inhibiting the decomposition of the electrolyte and reducing the interfacial impedance. The application of PDITC provides a new strategy to improve the wide&#8208;temperature performance of the NCM811/graphite LIBs.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A structurally precise hydride&#8208;containing Pt&#8208;doped Cu&#8208;rich nanocluster [PtH2Cu14{S2P(OiPr)2}6(CCPh)6] (1) has been synthesized. It consists of a bicapped icosahedral Cu14 cage that encapsulates a linear PtH2 unit. Upon the addition of two equivalents of CF3COOH to 1, two hydrido clusters are isolated. These clusters are [PtHCu11{S2P(OiPr)2}6(CCPh)4] (2), which is a vertex&#8208;missing Cu11 cuboctahedron encaging a PtH moiety, and [PtH2Cu11{S2P(OiPr)2}6(CCPh)3] (3), a distorted 3,3,4,4,4&#8208;pentacapped trigonal prismatic Cu11 cage enclosing a PtH2 unit. The electronic structure of 2, analyzed by Density Functional Theory, is a 2e superatom. The electrocatalytic activities of 1&#8208;3 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) were compared. Notably, Cluster 2 exhibited an exceptionally excellent HER activity within metal nanoclusters, with an onset potential of &#8211;0.03&#8197;V (at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), a Tafel slope of 39&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, and consistent HER activity throughout 3000&#8197;cycles in 0.5&#8197;M H2SO4. Our study suggests that the accessible central Pt site plays a crucial role in the remarkable HER activity and may provide valuable insights for establishing correlations between catalyst structure and HER activity.</dc:description>
