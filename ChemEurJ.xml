         <title>APE1 Activity is Controlled by Non&#8208;G&#8208;Quadruplex Conformations in Single&#8208; and Double&#8208;Stranded G&#8208;Quadruplex Constructs</title>

         <dc:description>
G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) folding in DNA is inhibitory to AP endonuclease, although the protein still binds well to G4s. Curiously, partially folded G&#8208;rich sequences, possibly transient hairpins, containing AP are very good substrates for cleavage by APE1. Herein, the enzyme activity and G4 folding are studied in single&#8208;stranded vs. duplex contexts.








ABSTRACT
Apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease&#8208;1 (APE1) is a repair enzyme that efficiently cleaves abasic (AP) site damage in duplex DNA. Reports of in vitro activity assays between APE1 and single&#8208;stranded G&#8208;quadruplex (ssG4) reveal significant decreases in the endonuclease activity. Here, we identify that the low yields observed represent cleavage of the noncanonical folds that did not adopt a complete G4 fold. This conclusion is supported through circular dichroism analysis and activity assays analyzing the cleavage rate, folding impact on cleavage, and product inhibition. Studies were performed on AP&#8208;containing ssG4 and duplex&#8208;embedded G4 scaffolds. The CD spectra of a non&#8208;G4 containing potential quadruplex sequence reveal a noncanonical structure. APE1 can cleave an AP in these non&#8208;G4 conformation(s) in high yields comparable to the preferred duplex substrate. There is direct evidence of decreasing APE1 activity with increasing G4 folding in ssG4 and duplex&#8208;G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;duplex (DGD) systems. Also observed is a positional dependency on yield in the non&#8208;G4 DGD scaffolds, but not in the non&#8208;G4 ssG4 scaffolds. In conclusion, our studies provide evidence that APE1 efficiently cleaves noncanonical conformations in G4&#8208;like structures, highlighting the control of secondary structure on APE1 endonuclease activity.

         <title>Synthesis of Fluorocycloparaphenylenes via Macrocyclic Pd Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorocycloparaphenylenes (F&#8208;CPPs) were synthesized through a novel approach involving the formation of macrocyclic palladium complexes. The thermally stable macrocyclic Pd complexes, followed by ligand exchange with Xantphos, afforded various F&#8208;CPPs incorporating tetrafluorophenylene, phenylene, or thienylene units. Optical measurements combined with time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations revealed size&#8208; and structure&#8208;dependent absorption and emission properties.








ABSTRACT
Fluorocycloparaphenylenes (F&#8208;CPPs) are strained, cyclic, &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules with unique electronic and supramolecular properties. Here, we report a novel synthetic approach to create F&#8208;CPPs via the formation of macrocyclic palladium complexes that contain covalent Pd&#8211;C bonds. The thermal stability of the fluorinated biaryl Pd motifs and the reversibility of the formation of Pd&#8211;C bonds enable the self&#8208;assembly of macrocyclic Pd complexes. Subsequent ligand exchange with Xantphos facilitates reductive elimination, yielding various F&#8208;CPPs that incorporate tetrafluorophenylene, phenylene, or thienylene units. A structural analysis revealed that the thienylene&#8208;based F&#8208;CPPs adopt tubular packing structures due to their high fluorine content. Optical measurements and time&#8208;dependent density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations demonstrated size&#8208; and structure&#8208;dependent absorption and emission behavior. This Pd&#8208;mediated synthetic strategy provides a new platform for the synthesis of functionalized CPPs with tailored properties for potential applications in nanomaterials and supramolecular chemistry.

         <title>Magnetic Dynamics and Elongated Coherence of a High&#8208;Spin Mn(II) Qubit Doped into a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates that dilute Mn(II) (&#8764;0.02 mol%) doped into the Zn(II)&#8208;MOF [CH6N3][Zn(HCOO)3] act as high&#8208;spin (S = 5/2) spin qubits, achieving microsecond phase memory times above 50 K&#8212;the first report for Mn(II)&#8208;based systems. Robust hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks suppress relaxation and stabilize the lattice, extending T2. Resonance between MS = &#177;1/2 and quantization axis tilting reveal tunable spin dynamics, highlighting MOFs as promising platforms for high&#8208;spin molecular qubits.








ABSTRACT
Spin qubits are among the most promising candidates for quantum information processing and sensing technologies. Their potential to function even at elevated temperatures makes them particularly attractive for future devices. However, while extensive studies have been carried out on S = 1/2 systems, high&#8208;spin complexes remain much less explored as spin qubit platforms. In this study, we prepared a Zn(II)&#8208;based MOF, [CH6N3][Zn(HCOO)3], doped with trace amounts of Mn(II) ions (S = 5/2, 0.2, and 0.02 mol%). Magnetic measurements under static fields revealed slow relaxation phenomena dominated by direct and Raman&#8208;like processes. Importantly, Q&#8208;band pulsed ESR confirmed quantum coherence between MS = &#177;1/2 sublevels, achieving phase memory times (T2) up to 5.4 &#181;s at 10 K, which is significantly longer than those reported in other Mn(II)&#8208;based systems. Rabi nutation experiments verified coherent spin control and multilevel transitions, while Wigner matrix analysis revealed reorientation of the nuclear quantization axis during spin flips. Notably, coherence persisted above 150 K, attributed to the stabilization provided in the MOF's hydrogen&#8208;bonded lattice. This work represents the first demonstration of high&#8208;spin Mn(II) qubits with measurable coherence at elevated temperatures, underscoring MOFs as versatile and tunable platforms for advancing quantum materials and molecular spin&#8208;based technologies.

         <title>Advances of Covalent Chemical Modifications of RNA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical modification of RNA can endow RNA molecules with novel structures and functions. Enzyme&#8208;and light&#8208;mediated chemical modifications are widely employed for RNA engineering; these strategies are hindered by the complex enzymatic environment and the low light penetration. This review summarizes the field of chemical RNA modifications using diverse approaches, including enzyme, light, and synthetic reactions&#8208;mediated strategies. By introducing the advantages and disadvantages of various RNA modification strategies, this review provides a reference for designing and developing novel RNA modifications to achieve efficient, precise, and spatiotemporally specific RNA modification strategies.








ABSTRACT
Chemical modification of RNA can endow RNA molecules with novel structures and functions, enabling broader clinical application potential. RNA chemical modification is a systematic and controllable engineering approach, particularly at the cellular or tissue level, requiring precise modification strategies to reduce off&#8208;target effects and enhance spatiotemporal controllability. Although enzyme&#8208;and light&#8208;mediated chemical modifications are widely employed for RNA engineering, these strategies are hindered by the complex enzymatic environment within cells and the low light penetration. This review summarizes the field of chemical RNA modifications using diverse approaches, including enzyme, light, and synthetic reactions mediated strategies, such as nucleotide incorporation, light&#8208;induced RNA silencing, bioorthogonal RNA modification, post&#8208;transcriptional modification, and deprotection. By introducing the advantages and disadvantages of various RNA modification strategies, this review provides a reference for designing and developing novel RNA modification to achieve efficient, precise, and spatiotemporally specific RNA modification strategies.

         <title>Photo and Ultrasound Facilitated the Release of Nitric Oxide from [Ru(NO)(QnCN)(Pro)Cl] Isomers: Synthesis, Cytotoxicity, DNA Binding, and Theoretical Simulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two pairs of [Ru(NO)(QnCN)(Pro)Cl] enantiomers were synthesized, where QnCN is 8&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;quinolinecarbonitrile and Pro is L&#8208; or D&#8208; proline. The molecular orbitals and spectra of these isomers were assigned using DFT calculations. Both the photo and the ultrasound facilitate the release of NO from complexes in solution. The complexes induce apoptosis in HeLa cells and arrest the cell cycle at the G2/M phase, binding with CT&#8208;DNA in the order: D1&gt; D2&gt; L1&gt; L2.








ABSTRACT
Four isomers of [Ru(NO)(QnCN)(Pro)Cl] (L1, D1, L2, and D2) were synthesized, where QnCN is 8&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;quinolinecarbonitrile and Pro is L&#8208; or D&#8208; proline. Complexes L1 and D1, L2 and D2 are two pairs of Ru&#8208;centered enantiomers. In L1 and D1, the proline is coordinated trans to NO, whereas in L2 and D2 the 8&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;quinolinecarbonitrile is coordinated trans to NO. The electronic absorption spectra, infrared (IR), and Raman spectra of the isomers were experimentally measured and theoretically assigned. Ultrasound induces the release of NO from the complexes in solution more rapidly, with a shorter t1/2 than light does. Moreover, the cytotoxicity of the isomeric complexes against HeLa cells was evaluated; the IC50 values range from 1 to 10 &#181;M, with selectivity indices exceeding 2.8. The complexes induced apoptosis in HeLa cells and arrested the cell cycle at the G2/M phase. Molecular docking analyses have revealed that the complexes interact with DNA via minor groove binding. The unique stereochemical configurations of the four complexes affect their selective binding to CT&#8208;DNA, with DNA binding affinities at 298 K in the following order: D1 &gt; D2 &gt; L1 &gt; L2. This study offers insights into the potential applications of these isomeric nitrosylruthenium complexes.

         <title>Interpenetrating Polymer Network Eutectogels Derived From Polymerizable Deep Eutectic Solvents for Low&#8208;Temperature Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel IPN eutectogel fabricated from polymerizable deep eutectic solvent exhibits a freezing point below &#8722;57&#176;C. It integrates high ionic conductivity, robust mechanical properties, and remarkable flexibility, enabling supercapacitors to operate reliably under bending, damage, and extreme low&#8208;temperature conditions down to &#8722;30&#176;C.








ABSTRACT
This study developed a polymerizable deep eutectic solvent (PDES) system composed of H2O, choline chloride, and acrylic acid, which exhibited a freezing point as low as &#8211;57.2&#160;&#176;C. By introducing sodium acetate and carrying out in situ polymerization within a polyacrylamide hydrogel, a high&#8208;performance eutectogel with an interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) structure was constructed. The optimized IPN eutectogel demonstrates outstanding overall properties, including high mechanical strength (tensile stress up to 97.2&#160;kPa) and toughness (fracture elongation of 235%), while maintaining high ionic conductivity (21.4&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#176;C) across a broad temperature range (&#8211;40 to 60&#176;C). Supercapacitors using this eutectogel operate effectively within a 1.2&#160;V voltage window and exhibit ideal electric double&#8208;layer capacitive behavior. They achieve a maximum energy density of 7.10&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1, retain 80% of the initial capacitance after 10,000 cycles, and show stable performance under bending, damage, and low&#8208;temperature (&#8211;30&#160;&#176;C) conditions. These results underscore the material's strong potential for use in flexible and low&#8208;temperature energy storage devices.

         <title>Protonation&#8208;Induced Electron Density Redistribution Facilitates Aggregation in PNNP Dicopper Hydride Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper(I) hydride complexes often exhibit diverse aggregation behavior that can profoundly influence their structure and reactivity. In this study we use a combined experimental and computational approach to identify key structural an electronic factors that govern aggregation in PNNP dicopperhydride complexes.








ABSTRACT
Copper(I) hydride complexes often exhibit diverse aggregation behavior that can profoundly influence their structure and reactivity. In this study, we investigate a series of dicopper hydride complexes supported by PNNP expanded pincer ligands that vary in both aggregation and ligand protonation state. Using a combined experimental and computational approach, we examine how these properties correlate and identify key structural and electronic factors that govern aggregation. Our analysis shows that electrostatic stabilization is reduced in charged monomers relative to the neutral system, making dimerization less favorable. At the same time, protonation of the ligands redistributes electron density at the hydride&#8208;bridged dicopper core, lowering interfragment overlap of occupied orbitals, which facilitates dimer formation in more protonated species. These results highlight the importance of ligand&#8208;controlled electronic structure in dictating the aggregation behavior of copper hydride complexes.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Shifting Tetralactam Macrocycles: Protonation&#8208;Activated Convergent Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shape&#8208;shifting tetralactam macrocycles with embedded pyridinedicarboxamide switches undergo reversible protonation&#8208;triggered reorganization to toggle between low&#8208; and high&#8208;affinity binding states. The protonated form exhibits &gt;10&#8309;&#8208;fold enhanced binding for BrIBr&#8722; via convergent hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions.








ABSTRACT
Integrating high binding affinity with dynamic, stimuli&#8208;responsive control represents a pivotal objective in synthetic receptor design, with far&#8208;reaching implications for sensing, separation, and molecular machinery. We report a class of shape&#8208;shifting tetralactam macrocycles featuring embedded 2,4&#8208;pyridinedicarboxamide units as switching elements. In their neutral state, these macrocycles adopt divergent hydrogen&#8208;bonding conformations that exhibit low substrate affinity. Upon protonation, a reversible conformational reorganization occurs, reorienting four amide N&#8211;H groups toward the cavity to form a convergent, high&#8208;affinity hydrogen&#8208;bonding pocket. Conformational switching was confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography and solution&#8208;phase NMR. Upon protonation, these macrocycles exhibit &gt;10&#8309;&#8208;fold binding enhancement, achieving association constants up to 135,000 M&#8722;1 for the polyhalide anion BrIBr&#8722;. Computational analysis reveals that this dramatic increase arises from synergistic hydrogen bonding, electrostatic attraction, and van der Waals interactions. These findings establish a robust strategy for designing adaptive hydrogen&#8208;bonding receptors that combine dynamic switching with high substrate affinity and selectivity. The ability to toggle between low&#8208; and high&#8208;affinity states without sacrificing structural integrity sets the stage for expanding the scope of smart molecular systems with tunable recognition properties.

         <title>pH&#8208;Switchable Excited&#8208;State Dynamics of Iridium(III) Photosensitizers Bearing an N&#8208;Heterocyclic Imine&#8208;Functionalized 2,2&#8217;&#8208;Bipyridine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

We present a new class of heteroleptic Ir(III) complexes incorporating an electron&#8208;rich 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic imine)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (bpy&#8208;NHI) ligand. The bpy&#8208;NHI ligand profoundly alters the redox and photophysical properties, enabling protonation&#8208;controlled excited&#8208;state switching and chloride binding. These results highlight bpy&#8208;NHI as a versatile platform for tunable Ir(III) photosensitizers.








ABSTRACT
We report the design, synthesis, and comprehensive photophysical characterization of a new class of heteroleptic IrIII complexes featuring a strongly electron&#8208;donating 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic imine)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (bpy&#8208;NHI) ligand. The bpy&#8208;NHI ligand was synthesized on a multigram scale via a seven&#8208;step sequence and fully characterized. Reaction with the dimer [Ir(ppy)2Cl]2 afforded the target complex [Ir(ppy)2(bpy&#8208;NHI)]+, whose electronic structure was probed by (spectro)electrochemistry as well as by steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy. Compared to the parent [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]+ complex, the new complex exhibits a significantly altered redox profile, including a novel irreversible oxidation at 0.4&#160;V vs Fc+/Fc and the absence of the typical bpy&#8208;centered reduction, consistent with the strongly electron&#8208;donating nature of the NHI substituents. The high basicity of the NHI substituents enabled modulation of the excited&#8208;state properties via protonation, leading to unusual excited&#8208;state dynamics where the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer state switches between bpy&#8208; and ppy&#8208;based character. In the protonated form, the complex is able to bind chloride ions, which was qualitatively detected by changes in the ground&#8208;state absorption of the complex. These findings establish bpy&#8208;NHI as a powerful and sensitive electron&#8208;rich ligand platform for modulating the photophysical and electrochemical properties of Ir(III) complexes, opening new opportunities for the design of photosensitizers with tailored excited&#8208;state properties.

     alt="pH-Switchable Excited-State Dynamics of Iridium(III) Photosensitizers Bearing an N-Heterocyclic Imine-Functionalized 2,2&#8217;-Bipyridine"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present a new class of heteroleptic Ir(III) complexes incorporating an electron-rich 4,4&#8242;-bis(N-heterocyclic imine)-2,2&#8242;-bipyridine (bpy-NHI) ligand. The bpy-NHI ligand profoundly alters the redox and photophysical properties, enabling protonation-controlled excited-state switching and chloride binding. These results highlight bpy-NHI as a versatile platform for tunable Ir(III) photosensitizers.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report the design, synthesis, and comprehensive photophysical characterization of a new class of heteroleptic Ir&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; complexes featuring a strongly electron-donating 4,4&#8242;-bis(N-heterocyclic imine)-2,2&#8242;-bipyridine (bpy-NHI) ligand. The bpy-NHI ligand was synthesized on a multigram scale &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; a seven-step sequence and fully characterized. Reaction with the dimer [Ir(ppy)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; afforded the target complex [Ir(ppy)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(bpy-NHI)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, whose electronic structure was probed by (spectro)electrochemistry as well as by steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopy. Compared to the parent [Ir(ppy)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(bpy)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; complex, the new complex exhibits a significantly altered redox profile, including a novel irreversible oxidation at 0.4&#160;V &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt; Fc&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Fc and the absence of the typical bpy-centered reduction, consistent with the strongly electron-donating nature of the NHI substituents. The high basicity of the NHI substituents enabled modulation of the excited-state properties via protonation, leading to unusual excited-state dynamics where the metal-to-ligand charge-transfer state switches between bpy- and ppy-based character. In the protonated form, the complex is able to bind chloride ions, which was qualitatively detected by changes in the ground-state absorption of the complex. These findings establish bpy-NHI as a powerful and sensitive electron-rich ligand platform for modulating the photophysical and electrochemical properties of Ir(III) complexes, opening new opportunities for the design of photosensitizers with tailored excited-state properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Deprotective Functionalization: An Emerging Concept for Amine Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
While protecting groups are indispensable in total synthesis to avoid undesired reactivity, installation and removal of protecting groups lead to an increase in the step&#8208;count, cost, waste production and time requirement. One approach tackling these drawbacks is deprotective functionalization, which combines deprotection and postfunctionalization in a single step, utilizing the protecting group to activate the functional group for further transformations.








Abstract
Protecting groups are widely employed in multi&#8208;step syntheses with the goal to downregulate the reactivity of certain functional groups. Their use, while often unavoidable, comes with notable drawbacks including increased costs and waste, as well as typically adding two (nonstrategic) synthetic steps to a given sequence. Moreover, late&#8208;stage deprotection of highly functionalized compounds can pose challenges. We introduced an approach termed deprotective functionalization, allowing for direct conversion of a protected functional group into a new one without requiring a separate deprotection event. Interestingly, in this paradigm the protecting group not only prevents side reactions, but also primes the protected functionality for selective transformations. This article provides a conceptual framework for this approach and discusses related strategies, currently limited to protected amines.

         <title>Large Scale Preparation of Proton Pre&#8208;intercalated &#948;&#8208;MnO2 Positive Material for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on H&#8314;/Na&#8314; exchange theory, this work presents a scalable method to prepare a layered &#948;&#8208;MnO2 cathode via a simple water treatment of a P2&#8208;Na0.67MnO2 precursor. This scalable method yields positive materials with superior rate capability and cycling stability.








ABSTRACT
Layered &#948;&#8208;MnO2 is regarded as one of the most promising positive materials for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) owing to its unique 2D layered structure, large interlayer spacing, abundant ion storage sites, and eco&#8208;friendly characteristics. However, current synthesis methods such as hydrothermal synthesis, electrochemical deposition, and solution precipitation suffer from various limitations, including safety concerns, low crystallinity, and difficulties in scaling up, which severely hinder their commercial application. Inspired by the H+/Na+ ion exchange mechanism, this study successfully prepares large&#8208;scale &#948;&#8208;MnO2 positive materials using a P2&#8208;type Na0.67MnO2 positive material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries as a precursor, followed by a simple water treatment and ion exchange process. This method is straightforward to implement, and its key steps are based on the already mature industrial preparation route for sodium&#8208;ion battery positives. The ion exchange process requires only water, and the by&#8208;product sodium salts can be recycled, demonstrating strong potential for scalable application. Electrochemical tests reveal that the obtained material exhibits a high specific capacity exceeding 400 mAh/g at 0.1 A/g and an impressive rate capacity of 183 mAh/g at 2.0 A/g. This work proposes a simple and scalable strategy for preparing &#948;&#8208;MnO2, contributing positively to advancing research on the application of aqueous ZIBs.

         <dc:description>
This schematic illustrates the key research progress in surface modification strategies for Ni&#8208;rich layered NCM cathodes. It highlights various coating approachesincluding conventional oxides, phosphates, fluorides, conductive polymers, composite/hybrid systems, and high&#8208;entropy materialsthat synergistically enhance structural stability, suppress interfacial side reactions, and improve Li+ transport. The figure also emphasizes advanced design concepts such as coreshell structures, gradient doping, and primary&#8208;particle&#8208;level engineering, collectively contributing to ultra&#8208;stable and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Nickel&#8208;rich layered LiNixCoyMnzO2 (NCM, x &#8805;$ \ge $ 0.6) cathodes have been widely used for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), delivering exceptional capacity (&#8805;$( \ge $200 mAh g&#8722;1) and remarkable cost&#8208;efficiency. Nevertheless, structural degradation (e.g., oxygen vacancy formation, transition metal dissolution) and interfacial instability (side reactions) under high&#8208;voltage operation (&gt;$ &gt; $4.3&#160;V) severely limit their cycle life. Recent advances demonstrate that precisely engineered surface coatings can synergistically address these limitations through suppressing parasitic reactions, stabilizing lattice frameworks, and enhancing Li+ transport kinetics. This review provides a multidimensional analysis of coating engineering for NCM cathodes, focusing on the mechanism insights, innovative designs, and synthesis route. Notably, this work emphasizes emerging opportunities within underexplored research areas, specifically artificial intelligence&#8208;enabled coating architectures and sustainable large&#8208;scale synthesis methodologies. By systematically integrating fundamental mechanistic insights with practical engineering perspectives, a robust framework to accelerate the utilization of NCM cathodes as ultra&#8208;stable and safe energy storage systems is established in this review.

         <title>Bioinspired Underwater Adhesive With Spontaneous, Rapid, Stable, and Robust Adhesion in Dynamic Water Environment</title>

ABSTRACT
Marine mussels exhibit remarkable adhesive capabilities, providing key inspiration for developing underwater adhesives. However, most existing underwater adhesives fail to replicate the convenient, robust, rapid, and stable adhesion of marine mussels. In this work, we developed a biomimetic underwater adhesive (BMUA) that combines catechol group with solvent&#8208;responsive curing mechanism. BMUA was synthesized via a straightforward one&#8208;step free radical polymerization in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), using methacrylic acid (MA) and N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) as hydrogen bond (H&#8208;bond) components, methyl methacrylate (MMA) as a hydrophobic monomer, and DOPA&#8208;functionalized methacrylate as the adhesive unit. Upon water contact, BMUA undergoes solvent exchange rapidly, triggering the formation of a H&#8208;bond and hydrophobic crosslinked network. This process effectively displaces interfacial water and enables solidification, resulting in strong underwater adhesion. The BMUA demonstrates high adhesive strength on various substrates under flowing water and maintains robust bonding stability across a range of pH, salinity, and temperature conditions. Notably, BMUA retains efficient adhesion (&gt;1.4&#160;MPa) even after 45 days and shows promising performance in practical applications such as underwater sealing, targeted bonding, and rapid hemostasis in a rat liver injury model. This work offers a new design strategy for high&#8208;performance underwater adhesives that closely mimic the advantageous adhesion of marine mussels.

         <title>Computational Understanding of Catalyst Design: Palladium Pincer Complexes for Carbon Dioxide Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electronic structure/reactivity relationship in differently designed palladium pincer complexes for carbon dioxide hydrogenation is computationally elucidated, showcasing how hydrogen bonding between the O atom of the carboxylic arm and the base L plays a critical role in the second sphere reactivity by dictating the Pd&#948;+&#8208;O&#948;&#8722; bond polarity which is the site where dihydrogen activation occurs.








ABSTRACT
Experimental catalyst design to promote the hydrogenation of CO2 has led to the synthesis of an efficient tripodal palladium pincer complex. This work presents a computational reading key of the ligand design for efficient transition metal catalysts using palladium pincer complexes as precise representatives. By investigating the electronic structure/reactivity relationship, we demonstrate that all the progressive adjustments of the pincer architecture do not significantly affect the Pd&#8208;L (L = PCy3, PPh3) bond and the electron density rearrangement in the first coordination sphere of the complex. We find a strong Pd&#8208;L bond, where the dispersion energy contribution is substantial, that rules out the previously proposed mechanism involving Pd&#8208;L bond breaking. Mechanisms of H2 activation and CO2 reduction are revisited, which showcase how the secondary coordination sphere plays a critical role in reactivity, strongly affecting the Pd&#8208;O (carboxylic arm) bond polarization due to hydrogen bond formation with the O atom. The catalytically active complex is demonstrated to perform through a stepwise mechanism involving polar addition of H2 across the Pd&#948;+&#8208;O&#948;&#8722; bond and subsequent OH deprotonation by an external base (DBU), forming a Pd&#8208;H hydride complex, which easily reacts with CO2 through an outer&#8208;sphere hydride transfer path.

         <title>Catalytic Synthesis of Allylic Sulfones Directly From Secondary Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8226; Direct synthesis of useful allylic sulfones.
&#8226; Secondary alcohols: feedstock chemicals
&#8226; Broad substrate scope
&#8226; Excellent selectivity
&#8226; Role of water in catalyst regeneration
&#8226; Green byproducts: H2O and H2








ABSTRACT
Allylic sulfones are valuable structures in bioactive compounds and serve as versatile intermediates in organic synthesis. A selective method for the C&#8211;C coupling of aryl sulfones with secondary alcohols has been developed using a Ru&#8208;SNS pincer catalyst. This transformation enables efficient access to allylic sulfones under mild conditions with broad functional group tolerance. Sensitive moieties, including olefins and pharmaceutically relevant piperazine&#8208;substituted aryl sulfones, are well tolerated. The method demonstrates wide synthetic utility, converting natural product&#8208;derived alcohols such as geraniol, nopol, and perillyl alcohol into corresponding sulfone products in high yield. Mechanistic studies suggest the reaction proceeds via initial dehydrogenation of the secondary alcohol to generate a carbonyl intermediate, followed by nucleophilic addition of a sulfone&#8208;derived carbanion. A subsequent isomerization step furnishes the allylic sulfone. DFT calculations support this pathway and reveal a key role for the water generated during alcohol oxidation. This in situ formed water facilitates both catalyst regeneration and the final isomerization step, functioning as an essential component in the catalytic cycle. This method provides a practical, atom&#8208;economical approach to allylic sulfones with high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity, expanding the toolbox for sulfone chemistry in synthesis and medicinal chemistry applications.

         <title>Unsymmetrical &#946;&#8208;Fused Blatter Radical Zinc Phthalocyanines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report the first synthesis of a new class of &#946;&#8208;fused Blatter&#8211;Zn phthalocyanines featuring a persistent radical &#960;&#8208;system, &#960;&#8211;&#960;&#8208;driven crystal packing, and SOMO&#8208;centered redox behavior. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction shows packing motifs dominated by centrosymmetric &#960;&#8208;&#960; dimers. DFT reveals cooperative spin communication, establishing a platform for tunable spin and optical materials.








ABSTRACT
Blatter&#8208;type radicals defy conventional chemical expectations, combining unusual stability with intriguing electronic and magnetic properties. We report the first phthalocyanines fused at the periphery with a Blatter&#8208;type radical, creating an extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated framework. These hybrids merge the characteristic optical and electronic properties of phthalocyanines with a robust, spin&#8208;bearing radical, maintaining remarkable stability under ambient conditions. Spectroscopic, crystallographic, and computational studies reveal their distinctive electronic structure, offering insights into radical &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems.

         <title>Recent Advances in Synthesis and Applications of Functional Rare&#8208;Earth Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents a systematic overview of the synthetic strategies for rare earth metal&#8208;organic frameworks (RE&#8208;MOFs), emphasizing the design and roles of metal nodes and ligand structures, and provides a comprehensive summary of their current applications in detecting volatile organic compounds, small molecules, cations, anions, biomarkers, and temperature, as well as in optical encoding and anti&#8208;counterfeiting technologies, and rare earth separation.








ABSTRACT
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have garnered significant attention over the past few decades due to their diverse chemical architectures and tunable physicochemical properties, culminating in the award of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2025. By integrating various metal nodes with organic linkers, MOFs offer extensive opportunities for rational design, controlled synthesis, and multifunctional applications. From structural and functional perspectives, MOFs incorporating rare earth (RE) elements (such as scandium, yttrium, and the 15 lanthanides) constitute a distinct subclass of MOFs. The structural diversity of RE metal&#8208;organic frameworks (RE&#8208;MOFs) is intrinsically correlated with their unique functional characteristics, which primarily stem from the precise selection of metal centers and the deliberate design of organic ligands. This review presents a systematic overview of the synthetic strategies for RE&#8208;MOFs, emphasizing the design and roles of metal nodes and ligand structures, and provides a comprehensive summary of their current applications in detecting volatile organic compounds, small molecules, cations, anions, biomarkers, and temperature, as well as in optical encoding and anti&#8208;counterfeiting technologies, and rare eart separation.

         <title>Triggering and Preventing Cyclization of o&#8208;Amino&#8208;Guanidinobenzenes to 2&#8208;Amino&#8208;Benzimidazoles</title>

o&#8208;Amino&#8208;guanidinobenzenes are generally prone to cyclization to 2&#8208;amino&#8208;benzimidazoles. In this work, strategies to prevent such cyclizations are developed, allowing to use these compounds as ligands in coordination chemistry and for the design of novel (unsymmetrical) redox&#8208;active ligands.








ABSTRACT
Aromatic compounds in which a primary or secondary amino group is positioned next (in ortho position) to a guanidino group have been reported as intermediates in a variety of reactions, but are generally prone to cyclization to give 2&#8208;amino&#8208;imidazoles. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis, based on experiments and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, of the stability and reactivity of these compounds. It is shown that cyclization reactions are triggered by Br&#248;nsted and Lewis acids. The analysis discloses strategies allowing to prevent cyclization by careful choice of the guanidino group and/or substituent at the amino group. The results of this analysis allowed the synthesis of first unsymmetrical diguanidinobenzene molecules and coordination compounds with o&#8208;amino&#8208;guanidinobenzene ligands, paving the way for the development of aromatic compounds with adjacent amino and guanidino groups as a versatile class of redox&#8208;active organic molecules.

         <title>XFEL&#8208;Detected Peroxide Formation From the S3 State Supports the Low Oxidation State over the High Oxidation State Paradigm in Photosystem II</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT calculations show that peroxide formation from the S3 state is inconsistent with the HOS model, as Mn(IV) readily oxidizes peroxide to O2. In contrast, the LOS model stabilizes the peroxide observed by XFEL, since Mn(III) cannot promote further oxidation.








ABSTRACT
The mechanism of O&#8211;O bond formation in PSII is still debated. Although it is generally accepted to occur during the S3 &#8594; [S4] &#8594; S0 transition, some studies suggest it may already begin in the S3 state. Notably, the 2017 XFEL study by Suga et&#160;al. supports this hypothesis by reporting structural features consistent with a peroxide intermediate formed from the S3 state. Here, we present DFT calculations showing that, in the high oxidation state (HOS) model, O&#8211;O coupling starting from the S3 state with the hydroxo&#8211;oxo configuration is kinetically feasible, forming a peroxide intermediate via a modest activation energy of 19.5&#160;kcal/mol. However, in the HOS model, the resulting peroxide would be readily converted to O2 with &#916;G&#8225; = 11&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1, inconsistent with experimental observations that O2 release proceeds only after reaching the [S4] state. In contrast, we show that if peroxide forms from the S3 state, its persistence is more plausibly explained by the low oxidation state (LOS) model, where further conversion to superoxide or O2 is energetically unfavorable. This distinction between these two models stems from the greater oxidizing power of Mn(IV) in the HOS paradigm relative to Mn(III) in the LOS paradigm in promoting peroxide&#8208;to&#8208;O2 conversion.

         <title>Impact of Hole Transporting Layers on the Composition of Chemical Vapor Deposited Perovskite and Performance of Semitransparent Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reveal that the surface properties of the substrate play a crucial role in determining the surface composition and optoelectronic properties of the perovskite films. By optimizing the HTL, we achieved 17.5% efficiency for semitransparent perovskite solar module via all vacuum deposition processes.








ABSTRACT
Low&#8208;pressure chemical vapor deposition (CVD) offers good scalability, substrate compatibility, and solvent&#8208;free processing for metal halide perovskite films fabrication, yet limited control over the film composition has hindered the device performance compared to solution&#8208;based methods. Herein, we investigate how the substrate surface property affect the composition and optoelectronic properties of perovskite films fabricated by CVD. By changing the hole transporting layers (HTLs), different crystallization process and chemical stoichiometry of perovskite films have been observed. Perovskite films grown on nickel oxide|self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) exhibit a more stoichiometric buried surface, along with a higher work function (WF) and enhanced p&#8208;type character that are favorable for hole transport. Leveraging these insights, we demonstrate all vapor&#8208;deposited semitransparent perovskite solar cells (ST&#8208;PSCs) with a champion efficiency of 18.0%, retaining &#8764;100% of the initial performance after 500 h of continuous operation (ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1). Furthermore, we achieve a champion efficiency of 17.5% for semitransparent mini&#8208;modules fabricated via the all&#8208;vacuum process.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Para&#8208;Selective C&#9472;H Borylation via Attractive Weak Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Site&#8208;selective activation and borylation of para C&#9472;H bonds pose a significant challenge; however, this transformation can be accomplished through the strategic use of weak noncovalent interactions. This concept article provides a detailed overview of these emerging strategies.








ABSTRACT
Iridium&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;H borylation has garnered significant attention from the scientific community, as organoboron compounds serve as important synthetic intermediates that can be utilized in various subsequent transformations while maintaining high selectivity. Among the three types of C&#9472;H bonds, the activation and borylation of para C&#9472;H bonds present the greatest challenge due to their largest distance from the functional group. Nevertheless, the activation of this bond can be achieved through the use of various weak noncovalent interactions. In recent years, numerous strategies have been developed that leverage these weak interactions for iridium&#8208;catalyzed para&#8208;selective C&#9472;H borylation. This concept article offers a detailed overview of these strategies, organized by the types of noncovalent interactions involved, while also discussing the progress, challenges, and future directions in this domain.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photochemical side of cyclopropenes. Cyclopropenes are valuable synthetic tools in organic chemistry. In particular, this review focuses on the photochemistry of cyclopropenes. The reactivity of cyclopropenes excited by irradiation is discussed showing their unique potential for organic synthesis. Moreover, reactions of cyclopropenes at ground state with other photo&#8208;excited molecules is also presented, including recent applications in bioorthogonal reactions.








ABSTRACT
This review covers the reactivity of cyclopropenes under light irradiation. Cyclopropenes have a formidable and complex photochemistry. While fundamental photochemistry of cyclopropenes was early studied, the synthetic potential has not been developed at comparable pace as synthetic photochemistry has recently evolved. In this review, the main types of light&#8208;mediated reactivity of cyclopropenes is briefly presented and focus on the synthetic possibilities offered by these reactions. Moreover, photochemical reactions in which cyclopropenes at ground state react with other photo&#8208;excited molecules are also presented. Finally, the value of cyclopropenes in a different field as light&#8208;mediated bio&#8208;orthogonal reactions is succinctly introduced.

         <title>Spectroscopic Fingerprinting of Coordination&#8208;driven Spin States in Metal&#8208;organic Architectures</title>

         <dc:description>
Coordination geometry controls spin states in Co&#8208;TCNQ frameworks. Combined theory and XAS confirm the high&#8208;spin Co2+ on graphene and establish a direct approach for spin&#8208;state assignment in metal&#8208;organic systems.








ABSTRACT
Determining the local geometry of metal&#8208;organic architecture on substrates is challenging, as substrate interactions can alter the metal coordination relative to the free&#8208;standing structure. Here, combining density functional theory (DFT) and restricted open&#8208;shell configuration interaction with singles (ROCIS) calculations on isolated cobalt&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (Co&#8208;TCNQ) complexes, together with X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X&#8208;ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD), directly reveals the coordination motifs of Co centers in a 2D Co&#8208;TCNQ framework on graphene. The calculated Co L3,2&#8208;edges spectroscopic fingerprints for nearly planar (Co2+, S = 1/2) and distorted tetrahedral (Co2+, S = 3/2) structures exhibit distinct features, allowing unambiguous assignment of spin and oxidation states of the metal centers, as well as confirmation of the local geometry. Comparison with experimental spectra confirms that the high&#8208;spin tetrahedral geometry is realized in the supported framework, demonstrating how spectroscopic fingerprints can directly link coordination geometry to spin and oxidation states in low&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;organic systems.

         <title>Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based Supramolecular Crosslinking Polymers With Multiple Ruthenium Centers for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As cathode materials for nitrate reduction (NO3RR), covalently cross&#8208;linked supramolecular electrocatalysts demonstrate high performance: Under alkaline conditions at &#8722;0.8&#160;V versus RHE, the NH3 yield is 8.72&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 with a Faradaic efficiency (FENH3) of 78.5%. In neutral electrolyte, the NH3 yield rate is 7.45&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 accompanied by a FENH3 of 83.8%.








ABSTRACT
Possessing multiple catalytic sites, supramolecular polymers have received attention due to their desirable electrocatalytic activity for ammonia synthesis from NO3&#175;. Herein, a covalently cross&#8208;linked supramolecular catalytic system (Ru@POP&#8208;CD) was synthesized by nucleophilic substitution reaction between ruthenium&#8208;coordinated phenanthroline cyclodextrin and tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile, which is not only efficiently electrocatalytic for ammonia synthesis from nitrate but also provides an effective way to combat environmental pollution. Different from noncovalently cross&#8208;linked supramolecular polymers, Ru@POP&#8208;CD could be kept on the electrode for cycle use and inhibit the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), achieving a Faradaic efficiency (FENH3) of 78.5% at &#8722;0.8&#160;V versus RHE in 0.1&#160;M KNO3/0.1&#160;M KOH solution, with a NH3 yield rate of 8.72&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2. This superior electrocatalytic performance is attributed to the unique cyclic structure with rich hydroxyl groups of the cyclodextrin, effective affinity for anionic nitrate through hydrogen bonding and the synergistic interaction of Ru tunable d&#8208;orbitals, facilitating the electroreduction of nitrate at the electrode. Meanwhile, in neutral electrolyte (0.1&#160;M KNO3/0.05&#160;M K2SO4), Ru@POP&#8208;CD still possesses highly efficient catalytic performance, with the NH3 yield rate of 7.45&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and FENH3 of 83.8% at &#8722;0.9&#160;V versus RHE, showing great potential in electrochemical energy supply systems.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Functional Top&#8208;Interface Passivation Using a Thiohydantoin Derivative for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an effective multi&#8208;functional passivation strategy by utilizing 3&#8208;Phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;Thiohydantoin&#8208;5&#8208;Propionic Acid (PTGA) as a multifunctional surface treatment modulator. The &#8208;NH&#8208; moieties in PTGA can repair anionic surface defects through hydrogen bonding, whereas its C = O of &#9472;COOH groups functionalities effectively coordinate uncoordinated Pb2+ cations, thus passivating cationic defects.








ABSTRACT
The efficiency and stability of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are primarily limited by substantial nonradiative recombination losses at the interfaces, particularly the perovskite (PVK)/electron transport layer (ETL) interface. Here, we introduce a versatile passivation strategy that employs a multifunctional molecule, 3&#8208;Phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;Thiohydantoin&#8208;5&#8208;Propionic Acid (PTGA), as an interlayer at PVK/ETL interface. The &#9472;NH&#9472; moieties in PTGA can repair anionic surface defects through hydrogen bonding, whereas its carbonyl (C = O) functionalities in &#9472;COOH effectively passivate the undercoordinated Pb2+ cations. This cooperative action leads to a marked decrease in interfacial defect concentration. As a result, the approach improves the crystallinity of the active layer, optimizes energy band alignment, boosts electron extraction efficiency, and suppresses nonradiative recombination. The treated inverted solar cells deliver a champion efficiency of 25.13% with improved long&#8208;term storage stability and persistent light illumination stability, substantially outperforming their untreated counterparts. This work provides a profound mechanistic understanding of multisite molecular passivation and delivers a simple yet effective strategy to advance the commercial prospects of perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>An Achiral Tetradentate Cis&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Coordinating NCCN Ligand Gives Rise to a Configurationally Stable Chiral&#8208;at&#8208;Iron Complex for Enantioselective Catalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
The design and synthesis of a linear tetradentate NCCN ligand incorporating two 1,2,3&#8208;triazolin&#8208;5&#8208;ylidene mesoionic carbene donors, and its application to asymmetric iron catalysis is reported. This work represents the first example of an iron complex derived from a cis&#8208;&#945;&#8208;coordinating tetradentate NCCN ligand, and notably, the first chiral iron catalyst derived from an achiral tetradentate ligand.








ABSTRACT
Ligand design plays a crucial role in developing chiral transition metal complexes with enhanced or new catalytic properties. Here, we report our progress toward a new class of linear tetradentate NCCN ligands incorporating strongly &#963;&#8208;donating carbene moieties. The NCCN ligand coordinates to iron(II) in a cis&#8208;&#945; topology, with two pyridine donors occupying the apical positions and two 1,2,3&#8208;triazolin&#8208;5&#8208;ylidene mesoionic carbene (MIC) donors in the equatorial plane. Two acetonitrile ligands complete the octahedral coordination sphere, and their lability provides the basis for the observed catalytic activity. Notably, the two strongly &#963;&#8208;donating MIC groups create a strong ligand field, which is critical for achieving configurational stability of the metal&#8208;centered stereogenicity. This design strategy thus enabled the first chiral&#8208;at&#8208;iron catalyst derived from an achiral tetradentate ligand, which was applied to catalytic and enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H amination and a Cannizzaro reaction.

         <title>Catalytic Oxidation of Commodity Plastics: Advances in Polyethylene and Polystyrene Valorization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent progress in the catalytic oxidative upcycling of polyethylene and polystyrene, emphasizing catalyst design, reaction mechanisms, and product selectivity. By comparing different catalytic systems and oxidation strategies, it highlights how molecular&#8208;level control of active oxygen species can transform inert plastics into valuable chemicals. The review also outlines future directions in catalyst innovation, process optimization, and sustainability assessment to guide the development of efficient and industrially viable plastic upcycling technologies.








ABSTRACT
Polyethylene and polystyrene are among the most representative hard&#8208;to&#8208;degrade plastic due to their chemical inertness and massive generation, making their efficient upcycling a pressing challenge for environmental sustainability. Conventional recycling methods, such as incineration, landfilling, and mechanical processing, often cause high energy consumption, severe pollution, and product devaluation, which is unfavorable for circular utilization of plastics. In contrast, chemical recycling, particularly catalytic oxidation, has recently gained much attention for enabling plastic valorization under relatively mild conditions, with straightforward separation processes and high&#8208;value products. Despite these advantages, catalytic oxidation remains at an early stage, facing challenges such as unclear catalyst structure&#8208;activity relationships, insufficient reactivity, and limited selectivity. To address these issues, this review highlights recent advances in the catalytic oxidative conversion of polyethylene and polystyrene, focusing on catalyst design, reaction mechanism elucidation, and product selectivity control. Furthermore, perspectives are provided on future research directions, including the development of novel catalysts, optimization of mass transfer, regulation of reactive oxygen species, adaptability to mixed plastic waste, techno&#8208;economic analysis, life cycle assessment, and reaction safety evaluation.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Benzylic Substitutions Through &#951;3&#8208;Benzyl&#8208;Metal Intermediates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite their significant synthetic value, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric benzylic substitutions remain undeveloped compared to the Tsuji&#8208;Trost reaction, primarily due to the inherent challenge associated with endothermic dearomatization. Several catalytic strategies have been explored to overcome the corresponding issues, including single metal, bimetallic, metal/organo, and ternary catalysis.








Abstract
Although transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric benzylic substitution is conceptually analogous to asymmetric allylic substitution, proceeding via &#951;3&#8208;benzyl&#8208;metal and &#951;3&#8208;allyl&#8208;metal intermediates, respectively, the development of the former, involving benzylic electrophiles, has received comparatively less attention within the synthetic community. This limited progress is largely attributed to the low reactivity of benzylic electrophiles and the associated challenge in achieving stereoselective control. Over the past several decades, different catalytic strategies, such as single metal catalysis, bimetallic catalysis, metal/organo catalysis, and ternary catalysis, have been developed to address these challenges. Asymmetric versions of these transformations have also been established, enabling the construction of stereocenters either at the benzylic electrophiles, at nucleophile, or simultaneously at both sites. This review provides a comprehensive overview of this field from its inception to the present. It summarizes advances in substrate scope, mechanistic understanding, synthetic applications, and remaining challenges, with the aim of fostering further progress in this emerging area.

     alt="Transition-Metal-Catalyzed Asymmetric Benzylic Substitutions Through &#951;3-Benzyl-Metal Intermediates"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite their significant synthetic value, transition-metal-catalyzed asymmetric benzylic substitutions remain undeveloped compared to the Tsuji-Trost reaction, primarily due to the inherent challenge associated with endothermic dearomatization. Several catalytic strategies have been explored to overcome the corresponding issues, including single metal, bimetallic, metal/organo, and ternary catalysis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although transition-metal-catalyzed asymmetric benzylic substitution is conceptually analogous to asymmetric allylic substitution, proceeding via &lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-benzyl-metal and &lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-allyl-metal intermediates, respectively, the development of the former, involving benzylic electrophiles, has received comparatively less attention within the synthetic community. This limited progress is largely attributed to the low reactivity of benzylic electrophiles and the associated challenge in achieving stereoselective control. Over the past several decades, different catalytic strategies, such as single metal catalysis, bimetallic catalysis, metal/organo catalysis, and ternary catalysis, have been developed to address these challenges. Asymmetric versions of these transformations have also been established, enabling the construction of stereocenters either at the benzylic electrophiles, at nucleophile, or simultaneously at both sites. This review provides a comprehensive overview of this field from its inception to the present. It summarizes advances in substrate scope, mechanistic understanding, synthetic applications, and remaining challenges, with the aim of fostering further progress in this emerging area.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bioorthogonal Chemistry: An Emerging Strategy for Targeted Protein Degradation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent advances in the application of bioorthogonal chemistry in targeted protein degradation (TPD). It discusses how bioorthogonal chemistry and its integration with other technologies address the limitations of TPD agents, providing insights into future applications of bioorthogonal chemistry in TPD.








ABSTRACT
Targeted protein degradation (TPD) technologies represent a promising strategy to overcome drug resistance associated with traditional small&#8208;molecule inhibitors (SMIs) while targeting traditionally considered nondruggable targets. However, the frequent noncompliance of TPD agents with Lipinski's &#8220;Rule of Five&#8221; poses significant druggability challenges. Off&#8208;target toxicity and the &#8220;hook effect&#8221; further limit TPD applications. With the development of bioorthogonal chemistry, self&#8208;assembly TPD agents and TPD agent prodrugs based on bioorthogonal chemistry offer a viable solution to address these issues. This review summarizes recent advances in integrating bioorthogonal chemistry with TPD technologies, specifically highlighting its role in improving conventional TPD agents drawbacks.

         <title>Stable Ambiphilic Bis(N&#8208;Heterocyclic Imino)&#8208;Substituted Terminal Olefin and Its Diazoolefin Derivative Exhibits Unusual Dimerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ambiphilic bis&#8208;imino terminal olefin was synthesized and comprehensively characterized, demonstrating air, moisture, and thermal stability. It shows distinct reactivity compared to traditional NHOs, leading to the isolation of two unique N&#8208;containing heterocycles.








ABSTRACT
In this article, we report a novel bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic imino) terminal olefin, [{(CAAC)N}2C&#9552;CH2] [CAAC = cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene], which exhibits reactivity distinct from traditional N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins. The use of the (CAAC)&#8211;derived ambiphilic N&#8208;heterocyclic imino fragment {(CAAC)N&#8210;} was crucial in imparting the unique properties of [{(CAAC)N}2C&#9552;CH2]. The imino groups act as strong electron donors, rendering the terminal olefin polar through &#960;&#8208;delocalization, whereas the carbenic carbon of CAAC introduces an electrophilic site into the imino substituent. This combination results in an inherently ambiphilic olefin that displays unusual reactivity. Specifically, the reaction of [{(CAAC)N}2C&#9552;CH2] with tosyl azide, under varying stoichiometric conditions, furnished four distinct nitrogen&#8208;rich compounds, including two unprecedented nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations were carried out to elucidate the bonding features of the ambiphilic bis&#8208;imino terminal olefin as well as the newly formed heterocycles.

         <title>Mechanistic and DFT Insights Into Co&#8208;Catalytic MgFe&#8208;LDH/Hematite Interfaces for Efficient Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin MgFe&#8208;LDH nanosheets serve as an effective OER co&#8208;catalyst for &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 photoanodes, boosting photocurrent by 4.6 times and lowering the onset potential by 340&#160;mV. DFT calculations attribute this to a reduced kinetic energy barrier at the LDH active sites.








ABSTRACT
Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are low&#8208;cost and versatile materials, many of which are well&#8208;established water oxidation electrocatalysts. A simple MgFe&#8208;LDH variant, synthesized as size&#8208;tunable nanosheets, was successfully decorated on the surface of hematite (&#945;&#8208;Fe2O3) nanorods to structure an integrating photoanode for improved photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation. Combined XPS and SEM analysis showed that MgFe&#8208;LDH decoration does not interfere with the nanostructure of the light&#8208;harvesting &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3. However, intensified Raman bands for the decorated &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 pointed to enhanced interactions between MgFe&#8208;LDH and &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3. Optimization of the surface amount for MgFe&#8208;LDH can lead to a 340&#160;mV cathodic shift in the onset potential at 0.1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Mott&#8208;Schottky analysis and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy further revealed that LDH decoration enhances the photogenerated charge&#8208;carrier separation and efficiently consumes holes accumulating at the electrode surface. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest a lower Gibbs free energy (&#916;G) value of 1.35&#160;eV for MgFe&#8208;LDH/&#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 contrasted to pristine &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 (&#916;G of&#160;1.46&#160;eV) for the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS), further indicating that the MgFe&#8208;LDH co&#8208;catalyst lowers the activation energy barrier for the OER. This work offers a promising method for designing high&#8208;efficiency and low&#8208;cost hematite&#8208;based photoanodes for solar&#8208;fuel devices relying on noncritical elements.

         <title>Oxidative Addition of C&#8208;F Bonds to the Phosphoranide Ion [P(C2F5)2F2]&#8722;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The difluorobis(pentafluoroethyl)phosphoranide anion (&#955;$\lambda $4&#963;$\sigma $4&#8208;phosphate) reacts with substrates containing activated C&#9472;F bonds (Rf&#160; = &#160;perfluoroaryl, &#8208;alkenyl, and &#8208;acetyl) yielding corresponding trifluorophoshates. The colorless solids exhibit a high thermal stability and are bench stable. This reaction behavior extends the toolbox for possible functionalization of inherently strong C&#9472;F bonds.








ABSTRACT
Oxidative additions of C&#9472;Hal bonds (Hal&#160; = &#160;F, Cl, Br, I) are widely known for a variety of transition metal complexes owing to their range of oxidation states and flexible coordination sphere. Low valent main group element compounds were shown to mimic this reaction behavior, due to the propensity of changing their oxidation state and coordination number by +2. Yet the addition to C&#9472;F bonds is especially challenging due to a large bond dissociation energy. While several examples are known for compounds from group 13 and 14, only few reports demonstrate this type of reaction for compounds from group 15. Herein we report the first anionic P(III) species undergoing an oxidative addition of C&#9472;F bonds. The tetracoordinated [P(C2F5)2F2]&#8722;&#8208;anion reacts readily with fluorinated arenes, olefins, and acid fluorides yielding respective hexacoordinated P(V) phosphates under mild conditions.

         <title>Highly Efficient Organocatalytic House&#8208;Meinwald Rearrangement for the Facile Synthesis of Aldehydes: Swift Access to Ibuprofen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We use readily available epoxides and 0.5 mol% bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (Tf2N) as a catalyst to synthesize a broad range of aldehydes in yields ranging from 89% to 97%. Furthermore, we identified aldehyde dimerization intermediates at lower temperatures and observed their cleavage at 55 &#176;C. To demonstrate the applicability of our new approach, we synthesized ibuprofen in a three&#8208;step process with an overall yield of 90%.








ABSTRACT
We present a new organocatalytic method for synthesizing aldehydes under mild conditions using readily accessible terminal epoxides as starting materials and bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (Tf2NH) as the catalyst. We identified intermediate aldehyde dimerization products at lower temperatures and observed their cleavage at 55&#176;C. We isolated the products in yields of 89&#8211;97% using catalyst loadings as low as 0.5 mol%. To underline the applicability of our new approach, we synthesized ibuprofen in a three&#8208;step process and overall yield of 90%.

         <title>Lattice Strain and Electron Modulation in Bimetallic Bi&#8211;Sb Catalysts for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction to Formate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work designs a bimetallic Bi&#8211;Sb catalyst via lattice strain engineering and electronic modulation for efficient CO2 electroreduction. By introducing localized strain and modulating the electronic structure, Sbdoping enhances CO2 adsorption and increases formate selectivity. The optimal Bi99Sb1 catalyst achieves 99% formate Faradaic efficiency and demonstrates the highest intrinsic activity, demonstrating a dual&#8208;regulation strategy to advance Bi&#8208;based electrocatalysts.








ABSTRACT
The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to valuable chemicals and fuels using bismuth&#8208;based catalysts offers a promising pathway toward achieving carbon neutrality. It is widely acknowledged that lattice strain significantly influences the catalytic performance of electrocatalysts in the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Nevertheless, research dedicated to lattice strain engineering in Bi&#8208;based catalysts, particularly through the introduction of similar elements from the same group, remains limited. In this work, we rationally designed a bimetallic Bi&#8211;Sb catalyst by incorporating Sb into the Bi lattice to induce controlled lattice strain and electronic effects.&#160;The optimized Bi99Sb1 catalyst achieved a peak formate Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 99.4% in a flow cell, maintained FEs above 94.8% over a broad potential window (&#8722;0.6 to &#8722;1.1&#160;V vs. RHE), and exhibited the highest intrinsic activity. In situ characterizations and density functional theory calculations revealed that Sb doping introduced localized lattice strain while modulating the electronic structure of adjacent Bi sites, thereby strengthening CO2 adsorption and activation on Bi active centers, reducing the energy barrier for forming the critical *OCHO intermediate. This work highlights the effectiveness of incorporating neighboring metals to tailor lattice strain in Bi&#8208;based electrocatalysts, providing a feasible strategy to enhance the catalytic performance of Bi&#8208;based electrocatalysts.

         <title>Measurement and Analysis of Vibronic Coupling in Two Dysprosium(III) Complexes of Opposite Magnetic Anisotropy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;crystal far&#8208;infrared magnetospectroscopy is used to reveal magnetic anisotropy and vibronic coupling in a pair of dysprosium(III) complexes.








ABSTRACT
The loss of magnetic memory in single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) is caused by the coupling of molecular vibrations to spin states, which plays a significant role in magnetic relaxation processes. Gaining direct evidence of vibronic coupling using experimental techniques is critical to understanding and controlling this phenomenon. Most studies focus on assessing the spin&#8208;phonon coupling in SMMs to help control this relaxation; herein we gain insight by comparing the SMM [Dy(OPCy3)2(H2O)5][CF3SO3]3.2(OPCy3)&#160;to the non&#8208;SMM [Dy{N(SiMe3)2}3]&#160;through collection of far&#8208;infrared magnetospectroscopy (FIRMS) spectra and validation with ab initio calculations. Single&#8208;crystal measurements display a prominent feature in the spectra at 340 cm&#8722;1, corresponding to an electronic excitation which varies depending on the direction of external magnetic field applied. These findings demonstrate the complicated effect of magnetic anisotropy on the vibronic coupling in SMMs and demonstrate the power of FIRMS to study these effects.

The power of catalytic promiscuity: The enantioselective conjugate hydrocyanation of enals remains a long&#8208;standing challenge for biocatalysis.

ABSTRACT
The enantioselective conjugate hydrocyanation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes remains a long&#8208;standing challenge in synthetic chemistry. Here, we report the redesign of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;ribose&#8208;5&#8208;phosphate aldolase (DERA) into an efficient biocatalyst capable of promoting the asymmetric conjugate addition of hydrogen cyanide (generated in situ from trimethylsilyl cyanide) to aromatic enals via an iminium activation pathway. The evolved variant DERA&#8208;CN enables the efficient formation of various C4&#8208;nitriles with high conversions (up to 99%) and good enantioselectivity (up to 98% e.e.). Control experiments revealed a stepwise process involving enzyme&#8208;catalyzed conjugate hydrocyanation followed by spontaneous 1,2&#8208;addition of cyanide. Substrates with various electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups are tolerated, providing access to various enantioenriched nitriles. This work expands the scope of DERA&#8208;promoted iminium catalysis and provides a rare enzymatic platform for asymmetric conjugate hydrocyanation under mild aqueous conditions.

         <title>Selective Oxidation of H2S via P and Transition&#8208;Metal Dual Sites on Polymeric Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
The development of catalysts featuring high&#8208;density active sites and superior stability is critical for achieving efficient and selective H2S oxidation. This study systematically investigates the catalytic performance and reaction mechanisms of transition metal&#8208;embedded phosphorus&#8208;doped carbon nitride catalysts (i.e., TM&#8208;P@melon, TM = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) for H2S oxidation using density functional theory calculations. Our calculations identified FeN4&#8208;P@melon and MnN4&#8208;P@melon as the most promising candidates, with Gibbs free energy changes (&#916;G) of &#8722;0.24&#160;eV and 0.07&#160;eV for the potential&#8208;determining step in the selective oxidation of H2S to elemental sulfur, respectively. Anchored TM and P atoms act synergistically to narrow the melon&#8208;CN band gap and enhance O2 adsorption/activation, thereby boosting the catalytic reaction. This work provides fundamental theoretical insights for designing highly efficient and selective H2S oxidation catalysts while elucidating the atomic&#8208;level mechanisms governing the catalytic process.

         <title>Construction of Heterostructure Pseudocapacitive Electrode VN/MnOx on Carbon Sheet Synthesized by C3N4 Self&#8208;Sacrifice Method for Supercapacitors</title>

ABSTRACT
Vanadium nitride (VN) is considered as a promising electrode for supercapacitors, however, its easy oxidation and dissolution limited application widely. We proposed to construct a heterostructure pseudocapacitive electrode, VN/MnOx, on a carbon sheet synthesized by C3N4 self&#8208;sacrifice method for supercapacitors. This method can avoid NH3 using and at the same time produce carbon material. The manganese content can be adjusted to decrease the bandgap, resulting in conductivity improvements and fast electrochemical kinetic, then enhancing the electrochemical performance. The optimized C/VN/MnOx can deliver a maximum specific capacitance of 424 F g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1, higher than C/VN&#8208;700 (150 F g&#8722;1). Further, the assembled Ni(OH)2//C/VN/MnOx&#8208;700&#8208;1 device also exhibits high energy density of 37.05&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, with an excellent cycle life of 84% after 20,000 cycles, which will further promote the application of VN in supercapacitors. This work provides a new method of ammonia&#8208;free synthesis route and constructs a heterostructure pseudocapacitive electrode to achieve high specific capacitance, advancing the practical application of VN&#8208;based materials in high&#8208;performance supercapacitors.

         <title>Iridium Complexes Based on 1H&#8208;imidazo[4,5&#8208;f][1,10]Phenanthroline Ligand: Photophysical Properties and Light&#8208;Emitting Electrochemical Cells Characterization</title>

ABSTRACT
Cyclometallated Ir(III) complexes are extensively used in luminescent devices such as Light&#8208;Emitting Electrochemical Cells (LECs) due to their high stability and also high luminescence quantum yields. To increase the promising complexes for LEC applications, efforts are focused on the design of molecules with specific ligands that can modulate the emission color as well as the nature of the excited state from which radiative decays occur. In this context, this work presents a study of the luminescent properties of two new Ir(III) complexes containing a ligand derived from 1H&#8208;imidazo[4, 5&#8208;f][1,10]phenanthroline (dmbip). This study, complemented by theoretical DFT calculations and electrochemical characterizations, shows that, in solution, both Ir(III) complexes exhibit the same emission energy as that of the free dmbip ligand. However, in the solid state, the complexes exhibit phosphorescent emission with a marked red shift of nearly 100&#160;nm relative to their performance in solution. This unusual behavior is due to the presence of a luminescent 3ILCT excited state in the solid state, whose population is favored by the heavy metal center. Furthermore, these complexes were characterized in LEC devices and displayed the same emission profile identified in solid&#8208;state photoluminescence.

         <title>Donor&#8208;Acceptor Organic Electrode Materials: Regulating Molecular Orbital Energy Levels Toward Efficient Dual&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept highlights the emerging role of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) molecular engineering in addressing two intrinsic challenges for organic electrode materials in dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs): insufficient active&#8208;site density and intrinsically low electronic conductivity. The structure&#8211;property relationships of D&#8208;A organic electrode materials have been analyzed that enabling simultaneous improvements in energy and power density. Concrete research directions for D&#8208;A organic electrodes for practical DIB applications have been proposed.








Abstract
Organic electrode materials (OEMs)&#8208;based Dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs) have emerged as next&#8208;generation energy storage technologies due to their high operational voltage, environmental benignity, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Nevertheless, conventional OEMs remain constrained by poor conductivity and insufficient active sites, resulting in inadequate energy/power density for practical applications. This concept focuses on the design and implementation of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) structured organic electrodes, with a comprehensive review of their performance optimization mechanisms and research advancements in DIBs. Molecular D&#8208;A engineering enables precise modulation of electronic structures, energy&#8208;level alignment, and charge transport pathways, substantially enhancing electrode redox activity, conductivity, and ion storage kinetics. Finally, the future research directions of DIBs and system compatibility studies are prospected, and a theoretical framework and technical roadmaps for the development of high&#8208;energy/power&#8208;density organic DIBs are presented.

         <title>Remote Chirality Transfer and Amplification in a Self&#8208;assembly of &#945;&#8208;Cyanostilbene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A C3 symmetrical &#945;&#8208;cyanostilbene containing monomer self&#8208;assembles into helical fibres with remarkable remote chirality transfer and amplification, which greatly enhanced its CPL activity both in the assemblies and in the solid state. Energy transfer relay systems with dyes effectively harvest the energy and further enhance the CPL of the assemblies.








ABSTRACT
Chirality transfer and amplification are prevailing in biological systems, which play vital roles in the homochirality of life. Systems with remote chirality transfer and amplification remain actively pursued, aiming to construct novel chiral materials for advanced applications. Chiral supramolecular assembly stands out as a promising way to construct molecular assemblies through multiple synergistic noncovalent interactions, which enable the construction of various chiral materials. Here, we have developed a novel chiral monomer that was able to self&#8208;assemble in nonpolar solvents and afforded chiral fibers. The self&#8208;assembly process was found to be tuned by solvent composition and concentration. The self&#8208;assembly kinetics were affected by solvents and concentrations as well. The chirality can be transferred from the remote chiral center at the peripheries of the compound to the center of the molecule and was amplified during the self&#8208;assembly process via helical stacking of the adjacent monomers. Furthermore, CPL and energy transfer relay systems were also successfully realized with the chiral self&#8208;assemblies.

         <title>Metal Encapsulation Engineered Aromaticity Modulation: Transforming Cyclo[16]Carbon From Dual Antiaromaticity to Conflicting or Dual Aromaticity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT calculations demonstrate aromaticity modulation in C16 via metal encapsulation, establishing a paradigm for precise aromaticity engineering in carbon nanorings.








ABSTRACT
The inherent instability of a recently synthesized cyclo[16]carbon (C16) ring, arising from its dual antiaromatic 4n &#960;&#8208;electron systems, is strategically mitigated through encapsulation of light lanthanides (La&#8208;Nd) and actinide metals (Th&#8208;Np). This approach transforms C16&#8217;s dual antiaromaticity into tunable aromatic or conflicting aromatic states. The magnitude of aromatic character induced by metal encapsulation reveals an evolution trend that correlates with metal reducibility, thereby offering insights into the interactions between f&#8208;block metals and carbon&#8208;based materials. Multifaceted computational analyses, including topological, natural population, interaction region indicator (IRI), and spin density assessments, demonstrate that metal confinement fundamentally reconstructs the &#960; electron distribution. Crucially, light actinides (Th&#8208;Np) impart dual aromaticity through uniform electron delocalization and bond&#8208;length equalization, while lanthanides (La&#8208;Nd) induce conflicting aromaticity. Frontier molecular orbital and magnetically induced current analyses provide definitive evidence for these metal&#8208;dependent electronic transitions. We thus establish a metal&#8208;encapsulation paradigm for precise aromaticity engineering in carbon nanorings, unlocking transformative pathways for&#160;tailored quantum materials and single&#8208;molecule electronics.

         <title>A Multivariate Correlation Analysis Method Identifying Key Synthetic Parameters of Nickel Nanocatalysts Active in H2 Production From Ammonia&#8208;Borane Solvolysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A methodological approach based on a multivariate correlation analysis is described and employed to decipher prevalent parameters in the efficient synthesis of active colloidal nickel nanocatalysts used in H2 delivery from hydrolysis and methanolysis of ammonia&#8208;borane under mild conditions. This textbook example illustrates how to apply data science to formalize catalyst optimization for a given reaction.








ABSTRACT
The control of the properties of functional nanoparticles (NPs) requires rational adjustment of the parameters in their synthesis. However, the systematic study of all the experimental parameters for a given protocol generates data that can be intricate to handle and interpret. We address herein the development of a methodological approach to optimizing synthesis/structure of functional nanoobjects. Principal component analysis and correlation matrix evidence the prevalent synthetic parameters and their possible correlation. We develop 2D&#8208;size plots visual graphic tool from statistical treatment of NPs by microscopy. We applied these tools in a textbook case dedicated to the synthesis of colloidal Ni nanocatalysts used for H2 delivery from the solvolysis of ammonia&#8208;borane (AB) under mild conditions. As a result of the multivariate correlation analysis approach, we established the key role of the precursor nature in the synthesis, that mainly governed the size, dispersity and crystallinity of the formed NPs. At different examination scale, the clustering analysis of subpopulation of formed NPs or the electronic topology analysis of the molecular precursors were achieved. The difference in nanocatalysts performances is correlated to differences in crystallinity, which in turn comes from the nature of the precursors used. The methodological approach proposed here, focused at colloidal Ni NPs used for H2 delivery, reinforces the role of data science for the development and optimization of nanomaterials.

         <title>1,5&#8208;Conjugate Addition: A Potentially Valuable Synthetic Tool</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A brief summary on the concept development, recent advances, application, mechanism, and perspective on the limitation and future trend is described for 1,5&#8208;conjugate addition reaction as a newly emerged transformation pathway.








ABSTRACT
Different from well&#8208;known 1,4&#8208; and 1,6&#8208;conjugate addition reactions, umpolung 1,5&#8208;addition is considered electronically mismatched and is rarely explored. With palladium hydride catalysis, 1,5&#8208;addition was recently proved to be feasible. Diverse types of C&#8208;, O&#8208;, and N&#8208;based nucleophiles can be enantioselectively introduced to the &#947;&#8208;position of electron&#8208;deficient conjugated dienes. A series of privileged cyclic structures can also be conveniently prepared through 1,5&#8208;addition&#8208;involved cascade processes with high stereocontrol. This article provides a perspective on the concept development and advancement of 1,5&#8208;conjugate addition, which has gradually emerged as a new synthetic model.

         <title>Construction of Covalent Organic Cages for Molecular Recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The covalent organic cage (COC) is a significant concern for molecular recognition due to its preorganized 3D cavities, customizable binding sites, and outstanding chemical stability. Here, this concept article briefly summarizes the common COCs construction strategies and demonstrates how condensation of these COCs influences the encapsulation of various guests.








ABSTRACT
Molecular recognition is a crucial process in multiple areas, including separation, storage, and catalysis etc. Covalent organic cages (COCs), owing to their preorganized 3D cavities, customizable binding sites, and outstanding chemical stability, have been widely used for molecular recognition. Among the components of COCs, the covalent linkers play a crucial role in molecular recognition by shaping cavities and providing noncovalent interactions. In this concept, we exemplified recent progress in COC&#8208;based host&#8208;guest recognition, briefly summarized the bonding strategies (both dynamic and irreversible) used in covalent linkers for COC construction, and discussed how these linkers influence guest encapsulation by adjusting size, shape, and binding sites of their cavities. These insights are expected to provide a reference for the design of novel COCs for molecular recognition.

         <title>Unraveling the Role of Azobenzene&#8208;Based Photoswitchable Lipids in Controlling Innate Immune Response</title>

We have shown the effect of photoswitchable azobenzene&#8208;based lipids on the TIM&#8208;3&#8208;mediated activation of the immune system.








Abstract
The control of the activation of the innate immune response, notably by using suitable visible light sources, may lead the way to the development of phototimmunotherapeutic strategies. In this contribution we analyze the effects of the E/Z interconversion on a phosphatidyl serine lipid containing an isomerizable azobenzene moiety, which has recently been shown to regulate the activation of natural killer cells and the production of cytokines [J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2022, 144, 3863&#160;&#8722;&#160;3874]. In particular, we analyze the differential interactions of the innate immune system TIM&#8208;3 sensors. We show, resorting to long&#8208;range molecular dynamic simulations including enhanced sampling, that the Z isomer leads to a slight decrease of the binding free energy coupled with a less pronounced rigidification of the protein compared to the E isomer and the native lipid, justifying its less pronounced activation of the immune response.

         <title>Mechanochemical Stereoselective Povarov Reaction via Br&#248;nsted Acid Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 69, December 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical activation enables the synthesis of chiral tetrahydroquinolines with excellent enantioselectivity and good yield. This asymmetric Povarov reaction is efficiently catalyzed via BINOL&#8208;based chiral Br&#248;nsted acid organocatalysts. Mechanistic investigation confirmed a stepwise reaction mechanism, and DFT calculations provided insight into stereoinduction.








Abstract
Mechanochemically&#8208;assisted multicomponent Povarov reaction catalyzed by chiral BINOL&#8208;derived TRIP organocatalyst enabled the stereoselective synthesis of various tetrahydroquinolines in good yields and high enantiomeric purities. This represents a new example for the thus far less explored stereoselective transformations under mechanochemical conditions utilizing noncovalent asymmetric organocatalysis. A series of conventional and alternative solvents was tested for the liquid&#8208;assisted grinding. The solvent additive has a considerable influence on the stereocontrol of the reaction. The mechanochemical reaction setup offers better mass intensity values than the solution&#8208;based variant. The isolation of the addition intermediate and significant effect of solvent polarity suggests a stepwise polar mechanism. DFT calculation provided insights into the stereoinduction of the reaction.

         <title>Acyclic Nucleoside Phosphonates As Potential Inhibitors of Plasmodium Falciparum Egress</title>

         <dc:description>
Exploration of the chemistry of acyclic nucleoside phosphonates allowed us to study structural diversity from the hit compound; biological evaluation and molecular docking were performed to decipher key interactions with the putative target.








Abstract
The emergence of drug&#8208;resistant Plasmodium strains requires the development of novel antimalarial agents with original mechanisms of action. Here, we report the synthesis and biological evaluation of a new family of nucleotide analogues aiming to target an essential step of the development of the malaria parasite.

&lt;p&gt;Exploration of the chemistry of acyclic nucleoside phosphonates allowed us to study structural diversity from the hit compound; biological evaluation and molecular docking were performed to decipher key interactions with the putative target.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emergence of drug-resistant Plasmodium strains requires the development of novel antimalarial agents with original mechanisms of action. Here, we report the synthesis and biological evaluation of a new family of nucleotide analogues aiming to target an essential step of the development of the malaria parasite. Two series of acyclic nucleoside phosphonates were designed to incorporate strategic structural modifications either on the purine scaffold or on the acyclic chain. All synthesized compounds were evaluated against chloroquine-sensitive (3D7) Plasmodium falciparum strains. A few compounds demonstrated in vitro antimalarial activity with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values ranging from 11.3 to38.8 &#181;M. In addition, a molecular docking study revealed some crucial interactions with the putative target and supports the biological data. The present study establishes this novel family of nucleotide analogues as promising antimalarial scaffolds, warranting further optimization and evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Fluorido difluoroamido complexes F'MNF2 of heavy alkaline earth metals (M&#160;=&#160;Ca, Sr, Ba) were prepared through the reactions of laser&#8208;ablated metal atoms with NF3 and isolated under cryogenic conditions in neon and argon matrices. The species feature a F'&#8722;&#8722; and a side&#8208;on coordinated &#951;3&#8208;NF2&#8722; ligand with the F'&#8722;M&#8722;N angle decreasing from calcium to barium.








Abstract
Fluorido difluoroamido complexes F'MNF2 of heavy alkaline earth metals (M&#160;=&#160;Ca, Sr, Ba) were prepared through the reactions of laser&#8208;ablated metal atoms with diluted NF3 and isolated in cryogenic neon and argon matrices. They were characterized using Fourier&#8208;transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, 14/15NF3 isotopic substitution and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. The species feature a F'&#8722; and a so far unknown side&#8208;on coordinated &#951;3&#8208;NF2&#8722; ligand with the F'&#8722;M&#8722;N angle decreasing from Ca to Ba. Bonding analyses suggest that the interactions between the metal center and the ligands are mainly of electrostatic nature. Nevertheless, the orbital interaction shows that an electron donation from the ligands into the empty ns and (n &#8211; 1)d orbitals of the metal center further contributes to the electronic structure.

         <title>A Subtle Change in Linker Structure can Greatly Affect Cross&#8208;Linking Efficiency of a Quinone Methide Conjugate</title>

Naphthalimide directs a bisquinone methide precursor to the major groove of DNA and a subtle change in a linker atom (Y) has a dramatic effect on the reaction efficiency.








Abstract
The generality of delivering a bisquinone methide precursor to the major groove of DNA was tested with two naphthalimide conjugates differing in a single amide versus ester linkage. Both demonstrated an ability to cross&#8208;link duplex DNA. Although a difference in their efficiency was not anticipated, the amide&#8208;containing derivative consistently generated more cross&#8208;linking than its ester&#8208;containing analogue when tested with four different sequences of duplex DNA and one analogous RNA duplex. Both conjugates exhibited a specificity for a 5&#8242;&#8208;&#8230;GTGTGT&#8230;&#8208;3&#8242; sequence in the absence of the preferred target of 5&#8242;&#8208;GC and 5&#8242;&#8208;CG. A corresponding conjugate containing acridine in place of naphthalimide did not express a sequence specificity and cross&#8208;linked the test duplexes with an average efficiency similar to the median of that produced by the amide containing naphthalimide conjugate. With the plethora of naphthalimides available for cellular imaging and chemotherapy, quinone methide delivery may now be designed for many targets of choice. However, a variety of linkers should be surveyed to account for their surprising influence on cross&#8208;linking.

         <title>Elucidating the Role of NaCl in the on&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Conjugated Azaacene Polymers on Au(111)</title>

NaCl&#8208;assisted on&#8208;surface reaction on Au(111): NaCl decomposition yields Na adatoms that form metal&#8211;organic complexes, which stabilize the organic precursor, steering aryl&#8211;aryl coupling.








Abstract
On&#8208;surface synthesis (OSS) offers unique opportunities for fabricating carbon&#8208;based nanostructures that are unattainable by conventional wet&#8208;chemical synthesis. Despite OSS being extremely successful, the use of coadsorbates to promote reactions remains largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate the role of sodium chloride (NaCl) in promoting the Scholl reaction (oxidative aryl&#8211;aryl coupling) of hexaazatriphenylene (HAT) molecules on Au(111), leading to the growth of conjugated azaacene oligomers. Using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we shed light on the reaction mechanism and the intermediates involved. Upon codeposition on Au(111), NaCl decomposes on the surface, releasing Na atoms that form thermally stable metal&#8208;organic complexes, enhancing precursor stability against desorption. This stabilizing effect allows HAT molecules to undergo regioselective intermolecular coupling for polymerization at elevated temperatures. This study highlights the role of alkali metals in on&#8208;surface chemical reactions and outlines a strategy for overcoming the precursor&#8208;desorption issue.

         <title>Investigating Metal and Fluorophore Controlled Intracellular Localization in Noble Metal Thiosemicarbazone Complexes</title>

Same ligand, same dye, different metal: Thiosemicarbazone conjugates of Pt and Pd show distinctly different localization patterns inside mammalian cells.








Abstract
Transition metal complexes have been widely utilized as cellular imaging tools. To impart organelle specificity, ligand architecture is usually modified to modulate properties like overall charge and lipophilicity. In many such designs, the metal identity and its intrinsic properties are often ignored. To address this gap, in this study, we explored the effects of changing the metal center on the localization patterns of isostructural complexes. To this end, we employed the thiosemicarbazone Dp44mT to synthesize coumarin&#8208;conjugated complexes of Au(III), Pt(II), and Pd(II). Although the metal centers in these compounds share a formal d8 configuration, they differ in properties such as ionic radius, charge density, and ligand exchange rates, which can affect their subcellular localization patterns. In addition, we synthesized a second set of analogous complexes using BODIPY as the conjugating fluorophore to assess the influence of using a different dye on the cellular distribution. Confocal imaging revealed that the complexes exhibited distinct intracellular distributions. For instance, while the coumarin&#8208;conjugated Pt(II) complex localized specifically in lysosomes, the corresponding lipophilic Pd(II) complex lacked this specificity and instead followed a diffusely cytosolic distribution. Similarly, the more lipophilic BODIPY conjugated complexes were non&#8208;specific in their cellular distribution as well. Overall, the findings of this study highlight the interplay of metal identity and lipophilicity in determining the localization patterns of Dp44mT&#8208;based metal complexes, offering fresh insights into the design of new metal&#8208;based imaging tools.

         <title>Reduced&#8208;Symmetry Homoleptic Pd2L4 Cages Stabilized by Noncovalent &#960;&#8208;Interactions</title>

A symmetric bipyridyl ligand LF bearing an endohedrally&#8208;pendant pentafluorobenzyl ether guides the self&#8208;assembly process to yield low&#8208;symmetry, homoleptic lantern&#8208;type Pd2LF4 cages as it adopts a single, low&#8208;symmetry conformer&#8212;stabilized by both &#960;&#8208;stacking and tetrafluoroborate encapsulation&#8212;as demonstrated by crystallographic and spectroscopic characterization.








Abstract
Low symmetry molecular cages are synthetically challenging yet may have important applications. Symmetry in coordination cages is typically broken by repulsive design leveraging steric clashes, geometric mismatches, or orthogonal ligands. Here, we demonstrate a contrasting strategy exploiting attractive &#960;&#8208;interactions from a sole symmetric bipyridyl ligand LF bearing an endohedrally&#8208;pendant pentafluorobenzyl ether to guide the self&#8208;assembly of low&#8208;symmetry, homoleptic cages. Ligand LF formed lantern&#8208;type Pd2L4 cages that adopt a single, low&#8208;symmetry conformer&#8212;stabilized by both &#960;&#8208;stacking and tetrafluoroborate encapsulation&#8212;demonstrated by crystallographic and spectroscopic characterization. Cage assembly with LF contrasted the control assembly lacking fluorination (LH), which formed dynamic, less&#8208;defined structures, underscoring the essential role of &#960;&#8208;interactions in both structural selection and kinetic stability. These findings introduce a new design paradigm: using minimal, attractive forces to direct symmetry and dynamics of supramolecular architectures.

         <title>15&#160;N Reaction Monitoring at Low and Inhomogeneous Magnetic Fields Enabled by Hyperpolarization with Parahydrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 69, December 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
15&#160;N reaction monitoring at low and inhomogeneous fields enabled by PHIP. The concept was demonstrated at a magnetic field of 66 mT and 81&#160;ppm inhomogeneity. Specifically, we measured the conversion of 15N&#8208;boronobenzyl&#8208;2&#8208;styrylpyridinium to 15N&#8208;2&#8208;styrylpyridin. This enables the detection of H2O2 with high sensitivity and selectivity, exhibiting a significant chemical shift difference of 88.4&#160;ppm.








Abstract
The combination of hyperpolarization methods with low and inhomogeneous fields promises to expand the application of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to fields that nowadays are not standard. Reducing the magnetic field strengths and homogeneity requirements opens the door to a wide variety of magnet designs that can allow for monitoring chemical reactions in the benchtop or even larger reactors. In this work, we propose a method to monitor 15&#160;N chemical reactions at low and inhomogeneous fields based on parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization. The concept was demonstrated at a magnetic field of 66 mT and 81&#160;ppm inhomogeneity. Specifically, we measured the conversion of 15N&#8208;boronobenzyl&#8208;2&#8208;styrylpyridinium (15N&#8208;BBSP) to 15N&#8208;2&#8208;styrylpyridin (15N&#8208;SP). This enables the detection of H2O2 with high sensitivity and selectivity, exhibiting a significant chemical shift difference of 88.4&#160;ppm, when 15N&#8208;SP is obtained after a base&#8208;assisted 1,6 elimination/rearrangement. The long T1 of 15N&#8208;BBSP at low magnetic fields (194 s at 100 mT) exemplifies the potential of hyperpolarized 15&#160;N for low field applications. We envision the implementation of our methods for studying chemical reactions in benchtop devices, drug screening, investigating biological systems in their native environments, preclinical research and contrast development for low&#8208;field and portable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

         <title>Bistability in Palladium Complexes with Two Different Redox&#8208;Active Ligands of Orthogonal Charge Regimes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 69, December 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By assembling a redox&#8208;active guanidine ligand together with a dioxolene ligand in cationic Pd complexes, bistable systems are formed in which the two redox isomers differ significantly in their dipole moment. The barrier for electron transfer is small, and the equilibrium can be shifted by change of the solvent polarity.








Abstract
Electronically bistable molecular coordination compounds are obtained by a combination of two different redox&#8208;active ligands with orthogonal charge regimes in square&#8208;planar palladium complexes. Thereby, the first complexes are obtained in which two redox isomers are interconverted by interligand electron transfer between a catecholato/semiquinonato (dioxolene) ligand and a redox&#8208;active guanidine (GFA) ligand. Experiments in alliance with quantum&#8208;chemical calculations indicate that the barrier between the two states is relatively small. Due to the significantly different dipole moments of the two redox isomers, the intramolecular electron transfer can be triggered by variations in the solvent polarity. The energy difference between the two redox isomers and thus the ratio of their formation can be tuned by modifications at the dioxolene and GFA ligands.

Friedel&#8211;Crafts Arylation of Indoles: Use of an iminosulfonate derivative as the photoacid generator for the Friedel&#8211;Crafts arylation reaction between aldehydes and indoles under inert atmosphere.








ABSTRACT
Photochemistry enables transformations inaccessible through ground&#8208;state pathways. We report a sustainable and operationally simple Friedel&#8211;Crafts arylation using benzophenone oxime tosylate, in low catalyst loading, as the photoacid generator under inert conditions. The method accommodates a broad substrate scope, affording diarylmethane derivatives in good to excellent yields. Mechanistic studies elucidate key intermediates driving the transformation.

         <title>Simultaneous Grafting of 3,4,5&#8208;Trihydroxypiperidine Iminosugars Onto Multivalent Scaffolds via Double Reductive Amination Provides New GCase Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small set of low&#8208;valency multivalent 3,4,5&#8208;trihydroxypiperidines was prepared through double reductive amination (DRA) of a sugar&#8208;derived dialdehyde. Among them, trivalent derivative 37 emerged as a potent &#946;&#8208;glucocerebrosidase (GCase) inhibitor displaying an unexpected mixed&#8208;type kinetic profile. The integration of kinetic analysis, NMR, docking, and MD simulations shed light on the molecular basis of the binding to the target enzyme.








ABSTRACT
Low&#8208;valency multivalent iminosugars have recently emerged as promising inhibitors of the therapeutically relevant enzyme &#946;&#8208;glucocerebrosidase (GCase). A new synthetic strategy has been developed to simultaneously build more than one trihydroxypiperidine iminosugar unit onto a polyamine scaffold via double reductive amination (DRA) of a d&#8208;mannose derived dialdehyde. Five divalent derivatives, using both aliphatic and aromatic diamines and a trivalent compound based on an aromatic scaffold have been synthesized and evaluated as GCase inhibitors. Only oligomers with an aromatic core (26, 31, and 37) strongly inhibit GCase with IC50 values in the low micromolar range and activity enhancements, when compared to the monovalent counterpart, that confirm the occurrence of a positive multivalent effect. Kinetic analysis for divalent 31 and trivalent 37 revealed a mixed&#8208;type inhibition. To rationalize the unexpected behavior of 37, an integrated biophysical and computational approach based on STD&#8208;NMR, docking, and MD simulations was employed, allowing to clarify the structural basis for its inhibitory profile and paving the way to the rational design of novel inhibitors able to bridge multiple interaction sites of the target enzyme.

&lt;p&gt;Low-valency multivalent iminosugars have recently emerged as promising inhibitors of the therapeutically relevant enzyme &#946;-glucocerebrosidase (GCase). A new synthetic strategy has been developed to simultaneously build more than one trihydroxypiperidine iminosugar unit onto a polyamine scaffold via double reductive amination (DRA) of a &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-mannose derived dialdehyde. Five divalent derivatives, using both aliphatic and aromatic diamines and a trivalent compound based on an aromatic scaffold have been synthesized and evaluated as GCase inhibitors. Only oligomers with an aromatic core (&lt;b&gt;26&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;31&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;37&lt;/b&gt;) strongly inhibit GCase with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values in the low micromolar range and activity enhancements, when compared to the monovalent counterpart, that confirm the occurrence of a positive multivalent effect. Kinetic analysis for divalent &lt;b&gt;31&lt;/b&gt; and trivalent &lt;b&gt;37&lt;/b&gt; revealed a mixed-type inhibition. To rationalize the unexpected behavior of &lt;b&gt;37&lt;/b&gt;, an integrated biophysical and computational approach based on STD-NMR, docking, and MD simulations was employed, allowing to clarify the structural basis for its inhibitory profile and paving the way to the rational design of novel inhibitors able to bridge multiple interaction sites of the target enzyme.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multistate Azobenzene&#8211;Norbornadiene Photoswitches for Molecular Solar Thermal Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Systems consisting of two different photoswitches (azobenzene and norbornadiene) are presented, which can be switched by light, store energy, and release it again. The combination of the switching units leads to synergistic effects.








ABSTRACT
The combination of two photochromic molecules into a multimodal photoswitch offers the potential to generate new properties related to molecular solar thermal (MOST) systems. A system can only be considered suitable for MOST applications if it meets key criteria, including a high quantum yield and an extended half&#8208;life of the high&#8208;energy isomer. Achieving this combination remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present the coupling of an azobenzene unit (AZO) with a norbornadiene system (NBD) via ester functions to develop new bi&#8208; and trimodal AZO&#8208;NBD photoswitches that exhibit synergistic effects. Photochemical studies reveal that both the NBD and AZO components of the hybrid are switchable. In one case, all isomer types could be selectively produced. Furthermore, each metastable unit can be switched back independently to its corresponding thermodynamically stable form. The quantum yields and half&#8208;lives for the NBD and AZO components of the hybrid system could be determined separately. The integration of AZOs has demonstrated the potential to extend the half&#8208;lives of NBDs to up to 122 days in certain cases, as confirmed through comparative analysis with reference systems. The enhanced rate of back&#8208;conversion was further facilitated by the presence of TFA as a catalyst.

         <title>Next Generation Hosts for Protein Recognition, Assembly and More</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The original design of synthetic receptors for proteins was based on macrocycles with a hydrophobic core and a polar/charged periphery. This design, geared towards protein recognition, facilitates receptor self&#8208;assembly. Macrocycle oligomerization, in turn, contributes to protein assembly as evidenced in many cocrystal structures. Future synthetic receptors that expand on this principle may prove useful in fabricating new types of biomaterials.








ABSTRACT
This Perspective describes an apparent transition in the design and function of synthetic receptors for proteins. It is shown that the original receptor design, geared toward protein recognition, lends itself also to receptor self&#8208;assembly and concomitant protein assembly. While evidence for this effect has lain somewhat dormant for two decades, numerous recent examples raise interesting possibilities for innovation in protein binding, encapsulation, and crystal engineering. In a bid to inspire future research and collaboration, I speculate on new receptor designs. Considering current developments with nanocarbon hosts, anionic variants might facilitate protein assembly and the bottom&#8208;up fabrication of hybrid materials.

         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive summary of key computational methods, databases, and tools, along with practical guidance to facilitate the application of artificial intelligence in drug target discovery.








ABSTRACT
The identification of drug targets remains one of the most critical challenges in pharmaceutical research. The rapid progress of artificial intelligence (AI) is significantly advancing this landscape by enabling more efficient and accurate drug&#8208;target interaction prediction. AI&#8208;driven approaches can integrate and analyze massive biomedical datasets, elucidating complex signaling networks and providing systematic insights into drug mechanisms of action. These developments have greatly accelerated virtual screening, binding affinity estimation, and target identification. However, despite these advancements, key challenges persist, such as ensuring the precision of predictions and overcoming the barriers to integrating AI tools with drug target discovery. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent public databases, advanced computational methods, and user&#8208;friendly AI tools, highlighting both their potential and challenges. It also offers practical guidance for researchers without computational expertise, illustrating how these technologies can be effectively incorporated into current research workflows to advance drug target discovery and ultimately accelerate the development of novel therapeutic drugs.

         <title>The One&#8208;Step Synthesis of Biologically Active Isochromans from Lignin&#8208;Derived Aromatic Monomers in Tunable Deep Eutectic Solvents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward one&#8208;step protocol enables the synthesis of bio&#8208;based and biologically active isochromans through the Oxa&#8208;Pictet cyclization involving diverse aldehydes, including vanillin in combination with lignin&#8208;derivable homovanillyl alcohol, a prominent aromatic platform chemical obtainable via diol&#8208;assisted fractionation of lignocellulose, employing tunable deep eutectic solvents as benign reaction media.








ABSTRACT
Clean synthetic strategies that embrace the inherent structural features of renewable building blocks to obtain biologically active compounds hold great potential to improve the economic viability of emerging biorefineries. Importantly, such an approach is highly beneficial for the sustainable manufacturing of pharmaceutically relevant molecules. Here, we demonstrate a one&#8208;step protocol toward biologically active isochromans through the Oxa&#8208;Pictet cyclization involving both aromatic aldehydes, including vanillin, and aliphatic aldehydes in combination with lignin&#8208;derivable homovanillyl alcohol (1), a prominent aromatic platform chemical obtainable via diol&#8208;assisted fractionation. Employing tunable deep eutectic solvents as benign reaction media allows for modulating reactivity under mild reaction conditions, and opens access to a library of isochromans in a single step. Several compounds exhibit promising properties, including PPI inhibition, anticancer, and antibacterial activities, highlighting the benefits of this synthetic strategy and its potential for drug discovery.

         <title>Strategies for Enhancing SiO2 Chemical&#8208;Mechanical Polishing (CMP): Functional Nanoparticle Abrasive Design and Integration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Progress in SiO2 chemical mechanical polishing is increasingly driven by functional nanoparticle abrasives. This review surveys materials beyond ceria including silica, alumina, zirconia, titania, and nonoxides emphasizing how morphology, size, composition, and friction mechanism control can be engineered to improve removal rate, selectivity, and surface quality in advanced integrated circuit fabrication.








ABSTRACT
With the continuous scaling and integration of semiconductor devices, the demand for advanced chemical&#8208;mechanical polishing (CMP) has increased significantly. Consequently, the limitations of conventional abrasives have become increasingly evident, prompting a growing need for next&#8208;generation slurries with improved material removal rates, surface roughness, defectivity, and selectivity. This review investigates the physicochemical properties of both ceria&#8208;based and nonceria&#8208;based nanoparticle abrasives and critically examines recent advances in their application to SiO2 CMP. Emphasis is placed on understanding how these materials contribute to performance enhancement through chemical interactions, mechanical properties, and structural design. Our findings suggest that overcoming the limitations of the existing slurry systems may require a paradigm shift from relying on single&#8208;component abrasives to engineering composite systems with complementary functionalities. Such integrated abrasive design strategies present a practical route toward more reliable and effective CMP solutions for future semiconductor fabrication.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Approach for the Synthesis of Contorted Nanographenes by Cp*Co(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Annulative&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Extension&#8208;Cyclization Cascade</title>

An unprecedented bottom&#8208;up strategy for the rapid construction of PAHs is developed by employing arene&#8208;derived ketones and carbon&#8208;rich 1,3&#8208;diynes. Many of these synthesized PAHs have tilted &#960;&#8208;electronic structure, unique edges and topologies. Electronic nature of the 1,3&#8208;diynes guided the final mode of cyclization leading to the formal fusing of one fluorene moiety via 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization or phenanthrene nucleus through 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization.








ABSTRACT
In the domain of bottom&#8208;up approach, regioselective fusion of aromatic moiety onto an arene templet remains scarcely explored, yet represents a crucial tool for the rapid generation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). An unprecedented bottom&#8208;up strategy for the rapid construction of PAHs is developed by employing arene&#8208;derived ketones and carbon&#8208;rich 1,3&#8208;diynes. Many of these synthesized PAHs have tilted &#960;&#8208;electronic structure, unique edges and topologies. A range of arene&#8208;derived ketones participated in this annulative&#8208;&#960;&#8208;extension&#8208;cyclization cascade under first&#8208;row Co(III)&#8208;catalysis. Electronic nature of the 1,3&#8208;diynes guided the final mode of cyclization leading to the formal fusing of one fluorene moiety via 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization or phenanthrene nucleus through 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization. Intermediate ethynyl&#8208;PAHs were also isolated in case of relatively electron&#8208;deficient diynes. The contorted &#960;&#8208;planes of the synthesized PAHs were elucidated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. Detailed DFT studies reinforce the proposed mechanistic pathway, validating the formation of the major regioisomer of PAHs. Furthermore, less aromatic character of fluorene moiety over phenanthrene nucleus is supported by the NICS(1)zz and ACID calculations.

         <title>Evolved DNAzymes and Stable Activation Chemistry Enable High&#8208;Efficiency DNA Ligation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In vitro selection of pre&#8208;structured DNA libraries and chemical screening of alternative activation groups yielded trans&#8208;acting DNAzymes with faster ligation rates and enhanced DNA substrate stability. The combination of C3S1 DNAzymes and phosphobenzimidazole&#8208;activated DNA substrates provides improved DNA ligation performance, offering promise for applications such as DNA data storage.








ABSTRACT
DNA ligation is a fundamental reaction used in a variety of applications, typically performed by T4 DNA ligase. For certain applications, such as DNA data storage, DNA&#8208;ligating DNAzymes offer a more stable and cost&#8208;effective alternative to protein enzymes. The E47 DNAzyme is among the most efficient DNA&#8208;ligating DNAzymes reported, but it still lacks sufficient activity for widespread adoption and requires a highly unstable phosphoimidazole&#8208;activated DNA substrate to function. In this study, we performed in vitro selection using a pre&#8208;structured library based on E47 and identified sequences with more than a twofold increase in ligation activity, representing the fastest DNA&#8208;ligating DNAzymes reported to date. We also screened alternative imidazolide compounds for substrate activation and found that phosphobenzimidazole&#8208;activated DNA substrates are significantly more stable, remaining intact for at least 24 h at room temperature. These advances improve the practicality of DNAzymes for ligation&#8208;based applications and broaden their potential use in DNA data storage.

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Aggregation of Amphiphilic Monomers&#8212;Cyclic and Tubular Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Self&#8208;assembly in Conventional and Polar Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new hydrogen&#8208;bonding monomers, TEG&#8208;UPy and TEG&#8208;PUPy, featuring tetraethylene glycol solubilizing chains (TEG) were synthesized and shown to self&#8208;assemble into tubular supramolecular structures in polar solvents. The (TEG&#8208;Upy)4 tetramer effectively encapsulates a C60 fullerene, forming a host&#8208;guest complex even in acetonitrile. The C60@(TEG&#8208;UPy)4 complex serves as an efficient photocatalyst for the oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides.








ABSTRACT
Two hydrogen&#8208;bonding monomers containing tetraethylene glycol (TEG) chains have been synthesized and characterized. The monomers are based on a bicyclic scaffold appended with either 4H&#8208;bonding benzyl&#8208;substituted ureidopyrimidinone motifs or 2H&#8208;bonding unsubstituted pyrrole&#8208;fused ureidopyrimidinone motifs, with the TEG chains introduced with the aim of developing amphiphilic monomers soluble in nonpolar and polar organic solvents in order to extend the utility of H&#8208;bonding in supramolecular chemistry. In CDCl3, both monomers formed cyclic tetramers. The monomer containing 2H&#8208;bonding motifs was found to form significantly less&#8208;stable aggregates than its previously reported alkylated analogue, most likely due to interference from the TEG chains. Despite the weaker aggregation, the 2H&#8208;bonded tetramers were able to stack into tubular polymers through orthogonal H&#8208;bonding in less polar solvent (toluene) or when a suitable guest (C70) was introduced. Comparison of the TEGylated monomers with previously reported alkylated analogues showed that the introduction of TEG chains resulted in increased solubility in a wide range of solvents. By using one of the TEGylated monomers, nonpolar C60 could be solubilized in polar solvent acetonitrile by forming an inclusion complex. This complex was used as a homogeneous catalyst for photochemical oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides in acetonitrile.

         <title>MXene@MOF Composites: Converging Synthesis Strategies, Structural Features, and Emerging Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents a comprehensive analysis of MXene@MOF composites, emphasizing their structural features, synthesis strategies, and rapidly expanding applications across supercapacitors, electrocatalytic water splitting, photocatalysis, and electrochemical sensing.








ABSTRACT
2D materials have attracted a lot of interest since the invention of graphene because of their remarkable qualities and adaptability. The distinct architectures and complementary qualities of MOFs (metal&#8211;organic frameworks) and MXenes offer intriguing prospects in various sectors. Derived from MAX phases, MXenes have hydrophilic surfaces, and excellent electrical conductivity. MOFs, on the other hand, provide large surface area, adjustable porosity, and diverse chemical functions. Nevertheless, there are drawbacks associated with&#160;both materials. MXenes are prone to oxidation and self&#8208;stacking, whereas MOFs have limited structural stability and poor electrical conductivity. The development of MXene@MOF composites provides a synergistic solution, combining the advantages of both materials while reducing their individual drawbacks. In this review, we highlight the most recent advances in MXene@MOF composites and provide a focused discussion on their unique structural features, emerging synthesis trends, and rapidly expanding applications. These elements distinguish this work from earlier reviews. This review systematically explores the structures and synthesis methods of these materials, including solvothermal, hydrothermal, and in&#8208;situ growth techniques, and examines their wide range of applications. Superior electron transport, high surface area, and improved structural stability lead to enhanced performance of MXene@MOF composites in supercapacitors, water splitting, photocatalysis, and sensing.

         <title>TiO2/FeCoS Heterojunction Anode for Fast&#8208;Charging Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Introducing FeCoS into TiO2 constructs a heterogeneous interface that enhances electron transport and accelerates lithium&#8208;ion diffusion by reducing the migration energy barrier, thus enabling rapid intercalation and deintercalation of lithium ions.








ABSTRACT
To develop fast&#8208;charging lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), optimizing insertion&#8208;type anode structure is crucial for achieving fast lithium&#8208;ion diffusion and high electronic conductivity. Here, we combine insertion&#8208;type TiO2 with high&#8208;capacity FeCoS to construct a TiO2/FeCoS heterojunction, which enhances electron/ion transport, lowers the ion diffusion energy barrier, and thereby improves quick&#8208;charging performance. The resulting anode exhibits a high reversible capacity of 627.7 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1, 2.3 times that of TiO2. Notably, it gives a remarkable capacity of 241.7 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10 A g&#8722;1 and maintains excellent stability over 10,000 cycles with an ultralow capacity decay of just 0.002% per cycle. Experiments and theoretical calculations confirm the superior performance originates from enhanced Li+ ions adsorption and reduced diffusion barrier at the heterointerface, which accelerates Li+ insertion/extraction kinetics. This work provides an effective pathway to accelerate electrochemical kinetics and enable fast&#8208;charging LIBs.

The resulting anode exhibits a high reversible capacity of 627.7 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, 2.3 times that of TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Notably, it gives a remarkable capacity of 241.7 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 10 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and maintains excellent stability over 10,000 cycles with an ultralow capacity decay of just 0.002% per cycle. Experiments and theoretical calculations confirm the superior performance originates from enhanced Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions adsorption and reduced diffusion barrier at the heterointerface, which accelerates Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; insertion/extraction kinetics. This work provides an effective pathway to accelerate electrochemical kinetics and enable fast-charging LIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;assembly and Lateral Cobalt Coordination of a Fivefold Symmetric Cyanostar Macrocycle on an Au(111) Surface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report the first example of the formation of a close&#8208;packed, regular 2D monolayer of a fivefold symmetric cyanostar macrocycle on an Au(111) surface under ultra&#8208;high vacuum and the structural modification of such self&#8208;assembled architecture upon cobalt atom deposition.








ABSTRACT
The functionalization of solid surfaces with responsive macrocyclic compounds is a key strategy for developing advanced functional materials, with applications in molecular sensing, catalysis, and nanoscale electronics. Here, we report the self&#8208;assembly and lateral cobalt coordination, on an Au(111) surface and under ultra&#8208;high vacuum conditions, of a fivefold symmetric cyanostar macrocycle, a class of anion recognition molecules. This represents the first example of a close&#8208;packed regular assembly of a pentagonal macrocycle at the solid&#8208;vacuum interface.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Coupled J&#8208;Aggregates Synergized With Hydrogen Bonding via Molecular Planarity Engineering for Second Near&#8208;Infrared Imaging and Phototherapy</title>

Abstract
A novel J&#8208;aggregates configuration, termed &#960;&#8211;&#960;&#8208;coupled J&#8208;aggregates, was successfully constructed based on low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight hemicyanine dyes (HCY&#8208;3). Unlike classical J&#8208;aggregates, the &#960;&#8211;&#960;&#8208;coupled J&#8208;aggregates are formed through synergistic &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions between monomeric molecules, The rigidified&#8208; molecular planar architecture not only avoids fluorescence quenching of the photosensitizer but also significantly broadens the bathochromic absorption band owing to enhanced conjugation effects while preserving photodynamic activity. As a result, a broad bathochromic absorption from 600&#160;nm to an absorption tail over 1100&#160;nm was achieved, allowing the photosensitizer to be compatible with a variety of laser sources. The enhanced&#8208;receptor conjugation significantly boosts singlet oxygen generation efficiency while reinforcing &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, endowing the J&#8208;aggregates with exceptional thermal stability, chemical stability, and photothermal generation capability. Under 980&#160;nm laser excitation, the &#960;&#8211;&#960;&#8208;coupled J&#8208;aggregations based on HCY&#8208;3 J&#8208;NPs exhibited excellent ROS generation capacity and NIR&#8208;II fluorescence emission, successfully achieving multimodal photothermal/photodynamic antitumor therapy guided by NIR&#8208;II FL imaging. Such &#960;&#8211;&#960;&#8208;coupled J&#8208;aggregates may represent a new route for the design of NIR&#8208;II photosensitizers.

         <title>Denaturation of Water in Alkaline Melts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vapor pressure measurements and ab initio molecular&#8208;dynamics simulations reveal that in ultra&#8208;alkaline media with base concentrations up to 70&#160;mol L&#8722;1, the activity of water is dramatically reduced by strong bonding interactions. These disrupt traditional hydrogen bonding patterns, alter vapor&#8208;liquid equilibria, and significantly change molecular coordination and proton dynamics.








ABSTRACT
Extremely high base concentrations (cB) in ultra&#8208;alkaline liquids, also known as hydroflux, alter the thermodynamic and structural properties of water. Mixtures of water and alkali (AOH, A&#160;=&#160;Na, K) with molar base ratios of q(A)&#160;=&#160;n(H2O):n(AOH) &#8804; 2:1 (cB &#8805; 25&#160;mol L&#8722;1) show an overproportionally reduced vapor pressure compared to more diluted systems. The vapor pressure of a melt with q(A)&#160;=&#160;0.8 (cB&#160;=&#160;70&#160;mol L&#8722;1) at 200&#176;C is negligible. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations revealed substantial structural reorganization of the hydrogen bonding network in the equimolar mixture of KOH and water. Distinctive molecular features included altered coordination geometries, shortened hydrogen bonds, and frequent proton transfer events, including Grotthuss diffusion, indicative of an altered hydrogen&#8208;bond network and increased proton mobility. Cluster population analysis shows that a significant number of H3O2&#8722; anions are present, which exhibit a near symmetrical hydrogen bond with O&#183;&#183;&#183;H distances &lt;1.28 &#197;. The hydroflux can be seen as an intermediate between an alkaline solution and a molten salt {K+&#183;H+&#183;2OH&#8211;}, in which the water has a vanishing chemical activity.
