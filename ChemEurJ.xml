         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Biphenyl&#8208;bridged &#949;&#8208;Sultams by Organocatalytic Mannich Reactions of Cyclic N&#8208;Sulfonylimines with Unactivated Ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly enantioselective Mannich reaction of biphenyl&#8208;bridged seven&#8208;membered cyclic N&#8208;sulfonylimines with methyl alkyl ketones is disclosed in this study. The reaction was performed under organocatalysis, using a quinine&#8208;derived primary amine as the catalyst in combination with a Br&#248;nsted acid as the co&#8208;catalyst. High yields (up to 89%) and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 97% ee) were observed. For methyl alkyl ketones containing a larger alkyl substituent, specific regioselective addition to the C=N bond is favoured at the methyl group. On the contrary, ketones containing a smaller alkyl substituent or hydroxyacetone substrates gave major syn selective Mannich products at the methylene group.</dc:description>

         <title>Supporting Electrolyte&#8208;Free Electrochemical Oxidative C&#8210;H Sulfonylation and Thiocyanation of Fused Pyrimidin&#8208;4&#8208;ones in an All&#8208;Green Electrolytic System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An electrooxidative C&#8210;H functionalization is a widely accepted route to obtain sulfur&#8208;containing arenes and heteroarenes. However, this process often involves using non&#8208;recyclable supporting electrolytes, (co)solvents like hexafluoroisopropanol, additives like acid, or catalysts. The use of additional reagents can increase costs and waste, reducing atom efficiency. Moreover, unlike other nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, there have only been sporadic reports of electrochemical C&#8210;H functionalization in fused pyrimidin&#8208;4&#8208;ones, and an electrolyte&#8208;free process has yet to be developed. We demonstrate that such anodic coupling reactions can be performed in an all&#8208;green electrolytic system without using such additional electrolytes or HFIP, maintaining a high atom economy. This C&#8210;H functionalization strategy utilizes inexpensive sodium sulfinates and ammonium thiocyanate as sulfonylating and thiocyanating agents in an undivided cell at a constant current, using a mixture of CH3CN/H2O as solvent at room temperature. Thus, fused pyrimidin&#8208;4&#8208;ones can be selectively converted into C3&#8208;sulfonylated and &#8208;thiocyanated derivatives in moderate to good yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Symmetrical and Mixed Tris(acyl)phosphines: Synthesis, Oxidation and Photochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;It was exciting to find out that there is an acylphosphine&#8211;phosphaalkene equilibrium, and that we can intentionally increase&#8230; our yields by simply elevating the temperature.&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at 10.1002/chem.202302535).







Abstract
Invited for the cover of this issue are the groups of M. Haas, G. Gescheidt and H. Gr&#252;tzmacher from the Graz University of Technology and the ETH Z&#252;rich. The image depicts a phosphorus mine, where the workers are acid chlorides using their shovels and red phosphorus to provide the chemicals necessary to produce novel reagents.

         <title>Living Self&#8208;Assembly of Metastable and Stable Two&#8208;Dimensional Platelets from a Single Small Molecule</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The living seeded self&#8208;assembly of metastable and stable 2D structures with uniform shapes and precise sizes can be achieved using an appropriate supersaturated level of a solution of 1 as the growth medium that can temporarily hold the almost&#8208;proceeding spontaneous nucleation. This new methodology allows the living self&#8208;assembly of small molecules to proceed in two independent steps, i.&#8201;e., the design of molecules for various crystalline structures as seeds and the application of a supersaturated solution with appropriate levels as the growth medium to grow the uniform structures with controlled sizes, thus rendering a convenient and adaptable methodology for novel architectures.







Abstract
This study reports the design of a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) molecule with two fluorene units on each side of a benzothiadiazole moiety, which allows multiple intermolecular interactions to compete with one another so as to induce the evolution of the metastable 2D platelets to the stable 2D platelets during the self&#8208;assembly of the D&#8208;A molecule. Importantly, the living seeded self&#8208;assembly of metastable and stable 2D structures with precisely controlled sizes can be conveniently achieved using an appropriate supersaturated level of a solution of the D&#8208;A molecule as the seeded growth medium that can temporarily hold the almost&#8208;proceeding spontaneous nucleation from competing with the seeded growth. The stable 2D platelets with smaller area sizes exhibit higher sensitivity to gaseous dimethyl sulfide, illustrating that the novel living self&#8208;assembly method provides more available functional structures with controlled sizes for practical applications. The key finding of this study is that the new living methodology is separated into two independent processes: the elaborate molecular design for various crystalline structures as seeds and the application of a supersaturated solution with appropriate levels as the growth medium to grow the uniform structures with controlled sizes; this would make convenient and possible the living seeded self&#8208;assembly of rich 1D, 2D, and 3D architectures.

         <title>Visible Light Mediated Co&#8208;Catalyzed Isocyanide Insertion with Sulfonyl Azide: Synthesis of Sulfonyl Carbamimidic Azide and Sulfonyl Aminotetrazole via Carbodiimide Intermediate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an efficient protocol to prepare sulfonyl carbamimidic azide and sulfonyl aminotetrazole via Co&#8208;catalyzed three component coupling of sulfonyl azide (acts as nitrene source), isocyanide, and TMS&#8208;azide at room temperature under visible light. The sulfonyl carbamimidic azide cyclizes in the presence of base to deliver N&#8208;sulfonyl aminotetrazole, which can also be synthesized directly without isolating the sulfonyl carbamimidic azide.







Abstract
Herein, we report an operationally simple and efficient protocol to prepare sulfonyl carbamimidic azide and N&#8208;sulfonyl aminotetrazole via Co&#8208;catalyzed three component coupling of sulfonyl azide (acts as nitrene source), isocyanide, and TMS&#8208;azide at room temperature under visible light. Initially, the carbamimidic azide is formed, which cyclizes only in the presence of base to deliver N&#8208;sulfonyl aminotetrazole in very good yields. The sulfonyl aminotetrazole can also be synthesized directly without isolating the carbamimidic azide in the presence of base. The sulfonyl azide is anticipated to generate nitrene and reacts with isocyanide to produce carbodiimide. Subsequent addition of azide (TMS&#8208;N3) to carbodiimide results in the formation of carbamimidic azide.

         <title>Interrelations between Linkage Isomers of an Efficient Square&#8208;planar Nickel(II) Nitrite Photoswitch in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient square&#8208;planar nitrite nickel(II) photoswitch is reported and used as a model case to study the nitro&#8208;to&#8208;nitrito isomerization mechanism in the solid state. Based on combined experimental and theoretical studies the nitro&#8594;exo&#8208;nitrito&#8594;endo&#8208;nitrito reaction pathway is proposed.







Abstract
An efficient nitrite nickel(II) photoswitch, with the 1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxyimino&#8208;3&#8208;[(2&#8217;&#8208;dimethylamino)ethyl]imino&#8208;1&#8208;propanone moiety used as the ancillary ligand, is reported. In the ground&#8208;state (&#8216;dark&#8217;) crystal structure, the studied compound exists predominantly as the nitro&#8208;(&#951;1&#8208;N(O)2) isomer, however, traces of the exo&#8208; and endo&#8208;nitrito&#8208;(&#951;1&#8208;ONO) forms are detected both at 100&#8197;K (4&#8211;5&#8201;% each) and under ambient conditions (~9&#8201;% each). When excited with the 405&#8211;530&#8197;nm LED light, the nitro&#8208;to&#8208;nitrito isomerization takes place. The total conversion exceeds 90&#8201;%. The exo&#8208;nitrito linkage isomer constitutes the dominant photo&#8208;generated form, whereas the relative population of both nitrito species depends on temperature. The reaction is fully reversible and reproducible. The photo&#8208;products are stable up to 200&#8197;K. The system constitutes a good model case for the reaction mechanism studies. Thus, experimental and theoretical investigations on the photo&#8208;isomerism were conducted and are presented in detail. Eventually, the nitro&#8594;exo&#8208;nitrito&#8594;endo&#8208;nitrito reaction pathway is proposed.

         <title>Capture&#8208;SELEX of DNA Aptamers for Sulforhodamine B and Fluorescein</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using the capture&#8208;SELEX method, a non&#8208;G&#8208;quadruplex DNA aptamer for sulforhodamine B (SRhB) was isolated with a Kd of 1&#8197;&#956;M. Aptamer binding induced fluorescence enhancement of SRhB. Using fluorescein as a target, the same method yielded an aptamer with a much lower affinity, suggesting that structural features of target molecules are critical for aptamer binding.







Abstract
While many dye binding aptamers have been reported, most of them were for light&#8208;up aptamers that can significantly enhance the quantum yield of fluorophores. Sulforhodamine B (SRhB) was used as a target previously to select both DNA and RNA aptamers, and the DNA aptamer was a G&#8208;quadruplex that can bind to a number of rhodamine analogs. In addition, the previous selections were performed by immobilizing the target molecules. In this work, the library immobilization method was used to respectively select aptamers for SRhB and fluorescein. The SRhB aptamer has a non&#8208;G&#8208;quadruplex structure with a Kd of 1.0&#8197;&#956;M measured from isothermal titration calorimetry. Upon titration of the aptamer, the fluorescence of SRhB increased 2.5&#8208;fold, and this aptamer does not require Mg2+ for binding. Rhodamine&#8197;B has even tighter binding suggesting binding through the xanthene moiety of the dyes. No binding was detected for fluorescein. For the fluorescein selection, a dominant aptamer sequence with a Kd of 147&#8197;&#956;M was obtained. This study provides two new aptamers for two important fluorophores that can be used to study aptamer&#8208;based separation, dye detection and catalysis. Comparison of these aptamers also provides insights into the effect of functional groups on aptamer binding.

         <title>Rational Design of a Multifunctional Benzothiadiazole Derivative in Organic Photonics and Electronics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A careful rational design of a multidonor benzothiadiazole derivative was carried out. This compound was synthesized employing microwave irradiation as energy source, that allows to increase the yields and reduce the reaction times. The desired compound showed multifunctional character with application in organic photonics as red optical waveguide and in organic electronics as p&#8208;type semiconductor in organic field&#8208;effect transistors.







Abstract
In order to achieve a multifunctional compound with potential application in organic photonics and electronics, a multidonor benzothiadiazole derivative was rationally designed and synthesized employing microwave irradiation as energy source, increasing the process efficiency about yields and reaction times in comparison with conventional conditions. This powerful compound displayed solvatochromism and showed efficient behavior as red optical waveguide with low OLC around 10&#8722;2&#8197;dB&#8201;&#956;m&#8722;1 and with the capacity of light transmission in two directions. In addition, the proposed derivative acted as efficient p&#8208;type semiconductor in organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) with hole mobilities up 10&#8722;1&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. This corroborates its multifunctional character, thus making it a potential candidate to be applied in hybrid organic field&#8208;effect optical waveguides (OFEWs).

         <dc:description>Catalytic activities of Mn(I) complexes derived from expensive MnBr(CO)5 salt have been explored in various dehydrogenative transformations. However, the reactivity and selectivity of inexpensive high spin Mn(II) complexes are uncommon. Herein, we have synthesized four new Mn(II) complexes and explored switchable alkenylation and alkylation of methyl heteroarenes employing a single Mn(II)catalyst. The developed protocol selectively furnishes a series of functionalized E&#8208;heteroarenes and C&#8208;alkylated heteroarenes with good to excellent yields. Various medicinally and synthetically useful compounds are successfully synthesized using our developed protocol. Various controls and kinetics experiments were executed to shed light on the mechaism,which reveals that &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;H bond breaking of alcohol is the slowest step.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrathin Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanosheets for Selective Photocatalytic C2H2 Semihydrogenation in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective semihydrogenation of C2H2 to C2H4 in crude C2H4 (with ~1 vol% C2H2 contamination) is a crucial process in the manufacture of polyethylene. Comparing to conventional thermalcatalytic route with Pd as catalytic under high temperature with H2 as hydrogen source, photocatalytic C2H2 reduction reaction with H2O as hydrogen source can achieve high selectivity under milder conditions, but has rarely been reported. Here, we present a kind of ultrathin metal&#8208;organic framework nanosheets (Cu&#8208;Co&#8208;MNSs) that demonstrate excellent catalytic activities in the semihydrogenation of C2H2. Employing Ru(bpy)32+ as the photosensitizer, this catalyst attains a noteworthy turnover number (TON) of 2124 for C2H4, coupled with an impressive selectivity of 99.5% after a 12 h visible light irradiation. This performance is comparable to molecular catalysts and notably surpasses the efficiency of bulk metal&#8208;organic framework materials. Furthermore, Cu&#8208;Co&#8208;MNSs achieve a 99.95% conversion of C2H2 under industrial relevant conditions (1.10% C2H2 in C2H4) with 90.3% selectivity for C2H4 over C2H6, demonstrating a great potential for polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 production.</dc:description>

         <title>Preparation of a Compound With Si(II)&#8211;Si(IV)&#8211;Si(II) Bonding Arrangement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis of a rare bis&#8208;silylene 1 in which two silylene atoms are bridged by a Si(IV) atom.&#160; Compound 1 contains an unusual Si(II)&#8208;Si(IV)&#8208;Si(II) bonding arrangement with the Si(II)&#8208;Si(IV) bond distances of 2.4212(8) and 2.4157(7) &#197;. Treatment of 1 with Fe(CO)5 afforded a dinuclear Fe(0) complex 2 with two unusually long Si&#8211;Si bonds (2.4515(8) and 2.4488(10) &#197;). We have also carried out a detailed computational study to understand the nature of the Si&#8211;Si bonds in these compounds. The NBO (Natural bond orbital) and EDA&#8208;NOCV (energy decomposition analysis&#8208;Natural orbital for chemical valence) analyses reveal that the Si&#8208;Si bonds in 1&#8208;2 are of electron&#8208;sharing nature.</dc:description>

The unprecedented reductive&#8208;thermal rearrangements of cyclic alkyl(amino) carbene (cAAC)&#8208;supported chloro&#8208;phosphinidenes afforded two novel ligands, the (aryl)&#8208;(imino) phosphides and the (aryl)&#8208;(phosphaalkene) amide, in the form of their corresponding alkali metal complexes. The former ligand was successfully used for the stabilization and first solid&#8208;state isolation of three cyclic alkyl(amino&#8208;boryl) phosphaalkenes, and two clusters with CuI4 and AgI8 cores.

Chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal racemization has been unraveled for MoO2(acnac)2 by using density functional theory. Nine energy minima, 13 transition structures, and all intrinsic reaction coordinates were identified. The kudu's antlers show the three sets enantiomers for cis&#8208;MoO2(acnac)2. Each antler reflects their chiral isomerization by DML twists. The horizontal lines connecting the antlers reflect chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal racemization for each enantiomer by CH twists.

         <title>On the Number of &#960;&#8208;Electrons Involved in Stepwise Cycloaddition Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
All these electrons. Many recently disclosed higher&#8208;order cycloadditions utilize cycloaddends which are benzofused. Are the &#960;&#8208;electrons of the appended aromatic ring acting as &#8220;spectator electrons&#8221; in higher&#8208;order cycloadditions, or do they exert an influence on the reaction?







Abstract
The development of higher&#8208;order cycloadditions has mainly been restricted by the requisite usage of highly conjugated and reactive &#960;&#8208;systems. Recent years have witnessed organocatalysis as a potent mediator for several of the challenges associated herein, rendering higher&#8208;order cycloadditions a legitimate option for achieving the selective construction of specific molecular scaffolds. These developments reinvigorate the efforts to try to understand the underlying principles for cycloadditions involving a higher number of &#960;&#8208;electrons than the &#8220;classical&#8221; cycloadditions; how do we properly address the impact which the addition of further &#960;&#8208;electrons have on the reactivity of a system? Herein, computational investigations of two model higher&#8208;order cycloaddition systems have been performed to try to provide insights on changes in energetic barriers induced by the presence of benzofusions in a position which is unobstructive to the reactivity. With experimental substantiation as support, these studies might open up for a discussion on whether the &#960;&#8208;electrons of benzofused systems simply act as spectator electrons, or play a tangible role on the observed reactivity to an extent where a distinct nomenclature is meritable.

These developments reinvigorate the efforts to try to understand the underlying principles for cycloadditions involving a higher number of &#960;-electrons than the &#8220;classical&#8221; cycloadditions; how do we properly address the impact which the addition of further &#960;-electrons have on the reactivity of a system? Herein, computational investigations of two model higher-order cycloaddition systems have been performed to try to provide insights on changes in energetic barriers induced by the presence of benzofusions in a position which is unobstructive to the reactivity. With experimental substantiation as support, these studies might open up for a discussion on whether the &#960;-electrons of benzofused systems simply act as spectator electrons, or play a tangible role on the observed reactivity to an extent where a distinct nomenclature is meritable.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electron Paramagnetic Resonance, Electronic Ground State, and Electron Spin Relaxation of Seven Lanthanide Ions Bound to Lanmodulin and the Bioinspired Chelator, 3,4,3&#8208;LI(1,2&#8208;HOPO)</title>

         <dc:description>
EPR spectroscopy has never been applied to small&#8208;molecule or protein complexes of lanthanide(III) ions besides Gd3+. Here, the EPR properties of 7 lanthanide(III) ions with the protein, lanmodulin, and the small&#8208;molecule chelator, 3,4,3&#8208;LI(1,2&#8208;HOPO), are investigated. The study shows differences in spectrum and relaxation properties that are dependent on both metal ion and coordination and motivates wider investigation of the EPR of lanthanides.







Abstract
The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of lanthanide(III) ions besides Gd3+, bound to small&#8208;molecule and protein chelators, are uncharacterized. Here, the EPR properties of 7 lanthanide(III) ions bound to the natural lanthanide&#8208;binding protein, lanmodulin (LanM), and the synthetic small&#8208;molecule chelator, 3,4,3&#8208;LI(1,2&#8208;HOPO) (&#8220;HOPO&#8221;), were systematically investigated. Echo&#8208;detected pulsed EPR spectra reveal intense signals from ions for which the normal continuous&#8208;wave first&#8208;derivative spectra are negligibly different from zero. Spectra of Kramers lanthanide ions Ce3+, Nd3+, Sm3+, Er3+, and Yb3+, and non&#8208;Kramers Tb3+ and Tm3+, bound to LanM are more similar to the ions in dilute aqueous:ethanol solution than to those coordinated with HOPO. Lanmodulins from two bacteria, with distinct metal&#8208;binding sites, had similar spectra for Tb3+ but different spectra for Nd3+. Spin echo dephasing rates (1/Tm) are faster for lanthanides than for most transition metals and limited detection of echoes to temperatures below ~6 to 12&#8197;K. Dephasing rates were environment dependent and decreased in the order water:ethanol&gt;LanM&gt;HOPO, which is attributed to decreasing librational motion. These results demonstrate that the EPR spectra and relaxation times of lanthanide(III) ions are sensitive to coordination environment, motivating wider application of these methods for characterization of both small&#8208;molecule and biomolecule interactions with lanthanides.

         <title>Functionalization of Dodecaborates by Mild and Efficient Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Formation of B&#8722;C Bonds with Boronic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The toolbox is full of boronic acids for Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling. To connect them to the dodecaborate cluster, special tools are necessary: iodine as leaving group on the dodecaborate, DavePhos as special ligand, and solvents that differ for electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor boronic acids. With these tools, the coupling can be carried out successfully. More information can be found in the Research Article by D. Gabel and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302466).

         <title>Transformation of Highly Hydrophobic Triarylphosphines into Amphiphiles via Staudinger Reaction with Hydrophilic Trichlorophenyl Azide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward transformation of highly hydrophobic triarylphosphines into amphiphiles via the Staudinger reaction with a hydrophilic trichlorophenyl azide is reported. The obtained amphiphiles were remarkably water&#8208;soluble, enabling their spontaneous self&#8208;assembly into 2&#8197;nm&#8208;sized micelles composed of 4&#8211;5 molecules in water. An amphiphile having a large hydrophobic surface solubilized various hydrophobic organic dyes in water.







Abstract
Owing to its hydrophobic properties and reactivity, triarylphosphines (PAr3) are promising precursors for the development of new amphiphiles. However, an efficient and reliable synthetic method for amphiphiles based on highly hydrophobic PAr3 is still required. Herein, a straightforward transformation of highly hydrophobic PAr3 into amphiphiles via the Staudinger reaction is reported. By simply mixing PAr3 and a hydrophilic trichlorophenyl azide containing two hydrophilic chains, amphiphiles bearing a N=P bond (i.&#8201;e., an azaylide moiety) were quantitatively formed. The obtained azaylide&#8208;based amphiphiles were remarkably water&#8208;soluble, enabling their spontaneous self&#8208;assembly into 2&#8197;nm&#8208;sized micelles composed of 4&#8211;5 molecules in water with a low critical micelle concentration (up to 0.05&#8197;mM or less) due to the effective intermolecular interactions among the hydrophobic surfaces. Although the azaylide moiety is easily hydrolyzed in the presence of water, the azaylide in the amphiphiles displayed notable stability in water even at 60&#8197;h, which stems from the LUMO modulation induced by the presence of three electron&#8208;withdrawing chloro groups and two twisted alkoxycarbonyl groups, according to DFT calculations. An amphiphile having a large hydrophobic surface solubilized various hydrophobic organic dyes through efficient intermolecular interactions, resulting in the dyes exhibiting either monomer or excimer emissions in water.

         <title>Nitrene C&#8722;H Bond Insertion Approach to Carbazolones and Indolones, and a Reactivity Departure for 7&#8208;Membered Analogues
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2&#8208;Arylcyclohexane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones and 2&#8208;arylcyclopentane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones can be converted in a facile 2&#8208;step, 1&#8208;pot manner to 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;azidocycloalk&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ones. These azides can be smoothly cyclized to carbazolones and indolones with catalytic Rh2(O2CC7H15)4. Although 3&#8208;azido&#8208;2&#8208;phenylcyclohept&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;one could be readily prepared from 2&#8208;phenylcycloheptane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione, by contrast the Rh&#8208;catalyzed cyclization gave an azirine in preference to the indole. Mechanistic and DFT studies complement the synthetic work.







Abstract
A modular platform for facile access to 1,2,3,9&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;4H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;4&#8208;ones (H4&#8208;carbazolones) and 3,4&#8208;dihydrocyclopenta[b]indol&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;ones (H2&#8208;indolones) is described. The requisite 6&#8208; and 5&#8208;membered 2&#8208;arylcycloalkane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione precursors were readily obtained through a Cu&#8208;catalyzed arylation of 1,3&#8208;cyclohexanediones or by a ring expansion of aryl succinoin derivatives. Enolization of one carbonyl group in the diones, conversion to a leaving group, and subsequent azidation gave 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;azidocycloalk&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ones. This two&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot azidation is highly regioselective with unsymmetrically substituted 2&#8208;arylcyclohexane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones. The regioselectivity, which is important for access to single isomers of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted carbazolones, was analyzed mechanistically and computationally. Finally, a Rh&#8208;catalyzed nitrene/nitrenoid insertion into the ortho C&#8722;H bond of the aryl moiety gave the H4&#8208;carbazolones and H2&#8208;indolones. One carbazolone was elaborated to an intermediate reported in the total synthesis of N&#8208;decarbomethoxychanofruticosinate, (&#8722;)&#8208;aspidospermidine, (+)&#8208;kopsihainanine A. With 2&#8208;phenylcycloheptane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione, prepared from cyclohexanone and benzaldehyde, the azidation reaction was readily accomplished. However, the Rh&#8208;catalyzed reaction unexpectedly led to a labile but characterizable azirine rather than the indole derivative. Computations were performed to understand the differences in reactivities of the 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;azidocycloalk&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ones in comparison to the 7&#8208;membered analogue, and to support the structural assignment of the azirine.

Finally, a Rh-catalyzed nitrene/nitrenoid insertion into the &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt; C&#8722;H bond of the aryl moiety gave the H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-carbazolones and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-indolones. One carbazolone was elaborated to an intermediate reported in the total synthesis of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-decarbomethoxychanofruticosinate, (&#8722;)-aspidospermidine, (+)-kopsihainanine A. With 2-phenylcycloheptane-1,3-dione, prepared from cyclohexanone and benzaldehyde, the azidation reaction was readily accomplished. However, the Rh-catalyzed reaction unexpectedly led to a labile but characterizable azirine rather than the indole derivative. Computations were performed to understand the differences in reactivities of the 5- and 6-membered 2-aryl-3-azidocycloalk-2-en-1-ones in comparison to the 7-membered analogue, and to support the structural assignment of the azirine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reductive Coupling of a Diazoalkane Derivative Promoted by a Potassium Aluminyl and Elimination of Dinitrogen to Generate a Reactive Aluminium Ketimide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potassium aluminyl K[Al(NON)] reductively couples 9&#8208;diazo&#8208;9H&#8208;fluorene (fluN2) to generate a highly coloured species containing the [fluNNNNflu]2&#8722; ligand. Thermal elimination of N2 and loss of doubly reduced 1,2&#8208;di(9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;9&#8208;yl)diazene [fluN=Nflu]2&#8722; as the potassium salt generates a neutral aluminium ketimide, which undergoes cycloaddition and hydrogen transfer to form the corresponding guanidinate complex.







Abstract
The reaction of 9&#8208;diazo&#8208;9H&#8208;fluorene (fluN2) with the potassium aluminyl K[Al(NON)] ([NON]2&#8722;=[O(SiMe2NDipp)2]2&#8722;, Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) affords K[Al(NON)(&#954;N1,N3&#8208;{(fluN2)2})] (1). Structural analysis shows a near planar 1,4&#8208;di(9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;9&#8208;ylidene)tetraazadiide ligand that chelates to the aluminium. The thermally induced elimination of dinitrogen from 1 affords the neutral aluminium ketimide complex, Al(NON)(N=flu)(THF) (2) and the 1,2&#8208;di(9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;9&#8208;yl)diazene dianion as the potassium salt, [K2(THF)3][fluN=Nflu] (3). The reaction of 2 with N,N&#8217;&#8208;diisopropylcarbodiimide (iPrN=C=NiPr) affords the aluminium guanidinate complex, Al(NON){N(iPr)C(N=CMe2)N(CHflu)} (4), showing a rare example of reactivity at a metal ketimide ligand. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been used to examine the bonding in the newly formed [(fluN2)2]2&#8722; ligand in 1 and the ketimide bonding in 2. The mechanism leading to the formation of 4 has also been studied using this technique.

         <title>Halide&#8208;Coupled Double Electron Transfer with Electron&#8208;Rich Diboranes</title>

Bartering a halide for two electrons: We describe the first halide&#8208;coupled double electron transfer reactions between a diborane and an organic substrate, leading to diborylated dienamines.







Abstract
The ditriflato&#8208;diborane B2(&#956;&#8208;hpp)2(OTf)2 (hpp=1,3,4,6,7,8&#8208;hexahydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrimido[1,2&#8208;a]pyrimidinate) acts as a stable surrogate of the elusive dication [B2(hpp)2]2+, being both electrophilic (vacant boron p orbitals) and nucleophilic (filled B&#8722;B bond orbital). This combination of seemingly contrasting behaviors could be used to develop a metallomimetic diborane chemistry, with Lewis &#963;&#8208;basic and &#960;&#8208;acidic substrates being bound and reduced at the diborane. Here, we report on a novel reaction type within this general theme, in which double electron transfer from the diboron unit to the boron&#8211;bound organic substrate is coupled with halide transfer in the other direction. Novel diborylated dienamines are synthesized in this way. The scope of this unprecedented reaction motif and the reaction pathways are elucidated.

         <title>Transforming Hetera&#8208;Buckybowls into Chiral Conjugated Polycycles Incorporating Epoxycyclooctadiene: a Two&#8208;Step Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we present a novel approach to synthesize chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycycles incorporating the epoxycyclooctadiene moiety, a key fragment found in the natural products. Our synthetic strategy capitalizes on innovative reactions involving hetera&#8208;buckybowl triselenasumanene (TSS) and is achieved through a concise two&#8208;step process.







Abstract
Chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycycles have garnered increasing attention due to versatile applications in optoelectronic materials and biological sciences. In this study, we report the synthesis of chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycycles incorporating a chiral epoxycyclooctadiene moiety. Our synthetic strategy capitalizes on the novel reactions of hetera&#8208;buckybowl triselenasumanene (TSS) and is achieved in two&#8208;step manner. Firstly, the TSS is regio&#8208;selectively transformed into its ortho&#8208;quinone form. Subsequently, the nucleophilic addition reactions of TSS ortho&#8208;quinone by phenylethynides are metal ion&#8208;dependent. When utilizing (phenylethynyl)magnesium bromide as the nucleophile, two phenylethynyls are furnished onto the edged benzene ring of TSS. When the nucleophile is (phenylethynyl)lithium, a cascade of nucleophilic addition, intermolecular electron&#8208;transfer, ring&#8208;opening, and tetradehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder (TDDA) reactions occur sequentially in one&#8208;pot, ultimately affording chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycycles featuring the epoxycyclooctadiene moiety as an integral part of their backbones. This work represents a step forward in the synthesis of chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycycles using TSS as synthon.

         <title>Anion Tuned Structural Modulation and Nonlinear Optical Effects of Metal&#8208;Ion Directed 310&#8208;Helix Networks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The utility of short tripeptide 310&#8208;helices with terminal pyridyl groups was demonstrated in constructing diverse silver&#8208;coordinated networks. Further, the non&#8208;linear optical effects of these silver coordinated peptide networks was studied.







Abstract
Metals play an important role in the structure and functions of various proteins. The combination of metal ions and peptides have been emerging as an attractive field to create advanced structures and biomaterials. Here, we are reporting the anion&#8208;influenced, silver ion coordinated diverse networks of designed short tripeptide 310&#8208;helices with terminal pyridyl groups. The short peptides adopted classical right&#8208;handed, left&#8208;handed and 310EL&#8208;helical conformations in the presence of different silver salts. The peptides have displayed conformational flexibility to accommodate different sizes and interactions of anions to yield a variety of metal&#8208;coordinated networks. The complexes of metal ions and peptides have shown different porous networks, right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed helical polymers, transformation of helix into superhelix and 2&#8201;:&#8201;2 metal&#8208;peptide macrocycles. Further, the metal&#8208;peptide crystals with inherent dipoles of helical peptides gave striking second harmonic generation response. The optical energy upconversion from NIR to red and green light is demonstrated. Overall, we have shown the utilization of short 310&#8208;helices for the construction of diverse metal&#8208;coordinated helical networks and notable non&#8208;linear optical effects.

         <title>J&#8208;Aggregate&#8208;Triggering BODIPYs: an Ultrasensitive Chromogenic and Fluorogenic Sensing Platform for Perfluorooctanesulfonate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are chemicals that bioaccumulate and resist degradation, posing serious threats to health and the environment. Current analytical methods are ill&#8208;suited for the rapid visual detection of point sources of contamination in the field. Here, a simple, rapid, and highly sensitive chromogenic and fluorogenic &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; sensor is reported that can detect and remove PFASs from contaminated water with high efficiency.







Abstract
Contamination of water supplies by polyfluoroalkyl substances, notably perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), has serious health and environmental consequences. Therefore, the development of straightforward and effective means of monitoring and removing PFASs is urgently required. In this study, we report a rapid and sensitive method for the detection of PFOS and PFOA in water that rely on the J&#8208;aggregate formation of meso&#8208;ester&#8208;BODIPY dyes. The dye C10&#8208;mim, which contains a hydrophilic methylimidazolium group and a hydrophobic alkylated BODIPY, self&#8208;assembles in water into weakly green&#8208;emissive micellar assemblies. Upon binding to PFOS or PFOA, a spontaneous disassembly and reorganization forms orange&#8208;emissive J&#8208;aggregates. The rapid formation (&#8804;5&#8197;s) of J&#8208;aggregates and the accompanying spectral shifts provide a superior sensing performance, with excellent sensitivity (limit of detection=0.18&#8197;ppb for PFOS) and distinct chromogenic and fluorogenic &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; responses.

         <dc:description>Magnetic refrigeration technology based on Gd&#8208;based paramagnets is expected to be applied to refrigeration in extremely low temperatures, thereby reducing the consumption of liquid helium. Here, we obtained a compound, Gd3TeBO9 with high Gd3+ concentration through element substitution. The Gd3+ concentration in this compound is as high as 2.4&#215;1024 ions/kg, which is 33% higher than the commercial Gd3Ga5O12 (GGG), and further magnetic tests show that Gd3TeBO9 has a large magnetic entropy change (57.44 J/(kg K) and 408 mJ/(cm3 K) at 2.6 K and 7 T), which is 1.5 times that of GGG, implying the possibility of its further development as an potential magnetocaloric material.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the Multifarious Role of the Ligand in Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Pathways</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent years have seen an emerging interest in the scientific world to exploring the multifaceted properties of redox&#8208;active ligands towards the design and synthesis of robust and efficient molecular electrocatalysts exhibiting HER. This Review highlights the role of metal&#8211;ligand cooperativity on mechanistic pathways utilizing 3d transition metal&#8208;based complexes.







Abstract
In recent years, researchers have shifted their focus towards investigating the redox properties of ancillary ligand backbones for small&#8208;molecule activation. Several metal complexes have been reported for the electrocatalytic H2 evolution reaction (HER), providing valuable mechanistic insights. This process involves efficient coupling of electrons and protons. Redox&#8208;active ligands stipulate internal electron transfer and promote effective orbital overlap between metal and ligand, thereby, enabling efficient proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer reactions. Understanding such catalytic mechanisms requires thorough spectroscopic and computational analyses. Herein, we summarize recent examples of molecular electrocatalysts based on 3d transition metals that have significantly influenced mechanistic pathways, thus, emphasizing the multifaceted role of metal&#8211;ligand cooperativity.

         <title>HER&#8208;2&#8208;Targeted Boron Neutron Capture Therapy with Carborane&#8208;integrated Immunoliposomes Prepared via an Exchanging Reaction</title>

Carborane integrated immunoliposome was prepared by host exchanging reaction as a boron agent for BNCT.







Abstract
Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is a promising modality for cancer treatment because of its minimal invasiveness. To maximize the therapeutic benefits of BNCT, the development of efficient platforms for the delivery of boron agents is indispensable. Here, carborane&#8208;integrated immunoliposomes were prepared via an exchanging reaction to achieve HER&#8208;2&#8208;targeted BNCT. The conjugation of an anti&#8208;HER&#8208;2 antibody to carborane&#8208;integrated liposomes successfully endowed these liposomes with targeting properties toward HER&#8208;2&#8208;overexpressing human ovarian cancer cells (SK&#8208;OV3); the resulting BNCT activity toward SK&#8208;OV3 cells obtained using the current immunoliposomal system was 14&#8208;fold that of the l&#8208;BPA/fructose complex, which is a clinically available boron agent. Moreover, the growth of spheroids treated with this system followed by thermal neutron irradiation was significantly suppressed compared with treatment with the l&#8208;BPA/fructose complex.

         <title>Differentiating between Label and Protein Conformers in Pulsed Dipolar EPR Spectroscopy with the dHis&#8208;Cu2+(NTA) Motif</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Keeping on the straight and narrow: The dHis&#8208;Cu2+(NTA) motif does not require a histidine&#8208;null background construct and enables label and protein conformers to be differentiated in pulsed dipolar EPR experiments. Here, we show that &#945;&#8208;helix 14 of YopO adopts only a straight conformation in the absence of actin.







Abstract
Pulsed dipolar EPR spectroscopy (PDS) in combination with site&#8208;directed spin labeling is a powerful tool in structural biology. However, the commonly used spin labels are conjugated to biomolecules via rather long and flexible linkers, which hampers the translation of distance distributions into biomolecular conformations. In contrast, the spin label copper(II)&#8208;nitrilotriacetic acid [Cu2+(NTA)] bound to two histidines (dHis) is rigid and yields narrow distance distributions, which can be more easily translated into biomolecular conformations. Here, we use this label on the 71&#8197;kDa Yersinia outer protein O (YopO) to decipher whether a previously experimentally observed bimodal distance distribution is due to two conformations of the biomolecule or of the flexible spin labels. Two different PDS experiments, that is, pulsed electron&#8211;electron double resonance (PELDOR aka DEER) and relaxation&#8208;induced dipolar modulation enhancement (RIDME), yield unimodal distance distribution with the dHis&#8208;Cu2+(NTA) motif; this result suggests that the &#945;&#8208;helical backbone of YopO adopts a single conformation in frozen solution. In addition, we show that the Cu2+(NTA) label preferentially binds to the target double histidine (dHis) sites even in the presence of 22 competing native histidine residues. Our results therefore suggest that the generation of a His&#8208;null background is not required for this spin labeling methodology. Together these results highlight the value of the dHis&#8208;Cu2+(NTA) motif in PDS experiments.

         <title>Synthetic Strategies of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Olefin (NHOs) and Their Recent Application of Organocatalytic Reactions and Beyond</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (NHO) properties, synthetic methods, and applications are the main topics of this review work. In contrast to the NHC catalyst, NHOs, a recently identified class of electron&#8208;rich, polar alkene, exhibit important characteristics including strong basicity, high nucleophilicity, and high donating tendency. In addition, we comprehend their chemical reactivity and selectivity, and summarised the majority of organic synthesis processes, such as asymmetric catalysis, hydroborylation, hydrosilylation, reduction, CO2 sequestration, polymerisation, alkylation, etc.







Abstract
N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin (NHO) derivatives have an electron&#8208;rich as well as highly polarized carabon&#8208;carbon (C=C) double bond because of the electron&#8208;donating nature of nitrogen and sulphur atoms. While NHOs have been developing as novel organocatalysts and ligands for transition&#8208;metal complexes in various organic compound syntheses, different research groups are currently interested in preparing imidazole and triazolium&#8208;based chiral NHO catalysts. Some of them have been used for enantioselective organic transformations, but were still elusive. N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins, the alkylidene derivatives of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHC), have shown promising results as effective promoters for numerous organic syntheses such as asymmetric catalysis, hydroborylation, hydrosilylation, reduction, CO2 sequestration, alkylation, cycloaddition, polymerization and the ring&#8208;opening reaction of aziridine and epoxides, esterification, C&#8722;F bond functionalization, amine coupling, trifluoromethyl thiolation, amination etc. NHOs catalysts with suitable structures can serve as a novel class of Lewis/Bronsted bases with strong basicity and high nucleophilicity properties.These facts strongly suggest their enormous chemical potential as sustainable catalysts for a wide variety of reactions in synthetic chemistry. The synthesis of NHOs and their properties are briefly reviewed in this article, along with a summary of the imidazole and triazole core of NHOs&#8242; most recent catalytic uses.

         <title>Charge Transfer in Be&#8722;Ru Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Be7Ru4 and Be12Ru7 are novel structural prototypes featuring an inhomogeneous 2D intergrowth of Fe2P&#8208; and U3Si2&#8208;type motifs. Chemical bonding analysis reveals the presence of polar multi&#8208;atomic bonds and charge transfer. Topological analysis of electron density in the Be&#8722;Ru compounds demonstrates non&#8208;linear change in the atomic volumina and complex variation of QTAIM atomic charges with composition.







Abstract
During the investigation of the binary system Be&#8722;Ru two new phases &#8211; Be7Ru4 and Be12Ru7 &#8211; with similar compositions (63.6 at. % Be and 63.2 at. % Be, respectively), are discovered. They both represent new structural prototypes. The phases are located between Be2Ru (Fe2P&#8208;type structure) and Be3Ru2 (U3Si2&#8208;type structure) in the phase diagram. This explains why their crystal structures, solved and refined from single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data, are described as 2D intergrowth of Fe2P and U3Si2 motives. The calculated electronic density of stats (DOS) reveals pronounced minima in the vicinity of the Fermi level for both compounds. Position&#8208;space analysis of chemical bonding exhibits the formation of three&#8208; and four&#8208;atomic polar bonds, involving both, Ru and Be, atoms, and a strong charge transfer from Be to the more electronegative Ru.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Boron&#8208;Containing Heteromerous Bistricyclic Aromatic Enes: Structural Effects on Thermodynamic Stability and Photoreactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Overcrowded bistricyclic aromatic enes (BAEs) are compounds that exhibit various conformational isomers. In this study, heteromerous BAEs were synthesized by incorporating different tricyclic structures into a homomerous boron&#8208;containing BAE. The thermodynamic stability of the heteromerous BAEs could be modulated by the flexibility of the introduced structures. Additionally, photoreactivity was observed, resulting in the preparation of compounds with helicity.







Abstract
Overcrowded bistricyclic aromatic enes (BAEs) have several conformations such as twisted and anti&#8208;folded conformers, and their stereochemistry and chromism have been studied in earnest. In this study, boron&#8208;containing heteromerous BAEs having various tricyclic structures were synthesized and their photophysical properties investigated. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis revealed that the introduction of a rigid fluorene unit resulted in a twisted conformer, whereas the introduction of flexible units such as thioxanthene and 9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroanthracene units resulted in an anti&#8208;folded conformer. The absorption spectra of the heteromerous BAEs were dependent on the introduced tricyclic structures, suggesting the immense impact of the tricyclic structures on the electronic structures of BAEs. DFT calculations revealed the large effect of the flexibility of the tricyclic structures on the thermodynamic stability of the conformers. In addition, the boron&#8208;containing heteromerous BAEs underwent photocyclization reactions, indicating their potential application as precursors of polyaromatic hydrocarbons and helical aromatic materials.

         <title>Direct Spectroscopic Identification of BN&#8208;Arynes and Subtle Steric Effects on Nitrogen Fixation
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unstable 9&#8208;azido&#8208;9&#8208;borafluorene is successfully studied via matrix isolation, employing its pyridine adduct as a precursor for sublimation. A photoinduced isomerization process leads to the formation of the unique Lewis acid&#8208;base adduct between the BN&#8208;aryne and dinitrogen. Introduction of tert&#8208;Bu groups on the other hand reduces reactivity, effectively preventing N2 fixation.







Abstract
1,2&#8208;Azaborinines are the BN analogues of arynes through exchange of the formal CC triple bond by an isoelectronic BN bond. The BN&#8208;arynes are an underexplored class of reactive intermediates. Dibenzo[c,e][1,2]azaborinine (10,9&#8208;BN&#8208;phenanthryne) 1 was inferred as reactive intermediate by trapping reactions. Here it is shown that 1 can be generated in the gas phase by thermolysis from the pyridine adduct of 9&#8208;azido&#8208;9&#8208;borafluorene by cleavage of the dative bond with pyridine and dinitrogen extrusion. The ionization potential of 1 is 8.2&#8197;eV with ionization resulting from the &#960; HOMO. Under cryogenic matrix isolation conditions, 9&#8208;azido&#8208;9&#8208;borafluorene photolysis results in isomerization to the dinitrogen adduct of 1 without involvement of a triplet borylnitrene intermediate. Photochemical nitrogen extrusion from 1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;N2 is not possible and nitrogen fixation is irreversible under cryogenic conditions. In contrast, 2,4,7,9&#8208;tetra&#8208;tert&#8208;butyldibenzo[c,e][1,2]azaborinine can be photogenerated from the corresponding azidoborole precursor under cryogenic matrix isolation conditions, and nitrogen fixation is precluded due to steric hindrance. The BN stretching vibration at about 1750&#8197;cm&#8722;1 is much weaker than in typical linear diaryl iminoboranes.

         <title>Molecules that Turn Themselves Inside&#8208;Out: Tuning in/out Equilibria and Homeomorphic Isomerization in Macrobicyclic Dibridgehead Diphosphines P((CH2)n)3P Newly Accessible by Earth&#8208;Abundant&#8208;Metal Templates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It&#8242;s not sorcery. Certain molecules can turn themselves inside out, akin to many articles of clothing, thus displaying two distinct external surfaces. Rates and equilibria for the title diphosphines, as well as greatly improved syntheses, are described. This provides the first in&#8208;depth mapping of such phenomena as a function of ring size for any series of aliphatic macrobicyclic compounds XE((CH2)n)3EX.







Abstract
Photolyses of trans&#8208;Fe(CO)3(P((CH2)n)3P) (n=10 (a), 12 (b), 14 (c), 16 (d), 18 (e)) in the presence of PMe3 provide the first economical and scalable route to macrobicyclic dibridgehead diphosphines P((CH2)n)3P (1). These are isolated as mixtures of in,in/out,out isomers that equilibrate with degenerate in,out/out,in isomers at 150&#8201;&#176;C via pyramidal inversion at phosphorus. For the entire series, VT 31P NMR data establish or bound Keq, rates, and activation parameters for a variety of phenomena, many of which involve homeomorphic isomerizations, topological processes by which certain molecules can turn themselves inside out (e.&#8201;g., in,in&#8652;out,out). This provides the first detailed mapping of such trends in homologous series of aliphatic bicyclic compounds XE((CH2)n)3EX with any type of bridgehead. Isomeric diborane adducts 1&#8201;a,d&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2BH3 are also characterized.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It&#8242;s not sorcery&lt;/b&gt;. Certain molecules can turn themselves inside out, akin to many articles of clothing, thus displaying two distinct external surfaces. Rates and equilibria for the title diphosphines, as well as greatly improved syntheses, are described. This provides the first in-depth mapping of such phenomena as a function of ring size for any series of aliphatic macrobicyclic compounds XE((CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;

         <title>Harnessing the Peterson Reaction for the Stereospecific Synthesis of Z&#8208;Vinyl Ethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near exclusive formation of a Z vinyl ether: A variant of the Peterson reaction generates Z vinyl ethers of the type RCH=CHOR&#8217; with very high stereoselectivity, a functionality found in natural plasmalogens. (R,R)/(S,S)&#8208;1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxyalkylsilanes, obtained from terminal alkynes, via 2&#8208;trimethylsilyl&#8208;3&#8208;substituted epoxides by regioselective, BF3&#8208;catalysed epoxide ring opening with an alcohol, were treated with KH in &#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;trifluorotoluene to give Z vinyl ethers (Z/E ratio: 99&#8201;:&#8201;1).







Abstract
Vinyl ethers are valuable synthetic intermediates which are also found as natural products, including aflatoxins, rifamycins and plasmalogens. The latter are ubiquitous phospholipids in human cells and contain a vinyl ether moiety with specifically Z configuration. Although numerous methods are available for synthesis of vinyl ethers, there is a lack of methods for obtaining Z isomers of molecules of the type RCH=CHOR&#8217; that are applicable to plasmalogens. A variant of the Peterson reaction is described that generates such molecules with very high stereoselectivity (Z/E ratio: 99&#8201;:&#8201;1). (R,R)/(S,S)&#8208;1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxyalkylsilanes were synthesized from 1&#8208;trimethylsilylalkynes by a sequence of reduction with di&#8208;isobutylaluminium hydride to a (Z)&#8208;1&#8208;trimethylsilylalkene, epoxidation of the alkene to a 2&#8208;trimethylsilyl&#8208;3&#8208;substituted epoxide and regioselective, boron&#8208;trifluoride catalyzed ring&#8208;opening of the epoxide by reaction with an alcohol. Conversion of the (R,R)/(S,S)&#8208;1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxyalkylsilanes to vinyl ethers (RCH=CHOR&#8217;) was achieved under basic conditions as in a standard Peterson reaction. However, near exclusive formation of a Z vinyl ether was only achieved when the reaction was performed using potassium hydride in the non&#8208;polar solvent &#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;trifluorotoluene, more polar solvents giving increasing amounts of the E isomer. The sequence described embraces a variety of substituents and precursors, proceeds in overall high yield and is readily scalable.

         <title>A Methoxylation&#8208;Promoted CPET Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A methoxylation reaction at the ligand backbone promoting a CPET reaction oxidizing central metal ion has been disclosed. Notably, the demethoxylation induced reduction has also been realized. Hither&#8208;to&#8208;unknown such reactions have been achieved on a cobalt(II) high spin complex containing a redox non&#8208;innocent 1,4&#8208;naphthoquinone derivative.







Abstract
The manuscript discloses a methoxylation reaction to an aromatic carbonyl function that carries out a CPET reaction oxidizing a transition metal ion. Spontaneous methoxylation of a redox non&#8208;innocent fragment coordinated to a high spin cobalt(II) ion, promoted concerted proton electron transfer (CPET) reaction oxidizing cobalt(II) to cobalt(III) in air and subsequent demethoxylation induced reduction of cobalt(III) to cobalt(II) producing H2O2 are authenticated. The cobalt(III)/cobalt(II) electron transfer (ET) potential of the designed complex in CH2Cl2 is &#8722;0.27&#8197;V vs Fc+/Fc redox couple. However, in presence of MeOH the reduction potential decreases to &#8722;1.02&#8197;V due to CPET involving MeOH proton. In CH2Cl2/CHCl3 spontaneous demethoxylation occurs giving back the original complex and reactive methoxyl radical that reacts with O2 producing H2O2. Overall one molecule of MeOH produces one molecule of H2O2. To analyze the involvement of the proton, the rate constants of the CPET reactions in CH2Cl2&#8208;MeOH (2&#8201;:&#8201;1) and CH2Cl2&#8208;CD3OD (2&#8201;:&#8201;1) and the demethoxylation reaction in CHCl3 at 330&#8197;K were determined by time drive UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy.

         <title>A Prato Tour on Carbon Nanotubes: Raman Insights</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The functionalisation of carbon nanotubes using Prato reaction and diazonium&#8208;based radical addition has been studied. The results support the idea that data obtained by Raman spectroscopy are only helpful for comparing functionalisations produced using the same type of reaction. However, they should be carefully analysed when comparing different reaction types.







Abstract
The functionalisation of carbon nanotubes has been instrumental in broadening its application field, allowing especially its use in biological studies. Although numerous covalent and non&#8208;covalent functionalisation methods have been described, the characterisation of the final materials has always been an added challenge. Among the various techniques available, Raman spectroscopy is one of the most widely used to determine the covalent functionalisation of these species. However, Raman spectroscopy is not a quantitative technique, and no studies are reported comparing its performance when the same number of functional groups are added but using completely different reactions. In this work, we have experimentally and theoretically studied the functionalisation of carbon nanotubes using two of the most commonly used reactions: 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of azomethylene ylides and diazonium&#8208;based radical addition. The number of groups introduced onto the tubes by these reactions has been determined by different characterisation techniques. The results of this study support the idea that data obtained by Raman spectra are only helpful for comparing functionalisations produced using the same type of reaction. However, they should be carefully analysed when comparing functionalisations produced using different reaction types.

         <title>A Multi&#8208;Pyridine&#8208;Anchored and &#8208;Linked Bilayer Photocathode for Water Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NiO Substrate &amp; Co. A photocathode has been prepared by using a pyrene&#8208;based photosensitizer with multiple terminal pyridine moieties as both the anchoring and linking groups to connect a Co hydrogen&#8208;evolution catalyst to the NiO substrate. This photocathode exhibits good dye adsorption and photochemical stability in aqueous solution and is applied in water reduction into hydrogen under irradiation in photo&#8208;electrochemical cells.







Abstract
The development of efficient photocathodes is of critical importance for the constructions of promising tandem photo&#8208;electrochemical cells. Most known dye&#8208;sensitized photocathodes are prepared with the conventional carboxylic or phosphonic acid anchors and require the presence of other terminal linking groups to connect catalysts; they suffer from high synthetic difficulty and low adsorption stability in aqueous media. Here, a compact bilayer photocathode has been prepared by using a pyrene&#8208;based photosensitizer with multiple terminal pyridine moieties as both the anchoring and linking groups to connect a Co hydrogen&#8208;evolution catalyst to the NiO substrate. The catalyst and dye molecule are assembled in a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer manner on NiO through the metal&#8208;pyridine coordination. This photocathode exhibits good dye adsorption stability in aqueous media. A stable cathodic photocurrent of 70&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was achieved, with H2 being generated at the photocathode under the visible&#8208;light irradiation. The Faraday efficiency of H2 evolution was estimated to be 9.1&#8201;%. Transient absorption spectral studies suggest that the interfacial hole transfer occurs within a few picoseconds. The integration of the organic photosensitizer with pyridine anchoring and linking groups is expected to provide a simple method for the fabrication of stable and efficient photocathodes.

         <title>Recent Developments of Dual Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Nitrogen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent years, DSACs for ENRR have been developed rapidly. We give essential characterization and detection methods after reviewing DSACs&#8242; coordination environments, support materials, the N2 molecule, and NRR mechanism configuration. Finally, we suggested electrochemical NRR research issues, answers, and future directions.







Abstract
Ammonia is vital for fertilizer production, hydrogen storage, and alternative fuels. The conventional Haber&#8208;Bosch process for ammonia production is energy&#8208;intensive and environmentally harmful. Designing environmentally friendly and low&#8208;energy consumption strategies for electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (ENRR) in mild conditions is meaningful. Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have been studied extensively for NRR due to their high atomic utilization and unique electronic structure but are limited by their poor faradic efficiency and low ammonia formation yield. Dual single&#8208;atom catalysts (DSACs) have recently emerged as a promising solution for the effective activation of molecular N2, providing diverse active sites and synergistic interactions between adjacent atoms. In this review, we summarize the latest advances in metal DSACs for electrochemical ENRR based on both theoretical calculations and experimental studies, including aspects such as their variety, coordination, support, N2 adsorption and activity mechanisms, the characterization of NRR and electrochemical cell Configuration. We also address challenges and prospects in this rapidly evolving field, providing a comprehensive overview of DSACs for ENRR.

         <title>Bioinspired Functionalization of Carbonyl Compounds Enabled by Metal Chelated Bifunctional Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The current Review gives an overview of the recently developed synthetic transformations enabled by Nature&#8208;inspired bifunctional ligands that not only bind to a metal catalyst but also activate the carbonyl substrates, for example aldehydes, ketones etc., via organocatalysis, thereby accelerating the rate and facilitating stereoselectivity of the new chemical bond forming step.







Abstract
In Nature, enzymatic reactions proceed through exceptionally ordered transition states giving rise to extraordinary levels of stereoselection. In those reactions, the active site of the enzyme plays crucial roles &#8211; through one position, it holds the substrate in the proximity to the reaction epicentre that facilitates both the reactivity and stereoselectivity of the chemical process. Inspired by this natural phenomenon, synthetic chemists have designed bifunctional ligands that not only coordinate to a metal centre but also preassociate with an organic substrate, for example aldehyde and ketone, and exerts stereodirecting influence to accelerate the attack of the incoming reacting partner from a particular enantiotopic face. The chief goal of the current review is to give an overview of the recently developed approaches enabled by privileged bio&#8208;inspired bifunctional ligands that not only bind to the metal catalyst but also activates carbonyl substrates via organocatalysis, thereby easing in the new bond forming step. As carbonyl &#945;&#8208;functionalizations are dominated by enamine and enolate chemistry, the current review primarily focusses on enamine&#8208; and enolate&#8208;metal catalysis by bifunctional ligands. Thus, developments based on traditional cooperative catalysis occurring through two directly coupled but independent catalytic cycles of an organocatalyst and a metal catalyst are not covered.

         <title>Synthesis and Photochromic Properties of Diaryl [5]Helicene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diaryl [5]helicene derivatives demonstrate well&#8208;defined reversible photocyclization reactions with turn&#8208;off mode fluorescent photoswitching behaviors upon photochromic reaction. The loss of aromaticity of the central benzene ring of [5]helicene along with the photocyclization reaction the thermal bleaching rate.







Abstract
Photoinduced tuning of aromaticity and correlative molecular properties has attracted enormous interest in recent years both for modulating photochromism properties and designing novel photochromic materials. Here, we report the synthesis and photochemical characterization of diaryl[5]helicene&#8208;based diarylethene molecular switches. 3,4&#8208;Bis(2,4&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;5&#8208;phenylthiophen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)dibenzo[c,g]phenanthrene derivative 1&#8201;a showed no photochromic reaction, whereas 3,4&#8208;bis(2&#8208;methyl&#8208;5&#8208;phenylthiophen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)dibenzo[c,g]phenanthrene derivative 2&#8201;a and 3,4&#8208;bis(5&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;phenylthiazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl)dibenzo[c,g]phenanthrene derivative 3&#8201;a exhibited reversible photochromism in different aprotic solvents with specific light irradiation. Meanwhile, the diarylethene compounds 2&#8201;a and 3&#8201;a underwent turn&#8208;off mode fluorescence photoswitching together with photoisomerization upon light irradiation. Remarkably, the photoinduced changes in the aromaticity of [5]helicene as a central ethene bridge along with the relative smaller activation energy and higher frequency factor facilitated the thermal bleaching rates of diarylethene switches 2 and 3 in solution. This research provides new insight for designing aromatic diarylethene photoswitches for reversible fluorescence switching, photoinduced changes in aromaticity and further fast thermal back reactions.

         <title>Diversification of the Carbodicarbene Class by Embedding an Anionic Component in its Scaffold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the synthesis of anionic CDC pincer Pd complexes containing BF2 moiety, which exhibits facile second coordination toward Au(I), Ag(I) and Pd(II) without any external ligand assistance. Such phenomenon of gem&#8208;bimetallic supported by anionic pincer CDC is unprecedented, as pincer neutral CDC complexes are failed to exhibit two&#8208;fold donor capacity.







Abstract
Carbodicarbene (CDC) has become an emerging ligand in many fields due to its strong &#963;&#8208;donating ability. &lt;We report the first synthesis of the anionic CDC Pd complexes containing a BF2&#8208; moiety within the framework to leverage the electronic feature of carbon carbone. The elucidation of X&#8208;ray crystal structures, ligand competition as well as transmetallation experiments suggest that the anionic moiety has enhanced the overall donor strength of the traditional neutral CDC. Importantly, this anionic scaffold exhibits a facile second coordination toward Au(I), Ag(I) and Pd(II) without any external ligand assistance, whereas previously reported neutral pincer CDC complexes do not possess a two&#8208;fold donor capacity. The analysis of the bonding situation via theoretical methods shows that the description of the anionic CDC moieties in terms of dative bonding is preferred over the model of delocalized positive charge, as it accounts for the two&#8208;fold donor ability of the divalent carbon atom, preserving a characteristic feature of a carbone.

         <title>Extended Tetrathiafulvalenes with Fluoreno[3,2&#8208;b]fluorene and Diindeno[1,2&#8208;b:1',2'&#8208;i]anthracene Cores</title>

         <dc:description>In one&#8208;dimensional polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) containing five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered rings fused together, one key question is whether the structures possess a quinoidal or aromatic diradical character. Here, we generate such PAHs by reversible oxidation of PAH&#8208;extended tetrathiafulvalenes (TTFs). Extended TTFs were thus prepared and studied for their geometrical properties (crystallography), redox properties, and UV/Vis/NIR/EPR characteristics as a function of charge state. The EPR measurements of radical cations showed unique features for each PAH&#8208;TTF. The dications, formally composed of fluoreno[3,2&#8208;b]fluorene and diindeno[1,2&#8208;b:1',2'&#8208;i]anthracene cores, were experimentally found to exhibit singlet ground states. For the latter, calculations reveal the closed shell, quinoid singlet state to be isoenergetic with the open shell singlet diradical. Each charge state exhibited unique optical properties with radical cations absorbing strongly in the NIR region with signatures from&#160;&#960;&#8208;dimers for the large core.&#160;The experimental results were paralleled and supported by detailed computations, including&#160;spin density distribution calculations, EPR simulations, and&#160;nucleus independent chemical shift (NICS)&#160;xy&#160;scans.</dc:description>

Extended TTFs were thus prepared and studied for their geometrical properties (crystallography), redox properties, and UV/Vis/NIR/EPR characteristics as a function of charge state.

For the latter, calculations reveal the closed shell, quinoid singlet state to be isoenergetic with the open shell singlet diradical.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Fluorenone&#8208;containing Cyclo&#8208;paraphenylenes and their Late&#8208;Stage Transformation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) are the smallest possible armchair carbon nanotubes, the properties of which strongly depend on their ring sizes. They can be further tuned by either peripheral functionalizations or by replacing phenylene rings for other aromatic units. Here we show how four novel donor&#8208;acceptor chromophores are obtained by incorporating fluorenone or 2&#8208;(9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;9&#8208;ylidene)malononitrile into the loops of two differently sized CPPs. Synthetically, we managed to perform late&#8208;stage functionalization of the fluorenone&#8208;based rings by high&#8208;yielding Knoevenagel condensations. The structures were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses, revealing that replacing a phenylene for a fused&#8208;ring&#8208;system acceptor introduces additional strain. The donor&#8208;acceptor characters of the CPPs were supported by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopic studies, electrochemical studies (displaying the CPPs as multi&#8208;redox systems undergoing reversible or quasi&#8208;reversible redox events), as well as by computations. The oligophenylene parts were found to comprise the electron donor units of the macrocycles and the fluorenone parts the acceptor units.</dc:description>

         <title>Classical gold carbonyl complexes in tetrahedral and trigonal&#8208;planar settings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A unique four&#8208;coordinate, classical gold(I)&#8208;carbonyl complex with substantial backdonation from gold has been isolated using a B&#8208;methylated and fluorinated tris(pyridyl)borate chelator. Its lighter silver(I) and copper(I) analogs enabled a study of coinage metal family group trends. The B&#8208;arylated ligand version also afforded a gold carbon monoxide complex that displays a notably low C&#8208;O stretch value, but with a trigonal planar geometry at gold. A computational analysis shows that the Au(I)&#8208;CO bonds of these tris(pyridyl)borate ligand supported molecules consist of electrostatic attraction, OC&#8594;Au donation, and very significant Au&#8594;CO &#960;&#8208;back&#8208;bonding components. The latter is responsible for the observed C&#8208;O stretching frequencies that are lower than in free CO.</dc:description>

         <title>Rebound or Cage Escape? The Role of the Rebound Barrier for the Reactivity of Non&#8208;heme High&#8208;valent FeIV=O species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to their high reactivity and selectivity, variations in the spin ground state and a range of possible pathways, high&#8208;valent FeIV=O species are popular models with potential bioinspired applications. An interesting example of a structure&#8211;reactivity pattern is the detailed study with five nonheme amine&#8208;pyridine pentadentate ligand FeIV=O species, including N4py: [(L1)FeIV=O]2+ (1), bntpen: [(L2)FeIV=O]2+ (2), py2tacn: [(L3)FeIV=O]2+ (3), and two isomeric bispidine derivatives: [(L4)FeIV=O]2+ (4) and [(L5)FeIV=O]2+ (5). In this set, the order of increasing reactivity in the hydroxylation of cyclohexane differs from that with cyclohexadiene as substrate. A comprehensive DFT, ab initio CASSCF/NEVPT2 and DLPNO&#8208;CCSD(T) study is presented to untangle the observed patterns. These are well reproduced when both activation barriers for the C&#8208;H abstraction and the OH rebound are taken into account. An MO, NBO and deformation energy analysis reveals the importance of &#960;(pyr) &#224; &#960;*xz(FeIII&#8208;OH) electron donation for weakening the FeIII&#8208;OH bond and thus reducing the rebound barrier. This requires that pyridine rings are oriented perpendicularly to the FeIII&#8211;OH bond, i.e., this is a subtle but crucial point in ligand design for non&#8208;heme iron alkane hydroxylation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Reaching the formidable C&#8208;H corners has been one of the top priorities of organic chemists in the recent past. This prompted us to disclose herein a vicinal annulation of 2&#8208;iodo benzoates, indoles and carbazoles with N&#8208;embedded 1,6&#8208;enynes through 7&#8208;/8&#8208;membered palladacycles. The relay does not require the assistance of any directing group, leading to multi&#8208;cyclic scaffolds which are readily diversified to an array of adducts (with new functional tethers and/or 3 contiguous stereocenters) where we showcase a rare benzylic mono&#8208;oxygenation.</dc:description>

         <title>Amido Silicon Chalcogenides: New Cage Compounds Derived From The Bicyclic Silicon(I) Ring Compound Si4{N(SiMe3)Mes}4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bicyclic silicon(I) ring compound Si4{N(SiMe3)Mes}42 was used as starting material in reactions with chalcogens and chalcogen transfer agents at low temperatures. This results in the selective formation of new cage compounds. With Me3NO a silicon oxide with adamantane&#8208;type cage 3 was isolated that represents the first isolated T4 silsesquioxane. The reactions propylenesulfide and red selenium gave direct access to defect heterocubane&#8208;type cages 4 and 5 with three Si&#8211;Si bonds wherein the silicon atoms adopt different low oxidation states of +I and +III. A reaction with elemental tellurium even occurs below room temperature to provide a ditelluro&#8208;tetrasila&#8208;tricyclohexane 6.</dc:description>

         <title>Brook Rearrangement as Trigger for Dearomatization Reaction: Synthesis of Non&#8208;Aromatic N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The [1,2]&#8208;Brook rearrangement stands as a potent technique for constructing complex molecules. In this study, we showcase its power in the dearomatization of aromatic N&#8208;heterocycles. Through a concise four&#8208;step process that integrates lithiation, nucleophilic addition, Brook rearrangement and dearomatization reaction, we demonstrate a versatile strategy for generating diverse non&#8208;aromatic N&#8208;heterocycles which exhibit ambident reactivities. Various acyl silanes, halo&#8208;pyridines, and quinolines have been explored within this context. The synthetic utility of this methodology is demonstrated through the construction of complex architectures.</dc:description>

Through a concise four-step process that integrates lithiation, nucleophilic addition, Brook rearrangement and dearomatization reaction, we demonstrate a versatile strategy for generating diverse non-aromatic N-heterocycles which exhibit ambident reactivities. Various acyl silanes, halo-pyridines, and quinolines have been explored within this context. The synthetic utility of this methodology is demonstrated through the construction of complex architectures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;mediated Dehydrogenation of Hydroboranes and Group 14 Compounds: Base&#8208;stabilized Silylene and Germylene Complexes vs. Transmetalation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Monocarbonyl rhodium complex LRh(CO), 1, which is stabilized by a pyrrole&#8208;based bis(phosphinimine) pincer ligand (L = &#8232;&#954;3&#8208;NNN&#8217; = 2,5&#8208;[iPr2P=N(4&#8208;iPrC6H4)]2&#8208;N&#8217;(C4H2)&#8208;), serves as a versatile platform for the dehydrogenation of Group 14 substrates. Reaction with primary and secondary silanes and germanes (MesSiH3, Et2SiH2, Ph2GeH2, tBuGeH3; Mes = mesityl) liberates H2 and yields base&#8208;stabilized tertylene compounds of the form &#954;2&#8208;L(CO)Rh(ER2) (E = Si: R = Mes, H, 2; R = Et, 5; E= Ge: R = Ph, 6; R = tBu, H, 8). The &#8220;:ER2&#8221; fragment in these species bridges between the rhodium center and a phosphinimine donor. Preliminary reactions between pinacol (Pin) and &#954;2&#8208;L(CO)Rh(ER2), E = Si, Ge, indicate that such complexes can serve as silylene and germylene synthons, releasing:ER2 and catalytically generating PinER2. In contrast, combination of complex 1 and MesGeH3 does not yield the anticipated dehydrogenation product, but rather, transmetalation similar to that observed upon reaction between 1 and 3,5&#8208;dimethylphenylborane prevails.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Phosphoryltriacetates from White Phosphorus via Visible Light Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organophosphorus compounds (OPCs) are widely used in many fields. However, traditional synthetic routes in the industry usually involve multistep and hazardous procedures. Therefore, it&#8217;s of great significance to construct such compounds in an environmental&#8208;friendly and facile way. Herein, a photoredox catalytic method has been developed to construct novel phosphoryltriacetates. Using fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)3 (ppy = 2&#8208;phenylpyridine) as the photocatalyst and blue LEDs (456 nm) as the light source, white phosphorus can react with &#945;&#8208;bromo esters smoothly to generate phosphoryltriacetates in moderate to good yields. This one&#8208;step approach features mild reaction conditions and simple operational process without chlorination.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
A B(C6F5)3&#8208;catalyzed highly chemoselective [2+3]&#8208;cyclative diC&#8722;H functionalization of phenols tethered with propargylic ether motifs was developed for the synthesis of polycyclic compounds. Derivatizations of the phenol&#8208;OH group demonstrated the good variability of the cyclization products, indicating the potential application of this methodology in the preparation of other types of polycyclic compounds.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;free catalytic C&#8722;H functionalization is highly desired for the construction of C&#8722;C bonds. We herein report a highly chemoselective consecutive C&#8722;H [2+3]&#8208;cyclative functionalization for the simultaneous formation of two C&#8722;C bonds with construction of polycyclic phenols catalyzed by commercially available and low&#8208;cost B(C6F5)3. This catalytic system tolerates a wide range of substrate scope, providing a series of 2,6,7,8&#8208;tetrahydroacenaphthylen&#8208;3&#8208;ol&#8208;type polycyclic compounds efficiently. Several derivatizations of the catalytic products have also been conducted to show the potential application of this method in synthesis of polycyclic compounds.

         <title>Controlling the Formation of Electroactive Graphene&#8208;Based Cementitious Composites: Towards Structural Health Monitoring of Civil Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifunctional rGO&#8208;based cement composite featuring remarkably enhanced electrical properties was developed. Simple and efficient method for obtaining homogeneous and stable rGO dispersion in cement composites was established. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was applied to investigate the conduction mechanisms within rGO&#8208;based cement mortar and new electrical equivalent circuit was proposed.







Abstract
The development of composites combining multiple components each one imparting a specific function to the ensemble is highly sought after for disruptive applications in chemistry and materials science, with a particular importance for the realization of smart structures. Here, we report on the development of an unprecedented multifunctional cementitious composite incorporating reduced graphene oxide (rGO). By design, this material features significantly enhanced electrical properties while retaining the excellent cement's hydration and microstructure. The multiscale investigation on the chemical and physical properties of the dispersion made it possible to establish an efficient preparation protocol for rGO aqueous dispersion as well as rGO&#8208;based cementitious composites using a commercial poly(carboxylate ether)&#8208;based superplasticizer. The conduction mechanisms within the matrix of rGO containing mortars were unraveled by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealing conductive paths originating from bulk cement matrix and rGO nanosheets in composites with rGO loadings as low as 0.075&#8197;wt.&#8201;%. For this rGO loading, we observed the reduction of the resistivity of bulk cement mortar layers from 18.3&#8197;M&#937;&#8201;cm to 2.8&#8197;M&#937;&#8201;cm. Moreover, the addition of 0.2&#8197;wt.&#8201;% of rGO resulted in the formation of rGO conductive paths with the resistivity of 51.1&#8197;k&#937;&#8201;cm. These findings represent a major step forward towards the practical application of graphene&#8208;based materials in structural health monitoring of concrete structures.

         <title>Boosting the Cell Performance of the SiO/Cu and SiO/PPy Anodes via In&#8208;Situ Reduction/Oxidation Coating Strategies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The SiO/Cu and SiO/PPy composites are prepared by in&#8208;situ reduction/oxidation of Cu2+ and Py on the discharged/charged SiO surface, respectively. Cu and ppy coating layer enhance the conductivity of composite and mitigate volume expansion, which significantly improves the electrochemical performance of the SiO anode.







Abstract
Silicon monoxide (SiO) has attracted great attention due to its high theoretical specific capacity as an alternative material for conventional graphite anode, but its poor electrical conductivity and irreversible side reactions at the SiO/electrolyte interface seriously reduce its cycling stability. Here, to overcome the drawbacks, the dicharged SiO anode coated with Cu coating layer is elaborately designed by in&#8208;situ reduction method. Compared with the pristine SiO anode of lithium&#8208;ion battery (293&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200&#8197;cycles), the obtained SiO/Cu composite presents superior cycling stability (1206&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200&#8197;cycles). The tight combination of Cu particles and SiO significantly improves the conductivity of the composite, effectively inhibits the side&#8208;reaction between the active material and electrolyte. In addition, polypyrrole&#8208;coated SiO composites are further prepared by in&#8208;situ oxidation method, which delivers a high reversible specific capacity of 1311&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200&#8197;cycles. The in&#8208;situ coating strategies in this work provide a new pathway for the development and practical application of high&#8208;performance silicon&#8208;based anode.

         <title>Mechanistic Study on Selenium&#8208; and Sulfur&#8208;Mediated Isomerization of Hydroxamic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of para&#8208;aminophenols, such as paracetamol, holds high interest in pharmaceutical applications. In this study, the mechanistic transformations involved in the selenium&#8208; and sulfur&#8208;mediated formation of these compounds from hydroxamic acid were investigated computationally. Calculations with density functional theory (DFT) methods and experimental studies reveal the formation of ortho&#8208;sulfoxide as a product of the sulfur&#8208;mediated reaction.







Abstract
An in&#8208;depth computational study reveals the intriguing mechanism of the recently reported isomerization of hydroxamic acids into para&#8208;aminophenols catalyzed by phenylselenyl bromide under mild conditions. The computations not only align with the reported experimental data, effectively explaining observed phenomena such as para&#8208;selectivity but also shed light on crucial aspects of the reaction mechanism that establish limitations on the scope of the studied rearrangement. Additionally, a joint theoretical/experimental study was performed to examine the potency of the phenylsulfenyl bromide to mediate the reaction under the same conditions.

         <title>Dual Strategies with Anion/Cation Co&#8208;Doping and Lithium Carbonate Coating to Enhance the Electrochemical Performance of Lithium&#8208;Rich Layered Oxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lithium&#8208;rich layered oxides (LLOs, Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2) were successfully prepared based on a dual modification strategy, by co doped with anions and cations and coated with lithium carbonate coating. It founds that modified LLOs possess excellent electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;rich layered oxides (LLOs, Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2) are widely used as cathode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to its high specific capacity, high operating voltage and low cost. However, the LLOs are faced with rapid decay of charge/discharge capacity and voltage, as well as interface side reactions, which limit its electrochemical performance. Herein, the dual strategies of sulfite/sodium ion co&#8208;doping and lithium carbonate coating were used to improve it. It founds that modified LLOs achieve 88.74&#8201;% initial coulomb efficiency, 295.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 first turn discharge capacity, in addition to 216.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;C, and 87.23&#8201;% capacity retention after 100&#8197;cycles. Mechanism research indicated that the excellent electrochemical performance benefits from the doping of both Na+ and SO32&#8722;, and it could significantly reduce the migration energy barrier of Li+ and promote Li+ migration. Meanwhile, anion and cation are co&#8208;doped greatly reduces the band gap of LLOs and increase its electrical conductivity, and its binding effect on Li+ is weakened, making it easier for Li+ to shuttle through the material. In addition, the lithium carbonate coating significantly inhibits the occurrence of interfacial side reactions of LLOs. This work provides a theoretical basis and practical guidance for the further development of LLOs with higher electrochemical performance.

         <title>Highly Stable Perovskite Solar Cells Based on the Efficient Interaction between Pb2+ and Cyano Groups of 4&#8208;Aminophthalonitrile</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using 4&#8208;APN to manage surface defects in perovskite film, highly stable perovskite solar cells have been achieved.







Abstract
Defects present on the top surface of perovskite films have a pronounced detrimental impact on the photovoltaic performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Consequently, the development of effective defect passivation strategies has become key in enhancing both the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of PSCs. In this study, a small molecule material, 4&#8208;Aminophthalonitrile (4&#8208;APN), was introduced as a means to mitigate surface defects within perovskite films. Obviously, 4&#8208;APN effectively passivates the defects at grain boundaries by combining cyano groups (&#8722;C&#8801;N) with Pb2+, significantly reducing the density of defect states, inhibiting non&#8208;radiative recombination at the interface, and promoting the charge transfer efficiency from the perovskite layer to the hole transport layer. The 4&#8208;APN modification led to a significant upswing in the PCE, while concurrently bolstering the overall device stability. Importantly, the devices on 4&#8208;APN as passivation additive exhibited negligible performance degradation aging for 1200&#8197;h.

         <title>A Three&#8208;Dimensional (3D) Framework of Freestanding Vanadium Nitride Nanowires for Dendrite&#8208;Free and Long Life&#8208;Span Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Freestanding vanadium nitride (VN) nanowires are established as Li host for Li metal anode. A lithiophilic Li3N interlayer is in&#8197;situ formed by the surface reaction between molten Li and VN. As a result, the VN&#8722;Li exhibits a dendrite&#8208;free morphology and significant improvements of the lifespan during cycling.







Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal is a promising anode candidate for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries owing to its high theoretical capacity and low electrochemical potential. However, uneven Li nucleation, uncontrollable dendritic growth, infinite voltage change and even safety issues hinder its commercial application. Herein, a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) framework of freestanding vanadium nitride nanowires (VN NWs) is established as Li host for dendrite&#8208;free Li metal anode. A lithiophilic Li3N interlayer which in&#8197;situ formed by the surface reaction between molten Li and VN NWs is utilized to guide a uniform Li nucleation and deposition within the skeleton, as well as avoid the dendrite formation. Meanwhile, VN NWs can decrease local current density, homogenize Li&#8208;ion flux and accommodate volume fluctuations of the anode due to its 3D structure with high electron conductivity. Thus, the corresponding composite Li metal anode delivers a long&#8208;life span of 500&#8197;cycles (1000&#8197;h) at a current density of 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and exhibits lower nucleation over&#8208;potential and voltage hysteresis at different current densities from 0.5~5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in carbonate electrolyte. In conclusion, this work provides a new type of scaffold with both high electronic conductivity and excellent lithiophilicity for stable Li anodes.

Thus, the corresponding composite Li metal anode delivers a long-life span of 500&#8197;cycles (1000&#8197;h) at a current density of 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and exhibits lower nucleation over-potential and voltage hysteresis at different current densities from 0.5~5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in carbonate electrolyte. In conclusion, this work provides a new type of scaffold with both high electronic conductivity and excellent lithiophilicity for stable Li anodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nitrogen Heterocycle Synthesis through Hydride Abstraction of Acyclic Carbamates and Related Species: Scope, Mechanism, Stereoselectivity, and Product Conformation Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acyliminium ions and related species can be formed through hydride abstraction reactions that obviate the need for leaving group installation and avoid issues of unfavorable equilibria. This allows for the study of several previously unappreciated reactivity properties of these species in the context of cyclization reactions, including intermediate geometry, transition state conformation, stereoselectivity and product geometry.







Abstract
Acyliminium ions and related species are potent electrophiles that can be quite valuable in the synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules. This manuscript describes a protocol to form these intermediates through hydride abstractions of easily accessible allylic carbamates, amides, and sulfonamides that avoids the reversibility that is possible in classical condensation&#8208;based routes. These intermediates are used in the preparation of a range of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, and in many cases high levels of stereocontrol are observed. Specifically areas of investigation include the impact of chemical structure on oxidation efficiency, the geometry of the intermediate iminium ions, the impact of a substrate stereocenter on stereocontrol, and an examination of transition state geometry.

         <title>Resolution of Expanded Porphyrinoids: A Path to Persistent Chirality and Appealing Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a summary of strategies for achieving the chiral resolution of expanded porphyrinoids. In many cases, the isolated enantiomers display unique chiroptical properties, features that reflect their extensive &#960;&#8208;electron conjugation pathways and unique metal complexation features. As a class, expanded porphyrinoids are expected to play a crucial role in the future production of chiral functional materials.







Abstract
Chirality is a fundamental characteristic of nature. Expanded porphyrinoids and their analogues offer an attractive platform for delving into the intricacies of chirality. Expanded porphyrinoids comprise pyrrolic macrocycles and related heterocyclic systems. As a class, expanded porphyrinoids are widely recognized for their flexible structural features, nontrivial coordination capabilities, and intriguing optical and electronic properties. With limited exceptions, their inherent conformational flexibility coupled with a low racemization barrier allows for the facile interchange between enantiomers. As a result, achieving the effective chiral resolution of individual enantiomers and the subsequent exploration of their chiroptical properties represents a significant challenge. This review summarizes strategies used to realize the chiral resolution of expanded porphyrinoids and the understanding of intrinsic chiroptical properties that has emerged from these separation efforts. It is our hope that this review will serve not only to codify our current understanding of chiral expanded porphyrinoids, but also inspire advances in the generalized area of chiral functional materials.

         <title>Fabrication of High Surface Area Fe/Fe3O4 with Enhanced Performance for Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel specific surface area and interconnected pores Fe/Fe3O4/PC composite is fabricated by a simple template method. The as&#8208;synthesized material possessing high electrochemically active surface area promote the occurrence of catalytic kinetics, therefore affording super electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction performance.







Abstract
The development of high&#8208;efficient and large&#8208;scale non&#8208;precious electrocatalysts to improve sluggish reaction kinetics plays a key role in enhancing electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) for ammonia production under mild condition. Herein, Fe3O4 and Fe supported by porous carbon (denoted as Fe/Fe3O4/PC&#8208;800) composite with a high specific surface area of 1004.1&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 was prepared via a simple template method. On one hand, the high surface area of Fe/Fe3O4/PC&#8208;800 provides a large area to enhance N2 adsorption and promote more protons and electrons to accelerate the reaction, thereby greatly improving the dynamics. On the other hand, mesoporous Fe/Fe3O4/PC&#8208;800 provides high electrochemically active surface area for promoting the occurrence of catalytic kinetics. As a result, Fe/Fe3O4/PC&#8208;800 exhibited significantly enhanced NRR performance with an ammonia yield of 31.15&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1cat. and faraday efficiency of 22.26&#8201;% at &#8722;0.1&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). This study is expected to provide a new strategy for the synthesis of catalysts with large specific area and pave the way for the foundational research in NRR.

         <dc:description>
Through dearomative spirocyclization of a furan and N&#8208;tosylhydrazone with palladium catalysis, concise syntheses of cephalotaxus alkaloids, fortuneicyclidins A and B, and cephalotine&#8197;B have been accomplished. These natural products have a highly fused polycyclic skeleton including an azaspirocycle. By orchestrating the dearomative azaspirocyclization and a tandem reaction to construct the main skeleton, these natural products can be reached in only eight or nine steps. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y. Uwabe, K. Muto and J. Yamaguchi (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302769).

         <title>Heterobimetallic Complexes Bridged by an Unsymmetrical Bis(NHC) Ligand: Study of Enhanced Catalytic Activity in Tandem Transformations and Understanding of Cooperativity between the Metal Centers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective sequential metalation of a bis(NHC) ligand yielded the heterobimetallic complexes IrIII&#8722;M (M=PdII/AuI); these heterobimetallic catalysts exhibit clear advantages in various one&#8208;pot tandem catalytic reactions over the equivalent catalytic systems containing either the homobimetallic IrIII and PdII catalysts or the monometallic analogs. This superior activity could be correlated to a better communication/cooperativity between the two different metal centers as validated by NMR, electrochemical, and theoretical studies. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Rit and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302180).

         <title>Total Synthesis of Cyanobactin Natural Product Balgacyclamide B</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Balgacyclamide A&#8208;C are a family of cyanobactin natural products isolated from freshwater cyanobacteria&#160;Microcystis aeruginosa. These macrocyclic peptides are characterized by their oxazoline&#8208;thiazole core, their 7 or 8 stereocenters, and their antiparasitic activities. Balgacyclamide B is known for its activity towards&#160;Plasmodium falciparum&#160;chloroquine&#8208;resistant strain K1,&#160;Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense,&#160;and&#160;Leishmania donovani. In this report, the first total synthesis of Balgacyclamide B is described in a 17&#8208;steps pathway and a 2% overall yield. The synthetic pathway toward balgacyclamide B can be adapted for the future syntheses of balgacyclamide A and C. In addition, a brief history background of oxazolines syntheses is shown to emphasize the importance of the cyclization conditions used to interconvert or retain configuration of&#160;b&#8208;hydroxy amides via dehydrative cyclization.</dc:description>

         <title>Organophotocatalyzed Alkyl/Arylsulfonylation of Vinylcyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Allyl sulfones are an essential pharmacophore in many bioactive compounds. To combat their synthetic barrier, we report a practical, straightforward organophotocatalyzed&#160;methodology for accessing miscellaneously functionalized allyl sulfone derivatives using inexpensive and bench&#8208;stable sodium sulfinate salts under mild conditions. This photo&#8208;catalyzed radical sulfonylation provides access to a variety of allyl sulfones in good to excellent yields with high E:Z selectivity. A wide range of vinyl cyclopropanes, as well as aryl/hetero and alkyl sodium sulfinates, were tolerated and reliable in gram&#8208;scale synthesis. Later on, further functionalization of allyl sulfones was demonstrated. A plausible mechanism is proposed for radical sulfonylation with the control experiments.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New synthesized bipyrimidine&#8208;based chromophores presenting alkoxystyryl donor groups carrying aliphatic achiral and chiral chains in the 4 position, connected to electron&#8208;accepting 2,2&#8208;bipyrimidine cores have been synthesized. Their linear and nonlinear optical properties were investigated as well as their mesomorphic properties by various techniques (light&#8208;transmission measurements, polarized&#8208;light optical microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry measurements and two&#8208;photon excited fluorescence). &#160;The derivatives with achiral linear carbon chains were found to exhibit liquid&#8208;crystal properties with the formation smectic phases over large temperature ranges which were confirmed by small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering analysis via stacking models. The nonlinear optical properties in the solid state for derivatives with C14 and the citronellol chains have been studied by wide&#8208;field second&#8208;harmonic generation and multi&#8208;photon fluorescence imaging, confirming centrosymmetry for these achiral mesogens and their excellent third&#8208;order nonlinearity whereas the chiral compound exhibits non&#8208;centrosymmetric organization resulting in a strong Second Harmonic Generation at the crystal state.</dc:description>

         <title>Reductive Release from a Hybrid PKS&#8208;NRPS during the Biosynthesis of Pyrichalasin H</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three central steps during the biosynthesis of cytochalasan precursors, including reductive release, Knoevenagel cyclisation and Diels Alder cyclisation are not yet understood at a detailed molecular level. In this work we investigated the reductive release step catalysed by a hybrid polyketide synthase non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase (PKS&#8208;NRPS) from the pyrichalasin H pathway. Synthetic thiolesters were used as substrate mimics for in vitro studies with the isolated reduction (R) and holo&#8208;thiolation (T) domains of the PKS&#8208;NRPS hybrid PyiS. These assays demonstrate that the PyiS R&#8208;domain mainly catalyses an NADPH&#8208;dependent reductive release of an aldehyde intermediate that quickly undergoes spontaneous Knoevenagel cyclisation. The R&#8208;domain can only process substrates that are covalently bound to the phosphopantetheine thiol of the upstream T&#8208;domain, but it shows little selectivity for the polyketide.</dc:description>

         <title>Colloidal and Thermal Stability of Three&#8208;Component Hybrid Materials containing Clay Mineral, Polysaccharide and Surfactant</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The paper presents the colloidal and thermal stability of the three&#8208;component hybrid materials containing halloysite, polysaccharides (alginic acid, cationic cellulose and hydroxyethyl cellulose) and Tritons. TX&#8208;100, TX&#8208;165 and TX&#8208;405 were used as non&#8208;ionic surfactants. Stability and other properties of the hybrid materials were tested by the following methods: UV&#8208;Vis, TGA (thermogravimetric analysis) and DSC (differential scanning calorimetry), CHN (elemental analysis), SEM&#8208;EDX (scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X&#8208;Ray spectroscopy) and tensiometry. According to the results with the increasing polymer concentration the colloidal stability of the tested systems also increases. Moreover, the addition of the surfactants causes the increase of polysaccharide adsorption but the colloidal stability of the tested systems decreases due to large weights of formed aggregates. As follows from the thermal analysis, the comparison of the TG/DTG&#8208;DSC curves obtained for the investigated polymers confirms that their thermal decomposition courses have some common features. The obtained results have the application potential in the formation of the materials for the pollutants removal from water and sewages.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable Metal&#8208;free Imidazole&#8208;Benzimidazole Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Reduction in Aqueous Solutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of metal&#8208;free imidazole&#8208;benzimidazole catalysts (ImBenz&#8208;H, ImBenz&#8208;NO2, ImBenz&#8208;OCH3) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) were prepared. We demonstrate that the electrocatalytic O2 reduction by ImBenz&#8208;NO2 with the electron&#8208;withdrawing group showed high selectivity toward H2O with the number of electrons transferred (n = 3.7) in a neutral aqueous solution. The highest ORR selectivity toward H2O2 was achieved using ImBenz&#8208;H (n = 2.4) in an alkaline solution. Electrochemical studies of reaction kinetics disclosed that the highest turnover frequencies were obtained from ImBenz&#8208;H in both neutral and alkaline aqueous solutions. The results prove that the ORR selectivity is tunable by modulating the substituent of the ImBenz catalysts. Furthermore, DFT calculations suggested that the ORR mechanism of ImBenz&#8208;H involves the electron transfer from imidazole&#8208;benzimidazole to O2 resulting in the formation of H2O2 which supports the redox active properties of the catalysts ImBenz.</dc:description>

         <title>The Diversity of Cucurbituril Molecular Switches and Shuttles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enriching shuttling of cucurbiturils. The number and complexity of supramolecular systems featured by cucurbituril macrocycles shuttling over other molecules do not cease to increase. This concept article discusses the recent advances in the field and proposes challenges to tackle.







Abstract
Ring translocation switches and shuttles featuring a macrocycle (or a ring molecule) navigating between two or more stations continue to attract attention. While the vast majority of these systems are developed in organic solvents, the cucurbituril (CB) macrocycles are ideally suited to prepare such systems in water. Indeed, their stability and their relatively high affinity for relevant guest molecules are key attributes toward translating the progresses made in organic solvents, into water. This concept article summarizes the findings, key advances and multiple possibilities offered by CBs toward advanced molecular switches and shuttles in water.

While the vast majority of these systems are developed in organic solvents, the cucurbituril (CB) macrocycles are ideally suited to prepare such systems in water. Indeed, their stability and their relatively high affinity for relevant guest molecules are key attributes toward translating the progresses made in organic solvents, into water. This concept article summarizes the findings, key advances and multiple possibilities offered by CBs toward advanced molecular switches and shuttles in water.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Metal&#8208;Free Molecular Ferroelectric [4&#8208;Me&#8208;cyclohexylamine]ClO4 Introduced by Boat and Chair Conformations of Cyclohexylamine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic ferroelectrics have received a great deal of interest due to their exclusive&#160;properties. However, organic ferroelectrics have not been fully explored, which hinders their practical application. Here, we presented a novel metal&#8208;free organic molecular ferroelectric [4&#8208;MCHA][ClO4] (1) (4&#8208;MCHA = trans&#8208;4&#8208;methylcyclohexylamine), which exhibits an above&#8208;room&#8208;temperature of 328 K. Strikingly, the crystal structure analysis of 1 shows that the driving force of phase transition is related to the interesting chair&#8208;boat conformation change of 4&#8208;MCHA cation, in addition to&#160; the order&#8208;disorder transition. Using piezoelectric response force microscopy (PFM), the presence of domains and the implemented polarization switching was clearly observed, which explicitly determined the presence of room&#8208;temperature ferroelectricity of 1. As far as we know, the ferroelectric phase transition mechanism attributed to the conformational change in a trans isomeric cation is very rare. This research enriched the path of designing ferroelectric materials and smart materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Simulating non&#8208;adiabatic dynamics of photoexcited phenyl azide: Investigating electronic and structural relaxation en route to the formation of phenyl nitrene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Excited state molecular dynamics simulations of the photoexcited phenyl azide have been performed. The semi&#8208;classical surface hopping approximation has enabled an unconstrained analysis of the electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom which contribute to the molecular dissociation of phenyl azide into phenyl nitrene and molecular nitrogen. The significance of the second singlet excited state in leading the photodissociation has been established through electronic structure calculations, based on multiconfigurational schemes, and state population dynamics. The investigations on the structural dynamics have revealed the N &#8722; N bond separation to be accompanied by synchronous changes in the azide N &#8722; N &#8722; N bond angle. The 100 fs simulation results in a nitrene fragment that is electronically excited in the singlet manifold.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding the Electronic Structure of Magnetic Trinuclear Complexes Based on the Tris&#8208;dioxolene Triphenylene Non&#8208;innocent Bridging Ligand, a Theoretical Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A complete theoretical analysis using first the simple H&#252;ckel model followed by more sophisticated multi&#8208;reference calculations on a trinuclear Ni(II) complex (Tp#Ni3HHTP), bearing the non&#8208;innocent bridging ligand HHTP3&#8208;, is carried out. The three semiquinone moieties of HHTP3&#8208;&#160;couple antiferromagnetically and lead to a single unpaired electron localized on one of the moieties. The calculated exchange coupling integrals together with the zero&#8208;field parameters allow, when varied within a certain range, reproducing the experimental data. These results are generalized for two similar other trinuclear complexes containing Ni(II) and Cu(II). The electronic structure of HHTP3&#8208;&#160;turns out to be independent of both the chemical nature and the geometry of the metal ions. We also establish a direct correlation between the geometrical and the electronic structures of the non&#8208;innocent ligand that is consistent with the results of calculations. It allows experimentalists to get insight into the magnetic behavior of this type of complexes by an analysis of their X&#8208;ray structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuneable Plasmonic Resonances Of A Dynamic Thin Film Of Ultrasmall Nanocrystals Modified In the Anti&#8208;Galvanic Reduction Process</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented plasmonic enhancement in ultra&#8208;small gold nanoparticles modified with Anti&#8208;Galvanic Reduction gives access to new type pseudo liquid&#8208;crystalline nanoparticles. Thermoswitchable structure and induced plasmonic properties provide a general and straightforward access to a variety of a new type of plasmonic materials based on small gold nanoparticles.







Abstract
Ultrasmall gold nanoparticles (NPs) have revolutionized nanotechnology as they are an excellent starting substrate for the synthesis of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials with photonic or energy conversion applications, often with a responsive nature. However, ultrasmall NPs do not sustain plasmonic resonances, preventing their use in plasmon&#8208;related applications. In the presented work, we show a method of chemical modification of ultrasmall gold nanoparticles in order to fabricate dynamically controlled plasmonic thin films. For this purpose, we used the Anti&#8208;Galvanic Reduction process (AGR) to modify the surface of small gold nanoparticles, inducing plasmonic properties without notable size increases. Au@Ag NPs are then modified with liquid crystal&#8208;like organic ligands. The obtained NPs can assemble into densely packed films with long&#8208;range order and temperature&#8208;dependent structural properties. Namely, we detect two, fully reversible phase transitions between the hexagonal and cubic symmetries. The combination of AGR and organic surface modifications enabled us to demonstrate the possibility of managing plasmonic properties in the thin film of ~2&#8197;nm diameter metallic NPs.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of N&#8722;N Biaryl Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although N&#8722;N Biaryl atropisomers has emerged into valuable scaffolds in natural products, drug design and asymmetric synthesis, its asymmetric synthesis is scare until recently. This concept will focus on the asymmetric synthesis of the divergent N&#8722;N biaryl atropisomers scaffolds including N&#8722;N bipyrroles atropisomers, N&#8722;N pyrrole&#8722;indole atropisomers, N&#8722;N bisindoles atropisomers, N&#8722;N indole&#8722;carbazole atropisomers.







Abstract
Atropisomers have emerged as important structural scaffolds in natural products, drug design, and asymmetric synthesis. Recently, N&#8722;N biaryl atropisomers have drawn increasing interest due to their unique structure and relatively stable axes. However, its asymmetric synthesis remains scarce compared to its well&#8208;developed C&#8722;C biaryl analogs. In this concept, we summarize the asymmetric synthesis of N&#8722;N biaryl atropisomers including N&#8722;N pyrrole&#8722;pyrrole, N&#8722;N pyrrole&#8722;indole, N&#8722;N indole&#8722;indole, and N&#8722;N indole&#8722;carbazole, during which a series synthetic strategies are highlighted. Also, a synthetic evolution is briefly reviewed and an outlook of N&#8722;N biaryl atropisomers synthesis is offered.

         <title>Synthesis of the A&#8722;F Fragment of the Pacific Ciguatoxin CTX3C by Iterative Ring&#8208;Closing Metathesis and Tsuji&#8211;Trost Allylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fully functionalized A&#8722;F ring system of the Pacific ciguatoxin CTX3C suitable for coupling to the I&#8722;M fragment of the natural product, has been synthesized from a simple glucal derivative. A six&#8208;step sequence that features ring&#8208;closing metathesis and stereoselective palladium&#8208;mediated allylation has been deployed in an iterative manner to construct the medium&#8208;sized D and E rings.







Abstract
The fully functionalized A&#8722;F fragment of the Pacific ciguatoxin CTX3C has been synthesized from a derivative of D&#8208;glucal, which serves as the B&#8208;ring. Rings A and C were introduced to either side of ring B by ring&#8208;closing diene and enyne metathesis (RCM). The seven&#8208;membered D&#8208;ring and eight&#8208;membered E&#8208;ring were assembled by iterative use of a six&#8208;step reaction sequence in which RCM was used for ring construction and Tsuji&#8211;Trost allylation was employed for subsequent stereoselective functionalization. The nine&#8208;membered F&#8208;ring was formed by use of an RCM reaction and bears the functionality required for attachment of the I&#8722;M fragment and subsequent closure of rings G and H.

&lt;p&gt;The fully functionalized A&#8722;F ring system of the Pacific ciguatoxin CTX3C suitable for coupling to the I&#8722;M fragment of the natural product, has been synthesized from a simple glucal derivative. A six-step sequence that features ring-closing metathesis and stereoselective palladium-mediated allylation has been deployed in an iterative manner to construct the medium-sized D and E rings.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fully functionalized A&#8722;F fragment of the Pacific ciguatoxin CTX3C has been synthesized from a derivative of D-glucal, which serves as the B-ring. Rings A and C were introduced to either side of ring B by ring-closing diene and enyne metathesis (RCM). The seven-membered D-ring and eight-membered E-ring were assembled by iterative use of a six-step reaction sequence in which RCM was used for ring construction and Tsuji&#8211;Trost allylation was employed for subsequent stereoselective functionalization. The nine-membered F-ring was formed by use of an RCM reaction and bears the functionality required for attachment of the I&#8722;M fragment and subsequent closure of rings G and H.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multigram Synthesis of Dimethyl Stellane&#8208;1,5&#8208;Dicarboxylate as a Key Precursor for ortho&#8208;Benzene Mimics
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From a new C(sp3)&#8208;rich hydrocarbon cage, a potential ortho&#8208;substituted benzene analogue (bioisoster), up to 50&#8197;g of tricyclo[3.3.0.03,7]octane (stellane) 1,5&#8208;dicarboxylic acid derivatives can be produced in one run. The outcome of the synthesis hinges on the substrate's stereochemistry. While the endo,endo DMOD isomer only undergoes epimerization in the reaction conditions, others yield the sought&#8208;after stellane ester. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis shows stellane 1,5&#8208;dicarboxylic acid dimethyl ester as an ideal saturated alternative for ortho&#8208;disubstituted benzene with in&#8208;plane topology.







Abstract
Herein, we present previously unavailable C(sp3)&#8208;rich polycyclic hydrocarbon scaffolds that have the potential to become valuable tools in medicinal chemistry and crop science as saturated bioisosteres of benzenoids. We have developed a scalable protocol (up to 50&#8197;g from a single synthetic run) for the synthesis of tricyclo[3.3.0.03,7]octane (bisnoradamantane or stellane) 1,5&#8208;dicarboxylic acid derivatives. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of the stellane 1,5&#8208;dicarboxylic acid dimethyl ester has revealed that this scaffold is an optimal saturated isostere for ortho&#8208;disubstituted benzene where substituents exhibit in&#8208;plane topology. The synthetic protocol is based on the oxidative cyclization of dimethyl octahydropentalene&#8208;2,5&#8208;dicarboxylate (DMOD) through lithiation followed by I2 oxidation. The reaction outcome is determined by the stereochemistry of the substrate. While the endo,endo cis&#8208;DMOD, exclusively gives the &#8220;unwanted&#8221; Claisen cyclization product, the exo,endo cis&#8208; and exo,exo cis&#8208; stereoisomers afford the desired stellane 1,5&#8208;dicarboxylic acid dimethyl ester quantitatively. DFT computations have revealed that the reaction proceeds via the dianion of dimethyl octahydropentalene&#8208;2,5&#8208;dicarboxylate, which undergoes SET oxidation by I2 to form a radical anion. The subsequent cyclization followed by a second SET oxidation gives the desired stellane derivative.

         <title>Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Based Fluorescent Supramolecular Polymers Without Conventional Chromophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel fluorescent supramolecular polymer without conventional chromophores have been reported.







Abstract
Fluorescent supramolecular polymers have garnered significant attention due to their successful integration of supramolecular polymers and fluorescence, offering vast potential for applications in sensing, imaging, optoelectronics, and photonics. In this study, we present a novel supramolecular polymer based on P5&#8208;OH, derived from mono&#8208;substituted pillararene macrocycles. Notably, these formed supramolecular polymeric aggregates exhibit a prominent blue emission, representing a rare instance of fluorescent polymers devoid of conventional chromophores. Furthermore, through the modification of alkyl chain ending groups attached to pillar[5]arenes, slight shifts in the emission peak could be observed. This research expands the scope of functional supramolecular polymeric systems utilizing pillararenes, providing valuable insights for the design of innovative luminescent materials and optical devices.

         <title>Dyads and Triads of Boron Difluoride Formazanate and Boron Difluoride Dipyrromethene Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of BF2 formazanate and BODIPY conjugates: Dyads and triads of BF2 formazanate and BODIPY dyes undergo reversible reduction to polyanions and exhibit anti&#8208;Kasha photoluminescence. These properties arise from the interplay of the discrete properties of each dye and highlight the promise of dye&#8208;dye conjugates based on BF2 formazanates.







Abstract
Dye&#8208;dye conjugates have attracted significant interest for their utility in applications such as bioimaging, theranostics, and light&#8208;harvesting. Many classes of organic dyes have been employed in this regard; however, building blocks don't typically extend beyond small chromophores. This can lead to minor changes to the optoelectronic properties of the original dye. The exploration of dye&#8211;dye structures is impeded by long synthetic routes, incompatible synthetic conditions, or a mismatch of the desired properties. Here, we present the first&#8208;of&#8208;their&#8208;kind dye&#8208;dye conjugates of boron difluoride complexes of formazanate and dipyrromethene ligands. These conjugates exhibit dual photoluminescence bands that reach the near&#8208;infrared spectral region and implicate anti&#8208;Kasha processes. Cyclic voltammetry experiments revealed the generation of polyanionic species that can reversibly tolerate the uptake of up to 6 electrons. Ultimately, we demonstrate that BF2 formazanates can serve as a synthetically accessible platform to build upon new classes of dye&#8208;dye conjugates.

         <title>Dioxygen Activation and Reduction by a Soluble Iron Phthalocyanine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic Oxygen activation by square planar iron. A well soluble phthalocyanine derivative stabilizes a square planar Fe2+ centre with S=1 paramagnetism. The bulky substituents prevent the formation of aggregates while leaving a large cavity at the metal for stoichiometric and catalytic reactions. The compound can be used as a molecular model for studying dioxygen reduction and catalytic oxygenation.







Abstract
Iron ions in a square&#8208;planar coordination can bind molecules at the vacant axial positions and are able to transform them in stoichiometric and catalytic reactions. Nature takes advantage of these properties by incorporating iron into porphyrin systems, which play a key role not only in the binding and transport of oxygen, but also in catalytic oxidation and reduction reactions involving cytochrome P450. Although these systems have been studied extensively, there are still unresolved questions regarding the interplay between the iron ions and the surrounding ligands. Phthalocyanines (Pc) create a similar environment for metal atoms and FePc is known for a long time. However, without axial ligands FePc aggregates leading to solids of low solubility. In this work we used a known six&#8208;coordinate iron phthalocyanine derivative with bulky substituents and removed the stabilizing axial ligands. The resulting paramagnetic, four&#8208;coordinate compound does not aggregate and dissolves well so that NMR spectroscopy can be employed for studying the molecular structure and the reactivity. Solvent molecules bind weakly to the iron centers and oxygen is reduced in the presence of H&#8208;atom donors. The stoichiometric and catalytic reactivity with oxygen was studied in more detail.

         <title>Reactive Reductive Species Participating Photodynamic Therapy for Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reductive phototherapy takes advantage of endogenous substances such as GSH and NADH to drive photoredox catalysis and produce reactive reductive species (RRS) for antioxidant defense. The basic concept on RRSs (e.&#8201;g., H&#8901; and electrons) participating in reductive photodynamic therapy (R&#8208;PDT) holds great potential in fighting cancers under extremely hypoxic conditions.







Abstract
Although the development of oxidative photodynamic therapy (O&#8208;PDT) based on reactive oxygen species (ROS) has led to great progress in cancer treatment, tumor hypoxia, cellular adaptation and intrinsic antioxidant defenses are still obstacles at this stage. Fortunately, with the discovery and development of reactive reductive species (RRS) in the PDT process, reductive PDT (R&#8208;PDT) is receiving increasing research interest. R&#8208;PDT with oxygen&#8208;independence is an effective reduction therapy that promises excellent therapeutic efficacy in extremely hypoxic or even anaerobic environments.

&lt;p&gt;Reductive phototherapy takes advantage of endogenous substances such as GSH and NADH to drive photoredox catalysis and produce reactive reductive species (RRS) for antioxidant defense. The basic concept on RRSs (e.&#8201;g., H&#8901; and electrons) participating in reductive photodynamic therapy (R-PDT) holds great potential in fighting cancers under extremely hypoxic conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the development of oxidative photodynamic therapy (O-PDT) based on reactive oxygen species (ROS) has led to great progress in cancer treatment, tumor hypoxia, cellular adaptation and intrinsic antioxidant defenses are still obstacles at this stage. Fortunately, with the discovery and development of reactive reductive species (RRS) in the PDT process, reductive PDT (R-PDT) is receiving increasing research interest. R-PDT with oxygen-independence is an effective reduction therapy that promises excellent therapeutic efficacy in extremely hypoxic or even anaerobic environments.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Electrocatalyzed Synthesis of Bifuran&#8208;Based Monomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nickel&#8208;electrocatalyzed homocoupling is applied to the preparation of bifuran&#8208;based monomers from methyl bromo&#8208;furancarboxylates that can be prepared from hemicellulose&#8208;based furfural. The protocol is run with graphite electrodes in an undivided cell, and the products are isolated by precipitation.







Abstract
Bifuran motifs can be accessed with nickel&#8208;bipyridine electrocatalyzed homocouplings of bromine&#8208;substituted methyl furancarboxylates, which, in turn, can be prepared from hemicellulose&#8208;derived furfural. The described protocol uses sustainable carbon&#8208;based graphite electrodes in the simplest setup &#8211; an undivided cell with constant current electrolysis. The reported method avoids using a sacrificial anode by employing triethanolamine as an electron donor.

         <title>Alcohol&#8208;Induced Conformation Changes and Thermodynamic Signatures in the Binding of Polyphenols to Proline&#8208;Rich Salivary Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first contact of polyphenols, such as tannins from red grapes, with the human body takes place in the mouth, where they interact with salivary proteins. These interactions are important at the sensory level, especially for the development of astringency. We have studied the binding process of the polyphenol ellagic acid to different salivary proteins. The presence of 10&#8197;vol.&#8201;% EtOH, as found in wines, dramatically increases the binding constant of ellagic acid with salivary proteins; this can be attributed to the effect of EtOH on the conformational dynamics and hydration of the proteins. More information can be found in the Research Article by N. Jahmidi&#8208;Azizi, R. Oliva and R. Winter (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302384).

         <title>Disulfide&#8208;Driven Pore Functionalization of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 61, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new post&#8208;synthetic modification strategy for metal&#8211;organic frameworks is presented. Diverse functional groups are installed within an analogue of MIL&#8208;53(Al) via disulfide bonds.







Abstract
Post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) imparts additional functionality to metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) that is often difficult to access using solvothermal synthesis. As such, expanding the repertory of PSM reactions available to the practitioner is of increased importance for the generation of materials tailored for desired applications. Herein, a method is described for the protecting group&#8208;free installation of diverse functional groups within the pores of a MIL&#8208;53(Al) analogue via disulfide bond formation. The majority of the reactions proceed with thiol&#8208;to&#8208;disulfide conversions ranging from high to nearly quantitative. The disulfide bonds are stable in various solvents and can be cleaved in the presence of a reducing agent.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 61, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intramolecular singlet fission (i&#8208;SF) mechanism of INDT dimers linked via para&#8208;phenyl, meta&#8208;phenyl and fluorene bridging groups is investigated. Using ultra&#8208;fast spectroscopy the highest rate of singlet fission is found in the para&#8208;phenyl linked dimer. The mechanistic picture of polarisable singlet fission materials, such as INDT, extends beyond the traditional mechanistic landscape.







Abstract
Singlet fission is a phenomenon that could significantly improve the efficiency of photovoltaic devices. Indolonaphthyridine thiophene (INDT) is a photostable singlet fission material that could potentially be utilised in singlet fission&#8208;based photovoltaic devices. This study investigates the intramolecular singlet fission (i&#8208;SF) mechanism of INDT dimers linked via para&#8208;phenyl, meta&#8208;phenyl and fluorene bridging groups. Using ultra&#8208;fast spectroscopy the highest rate of singlet fission is found in the para&#8208;phenyl linked dimer. Quantum calculations show the para&#8208;phenyl linker encourages enhanced monomer electronic coupling. Increased rates of singlet fission were also observed in the higher polarity o&#8208;dichlorobenzene, relative to toluene, indicating that charge&#8208;transfer states have a role in mediating the process. The mechanistic picture of polarisable singlet fission materials, such as INDT, extends beyond the traditional mechanistic landscape.

Abstract
Chirality analysis of small molecules for the determination of their enantiopurity is nowadays ruled by streamlined chromatographic methods which utilize chiral stationary phases. Chiroptical probes which rely on host&#8211;guest interactions are so far overshadowed by the latter but have the benefit of depending only on common spectroscopic techniques such as CD spectroscopy to distinguish enantiomers and to quantify their ratio. Interest into this receptor&#8208;based approach is constantly rising because non&#8208;invasive high&#8208;throughput screenings with a minimal waste production can be performed. In this study we investigate the possibility to utilize metal&#8208;based containers in form of charge&#8208;neutral helicates able to recognize anions for this purpose. Key building block of the helicates are triazole units which show rotational freedom and give rise to either a meso&#8208;structure or a racemic mixture of the right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed complex. A chiroptical response of the probe is observed upon recognition of chiral mono&#8208; or dicarboxylates and chirality analysis of tartrate is conducted by CD spectroscopy.

Dancing hybridization: The first example of efficient and stereoselective (E)&#8208;1,3&#8208;enyne synthesis exclusively from alkene substrates is described. Inauguration of nitro group as a sacrificial directing group, formation of magical triple bond by promoting zero&#8208;order to third&#8208;order upgradation make this methodology atom and step efficient with sustainability.







Abstract
The involvement of nitroalkenes instead of minimal one alkyne motif for (E)&#8208;1,3&#8208;enynes synthesis through a palladium catalyzed stereoselective bond forming pathway at room temperature is presented. Implication of nitro group as a sacrificial directing group, formation of magical alkyne on a newly developed Csp3&#8208;Csp3 bond with initial palladium&#8208;MBH adduct make this methodology distinctive. This protocol features an unprecedented sequential acetate addition, carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation, isomerization of double bond and nitromethane degradation in a tandem catalytic walk via dancing hybridization. Mechanistic understanding through identification of intermediates and computational calculations furnishes complete insight into the tandem catalytic pathway. Broad substrates scope and functional groups tolerance make this synthetic methodology magnificent and dynamic. This represents the first example of stereoselective 1,3&#8208;enyne synthesis exclusively from alkene substrates by introducing the concept of sacrificial directing group.

         <title>Reduced Tiara&#8208;like Palladium Complex for Suzuki Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 61, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study describes the development of a highly active and reusable palladium&#8208;based catalyst on alumina (Pd8/Al2O3) derived from an octanuclear tiara&#8208;like palladium complex and exploited for Suzuki coupling reactions. The high specific activity of the catalyst allowed to complete the coupling reaction in 30&#8197;min using only 0.12&#8197;mol&#8201;% Pd loading under very mild and green reaction conditions.







Abstract
The design of highly active and structurally well&#8208;defined catalysts has become a crucial issue for heterogeneous catalysed reactions while reducing the amount of catalyst employed. Beside conventional synthetic routes, the employment of polynuclear transition metal complexes as catalysts or catalyst precursors has progressively intercepted a growing interest. These well&#8208;defined species promise to deliver catalytic systems where a strict control on the nuclearity allows to improve the catalytic performance while reducing the active phase loading. This study describes the development of a highly active and reusable palladium&#8208;based catalyst on alumina (Pd8/Al2O3) for Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling reactions. An octanuclear tiara&#8208;like palladium complex was selected as active phase precursor to give isolated Pd&#8208;clusters of ca. 1&#8197;nm in size on Al2O3. The catalyst was thoroughly characterised by several complementary techniques to assess its structural and chemical nature. The high specific activity of the catalyst has allowed to carry out the cross&#8208;coupling reaction in 30&#8197;min using only 0.12&#8197;mol&#8201;% of Pd loading under very mild and green reaction conditions. Screening of various substrates and selectivity tests, combined with recycling and benchmarking experiments, have been used to highlight the great potentialities of this new Pd8/Al2O3 catalyst.

         <title>Ru(II)&#8208;Cyanine Complexes as Promising Photodynamic Photosensitizers for the Treatment of Hypoxic Tumours with Highly Penetrating 770&#8197;nm Near&#8208;Infrared Light</title>

A novel class of Ruthenium(II) complexes that can be photoactivated at 770&#8197;nm under hypoxic conditions thanks to the incorporation of a heptamethine cyanine dye is described.







Abstract
Light&#8208;activated treatments, such as photodynamic therapy (PDT), provide temporal and spatial control over a specific cytotoxic response by exploiting toxicity differences between irradiated and dark conditions. In this work, a novel strategy for developing near infrared (NIR)&#8208;activatable Ru(II) polypyridyl&#8208;based photosensitizers (PSs) was successfully developed through the incorporation of symmetric heptamethine cyanine dyes in the metal complex via a phenanthrimidazole ligand. Owing to their strong absorption in the NIR region, the PSs could be efficiently photoactivated with highly penetrating NIR light (770&#8197;nm), leading to high photocytotoxicities towards several cancer cell lines under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Notably, our lead PS (Ru&#8208;Cyn&#8208;1), which accumulated in the mitochondria, exhibited a good photocytotoxic activity under challenging low&#8208;oxygen concentration (2&#8201;% O2) upon NIR light irradiation conditions (770&#8197;nm), owing to a combination of type I and II PDT mechanisms. The fact that the PS Protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), the metabolite of the clinically approved 5&#8208;ALA PS, was found inactive under the same challenging conditions positions Ru&#8208;Cyn&#8208;1 complex as a promising PDT agent for the treatment of deep&#8208;seated hypoxic tumours.

         <title>Direct Solution&#8208;Phase Synthesis and Functionalization of 2D WSe2 for Ambient Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 61, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simultaneous exfoliation and noncovalent functionalization of 2D WSe2 by commercial surfactants containing varying hydrophobic chain length and hydroxyl and mercapto head groups, which contribute to its long&#8208;term stability in aqueous suspension, is described.







Abstract
2H phase tungsten diselenide (WSe2) is a p&#8208;type 2D semiconductor from the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) family with unique optoelectrical properties. Solution phase production of atomically thin WSe2 is challenging due to its instability under ambient conditions. We present a highly efficient and scalable solution method for simultaneously exfoliating and functionalizing WSe2 by leveraging the non&#8208;covalent interaction between mercapto&#8208;group and bulk WSe2. Single and few&#8208;layer 2H phase pure WSe2 sheets of lateral size up to 5&#8197;&#956;m with minimal basal plane defects, as revealed by XPS, Raman and FTIR spectroscopy, are produced in a water&#8208;ethanol mixture. Remarkably, WSe2 dispersion remains stable even at high concentrations (10&#8197;mg/mL) and exhibited high colloidal stability with a shelf&#8208;life exceeding a year. The findings from our study suggest that through precise manipulation of intercalation chemistry, mass production of solution&#8208;processable phase&#8208;sensitive 2D materials such as WSe2 can be achieved. This advancement holds great potential for facilitating their practical utilization in various real&#8208;world applications.

We present a highly efficient and scalable solution method for simultaneously exfoliating and functionalizing WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by leveraging the non-covalent interaction between mercapto-group and bulk WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Single and few-layer 2H phase pure WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sheets of lateral size up to 5&#8197;&#956;m with minimal basal plane defects, as revealed by XPS, Raman and FTIR spectroscopy, are produced in a water-ethanol mixture. Remarkably, WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dispersion remains stable even at high concentrations (10&#8197;mg/mL) and exhibited high colloidal stability with a shelf-life exceeding a year. The findings from our study suggest that through precise manipulation of intercalation chemistry, mass production of solution-processable phase-sensitive 2D materials such as WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be achieved. This advancement holds great potential for facilitating their practical utilization in various real-world applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>DFT Study of Imine&#8208;Exchange Reactions in Iron(II)&#8208;Coordinated Pincers</title>

Proton shuttle: A DFT study on condensation and transimination reactions of an Fe2+&#8208;coordinated diimine pyridine pincer was conducted. Titration experiments confirmed the use of Fe2+ as a model metal ion, after which the reactions were investigated computationally using traditional four&#8208;membered ring transition states for proton transfer. When those displayed unrealistic high energy barriers, two ethylamines were added to function as proton shuttles, which lowered the activation energies to realistic values.







Abstract
The imine bond is among the most applied motifs in dynamic covalent chemistry. Although its uses are varied and often involve coordination to a transition metal for stability, mechanistic studies on imine exchange reactions so far have not included metal coordination. Herein, we investigated the condensation and transimination reactions of an Fe2+&#8208;coordinated diimine pyridine pincer, employing wB97XD/6&#8208;311G(2d,2p) DFT calculations in acetonitrile. We first experimentally confirmed that Fe2+ is strongly coordinated by these pincers, and is thus a justified model ion. When considering a four&#8208;membered ring&#8208;shaped transition state for proton transfers, the required activation energies for condensation and transimination reaction exceeded the values expected for reactions known to be spontaneous at room temperature. The nature of the incoming and exiting amines and the substituents on the para&#8208;position of the pincer had no effect on this. Replacing Fe2+ with Zn2+ or removing it altogether did not reduce it either. However, the addition of two ethylamine molecules lowered the energy barriers to be compatible with experiment (19.4 and 23.2&#8197;kcal/mol for condensation and transimination, respectively). Lastly, the energy barrier of condensation of a non&#8208;coordinated pincer was significantly higher than found for Fe2+&#8208;coordinating pincers, underlining the catalyzing effect of metal coordination on imine exchange reactions.

         <title>Elucidating the Excited State Behavior of Pyridyl Pyridinium Systems via Computational and Transient Absorption Studies of Tetrahedral Multichromophoric Arrays and their Model Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 61, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of tetrameric molecules with four identical subunits bearing pyridyl pyridinium or bipyridinium moieties has been investigated by means of steady&#8208;state and time resolved spectroscopy and the results are corroborated by computational studies. The behavior of the tetrameric molecules, when compared with that of the corresponding model compounds (one of the four identical arms), highlights a remarkable electronic interaction between the subunits in the array.







Abstract
The tetrahedral shape&#8208;persistent molecule 14+, containing four identical pyridyl pyridinium units connected via a sp3 hybridized carbon atom, has been investigated in detail by means of steady&#8208;state and time resolved spectroscopy. Remarkable photophysical properties are observed, particularly in comparison with protonated and methylated analogues (1H48+, 1Me48+), which exhibit substantially shorter excited state lifetimes and lower emission quantum yields. Theoretical studies have rationalized the behavior of the tetrameric molecules relative to the monomers, with DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations corroborating steady&#8208;state (absorption and emission) and transient absorption spectra. The behavior of the monomeric compounds (each consisting in one of the four identical subunits of the tetramers, i.&#8201;e., 2+, 2H2+ and 2Me2+) considerably differs from that of the tetramers, indicating a strong electronic interaction between the subunits in the tetrameric species, likely promoted by the homoconjugation through the connecting sp3&#8197;C atom. 2+ is characterized by a peculiar S1&#8208;S2 excited state inversion, whereas the short&#8208;lived emitting S1 state of 2H2+ and 2Me2+ exhibits a partial charge&#8208;transfer character, as substantiated by spectro&#8208;electrochemical studies. Among the six investigated systems, only 14+ is a sizeable luminophore (&#934;em=0.15), which is related to the peculiar features of its singlet state.

Naphthalene&#8208;embedded multi&#8208;resonance blue emitters based on N&#8722;B&#8722;O frameworks with different structural variation for finely tuning the photophysical properties, which enables effcient narrowband emissive organic light emitting diodes have been designed and investigated.







Abstract
Great achievements have been made in the development of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes in recent decades. However, achieving high color purity for blue emitters remains a challenge. In this study, we have designed and synthesized three naphthalene (NA)&#8208;embedded multi&#8208;resonance (MR) emitters, named SNA, SNB and SNB1, based on N&#8722;B&#8722;O frameworks with isomer variations for finely adjusting the photophysical properties. These emitters show tunable blue emission with emission peaks of 450&#8211;470&#8197;nm. Small full width of half maximum (FWHM) of 25&#8211;29&#8197;nm are achieved in these emitters, indicating the well maintaining of molecular rigidity and MR effect with NA extension. Such design also ensures a fast radiative decay. However, no obvious delayed fluorescence is observed in all three emitters due to the relatively large energy differences between the first singlet and triplet excited states. Both SNA and SNB enable high electroluminescent (EL) performance in doped devices with external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 7.2 and 7.9&#8201;%, respectively. When applying the sensitized strategy, devices based on SNA and SNB show huge improvement with EQE of 29.3 and 29.1&#8201;%. More importantly, SNB with twist geometry enables stable EL spectra with almost unchanged FWHM under different doping concentrations. This work demonstrates the potential of NA extension design in constructing narrowband emissive blue emitters.

         <title>Bridging the Gap between Zeolites and Dense Silica Polymorphs: Formation of All&#8208;Silica Zeolite with High Framework Density from Natural Layered Silicate Magadiite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 61, November 2, 2023. </description>

Between zeolite and silica: A silica zeolite RWZ&#8208;1 with a very high framework density (FD) was synthesized through topotactic condensation of natural layered silicate magadiite. Based on the viewpoint of its FD and thermal expansion behavior, RWZ&#8208;1 is regarded as a truly intermediate silica material between zeolites and dense silica polymorphs, which can be applicable as a unique catalyst and adsorbent.







Abstract
A silica zeolite (RWZ&#8208;1) with a very high framework density (FD) was synthesized from highly crystalline natural layered silicate magadiite, bridging the gap between the two research areas of zeolites and dense silica polymorphs. Magadiite was topotactically converted into a 3D framework through two&#8208;step heat treatment. The resulting structure had a 1D micropore system of channel&#8208;like cavities with an FD of 22.1 Si atoms/1000&#8197;&#197;3. This value is higher than those of all other silica zeolites reported so far, approaching those of silica polymorphs (tridymite (22.6) and &#945;&#8208;quartz (26.5)). RWZ&#8208;1 is a slight negative thermal expansion material with thermal properties approaching those of dense silica polymorphs. It contributes to the creation of a new field on microporous high&#8208;density silica/silicates. Synergistic interactions are expected between the micropores with molecular sieving properties and the dense layer&#8208;like building units with different topologies which provide thermal and mechanical stabilities.

&lt;p&gt;A silica zeolite (RWZ-1) with a very high framework density (FD) was synthesized from highly crystalline natural layered silicate magadiite, bridging the gap between the two research areas of zeolites and dense silica polymorphs. Magadiite was topotactically converted into a 3D framework through two-step heat treatment. The resulting structure had a 1D micropore system of channel-like cavities with an FD of 22.1 Si atoms/1000&#8197;&#197;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. This value is higher than those of all other silica zeolites reported so far, approaching those of silica polymorphs (tridymite (22.6) and &#945;-quartz (26.5)). RWZ-1 is a slight negative thermal expansion material with thermal properties approaching those of dense silica polymorphs. It contributes to the creation of a new field on microporous high-density silica/silicates. Synergistic interactions are expected between the micropores with molecular sieving properties and the dense layer-like building units with different topologies which provide thermal and mechanical stabilities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Diverse Reactions of Formazanate/Formazan with Tetrylenes: Reduction, C&#8722;H Bond Activation, Substitution and Addition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 61, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diverse redox chemistry of formazanate/formazan with low&#8208;valent group&#8197;14 compounds is inverstigated. Both formazanate potassium salt and neutral formazan ligands were subjected to reactions with tetrylenes. In the former case, the anticipated salt metathesis reactions occurred, accompanied by unexpected reduction/insertion and C&#8722;H activation. The latter reactions displayed substitution and addition reaction patterns.







Abstract
The reactivity of the formazanate potassium salt [LtBuK(thf)] (LtBu=PhNNC(4&#8208;tBuPh)NNPh) with the group&#8197;14 chlorotetrylenes [{PhC(tBuN)2}ECl] (E=Si, Ge, Sn) was investigated. Three corresponding compounds with unique configurations were formed, demonstrating the diverse reactivity of the system. In addition to the anticipated salt metathesis reactions of the potassium salt with the chlorine function of tetrylenes, unexpected reduction/insertion steps into the N=N bond of the formazanate (Si, Ge) and subsequent C&#8722;H activation (Ge) were also observed. Furthermore, when the neutral formazan ligand [LtBuH] was exposed to silylenes [{PhC(tBuN)2}SiCl] and [LPhSiNMePy], substitution and addition reactions occurred. These discoveries significantly enrich the diversity of formazanate/formazan redox chemistry, opening up new avenues for exploration in this field.

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of Hetero&#8208;Pnictogen Diazonium Analogs Stabilized by Transition Metal Units</title>

Reactions of the mixed dipnictogen complexes [{CpMo(CO)2}2(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8208;PE)] (E=P, As, Sb) with carbon&#8208; and tin&#8208;based electrophiles led to the formation of novel [EPR]+ chains stabilized by two [CpMo(CO)2] units, which can formally be considered as heavier diazonium homologs. Reactivity studies on these unique entities with different NHCs showed the formation of novel, asymmetrically substituted diphosphenes.







Abstract
The reactivity of the mixed dipnictogen complexes [{CpMo(CO)2}2(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8208;PE)] (E=P, As, Sb) towards different group&#8197;14 electrophiles is reported. The resulting library of cationic compounds [{CpMo(CO)2}2(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8208;EPR)]+ (R=Mes (2,4,6&#8208;C6H2Me3), CH3, CPh3, SnMe3) represents formally inorganic diazonium homologs which are stabilized by transition metal units. Modifying the steric and electronic properties of the electrophile drastically impacts the respective P&#8722;R bond lengths and is accompanied by increasing (SnMe3&gt;CPh3&gt;CH3) dynamic behavior in solution. In contrast to the well&#8208;studied organic analogs, the prepared compounds are stable at room temperature. The subsequent reaction of the model substrate [{CpMo(CO)2}2(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8208;P2Me)][OTf] ([OTf]&#8722;=[CF3SO3]&#8722;) with different N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) leads to an addition at the unsubstituted P atom which is also predicted by computational methods. NMR spectroscopy confirms the formation of two isomers sync/gauche&#8208;[{CpMo(CO)2}(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8208;P(NHC)PMe){CpMo(CO)2}][OTf]. X&#8208;ray crystallographic characterization and additional DFT calculations shed light on the spatial arrangement as well as on the possible formation pathways of the isomers.

N&#8208;alkylation of diazo compounds: Value&#8208;added to industry waste diazo compounds using feedstock alcohols under earth&#8208;abundant manganese catalysis.alcoholdehydrogenative couplingdrug intermediateshydrogenkinetic studiesmanganese







Abstract
Sustainable chemical production requires fundamentally new types of catalysts and catalytic technologies. The development of coherent and robust catalytic systems based on earth&#8208;abundant transition metals is essential, but highly challenging. Herein, we systematically explored a general hydrogenative cleavage/N&#8208;alkylation tandem of cyclic and acyclic diazo (N=N) compounds to value&#8208;added amines under manganese catalysis. The reaction is catalyzed by a single&#8208;site molecular manganese complex and proceeds via tandem dehydrogenation, transfer hydrogenation, and borrowing hydrogenation strategies. Interestingly, the reaction involves abundantly available renewable feedstocks, such as alcohols, that can act as (transfer)hydrogenating and alkylating agents. The synthetic application of our approach in large&#8208;scale pharmaceutical synthesis and easy access to highly demanding N&#8208;CH3/CD3 derivatives are also demonstrated. Kinetic studies show that the reaction rate depends on the concentration of alcohol and Mn&#8208;catalyst and follows fractional orders. Several selective bond activation/formation reactions occur sequentially via amine&#8211;amide metal&#8208;ligand cooperation.

Under mild conditions: A redox&#8208;neutral and base&#8208;free protocol for the directed ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H aminocarbonylation is developed through high&#8208;throughput experimentation. The mild conditions allowed the introduction of privileged amide moieties to a wide range of anilides bearing various substitution patterns and different weakly Lewis basic directing groups.







Abstract
Introducing amide functional groups under mild conditions has growing importance owing to the prevalence of such moiety in biologically active molecules. Herein, we disclose a mild protocol for the directed ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H aminocarbonylation with isocyanates as the amidating agents developed through high&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE). The redox&#8208;neutral and base&#8208;free reaction is guided by weakly Lewis basic functional groups, including anilides, lactams and carbamates to access anthranilamide derivatives. The synthetic utility of this transformation is reflected by large&#8208;scale synthesis and late&#8208;stage functionalization.

         <title>Highly Enantioselective Synthesis of Pharmaceuticals at Chiral&#8208;Encoded Metal Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 61, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanostructured mesoporous Pt&#8208;Ir alloys are used as heterogeneous catalysts for the asymmetric synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds, illustrated by the enantioselective hydrogenation adrenalone, leading to the desired epinephrine stereoisomer as a model compound with up to 95&#8201;% ee.







Abstract
Enantioselective catalysis is of crucial importance in modern chemistry and pharmaceutical science. Although various concepts have been used for the development of enantioselective catalysts to obtain highly pure chiral compounds, most of them are based on homogeneous catalytic systems. Recently, we successfully developed nanostructured metal layers imprinted with chiral information, which were applied as electrocatalysts for the enantioselective synthesis of chiral model compounds. However, so far such materials have not been employed as heterogeneous catalysts for the enantioselective synthesis of real pharmaceutical products. In this contribution, we report the asymmetric synthesis of chiral pharmaceuticals (CPs) with chiral imprinted Pt&#8722;Ir surfaces as a simple hydrogenation catalyst. By fine&#8208;tuning the experimental parameters, a very high enantioselectivity (up to 95&#8201;% enantiomeric excess) with good catalyst stability can be achieved. The designed materials were also successfully used as catalytically active stationary phases for the continuous asymmetric flow synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds. This illustrates the possibility of producing real chiral pharmaceuticals at such nanostructured metal surfaces for the first time.

         <title>A Photo&#8208;degradable Crosslinker for the Development of Light&#8208;responsive Protocell Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 61, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photocleavable, poly(ethylene) glycol&#8208;based crosslinker, reactive to biological nucleophiles is synthesized and used to covalently stabilise proteinosome membranes. The crosslinker effectively degrades on irradiation with UV light, allowing for the photopatterning of populations of proteinosomes using a 405&#8197;nm laser, and for the controlled formation of membrane pores and the consequent controlled release of macromolecular cargoes based on their molecular weight.







Abstract
The achievement of light&#8208;responsive behaviours is an important target for protocell engineering to allow control of fundamental protocellular processes such as communication via diffusible chemical signals, shape changes or even motility at the flick of a switch. As a step towards this ambitious goal, here we describe the synthesis of a novel poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;based crosslinker, reactive towards nucleophiles, that effectively degrades with UV light (405&#8197;nm). We demonstrate its utility for the fabrication of the first protocell membranes capable of light&#8208;induced disassembly, for the photo&#8208;generation of patterns of protocells, and for the modulation of protocell membrane permeability. Overall, our results not only open up new avenues towards the engineering of spatially organised, communicating networks of protocells, and of micro&#8208;compartmentalised systems for information storage and release, but also have important implications for other research fields such as drug delivery and soft materials chemistry.

         <title>Unprecedented Direct Asymmetric Total Syntheses of 5,8&#8217;&#8208;Naphthylisoquinoline Alkaloids from their Fully Substituted Precursors Employing a Novel Nickel/N,N&#8208;ligand&#8208;Catalyzed Atroposelective Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction</title>

Four different 5,8&#8217;&#8208;coupled naphthylisoquinoline alkaloids have been prepared via a general and concise synthetic pathway directly from the corresponding cross&#8208;coupling reaction precursors. For the cross&#8208;coupling key step, a new Negishi cross&#8208;coupling reaction, employing a Ni/N,N&#8208;ligand&#8208;based catalyst providing the natural products in good yields and high enantiomeric purities, has been developed. Furthermore, we also report on a new approach to the northern 1,8&#8208;dioxynaphthalene building blocks found in the naphthylisoquinoline natural products, utilizing Hartwig's borylation/methylation strategy that allows for the efficient installation of orthogonal protecting groups.







Abstract
A general and concise synthetic pathway for the preparation of four different 5,8&#8217;&#8208;coupled naphthylisoquinoline alkaloids, employing a specially developed nickel/N,N&#8208;ligand&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective Negishi coupling is reported. In the first reported direct atroposelective coupling of the fully substituted precursors, the naturally occurring cross&#8208;coupled products were generally obtained directly in reasonable yields and high enantiomeric purities. For the synthesis of the cross&#8208;coupling precursors, we employed a modification of Bringmann's known approach to the dihydroisoquinoline compounds and a newly developed route for the naphthalene building blocks. For the latter 1,8&#8208;dioxynaphthalene precursors, our strategy utilized Hartwig's borylation/methylation approach and included the efficient installation of orthogonal protecting groups.

         <title>Electroactive Dyes Based on 1,8&#8208;Naphthalimide with Acetylene Linkers as Promising OLED Materials &#8211; the Relationship Between Structure and Photophysical Properties</title>

Appropriate communication is the key to success: four new 1,8&#8208;napthalimide derivatives of acceptor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor type were obtained and thoroughly investigated, paying special attention to photophysical properties. The key element of the structures are the ethynyl linkers, thanks to which perfect &#960;&#8208;electron communication between aromaric building blocks is possible. These luminescence, highly efficient emitters were tested in SM&#8208;OLEDs&#8217; prototypes (DEV1&#8208;DEV4).







Abstract
Four A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type small organic molecules with 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide motifs were successfully synthesised. The designed compounds are built of two 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide units linked via ethynyl &#960;&#8208;linkages with selected functionalised donor motifs i.&#8201;e. 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bithiophene, fluorene, phenothiazine and carbazole derivative. The synthesis based on Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling allowed us to obtain the presented dyes with good yields. The resulting symmetrical small molecules&#8217; optical, electrochemical and thermal properties were thoroughly investigated, and their potential applicability for the OLED devices was demonstrated. In addition, the relationship between molecular structure and properties was considered by employing experimental and theoretical studies. As a result of using various donor groups, it was possible to achieve efficient electroluminescence in the range from green (DEV4) to orange&#8208;red light (DEV3) with a maximum luminance of 3 820&#8197;cd/m2 for DEV4. Upon the insertion of an acetylene linker to the designed molecules, the free rotation of D and A fragments, and hence the effective &#960;&#8208;electron communication within the entire molecule, is possible, which was confirmed by DFT studies. The obtained dyes are characterised by high thermal stability, reversible oxidation&#8208;reduction process, satisfactory optoelectronic properties and good solubility in organic solvents, which is advisable for the application in small molecular organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (SM&#8208;OLEDs) technology.

Intersystem crossing: FRET (40.4&#8197;ps) and CS (1.55&#8197;ns) were observed, upper 3BDP* was populated by charge recombination, followed by the slow intramolecular TTET (14.5&#8197;&#956;s), which generates 3PBI* state, the triplet state formed via the RP ISC shows an unusual ESP phase pattern of (e, e, e, e, e, e), which is a rare example of S&#8208;T+1/T0 states mixing in the RP ISC mechanism.







Abstract
Bodipy (BDP)&#8208;perylenebisimide (PBI) donor&#8211;acceptor dyads/triad were prepared to study the spin&#8211;orbit charge&#8208;transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC). For BDP&#8208;PBI&#8208;3, in which BDP was attached at the imide position of PBI, higher singlet oxygen quantum yield (&#934;&#916;=85&#8201;%) was observed than the bay&#8208;substituted derivative BDP&#8208;PBI&#8208;1 (&#934;&#916;=30&#8201;%). Femtosecond transient absorption spectra indicate slow F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET; 40.4&#8197;ps) and charge separation (CS; 1.55&#8197;ns) in BDP&#8208;PBI&#8208;3, while for BDP&#8208;PBI&#8208;1, CS takes 2.8&#8197;ps. For triad BDP&#8208;PBI&#8208;2, ultrafast FRET (149&#8197;fs) and CS (4.7&#8197;ps) process were observed, the subsequent charge recombination (CR) takes 5.8&#8197;ns and long&#8208;lived 3PBI* (179.8&#8197;&#956;s) state is populated. Nanosecond transient absorption spectra of BDP&#8208;PBI&#8208;3 show that the CR gives upper triplet excited state (3BDP*) and subsequently, via a slow intramolecular triplet energy transfer (14.5&#8197;&#956;s), the 3PBI* state is finally populated, indicating that upper triplet state is involved in SOCT&#8208;ISC. Time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed that both radical pair ISC (RP ISC) and SOCT&#8208;ISC contribute to the ISC. A rare electron spin polarization of (e, e, e, e, e, e) was observed for the triplet state formed via the RP ISC mechanism, due to the S&#8722;T+1/T0 states mixing.

         <title>Synthesis, Structure, and Redox and Optical Properties of 5,10,15,20&#8208;Tetraaryl&#8208;5&#8208;azaporphyrinium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 61, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;templated annulation method is established for the synthesis of 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetraaryl&#8208;5&#8208;monoazaporphyrinium (TAMAP) salts, which exhibit characteristic redox and optical properties reflecting the electronic effects of the meso&#8208;nitrogen atom. The zinc complex of TAMAP salt generated singlet oxygen in quantum yield of 0.77 under irradiation with visible light.







Abstract
The fundamental properties of azaporphyrins can be modulated over a wide range by changing the number of meso&#8208;nitrogen atoms. Reported herein are the first examples of 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetraaryl&#8208;5&#8208;azaporphyrinium (MTAMAP) salts, which were prepared via metal&#8208;templated cyclization of the corresponding zinc(II) and copper(II) complexes of 10&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;chloro&#8208;19&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;5,15&#8208;dimesityl&#8208;10&#8208;azabiladiene&#8208;ac. The inclusion of one meso&#8208;nitrogen atom in the 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetraarylporphyrin skeleton considerably changes the redox and optical properties as well as the degree of aromaticity of the porphyrin ring. The present findings suggest that MTAMAP salts would be promising scaffolds for the development of new azaporphyrin&#8208;based ionic fluorophores and photosensitizers.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Catalytic Hydrogenolysis of Chlorosilanes into Hydrosilanes with &#8220;Inverse&#8221; Frustrated Lewis Pairs
</title>

Hydrosilanes can be synthesized from chlorosilanes and H2, thanks to a combination of a superbase and a borane catalyst, forming an inverse FLP. A mechanistic study demonstrates that the key intermediate species is a highly reactive borohydride, arising from H2 heterolytic splitting.







Abstract
The challenging metal&#8208;free catalytic hydrogenolysis of silyl chlorides to hydrosilanes is unlocked by using an inverse frustrated Lewis pair (FLP), combining a mild Lewis acid (Cy2BCl) and a strong phosphazene base (BTPP) in mild conditions (10&#8197;bar of H2, r.&#8201;t.). In the presence of a stoichiometric amount of the base, the hydrosilanes R3SiH (R=Me, Et, Ph) are generated in moderate to high yields (up to 95&#8201;%) from their chlorinated counterparts. A selective formation of the valuable difunctional monohydride Me2SiHCl is also obtained from Me2SiCl2. A mechanism is proposed based on stoichiometric experiments and DFT calculations; it highlights the critical role of borohydride species generated by the heterolytic splitting of H2.

A highly soluble perylene anti&#8208;bis(4,5&#8208;dialkoxybenzimidazole) bearing branched flexible chains that stabilize a room&#8208;temperature columnar hexagonal phase is reported for the first time. With balanced ambipolar charge carrier mobility, it has a high extinction coefficient, a small optical band gap and a wide absorption range.







Abstract
A new series of highly soluble perylene anti&#8208;bis(4,5&#8208;dialkoxybenzimidazole)s bearing branched flexible chains stabilizing room temperature columnar hexagonal phase and with balanced ambipolar charge carrier mobility is reported for the first time. Only the anti isomer was successfully separated and characterized. These compounds have a high extinction coefficient, small optical band gap and wide absorption range, thus making them a promising class of ambipolar organic semiconductors capable of self&#8208;organizing.

Soluble nonacenes are stabilized via triisopropylsilyl&#8208;ethynylation, halogenation and methoxylation. The substitution resulted in the most stable nonacenes to date. Two derivatives were characterized by crystal structure analysis and one derivative is tested as thin&#8208;film transistor material.







Abstract
Four substituted nonacenes were prepared and characterized by UV&#8208;vis and EPR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography. The compounds are the most stable and soluble nonacenes to date &#8211; due to six strategically placed triisopropylsilyl(TIPS)&#8208;ethynyl groups. They are stable for several weeks in the solid state. In dilute solution their half&#8208;life is 5&#8211;9&#8197;h. Crystal structure analyses of two nonacenes prove their structures. A nonacene derivative was tested in a solution&#8208;processed transistor and exhibits ambipolar charge transport (&#956;e=0.007&#8197;cm2/Vs; &#956;h=0.023&#8197;cm2/Vs).

         <title>Non&#8208;Covalent Supramolecular 1D Alternating Copolymer in Crystal toward 2D Anisotropic Photon Transport</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 61, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 1D non&#8208;covalent supramolecular copolymer is aligned horizontally with the 2D crystal surface because of the angle&#8208;controlled supramolecular synthons. The anisotropic waveguiding ability, &#945;L/&#945;S, is estimated to be 41, which is more than an order of magnitude greater than previously reported 2D platelet crystal waveguides.







Abstract
To realize organic integrated optoelectronic circuits, there is a need for anisotropic optical waveguides at the micro/nanoscale. Anisotropic alignment of one&#8208;dimensional&#8208;ordered supramolecular structures composed of light&#8208;emissive &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules in a crystal may meet the requirements of such waveguides. Here, a bipyridyl&#8208;appended acrylonitrile&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecule was designed, which produced a one&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymer constructed through non&#8208;covalent bonding between a lone pair in bipyridyl and a &#963;&#8208;hole in 1,4&#8208;diiodo&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorobenzene. The one&#8208;dimensional copolymer of bipyridyl and 1,4&#8208;diiodo&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorobenzene is aligned horizontally with the two&#8208;dimensional crystal surface because of the angle&#8208;controlled supramolecular synthons. As a result of control over the non&#8208;covalent bonding direction, anisotropic photoluminescence and photon transport (optical waveguiding) characteristics are realized by orienting the transition dipole moment horizontally with respect to the two&#8208;dimensional surface. Compared with the loss coefficient &#945;L=52&#8197;dB&#8201;cm&#8722;1 for the long&#8208;axis direction of the two&#8208;dimensional platelet cocrystal, a very large difference of &#945;S=2111&#8197;dB&#8201;cm&#8722;1 is present in the crystal short&#8208;axis direction. The anisotropic waveguiding ability, &#945;L/&#945;S, is estimated to be 41, which is more than an order of magnitude greater than previously reported two&#8208;dimensional platelet crystal waveguides. This supramolecular synthon provides an approach to designing anisotropic photon transporters and highly regulated optical logic circuits.

Anisotropic alignment of one-dimensional-ordered supramolecular structures composed of light-emissive &#960;-conjugated molecules in a crystal may meet the requirements of such waveguides.

A jewelry rack represents the square&#8208;lattice of a metal&#8211;organic framework. This is exemplified by a MOF being visible when the jewelry rack is reflected in the table mirror. The earrings on the rack are attached with S&#8722;S hooks that mimic the disulfide bonds used to append functional groups to MOFs in this work. The earrings lacking the S&#8208;hook are left resting on the table, unable to attach to the rack. More information can be found in the Research Article by D.&#8197;T.

Nanostructured mesoporous Pt&#8208;Ir alloys, illustrated by the tunnel entrances, have been successfully developed as heterogeneous catalysts for the asymmetric synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds. These findings, reported by C. Wattanakit, A. Kuhn, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302054), illustrate that these designer materials allow the enantioselective hydrogenation of adrenalone to produce the desired epinephrine stereoisomer with up to 95&#8201;% enantiomeric excess.

         <title>Donor&#8208;Acceptor Activation of Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 61, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cooperative activation of carbon dioxide by donor&#8208;acceptor interactions have become a highly popular strategy whose chemical designs span across the whole periodic table. This perspective categorizes the wide variety of systems reported and assesses their limitations and prospects to develop catalytic functionalization protocols.







Abstract
The activation and functionalization of carbon dioxide entails great interest related to its abundance, low toxicity and associated environmental problems. However, the inertness of CO2 has posed a challenge towards its efficient conversion to added&#8208;value products. In this review we discuss one of the strategies that have been widely used to capture and activate carbon dioxide, namely the use of donor&#8208;acceptor interactions by partnering a Lewis acidic and a Lewis basic fragment. This type of CO2 activation resembles that found in metalloenzymes, whose outstanding performance in catalytically transforming carbon dioxide encourages further bioinspired research. We have divided this review into three general sections based on the nature of the active sites: metal&#8208;free examples (mainly formed by frustrated Lewis pairs), main group&#8208;transition metal combinations, and transition metal heterobimetallic complexes. Overall, we discuss one hundred compounds that cooperatively activate carbon dioxide by donor&#8208;acceptor interactions, revealing a wide range of structural motifs.

         <title>&#8220;Holographic&#8221; Autostereoscopic Displays: A Perspective on Their Technology and Potential Impact in Chemistry</title>

Adding dimensions to chemistry: I explore the potential of &#8220;holographic&#8221; autostereoscopic displays in chemistry research and education. This perspective delves into how this emerging technology could enhance the understanding of complex molecular structures, offering a more immersive and intuitive learning and research experience.







Abstract
The three&#8208;dimensional arrangement of atoms in molecules is essential for understanding their properties and behavior. Traditional 2D representations and digital 3D models presented on 2D media often fall short in conveying the complexity of molecular structures. Autostereoscopic displays, often marketed as &#8220;holographic&#8221; displays, pose a potential solution to this challenge. These displays, with their multi&#8208;view and single&#8208;view configurations, promise to advance chemistry education and research by offering accurate 3D representations with depth and parallax. In this perspective, I delve into the possibilities and limitations of autostereoscopic displays in chemistry, discussing the underlying technology and potential applications, from research to teaching and science communication. Multi&#8208;view autostereoscopic displays excel in facilitating collaborative work by enabling multiple viewers to simultaneously perceive the same 3D structure from different angles. However, they currently suffer from low resolution and high cost, which could limit their immediate widespread adoption. Conversely, single&#8208;view autostereoscopic displays with eye&#8208;tracking, while limited to one viewer at a time, provide higher resolution at a lower cost, thus suggesting that they might become the technology of the future given the balance of price to performance. Despite current limitations, autostereoscopic displays possess undeniable potential for shaping the future of chemistry education and research.

         <dc:description>The photooxidative stability of a series of doubly bridged anthracenes was evaluated after their preparation via twofold macrocyclization of a bis(resorcinyl)anthracene. Lightfastness correlates with the energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), resulting in superior stability of the tetraesters compared to the tetraethers. The lengths and steric demand of the linker only plays a minor role for the ester&#8208;based compounds, which can be prepared in reasonable yields and thus tested in proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. Double ester&#8208;bridging allows deep blue electro&#8208;luminescence, highlighting the importance of the choice of the functional groups used for macrocyclization.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering iron&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H amination with organic azides:&#160;

N2&#160;cleavage from a stable organoazide complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic C&#8211;N bond formation by direct activation of C&#8211;H groups offers wide synthetic potential. En route to C&#8211;H amination, complexes with organic azides are critical precursors towards the reactive nitrene intermediate. Despite their relevance, only&#160;&#945;&#8208;N coordinated organoazide complexes are scarce in general, and elusive with iron, although iron complexes are by far the most active catalysts for C&#8211;H amination with organoazides. Herein, we report the synthesis of a stable iron&#160;&#945;&#8208;N coordinated organoazide complex from Fe(N(SiMe3)2)2&#160;and AdN3&#160;(Ad = 1&#8208;adamantyl) and its crystallographic, IR, NMR and M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopic characterization. These analyses revealed that the organoazide is in fast equilibrium between the free and coordinated state (Keq&#160;= 62). Photo&#8208;crystallography experiments showed gradual dissociation of N2, which imparted an Fe&#8211;N bond length increase and correspond to structural snapshots of the formation of an iron imido/nitrene complex. Reactivity of the organoazide complex in solution showed complete loss of N2, and subsequent formation of a C&#8211;H aminated product via nitrene insertion into a C&#8211;H bond of the N(SiMe3)2&#160;ligand. Monitoring this reaction by&#160;1H NMR spectroscopy indicates the transient formation of the imido/nitrene intermediate, which was supported by zero&#8208;field M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy in frozen solution.</dc:description>

         <title>The Improving Effect of Bromine&#8208;Substitution on Photothermal Performance of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Phototheranostic Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy (PTT) has been widely investigated due to its great application potential in tumor theranostics. PTT is an effective and non&#8208;invasive tumor treatment method that can adapt to tumor hypoxia; nevertheless, simple and effective strategies are still desired to develop new materials with excellent PTT properties to meet the clinical requirements. In this work, we arise a bromine&#8208;substitution strategy to enhance the PTT of A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8217;&#8208;D&#8208;A &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules. The experimental results reveal that bromine&#8208;substitution can notably enhance the absorptivity (&#949;) and photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules, resulting in the brominated molecules generating two&#8208;fold more heat (&#949;808 nm &#215; PCE) compared with the non&#8208;substituted counterpart.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;NIR-II fluorescence imaging-guided photothermal therapy (PTT) has been widely investigated due to its great application potential in tumor theranostics. PTT is an effective and non-invasive tumor treatment method that can adapt to tumor hypoxia; nevertheless, simple and effective strategies are still desired to develop new materials with excellent PTT properties to meet the clinical requirements. In this work, we arise a bromine-substitution strategy to enhance the PTT of A-D-A&#8217;-D-A &#960;-conjugated molecules. The experimental results reveal that bromine-substitution can notably enhance the absorptivity (&#949;) and photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of the &#960;-conjugated molecules, resulting in the brominated molecules generating two-fold more heat (&#949;808 nm &#215; PCE) compared with the non-substituted counterpart. We declare that the enhanced photothermal properties of bromine-substituted &#960;-conjugated molecules are a combined outcome of the heavy-atom effect, enhanced ICT effect, and bromine-mediate more intense intermolecular &#960;-&#960; stacking. Finally, the NIR-II tumor imaging capability and efficient PTT tumor ablation of the brominated &#960;-conjugated materials demonstrate that bromine-substitution will become a promising strategy for developing high-performance NIR-II imaging-guided PTT agents in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Synthesis of Isomeric I&#8208;branched Polylactosamines using Traceless Blocking Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Poly&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl lactosamines (polyLacNAc) are common structural motifs of N&#8208; and O&#8208;linked glycan, glycosphingolipids and human milk oligosaccharides. They can be branched by the addition of &#946;1,6&#8208;linked N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;glucosamine (GlcNAc) moieties to internal galactoside (Gal) residues by the I&#8208;branching enzyme beta&#8208;1,6&#8208;N&#8208;acetylglucosaminyltransferase 2 (GCNT2). I&#8208;branching has been implicated in many biological processes and is also associated with various diseases such as cancer progression. Currently, there is a lack of methods that can install, in a regioselective manner, I&#8208;branches and allows the preparation of isomeric poly&#8208;LacNAc derivatives. Here, we described a chemo&#8208;enzymatic strategy that addresses this deficiency and is based in the enzymatic assembly of an oligo&#8208;LacNAc chain that at specific positions is modified by a GlcNTFA moiety. Replacement of the trifluoroacetyl (TFA) moiety by tert&#8208;butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) gives compounds in which the galactoside at the proximal site is blocked from modification by GCNT2. After elaboration of the antennae, the Boc group can be removed, and the resulting amine acetylated to give natural I&#8208;branched structures. It is also shown that fucosides can function as a traceless blocking group that can provide complementary I&#8208;branched structures from a single precursor. The methodology made it possible to synthesize a library of polyLacNAc chains having various topologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating the Interfacial Charge Density by Constructing a Novel Zn Anode&#8208;Electrolyte Interface for Highly Reversible Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) have attracted considerable attention. However, due to the uneven distribution of charge density at Zn anode|electrolyte interface, severe dendrites and corrosion are generated during cycling. In this work, a facile and scalable strategy to address the above&#8208;mentioned issues has been proposed through regulating the charge density at Zn anode|electrolyte interface. As a proof of concept, amidinothiourea (ATU) with abundant lone&#8208;pair electrons is employed as an interfacial charge modifier for Zn anode|electrolyte interface. The uniform and increased interfacial charge distribution on Zn anode|electrolyte interface has been obtained. Moreover, the unique Zn&#8208;bond constructed between N atoms and Zn2+ as well as the hydrogen bonds are formed among ATU and Ac&#8208; anion/active H2O, which promote the migration and desolvation behavior of Zn2+ at anode|electrolyte interface. Accordingly, at a trace concentration of 0.01 mg mL&#8208;1 ATU, these features endow Zn anode with a long cycling life (more than 800 h), and a high average Columbic efficiency (99.52%) for Zn||Cu batteries. When pairing with I2 cathode, the improved cycling ability (5000 cycles) with capacity retention of 77.9% is achieved. The fundamental understanding on the regulation of charge density at anode|electrolyte interface can facilitate the development of AZIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Computational design of &#945;&#8208;conotoxins to target specific nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are drug targets for neurological diseases and disorders, but selective targeting of the large number of nAChR subtypes is challenging. Marine cone snail &#945;&#8208;conotoxins are potent blockers of nAChRs and some have been engineered to achieve subtype selectivity. This engineering effort would benefit from rapid computational methods able to predict mutational energies, but current approaches typically require high&#8208;resolution experimental structures, which are not widely available for &#945;&#8208;conotoxin complexes. Here, we benchmarked five mutational energy prediction methods using crystallographic and mutational data on two acetylcholine binding protein/&#945;&#8208;conotoxin systems. We developed molecular models for six nAChR subtypes in complex with five &#945;&#8208;conotoxins that were studied through 150 substitutions. We determined that the best method was a combination of FoldX and molecular dynamics simulations, resulting in a predictive Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.68 (85% accuracy). Novel &#945;&#8208;conotoxin mutants designed using this method were successfully validated by experimental assay with improved pharmaceutical properties. This work paves the way for the rapid design of subtype&#8208;specific nAChR ligands and potentially accelerated drug development.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Adhesion of a Pilus&#8208;derived Peptide Involved in Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilm Formation on non&#8208;polar ZnO Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bacterial colonization and biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces are initiated by the adhesion of peptides and proteins. Understanding the adhesion of such peptides and proteins at a molecular level thus represents an important step toward controlling and suppressing biofilm formation on technological and medical materials. This study investigates the molecular adhesion of a pilus&#8208;derived peptide that facilitates biofilm formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a multidrug&#8208;resistant opportunistic pathogen frequently encountered in healthcare settings. Single&#8208;molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) was performed on chemically etched ZnO surfaces to gather insights about peptide adsorption force and its kinetics. Metal&#8208;free click chemistry for the fabrication of peptide&#8208;terminated SMFS cantilevers was performed on amine&#8208;terminated gold cantilevers and verified by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and polarization&#8208;modulated infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (PM&#8208;IRRAS). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and XPS analyses reveal stable topographies and surface chemistries of the substrates that are not affected by SMFS. Rupture events described by the worm&#8208;like chain model (WLC) up to 600 pN were detected for the non&#8208;polar ZnO(11&#8208;20) surfaces. The dissociation barrier energy at zero force &#916;G(0), the transition state distance xb and bound&#8208;unbound dissociation rate at zero force koff(0) for the single crystalline substrate indicate that coordination and hydrogen bonds dominate the peptide/surface interaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Extremely Slow Thermally&#8208;induced Spin Crossover in the Two&#8208;dimensional Network [Fe(bbtr)3](BF4)2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cooling [Fe(bbtr)3](BF4)2 (bbtr=1,4&#8208;di(1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)butane) triggers very slow spin crossover below 80 K (T1/2&#8595; = 76 K). The spin crossover (SCO) is accompanied by a hysteresis loop &#8232;(T1/2&#8593; = 89 K). In contrast to isostructural perchlorate analogue [Fe(bbtr)3](ClO4)2 in which spin crossover during cooling is preceded by phase transition at TPT=126 K in tetrafluoroborate phase transition does not occur to the beginning of spin crossover (80 K). Studies of mixed crystals [Fe(bbtr)3](BF4)2(1&#8208;x)(ClO4)2x (0.5&#8804;x&#8804;0.9) showed that a phase transition precedes spin crossover, however, for x &#8773; 0.46 intersection of T1/2(x) and TPT(x) dependencies takes place. The application of pressure of 1 GPa shifts the spin crossover in [Fe(bbtr)3](BF4)2 to a temperature above 270 K. High&#8208;pressure studies of neat tetrafluoroborate and perchlorate, as well as mixed crystals [Fe(bbtr)3](BF4)2(1&#8208;x)(ClO4)2x (0.1&#8804;x&#8804;0.9), revealed that at 295 K P1/2 value changes linearly with x indicating similar mechanism of spin crossover under elevated pressure in all systems under investigation. Variable pressure single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies confirmed that in contrast to thermally induced spin crossover undergoing differently in tetrafluoroborate and perchlorate an application of high pressure removes this differentiation leading to a similar mechanism depending at first on start spin crossover and then P&#8208;3&#8594;P&#8208;1 phase transition occurs.</dc:description>

         <title>o&#8208;Hydroxyarylphosphanes: Strategies for Syntheses of Configurationally Stable, Electronically and Sterically Tunable Ambiphiles with Multiple Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>o&#8208;Hydroxyarylphosphanes are fascinating compounds by their multiple&#8208;reactivity features, attributed to the ambident hard and soft Lewis&#8208; and also Br&#248;nstedt acid&#8208;base properties, wide tuning opportunities via backbone substituents with &#177;mesomeric and inductive, at P and in o&#8208;position to P and O also steric effects, and in addition, the configurational stability at three&#8208;valent phosphorus. Air sensitivity may be overcome by reversible protection with BH3, but the easy oxidation to P(V)&#8208;compounds may also be used. Since the first reports on the title compounds ca. 50 years ago the multiple reactivity has led to versatile applications. This includes various P&#8208;E&#8208;O and P=C&#8208;O heterocycles, a multitude of O&#8208;substituted derivatives including acyl derivatives for traceless Staudinger couplings of biomolecules with labels or functional substituents, phosphane&#8208;phosphite ligands, which like the o&#8208;phosphanylphenols itself form a range of transition metal complexes and catalysts. Also main group metal complexes and (bi)arylphosphonium&#8208;organocatalysts are derived. Within this review the various strategies for the access of the starting materials are illuminated, including few hints to selected applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Spin&#8208;Vibronic Coupling Controls the Intersystem Crossing of Iodine&#8208;Substituted BODIPY Triplet Chromophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;4&#8208;borata&#8208;3a&#8208;azonia&#8208;4a&#8208;aza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene (BODIPY) dyes are extensively used in various applications of their triplet states, ranging from photoredox catalysis, through triplet sensitization to photodynamic therapy. However, the rational design of BODIPY triplet chromophores by ab initio modelling is limited by their strong interactions of spin, electronic and vibrational dynamics. In particular, spin&#8208;vibronic coupling is often overlooked when estimating intersystem crossing (ISC) rates. In this study, we developed a combined experimental and theoretical approach using spin&#8208;vibronic coupling to correctly describe ISC in BODIPY dyes. For this purpose, we examined seven &#960;&#8208;extended BODIPY derivatives with iodine atoms in different positions. We found that the heavy&#8208;atom effect of iodine atoms is site&#8208;specific, causing high triplet yields in only some positions. This site&#8208;specific ISC was explained by El&#8208;Sayed rules, so both the contribution and character of the molecular orbitals involved in the excitation must be considered when predicting the ISC rates. Overall, the rational design of BODIPY triplet chromophores requires using (i) the high&#8208;quality electronic structure theory, including both static and dynamical correlations, and (ii) the two&#8208;component wave function Hamiltonian, and rationalizing (iii) ISC based on the character of the molecular orbitals of heavy atoms involved in the excitation, expanding El&#8208;Sayed rules beyond their traditional applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A Proof&#8208;of&#8208;Principle Design for Through&#8208;Space Transmission of Unidirectional Rotary Motion by Molecular Photogears</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of molecular photogears that can achieve through&#8208;space transmission of the unidirectional double&#8208;bond rotary motion of light&#8208;driven molecular motors onto a remote single&#8208;bond axis is a formidable challenge in the field of artificial molecular machines. Here, we present a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle design of such photogears that is based on the possibility to use stereogenic substituents to control both the relative stabilities of two helical forms of the photogear and the double&#8208;bond photoisomerization reaction that connects them. The potential of the design is verified by quantum&#8208;chemical modeling through which photogearing is found to be a favorable process compared to free&#8208;standing single&#8208;bond rotation (&#8220;slippage&#8221;). Overall, our study unveils a surprisingly simple approach to realizing unidirectional photogearing.</dc:description>

         <title>Cage Match: Comparing the Anion Binding Ability of Isostructural Versus Isofunctional Pairs of Metal&#8208;Organic Nanocages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Affinities of six anions (mesylate, acetate, trifluoroacetate, p&#8208;toluenecarboxylate, p&#8208;toluenesulfonate, and perfluorooctanoate) for three related Pt2+&#8208;linked porphyrin nanocages were measured to probe the influence of different noncovalent recognition motifs (e.g., hydrogen bonding, electrostatics, &#960; bonding) on anion binding. Two new hosts of M6L312+ (1b) and M4L28+ (2) composition (M = (en)Pt2+, L = (3&#8208;py)4porphyrin) were prepared in a one&#8208;pot synthesis and allowed comparison of hosts that differ in structure while maintaining similar N&#8208;H hydrogen&#8208;bond donor ability. Comparisons of isostructural hosts that differ in hydrogen&#8208;bonding ability were made between 1b and a related M6L312+ nanoprism (1a, M = (tmeda)Pt2+) that lacks N&#8208;H groups. Considerable variation in association constants (K1 = 1.6 x 103 M&#8208;1 to 1.3 x 108 M&#8208;1) and binding mode (exo vs. endo) were found for different host&#8208;guest combinations. Strongest binding was seen between ptoluenecarboxylate and 1b, but surprisingly, association of this guest with 1a was only slightly weaker despite the absence of NH&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;O interactions. The high affinity between p&#8208;toluenecarboxylate and 1a could be turned off by protonation, and this behavior was used to toggle between the binding of this guest and the environmental pollutant perfluorooctanoate, which otherwise has a lower affinity for the host.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Benzene Triimide (BTI) Radical Anions for Probing the Interplay of Unpaired Electron Spin and Chirality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein a series of chiral BTI radical anions bearing different chiral substituents were efficiently prepared by chemical reduction. X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed finely&#8208;tuned packing and helix assemblies of the radicals by the size of chiral substituents in crystalline state. In accordance with the crystalline&#8208;state packing, the powder ESR spectra indicate that 4a&#8211;&#8226;CoCp2+ and 4c&#8211;&#8226;CoCp2+ &#960;&#8208;dimers exhibit thermally excited triplet states arising from strong spin&#8208;spin interactions, while discrete 4b&#8211;&#8226;CoCp2+ shows a broad doublet&#8208;state signal reflecting to weak spin&#8208;spin interactions. The interplay between the unpaired electron spin and chiral substituents was studied by UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR spectra, electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and TD DFT calculations. Different NIR absorptions of the radicals attributing to isolated SOMO&#8594;LUMO+1 (~889 nm) transitions were recorded. The emergence of Cotton effects (CEs) at the NIR region for 4c&#8211;&#8226;CoCp2+ radical enantiomers suggest the interplay between chirality and unpaired electron spin. The origin of the different circularly polarized light absorptions regarding SOMO derived transitions (around 880 nm) was attributed to chiral substitutes regulated electric and magnetic transition dipole moments of the unpaired electron participated transition.</dc:description>

         <title>Unexpected Reduction of a Coordinated Diazapyridinophane Ligand bound to Chromium(III) Ion Leading to Delocalization of the Unpaired Electron across two Isolated Pyridine Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the tetraazamacrocyclic ligand N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,11&#8208;diaza&#8208;[3.3](2,6)pyridinophane (L&#8208;N4Me2), the two pyridine units are separated from each other by sp3&#8208;hybridized triatomic bridges. Such electronically isolated pyridine moieties are considerably less prone to reductions than di&#8208; or triimines. A detailed structural, magnetic, and spectroscopic investigation of the complexes [Cr(L&#8208;N4Me2)(OAc)2] and [Cr(L&#8208;N4Me2)(OAc)2](PF6), in combination with theoretical calculations, reveals that the reduced complex must be described as a chromium(III) ion coordinated to the anionic radical ligand (L&#8208;N4Me2&#8226;)1&#8208; rather than a low&#8208;spin chromium(II) ion bound to closed&#8208;shell ligands. Thus, it is, to the best of our knowledge, only the second example of a stable and structurally characterized metal complex containing a reduced isolated pyridine unit. The stability is attributed to the delocalization of the unpaired electron across the two pyridine units, mediated by their interaction to the metal ion.</dc:description>

The stability is attributed to the delocalization of the unpaired electron across the two pyridine units, mediated by their interaction to the metal ion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Altering the Localization of an Unpaired Spin in a Formal Ni(V) Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The participation of both ligand and the metal center in the redox events has been recognized as one of the ways to attain the formal high valent complexes for the late 3d metals, such as Ni and Cu. Such an approach has been employed successfully to stabilize a Ni(III) bisphenoxyl diradical species in which there exist an equilibrium between the ligand and the Ni localized resultant spin. The present work however broadens the scope of the previously reported three oxidized equivalent species by conveying the approaches that tend to affect the reported equilibrium in CH3CN at 233 K. Various spectroscopic characterization revealed that employing exogenous N&#8208;donor ligands like 1&#8208;methyl imidazole and pyridine favors the formation of the Ni centered localized spin though axial binding. In contrast, due to its steric hinderance, quinoline favors an exclusive ligand localized radical species. DFT studies shed light on the novel intermediates' complex electronic structure. Further, the three oxidized equivalent species with the Ni centered spin was examined for its hydrogen atom abstraction ability stressing their key role in alike reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorescent Phenotyping of Blood Cells Using a Differential Sensing Strategy: Differentiating Physiological Aging Stages and Neuro&#8208;degenerative Disease Drugs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Blood continually contributes to the maintenance of homeostasis of the body and contains information regarding the health state of an individual. However, current hematological analyses predominantly rely on a limited number of CD markers and morphological analysis. Here, we introduce differentially sensitive fluorescent compounds based on TCF scaffolds designed for fluorescent phenotyping of blood. Depending on their structures, TCF compounds displayed varied responses to reactive oxygen species, biothiols, redox&#8208;related biomolecules, and hemoglobin, which are the primary influential factors within blood. Contrary to conventional CD marker&#8208;based analysis, this unbiased fluorescent phenotyping method produces diverse fingerprints of the health state. We successfully demonstrated precise discrimination of blood samples from 37 mice based on their developmental stages, ranging from 10 to 19 weeks of age. Additionally, our fluorescent phenotyping method enabled the differentiation between drugs with distinct targets, serving as a simple yet potent tool for pharmacological analysis to understand the mode of action of various drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Easy to Use DFT Approach for Computational pKa Determination of Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In pKa computational determination, the challenge in exploring and fostering new methodologies and approaches goes in parallel with the amelioration of computational performances. In this paper a &#8220;ready to use methodology&#8221; has been compared to other strategies, such as the re&#8208;shaping in solvation cavity (Bondi radius re&#8208;shaping), wanting to assess its reliability in predicting the pKa of a broad list of carboxylic acids. Thus, the functionals B3LYP and CAM&#8208;B3LYP have been selected, using SMD as continuum solvation model. Exploiting our previous results, two water molecules were made explicit on the reaction centre. Data show that our model (CAM&#8208;B3LYP/2H2O) is capable to accurately predict pKa, leading to mean absolute error (MAE) values lower than 0.5. Noteworthy, good results were achieved in computing the pKa of substituents bearing nitro and cyano groups. Focusing on B3LYP, eventually remarkable outputs were obtained only when Bondi correction was applied to the complex with two water molecules. Hence, massive outcomes were obtained in foreseeing the trichloro and trifluoro acetic acid pKa. These findings demonstrated that no complex level of theory nor external factor are required to accurately predict carboxylic acids pKa, with MAE well below 0.5 units.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing the Origin of Fast Delayed Fluorescence in a Donor Functionalized Bisterpyridine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new carbazole&#8208;substituted bisterpyridine with pronounced delayed fluorescence is presented. While the molecular donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor design suggests the origin of this to be thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), results from various photophysical characterizations, OLED characteristics, temperature&#8208;dependent NMR spectroscopy, and DFT calculations all point against the involvement of triplet states. The molecule exhibits blue emission at about 440 nm with two or more fast decay channels in the lower nanosecond range in both solution and thin films. The delayed emission is proposed to be caused by rotational vibrational modes. We suggest that these results are generally applicable, especially for more complex molecules, and should be considered as alternative or competitive emissive relaxation pathways in the field of organic light emitting materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescent Chiral Furanol&#8208;PAHs via Straightforward Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Csp2&#8208;F Functionalization: Mechanistic Insights into the Scholl Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report the stepwise synthesis of new nanographes (NGs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) obtained via Scholl ring fusion applied at aromatic homologation compounds, which are obtained through one&#8208;step Ni&#8208;catalysed Csp2&#8208;F functionalization.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Here we report the stepwise synthesis of new nanographes (NGs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) obtained via Scholl ring fusion applied at aromatic homologation compounds, which are obtained through one-step Ni-catalysed Csp2-F functionalization. The latter are rapidly accessed valid precursors for the Scholl reaction, and screening of experimental conditions allowed us to describe for the first time furanol-bearing PAHs. Mechanistic insights are obtained by DFT to rationalize the formation of the furanol PAHs under moderately acidic conditions.

         <title>Direct synthesis of N&#8208;formamides by integrating reductive amination of ketones and aldehydes with CO2 fixation in a metal&#8208;organic framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Formamides are important feedstocks for the manufacture of many fine chemicals. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art synthesis of formamides relies on the use of an excess amount of reagents, giving copious waste and thus poor atom&#8208;economy. Here, we report the first example of direct synthesis of N&#8208;formamides by coupling two challenging reactions, namely reductive amination of carbonyl compounds, particularly biomass&#8208;derived aldehydes and ketones, and fixation of CO2 in the presence of H2 over a metal&#8208;organic framework supported ruthenium catalyst, Ru/MFM&#8208;300(Cr). Highly selective production of N&#8208;formamides has been observed for a wide range of carbonyl compounds. Synchrotron X&#8208;ray powder diffraction reveals the presence of strong host&#8208;guest binding interactions via hydrogen bonding and parallel&#8208;displaced &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions between the catalyst and adsorbed substrates facilitating the activation of substrates and promoting selectivity to formamides. The use of multifunctional porous catalysts to integrate CO2 utilisation in the synthesis of formamide products will have a significant impact in the sustainable synthesis of feedstock chemicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Lanthanide Mimicking by Magnesium for Oxazolidinone Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the last decade, magnesium complexes have emerged as a viable alternative to transition&#8208;metal catalysts for the hydrofunctionalization of unsaturated bonds. However, their potential for advanced catalytic reactions has not been thoroughly investigated. To address this gap, we have developed a novel magnesium amide compound (3) using a PNP framework that is both bulky and flexible. Our research demonstrates that compound 3 can effectively catalyze the synthesis of biologically significant oxazolidinone derivatives. This synthesis involves a tandem reaction of hydroalkoxylation and cyclohydroamination of isocyanate using propargyl alcohol. Furthermore, we conducted comprehensive theoretical calculations to gain insights into the reaction mechanism. It is important to note that these types of transformations have not been reported for magnesium and would significantly enhance the catalytic portfolio of the 7th most abundant element.</dc:description>

         <title>A Discotic Star Mesogen with Thymine Nucleobases Exhibiting a Rare Gyroid Cubic Mesophase with 3D Conductivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A unique gyroid cubic phase has been discovered for a discotic star mesogen with three covalently attached DNA bases. In this cubic [[EQUATION]] phase, the conjugated core of the mesogens and the thymine pseudo guests self&#8208;assemble in mirror image continuous networks, representing a semiconducting material with three&#8208;dimensional transport pathways. The hole carrier mobilities are found to be in the typical range of poly(phenylenevinylene) scaffolds.&#160;This structure is stabilized by a weak hydrogen bonding between the thymine bases and can be switched to a columnar liquid crystal &#8211; thermally and by the addition of complementary adenine guests.</dc:description>

         <title>Improving In Vivo Tumor Accumulation and Efficacy of Platinum Antitumor Agents by Electronic Tuning of the Kinetic Lability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The impact of kinetic lability or reactivity on in vitro cytotoxicity, stability in plasma, in vivo tumor and tissue accumulation, and antitumor efficacy of&#160;&#160; platinum(II) (Pt) anticancer agents containing a O&#708;O &#946;&#8208;diketonate leaving ligand remain largely unexplored. To investigate this, we synthesized Pt complexes [(NH3)2Pt(L1&#8208;H)]NO3 and [(DACH)Pt(L1&#8208;H)]NO3&#160; (L1 = 4,4,4&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;1&#8208;ferrocenylbutane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione, DACH = 1R,2R&#8208;cyclohexane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine) containing an electron deficient L1&#8208;H O&#708;O leaving ligand and [(NH3)2Pt(L2&#8208;H)]NO3 and [(DACH)Pt(L2&#8208;H)]NO3 (L2 = 1&#8208;ferrocenylbutane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione) containing an electron&#8208;rich L2&#8208;H O&#708;O leaving ligand. While all four complexes have comparable lipophilicity, the presence of the electron&#8208;withdrawing CF3 group was found to dramatically enhance the reactivity of these complexes toward nucleophilic biomolecules. In vitro cellular assays revealed that the more reactive complexes have higher cellular uptake and higher anticancer potency as compared to their less reactive analogs. But the scenario is opposite in vivo, where the less reactive complex showed improved tissue and tumor accumulation and better anticancer efficacy in mice bearing ovarian xenograft when compared to its more reactive analog. Finally, in addition to demonstrating the profound but contrasting impact of kinetic lability on in vitro and in vivo antitumor potencies, we also described the impact of kinetic lability on the mechanism of action of this class of complexes</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced hydroxyl adsorption in ultrathin NiO/Cr2O3 in&#8208;plane heterostructures for efficient alkaline methanol oxidation reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The exploration of advanced nickel&#8208;based electrocatalysts for alkaline methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) holds immense promise for value&#8208;added organic products coupled with hydrogen production, but still remain challenging. Herein, we construct ultrathin NiO/Cr2O3 in&#8208;plane heterostructures to promote the alkaline MOR process. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that NiO/Cr2O3 in&#8208;plane heterostructures enable a favorable upshift of the d&#8208;band center and enhanced adsorption of hydroxyl species, leading to accelerated generation of active NiO(OH)ads species. Furthermore, ultrathin in&#8208;plane heterostructures endow the catalyst with good charge trcellansfer ability and adsorption behavior of methanol molecules onto catalytic sites, contributing to the improvement of alkaline MOR kinetics. As a result, ultrathin NiO/Cr2O3 in&#8208;plane heterostructures exhibit a remarkable MOR activity with a high current density of 221 mA cm&#8208;2 at 0.6 V vs Ag/AgCl, which is 7.1&#8208;fold larger than that of pure NiO nanosheets and comparable with other highly active catalysts reported so far. This work provides an effectual strategy to optimize the activity of nickel&#8208;based catalysts and highlights the dominate efficacy of ultrathin in&#8208;plane heterostructures in alkaline MOR.</dc:description>

Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that NiO/Cr2O3 in-plane heterostructures enable a favorable upshift of the d-band center and enhanced adsorption of hydroxyl species, leading to accelerated generation of active NiO(OH)ads species. Furthermore, ultrathin in-plane heterostructures endow the catalyst with good charge trcellansfer ability and adsorption behavior of methanol molecules onto catalytic sites, contributing to the improvement of alkaline MOR kinetics. As a result, ultrathin NiO/Cr2O3 in-plane heterostructures exhibit a remarkable MOR activity with a high current density of 221 mA cm-2 at 0.6 V vs Ag/AgCl, which is 7.1-fold larger than that of pure NiO nanosheets and comparable with other highly active catalysts reported so far.

         <title>Field&#8208;assisted Regulation Induced by Cobalt&#8208;Doped ZnO for Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium metal batteries are deemed as an optimal&#160;candidate for the next generation of durable energy storage devices.&#160;However, the&#160;growth of lithium dendrite&#160;and significant&#160;volume expansion pose as&#160;obstacles that impede the application of lithium metal batteries.&#160;Herein, we design a functional&#160;copper&#160;current collector&#160;by coating it with&#160;Co&#8208;doped ZnO (Co/ZnO) to enhance&#160;the lithiophilicity&#160;through local electric fields and&#160;built&#8208;in magnetic fields&#160;induced&#160;by the ferromagnetic material.&#160;The incorporation&#160;of Co not only induces a local electric field and thus accelerates electron transfer, but also imparts&#160;the ferromagnetic behavior to&#160;ZnO,&#160;resulting in an internal magnetic field to regulate the dynamic trajectory.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Lithium metal batteries are deemed as an optimal&#160;candidate for the next generation of durable energy storage devices.&#160;However, the&#160;growth of lithium dendrite&#160;and significant&#160;volume expansion pose as&#160;obstacles that impede the application of lithium metal batteries.&#160;Herein, we design a functional&#160;copper&#160;current collector&#160;by coating it with&#160;Co-doped ZnO (Co/ZnO) to enhance&#160;the lithiophilicity&#160;through local electric fields and&#160;built-in magnetic fields&#160;induced&#160;by the ferromagnetic material.&#160;The incorporation&#160;of Co not only induces a local electric field and thus accelerates electron transfer, but also imparts&#160;the ferromagnetic behavior to&#160;ZnO,&#160;resulting in an internal magnetic field to regulate the dynamic trajectory. Profiting&#160;from&#160;the above advantages, the symmetric cells have excellent cycle stability in 1 mA cm-2&#160;and 1 mAh cm-2, maintaining ultra-low voltage for over 2000 h. This study&#160;provides a realizable pathway for next-generation&#160;current collector of copper&#160;modification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visible Light Activates Coumarin&#8208;Caged mRNA for Cytoplasmic Cap Methylation in Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein synthesis is important and regulated by various mechanisms in the cell. Translation initiation in eukaryotes starts at the 5&#8242; cap and is the most complex of the three phases of mRNA translation. It requires methylation of the N7 position of the terminal guanosine (m7G). The canonical capping occurs in the nucleus, however, cytoplasmic recapping has been discovered. It functions in switching mRNAs between translating and non&#8208;translating states, but the individual steps are difficult to dissect. We targeted cytoplasmic cap methylation as the ultimate step of cytoplasmic recapping. We present an N7G photocaged 5&#8242; cap that can be activated for cytoplasmic methylation by visible light. We report chemical and chemo&#8208;enzymatic synthesis of this 5&#8242; cap with 7&#8208;(diethylamino)&#8208;4&#8208;methyl&#8208;coumarin (DEACM) at the N7G and validate that it is not bound by translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E). We demonstrate incorporation into mRNA, the release of unmethylated cap analogue and enzymatic remethylation to functional cap 0 after irradiation at 450 nm. In cells, irradiation triggers translation of mRNAs with the N7G photocaged 5&#8242; cap via cytoplasmic cap methylation.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Structure and Reactivity of a Mononuclear N,N,O&#8208;Bound Fe(II) &#945;&#8208;Keto&#8208;Acid Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bulky, tridentate phenolate ligand (ImPh2NNOtBu) was used to synthesise the first example of a mononuclear, facial, N,N,O&#8208;bound iron(II) benzoylformate complex, [Fe(ImPh2NNOtBu)(BF)] (2). The X&#8208;ray crystal structure of 2 reveals that the iron centre is pentacoordinate (&#964; = 0.5), with a vacant site located cis to the bidentate BF ligand. The M&#246;ssbauer parameters of 2 are consistent with high&#8208;spin iron(II), and are very close to those reported for &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;bound non&#8208;heme iron enzyme active sites. According to NMR and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopies, the structural integrity of 2 is retained in both coordinating and non&#8208;coordinating solvents. Cyclic voltammetry studies show that the iron centre has a very low oxidation potential and is more prone to electrochemical oxidation than the redox&#8208;active phenolate ligand. Complex 2 reacts with NO to form a S = 3/2 {FeNO}7 adduct in which NO binds directly to the iron centre, according to EPR, UV&#8208;vis, IR spectroscopies and DFT analysis. Upon O2 exposure, 2 undergoes oxidative decarboxylation to form a diiron(III) benzoate complex, [Fe2(ImPh2NNOtBu)2(&#956;2&#8208;OBz)(&#956;2&#8208;OH)2]+ (3). Some hydroxylated ligand was also observed by ESI&#8208;MS, hinting at the formation of a high&#8208;valent iron(IV)&#8208;oxo intermediate. Initial reactivity studies show that 2 is capable of oxygen atom transfer reactivity with O2, converting methyl(p&#8208;tolyl)sulfide to sulfoxide.</dc:description>

         <title>Magnetic Relaxations of Chromium Nitride Porphyrinato Complexes Driven by the Anisotropic g&#8208;factor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecule&#8208;based magnetic materials are useful candidates as the spin qubit due to their long coherence time and high designability. The anisotropy of the g&#8208;values of the metal complexes can be utilized to access the individual spin of the metal complexes, making it possible to achieve the scalable molecular spin qubit. For this goal, it is important to evaluate the effect of g&#8208;value anisotropy on the magnetic relaxation behaviour. We report here the slow magnetic relaxation behaviour of chromium nitride (CrN2+) porphyrinato complex (1), which is structurally and magnetically similar with the vanadyl (VO2+) poprphyrinato complex (2) which is known as the excellent spin qubit. Detailed analyses for vibrational and dynamical magnetism of 1 and 2 revealed that g&#8208;value anisotropy accelerates magnetic relaxations greater than the internal magnetic field from nuclear spin does. Our results provide a design criterion for construction of multiple spin qubit based on g&#8208;tensor engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>CoFe Alloys Dispersed on Se, N Co&#8208;Doped Graphitic Carbon as Efficient Bifunctional Catalysts for Zn&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of a stable and efficient non&#8208;noble metal catalyst with both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is paramount to achieving the widespread application of Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZABs), but remains a great challenge. Herein, a novel Co3Fe7 alloy nanoparticle dispersed on Se, N co&#8208;doped graphitic carbon (denoted as CoFe/Se@CN) was prepared through a facile hydrothermal and pyrolysis process. The synthesized CoFe/Se@CN exhibits outstanding ORR and OER properties with an ultralow potential gap of 0.625 V, which is mainly attributed to the abundant porous structure, the rich structural defects formed by doping Se atoms, and the strong synergistic effects between the CoFe alloys and graphitic carbon nanosheet. Furthermore, the ZAB fabricated by CoFe/Se@CN shows a high peak power density of 160 mW cm&#8208;2 and a large specific capacity of 802 mA h g&#8208;1 with favorable cycling stability, outperforming that of Pt/C+RuO2. Our study offers a plausible strategy to explore bifunctional carbon&#8208;based materials with efficient electrocatalytic properties for rechargeable ZABs.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Triplet&#8208;triplet Annihilation Upconversion of Pyrene Derivatives for Photoredox Catalysis via Molecular Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) has the potential to enhance photoredox catalysis yield. It includes a sensitizer and an annihilator. Efficient and stable annihilators are essential for photoredox catalysis, yet only a few examples are reported. Herein, we designed four novel pyrene annihilators (1, 2, 3 and 4) via introducing aryl&#8208;alkynyl group onto pyrene to systematically modulate their singlet and triplet energies. Coupled with platinum octaethylporphyrin (PtOEP), the TTA&#8208;UC efficiency is enhanced gradually as the number of aryl&#8208;alkynyl group increases. When combining 4 with palladium tetraphenyl&#8208;tetrabenzoporphyrin (PdTPTBP), we achieve the highest red&#8208;to&#8208;green upconversion efficiency (22.4&#177;0.3%) (out of a 50% maximum) so far. Then, this pair is used to activate photooxidation of aryl boronic acid under red light (630 nm), which achieves a great improved reaction yield compared to that activated by green light directly. The result not only provides a design strategy for efficient annihilators, but also shows the advantage of applying TTA&#8208;UC into improving the photoredox catalysis yield.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Starbons&#174;: Methodology Development and Carbon Dioxide Capture Capability.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Five nitrogen sources (glycine, &#946;&#8208;alanine, urea, melamine and nicotinamide) and three heating methods (thermal, monomodal microwave and multimodal microwave) are used to prepare nitrogen&#8208;doped Starbons&#174; derived from starch. The materials are initially produced at 250&#8211;300 oC (SNx300y), then heated in vacuo to 800 oC to produce nitrogen&#8208;doped SNx800y&#8217;s. Melamine gives the highest nitrogen incorporation without destroying the Starbon&#174; pore structure and the microwave heating methods give higher nitrogen incorporations than thermal heating. The carbon dioxide adsorption capacities of the nitrogen&#8208;doped Starbons&#174; determined gravimetrically, in many cases exceed those of S300 and S800. The carbon dioxide, nitrogen and methane adsorption isotherms of the most promising materials are measured volumetrically. Most of the nitrogen&#8208;doped materials show higher carbon dioxide adsorption capacities than S800, but lower methane and nitrogen adsorption capacities. As a result, the nitrogen&#8208;doped Starbons&#174; exhibit significantly enhanced carbon dioxide versus nitrogen and methane versus nitrogen selectivities compared to S800.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Five nitrogen sources (glycine, &#946;-alanine, urea, melamine and nicotinamide) and three heating methods (thermal, monomodal microwave and multimodal microwave) are used to prepare nitrogen-doped Starbons&#174; derived from starch.

         <title>Modifying the catalytic activity of lipopeptide assemblies with nucleobases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biohybrid catalysts that operate in aqueous media are intriguing for systems chemistry. In this paper, we investigate whether control over the self&#8208;assembly of biohybrid catalysts can tune their properties. As a model, we use the catalytic activity of functional hybrid molecules consisting of a catalytic H&#8208;dPro&#8208;Pro&#8208;Glu tripeptide, derivatized with fatty acid and nucleobase moieties. This combination of simple biological components merged the catalytic properties of the peptide with the self&#8208;assembly of the lipid, and the structural ordering of the nucleobases. The biomolecule hybrids self&#8208;assemble in aqueous media into fibrillar assemblies and catalyze the reaction between butanal and nitrostyrene. The interactions between the nucleobases enhanced the order of the supramolecular structures and affected their catalytic activity and stereoselectivity. The results point to the significant control and ordering that nucleobases can provide in the self&#8208;assembly of biologically inspired supramolecular catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Pressure assisted synthesis of highly crystalline 1T&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;LixMoS2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>LixMoS2 is not only discussed as lithium battery material, but is also an important precursor for the synthesis of MoS2 nanomaterials. Current syntheses of MoS2 like in n&#8208;butyllithium / LiBH4 or electrochemically are not satisfying in terms of defined stoichiometry and crystallinity, so an accurate experimental crystal structure determination of this important and widely used material is longingly awaited. A high&#8208;pressure/high&#8208;temperature synthesis yielded highly crystalline 1T&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;LixMoS2 (x = 1, 1.333). 1T&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;LiMoS2 crystallizes in the space group Pwith a = 6.2482(3) &#197;, b = 6.6336(3) &#197;, c = 6.7480(3) &#197;, &#945; = 119.321(2)&#176;, &#946; = 90.010(2)&#176; and &#947; = 90.077(2)&#176;. The arrangement of Mo atoms within the b&#8208;c&#8208;plane confirm a predicted Peierls distortion. A similar atom distribution pattern as for Mo is also observed for the lithium atoms. Calculation of bond valence site energies gave an activation barrier of 1.244 eV for 2D lithium&#8208;ion migration. For x = 1.333, a phase pure synthesis was achieved.</dc:description>
