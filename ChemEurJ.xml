      <dc:description>Several 1,1&#8217;&#8208;diphosphanyl&#8208;substituted metallocenes of magnesium (magnesocenes) were synthesized, structurally characterized, and their reactivity and coordination chemistry were investigated. Transmetalation of these magnesocenes gives access to group 14 metallocenes (tetrelocenes), as well as to stibonocenes. These s&#8208; and p&#8208;block metallocenes represent a novel class of bis(phosphanyl) ligands, exhibiting Lewis&#8208;amphiphilic character. Their coordination chemistry towards different transition metal and maingroup fragments was investigated and different complexes are presented.</dc:description>

      <title>Mo2C/Reduced Graphene Oxide Composites with Enhanced Electrocatalytic Activity and Biocompatibility for Microbial Fuel Cells</title>
      <dc:description>A simple, cost&#8208;effective strategy was developed to effectively improve the electron transfer efficiency as well as the power output of microbial fuel cells (MFCs) by decorating the commercial carbon paper (CP) anode with an advanced Mo  2  C/reduced graphene oxide (Mo  2  C/RGO) composite. Benefiting from the synergistic effects of the superior electrocatalytic activity of Mo  2  C, the high surface area, and prominent conductivity of RGO, the MFC equipped with this Mo  2  C/RGO composite yields a remarkable output power density of 1747&#177;37.6 mW m  &#8208;2  , which is considerably higher than that of carbon paper MFC (CP&#8208;MFC) (926.8&#177;6.3) mW m  &#8208;2  ). Importantly, the composite also facilitates the formation of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) hybrid biofilm and could effectively improve the bacteria&#8211;electrode interaction. These features result in an enhanced coulombic efficiency up 13.2%, nearly one order of magnitude higher than that of the CP (1.2%).</dc:description>

Potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) have become a promising energy storage device for large&#8208;scale energy storage systems. For overcoming the shortages of low initial coulombic efficiency, poor potassium ion reaction kinetics, and volume changes in the PIB system, novel structural design of electrode material (anode and cathode), synthesis methods, ingenious optimization strategies as well as the intrinsic reaction mechanisms have to be considered.

      <title>Halogen Complexes of Anionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
      <dc:description>
Iodine complexes of anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHC) act as electrophiles towards a variety of nucleophiles, with the interactions ranging from noncovalent charge&#8208;transfer or halogen bonding to covalent 3&#8208;center, 4&#8208;electron bonding. Hypervalent (10&#8208;X&#8208;2) bis(carbene)iodine(I) and &#8208;bromine(I) complexes could be isolated and structurally characterized, and computational studies reveal that London dispersion involving the bulky NHC ligands (R=Dipp, Mes) contributes significantly to the stability of these systems.

      <title>Zr&#8208;MOF&#8208;808 as Catalyst for Amide Esterification</title>
      <dc:description>
Amide is one of the most robust groups, characterized by extreme inertness, represented here as laying in a hammock on the beach. Consequently, it will take ages to go up to the mountain together with butanol in the endeavor to get to the other side to become an ester. However, they can take the shortcut of a Zr&#8208;MOF&#8208;808&#8208;P catalyst (FESEM image), represented as a cave, which facilitates reaching the plateau on the other side of the mountain. More information can be found in the Full Paper by P. Garc&#237;a&#8208;Garc&#237;a, A. Corma, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202003752).

      <title>Inversion Symmetry Breaking in Order&#8211;Disorder Transitions of Globular Ligands Coordinating to Cobalt(II) and Nickel(II) Bisacetylacetonato Complexes During Heating</title>
      <dc:description>
Chirality generated by rotational motions: Unexpected inversion&#8208;symmetry breaking was observed in the order&#8211;disorder phase transitions of [M(acac)2(abco)2] (M=Co2+ and Ni2+) during heating. X&#8208;ray structure analysis and differential scanning calorimetry measurements revealed that the 60&#176; step rotating disordering of the globular abco ligands induced local pseudo&#8208;symmetry to increase from trigonal to hexagonal, and the crystal symmetries were lowered to reduce the steric repulsion among them. More information can be found in the Full Paper by N. Hoshino and T. Akutagawa. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202004492).

      <dc:description>
A dual photo&#8208;switch method produces four different hybridization states of duplexes by irradiation with a specific wavelength of light: 465&#8197;nm, 405&#8197;nm, 340&#8197;nm, and 300&#8197;nm. This photo&#8208;regulation system is based on a reversible photo&#8208;crosslinking reaction between two photo&#8208;responsive nucleobases in serinol nucleic acid strands. The use of a different pair of the photo&#8208;responsive nucleobases realizes an orthogonal photo&#8208;control of two duplexes. More information can be found in the Full Paper by Y. Yamano, K.

      <title>A Novel Thermocell System Using Proton Solvation Entropy</title>
      <dc:description>
A large entropy of proton solvation was used for thermoelectric conversion. A [Ru(Him)6] complex produces 3.7&#8197;mV at a temperature difference of 1&#8197;K. This ruthenium complex exhibits a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer reaction and releases protons associated with the redox reaction. Its solvation entropy causes a shift in the redox equilibrium from the temperature difference. More information can be found in the Communication by T. Yamada et&#8197;al.

      <title>A Light&#8208;Harvesting/Charge&#8208;Separation Model with Energy Gradient Made of Assemblies of meta&#8208;Pyridyl Zinc Porphyrins</title>
      <dc:description>
A light&#8208;harvesting antenna model made of three mutually axially coordinated zinc porphyrin molecules is reported in this work. With an energy gradient incorporated, energy transfer only occurs from porphyrin molecules specializing in light absorption to a porphyrin molecule as a charge separation center. The latter molecule is a directly linked porphyrin/ferrocene dyad. The image implies that the light energy is funneled into the lower energy porphyrin/ferrocene dyad with no unfavorable back energy transfer. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J.

      <title>Amorphous Boron Dispersed LaCoO3 with Large Oxygen Vacancies for Efficient Catalytic Propane Oxidation</title>
      <dc:description>Unsatisfied oxygen mobility is a considerable barrier to the development of perovskite for the&#160;low&#8208;temperature volatile organic compounds (VOCs) oxidation. This work introduced small amounts of dispersed non&#8208;metal boron into LaCoO  3  &#160;crystal via an easy sol&#8208;gel method to create more oxygen defects, that are conducive to the catalytic performance of propane (C  3  H  8  ) oxidation. It reveals that moderate addition of boron successfully induces high&#160;distortion of LaCoO  3  &#160;crystal, decreases the perovskite particle size, and produces large proportion of bulk Co  2+  &#160;species corresponding to abundant oxygen vacancies. Besides, surface Co  3+  &#160;species, as the acid sites, that are active for cleaving C&#8208;H bond of C  3  H  8  &#160;molecule are enriched. As a result, the LCB&#8208;7 (molar ratio of Co: B = 0.93: 0.07) displays the best C  3  H  8  &#160;oxidation activity. Simultaneously, the above catalyst exhibits superior thermal stability against CO  2  &#160;and H  2  O for a lasting 200 h. This work provides a new strategy for modifying the catalytic VOCs oxidation performance of perovskites via the regulation&#160;of amorphous boron&#8208;dispersion.</dc:description>

      <title>Multi&#8208;functional, Low Symmetry Pd2L4 Nanocage Libraries</title>
      <dc:description>Although many impressive metallo&#8208;supramolecular architectures have been reported, they tend towards high symmetry structures and avoid extraneous functionality to ensure high&#8208;fidelity in the self&#8208;assembly process. This minimalist approach, however, limits the range of accessible structures and thus their potential applications. Herein is described the synthesis of a family of ditopic ligands wherein the ligand scaffolds are both low symmetry and incorporate exohedral functional moieties. Key to this design is the use of CuAAC chemistry, as the triazole is capable of acting as both a coordinating heterocycle and a tether between the ligand framework and functional unit simultaneously. A common precursor was used to generate ligands with various functionalities, allowing control of electronic properties, whilst maintaining the core structure of the resultant cis&#8208;Pd2L4 nanocage assemblies. The isostructural nature of the scaffold frameworks enabled formation of combinatorial libraries from the self&#8208;assembly of ligand mixtures, generating a statistical mixture of multi&#8208;functional, low symmetry architectures.</dc:description>

      <title>A robust mesoporous Al2O3 based nanocomposite catalyst for abundant NOx storage with rational design of Pt and Ba species</title>
      <dc:description>The nanostructural design of heterogeneous catalysts has often been demanded for assessing synergetic effects, which should be developed further by using high&#8208;surface&#8208;area porous metal oxide supports. However, such opportunities have been robbed by the less stability of ordered mesoporous structure. Herein, we demonstrated rational design to obtain nanocomposite catalysts showing improved NOx storage property due to the presence of Ba species over well&#8208;designed mesoporous alumina (Al  2  O  3  ) support.

All the insights during this synthetic procedure are essential for designing high&#8208;performance catalysts to purify and recover NOx molecules, which is applied for designing a variety of cutting&#8208;edge mesoporous nanocomposite catalysts.</dc:description>

However, its reaction with the pyridine&#8208;based linkers 4,4 &#180; &#8208;bipyridine ( L2 ), 1,2&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethylene ( L3 ) and 1,2&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethyne ( L4 ) allowed the formation of the 2D polymers [{( h 2 &#8208; 1 )Ag} 2 ( &#181; , Lx ) 3 ] n [TEF] 2n ( Lx = L2 ( 5 ), L3 ( 6 ), L4 ( 7 )), respectively. Additionally, this concept was extended to step&#8208;by&#8208;step one&#8208;pot reactions of 1 , [Ag(CH 3 CN) 3 ][Al{OC(CF 3 ) 2 (CCl 3 )} 4 ] ([Ag(CH 3 CN) 3 ][TEF Cl ]) and the linkers L2 &#8208; L4 , producing the 2D polymers [{( h 2 &#8208; 1 )Ag} 2 ( &#181; , Lx ) 3 ] n [TEF Cl ] 2n ( Lx = L2 ( 8 ), L3 ( 9 ), L4 ( 10 )), respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Sensitive and visual detection of phosgene by a TICT&#8208;based BODIPY dye with 8&#8208;(o&#8208;hydroxy)aniline as the active site</title>
      <dc:description>Phosgene and its substitutes (diphosgene and triphosgene) are widely utilized as chemical industrial materials and chemical warfare agents and pose a threat to public health and environmental safety due to their extreme toxicity. Research efforts have been directed to develop selective and sensitive detection methods for phosgene and its substitutes. In this paper, we have prepared two BODIPY&#8208;based fluorescent probes,  o&#8208;Pah and  o&#8208;Pha, which are two isomers with different active sites,  ortho&#8208;aminohydroxy (3',4' or 4',3') phenyls at  meso  position of BODIPY, and compared their sensing performance toward triphosgene. The probe with  o  &#8208;(4'&#8208;amino&#8208;3'&#8208;hydroxyl),  o&#8208;Pha, exhibits better sensing performance over the  o&#8208;(3'&#8208;amino&#8208;4'&#8208;hydroxyl),  o&#8208;Pah, for instance, a lower limit of detection (LOD) (0.34 nM  vs  1.2 nM), and more rapid response (10 s  vs  200 s). Furthermore, based on the above comparative studies, a red&#8208;fluorescence probe  o&#8208;Phae has been constructed through extending 3,5&#8208;conjugation of  o&#8208;Pha. The probe  o&#8208;Phae displays rapid response (60 s), high sensitivity to triphosgene (LOD = 0.88 nM), and high selectivity for triphosgene over relevant analytes including nitric oxide. Finally, a facile test strip for phosgene was fabricated by immobilizing  o&#8208;Phae in a polyethylene oxide membrane for sensitive (&lt; 2&#160;ppm) and selective detection of phosgene in the gas phase.</dc:description>

      <title>HNO to NO Conversion Mechanism via Copper Zinc Superoxide Dismutase (CuZnSOD), Comparison with Heme Protein Mediated Conversions, and Origin of the Questionable Reversibility</title>
      <dc:description>Conversion between NO and HNO via CuZnSOD is important in biomedicine and for HNO detection. Many mechanistic questions, including the decades&#8208;long debate on reversibility, were resolved in this work. Calculations of various active site and full protein models show that the basic mechanism is proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer with the computed barrier of 10.98 kcal/mol in excellent agreement with experiment (10.62 kcal/mol), and this non&#8208;heme protein mediated reaction has many significant mechanistic differences compared to the conversions mediated by heme proteins due to geometric and electronic factors. Reasons for the irreversible nature of this conversion and models with the first thermodynamically favorable and kinetically feasible mechanism for the experimental reverse reaction were discovered.

      <dc:description>A series of in situ&#8208;prepared catalytic systems incorporating Ru(II) precursors and bidentate phosphine ligands has been probed in the reductive carboxylation of ethylene in the presence of triethylsilane as reductant. The catalytic production of propionate and acrylate silyl esters was evidenced by high&#8208;throughput screening (HTS) and implemented in batch reactor techniques. The most promi&#8208;sing catalyst systems identified were made of Ru(H)(Cl)(CO)(PPh3)3 and 1,4&#8208;bis(dicyclohexylphosphino)butane (DCPB) or 1,1&#8217;&#8208;ferrocene&#8208;diyl&#8208;bis(cyclohexylphosphine) (DCPF). A marked influence of water on the acrylate/propionate selectivity was noted.

      <title>Do sulfonamides interact with aromatic rings?</title>
      <dc:description>Aromatic rings form energetically favorable interactions with many polar groups in chemical and biological systems. Recent molecular studies have shown that sulfonamides can chelate metal ions and form hydrogen bonds, however, it is presently not established whether the polar sulfonamide functionality also interacts with aromatic rings. Here we report synthetic, spectroscopic, structural and quantum chemical analyses on 2,6&#8208;diarylbenzenesulfonamides, in which two flanking aromatic rings are positioned close to the central sulfonamide moiety. Fine&#8208;tuning the aromatic character by substituents on the flanking rings leads to linear trends in acidity and proton affinity of sulfonamides. Our physical&#8208;organic chemistry study demonstrates that aromatic rings have a capacity to stabilize sulfonamides  via  through&#8208;space NH&#8211;&#960; interactions. These results have implications in rational drug design targeting electron&#8208;rich aromatic rings in proteins.</dc:description>

Recent molecular studies have shown that sulfonamides can chelate metal ions and form hydrogen bonds, however, it is presently not established whether the polar sulfonamide functionality also interacts with aromatic rings. Here we report synthetic, spectroscopic, structural and quantum chemical analyses on 2,6&#8208;diarylbenzenesulfonamides, in which two flanking aromatic rings are positioned close to the central sulfonamide moiety. Fine&#8208;tuning the aromatic character by substituents on the flanking rings leads to linear trends in acidity and proton affinity of sulfonamides. Our physical&#8208;organic chemistry study demonstrates that aromatic rings have a capacity to stabilize sulfonamides  via  through&#8208;space NH&#8211;&#960; interactions. These results have implications in rational drug design targeting electron&#8208;rich aromatic rings in proteins.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Parallel Lipid Peroxide Accumulation Strategy Based on Bimetal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Ferrotherapy</title>
      <dc:description>Ferroptosis, a nonapoptotic cell death pathway, is commonly regulated by ether lipid peroxide generation or glutathione consumption. In this work, a parallel lipid peroxide accumulation strategy was designed based on catalytic metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) for enhanced ferrotherapy. The bimetallic MOF was synthesized with iron porphyrin as a linker and cupric ion as a metal node, and erastin, a ferroptosis inducer, was sandwiched between MOF layers with 4,4'&#8208;dipyridyl disulphide as spacers. Under tumor microenvironment, erastin was released from the layered MOFs via a glutathione&#8208;responsive cleavage. The exfoliated MOFs served as a dual Fenton reaction inducer to generate numerous hydroxyl radicals for the accumulation of lipid peroxide while erastin aggravated glutathione depletion to down&#8208;regulate glutathione peroxidase 4, which then inhibited the consumption of lipid peroxide. Therefore, a parallel lipid peroxide accumulation strategy was established for enhanced ferrotherapy which effectively inhibited tumor growth in living mice, opening up new opportunities to treat apoptosis&#8208;insensitive tumors.</dc:description>

      <title>Rhodium(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Three&#8208;Component [4+2+1] Cycloaddition of Two Vinylallenes and CO</title>
      <dc:description>Transition metal catalyzed [4+2+1] reactions of diene (or diene derivatives such as vinylallene), alkyne/alkene, and CO (or carbene) are expected to be the most straightforward approach to synthesize challenging seven&#8208;membered ring compounds, but so far only limited successes have been realized. Here we report an unexpected three&#8208;component [4+2+1] reaction between two vinylallenes and CO to give highly functionalized tropone derivatives under mild conditions, where one vinylallene acts as 4C synthon, the other vinylallene as 2C synthon and CO as 1C synthon. We propose that this reaction occurs via oxidative cyclization of diene part of one vinylallene molecule, followed by insertion of terminal alkene part of the allene moiety in another vinylallene, into the Rh&#8208;C bond of five&#8208;membered rhodacycle. Then CO insertions and reductive elimination give the [4+2+1] cycloadduct. Further experimental exploration of why ene&#8208;vinylallenes and CO gave monocyclic tropone derivatives instead of 6/7 products have also been reported here.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of Co3O4/Carbon Heteroaerogels with Ultrahigh Capacitance via Polyethyleneimine&#8208;Intercalation of Co2BIM4 Nanosheets</title>
      <dc:description>The development of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) based supercapacitors have attracted intense concentration in recent years due to their regularly arranged porous and tunable pore sizes. However, the performance of the MOFs derived supercapacitors is also low because of their poor electrical conductivity and rarely accessible active sites. In the present work, we develop a Co&#8208;MOF (namely Co 2  BIM 4  , BIM=benzimidazole) nanosheets derived Co 3  O 4  /nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (Co 2  BIM 4  &#8208;Co 3  O 4  /NC) heteroaerogel as a novel supercapacitor electrode. The 3D Co 2  BIM 4  &#8208;Co 3  O 4  /NC heteroaerogels are obtained by directly intercalating polyethyleneimine (PEI) into the interlayers of Co 2  BIM 4  nanosheets, and following by carbonizing the resulting Co 2  BIM 4  /PEI composite. The Co 2  BIM 4  &#8208;Co 3  O 4  /NC electrode possess 3D conductive framework with an overlapped hetero&#8208;interface and expanded interlayers, leading to fast and stable charge transfer/diffusion and enhanced pseudocapacitance performance. Therefore, the Co 2  BIM 4  &#8208;Co 3  O 4  /NC electrode shows ultrahigh capacitance of 2568&#8201;F&#8201;g &#8722;1  at 1&#8201;A&#8201;g &#8722;1  , 1747&#8201;F&#8201;g &#8722;1  at 10&#8201;A&#8201;g &#8722;1  , and excellent long cycling time with a capacitance preservation of 92.7% following 10000 cycles at 10&#8201;A&#8201;g &#8722;1  , which is very promising for applications in supercapacitors and other energy storage devices.</dc:description>

      <title>The Relationship of William Henry Perkin, Jr. and Sir Robert Robinson: Teacher and Student, then Student and Teacher</title>
      <dc:description>
A productive collaboration: W.&#8197;H. Perkin, Jr. (left) and R. Robinson (right) had perhaps the most productive and broad collaboration between a professor and one's student. Together, during and after Robinson's student days, they had 71 joint publications, 25 of which involved just the two of them, 17 of which involved the structure determination of strychnine, and eight of which were published after Perkin's death in 1929. This Essay examines the professional relationship of Perkin, Jr. and Robinson as revealed in their joint publications on the structure of strychnine.







Abstract
William Henry Perkin, Jr. FRS, the son of the inventor of mauve and other commercial dyes and credited for initiating the industrialization of chemistry, was himself a notable chemist. He was the Professor of Organic Chemistry at Manchester from 1892&#8211;1912 and then was the Waynflete Professor of Chemistry at Oxford and the first Head of the Dyson Perrins Laboratory from 1912&#8211;1929. One of Perkin's graduate students and research assistants at Manchester was Robert Robinson, subsequently Sir Robert Robinson, FRS and recipient of the 1947 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Perkin and Robinson had perhaps the most productive and broad collaboration between a professor and one's student. Together, during and after Robinson's student days, they had 71 joint publications, 25 of which involved just the two of them, 17 of which involved the structure determination of strychnine, and eight of which were published after Perkin's death in 1929. Upon Perkin's early death, Robinson succeeded him as the fourth Waynflete Professor of Chemistry at the Dyson Perrins Laboratory, Oxford University. This Essay will examine the professional relationship of Perkin, Jr. and Robinson as revealed in their joint publications on the structure of strychnine.

      <title>Energetics of Formation of Cyclacenes from 2,3&#8208;Didehydroacenes and Implications for Astrochemistry</title>
      <dc:description>
n&#8208;Acenes (C4n+2H2n+4) are potential carrier candidates for diffuse interstellar bands. Their conversion into n&#8208;cyclacenes (C4nH2n) through UV photon&#8208;initiated dehydrogenation followed by Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition and acetylene expulsion appears energetically plausible. Analysis of the conversion through TAO&#8208;DFT reveals dependency of the energy barriers on ring strains of the primary n&#8208;cyclacene.







Abstract
The carriers of the diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) are still largely unknown although polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, carbon chains, and fullerenes are likely candidates. A recent analysis of the properties of n&#8208;acenes of general formula C4n+2H2n+4 suggested that these could be potential carriers of some DIBs. Dehydrogenation reactions of n&#8208;acenes after absorption of an interstellar UV photon may result in dehydroacenes. Here the reaction energies and barriers for formation of n&#8208;cyclacenes from 2,3&#8208;didehydroacenes (n&#8208;DDA) by intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reaction to dihydro&#8208;etheno&#8208;cyclacenes (n&#8208;DEC) followed by ejection of ethyne by retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reactions are analyzed using thermally assisted occupation density functional theory (TAO&#8208;DFT) for n=10&#8211;20. It is found that the barriers for each of the steps depend on the ring strain of the underlying n&#8208;cyclacene, and that the ring strain of n&#8208;DEC is about 75&#8201;% of that of the corresponding n&#8208;cyclacene. In each case, ethyne extrusion is the step with the highest energy barrier, but these barriers are smaller than CH bond dissociation energies, suggesting that formation of cyclacenes is an energetically conceivable fate of n&#8208;acenes after multiple absorption of UV photons.

It is found that the barriers for each of the steps depend on the ring strain of the underlying &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;cyclacene, and that the ring strain of &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;DEC is about 75&#8201;% of that of the corresponding &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;cyclacene. In each case, ethyne extrusion is the step with the highest energy barrier, but these barriers are smaller than CH bond dissociation energies, suggesting that formation of cyclacenes is an energetically conceivable fate of &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;acenes after multiple absorption of UV photons.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chemical Bonding as a New Avenue for Controlling Excited&#8208;State Properties and Excitation Energy Transfer Processes&#160;in Zinc Phthalocyanine&#8208;Fullerene Dyads</title>
      <dc:description>In this work we employ electronic structure and non&#8208;adiabatic dynamics methods to explore excited&#8208;state properties of covalently bonded zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc)&#8208;fullerene (C60) dyads with 6&#8208;6 [or 5&#8208;6] bonding configuration in which ZnPc is bonded to two carbon atoms shared by the two hexagonal rings [or a pentagonal and a hexagonal ring] in&#160;C60. In both cases, the locally excited (LE) states on ZnPc are spectroscopically bright. However, their different chemical bondings differentiate the electronic interactions between ZnPc and C60. In the 5&#8208;6 bonding configuration the LE states on ZnPc are much higher in energy than the LE states on C60. Thus, the excitation energy transfer from ZnPc to&#160;C60&#160;is thermodynamically favorable. On the other hand, in the 6&#8208;6 bonding configuration such a process is inhibited because the LE states on ZnPc are the lowest ones. More detailed mechanisms are elucidated from non&#8208;adiabatic dynamics simulations. In the 6&#8208;6 bonding configuration, no excitation energy transfer has been observed. In contrast, in the 5&#8208;6 bonding configuration, several LE and charge&#8208;transfer (CT) excitons have been identified to participate in the energy transfer process. Further analysis reveals that the photoinduced energy transfer is mediated by a CT exciton, such that electron and hole transfer processes take place in a concerted but asynchronous manner in the excitation energy transfer. Furthermore, the present work opens up new avenues for regulating excited&#8208;state properties of molecular donor&#8208;acceptor dyads by means of chemical bonding.</dc:description>

      <title>&#960;&#8208;Extended carbazole derivatives as host materials for highly efficient and long&#8208;life green phosphorescent OLEDs</title>
      <dc:description>High&#8208;performance OLEDs that use phosphorescent and/or thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters are capable of realizing 100% electron&#8208;to&#8208;photon conversion. The host materials in these OLEDs play crucial roles in determining OLED performance. Carbazole derivatives are frequently used as host materials, among which 3,3&#8208;di(9 H &#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208; yl)biphenyl ( mCBP ) is often used for lifetime testing in scientific studies. In this study, we expanded the&#160; p &#8208;conjugation of the carbazole unit to enhance OLED lifetime by designing and developing two benzothienocarbazole (BTCz)&#8208;based host materials, namely&#160; m1BTCBP&#160; and&#160; m4BTCBP . Among these host materials,&#160; m1BTCBP&#160; formed a highly efficient Ir(ppy) 3 &#8208;based OLED with an operational luminescence half&#8208;life (LT 50 ) of over 300 h at an initial luminance of approximately 12000 cd m &#8211;2&#160; (current density: 25 mA cm &#8211;2 ). LT 50&#160; at 1000 cd cm &#8208;2&#160; is estimated to be about 23000 h. This performance is clearly greater than that of&#160; mCBP &#8208;based OLEDs (LT 50&#160; = ca. 8500 h).</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis, Structure and Photophysical Properties of a New Class of Inherently Chiral Boron(III) Chelates &#8211; The tert&#8208;Leucine Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>A new family of boron(III) chelates is introduced whereby molecular chirality, confirmed by circular dichroism, is imported during synthesis such that isolation of the diastereoisomers does not require separation procedures. The photophysical properties of two members of the family have been examined: the  N,O,O  &#8208;salicylaldehyde&#8208;based derivative shows pronounced intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer character in fluid solution and is weakly fluorescent, with a large Stokes shift. The corresponding 2&#8208;methylamino&#8208;benzaldehyde&#8208;derived  N,N,O  &#8208;chelate absorbs and fluoresces in the visible region with a much smaller Stokes shift. Orange fluorescence is also observed for this compound as a cast film. Temperature&#8208;dependence studies show that decay of the fluorescent state is weakly activated but emission is less than quantitative at 77K. Quite rare for boron(III)&#8208;based chelates, this derivative undergoes intersystem crossing to form a  meta  &#8208;stable triplet&#8208;excited state.

      <title>Pushing the Limits of Acene Chemistry: The Recent Surge of Large Acenes</title>
      <dc:description>
Ring changes: Rooted in advances in organic synthesis and combined with specialized techniques for generation and study of highly reactive molecules, longer and longer acenes have became accessible for experimental investigations. Combined with sophisticated modern computational chemistry techniques, an encompassing picture of this unusual class of alternant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons emerges.







Abstract
Acenes, consisting of linearly fused benzene rings, are an important fundamental class of organic compounds with various applications. Hexacene is the largest acene that was synthesized and isolated in the 20th century. The next largest member of the acene family, heptacene, was observed in 2007 and since then significant progress in preparing acenes has been reported. Significantly larger acenes, up to undecacene, could be studied by means of low&#8208;temperature matrix isolation spectroscopy with in situ photolytic generation, and up to dodecacene by means of on&#8208;surface synthesis employing innovative precursors and highly defined crystalline metal surfaces under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. The review summarizes recent experimental and theoretical advances in the area of acenes that give a significantly deeper insight into the fundamental properties and nature of the electronic structure of this fascinating class of organic compounds.

      <dc:description>For the first time, the co&#8208;presence in the saponite structure of luminescent Eu(III) and catalytic Nb(V) metal sites was exploited for the simultaneous detection and catalytic abatement of sulfur&#8208;containing blister chemical warfare agents.

      <title>Carbon dioxide capture and utilization with isomeric forms of bis(amino)&#8208;tagged zinc bipyrazolate Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
      <dc:description>Aiming at extending the tagged zinc bipyrazolate Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) family, the ligand 3,3'&#8208;diamino&#8208;4,4'&#8208;bipyrazole (3,3'&#8208;H2L  ) has been synthesized in good yield. The reaction with zinc(II) acetate hydrate led to the related MOF  Zn(3,3'&#8208;L). The compound is isostructural with its mono(amino) analogue Zn(BPZNH2) and with  Zn(3,5&#8208;L), its isomeric parent built with 3,5&#8208;diamino&#8208;4,4'&#8208;bipyrazole.The textural analysis has unveiled its micro&#8208;/mesoporous nature, with&#160; BET area of 463 m2/g. Its CO2  adsorption capacity(17.4 wt.%CO2&#160;at p  CO2  = 1 bar and T = 298 K) and isosteric heat of adsorption (Q  st  = 24.8 kJ mol  &#8208;1) are comparable to that of  Zn(3,5&#8208;L). Both  Zn(3,3'&#8208;L)  and  Zn(3,5&#8208;L)  have been tested as heterogeneous catalysts in the reaction of CO2  with the epoxides epichlorohydrin and epibromohydrin to give the corresponding cyclic carbonates at T=393K and pCO2  =5 bar under solvent&#8208; and co&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free conditions. In general, the conversions recorded are higher than those found for Zn(BPZNH2),proving that the insertion of an extra amino tag in the pores is beneficial for the epoxidation catalysis. The best catalytic match has been observed for the  Zn(3,5&#8208;L)  /epichlorohydrin couple,with 64% conversion and a TOF of 5.3 mmol(carbonate)&#8729;(mmolZn)  &#8208;1&#8729;h&#8208;1.To gain better insights on the MOF&#8208;epoxide interaction, the crystal structure of the [epibromohydrin@Zn(3,3'&#8208;L)] adduct has been solved, confirming the existence of Br&#183;&#183;&#183;(H)&#8208;N non&#8208;bonding interactions. To our knowledge, this study represents the first structural resolution of a [epibromohydrin@MOF] adduct.</dc:description>

      <title>Reactivity of Single Transition Metal Atoms on a Hydroxylated&#160;Amorphous Silica Surface: A Periodic Conceptual DFT Investigation.</title>
      <dc:description>The drive to develop maximal atom&#8208;efficient catalysts coupled to the continuous strive for more sustainable reactions has led to an ever&#8208;increasing interest in single&#8208;atom catalysis. Based on a periodic conceptual Density Functional Theory (cDFT) approach, fundamental insights into the reactivity and adsorption of single late transition metal atoms supported on a fully hydroxylated amorphous silica surface have been acquired. In particular,&#160;this investigation revealed that the influence of van der Waals dispersion forces is especially significant for a silver (98%) or gold (78%) atom, while the oxophilicity of the Group 8&#8208;10 transition metals plays a major role in the interaction strength of these atoms on the non&#8208;reducible SiO2&#160;support. The adsorption energies for the less electronegative row 4 elements (Fe, Co, Ni) ranged from &#8208;1.40 to &#8208;1.92 eV, while for the heavier row 5 and 6 metals, with the exception of Pd, these values are between &#8208;2.20 and &#8208;2.92 eV. Through a systematic analysis of cDFT descriptors determined using three different theoretical schemes, the Fermi weighted density of states approach was identified as the most suitable for describing the reactivity of the studied systems. The contribution of the energy levels to the reactivity is simultaneously scaled based on their position relative to the Fermi level. Finally, the obtained Fermi weighted density of states reactivity trends show a good agreement with the chemical characteristics of the investigated metal atoms as well as the experimental data.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Targeting the interface between DNA quadruplex and duplex regions by small molecules holds significant promise in both therapeutics and nanotechnology. Herein we report on a new pharmacophore that selectively binds with high affinity to quadruplex&#8208;duplex junctions, while presenting a poorer affinity for G&#8208;quadruplex or duplex DNA alone. Ligands complying with the reported pharmacophore exhibit a significant affinity and selectivity for quadruplex&#8208;duplex junctions, including the one observed in the HIV&#8208;1 LTR&#8208;III sequence. The structure of the complex between a quadruplex&#8208;duplex junction with a ligand of this family has been determined by NMR methods. According to these data, the remarkable selectivity of this structural motif for quadruplex&#8208;duplex junctions is achieved through an unprecedented interaction mode so far unexploited in medicinal and biological chemistry: the insertion of a benzylic ammonium moiety into the centre of the partially exposed interfacial G&#8208;tetrad.

      <title>Deciphering the chemical basis of fluorescence of a selenium&#8208;labeled uracil probe when bound at the bacterial ribosomal&#160;A&#8208;site</title>
      <dc:description>We unveil in this work the main factors that govern the turn&#8208;on/off fluorescence of a Se&#8208;modified uracil probe at the ribosomal RNA A&#8208;site. Whereas the constraint into an 'in&#8208;plane'&#160;conformation of the two rings of the fluorophore is the main driver for the observed turn&#8208;on fluorescence emission in the presence of the antibiotics paromomycin, the electrostatics of the environment plays a minor role during the emission process. Our computational strategy clearly indicates that in the absence of paramomycin, the probe prefers conformations that show a dark S1&#160;electronic state with participation of npi* electronic transition contributions between the selenium atom and the pi&#8208;system of the uracil moiety.</dc:description>

      <title>The combined use of gold nanoparticles and infrared radiation enables cytosolic protein delivery</title>
      <dc:description>Cytosolic protein delivery remains elusive. The inability of most proteins to cross the cellular membrane is a huge hurdle. Here we explore the unique photothermal properties of gold nanorods (AuNRs) to trigger cytosolic delivery of proteins. Both partners, protein and AuNRs, are modified with a protease&#8208;resistant cell&#8208;penetrating peptide with nuclear targeting properties to induce internalization. Once internalised, spatiotemporal control of protein release is achieved by near&#8208;infrared laser irradiation in the safe second biological window. Importantly, catalytic amounts of AuNRs are sufficient to trigger cytosolic protein delivery. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that AuNRs with their maximum of absorption in the second biological window are used to deliver proteins into the intracellular space. This strategy represents a powerful tool for the cytosolic delivery of virtually any class of protein.</dc:description>

      <title>Design and Development of Axially Chiral Bis(Naphthofuran) Luminogens as Fluorescent Probe for Cell&#8208;imaging</title>
      <dc:description>Designing chiral AIEgens without any externally tagged AIE active molecules to the chiral scaffold remains a long&#8208;standing challenge to the scientific community. The inherent ACQ phenomenon associated with the axially chiral (R)&#8208;BINOL scaffold, together with the marginal Stokes shift limits their application as chiral AIE active materials. Herein, in our effort to design chiral luminogens, we have come across a design strategy where 2&#8208;phenacyl furans when appropriately fused with the BINOL scaffold will generate solid&#8208;state emissive materials with high thermal and photostability stability as well as color tunable property. The excellent biocompatibility together with high fluorescence quantum yield and large Stokes shift of one of the luminogen stimulated us to investigate its cell&#8208;imaging potential. The luminogen was observed well internalized and uniformly dispersed within the cytoplasm of MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cancer cells with high fluorescence intensity.</dc:description>

      <title>Interaction of Hydrogen with Ceria: Hydroxylation, Reduction, and Hydride Formation on the Surface and in the Bulk</title>
      <dc:description>The&#160; study reports on a first attempt to address the interplay between surface and bulk in hydride formation in ceria (CeO2) by combining experiment, using surface sensitive and bulk sensitive spectroscopic techniques on the two sample systems, i.e., CeO2(111) thin films and CeO2 &#160;powders, and theoretical calculations of CeO2(111) surfaces with oxygen vacancies (Ov) at the surface and in the bulk. We show that, on a stoichiometric CeO2(111) surface, H2 dissociates and forms surface hydroxyls (OH). On the pre&#8208;reduced CeO2&#8208;x samples, both films and powders, hydroxyls and hydrides (Ce&#8208;H) are formed on the surface as well as in the bulk, accompanied by the Ce3+&#171;Ce4+ redox reaction. As the Ov concentration increases, hydroxyl is destabilized and hydride becomes more stable. Surface hydroxyl is more stable than bulk hydroxyl, whereas bulk hydride is more stable than surface hydride. The surface hydride formation is the kinetically&#8208;favorable process at relatively low temperatures, and the resulting surface hydride may diffuse into the bulk region and be stabilized therein. At higher temperatures, surface hydroxyls can react to produce water and create additional oxygen vacancies, increasing its concentration, which controls the H2/CeO2 interaction. The results demonstrate a large diversity of reaction pathways, which have to be taken into account for better understanding of reactivity of ceria&#8208;based catalysts in a hydrogen&#8208;rich atmosphere.</dc:description>

      <title>Sb6O7(SO4)2: A Promising Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Material with an Enhanced SHG Response Activated by Sb(III) Lone Pair Stereoactivity</title>
      <dc:description>Stereochemical activity of lone pairs (SCALP) cation favors the formation of acentric materials and can enhance the second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation (SHG) response and/or the birefringence. Introducing functional Sb(III) into sulfates, an anhydrous sulfate of Sb  6  O  7  (SO  4  )  2  (  1  ), is explored. Sb  3+  cations are in seesaw configurations and in&#8208;phase aligned in a 3D asymmetric dense structure.  1  exhibits an enhanced phase&#8208;matching SHG response, a moderate birefringence, a wide transparency window and considerable environmental stabilities, which endow it a promising UV nonlinear optical (NLO) material. Theoretical studies reveal that the stereoactive lone&#8208;pairs on Sb  3+  cations make the predominant contribution to the SHG effect. This work will engage scientists&#8217; more interest to SCALP&#8208;cation&#8208;based NLO materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Tuning the Molecular Packing of Self&#8208;Assembled Amphiphilic Pt(II) Complexes by Variation of the Hydrophilic Side Chain Length</title>
      <dc:description>Understanding the relationship between molecular design and packing modes constitutes one of the major challenges in self&#8208;assembly and is essential for the preparation of functional materials. Herein, we have achieved high precision control over the supramolecular packing of amphiphilic Pt(II) complexes by systematic variation of the hydrophilic side chain length. A novel approach of general applicability based on complementary X&#8208;ray diffraction and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy has allowed us to establish a clear correlation between molecular features and supramolecular ordering: systematically increasing the side chain length gradually increases the steric demand and reduces the extent of aromatic interactions, inducing a gradual shift in the molecular packing from parallel to a long&#8208;slipped organization. Notably, our findings highlight the necessity of advanced solid&#8208;state NMR techniques to gain structural information for supramolecular systems where single&#8208;crystal growth is not possible. Our work further demonstrates a new molecular design strategy to modulate aromatic interaction strengths and packing arrangements, which may be useful for the engineering of functional materials based on Pt(II) and aromatic molecules.</dc:description>

      <title>A general approach to intermolecular olefin hydroacylation via light induced HAT initiation: an efficient synthesis of long chain aliphatic ketones and functionalized fatty acids</title>
      <dc:description>Herein, an operationally simple, environmentally benign, and effective method for intermolecular radical hydroacylation of unactivated substrates employing photo&#8208;induced hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) initiation is described. The use of commercially available and inexpensive photoinitiators (Ph2CO and NHPI) makes the process attractive. The olefin hydroacylation protocol applies to a wide array of substrates bearing numerous functional groups and many complex structural units. The reaction proves to be scalable (up to 5 g scale). Different functionalized fatty acids, petrochemicals and naturally occurring alkanes are synthesized with this protocol. A radical chain mechanism is implicated for the process.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The functionalization of magnetic nanoparticles has been an important field in the last decade due to the versatile applications in catalysis and biomedicine. Generally, a high degree of functionalities on the surface of the nanoparticles is desired. In this study, covalent functionalization of various aromatic sulfonic acids on carbon&#8208;coated cobalt nanoparticles are investigated on surface functionalization yield and stability. The nanoparticles are prepared  via  covalent linkage of an  in situ  generated diazonium on the graphene&#8208;like surface. Adsorption and wash experiments were performed to confirm a covalent bonding of the naphthalene derivatives on the nanoparticle surface. With an increased number of sulfonic acid groups on the aromatic compound a significantly lower loading is observed on the corresponding functionalized nanoparticles. This can be counteracted by a change of nitrite species. With this method, nanoparticles with a high number of sulfonic acid groups can be produced.</dc:description>

      <title>Donor&#8211;acceptor Stenhouse adducts: Exploring the effects of ionic character</title>
      <dc:description>The effects of solution&#8208;state dielectric and intermolecular interactions on the degree of charge separation provides a route to understand the switching properties and concentration dependence of donor&#8211;acceptor Stenhouse adducts (DASAs). Using solvatochromic analysis of the open form DASA in conjunction with X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and computational theory we analyzed the ionic character of a series of DASAs. First and third generation architectures lead to a higher zwitterionic resonance contribution of the open form and a zwitterionic closed form while second generation architecture poses less charge&#8208;separated open form and neutral closed forms. This can be correlated to equilibrium control and photoswitching solvent compatibility. Due to the high contribution of the zwitterionic resonance form of a first and third generation DASA we demonstrate external control over their switching kinetics by ion concentration, while second generation DASAs are less affected. Importantly, the ionic character of DASAs correlates to the previously observed concentration dependence and is not universal to DASA.</dc:description>

      <title>Cold resistant nitrogen/sulfur dual&#8208;doped graphene fiber supercapacitors with solar&#8208;thermal energy conversion effect</title>
      <dc:description>Though graphene fiber&#8208;based supercapacitors are promising for wearable electronic devices, low energy density of electrodes and poor cold resistance of aqueous electrolytes limit their wide applications in cold environments. Herein, porous nitrogen/sulfur dual&#8208;doped graphene fibers (NS&#8208;GFs) are synthesized via hydrothermal self&#8208;assembly followed by thermal annealing, exhibiting an excellent capacitive performance of 401 F cm&#8208;3 at 400 mA cm&#8208;3 because of the synergistic effect of heteroatom dual&#8208;doping. The assembled symmetric all&#8208;solid&#8208;state supercapacitor with polyvinyl alcohol/H2SO4/graphene oxide gel electrolyte exhibits high capacitance of 221 F cm&#8208;3 and high energy density of 7.7 mWh cm&#8208;3 at 80 mA cm&#8208;3. Interestingly, solar&#8208;thermal energy conversion of the electrolyte with 0.1 wt% graphene oxide extends operating temperature range of the supercapacitor to 0 oC. Furthermore, the photocatalysis effect of the dual&#8208;doped heteroatoms increases the capacitance of NS&#8208;GFs. At an ambient temperature of 0 oC, the capacitance increases from 0 to 182 F cm&#8208;3 under 1&#8208;sun irradiation because of the excellent solar light absorption and efficient solar&#8208;thermal energy conversion of graphene oxide, preventing the aqueous electrolyte from freezing. The flexible supercapacitor exhibits long cycle life, good bending resistance, reliable scalability, and ability to power visual electronics, showing great potentials for outdoor electronics in cold environments.</dc:description>

      <title>Benzo&#8208;Tetrathiafulvalene&#8208; (BTTF&#8208;) Annulated Expanded Porphyrins: Potential Next Generation Multielectron Reservoirs</title>
      <dc:description>Two sterically crowded benzo&#8208;tetrathiafulvalene (BTTF)&#8208;annulated expanded porphyrins (  BTTF7&#8211;F  and  BTTF8  ) have been synthesized. Detailed photophysical investigations revealed their intrinsic intramolecular charge transfer (CT) character, originated from partial electron transfer from electron&#8208;rich TTF units to the relatively electron&#8208;deficient macrocyclic core. This finding stands in contrast to what was observed in the previously reported figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight conformer of BTTF&#8208;annulated [28]hexaphyrin &#160; (  BTTF6  ), where typical &#960;&#8208;&#960; * electronic transition from HOMO to LUMO was observed. However, core expansion in  BTTF7&#8211;F  and  BTTF8  makes the oligopyrrole macrocyclic cores relatively more electron deficient, facilitating the effective intramolecular CT process. Comparative electrochemical investigations revealed that the current generated at the oxidative region is directly proportional to the number of TTF units attached with the macrocyclic core. This work demonstrates the control of intramolecular CT process by incremental addition of TTF units to the macrocyclic core. Facile multielectron electrochemical oxidations of these expanded porphyrins suggest that they behave like potential multielectron reservoirs.</dc:description>

      <title>Concentration&#8208;dependent Self&#8208;assembly of an Unusually Large Hexameric Hydrogen&#8208;bonded Molecular Cage</title>
      <dc:description>The sizes of available self&#8208;assembled hydrogen bond based supramolecular capsules and cages are rather limited.

With a diameter of 2.3 nm and a cavity volume of &#8764; 2800 &#197;3 the assembly is larger than any previously known capsule/cage structures relying exclusively on hydrogen bonds. The self&#8208;assembly process in chlorinated, organic solvents was found to be strongly concentration dependent with the monomeric form prevailing at low concentrations.

      <title>Intermediate valence states in lanthanide compounds</title>
      <dc:description>Over more than 50 years, intermediate valence states in lanthanide compounds have often resulted in unexpected or puzzling spectroscopic and magnetic properties. Such experimental singularities could not be rationalised until new theoretical models involving multiconfigurational electronic ground states and  ab initio  calculations were established. In this minireview, we highlight the different singularities that have been observed among lanthanide complexes, detail the models used to rationalise them and show how such electronic effects may be adjusted depending on energy and symmetry considerations. Understanding and tuning the ground state multiconfigurational behaviour in lanthanide complexes may open new doors to modular and unusual reactivities.</dc:description>
