         <title>Self&#8208;assembly and Lateral Cobalt Coordination of a Fivefold Symmetric Cyanostar Macrocycle on an Au(111) Surface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report the first example of the formation of a close&#8208;packed, regular 2D monolayer of a fivefold symmetric cyanostar macrocycle on an Au(111) surface under ultra&#8208;high vacuum and the structural modification of such self&#8208;assembled architecture upon cobalt atom deposition.








ABSTRACT
The functionalization of solid surfaces with responsive macrocyclic compounds is a key strategy for developing advanced functional materials, with applications in molecular sensing, catalysis, and nanoscale electronics. Here, we report the self&#8208;assembly and lateral cobalt coordination, on an Au(111) surface and under ultra&#8208;high vacuum conditions, of a fivefold symmetric cyanostar macrocycle, a class of anion recognition molecules. This represents the first example of a close&#8208;packed regular assembly of a pentagonal macrocycle at the solid&#8208;vacuum interface.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Coupled J&#8208;Aggregates Synergized With Hydrogen Bonding via Molecular Planarity Engineering for Second Near&#8208;Infrared Imaging and Phototherapy</title>

Abstract
A novel J&#8208;aggregates configuration, termed &#960;&#8211;&#960;&#8208;coupled J&#8208;aggregates, was successfully constructed based on low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight hemicyanine dyes (HCY&#8208;3). Unlike classical J&#8208;aggregates, the &#960;&#8211;&#960;&#8208;coupled J&#8208;aggregates are formed through synergistic &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions between monomeric molecules, The rigidified&#8208; molecular planar architecture not only avoids fluorescence quenching of the photosensitizer but also significantly broadens the bathochromic absorption band owing to enhanced conjugation effects while preserving photodynamic activity. As a result, a broad bathochromic absorption from 600&#160;nm to an absorption tail over 1100&#160;nm was achieved, allowing the photosensitizer to be compatible with a variety of laser sources. The enhanced&#8208;receptor conjugation significantly boosts singlet oxygen generation efficiency while reinforcing &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, endowing the J&#8208;aggregates with exceptional thermal stability, chemical stability, and photothermal generation capability. Under 980&#160;nm laser excitation, the &#960;&#8211;&#960;&#8208;coupled J&#8208;aggregations based on HCY&#8208;3 J&#8208;NPs exhibited excellent ROS generation capacity and NIR&#8208;II fluorescence emission, successfully achieving multimodal photothermal/photodynamic antitumor therapy guided by NIR&#8208;II FL imaging. Such &#960;&#8211;&#960;&#8208;coupled J&#8208;aggregates may represent a new route for the design of NIR&#8208;II photosensitizers.

         <title>Denaturation of Water in Alkaline Melts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vapor pressure measurements and ab initio molecular&#8208;dynamics simulations reveal that in ultra&#8208;alkaline media with base concentrations up to 70&#160;mol L&#8722;1, the activity of water is dramatically reduced by strong bonding interactions. These disrupt traditional hydrogen bonding patterns, alter vapor&#8208;liquid equilibria, and significantly change molecular coordination and proton dynamics.








ABSTRACT
Extremely high base concentrations (cB) in ultra&#8208;alkaline liquids, also known as hydroflux, alter the thermodynamic and structural properties of water. Mixtures of water and alkali (AOH, A&#160;=&#160;Na, K) with molar base ratios of q(A)&#160;=&#160;n(H2O):n(AOH) &#8804; 2:1 (cB &#8805; 25&#160;mol L&#8722;1) show an overproportionally reduced vapor pressure compared to more diluted systems. The vapor pressure of a melt with q(A)&#160;=&#160;0.8 (cB&#160;=&#160;70&#160;mol L&#8722;1) at 200&#176;C is negligible. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations revealed substantial structural reorganization of the hydrogen bonding network in the equimolar mixture of KOH and water. Distinctive molecular features included altered coordination geometries, shortened hydrogen bonds, and frequent proton transfer events, including Grotthuss diffusion, indicative of an altered hydrogen&#8208;bond network and increased proton mobility. Cluster population analysis shows that a significant number of H3O2&#8722; anions are present, which exhibit a near symmetrical hydrogen bond with O&#183;&#183;&#183;H distances &lt;1.28 &#197;. The hydroflux can be seen as an intermediate between an alkaline solution and a molten salt {K+&#183;H+&#183;2OH&#8211;}, in which the water has a vanishing chemical activity.

         <title>Synthesis and Glycosidase Inhibition Studies of Novel Exoglycals Targeting GH3 Family Enzymes: Insights from Comparative Analysis with Macrolide Antibiotics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of structurally diverse exoglycals was synthesized using a modified Julia&#8208;olefination approach from sugar&#8208;derived precursors. These glycosidase transition&#8208;state mimics were further diversified via CuAAC chemistry to yield triazole&#8208;conjugated analogues. Inhibition studies against GH3 &#946;&#8208;glucosidase EryBI revealed competitive inhibition with tunable affinities. Comparative analysis with macrolide antibiotics uncovered distinct inhibition modes, underscoring scaffold&#8208;specific interactions. These findings establish exoglycals as versatile platforms for selective GH3 glycosidase inhibition and therapeutic exploration.








ABSTRACT
Glycosidases are key enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Members of the GH3 family have emerged as therapeutic targets due to their roles in natural product biosynthesis and disease. Transition&#8208;state analogues represent a powerful strategy for glycosidase inhibition, and exoglycals (C&#8208;glycosylidenes) have gained interest as conformational mimics of glycosidic bond hydrolysis.
Herein, we report the synthesis of novel exoglycals bearing diverse substituents, including terminal alkynes and thymidyl residues, via a modified Julia&#8208;olefination strategy from sugar&#8208;derived lactones and substituted sulfones. Selected alkyne&#8208;containing exoglycals were further functionalized through cycloaddition with azidothymidine.
Inhibition studies against EryBI, a GH3 glycosyl hydrolase, were performed. Kinetic analysis revealed diverse inhibitory mechanisms among the exoglycals, displaying competitive inhibition, with Ki values spanning micromolar to millimolar affinities.
To contextualize the inhibitory potential of exoglycals, we evaluated three clinically relevant macrolide antibiotics&#8208;erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin. Intriguingly, these macrolides exhibited competitive or uncompetitive inhibition, contrasting with the consistent competitive behavior of exoglycals. This comparative analysis highlights the scaffold&#8208;dependent selectivity of GH3 inhibition.
Our results demonstrate exoglycals as tunable scaffolds for glycosidase inhibition of GH3 glycosidases and provide mechanistic distinctions between carbohydrate mimics and macrolide antibiotics. These insights could guide the development of next&#8208;generation glycosidase inhibitors with improved specificity.

         <title>Gas&#8208;Phase Synthesis of Hyperbranched UHMWPE by Enhancing Chain Walking and Minimizing Chain Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Compared to conventional solution&#8208;phase polymerization, the gas&#8208;phase method significantly suppresses chain transfer while promoting chain walking, leading to a simultaneous increase in both molecular weight and branching density.








ABSTRACT
A series of rigid&#8208;flexible unsymmetrical bulky &#945;&#8208;diimine palladium catalysts was employed for the gas&#8208;phase polymerization of ethylene, enabling the synthesis of hyperbranched ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE). Compared to conventional solution&#8208;phase polymerization, the gas&#8208;phase method significantly suppresses chain transfer while promoting chain walking, leading to a simultaneous increase in both molecular weight and branching density. Under optimized conditions, the resulting polyethylene exhibited high molecular weight (up to 2053&#160;kg/mol) and branching densities as high as 107 branches per 1000 carbon atoms. Structural characterization confirmed the presence of long&#8208;chain branches and branch&#8208;on&#8208;branch architectures, indicative of a hyperbranched topology. The unsymmetrical palladium catalysts produced polyethylene with higher molecular weight and branching density than the benchmark catalysts, by combining suppressed chain transfer with high chain&#8208;walking ability. This work demonstrates the potential of gas&#8208;phase polymerization as a solvent&#8208;free, environmentally benign route to advanced polyolefin materials with tailored architectures.

         <title>Multiple Conductance States in Artificial Unimolecular Channels</title>

Conformationally self&#8208;tuning macrocycles for observing and modulating subconductance in artificial channels.








ABSTRACT
Since the 1980s, the patch&#8208;clamp technique has revealed subconductance states (substates) in natural ion channels in addition to the traditional closed and fully open states. While subconductance states offer critical insights into the structure and function of ion channels, the structural basis underlying this behavior remains unclear. Artificial ion channels can serve as simplified molecular models to establish structure&#8211;function relationships; however, replicating subconductance behavior is extremely challenging. Here, we present a concept for a conformationally self&#8208;tuning macrocyclic skeleton designed to observe and modulate subconductance states in artificial channels. This concept was experimentally validated using oxacalix[2]arene[2]triazine&#8208;based molecular funnels.

         <title>Front Cover: Moisture&#8208;Enabled Electricity Generation from a Single&#8208;Layer Composite CNT&#8208;Polymer Membrane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 67, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover illustrates the mechanism of moisture&#8208;enabled electricity generation from a single&#8208;layer composite CNT&#8211;polymer membrane. Water molecules are adsorbed on the porous surface, dissociate functional groups, and generate mobile ions (H&#8314;, Na&#8314;). Their directional movement through the CNT percolating networks establishes an electric potential across the membrane, converting ambient moisture into electricity. More information can be found in the Research Article by I. Tzouman, J.&#160;K. Kallitsis and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202502188).

Abstract
The discovery of multi&#8208;principal metal materials has gained enormous interest due to their exceptional properties. The combination of five or more metals in one single phase results in synthesizing a material commonly known as high Entropy material (HEM). These materials have exquisite mechanical and catalytic properties owing to unique metallic combinations. The optical properties of various HEM have recently surfaced with exceptional bandgap tunability ranging from the visible to the infrared wavelength spectrum. These optical properties have attracted material scientists to address the current efficiency bottlenecking from bi&#8208; or tri&#8208;metallic systems. In the quest to deliver efficient performance via High Entropy (HE) configuration, various types of nanostructures are also reported. The major portion of these newly emerged nanostructure categories is comprised of HE&#8208;MXene, HE&#8208;layered hydroxide, and HE&#8208;alloy nanoparticles. Dwelling in these structures for photothermal and photocatalysis are two major interests that have attracted many scientific explorers. There are numerous reviews dedicated to their hardness, toughness, structure, and electrocatalytic properties; a review compiling photo&#8208;stimulated/active properties was missing. This review is dedicated to new classes of HE configuration and their role in photo&#8208;stimulated studies. The major areas of interest are photoabsorbers, photothermal, photodetectors, photoemitters, photocatalysis, and photochromic materials.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Mediated Activation of 1,3&#8208;Dienes and Allenes via Energy Transfers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 67, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nature has inspired chemists to develop photocatalytic processes that harness visible light, offering alternative reaction pathways beyond traditional thermal methods. Energy Transfer (EnT) is a particularly promising strategy, enabling transformations such as isomerization, deracemization, cycloadditions, and cascade reactions. EnT can activate otherwise inert substrates, providing energy&#8208;efficient and atom&#8208;economical routes to complex molecular architectures. This review focuses on recent advances in EnT&#8208;mediated activation of conjugated 1,3&#8208;dienes and allenes, highlighting their synthetic potential and applications in material science.








Abstract
Nature has inspired chemists toward the development of photocatalytic processes. By harvesting visible light, chemists can access alternative reaction pathways that bypass traditional thermal methods. Energy transfer (EnT) stands out for enabling the activation of otherwise inert substrates, generating the corresponding triplet states. This review highlights and compare the recent advances in EnT&#8208;mediated activation of conjugated 1,3&#8208;dienes and allenes (cumulated 1,2&#8208;dienes), which represent an underdeveloped avenue for synthetic purposes. These approaches enable novel transformations, ranging from photoisomerization to challenging cycloaddition. These findings can have broad implications across synthetic chemistry and materials science, offering energy&#8208;efficient and atom&#8208;economical routes to complex molecular architectures. Studies employing indirect functionalization, in which these motifs are not directly activated via EnT, are explicitly excluded from this review.

Helicenes, chiral molecules with helical structures, are promising candidates for circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials. This review summarizes recent advances in red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR CPL&#8208;active helicenes and derivatives achieved through &#960;&#8208;conjugation extension, heteroatom doping (B, N, S), and host&#8211;guest induction. The discussed strategies offer new insights for developing high&#8208;performance NIR chiral luminescent materials.








Abstract
The access to various [n]helicenes holds significant values in synthetic chemistry and materials science due to the unique helically chiral structures and potential applications in chiroptoelectronic materials. Particularly, one of the challenges and current interests as well in this area is to construct new chiral systems that can promise intriguing light&#8208;emitting properties and long&#8208;wavelength circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). In general, the luminescence and CPL spectra have proved to be effectively tuned into the far&#8208;red and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) regions with reasonably high emission quantum efficiency via extension of &#960;&#8208;conjugation or fused&#8208;ring expansion. As the other proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, heteroatom doping of main&#8208;group elements (e.g., O, S, N, B) has also served to enable the precise modulation of molecular electronic structures with reduced HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gaps, leading to the improved performance of NIR CPL. Our minireview offers an overview of rapid progress recently achieved in these emerging chiroptical materials together with extensive discussions on the design strategy and chiroptics both for carbo[n]helicenes and for hetero[n]helicenes, which may provide some new insights into the further pursuit of high&#8208;performance NIR&#8208;active chiral luminescent materials.

Deuterated six&#8208;membered N&#8208;Heteroarenes (6NHetAr) are finding utility in an increasing repertoire of applications. Our paper comprehensively reviews synthetic approaches that have been reported for the deuteration of 6NHetAr and their fused counterparts while providing an overview of established and emerging applications for these materials.








Abstract
Six&#8208;membered N&#8208;heteroarenes (&#8220;6NHetAr&#8221;) play pivotal roles in the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and materials science industries. In recent times, deuterium (D)&#8208;labelled 6NHetAr have demonstrated enhanced performance over their unlabelled counterparts. For example, VV116 and VX&#8208;984, approved therapeutics for the treatment of COVID&#8208;19 and cancer, and deuterated functional materials for use as ligands in catalysts and organometallic light&#8208;emitters. As interest in this field continues to grow, there is a corresponding need to develop more efficient, scalable, and sustainable approaches to deuterate 6NHetAr. In this work, we comprehensively review approaches developed for the incorporation of D into 6NHetAr, their fused counterparts, and complex compounds containing 6NHetAr. We also provide an overview of established and emerging applications for these materials.

         <title>Moisture&#8208;Enabled Electricity Generation from a Single&#8208;Layer Composite CNT&#8208;Polymer Membrane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 67, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work focuses on the development of single&#8208;layer composite membranes containing a hydrophilic polymeric matrix enriched with various types of carbon nanotubes (single&#8208;, double&#8208;, and multi&#8208;walled CNTs), through an environmentally benign process. The membranes hold potential as low&#8208;budget and self&#8208;sustaining energy systems in the field of moisture&#8208;enabled electricity generators (MEGs).








Abstract
Clean and renewable power sources are crucial toward the development of sustainable energy technologies, to address the global energy demand. Moisture&#8208;enabled electricity generators (MEGs) have emerged as promising candidates to harness ambient low&#8208;grade energy stored in the humidity of the atmosphere. In this study, single&#8208;layer composite membranes were developed, consisting of a hydrophilic cross&#8208;linked polymeric matrix of sodium poly(4&#8208;styrene sulfonate&#8208;co&#8208;glycidyl methacrylate) (P(SSNa&#8208;co&#8208;GMA)) and polyacrylic acid (PAA), and incorporating various types of carbon nanotubes (single&#8208;, double&#8208;, and multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes). These composite membranes can spontaneously absorb humidity and display mixed conductivity in a range of relative humidity (RH) environments. The combination of high swelling capacity, hydrophilic surface, and interconnected nanoscale pathways facilitates the formation of a strong ion concentration gradient under humid conditions, leading to higher and more stable voltage output. For example, MEGs based on MWCNTs reaches &#8764;0.65&#160;V. These findings indicate the importance of fine&#8208;tuned morphology and nanotube dispersion in designing efficient MEG devices, as low&#8208;cost and self&#8208;sustaining energy systems.

         <title>Discovery of a Potent Lysine&#8208;Specific Histone Demethylase&#8208;1 (LSD&#8208;1) Inhibitor for Cancer Treatment via Machine Learning, Molecular Modeling, and In Vitro Validation</title>

L01 was identified as a promising LSD1 inhibitor through ML&#8208;based screening, in vitro validation, and molecular modelling. It exhibited antileukemic activity (IC50 = 24&#160;&#181;M), with binding confirmed by MST/SPR and affinity comparable to SP&#8208;2577 in silico. ADMET profiling indicated good permeability and specificity, though further optimisation is required to enhance safety. These findings support L01 as a potential lead compound.








Abstract
The discovery of potent lysine&#8208;specific histone demethylase 1 (LSD&#8208;1) inhibitors is of significant importance in cancer therapy, as LSD&#8208;1 overexpression contributes to tumour progression and malignancy through the regulation of gene expression. We employed an integrated strategy that combined machine learning&#8208;based virtual screening, bioassay validation, and ligand&#8211;target interaction analysis. Virtual screening identified 29 candidate compounds, of which 17 demonstrated micromolar&#8208;level enzymatic inhibition in experimental assays. Among them, compound L01 showed strong potential as an LSD&#8208;1 inhibitor, exhibiting significant antileukemic activity (IC50 = 24&#160;&#181;M) and confirmed binding to LSD&#8208;1 in Kasumi&#8208;1 cells. MST and SPR analysis confirmed the direct binding between L01 and LSD&#8208;1 inferred from our in vitro studies. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations further supported the interaction, revealing a binding affinity of L01 comparable to that of the well&#8208;characterised reversible inhibitor SP&#8208;2577. ADMET analysis revealed that L01 possesses excellent Caco&#8208;2 permeability and high target specificity; however, its moderate drug&#8208;likeness and potential toxicity issues underscore the need for further optimisation. Through computational modelling and experimental validation, our study identifies L01 as a promising LSD&#8208;1 inhibitor with strong potential for optimisation to improve bioavailability and safety in cancer therapy.

         <title>AND&#8208;Gated Multipedal 3D DNA Walker Enables Rapid Dual MicroRNA Imaging and Accurate Cancer Discrimination in Cells and Tissues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 67, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces an AND&#8208;gated multipedal 3D DNA walker (AMTW) for simultaneous imaging of miR&#8208;21 and miR&#8208;155 in living cells and clinical tissues. The AND&#8208;gated design ensures that only the presence of both target miRNAs activates the walker, generating amplified fluorescence signals with accelerated kinetics for highly specific cancer discrimination.








Abstract
Real&#8208;time monitoring of intracellular microRNA expression is crucial for disease diagnosis, yet existing DNA walker&#8208;based detection methods suffer from insufficient specificity and limited reaction efficiency for reliable cancer identification. Herein, we present an AND&#8208;gated multipedal 3D DNA walker (AMTW) for simultaneous imaging of miR&#8208;21 and miR&#8208;155 expression in live cells and clinical tissues. The presence of target miRNAs activates the AND&#8208;gated operation, triggering the walking process and generating amplified fluorescence signals. AMTW achieves a detection limit of 2.79 pM and exhibits higher initial reaction rates than bipedal and monopedal walkers (4.38&#8208;fold and 8.73&#8208;fold increases, respectively). Moreover, the system effectively discriminates between tumor and normal samples at both cellular and tissue levels. Collectively, AMTW advances intracellular miRNA detection by integrating logic&#8208;gated recognition with enhanced collision efficiency, providing a robust platform for precise cancer diagnostics and early disease identification in clinical applications.

AMTW achieves a detection limit of 2.79 pM and exhibits higher initial reaction rates than bipedal and monopedal walkers (4.38-fold and 8.73-fold increases, respectively). Moreover, the system effectively discriminates between tumor and normal samples at both cellular and tissue levels. Collectively, AMTW advances intracellular miRNA detection by integrating logic-gated recognition with enhanced collision efficiency, providing a robust platform for precise cancer diagnostics and early disease identification in clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Binding of Tetrapentylammonium to a c&#8208;MYC G&#8208;quadruplex Depicted through NMR and Volumetric Assessment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 67, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrapentylammonium forms a stable complex with c&#8208;MYC G&#8208;quadruplex, in which the ligand is positioned above the terminal G9&#8208;G13&#8208;G18&#8208;G22 quartet of the host structure and is surrounded by the 3'&#8208;(T23&#8208;A24&#8208;A25) flanking region. The binding proceeds with the release of waters of hydration and a slight decrease in the dynamics of the G&#8208;quadruplex.








Abstract
We recently have demonstrated that, their structural simplicity notwithstanding, tetraalkylammonium (TAA+) ions, i.e., [H(CH2)n]4N+, strongly stabilize the parallel c&#8208;MYC G&#8208;quadruplex while not affecting the thermal stabilities of the antiparallel human telomeric G&#8208;quadruplex or duplex DNA. In the present work, we expand on our discovered paradigm of topology&#8208;selective G&#8208;quadruplex recognition by performing NMR spectroscopic and volumetric characterization of the complex between tetrapentylammonium (TPeA+) and the c&#8208;MYC G&#8208;quadruplex. The binding of TAA+ to the c&#8208;MYC G&#8208;quadruplex is optically silent, which necessitates the use of nonoptical observables, such as density and sound velocity. Our NMR results revealed that TPeA+ forms a stable complex with the c&#8208;MYC G&#8208;quadruplex in which the ligand is positioned above the G9&#8208;G13&#8208;G18&#8208;G22 quartet and is surrounded by the 3&#8242;&#8208;(T23&#8208;A24&#8208;A25) flanking region. We used our densimetric and ultrasonic velocimetric results to calculate changes in volume, &#916;V, and adiabatic compressibility, &#916;KS, accompanying the binding of TPeA+ to the c&#8208;MYC G&#8208;quadruplex. We rationalized these volumetric properties to determine binding&#8208;induced changes in hydration of the associating molecules and the internal dynamics of the host G&#8208;quadruplex. In general, the structural and physico&#8208;chemical insights emerging from this work lay the foundation for further studies of TAA+&#8208;based compounds as a possible starting point for designing topology&#8208;sensitive G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;binding agents.

         <title>Unveiling Intermolecular Frustrated Lewis Pairs in Single&#8208;Molecule Junctions</title>

Scanning tunneling microscopy break junction (STM&#8208;BJ) enables the quantification of FLP formation through distinct conductance attenuation, establishing single&#8208;molecule conductance as an ultrasensitive probe.








Abstract
Intermolecular frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) play vital roles in catalysis yet remain undetectable at the single&#8208;molecule scale due to their ultralow interaction energies and transient nature. This limitation obstructs mechanistic understanding of weak orbital coupling in molecular systems. To address this, we engineered a sterically hindered molecular probe (OPE&#8208;Py&#8208;M) that forms stable in situ FLP adducts with B(C6F5)3 (BCF) within single&#8208;molecule junctions. Using scanning tunneling microscopy break junction (STM&#8208;BJ) techniques, we observed a quantifiable conductance attenuation from 10&#8722;4.39 to 10&#8722;4.78 G0 upon FLP formation, a signature validated by NMR upfield shifts and UV&#8208;Vis charge&#8208;transfer bands. This work establishes single&#8208;molecule conductance as an ultrasensitive probe for orbital perturbations below hydrogen&#8208;bond energy thresholds, enabling unprecedented investigation of noncovalent interactions in molecular electronics and self&#8208;assembly.

         <title>Self&#8208;Contained Calix[3]Acridans with Macrocyclization Induced TADF Property for Highly Selective Recognition of Fe3+ and Detection of Oxidation Degree of Pyrite Medicinal Herbs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 67, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of self&#8208;contained calix[3]acridan (o&#8208;/m&#8208;/p&#8208;AC) were synthesized in this work. The multicolor thermally activated delayed fluorescence properties in the crystalline state were achieved by positional isomerization effects and tunable self&#8208;assembly. In addition, taking advantage of the highly selective recognition of Fe3+ by o&#8208;AC, the detection of the oxidation degree of pyrite&#8208;based medicinal herbs was achieved.








Abstract
In this work, a new synthetic strategy for construction of macrocyclic arenes with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADFMAs) property was developed. Consequently, a series of acceptor&#8208;linked calix[3]acridans (o&#8208;/m&#8208;/p&#8208;AC) with self&#8208;contained structures were synthesized by the template effect and the &#8216;&#8217;2&#160;+&#160;1&#8243; fragment coupling reaction. By utilizing the macrocyclic confinement effect to establish through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) pathways and realize effective donor&#8208;acceptor separation, excellent TADF properties of o&#8208;/m&#8208;/p&#8208;AC in both solution and solid state were achieved. Compared to the monomers, the macrocyclization strategy not only significantly enhanced TADF emission of TADFMAs but also enabled the emergence of TADF property from their originally non&#8208;TADF systems. Moreover, these TADFMAs also exhibited multicolor property through positional isomerization effects and tunable self&#8208;assembly. Especially, o&#8208;AC exhibited highly selective recognition toward Fe3+ in solution with the limit of detection (LOD) concentration of 3.8 &#181;M, which was two orders of magnitude lower than the o&#8208;monomer. Furthermore, the detection of the oxidation degree of pyrite&#8208;based medicinal herbs was achieved. This work represents the pioneering example of TADFMAs in detection, and provides a new insight into the development of organic luminescent materials.

         <title>Multiple Dimerization Modes in Thiocarboxylate Paddlewheel Complexes: A Comprehensive View of Energy Landscapes from DFT Calculations and Statistics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Staggered, square, and heavily bent dimers occur in the five known solvatomorphs of paddlewheel (PW) complex [PtVO(SOCPh)4]. These and other structural motifs are well within energetic reach due to the shallow potential energy surface that guides dimerization and are included in a revised classification of available structural data on heterobimetallic PWs.








ABSTRACT
Thiocarboxylate paddlewheels (PWs) [MTr(SOCR)4L] (M = Pt, Pd; Tr = first&#8208;row transition metal; L = Tr&#8208;coordinated axial ligand) form a variety of dimeric structures via M&#183;&#183;&#183;M' and M&#183;&#183;&#183;S' contacts. We found that [PtVO(SOCPh)4] (1), a molecular spin qubit, yields three crystalline toluene (tol) solvates, namely 1&#183;0.875tol and two polymorphic 1&#183;0.5tol phases. The crystals contain either staggered quasi&#8208;coaxial dimers with short Pt&#183;&#183;&#183;Pt' distances (3.17&#8208;3.23 &#197;) or heavily bent noncoaxial molecular pairs supported by Pt&#183;&#183;&#183;S' contacts (3.34&#8208;3.38 &#197;). By contrast, in the known solvatomorphs 1&#183;CH2Cl2 and 1&#183;0.5hex (hex = n&#8208;hexane), two collinear molecules compose a &#8220;square&#8221; dimer via a pair of reciprocating Pt&#183;&#183;&#183;S' contacts (3.13&#8208;3.16 &#197;). According to gas&#8208;phase DFT calculations (PBE0/def2&#8208;TZVPP/D3BJ), dimerization is energetically favored by 15&#8211;20&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1 and is guided by a shallow potential energy surface, with staggered dimers as ground configurations but eclipsed and square dimers well within energetic reach. Inspection of the local energy minima also disclosed a previously unrecognized eclipsed arrangement with &#8764;45&#176; twisting of both PWs relative to the metal plane, whose existence was confirmed by statistical analysis of PW structures in the Cambridge Structural Database. Our results led to a new classification scheme for these PW dimers relevant to molecular magnetism and quantum technologies.

&lt;p&gt;Thiocarboxylate paddlewheels (PWs) [MTr(SOCR)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;L] (M = Pt, Pd; Tr = first-row transition metal; L = Tr-coordinated axial ligand) form a variety of dimeric structures via M&#183;&#183;&#183;M' and M&#183;&#183;&#183;S' contacts. We found that [PtVO(SOCPh)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), a molecular spin qubit, yields three crystalline toluene (tol) solvates, namely &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#183;0.875tol and two polymorphic &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#183;0.5tol phases. The crystals contain either staggered quasi-coaxial dimers with short Pt&#183;&#183;&#183;Pt' distances (3.17-3.23 &#197;) or heavily bent noncoaxial molecular pairs supported by Pt&#183;&#183;&#183;S' contacts (3.34-3.38 &#197;). By contrast, in the known solvatomorphs &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#183;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#183;0.5hex (hex = &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-hexane), two collinear molecules compose a &#8220;square&#8221; dimer via a pair of reciprocating Pt&#183;&#183;&#183;S' contacts (3.13-3.16 &#197;). According to gas-phase DFT calculations (PBE0/def2-TZVPP/D3BJ), dimerization is energetically favored by 15&#8211;20&#160;kcal mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and is guided by a shallow potential energy surface, with staggered dimers as ground configurations but eclipsed and square dimers well within energetic reach. Inspection of the local energy minima also disclosed a previously unrecognized eclipsed arrangement with &#8764;45&#176; twisting of both PWs relative to the metal plane, whose existence was confirmed by statistical analysis of PW structures in the Cambridge Structural Database. Our results led to a new classification scheme for these PW dimers relevant to molecular magnetism and quantum technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Vanadium(V) Complexes Bearing Bidentate Phenoxy&#8208;Phosphine Ligands and Their High Performance Toward Ethylene Homopolymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel imido&#8208;vanadium catalysts bearing bidentate phenoxy&#8208;phosphine ligands overcome traditional instability, achieving remarkable performance in ethylene polymerization, including ultra&#8208;high activity, excellent thermal stability, broad solvent compatibility, long catalytic lifetime, and Mw&#8208;tunable polyethylenes. By modifying ligand framework, the performance can be effectively tuned, offering a robust design strategy.








ABSTRACT
A new series of imido&#8208;vanadium(V) complexes bearing bidentate phenoxy&#8208;phosphine ligands was synthesized in high yields and fully characterized by NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. These complexes were systematically evaluated as efficient catalysts for ethylene polymerization. Among them, complex C1 exhibited exceptional activity, up to 446.5 &#215; 106 gPE (molV)&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1, along with excellent thermal stability (120&#176;C), long catalytic lifetime (120&#160;min), and broad solvent compatibility. The produced polyethylene samples spanned moderate to ultra&#8208;high molecular weights, with a maximum of 160.4 &#215; 104&#160;Da. Systematic structure&#8208;activity&#8208;polymer investigations revealed that both steric and electronic variations on ligand critically tune catalytic behavior and polymer properties, underscoring the effectiveness of phenoxy&#8208;phosphine framework and providing valuable insights for the rational design of high&#8208;performance polyolefin catalysts.

         <title>Distinct Ligand&#8208; and Metal&#8208;Centered Phosphorescence in a Terbium Carbazolyl Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Terbium and lanthanum carbazolide complexes show two distinct modes of luminescence: Strongly temperature&#8208;dependent narrow&#8208;line terbium emission could be induced. In addition, both the terbium and the lanthanum complexes show broad&#8208;line interligand emission processes with excited states of microsecond life&#8208;time.








ABSTRACT
Carbazolide complexes of lanthanum and terbium with cyclooctatetraenediide (COT) and THF coligands of the type [(dtbpCbz)LnCOT(thf)n] (n = 2 for La, 1 for Tb) were synthesized by salt metathesis reactions. The THF molecules were found to be labile, and drying under vacuum led to their partial removal with concomitant formation of the dinuclear complexes [(dtbpCbz)2Ln2(COT)2(thf)]. The luminescence of both lanthanum and terbium complexes was investigated, and at cryogenic temperatures, strongly temperature&#8208;dependent phosphorescence was observed. The terbium complexes show the expected element&#8208;characteristic emission with narrow lines between 480 and 700&#160;nm upon excitation at 370&#160;nm. Beyond that, broad emission was induced selectively by excitation at lower energy. Related phosphorescence was found for the lanthanum complex, which implies intra&#8208; or inter&#8208;ligand excitation as source for the latter. This interpretation was corroborated by TD&#8208;DFT computations.

         <title>Modified Julia Olefination Approach to Chiral &#945;&#8208;Fluorovinyl Amino Alcohols and Amino Acids, via Fluorovinyl Oxazolidine Precursors, Conformational and Crystallographic Analyses</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral &#945;&#8208;fluorovinyl oxazolidines were synthesized by condensation of Julia reagents, prepared from L &#8208; or D&#8208;serine, and aldehydes. Olefinations were tunable towards E&#8208; or Z&#8208;alkenes. Fluorovinyl E/Z mixtures with electron rich substituents were isomerized to Z&#8208;olefins. Oxazolidines were converted to amino alcohols, and some were oxidized to protected amino acids. X&#8208;ray, NMR data, and DFT computations were used for conformational analyses.








Abstract
Synthesis of chiral &#945;&#8208;fluorovinyl &#946;&#8208;aryl/heteroaryl/alkyl amino alcohols was achieved via intermediate 4&#8208;(&#945;&#8208;fluorovinyl) 2,2&#8208;dimethyloxazolidines with stereochemically defined preexisting stereogenic centers, derived from (S)&#8208; or (R)&#8208;serine. Previously unknown 4&#8208;fluorovinyl 2,2&#8208;dimethyloxazolidines with a fluorine atom placed alpha to the oxazolidine were prepared via Julia olefination of tert&#8208;butyl (S)&#8208;4&#8208;{(S)&#8208;[benzo[d]thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylsulfonyl]fluoromethyl}&#8208;2,2&#8208;dimethyloxazolidine&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylate and its (R,R) enantiomer, with a series of aldehydes. By choice of conditions, olefinations could be tuned towards Z&#8208; or E&#8208;selectivity. E/Z olefin mixtures with electron&#8208;rich aryl and heteroaryl substituents were isomerized exclusively or predominantly to the Z&#8208;isomer. N&#8208;Boc protected &#946;&#8208;aryl/alkyl substituted &#945;&#8208;fluorovinyl amino alcohols were obtained by oxazolidine hydrolysis. To demonstrate utility for synthesis of amino acids, (R,Z)&#8208; and (S,Z)&#8208;p&#8208;methoxyphenyl&#8208; and the (S,E)&#8208;p&#8208;cyanophenyl&#8208;substituted alkenes were subjected to oxidation, which was very challenging. The use of cat. TEMPO/cat. NaOCl/NaClO2 gave the N&#8208;Boc protected fluorovinyl amino acids that were converted to their methyl esters. Enantioselective HPLC of the (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;p&#8208;methoxyphenyl&#8208;substituted products formed at each step of the synthetic sequence indicated that high enantiomeric purity was retained through the entire synthesis. Crystal structures of two fluorovinyl oxazolidines and one amino alcohol provided insight into the solid&#8208;state conformations. NMR and computational analyses were used to obtain insight into plausible solution conformations.

         <title>Stafib&#8208;2&#8208;CR: an Improved Nanomolar and Selective Inhibitor of the Transcription Factor STAT5b Developed by Conformational Restriction of Stafib&#8208;2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conformational restriction strategies to increase the activity and selectivity of the STAT5b inhibitor Stafib&#8208;2 are presented. The best conformationally restricted inhibitor Stafib&#8208;2&#8208;CR has threefold higher activity against STAT5b than Stafib&#8208;2. A cell&#8208;permeable prodrug of Stafib&#8208;2&#8208;CR inhibits phosphorylation of STAT5b in cultured human leukemia cells with higher activity and selectivity than the prodrug corresponding to Stafib&#8208;2.








ABSTRACT
The highly homologous transcription factors STAT5a and STAT5b are overactivated in many human tumor types. We recently reported catechol bisphosphates as the first chemical entities that inhibit STAT5b with selectivity over STAT5a. Here, we apply conformational restriction strategies to increase the activity and selectivity of Stafib&#8208;2, the most potent STAT5b inhibitor reported to date. The best conformationally restricted Stafib&#8208;2 analogue 8b (dubbed Stafib&#8208;2&#8208;CR) displayed approximately threefold higher activity against STAT5b than Stafib&#8208;2, associated with higher selectivity over STAT5a. Its cell&#8208;permeable prodrug 17 (dubbed Pomstafib&#8208;2&#8208;CR) inhibits phosphorylation of STAT5b in cultured human leukemia cells with slightly higher activity and selectivity over STAT5a than Pomstafib&#8208;2, the prodrug corresponding to Stafib&#8208;2.

&lt;p&gt;Conformational restriction strategies to increase the activity and selectivity of the STAT5b inhibitor Stafib-2 are presented. The best conformationally restricted inhibitor Stafib-2-CR has threefold higher activity against STAT5b than Stafib-2.

&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highly homologous transcription factors STAT5a and STAT5b are overactivated in many human tumor types. We recently reported catechol bisphosphates as the first chemical entities that inhibit STAT5b with selectivity over STAT5a. Here, we apply conformational restriction strategies to increase the activity and selectivity of Stafib-2, the most potent STAT5b inhibitor reported to date. The best conformationally restricted Stafib-2 analogue &lt;b&gt;8b&lt;/b&gt; (dubbed Stafib-2-CR) displayed approximately threefold higher activity against STAT5b than Stafib-2, associated with higher selectivity over STAT5a. Its cell-permeable prodrug &lt;b&gt;17&lt;/b&gt; (dubbed Pomstafib-2-CR) inhibits phosphorylation of STAT5b in cultured human leukemia cells with slightly higher activity and selectivity over STAT5a than Pomstafib-2, the prodrug corresponding to Stafib-2.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polymer Size&#8211;Catalytic Activity Relationships in Solution by Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy coupled with chemoselective fluorescent monomers enables catalytic activity characterization of catalysts associated with polymers in solution and determines catalytic persistence. Deviation from an ideal population as assessed by &#967;2 is developed to track changes in the relative number of species and characterizes growing polymers as collections of aggregates.








ABSTRACT
Measuring the catalytic activity of specific sizes of polymers with active catalysts in solution is typically challenging, due to limited instrument detection sensitivity and/or dynamic range. Here, a fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) method is developed to determine the catalytic activity of living polymers of a specific apparent size in solution. Deviation from a single&#8208;component FCS data fitting, as assessed by &#967;2, is also introduced and developed as a &#8220;speciation index&#8221;&#8212;a method to evaluate and track changes in the relative amount of distinct polymer sizes with reaction progress. These methods are enabled by incorporating a selectively reactive fluorescent monomer into growing polydicyclopentadiene or polynorbornene during ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP). Compared to polynorbornene, data showed that catalysts in aggregates of polyDCPD retained higher activity for longer&#8212;outcomes not directly inferable from simple diffusional&#8208;access predictions. The ability to assign catalytic activity to polymers of specific sizes, and then to determine how this activity evolves with reaction progress, support long&#8208;term goals in the development and measurement of nano&#8208;objects that possess size&#8208;dependent catalytic activity.

         <title>Tricarbonyl Rhenium&#8208;Based PROTACs Degrade the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Mpro Protease</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel metallo&#8208;PROTAC platform (Re2) for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Mpro degradation is synthesized by integrating a covalent rhenium(I) warhead with pomalidomide. This work overcomes intrinsic PROTAC permeability barriers through metalation, enabling three&#8208; to fourfold enhanced cellular uptake and inducing UPS&#8208;mediated protease degradation. The strategy establishes coordination chemistry&#8208;tunable metal complexes as potent solutions for high&#8208;efficacy targeted protein degradation.








ABSTRACT
Targeted protein degradation (TPD) using proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs) offers advantages over occupancy&#8208;based inhibitors but faces challenges,&#160;including ligand discovery and cellular permeability. To address these limitations, we developed Re2, a metallo&#8208;PROTAC integrating a covalent rhenium(I) complex warhead targeting SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease (Mpro) Cys145 with the cereblon E3 ligase ligand pomalidomide. Re2 induced effective intracellular Mpro degradation at 100&#160;nM within 72 h, which is significantly below its parent complex's enzymatic inhibition concentration. In vitro and ex vivo studies confirmed covalent Mpro binding and ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system&#8208;dependent degradation. Crucially, Re2 exhibited three&#8208; to fourfold higher cellular uptake and greater intracellular accumulation than its demetallated organic counterpart, demonstrating that metalation overcomes intrinsic PROTAC permeability barriers. This work establishes metallo&#8208;PROTACs, exploiting the tunable coordination chemistry of metal complexes for enhanced target engagement and cellular delivery, as a potent strategy for designing high&#8208;potent PROTACs.

         <title>(NH4)2[Tc2O2(S2O7)4]: An Unexpected Technetium(V)&#8208;Sulfate From the Reaction of (NH4)(TcO4) With SO3</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of the radioactive pertechnetate (99TcO4)&#8722; with the oxidizer SO3 leads to blue crystals of (NH4)2[Tc2O2(S2O7)4]. The complex dimeric [Tc2O2(S2O7)4]2&#8722; anion exhibits the technetium in the oxidation state V, showing that reduction occurs during the reaction.








ABSTRACT
The reaction of ammonium pertechnetate, (NH4)(TcO4), with SO3 leads to crystals of (NH4)2[Tc2O2(S2O7)4] (monoclinic, P21/c, Z&#160;= 2, a&#160;= 775.67(5), b&#160;= 1339.55(8), c&#160;= 1233.32(8) pm, &#946; = 100.566(2)&#176;). The compound contains the dimeric [Tc2O2(S2O7)4]2&#8722; anion with the Tc atom connected by disulfate anions. It is astonishing that even under the oxidizing reaction conditions, reduction of the Tc(VII) starting material occurs. Contrastingly, an analogous reaction of (NH4)(ReO4) with SO3 gives the Re(VII) sulfate (NH4)[ReO2(S2O7)2] (orthorhombic, Pca21, Z&#160;= 8, a&#160;= 1842.7(1), b&#160;= 847.03(5), c&#160;= 1663.8(1) pm). The compounds have been further studied by vibrational spectroscopy and quantum mechanical calculations.

         <title>Biocompatible SABRE Hyperpolarization of [1&#8208;13C]Ketoleucine for Cellular Metabolic Flux Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the biocompatible production of hyperpolarized [1&#8208;13C]ketoleucine, a branched&#8208;chain amino acid probe. Using SABRE hyperpolarization, relying on parahydrogen as a source of hyperpolarized state, we produce a biocompatible solution of this probe and visualize the enzymatic conversion in live yeast cells, establishing a platform for studying branched&#8208;chain amino acid metabolism with cellular and clinical significance.








ABSTRACT
Ketoleucine (&#945;&#8208;ketoisocaproate) is a novel hyperpolarized substrate for noninvasive metabolic imaging, enabling rapid, high&#8208;sensitivity detection of branched&#8208;chain amino acid flux, a pathway that is aberrant in many diseases including cancer and Alzheimer's disease. Utilizing NMR Signal Amplification by Reversible Exchange (SABRE) with an 80:20 acetone:water solvent system, we achieved &gt;11% polarization of [1&#8208;13C]ketoleucine (corresponding to signal enhancement over 230,000&#8208;fold at 0.55 T) at 70&#160;mM within 2 min, using parahydrogen as a cheap and fast source of hyperpolarization. A two&#8208;stage liquid&#8211;liquid extraction and gas stripping protocol removes excess excipients, yielding a biocompatible aqueous solution of [1&#8208;13C]ketoleucine (79 &#177; 10&#160;mM). When mixed with Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast), hyperpolarized [1&#8208;13C]ketoleucine produced strong, long&#8208;lasting signals, where downstream metabolites are observed for &gt;200&#160;s, allowing first&#8208;order kinetic modeling of CO2 and bicarbonate. These cell experiments demonstrate both the biocompatibility and signal strength of SABRE&#8211;hyperpolarized KL, establishing KL as a versatile hyperpolarized agent and opening avenues for real&#8208;time investigation of metabolic dysregulation in cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and beyond.

The fat&#8208;soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) react with 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazoline&#8208;3,5&#8208;dione in a one pot reaction to distinct adducts.

The simplicity and high yield of the reaction offer the potential to apply it to analysis of all fat&#8208;soluble vitamins in complex sample matrices.








ABSTRACT
(RRR)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;tocopherol reacts with 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazoline&#8208;3,5&#8208;dione (PTAD) at ambient conditions in a fast formal [6+2+2] addition reaction yielding four pairs of diastereomers, three of them containing novel heterocyclic ring systems. Structure elucidation required customized 3,5&#8208;13C2,4&#8208;15N labelled PTAD to establish the connectivity of the PTAD units using 4&#8211;5J 1H&#8208;13C, 2J 13C&#8208;13C, and 1J 13C&#8208;14N NMR correlations. Absolute stereochemistry was determined based on calculated CD spectra compared to experimental data. The reaction occurred also with related 6&#8208;chromanols and required a free phenolic hydroxy group. As one possibility, the addition of the first PTAD involves a hetero&#8208;Alder&#8208;ene reaction, followed by a Diels&#8211;Alder or alternative addition / cyclization of a second PTAD. Together with the derivatization of vitamin K and the known reactions with vitamins A and D, PTAD can thus derivatize all fat&#8208;soluble vitamins in a one pot reaction, offering potential new applications for their analysis in complex matrices.

         <title>Synthesis of 2&#8242;&#8208;O,4&#8242;&#8208;C&#945;&#8208;Dimethyl Ribonucleoside Analogs and Their Effects on RNA and Modulation of ADAR Editing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2&#8242;&#8208;O,4&#8242;&#8208;C&#945;&#8208;dimethyl nucleic acids (24mNA) were synthesized, and their biophysical properties in RNA and in RNA editing were evaluated. 24mNA modulate duplex thermal stability in an analog&#8208;dependent manner, and based on crystal structures of mono&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;Me&#8208;containing RNA, the 4&#8242;&#8208;Me group projects toward the minor groove of the duplex. Additionally, 24mNA imparts high site specificity for RNA editing 5&#8217;&#8208;UA and 5&#8217;&#8208;AA ADAR targets.








ABSTRACT
Oligonucleotides capable of guiding adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) to carry out therapeutic adenosine (A) to inosine (I) editing constitute a promising new class of nucleic acid therapeutics. However, our understanding of the impact of different chemical modifications at the various nucleotide positions in ADAR guide strands is limited. While ribose 2&#8242; modification is common in ADAR&#8208;directing guides, less is known about the impact of modification at the 4&#8242; position. Here we describe the synthesis of several 4&#8242;&#8208;C&#945;&#8208;methyl and 2&#8242;&#8208;O, 4&#8242;&#8208;C&#945;&#8208;dimethyl derivatives of adenosine, uridine, and cytidine and their incorporation into RNA. In addition, we show that these analogs maintain the base pairing selectivity of their parent nucleoside and modulate duplex thermal stability in an analog&#8208;dependent manner. High&#8208;resolution crystal structures of RNA duplexes bearing 4&#8242;&#8208;C&#945;&#8208;methyl A or U showed that these analogs adopt a C3&#8242;&#8208;endo sugar pucker and project 4&#8242; substituents into the minor groove. Finally, we find that 2&#8242;&#8208;O, 4&#8242;&#8208;C&#945;&#8208;dimethyluridine and 2&#8242;&#8208;O, 4&#8242;&#8208;C&#945;&#8208;dimethyladenosine strategically positioned in ADAR guide strands can increase the selectivity of the editing reaction for target sequences with adjacent off&#8208;target adenosines. This work advances our understanding of the ADAR reaction mechanism and informs the design of ADAR guide strands with improved selectivity.

         <title>Design of Uniform Polymer Nanoparticles via Living Crystallization Driven Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Living crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA), employing a seeded growth method, has emerged as a pivotal strategy for achieving precise control of anisotropic nanoparticles. A critical aspect of this technique lies in heteroepitaxial crystallization, which transcends the chemical composition constraints of conventional homoepitaxy and enables the design of segmented structures with spatially distinct core components.








ABSTRACT
Living crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA), employing a seeded growth method, has emerged as a pivotal strategy for achieving precise control of anisotropic nanoparticles over the dimensions and structure, which enables the fabrication of 1D cylinders and 2D platelets with low dispersity. This versatile and robust approach, characterized by linearly tunable dimensions and programmability of structural sequences, has been widely applied in the construction of nanoparticles exhibiting uniform size and controlled architecture. A critical aspect of this technique lies in heteroepitaxial crystallization, which transcends the chemical composition constraints of conventional homoepitaxy and enables the design of segmented structures with spatially distinct core components. Building upon this foundation, we elucidate the key aspects of living CDSA seed growth, with a particular emphasis on exploring the mechanism of governing heteroepitaxial growth from crystalline seeds with distinctly chemical compositions. Elucidating the intricate mechanisms of heteroepitaxial crystallization allows access to broaden the design possibilities for segmented nanoparticles with spatially defined core compositions and functionalities. Moreover, the new developing methods for facile synthesis of uniform particles with high solid concentrations are also reviewed, which are promising for the real applications of these advanced nanomaterials.

         <title>Dynamics and Conformational Stability of Chiral Bay&#8208;Phenolate&#8208;Substituted Twisted Octaazaperopyrenedioxides (OAPPDOs)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral octaazaperopyrenedioxide (OAPPDO) fluorophores were obtained by functionalizing with BINOL and related fragments bridging the bay position. They possess conformational flexibility but remarkable thermal stability with respect to racemization of the central chromophore, which allowed the study of their chiroptical properties, including circular polarized luminescence (CPL).








ABSTRACT
Configurationally stable chiral octaazaperopyrene dioxide (OAPPDO) derivatives were obtained by nucleophilic substitution of chiral BINOL and related fragments as bridging units onto the bay position. The addition of these phenolate derivatives has given rise to a new group of bright chiral fluorophores with remarkable thermal stability, which allowed the study of their chiroptical properties, in particular, their circular dichroism characteristics as well as circular polarized luminescence (CPL), albeit with a low dissymmetry factor (glum) in the range of 2*10&#8722;4. The introduction of the BINOL bridging groups in the bay position led to equilibria between chiral conformers in solution, the interconversion of which has been studied by DFT modeling, with the two lowest energy species being directly observable in situ by NMR. Insight into the stability of these derivatives with respect to overall racemization has been obtained by DFT modeling which established an overall activation barrier for the process of above 170&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Chemical Systems That Mimic Biological Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemists are designing synthetic systems that mimic life's dynamic behaviors, such as motion, sensing, adaptation, and compartmentalization, by integrating reaction networks with stimuli like light, pH, and chemical fuels. This mini&#8208;review surveys molecular machines, responsive materials, nucleic acid networks, and artificial cells, highlighting how chemical design drives the emergence of life&#8208;like functions.








ABSTRACT
Living systems achieve adaptability, motion, and self&#8208;regulation through chemical networks operating out of equilibrium. Reproducing these dynamics synthetically demands precise control over kinetics, thermodynamics, and molecular design to convert energy inputs into time&#8208;programmed function. Recent advances in stimuli&#8208;responsive and chemically powered systems show how life&#8208;like behaviors such as oscillations, autonomous motion, adaptive responses, and compartmentalization can be encoded using fuel&#8208;driven cycles and stimulus&#8208;gated switches powered by chemical, photonic, or enzymatic inputs. This mini&#8208;review highlights molecular assemblies that sustain transient states, molecular machines powered by specific chemical inputs, responsive materials that reconfigure in response to environmental triggers, nucleic acid&#8208;based networks for sensing and regulation, and artificial cells that exhibit compartmentalization and signaling. Together, these developments bridge systems chemistry and biomimicry, expanding the chemical toolkit for engineering matter that can adapt and respond. Beyond mimicking biology, such systems deepen our understanding of the molecular foundations of living matter and open new routes to technology. Self&#8208;powered systems, molecular motors, smart materials, and artificial cells now form a rapidly growing toolbox with the potential to impact drug discovery, biosensing, energy, food production, and materials science. The field's future lies in integrating multiple life&#8208;essential functions into a single construct, ultimately enabling synthetic systems that replicate the complex network behaviors of living organisms and inspire next&#8208;generation innovation.

         <title>Optical Dissymmetry of As&#8208;Grown Twisted Paracetamol Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
Paracetamol crystalline form III grows just above the glass transition temperature as aggressively twisted fibers that thicken in successive stages, forming complex assemblies. The growth direction is parallel to a glide plane leading to heterochiral crystals. These enantiomorphs are not Pasteur&#8208;like polyhedra with hemihedral facets that are the tell&#8208;tale signs of dissymmetric form; here every surface is dissymmetric. The chiroptical properties of the heterochiral forms are assayed as they evolve directly in the solid state using complete polarimetry.

         <title>TEMPO in Solution, Melted, Solid, and Adsorbed on a Silica Surface: A Paramagnetic NMR Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Paramagnetic species can often be measured with EPR and NMR spectroscopy. This is demonstrated using the important radical TEMPO. All 1H and 13C NMR signals of TEMPO could be recorded and assigned. The impact of TEMPO on the chemical shifts of solvent signals and a phosphine is described.








ABSTRACT
TEMPO (2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1&#8208;piperidinyloxy) is a stable radical that is phenomenologically interesting and of high importance in synthesis and catalysis. This radical has been studied extensively with EPR and used as a spin tag for biological materials and to probe hydrogen bonding. The NMR properties of TEMPO have not yet been reported. This contribution describes that all 1H and 13C NMR signals of TEMPO are visible in the paramagnetic NMR spectra. The 1H NMR spectra of TEMPO solutions have a chemical shift range of 50&#160;ppm and require only 8 scans. The 13C NMR signals are localized within a chemical shift range of 2600&#160;ppm and are obtained within 30 minutes. Samples prepared with different solvents and TEMPO concentrations have been investigated, and it has been demonstrated that all solvents undergo chemical shift changes due to the presence of TEMPO and adduct formation in the case of CDCl3. The impact of TEMPO on the 31P chemical shift of PPh3 is studied. Higher concentrations of TEMPO in solution lead to narrower signals and the molten substance, measured at 60&#176;C, represents the culmination of this trend. It is demonstrated with paramagnetic solid&#8208;state NMR that TEMPO adsorbs on a silica surface and displays the chemical shift and linewidth features of a dilute solution of TEMPO.

         <title>Bioorthogonal Chemistry in Biomolecule Quantification: A Review of Reactions and Strategies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the application of catalyst&#8208;free bioorthogonal reactions: Staudinger ligation, strain promoted azide alkyne cycloaddition, inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder, and 2&#8208;cyanobenzothiazole cysteine condensation in the semi&#8208;quantitative and quantitative analysis of biomolecules. These reactions offer fast kinetics, high selectivity, and good biocompatibility, enabling diverse detection strategies for accurate biomolecule quantification.








ABSTRACT
Bioorthogonal chemistry has emerged as a transformative strategy for detecting and quantifying biomolecules in complex biological systems. This review highlights recent advances in catalyst&#8208;free bioorthogonal reactions specifically applied to semi&#8208;quantitative and quantitative biomolecular analysis. We exclude reactions that require toxic or complex catalysts and focus on four reactions: Staudinger ligation, strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition, inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, and 2&#8208;cyanobenzothiazole&#8211;cysteine condensation. For each, we discuss reaction kinetics and strategies for representative applications in biomolecular quantification. The scope of target biomolecules varies by reaction, including proteins, nucleic acids, glycans, and small molecules. Quantification techniques such as fluorescence spectroscopy, luminescence spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry are examined, with reported limits of detection typically ranging from nanomolar to micromolar, and a few advanced techniques reaching femtomolar or attomolar sensitivity. Each reaction is discussed in terms of kinetics, molecular compatibility, and analytical sensitivity. Finally, we outline key challenges and future opportunities, emphasizing the need for faster reaction kinetics, improved probe design, enhanced integration with advanced analytical platforms, and standardized methods to improve reproducibility and cross&#8208;study comparability in biomolecular quantification.

         <title>Lattice Oxygen&#8211;Mediated Water Oxidation on Reconstructed Ni3S2/NiFeOOH Heterointerfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon electrochemical activation, Ni3S2/NiFe&#8208;LDH catalysts undergo transformation to Ni3S2/NiFeOOH. This structural reconstruction not only exposes additional catalytic active sites but also activates lattice oxygen species, thereby triggering the lattice oxygen reaction pathway. By circumventing the thermodynamic constraints inherent to the adsorbate mechanism, the reconstructed catalyst achieves a reduced overpotential, ultimately enhancing its oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic performance.








ABSTRACT
Developing cost&#8208;effective oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts for industrial current densities remains challenging, hindered by adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) scaling limitations and reconstruction instability. Here, we report a heterointerface&#8208;engineered Ni3S2/NiFeOOH catalyst formed via in&#8208;situ electrochemical reconstruction of Ni3S2/NiFe&#8208;LDH. Interfacial charge redistribution stabilizes high&#8208;valent Ni3+/Fe3+ species and generates coordinatively unsaturated lattice oxygen sites, thereby activating the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM). Combined operando spectroscopy, pH&#8208;dependent kinetics, and isotope labeling confirm LOM dominance. Further theoretical analyses reveal that the heterointerface downshifts the metal d&#8208;band center and upshifts the O 2p&#8208;band center, optimized intermediate adsorption free energy. Benefiting from the compatible multi&#8208;mechanism, the reconstructed catalyst demonstrates outstanding OER performance, only requires overpotentials of 196/305&#160;mV to drive current densities of 10/1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in alkaline media, with robust stability for over 500&#160;h. This work clarifies how interfacial electronic modulation connects pre&#8208;catalyst reconstruction to LOM activation, providing a scalable design strategy for high&#8208;current&#8208;density OER electrocatalysts.

The enhanced accessibility of active catalytic sites in 2D Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) is promising for achieving superior catalytic performance. However, the achievement of abundant active catalytic sites along with excellent chemical stability onto a 2D MOF is a formidable challenge and of significant interest. Herein, we have strategically designed and developed a new Lewis&#8208;acidic 2D Ni&#8208;MOF: IITKGP&#8208;61 employing mixed ligand synthesis approach. Interestingly, MOF: IITKGP&#8208;61, even being a 2D framework maintained its superior crystallinity in liquid water for a month and across a wide range of aqueous pH solutions (2&#8211;12) due to the combined contribution from both thermodynamic and kinetic stability factors. With the abundant accessible open metal sites (two OMSs per formula unit), the developed framework was explored in the biologically important Hantzsch condensation reaction under the sustainable synthetic pathway. Good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields were achieved for a broad scope of substrates even with lower catalyst loading. Most importantly, to verify the practical utility, MOF: IITKGP&#8208;61 was employed for the synthesis of a biologically important 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridine molecule with antidiabetic properties in ethanol as green solvent with excellent yield. Utilization of a MOF catalyst in such a direction is scarce in the literature and thus demands extensive future research.

         <title>Dynamic Olefinic Bond Restructuring in Coordination Polymers Enables Precision Photocycloaddition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D Cd&#8208;based coordination polymer (CP1) is reported to dynamically restructure double bonds for selective [2+2] photocycloaddition under the co&#8208;regulation of solvent vapor and visible light, with MeOH/H2O guests further dictating the regioselective pathway for distinct products.








ABSTRACT
Biological systems adapt their conformations and reactivities in response to diverse external cues, inspiring the development of synthetic materials with similar responsiveness for controlled chemical transformations. Here we report a flexible coordination polymer, [{Cd4(OCH3&#8208;BPEB)4(OBA)4}&#183;7DEF]n (CP1, OCH3&#8208;BPEB = 4,4'&#8208;((1E,1'E)&#8208;(2,5&#8208;dimethoxyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;phenylene)bis(ethene&#8208;2,1&#8208;diyl))dipyridine, H2OBA = 4,4'&#8208;oxybis(benzoic acid), DEF = N,N&#8208;diethylformamide), capable of multistimuli&#8208;induced restructuring of otherwise inactive olefinic bond pairs to achieve regioselective [2+2] photocycloadditions. Sequence exposure to solvent vapours and visible light drives stepwise structural transformations, producing two monocyclobutane isomers&#8212;4,4'&#8208;((1S,3R)bis(2,5&#8208;dimethoxyl&#8208;4&#8208;((E)&#8208;2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)vinyl)phenyl)cyclobutane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diyl)dipyridine (OCH3&#8208;PCDP) and 4,4'&#8208;((1R,2R,3S,4S)&#8208;2,4&#8208;bis(2,5&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;4&#8208;((E)&#8208;2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)vinyl)phenyl)cyclobutane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyl)dipyridine, (2,4&#8208;OCH3&#8208;PCDP)&#8212;from their respective photoirradiated derivatives [{Cd4(OCH3&#8208;PCDP)2(OBA)4}&#183;3DEF]n (CP2) and [{Cd4(2,4&#8208;OCH3&#8208;PCDP)2(OBA)4}&#183;3MeOH]n (CP3, MeOH = methanol). Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction captures five intermediate structures, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations elucidate how stimuli&#8208;mediated realignment of olefinic pairs dictates regioselectivity. This work demonstrates precise photochemical cyclobutane synthesis within a coordination polymer single&#8208;crystal platform, offering mechanistic insights applicable to the broader design of stimuli&#8208;controlled photoreactions and functional materials.

         <title>One&#8208;pot Base&#8208;free Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura [11C]Methylation: Kinetic and Mechanistic Insights</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A base&#8208;free Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura [11C]methylation is achieved in a one&#8208;pot process with [11C]CH3I on moderate yields. Electronic effects enable transmetallation without boronate activation, while kinetics and DFT show oxidative addition (heterolytic) as the rate&#8208;limiting step.








ABSTRACT
The Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction is one of the most powerful approaches for forming carbon&#8211;carbon bonds in the synthesis of carbon&#8208;11&#8211;labeled positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers. Typically, Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling is performed in the presence of a base to activate the boron reagent and sustain the catalytic cycle. Here, we investigate the capacity of the Suzuki reaction to proceed under one&#8208;pot base&#8208;free conditions for [11C]methylation reactions and elucidate the mechanistic features that enable this transformation. Conditions were optimized to successfully achieve one&#8208;pot methylation of a model substrate using [11C]CH3I in the absence of base in moderate yields. Systematic substrate studies reveal that the reaction is partly governed by the electronic properties of the boron substrate, suggesting an alternative transmetallation pathway in this case. Kinetic studies using [14C]CH3I, together with kinetic isotope effect (KIE) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, reveal that oxidative addition remains the rate&#8208;determining step through a heterolytic pathway, consistent with the formation of a cationic Pd(II) intermediate that can undergo transmetallation in the absence of base. Together, these results provide new mechanistic insights into Pd&#8208;mediated [11C]C&#8211;C bond formation under the unique stoichiometric constraints of radiochemical conditions, expanding the understanding of base&#8208;free cross&#8208;coupling reactions with [11C]CH3I.

         <title>Photochemistry of Aromatic N&#8208;Oxides in Water Probed by Time&#8208;Resolved X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Time&#8208;resolved XAS at the nitrogen and oxygen K&#8208;edges is applied to the photorearrangement of two N&#8208;oxides in water. Pyridine N&#8208;oxide rapidly forms the oxaziridine isomer. Pyridazine N&#8208;oxide undergoes ring opening to the diazo compound, without any evidence of intermediates.








ABSTRACT
Aromatic N&#8208;oxides have a rich photochemistry, but the primary steps have not been investigated in much detail. In this work pyridine N&#8208;oxide and pyridazine N&#8208;oxide are studied using steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Absorption changes at the nitrogen and oxygen K&#8208;edges following UV photoexcitation are recorded on a timescale of picoseconds to hundreds of nanoseconds. The spectral features are assigned to the presence of specific transient intermediates. Quantum chemical calculations indicate that the excited state dynamics in the S1 state are characterized by a fast deplanarization. After reaching a minimum energy crossing point (MECP), evolution on the ground state surface leads to the starting materials and metastable products. The primary photoproduct of pyridine N&#8208;oxide, oxaziridine 3, is stable on the sub&#8208;microsecond timescale. In the photochemistry of pyridazine N&#8208;oxide, oxaziridine and oxadiazepine intermediates are not observed, and (Z)&#8208;4&#8208;diazobut&#8208;2&#8208;enal is formed within 100&#160;ps. The mechanistic details of the two different N&#8208;oxides uncovered through characteristic features in the near&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) region serve as an example of how time&#8208;resolved XAS enables the characterization of photochemical dynamics beyond those accessible to more traditional spectroscopies.

ABSTRACT
Designing and synthesizing condensed, thermally stable zeolites by inverse sigma expansion of open&#8208;framework zeolites has been well achieved. However, creating thermally stable open&#8208;framework zeolites through sigma expansion of condensed&#8208;frameworks remains rare. Herein, we present the rational design and synthesis of a thermally stable medium&#8208;pore aluminosilicate zeolite SCM&#8208;53, which possesses a 2D 10&#160;&#215; 10&#8208;ring channel system. The framework of SCM&#8208;53 was theoretically predicted by sigma expansion of the framework of SCM&#8208;51, a small&#8208;pore aluminosilicate zeolite featuring a 2D 8&#160;&#215; 8&#8208;ring channel system prepared by calcination of the layered precursor SCM&#8208;50. SCM&#8208;53 was rationally synthesized by successive interlayer silylation and calcination treatments of SCM&#8208;50. The structure of SCM&#8208;53 was validated by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and N2 absorption measurement. Our results demonstrate that SCM&#8208;53 possesses accessible micropores (5.9&#160;&#215; 4.9 &#197;), an ultrathin nanosheet morphology (&#8764;15&#160;nm), and high thermal stability (up to 800 &#176;C), suggesting its potential for adsorption and catalytic applications. We anticipate that sigma expansion offers a promising approach for the rational design and synthesis of targeted novel zeolite structures.

&lt;p&gt;Designing and synthesizing condensed, thermally stable zeolites by inverse sigma expansion of open-framework zeolites has been well achieved. However, creating thermally stable open-framework zeolites through sigma expansion of condensed-frameworks remains rare. Herein, we present the rational design and synthesis of a thermally stable medium-pore aluminosilicate zeolite SCM-53, which possesses a 2D 10&#160;&#215; 10-ring channel system. The framework of SCM-53 was theoretically predicted by sigma expansion of the framework of SCM-51, a small-pore aluminosilicate zeolite featuring a 2D 8&#160;&#215; 8-ring channel system prepared by calcination of the layered precursor SCM-50. SCM-53 was rationally synthesized by successive interlayer silylation and calcination treatments of SCM-50. The structure of SCM-53 was validated by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; absorption measurement. Our results demonstrate that SCM-53 possesses accessible micropores (5.9&#160;&#215; 4.9 &#197;), an ultrathin nanosheet morphology (&#8764;15&#160;nm), and high thermal stability (up to 800 &#176;C), suggesting its potential for adsorption and catalytic applications.

         <title>Rectifying Contact&#8208;induced Electronic Regulation of Fe Within Nitrogen&#8208;doped Carbon for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rectifying contact between Fe nanoparticles and N&#8208;doped 3D honeycomb&#8208;like carbon can induce a built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF) for optimizing charge redistribution of activity center, thereby endowing Fe&#8208;NPs@N&#8208;HC with excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity in alkaline medium and zinc air battery performance.








ABSTRACT
Developing efficient and durable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts from earth&#8208;abundant elements is of great significance for the advancement of sustainable energy technologies such as rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries. Herein, we present a 3D honeycomb&#8208;like nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix decorated to in&#8208;situ form Fe nanoparticles (denoted as Fe&#8208;NPs@N&#8208;HC) via an ice&#8208;templating method. Theoretical calculations and experimental analyses collectively reveal that the work function mismatch between metallic Fe and the N&#8208;doped carbon host drives spontaneous charge transfer, establishing a built&#8208;in electric field at the heterointerface to form the rectifying contact. This interfacial effect fine tunes electronic structure and optimizes the adsorption of oxygen intermediates, thereby accelerating the ORR kinetics. Benefiting from these synergistic effects, Fe&#8208;NPs@N&#8208;HC achieves a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.86&#160;V, superior tolerance to methanol, and excellent long&#8208;term durability in alkaline media. When integrated into a liquid zinc&#8208;air battery, Fe&#8208;NPs@N&#8208;HC also delivers a high peak power density of 126.4&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and outstanding cycling stability exceeding 482 cycles, surpassing the benchmark Pt/C&#8208;based system. This work demonstrates that tailoring the electronic structure through interfacial engineering, coupled with rational 3D framework design, provides a promising strategy for the development of next&#8208;generation nonprecious metal catalysts for practical energy conversion applications.

         <title>Supramolecular Host&#8208;Guest Complexation Dynamics by Cost&#8208;Efficient Electronic Structure Methods</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a cost&#8208;effective multilevel workflow for the kinetic profiling of host&#8211;guest systems, illustrated with cucurbit[6]uril and alkylammonium cations. The method combines rapid docking and reaction path searches at the semi&#8208;empirical level, with refinement of the results using modern density functional theory, accurately reproducing experiment and enabling routine analysis of supramolecular host&#8211;guest association mechanisms.








ABSTRACT
Multilevel computational approaches based on electronic structure methods currently enable the accurate structural and thermodynamic characterization of medium to large&#8208;sized host&#8211;guest systems, but have been scarcely used to systematically study their kinetics. Here, we show how this type of protocol can be easily applied for the task, using the well&#8208;known complexation reaction between the cucurbit[6]uril host and alkylammonium cations as a test case. To this end, the recently reported aISS docking workflow is used for the fast exploration of the coconformational space of a set of nine host&#8211;guest aggregates, at the robust and fast semiempirical GFN2&#8208;xTB(ALPB) level of theory. After identification of appropriate intermediates and reaction products, those can be in turn efficiently connected by the Nudged Elastic Band method, enabling fast screening of different potential reaction mechanisms, and the identification of the corresponding transition states. Further refinement of the equilibrium geometries and a better energetic description of the stationary points is nevertheless mandatory, for instance with the state of the art and efficient &#969;B97X&#8208;3c(COSMO&#8208;RS)//r2SCAN&#8208;3c(CPCM) density functional&#8208;based protocol, which not only accurately reproduces the experimental reference values of the free energy of association (MAE = 1.4&#160;kcal/mol), but also the kinetic in/out barriers reported for the processes (MAE = 2.0 and 2.9&#160;kcal/mol, respectively). Overall, this work presents a robust and cost&#8208;effective multilevel workflow for the routine kinetic profiling of supramolecular association processes.

         <title>Cobalt(II) Single&#8208;Chain Magnet with Strong Anisotropy and Ferromagnetic IntraChain Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new high&#8208;performance single&#8208;chain magnet (Ueff = 560 K) exhibits strong magnetic anisotropy and ferromagnetic intrachain interactions using redox&#8208;active bridging ligands.








ABSTRACT
Co(II)&#8208;based coordination polymer is reported as a new benchmark single&#8208;chain magnet (SCM), exhibiting an energy barrier (Ueff) of 560 K and a blocking temperature (TB) of 21.5 K&#8210;both the highest values observed for SCM systems. The magnetic behavior originates from the synergistic balance between strong axial anisotropy (DCo = &#8211;83 cm&#8722;1) and moderate ferromagnetic exchange (JCo&#8208;Co = +17.7 K), promoting long&#8208;range spin correlation over thousands of magnetic ions. Detailed analysis of the correlation length and domain&#8208;wall energy reveals a wide SCM regime and a 1D&#8208;to&#8208;3D magnetic crossover at low temperature. Unlike previously reported radical&#8208;bridged SCMs, this work demonstrates a clean, intrinsic design strategy for realizing extreme single&#8208;chain magnetism, offering new principles for developing robust molecular spin materials.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks as Efficient Photocatalysts for Sustainable Ammonia Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
COFs are an emerging class of porous materials that exhibit excellent photocatalytic and electrocatalytic properties. Photocatalytic sustainable ammonia synthesis is a new research hotspot in the field of photocatalysis, holding significant importance for reducing global carbon emissions. New materials are being employed to address new challenges in emerging fields, demonstrating captivating characteristics. Perhaps, sustainable ammonia synthesis will become the most promising application direction in the coming years, with COFs serving as a key enabler in advancing this process.








ABSTRACT
Ammonia is one of the most important industrial products. The Haber&#8208;Bosch process has enabled large&#8208;scale ammonia production but also results in substantial carbon emissions. Amid growing environmental concerns, there is an urgent need to transform this highly energy&#8208;intensive process and develop ammonia synthesis technologies under mild conditions. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), as one of the most prominent emerging materials in recent years, have demonstrated exceptional application potential and advantages in various fields such as photocatalysis and electrocatalysis. The modular structural design of COFs allows for tunable band gaps according to practical requirements, their permanent porosity endows the materials with excellent adsorption capabilities for reactants, and the abundant heteroatoms provide numerous reactive sites. Currently, COFs&#8208;based catalysts have achieved high performance in various photocatalytic applications, and sustainable ammonia synthesis is highly likely to become the next research focus. This review summarizes the fundamental principles of photocatalytic ammonia synthesis, methods for ammonia detection, and the research progress in COFs&#8208;based materials for ammonia synthesis. Finally, it analyzes and discusses the future challenges and prospects of this emerging field of sustainable ammonia synthesis using COFs.

         <title>Helicene&#8208;Based Chiral Macrocycles and Molecular Cages: Synthetic Strategies, Chiroptical Modulation, and Emerging Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview provides a concise overview of recent progress in the design and synthesis of helicene&#8208;based covalent and coordination macrocycles and cages, focusing on advances in synthetic strategies, modulation of chiroptical properties, and emerging opportunities in next&#8208;generation chiral technologies.








ABSTRACT
Macrocycles and molecular cages possess enzyme&#8208;like cavities whose size, shape, and functionality can be precisely engineered.&#160;Helicenes, characterized by rigid &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbones and inherent helical chirality, serve as exceptional scaffolds for constructing highly distorted chiral macrocycles and cages.&#160;These supramolecular architectures demonstrate enhanced circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), enantioselective recognition, and efficient guest adsorption.&#160;This minireview provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in helicene&#8208;based coordination and covalent strategies, highlighting synthetic methodologies, chiroptical modulation, and emerging applications.&#160;Key challenges&#8212;including fluorescence quenching in metallacages, synthetic complexity, and limited structural diversity&#8212;are critically discussed. We also highlight potential opportunities involving high&#8208;emission linkages, dynamic covalent strategies, and stimuli&#8208;responsive designs.&#160;Collectively, these insights establish a framework for the rational design of helicene&#8208;derived macrocycles and three&#8208;dimensional cages, paving the way toward the development of advanced chiral functional materials.

         <title>Investigating N2 Fixation Using a Bulky Fe(bisphosphine)2 Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bulky Fe(0) N2 complex Fe(N2)(dibpe)2 has been prepared and efficiently produces NH3/N2H4 upon treatment with acid, similarly to previously investigated Fe(N2)(depe)2. However, it performs much less effectively during attempted catalytic N2 fixation, allowing investigation of the crucial role of steric hindrance in steps such as N2 binding and protonation.








ABSTRACT
An iron(0) dinitrogen complex incorporating highly sterically encumbered bisphosphine ligands, Fe(N2)(dibpe)2 (dibpe&#160;= iBu2PCH2CH2PiBu2), iBu1&#183;N2, has been prepared and thoroughly characterized, and its N2 fixation reactivity assessed. iBu1&#183;N2 is a more hindered analogue of Fe(N2)(depe)2 (depe&#160;= Et2PCH2CH2PEt2), Et1&#183;N2, which has previously been shown to be an efficient N2 reduction catalyst with unusual selectivity for N2H4, and it was anticipated that greater bulk might make iBu1&#183;N2 less prone to deleterious side reactivity, improving performance. The N2 ligand in iBu1&#183;N2 displays a similar degree of activation to Et1&#183;N2, and the two complexes can stoichiometrically fix N2 with similarly high efficiency upon treatment with suitable acids, giving mixtures of NH3 and N2H4. However, attempts to catalytically fix N2 via treatment of iBu1&#183;N2 with mixtures of excess acids and reductants led to poor results. Mechanistic investigations implicate a combination of more sluggish reaction kinetics and weaker binding of N2 to the intermediate Fe(I) cation [Fe(dibpe)2]+, [iBu1]+, whose study was aided by isolation as its BArF4&#8722; salt (ArF&#160;= 3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl), and which has also been fully characterized. This weak interaction hinders regeneration of the initial iBu1&#183;N2 via reduction of [iBu1&#183;N2]+, which appears to be necessary to close the catalytic cycle.

         <title>Evaluation of a New Methylimidazole&#8208;Containing Thiosemicarbazone as a Cu+/Cu2+&#8208;Targeting Ligand in the Context of Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
HXE modulates Cu(A&#946;) interaction, reducing ROS production and shifting peptide aggregation in the presence of Cu from toxic amorphous aggregates to less harmful fibrillar structures. These findings highlight HXE potential to interfere with Cu&#8208;induced oxidative stress and aggregation pathways relevant to AD.








ABSTRACT
The binding of copper ions to amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptide leads to reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and toxic soluble oligomers, contributing to oxidative stress in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, studying compounds with moderate copper affinity is a promising strategy to prevent its interaction with A&#946; and reduce toxicity. Here, we evaluated a new tri&#8208;coordinating thiosemicarbazone (HXE) with chelating properties to regulate cuprotoxicity in AD. The ligand was nontoxic against HT&#8208;22 hippocampal neuronal cells and bound Cu+ and Cu2+ at pH 7.4, with affinity constants (log Kcond) of 8.7 and 12.3, respectively, showing high selectivity over Zn2+ (log Kapp = 5.0). In the presence of A&#946; and Cu2+, HXE formed stable ternary complexes at physiological pH. Ascorbate consumption and coumarin&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylic acid fluorescence assays showed that the ligand significantly reduces Cu(A&#946;16)&#8208;mediated ROS production. It also prevented Cu2+&#8208;induced modulation of A&#946;40 self&#8208;assembly and restored the typical fibrillar structure of apo&#8208;A&#946;40 aggregates. Overall, HXE effectively modulates metal&#8208;associated A&#946; toxicity and emerges as a promising candidate for AD bioinorganic management.

         <title>Titanium&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Hydrothiomethylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hermetically sealable, inexpensive 42&#8208;well aluminum reactor blocks are used to explore new reactivities of air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;sensitive titanium catalysts. As a result, methyl sulfides undergo efficient &#945;&#8208;alkylation with alkenes in the presence of a titanium catalyst precursor, a formamidinato ligand, and a Lewis acid, yielding branched hydrothiomethylation products with excellent regioselectivity. Graphical design by Melissa Schl&#252;schen.








ABSTRACT
A catalyst screening for six different &#945;&#8208;alkylation reactions of methyl sulfides with unsaturated substrates performed in hermetically sealable and inexpensive 42&#8208;well aluminum reactor blocks is described. As a result, a new titanium&#8208;catalyzed hydrothiomethylation reaction of alkenes, which takes place under C&#9472;H bond activation at the &#945;&#8208;carbon atom of simple methyl sulfides, is presented. The best catalyst is prepared in situ from the readily available titanium catalyst precursor Ti(CH2SiMe3)4, a formamidinato ligand precursor, and the Lewis acid [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4]. Although selected 1,2&#8208;disubstituted alkenes, for example, cyclohexene and cyclopentene, undergo successful hydrothiomethylation reactions, the best results are obtained with monosubstituted 1&#8208;alkenes. In these cases, the reactions take place with excellent regioselectivity and give branched hydrothiomethylation products exclusively (23 examples). When dimethyl sulfide is used as a substrate, either the monohydrothiomethylation product or the dihydrothiomethylation product can be obtained with very good selectivity.

Although selected 1,2-disubstituted alkenes, for example, cyclohexene and cyclopentene, undergo successful hydrothiomethylation reactions, the best results are obtained with monosubstituted 1-alkenes. In these cases, the reactions take place with excellent regioselectivity and give branched hydrothiomethylation products exclusively (23 examples). When dimethyl sulfide is used as a substrate, either the monohydrothiomethylation product or the dihydrothiomethylation product can be obtained with very good selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Acridane[4]Arenes: Scope of the Macro&#8208;Tetramerization, Derivatization Options, and Water&#8208;Soluble Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acridane[4]arenes (A4As) are introduced as a versatile, conformationally restricted macrocyclic platform accessible in six steps and good yields. Expanded lower&#8208;rim scope, selective upper&#8208;rim functionalization, and N&#8208;Boc modification enable controlled self&#8208;assembly into a dimeric cage that binds tetrabutylammonium salts. Further Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig diversification and ionic substituents afford water&#8208;soluble derivatives, establishing A4As as a broadly modular scaffold for supramolecular applications.








ABSTRACT
Macrocycles are essential scaffolds in supramolecular chemistry, offering versatile platforms for functionalization. Here, we report the optimization, expanded scope, and comprehensive derivatization strategies for acridane[4]arenes (A4A), a large macrocyclic platform featuring a conformationally restricted bowl shape analogous to resorcin[4]arene. The scope of the macrocyclization was expanded with four distinct &#8216;feet&#8217; substituents at the lower rim. Strategies for selective functionalization at the upper rim were developed, including&#160;N&#8208;Boc protection at each acridane subunit. This modification induced self&#8208;assembly into a dimeric cage in apolar solvents, which form stable host&#8211;guest complexes with tetrabutylammonium salts. Further functionalization of the acridane nitrogen via Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig cross&#8208;coupling allowed installation of aromatic groups bearing diverse functional handles. Finally, water&#8208;soluble A4A derivatives were achieved by introducing charged ionic &#8216;feet&#8217; substituents, such as 1&#8208;methylimidazolium. These results establish A4As as a highly modular macrocyclic platform with broad potential for supramolecular applications.

         <title>A BODIPY/Coumarin Hybrid Probe for Dual&#8208;Mode Fluorescent/FLIM Imaging of Endoplasmic Reticulum Micro&#8208;Polarity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed an ER&#8208;targeted probe&#160;MBDP&#160;via hybridizing coumarin and BODIPY fluorophores, by introducing a benzene to reduce dihedral angles and a methyl group to inhibit intramolecular rotation, enabling specific polarity response. It has a broad linear response and strong anti&#8208;interference, quantifies ER micro&#8208;polarity via dual&#8208;channel and lambda mode imaging, captures ER micro&#8208;polarity changes under stress and hippocampal regional differences, and its notable lifetime variations with micro&#8208;polarity changes endow MBDP with FLIM capability.








ABSTRACT
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) micro&#8208;polarity, with its spatial heterogeneity and dynamic changes, regulates key physiological processes like protein folding and lipid metabolism. Its abnormal alterations under pathological conditions, such as oxidative stress are closely linked to metabolic diseases and tumors. Capturing these subtle dynamics to reveal connections with organelle dysfunction remains a critical challenge. Existing traditional physical approaches are complex and cannot achieve real&#8208;time spatial imaging. Fluorescent probes for polarity sensing could provide spatiotemporal resolution, nevertheless, suffer from unstable signals due to nonfixed dual channels, narrow response ranges, interference from viscosity, and nonlinear responses, hindering quantitative monitoring. We designed an ER&#8208;targeted probe MBDP via hybridizing coumarin and BODIPY fluorophores, by introducing a benzene to reduce dihedral angles and a methyl group to inhibit intramolecular rotation, enabling specific polarity response. It shows a broad linear response, strong anti&#8208;interference ability, which quantifies ER micro&#8208;polarity via dual&#8208;channel and lambda mode imaging. It captures ER micro&#8208;polarity changes under stress and hippocampal regional differences. Moreover, the remarkable lifetime variations upon polarity change endow MBDP capability under fluorescence lifetime imaging microscope (FLIM). This probe provides a powerful tool with ratiometric imaging and FLIM dual&#8208;modal monitoring for ER micro&#8208;polarity, aiding in revealing ER&#8208;related physiological/pathological mechanisms and disease research.

Syntheses and base pairing properties of halogenated hypoxanthine nucleosides with 8&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deazapurine skeleton (dI*) are reported. Single X&#8208;ray analyses disclosed unit cells connected by a wobble base pair and consisting of two conformers in high&#8208;anti conformation with N&#8208;type or E&#8208;type sugar puckering. For single incorporations, duplex stability followed the order dI*&#8208;dC = dI*&#8208;dA &gt; dI*&#8208;dT &gt; dI*&#8208;dG. Consecutive incorporations of halogenated dI*&#8208;dC, dI*&#8208;dG, and dI*&#8208;dA base pairs gave stable duplexes, whereas hybridization of dI* with dT failed.








ABSTRACT
Syntheses and base pairing properties of halogenated and nonhalogenated hypoxanthine nucleosides with 8&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deazapurine skeleton (dI*) are reported. Modified hypoxanthine nucleosides were accessed from 6&#8208;alkoxy precursors. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analyses disclosed unit cells consisting of two conformers adopting high&#8208;anti conformation around the glycosylic bond with N&#8208;type C3&#8217;&#8208;endo (3T2) or E&#8208;type, O4&#8217;&#8208;endo (0E) sugar puckering. Crystal packing is stabilized by inosine/inosine wobble base pairs as well as intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonds. Hirshfeld surface analyses confirmed these findings. Halogenated and nonhalogenated dI* nucleosides were converted to phosphoramidites and applied to solid&#8208;phase oligonucleotide synthesis. Single and consecutive incorporations were accomplished and Watson&#8211;Crick and purine&#8211;purine base pairing was investigated. Single incorporations opposite to canonical nucleosides afforded stable duplexes in all cases. Tm values revealed the following order of stability dI*&#8208;dC = dI*&#8208;dA &gt; dI*&#8208;dT &gt; dI*&#8208;dG. Consecutive incorporations furnished more distinguished results. Double helices with halogenated dI*&#8208;dC base pairs were the most stable ones, whereas hybridization for dI* opposite to dT was hindered. Halogenated dI*&#8208;dG and dI*&#8208;dA purine&#8208;purine base pairs gave stable duplexes, whereas hybridization of nonhalogenated dI*&#8208;dA pairs failed. From CD spectra, helical changes for duplexes with three dI*&#8208;dG purine&#8208;purine base pairs were detected. All other duplexes showed the typical shape of a B&#8208;DNA.

         <title>Synthesis and Isolation of Bismuth Scorpionate Complexes: Toward Bond Activation via Bismuth&#8208;Ligand Cooperation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
Over the past twenty years, main group chemistry has significantly expanded its scope to include reactivities once considered the exclusive domain of transition metals. Among the emerging concepts, element&#8208;ligand cooperation has proven to be a powerful strategy for enabling bond activation reactions but remains relatively unexplored for heavier group 15 elements. In this study, we present a novel class of ylide ligands incorporating additional amino donor sites, specifically designed to promote bismuth&#8208;ligand cooperativity. We successfully isolated a series of well&#8208;defined bismuth scorpionate complexes supported by these dianionic N,Cylide,N ligands, each bearing different substituents at the ylide moiety. These variations modulate the degree of negative charge stabilization, thereby tuning the extent of electron donation to the bismuth center. Halide abstraction generated cationic bismuth complexes, which exhibited enhanced ligand&#8208;to&#8208;bismuth electron donation, resulting in low Lewis acidities and reduced reactivity. In contrast, deprotonation of the ylide ligand bearing an electron&#8208;withdrawing ArF substituent enabled the synthesis and NMR characterization of a rare bismuth yldiide complex. This yldiide underwent a [2 + 2] addition with a carbodiimide across the formal Bi = C double bond, demonstrating that bismuth yldiides can engage in bond activation through bismuth&#8208;ligand cooperativity.

         <title>Effective and Selective Hydrogenation of Methyl Acrylate to Methyl Propionate on Single&#8208;Atom Nickel Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Development of highly efficient, selective, and stable single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) is an important research hotspot in the field of hydrogenation, due to the atomic utilization of active component. In this study, an effective single&#8208;atom nickel catalyst with a specific coordination structure of Ni&#9472;N4 was constructed using Ni&#8208;containing ZIF&#8208;8 as precursor for efficient hydrogenation of methyl acrylate to methyl propionate in the fixed&#8208;bed reactor. Multiple characterization techniques including HAADF&#8208;STEM, H2&#8208;TPR, XRD, and XAFS were utilized to systematically analyze the structure and physicochemical properties of as&#8208;prepared catalyst series. The effects of catalyst preparation and hydrogenation conditions on the catalytic performance were evaluated and further optimized. As a result, the turn of frequency (TOF) could reach up to 200.8 h&#8722;1 for methyl propionate production, with catalytic selectivity of 100%. In situ IR experiments were performed to monitor the hydrogenation mechanism on the catalyst surface, as well as kinetic studies for confirmation of reaction order and activation barrier. This study will provide a new strategy for the design and of non&#8208;noble metal SAC for the hydrogenation of methyl acrylate.

         <title>Light&#8208;controlled 1D to 2D 2,3&#8208;Diaminophenazine Self&#8208;assembly Transformation on Cu(111) Surface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel on&#8208;surface transformation from 1D to 2D self&#8208;assembly is achieved. This work demonstrates the feasibility of a series of reactions that are conventionally thermally prohibited due to their entropy&#8208;driven amorphization tendency. The specific stimuli&#8208;selective pathway enables precise molecular control in the field of self&#8208;assembly.








Abstract
Controlled molecular self&#8208;assembly enables precise engineering of nanomaterials with programmable dimensionality and functionality. Conventional thermal&#8208;driven approaches, however, often struggle to achieve structural complexity due to weak intermolecular interactions and entropy&#8208;driven disorder at elevated temperatures. Here, we introduce a light&#8208;controlled methodology to realize a dimensionality transformation of carbon nitride&#8208;based architectures on a Cu(111) surface, bypassing the limitations of thermal processing. By applying ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation, we achieve the controlled conversion of 1D self&#8208;assembled nanoribbons of 2,3&#8208;diaminophenazine (DAP), a carbon nitride precursor, into ordered 2D extended frameworks. This light&#8208;driven 1D&#8208;to&#8208;2D structural evolution starkly contrasts with thermal treatments, which exclusively produce disordered aggregates under comparable conditions. Remarkably, this transformation proceeds without requiring light&#8208;reactive chemicals, underscoring the unique capability of UV light to direct molecular reorganization at interfaces. The work establishes a paradigm for manipulating nanoscale dimensionality in carbon nitride systems, circumventing conventional entropy limitations and offering a versatile platform for designing advanced 2D functional materials with applications in photocatalysis, nanoelectronics, and surface&#8208;supported molecular engineering.

         <title>Eco&#8208;Friendly Synthesis of Cobalt Phthalocyanine for High&#8208;Efficiency CO2${\rm CO}_{2}$ Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable synthesis of cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) using low&#8208;impact solvents yields high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts with reduced waste (E&#8208;factor 18.6). When integrated into gas diffusion electrodes, CoPc achieves up to 12% Faradays efficiency for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;methanol and 65% CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion, aligning with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art materials and enabling greener CO2 reduction (CO2RR).








ABSTRACT
We report a sustainable and cost&#8208;effective synthesis of cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) using low&#8208;impact solvents and a streamlined purification procedure, achieving an 85% yield with limited waste generation, as indicated by an environmental factor (E&#8208;factor) of 18.6. This route provides an eco&#8208;friendly approach to producing a molecular electrocatalyst for CO2${\rm CO}_{2}$ reduction. The catalytic activity of the synthesized CoPc is validated by its integration into a gas diffusion electrode with carbon nanotube supports, exhibiting methanol production with a Faradaic efficiency up to 12%, matching the values reached with the conventionally synthesized counterparts. Notably, under high loading (micrometric crystallites of CoPc), CO2${\rm CO}_{2}$&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion reached 65%, in fair alignment with literature benchmarks. Our work shows that green synthesis can yield high&#8208;performance catalysts for CO2${\rm CO}_{2}$ electrochemical reduction (CO2RR${\rm CO}_{2}{\rm RR}$), enabling sustainable methanol&#160;production.

         <title>Azulene in a Bowl: A Nonalternant Buckybowl With 5/7 Topology, Azulene&#8208;Derived Properties, and Fullerene Complexation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first azulene&#8208;based buckybowl with a distinctive 5/7 ring topology has been synthesized and thoroughly characterized, demonstrating the ability to assemble with fullerene C60 or C70. The incorporation of the nonalternant azulene unit endows this novel buckybowl with unique electronic and photophysical properties, including a narrow HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap, red&#8208;shifted UV&#8208;vis absorption, anti&#8208;Kasha emission, and reversible proton&#8208;responsive behavior.








ABSTRACT
Despite the intriguing potential of azulene&#8208;embedded nanocarbons, their integration into curved buckybowl architectures has remained unexplored due to synthetic and stability challenges. Herein, we report an azulene&#8208;containing buckybowl 6, synthesized via a concise four&#8208;step route where the azulene core remains stable without rearrangement to naphthalene. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis revealed that 6 adopts a nonalternant, bowl&#8208;shaped geometric configuration. Unlike classical buckybowls (e.g., corannulene, dibenzo[a,g]corannulene, and summane), 6 exhibits distinct azulene&#8208;derived properties: red&#8208;shifted UV&#8208;vis absorption, anti&#8208;Kasha photoluminescence, and reversible proton&#8208;responsive behavior. Theoretical studies reveal unique aromaticity in its central pentagon, diverging from known pentagon&#8208;containing buckybowls. Furthermore, it was found that buckybowl 6 can assemble with fullerene C60 or C70 in a 1:1 stoichiometry. This work establishes 6 as the unique azulene&#8208;based buckybowl and pioneers a design strategy for nonalternant, positively curved &#960;&#8208;systems with 5/7 ring topologies and tunable optoelectronic properties.

         <title>Latest Progress on Synchronous Removal of Multiple Heavy Metal Cations and Anions: Adsorbent Design and Mechanism Elucidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
The development of highly efficient remediation technologies for heavy metal pollution has attracted widespread attention. Due to the &#8220;trade&#8208;off&#8221; effect arising from the different occurrence states and physical&#8208;chemical properties of heavy metal cations and anions in the different pH environments, the remediation of coexisting multiple heavy metal contamination is significantly complex and challenging. As such, the investigation of highly selective and efficient adsorbents for multiple heavy metals removal is the present focus of the scientific and industrial community. Under such circumstances, we report the latest progress on multiple heavy metals removal in this review. Firstly, we summarize the current situation of heavy metal contamination and the corresponding remediation methods. Secondly, we divide the discussion into three sections, including the heavy metal cation removal, heavy metal anion removal, and the coexisting multiple heavy metal removal from the perspective of removal mechanisms and the used adsorbents. Finally, we highlight the future challenges and opportunities in the development of promising adsorbents for multiple heavy metals removal.

         <title>A Versatile System of Solvent, Catalyst, and Ligand for Challenging Biphenyl Synthesis Through Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions with electron&#8208;deficient haloarenes and electron&#8208;deficient areneboronic acids proceed with moderate to excellent yields in N&#8208;methylpyrrolidone as solvent, Pd(dba)3 as catalyst, CuI as cocatalyst, and Davephos as ligand.








ABSTRACT
Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions are difficult when both reaction partners (boronic acid and halide) are electron&#8208;poor. We describe here a system of solvent, catalyst, and ligand with which also electron&#8208;poor substrates react, without the necessity to try several conditions. The system consists of N&#8208;methylpyrrolidone as solvent, tris(dibenzylidenaceton)dipalladium(0) as catalyst, CuI as cocatalyst, and Davephos as ligand. This combination yields little or no Ullmann product, and the desired cross&#8208;coupling product is in moderate to excellent yields.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of 2D Metal&#8208;Organic Framework as an Efficient Heterogeneous Catalyst for the Epoxidation of Olefin With H2O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using the sacrificial template method, metal porphyrin was attached in situ to the ZnO surface to prepare surfactant&#8208;free, highly dispersed Zn&#8208;TCPP(Mn)/ZnO, which had a positive effect on the stability and activity of the catalyst. Notably, styrene underwent complete conversion within 20 min, with an impressive epoxide selectivity reaching 97%, and exhibits a remarkable conversion frequency of 1980 h&#8722;1. More significantly, the composite catalyst Zn&#8208;TCPP(Mn)/ZnO exhibits a structurally stable framework and maintains a substantial level of catalytic activity even after undergoing five consecutive cycles. Meanwhile, other substrates exhibited varying degrees of selectivity, ranging from moderate to commendable.








ABSTRACT
The 2D ultrathin MOF nanosheets, which effectively integrate metals and functional ligands, possess the advantageous features of molecular catalysts and exhibit remarkable catalytic activity in multiphase catalysis. Herein, we employed the sacrificial template method to achieve in situ attachment of metalloporphyrin onto a ZnO substrate, resulting in the formation of surfactant&#8208;free 2D dispersed structures of Zn&#8208;TCPP(Mn)/ZnO. The multilayered stacked B&#8208;Zn&#8208;TCPP(Mn) (3D) blocks were prepared by growing Zn2+ mixed with metalloporphyrin as a comparison. The novel composite catalyst Zn&#8208;TCPP(Mn)/ZnO was employed for the efficient epoxidation of various alkenes using H2O2 as an oxidant at ambient temperatures. Notably, alkenes conversion within 20 min achieves a high yield and impressive 1980 h&#8722;1 turnover frequency. The composite catalyst can still maintain its structural integrity after undergoing five consecutive cycles, and the total yield of oxidized styrene is slightly reduced. This was confirmed by a series of characterization analyses and other assessments. Additionally, comparative experiments revealed that the B&#8208;Zn&#8208;TCPP(Mn) blocks underwent partial exfoliation into 2D nanosheets following the catalytic reaction, thereby enhancing the catalytic conversion efficiency in subsequent epoxidation reactions. This finding provides compelling evidence for the heightened catalytic activity of 2D materials.

         <title>Enantioselective Assembly of Si&#8208;Stereogenic Sila&#8208;[1,4]oxazines via Sequential Si&#9472;O/Si&#9472;C Dehydrocoupling</title>

         <dc:description>
An iridium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective dehydrogenative coupling for synthesizing silicon&#8208;stereogenic sila&#8208;[1,4]oxazines is reported. This method directly constructs Si&#8208;stereogenic centers with high enantioselectivity, offering new avenues for silicon&#8208;containing heterocycles.








ABSTRACT
Silacycles have shown great promise in medicinal chemistry, agrochemistry, and materials science. In this study, we report an efficient iridium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective dehydrogenative coupling of pyrrolo&#8208;phenol derivatives with dihydrosilanes, which leads to the synthesis of Si&#8208;stereogenic sila&#8208;[1,4]oxazines with excellent enantioselectivity. This method successfully integrates silicon into the bioactive [1,4]oxazine framework, broadening the application scope of silicon&#8208;containing heterocycles. Mechanistic studies indicate a two&#8208;step sequence: an enantioselective Ir&#8208;catalyzed Si&#9472;O dehydrocoupling, followed by an intramolecular Si&#9472;C coupling.

         <title>Observation of Quinoxalinyl Radical Produced by Muonium Addition to 1,2&#8208;Diisocyanobenzene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This muon spectroscopic study analyzed a 1,2&#8208;diisocyanobenzene derivative, which led to the isocyanide insertion process. The transverse&#8208;field muon spin rotation (TF&#8208;&#181;SR) measurements observed the quinoxalinyl radical, and the imidoyl radical did not appear due to the prompt cyclization occurring faster than the muon timescale. The &#181;SR&#8208;characterized paramagnetic species was an aryl &#963; radical, exhibiting the corresponding high reactivity in the THF (tetrahydrofuran) solution.








ABSTRACT
Radical isocyanide (isonitrile) insertion reactions have advanced considerably, yet the nature of the underlying paramagnetic intermediates remains poorly understood. We previously studied the isocyanide insertion of muonium (Mu), a light isotope of hydrogen, into 2&#8208;isocyano&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyls by transverse field muon spin rotation (TF&#8208;&#181;SR) spectroscopy and characterized the resulting radical, which was identified as an imidoyl radical. The cyclized product was not observed on the microsecond timescale. To gain deeper insight, we now report TF&#8208;&#181;SR spectra of 1,2&#8208;diisocyano&#8208;3,4,5,6&#8208;tetramethylbenzene in both THF solution and the crystalline state. A single muoniated radical species was observed, displaying an unusually small muon hyperfine coupling constant (hfc). Guided by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we identified this species as a quinoxalinyl radical, formed via intramolecular cyclization of the imidoyl intermediate. This observation implies that the imidoyl radical survives only on the nanosecond timescale before cyclization.

         <title>Rational Construction and Design of CoTi&#8208;NiTi/TNO Species by Pulsed&#8208;Laser Irradiation for Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>

ABSTRACT
Hydrogen is a renewable and environmentally friendly energy carrier and is regarded a viable alternative to fossil fuels. Consequently, developing electrodes with excellent hydrogen evolution electrocatalysis is a top priority in research. In this regard, the CoTi&#8208;NiTi/TNO electrode was synthesized through a single&#8208;step laser method in a nitrogen atmosphere utilizing precursors infused with Co and Ni. Importantly, the CoTi&#8208;NiTi/TNO||IrO2 electrolyzer demonstrated excellent water&#8208;splitting efficiency, reaching a voltage of 1.5&#160;V at a current density of 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 0.5&#160;M H2SO4, surpassing the commercial Pt/C||IrO2 configuration, which only achieved 1.5&#160;V at a current density of 22&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Importantly, the CoTi&#8208;NiTi/TNO||IrO2 displayed a remarkable stability that operated at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for over 48&#160;h without significant decay. The laser&#8208;induced annealing approach offers several advantages. These include the prevention of particle aggregation, an increase in yield, a reduction in processing time, and potentially lower energy consumption.

Planar (D5h) and pyramidal (C5v) dianionic clusters, SeM5X52&#8722; (M = LiK; X = FBr), showcase pentacoordinate selenium atoms stabilized by geometric confinement and electrostatic interactions with surrounding alkali and halogen atoms.








Abstract
A systematic computational exploration of the dianionic systems SeM5X52&#8722; (M&#160;=&#160;Li&#9472;Cs; X&#160;=&#160;F&#9472;I) was conducted to evaluate the viability of planar pentacoordinate selenium (ppSe). Of the twenty combinations considered, 10 adopt planar or pyramidal structures, with four corresponding to true global minima containing a ppSe center. Bonding analysis and magnetic response calculations show that the stabilization of ppSe arrangements in these dianions results mainly from geometric confinement and strong electrostatic interactions between selenium and the surrounding alkali metal and halogen atoms. Unlike planar hypercoordinate systems stabilized by delocalized bonding or aromaticity, the dianions studied here display highly localized electronic structures, expanding the scope of nonclassical bonding motifs in main&#8208;group chemistry.

         <title>Proton Conductive Supramolecular Architectures Based on a Cobalt Terpyridine&#8211;Biimidazole Complex: Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Hexamer and Mixed&#8208;Valence 1D Chain</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded cobalt(II/III) coordination complexes incorporating 2,2&#8242;&#8208;biimidazole and COOH&#8208;terpyridine ligands were synthesized, forming a hexameric cluster [1]6 and a rare mixed&#8208;valence 1D chain [2]n. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks and 1D channels. [1]6 exhibited high proton conductivity (1.0 &#215; 10&#8722;2 S cm&#8722;1, 358 K, 100% RH), showing promise as a proton&#8208;conducting material.








ABSTRACT
Despite extensive research on hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks, cobalt&#8208;based coordination complexes with biimidazole ligands remain largely unexplored, and their potential as proton&#8208;conducting materials has not been comprehensively investigated. Therefore, this paper reports the synthesis, crystal structures, and proton conduction properties of novel hydrogen&#8208;bonded cobalt(II/III) coordination complexes incorporating 2,2&#8242;&#8208;biimidazole (H2bim) and 4&#8242;&#8208;carboxyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8243;&#8208;terpyridine (COOH&#8208;terpy) ligands. Two supramolecular architectures were obtained via ligand exchange reactions in methanol: a hydrogen&#8208;bonded hexamer, {CoIII(COO&#8208;terpy)(H2bim)(SCN)}6 ([1]6), and a mixed&#8208;valence 1D hydrogen&#8208;bonded chain, {[CoII(COO&#8208;terpy)(H2bim)(NCS)][CoIII(COO&#8208;terpy)(H2bim)(SCN)]}n ([2]n). Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed that both structures feature extensive hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks involving carboxylate and H2bim ligands, leading to unique porous architectures with 1D channels accommodating lattice solvents. Thermogravimetric and variable&#8208;temperature powder X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses demonstrated the thermal stability and reversible hydration behavior of [1]6. AC impedance measurements under 100% relative humidity revealed high proton conductivity in [1]6, reaching 1.0 &#215; 10&#8722;2 S cm&#8722;1 at 358 K, attributable to proton transport facilitated by hydrogen&#8208;bonded networks and lattice water molecules. Activation energy analysis suggested a vehicle mechanism for proton conduction. Overall, this study highlights the potential of hydrogen&#8208;bonded cobalt complexes incorporating biimidazole ligands as promising proton&#8208;conducting materials with tunable supramolecular architectures.

         <title>Advanced Microsphere and Hydrogel Platforms for Precision Interventional Therapy of Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
Interventional management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains hindered by profound tumor heterogeneity and an immunosuppressive microenvironment. While transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) constitutes the current standard of care, its therapeutic efficacy is compromised by burst drug release, incomplete vascular occlusion, and systemic toxicity. Emerging advanced biomaterial platforms&#8212;microspheres and hydrogels&#8212;are redefining this paradigm by enabling precise spatial and temporal control over embolization and drug delivery. Microspheres provide hierarchical vascular occlusion and sustained release through tunable size and mechanical properties, addressing the limitations of conventional lipiodol formulations. Hydrogels offer exceptional injectability, high payload capacity, and conformal filling of irregular cavities, thereby facilitating controlled intratumoral release and microenvironment modulation. Beyond embolization, these systems integrate seamlessly with multimodal therapies&#8212;including magnetic hyperthermia, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy&#8212;delivering synergistic &#8220;embolization&#8211;therapy&#8211;diagnosis&#8221; functionality. Incorporation of stimuli&#8208;responsive motifs, imaging agents, and immunomodulators further enables localized ablation, reversal of immunosuppression, and induction of systemic antitumor immunity to suppress metastasis and recurrence. Despite encouraging preclinical outcomes, clinical translation faces challenges in biocompatibility, scalable fabrication, and standardized evaluation. This review highlights design strategies for next&#8208;generation embolic materials that integrate precision embolization, multimodal imaging, and immune reprogramming, thereby advancing interventional HCC therapy toward intelligent and personalized solutions.

         <title>Synthetic Mimics of Serine Proteases via Covalent Imprinting of Photo&#8208;Protected Template Molecules for Aryl Amide Hydrolysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2&#8208;Aminobenzyl alcohol in solution uses its more nucleophilic amino group to react with an activated ester in the transacylation. Only inside a custom&#8208;designed active site do the same functional groups mimic serine protease by catalytically hydrolyzing not only activated esters but also aryl amides with substrate selectivity.








ABSTRACT
The rational design of enzyme&#8208;mimicking catalysts remains in its early stages. Beyond the controversies surrounding the origin of the catalytic efficiency found in enzyme catalysis, a large challenge lies in the synthetic construction of multifunctional active sites with precisely positioned binding and catalytic groups. Here, we present a rational strategy to create serine protease&#8208;mimicking molecularly imprinted nanoparticles (MINPs) via covalent imprinting within cross&#8208;linkable micelles, followed by photo&#8208;deprotection of the polymerized template molecules. Unlike previously reported protease mimics that work on activated ester substrates, the MINP&#8208;based catalysts are able to hydrolyze aryl amides under mild conditions. In addition, substrate selectivity can be finely tuned through the modular design of the template molecules.

         <title>Enhancing G&#8208;Quadruplex Binding: Rational Design and Biophysical Evaluation of Dimeric Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescence thermal shift assays, electrospray ionization&#8208;mass spectrometry, CD spectroscopy, molecular modeling and cytotoxicity assays were enrolled to study the binding of a rationally designed anthraquinone&#8208;based G&#8208;quadruplex binder interacting with the nucleic acid as a molecular tweezer.








ABSTRACT
G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) are non&#8208;canonical nucleic acid structures formed by guanine&#8208;rich sequences. Within the human genome, beyond telomeres, G4 motifs have also been found in promoters, implying a potential role in gene regulation that could be achieved through interactions with small&#8208;molecule ligands. In this field, anthraquinone represented a privileged scaffold for the design of G4&#8208;targeting molecules. Additionally, emerging evidence proved that compounds bearing two aromatic cores can offer enhanced affinity and selectivity toward G4s due to cooperative binding in a tweezer&#8208;like fashion. This study reports the rational design and synthesis of anthraquinone&#8208;based building blocks conceived to generate a dimeric ligand connected through a flexible polyethylene glycol (PEG) linker to potentially recognize G4 as molecular tweezers. The interaction of the synthesized compounds with G4 structures has been investigated by biophysical techniques, including fluorescence thermal shift assays, electrospray ionization&#8208;mass spectrometry and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, supported by molecular modeling studies. Finally, cytotoxicity assays were performed to evaluate the antiproliferative effects of the new ligands.

         <title>Biocatalytic Strategies for the Synthesis of Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atropisomeric scaffolds are important building blocks in natural products, organocatalysts, metal ligands, and functional materials. This review introduces current developments for synthesizing atropisomers employing biocatalytic kinetic resolution, dynamic kinetic resolution, and desymmetrization strategies.








ABSTRACT
The asymmetric synthesis of atropisomers has garnered extensive attention in recent years. Atropisomers constitute a key structural motif in natural products, chiral ligands, organocatalysts, and functional materials. Despite progress driven by transition&#8208;metal and organocatalysis, inherent limitations in enantioselectivity and sustainability have hampered further development in this field. Alternatively, biocatalysis offers a promising solution employing strategies including (dynamic) kinetic resolution, desymmetrization, and other strategies. These biocatalytic processes operate under mild, environmentally friendly conditions, achieving high stereoselectivity that is often difficult to attain with traditional methods. This review highlights recent advances in the biocatalytic synthesis of atropisomers and offer insights in the development of the relevant field.

         <title>Delivery Routes of Topical Eyedrops Reaching the Posterior Segment of the Eye&#8208;Recent Advances</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizs recent advances in topical eyedrop therapies for ocular fundus diseases, with a focus on their delivery routes and mechanisms by which they reach the posterior segment of eye.The formulations based on the corneal route include emulsomes and dual&#8208;transmembrane peptides, those based on the conjunctival route include PepT&#8208;1 ligands and cell&#8208;penetrating peptides, and those based on dual routes include chitosan, polymer micelles and supramolecular peptides.








ABSTRACT
Current topical eyedrop treatments for posterior segment diseases face significant challenges, including rapid tear clearance and ocular barrier limitations, which hinder effective drug delivery to target tissues in the posterior segment. To date, no eyedrop formulation has been clinically approved for the treatment of ocular fundus diseases. Eyedrops reach the posterior segment via two primary routes: the corneal route and the conjunctival routes, the latter comprising the conjunctival&#8211;vasculature route and the conjunctival&#8211;scleral route. This review summarizes recent advances in topical eyedrop therapies for ocular fundus diseases, with a focus on their delivery routes and the mechanisms by which they reach the posterior segment of eye. The cell&#8208;penetrating homing peptides and lipid nanoparticle&#8208;encapsulated eyedrops primarily reach the posterior segment via the corneal route; cell&#8208;penetrating peptides and PepT&#8208;1&#8208;targeting ligands mainly utilize the conjunctival route; whereas chitosan nanoparticles, polymeric micelles, and supramolecular peptide&#8208;based eyedrops can access the posterior segment via both routes. By systematically clarifying the pathways and mechanisms by which eyedrops formulations traverse ocular barriers, this review aims to provide a rational foundation for future research and development in posterior segment drug delivery.

         <title>Structural Control of RNA Demethylation: G&#8208;Quadruplex Proximity Suppresses ALKBH5 Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
RNA G&#8208;quadruplex structures significantly affected the m6A demethylation activity of the RNA demethylase, ALKBH5. The suppression was apparent when m6A was near G&#8208;tetrad cores, and not within the flexible loops. The G&#8208;quadruplex ligand induced G&#8208;quadruplex structure to RNA and suppressed ALKBH5 demethylation activity to nearby m6A. These results suggest that G&#8208;quadruplex RNA serves as a regulatory element in epitranscriptome regulation.








ABSTRACT
RNA modifications and higher&#8208;order structures function as regulatory layers of RNA metabolism beyond sequence context. However, their interplay remains largely unexplored. Among RNA modifications, N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant internal modification in mRNAs, regulated by writer, reader, and eraser proteins; the AlkB family dioxygenases, AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5), and fat mass&#8208; and obesity&#8208;associated protein (FTO). In addition, G&#8208;quadruplex RNA is a representative structure involved in key biological processes. This study investigated how G&#8208;quadruplex structures influence the demethylation efficiency of m6A erasers. Using RNAs with m6A positioned adjacent to the G&#8208;tetrad core or within a flexible loop of G&#8208;quadruplex structures, we showed that G&#8208;quadruplex formation markedly suppressed ALKBH5 activity compared with FTO, particularly when m6A was near the G&#8208;tetrad core, such as the HIV&#8208;1 U3&#8208;region G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;forming sequence. Conversely, m6A within a long, flexible loop, remained accessible to ALKBH5. The G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;specific ligand BRACO19, which stabilizes G&#8208;quadruplex structures, further confirmed the structural sensitivity of ALKBH5. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate a direct link between G&#8208;quadruplex structures and m6A eraser protein activity. These findings highlight the importance of the RNA structural context in regulating m6A erasers and suggest that G&#8208;quadruplexes may serve as regulatory elements in epitranscriptomic control.
