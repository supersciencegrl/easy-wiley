      <title>A&#160;Six&#8211;Armed Phenhomazine Ligand with a Potential &#8220;Turn&#8211;Off&#8221; Copper(II) Sensing Capability through Terbium(III) Luminescence Quenching</title>
      <dc:description>Herein we describe the design, synthesis and characterization of a phenhomazine ligand with six pendant acetate arms designed for the combined coordination of copper(II) and lanthanide(III) ions, with the perspective of the development of a &#8220;turn&#8211;off&#8221; copper sensor. The key step for the ligand preparation was the one&#8211;step endomethylene bridge fission of a diamino Tr&#246;ger&#8217;s base with a concomitant alkylation. Fluorescence and absorption spectroscopies as well as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments were performed in order to analyze and understand the coordination properties of the ligand. Transition metal coordination was driven by the synergistic effect of the free nitrogen atoms of the diazocinic core and the two central acetate arms attached to those nitrogens, whereas lanthanide coordination is performed by external acetate arms, presumably forming a self&#8211;assembled 2:2 metallosupramolecular structure. The terbium complex shows the typical green emission with narrow bands and long luminescence lifetimes. The luminescence quenching produced by the presence of copper(II) ions was analyzed. This work sets therefore a starting point for the development of a phenhomazine&#8211;based &#8220;turn&#8211;off&#8221; copper(II) sensor.</dc:description>

      <title>An NMR&#8208;based biosensor to measure stereo&#8208;specific methionine sulfoxide reductase (MSR) activities in vitro and in vivo.</title>
      <dc:description>Oxidation of protein methionines to methionine&#8208;sulfoxides (MetOx) is associated with several age&#8208;related diseases. In healthy cells, MetOx is reduced to methionine by two families of conserved methionine sulfoxide reductase enzymes, MSRA and MSRB that specifically target the  S  &#8208; or  R  &#8208;diastereoisomers of methionine&#8208;sulfoxides, respectively.

      <title>Ultrabright terbium nanoparticles for FRET biosensing and in&#8208;situ imaging of epidermal growth factor receptors</title>
      <dc:description>Lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoparticles (LnNPs) have become an important class of fluorophores for advanced biosensing and bioimaging. LnNPs that are photosensitized by surface&#8208;attached antenna ligands can possess exceptional brightness. However, their functional bioconjugation remains an important challenge for their translation into bioanalytical applications. To solve this problem, we designed a ligand that can be simultaneously applied as efficient light harvesting antenna for Tb surface ions and strong linker of biomolecules to the LnNPs surfaces. To demonstrate generic applicability of the photosensitized TbNP&#8208;bioconjugates, we applied them in two prototypical applications for biosensing and bioimaging. First, in&#8208;solution biorecognition was shown by time&#8208;resolved F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between streptavidin&#8208;functionalized TbNPs to biotinylated dyes (ATTO 610). Second, in&#8208;situ detection of ligand&#8208;receptor binding on cells was accomplished with TbNP&#8208;antibody (Matuzumab) conjugates that could specifically bind to transmembrane epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR). High specificity and sensitivity were demonstrated by time&#8208;gated imaging of EGFR on both strongly (A431) and weakly (HeLa and Cos7) EGFR&#8208;expressing cell lines, whereas non&#8208;expressing cell lines (NIH3T3) and EGFR&#8208;passivated A431 cells did not show any signals. Despite the relatively large size of TbNP&#8208;antibody conjugates, they could be internalized by A431 cells upon binding to extracellular EGFR, which showed their potential as bright and stable luminescence markers for intracellular signalling.</dc:description>

      <title>Frontispiece: A Sunscreen&#8208;Based Photocage for Carbonyl Groups</title>
      <dc:description>
New photolabile protecting group (PPG) for the organic chemist toolbox is described herein. The concept of sunscreen&#8208;based photocages is explored for photoprotection and controlled release of carbonyl compounds.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;New photolabile protecting group (PPG) for the organic chemist toolbox &lt;/b&gt; is described herein. The concept of sunscreen&#8208;based photocages is explored for photoprotection and controlled release of carbonyl compounds. In this context, the commercial UVA/UVB filter oxybenzone not only acts as a mere PPG, but also provides, once released, UV photoprotection to the carbonyl derivative. This design points to a possible therapeutic approach to reduce the severe photoadverse effects of drugs containing a carbonyl chromophore. For more information, see the Full Paper of M.&#8197;A.

      <title>Reactions in Water Involving the &#8220;On&#8208;Water&#8221; Mechanism</title>
      <dc:description>
Like oil and water: Ever&#8208;evolving advances in water&#8208;compatible catalysts have enriched the current understanding of sustainable organic chemistry, nevertheless, the lack of a clearly defined classification system has led to confusion. In addition to the definition of words and proposed model of &#8220;on&#8208;water&#8221; mechanism, recent examples of reactions accelerated in water are herein discussed.







Abstract
Ever&#8208;evolving catalyst advances in synthetic protocols using water as a reaction medium have enriched the understanding of sustainable organic chemistry. Because conventional classification and definitions were ambivalent, it is proposed here that catalytic reactions using water be collectively called to be &#8220;in water&#8221;, with further classification into seven types. When accelerated in water as heterogeneous mixtures, the reactions can be regarded as following an &#8220;on&#8208;water&#8221; mechanism. The original term &#8220;on water&#8221; coined by Sharpless is incongruous with catalytic reactions, whereas on&#8208;water used in this review covers all the interfaces involving water where chemical reactions are accelerated. As a result of the unconcluded dispute on the antiquated catalyst&#8208;free &#8220;on water&#8221; model, the modified model defines three water layers: water molecules that are oriented to extrude protons toward the oil phase in the inner layer, those enwrapped by a secondary layer, and finally the bulk water layer. In light of the latitudinous outlook on the role of water at the interface, selected examples of reactions, in particular those reported over the past decade, that follow an &#8220;on&#8208;water&#8221; mechanism are reviewed herein.

      <title>The Macrocycle versus Chain Competition in On&#8208;Surface Polymerization: Insights from Reactions of 1,3&#8208;Dibromoazulene on Cu(111)</title>
      <dc:description>
The competition between macrocycle and chain formation in organometallic on&#8208;surface polymerization can be steered by variation of coverage and temperature. The entropically favored chains are preferentially formed under non&#8208;equilibrium conditions and high coverage, whereas the more stable macrocycles prevail when the on&#8208;surface synthesis is performed in equilibrium at low coverages.







Abstract
Ring/chain competition in oligomerization reactions represents a long&#8208;standing topic of synthetic chemistry and was treated extensively for solution reactions but is not well&#8208;understood for the two&#8208;dimensional confinement of surface reactions. Here, the kinetic and thermodynamic principles of ring/chain competition in on&#8208;surface synthesis are addressed by scanning tunneling microscopy, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Monte Carlo simulations applied to azulene&#8208;based organometallic oligomers on Cu(111). Analysis of experiments and simulations reveals how the ring/chain ratio can be controlled through variation of coverage and temperature. At room temperature, non&#8208;equilibrium conditions prevail and kinetic control leads to preferential formation of the entropically favored chains. In contrast, high&#8208;temperature equilibrium conditions are associated with thermodynamic control, resulting in increased yields of the energetically favored rings. The optimum conditions for ring formation include the lowest possible temperature within the regime of thermodynamic control and a low coverage. The general implications are discussed and compared to the solution case.

      <dc:description>
The cover image illustrates a card game based on phosphorus and boron. The Joker card is the title compound 1&#8208;phospha&#8208;7&#8208;bora&#8208;norbornadiene. This card is wild and its behavior depends on the compound card it is played on.

The divergent reactivity of the title compound resembles that of a frustrated Lewis pairs (FLP). More information can be found in the Full Paper by R.&#8197;M. Gschwind, C. M&#252;ller, J.&#8197;C.

The photoinduced pyramidal inversion behavior of phosphanes has been investigated in this work. The cover artwork describes the photoinduced inversion behavior of a single phosphane. Various spectral measurements and theoretical computational analyses showed that the pyramidal inversion was accelerated in the excited state.

      <dc:description>
Bidirectional syntheses of C2&#8208;symmetrical intermediates is an important concept for constructing stereochemical scaffolds of natural products. In particular, the synthesis of deoxygenated segments of polyketides poses a particular challenge to synthetic strategies. On this background, the mono&#8208;Zweifel Olefination of C2&#8208;symmetrical 1,3&#8208;bis(boronic esters) serves as the transformation in the desymmetrization step. This work shows the practicality of this concept on the synthesis of serricornin and (+)&#8208;invictolide. Giada Tedesco and Lucas Millbrodt are acknowledged for generating this artwork.

      <title>Flexible Metal Oxide Semiconductor Devices Made by Solution Methods</title>
      <dc:description>
Bend and flex: Solution&#8208;processed metal oxide semiconductors have shown great promise for next&#8208;generation flexible electronic devices. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art, flexible, solution&#8208;processed metal oxide thin&#8208;film transistor semiconductors are reviewed with respect to fabrication processes, structures, circuits, systems, and application in energy&#8208;harvesting devices.







Abstract
For the fabrication of next&#8208;generation flexible metal oxide devices, solution&#8208;based methods are considered as a promising approach because of their potential advantages, such as high&#8208;throughput, large&#8208;area scalability, low&#8208;cost processing, and easy control over the chemical composition. However, to obtain certain levels of electrical performance, a high process temperature is essential, which can significantly limit its application in flexible electronics. Therefore, this article discusses recent research conducted on developing low&#8208;temperature, solution&#8208;processed, flexible, metal oxide semiconductor devices, from a single thin&#8208;film transistor device to fully integrated circuits and systems. The main challenges of solution&#8208;processed metal oxide semiconductors are introduced. Recent advances in materials, processes, and semiconductor structures are then presented, followed by recent advances in electronic circuits and systems based on these semiconductors, including emerging flexible energy&#8208;harvesting devices for self&#8208;powered systems that integrate displays, sensors, data&#8208;storage units, and information processing functions.

      <title>Coexistence of Spin&#8211;Lattice Relaxation and Phonon&#8208;Bottleneck Processes in GdIII&#8211;Phthlocyaninato Triple&#8208;Decker Complexes under Highly Diluted Conditions</title>
      <dc:description>
Diluting effects: Phthalocyaninato&#8211;GdIII complexes with no distinct magnetic anisotropy undergo slow magnetic relaxation processes similar to single&#8208;molecule magnets. Magnetic dilution by doping the GdIII complexes into diamagnetic YIII complexes induced dual magnetic relaxation processes caused by spin&#8211;lattice relaxations and phonon&#8208;bottleneck effects (see figure).







Abstract
Gd3+ complexes have been shown to undergo unusual slow magnetic relaxation processes similar to those of single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs), even though Gd3+ does not exhibit strong magnetic anisotropy. To reveal the origin of the slow magnetic relaxation of Gd3+ complexes, we have investigated the magnetic properties and heat capacities of two Gd3+&#8208;phthalocyaninato triple&#8208;decker complexes, one of which has intramolecular Gd3+&#8211;Gd3+ interactions and the other does not. It was found that the Gd3+&#8211;Gd3+ interactions accelerate the magnetic relaxation processes. In addition, magnetically diluted samples, prepared by doping a small amount of the Gd3+ complexes into a large amount of diamagnetic Y3+ complexes, underwent dual magnetic relaxation processes. A detailed dynamic magnetic analysis revealed that the coexistence of spin&#8211;lattice relaxation and phonon&#8208;bottleneck processes is the origin of the dual magnetic relaxation processes.

&lt;p&gt;Gd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; complexes have been shown to undergo unusual slow magnetic relaxation processes similar to those of single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs), even though Gd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; does not exhibit strong magnetic anisotropy. To reveal the origin of the slow magnetic relaxation of Gd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; complexes, we have investigated the magnetic properties and heat capacities of two Gd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;phthalocyaninato triple&#8208;decker complexes, one of which has intramolecular Gd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;Gd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; interactions and the other does not. It was found that the Gd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;Gd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; interactions accelerate the magnetic relaxation processes. In addition, magnetically diluted samples, prepared by doping a small amount of the Gd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; complexes into a large amount of diamagnetic Y&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; complexes, underwent dual magnetic relaxation processes. A detailed dynamic magnetic analysis revealed that the coexistence of spin&#8211;lattice relaxation and phonon&#8208;bottleneck processes is the origin of the dual magnetic relaxation processes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Selective recovery of ammonia nitrogen from wastewaters with transition metal&#8208;loaded polymeric cation exchange adsorbents</title>
      <dc:description>Extracting valuable products from wastewaters with nitrogen&#8208;selective adsorbents can offset energy&#8208;intensive ammonia production, rebalance the nitrogen cycle, and incentivize environmental remediation. Separating nitrogen (N) as ammonium from other wastewater cations (e.g., K  +  , Ca  2+  ) presents a major challenge to N removal from wastewater and N recovery as high&#8208;purity products. We achieved high selectivity and capacity via ligand exchange of ammonia with ammine&#8208;complexing transition metals loaded onto polymeric cation exchange resins. Compared to commercial resins, metal&#8208;ligand exchange adsorbents exhibited higher ammonia removal capacity (8 meq/g) and selectivity (N/K  +  equilibrium selectivity of 10.1) in binary equimolar solutions. Considering optimal ammonia concentrations (200&#8208;300 meq/L) and pH (9&#8208;10) for metal&#8208;ligand exchange, we identified hydrolyzed urine as a promising candidate for selective TAN recovery. However, divalent cation exchange increased transition metal elution and reduced ammonia adsorption. Ultimately, metal&#8208;ligand exchange adsorbents can advance nitrogen&#8208;selective separations from wastewaters.</dc:description>

      <title>Nanoisozymes: The Origin behind Pristine CeO2 as Enzyme&#8208;mimetics</title>
      <dc:description>It is well&#8208;known that the interplay between molecules and active sites on the topmost surface of solid catalyst determines its activity in heterogeneous catalysis. The electron density of active site is believed to affect both adsorption and activation of reactant molecules at surface. Unfortunately, commercial X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) often adopted for such characterization is not sensitive enough to catalyst&#8217; topmost surface. In our opinion, most researchers fail to acknowledge this point during their catalytic correlation, leading to different interpretations found in literatures over the past decades. Recent studies on pristine Cu2O (Nat. Catal. 2019, 2, 889; Nat. Energy 2019, 4, 957) have clearly suggested that the electron density of surface Cu is facet dependent and plays a key role in CO2 reduction. Herein, we show that pristine CeO2 can reach 2506%/1133% increase in phosphatase&#8208;/peroxidase&#8208;like activity once the exposed surface is wisely selected. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) with surface probe, the electron density of surface Ce (i.e. the active site) is found facet&#8208;dependent and the key factor dictating their enzyme mimicking activities. Most importantly, the surface area of those CeO2 morphologies was demonstrated to become a factor only when their surface Ce can activate the adsorbed reactant molecules.</dc:description>

Most importantly, the surface area of those CeO2 morphologies was demonstrated to become a factor only when their surface Ce can activate the adsorbed reactant molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Mesoporous Carbon Materials Derived from Fullerene Microsheets for Energy Applications</title>
      <dc:description>Porous carbon materials with rich defects are promising candidates in energy storage and conversion applications. Herein, we report a facile template&#8208;free approach for the synthesis of a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) mesoporous carbon material derived from fullerene (C60) microsheets (FMSs) by simple heat&#8208;treatment. The sample obtained at 1000  o  C (FMS1000) shows a large surface area of 1507.6 m  2  g  &#8208;1  due to the presence of mesopores and rich defects which promote the electron and mass transfer in the electrocatalysis process of oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) showing excellent performances with an onset potential of 0.95 V, half&#8208;wave potential of 0.85 V and long&#8208;term durability of 2000 cycles which are comparable to that of commercial Pt/C. Moreover, FMS1000 displays a remarkable supercapacitive property with specific capacitance of 330.7 F g  &#8208;1  at 0.2 A g  &#8208;1  and long&#8208;term stability with capacitance retention of 97% over 50,000 cycles. Thus, a practical strategy for the production of mesoporous carbon materials with different morphological structures and porous defects as high&#8208;performance energy materials is advanced.</dc:description>

      <title>The Earlier the Better: Structural Analysis and Separation of Lanthanides with Pyrroloquinoline Quinone</title>
      <dc:description>Lanthanides (Ln) are critical raw materials, however, their mining and purification have a considerable negative environmental impact and sustainable recycling and separation strategies for these elements are needed. In this study, we present the precipitation and solubility behavior of Ln complexes with Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), the cofactor of recently discovered lanthanide (Ln) dependent methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) enzymes. In this context, we have been able to elucidate the molecular structure of a bio&#8208;relevant europium PQQ complex for the first time outside a protein environment. The complex crystallizes as an inversion symmetric dimer, Eu  2  PQQ  2  , with binding of Eu in the biologically relevant pocket of PQQ. LnPQQ and Ln1Ln2PQQ complexes are characterized using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP&#8208;MS), Infrared (IR) spectroscopy,  151  Eu&#8208;M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray total scattering, and Extended X&#8208;ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS). We show that a natural enzymatic cofactor is capable to achieve separation by precipitation of the notoriously similar, and thus difficult to separate, lanthanides to some extent.</dc:description>

      <title>Control over the Redox Cooperative Mechanism of Radical Carbene Transfer Reactions for the Efficient Active&#8208;Metal&#8208;Template Synthesis of [2]Rotaxanes</title>
      <dc:description>
Radical carbene transfer reactions promoted by macrocyclic CoII&#8211;porphyrinates bearing nitrogen&#8208;based axial ligands were used to assemble asymmetrical [2]rotaxanes through the active&#8208;metal&#8208;template technique. Careful control of the reaction conditions and proper choice of axial ligands enable formation of rotaxanes in up to 95% yield, while precluding formation of non&#8208;interlocked byproducts and total suppression of radical proton abstraction and carbene dimerization side reactions. The present study provides a detailed investigation on how to control the redox cooperative mechanism between the CoII ion in the porphyrin core and the radical carbene species to favor rotaxane formation.

      <title>Thermal adaptation of enzymes: impacts of conformational shifts on catalytic activation energy and optimum temperature</title>
      <dc:description>Thermal adaptation of enzymes is essential for both living organism development in extreme conditions and efficient biocatalytic applications. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to a shift in catalytic activity optimum temperatures remain unclear, and there is increasing experimental evidence that thermal adaptation involves complex changes in both structural and reactive properties. Here we apply a combination of enhanced protein conformational sampling with an explicit chemical reaction description to mesophilic and thermophilic homologs of the dihydrofolate reductase enzyme, and obtain a quantitative description of the stability and catalytic activity shifts between homologs.&#160;
In contrast with pictures focusing on protein flexibility and dynamics, we reveal the key role played by temperature&#8208;induced shifts in protein conformational distributions; we show that while the homologs' reaction free energies are similar, the striking discrepancy between their activation energies is caused by their different conformational changes with temperature. We propose an analytic model combining catalytic activity and structural stability which quantitatively predicts the shift in homologs' optimum temperatures, and we show that this general model provides a molecular explanation of changes in optimum temperatures for several other&#160;enzymes.</dc:description>

      <title>Desymmetrization of C2&#8208;Symmetric Bis(Boronic Esters) by Zweifel Olefinations</title>
      <dc:description>
It's a crab! By combining the Hoppe, Matteson, Aggarwal, and Zweifel chemistry, a bidirectional access to polyketides featuring the challenging 1,3&#8208;deoxypropionate motif is presented. The desymmetrization of various 1,3&#8208;bis(boronic esters) led to synthetically interesting building blocks. With this reliable method the pheromones invictolide and serricornin were synthesized.







Abstract
anti&#8208;Configured 1,3&#8208;dimethyl deoxypropionate motifs are important sub structures in natural products. Herein, we describe a bidirectional approach for the rapid construction of natural products featuring such motifs by using C2&#8208;symmetrical 1,3&#8208;bis(boronic esters). As for its application in convergent syntheses it was important to establish a selective mono&#8208;Zweifel olefination we describe the scope and limitations by using different 1,3&#8208;bis(boronic esters) and nucleophiles. This protocol takes advantage of the combination of the Hoppe&#8211;Matteson&#8211;Zweifel chemistry, which was elegantly put into practice by Aggarwal et&#8197;al. In order to show its applicability the total syntheses of two natural products, serricornin and (+)&#8208;invictolide, were performed.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It's a crab &lt;/b&gt;! By combining the Hoppe, Matteson, Aggarwal, and Zweifel chemistry, a bidirectional access to polyketides featuring the challenging 1,3&#8208;deoxypropionate motif is presented. The desymmetrization of various 1,3&#8208;bis(boronic esters) led to synthetically interesting building blocks. With this reliable method the pheromones invictolide and serricornin were synthesized.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;anti &lt;/i&gt;&#8208;Configured 1,3&#8208;dimethyl deoxypropionate motifs are important sub structures in natural products. Herein, we describe a bidirectional approach for the rapid construction of natural products featuring such motifs by using &lt;i&gt;C &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;symmetrical 1,3&#8208;bis(boronic esters). As for its application in convergent syntheses it was important to establish a selective mono&#8208;Zweifel olefination we describe the scope and limitations by using different 1,3&#8208;bis(boronic esters) and nucleophiles. This protocol takes advantage of the combination of the Hoppe&#8211;Matteson&#8211;Zweifel chemistry, which was elegantly put into practice by Aggarwal et&#8197;al. In order to show its applicability the total syntheses of two natural products, serricornin and (+)&#8208;invictolide, were performed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Boronate Ester&#8208;Capped Helicates</title>
      <dc:description>
Helicates with caps: Metal&#8208;templated multicomponent reactions of bispyridyloxime ligands with arylboronic acids give helicates with terminal arylboronate ester groups. The latter can be used to introduce functional groups such as pyridines, aldehydes, nitriles, and carboxylic acids in an apical position (see figure).







Abstract
Triple&#8208;stranded helicates were obtained by metal&#8208;templated multicomponent reactions of bispyridyloxime ligands with arylboronic acids. The helicates feature two hexa&#8208;coordinated MII ions (M=Fe, Zn, or Mn), which are embedded in a macrobicyclic ligand framework, and two arylboronate ester capping groups. The latter can be used to introduce functional groups such as pyridines, aldehydes, nitriles, and carboxylic acids in apical position. The functionalized helicates have the potential to be used as nanoscale building blocks for more complex assemblies, as evidenced by the synthesis of a 3&#8197;nm&#8208;sized trianglimine.

      <title>Control over the Redox Cooperative Mechanism of Radical Carbene Transfer Reactions for the Efficient Active&#8208;Metal&#8208;Template Synthesis of [2]Rotaxanes</title>
      <dc:description>
Controlling radical behavior: Manipulation of the redox cooperative properties of carbenoid species and CoII ions results in a powerful methodology for the synthesis of [2]rotaxanes through the active&#8208;metal&#8208;template technique.







Abstract
A 5,15&#8208;bis(1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl)porphyrin&#8208;based molecular clip covalently connected to a ditopic aliphatic ester loop moiety yields a semi&#8208;rigid macrocycle with a well&#8208;defined cavity. The resulting macrocycle fits the structural requirements for the preparation of porphyrinates capable of promoting formation of C&#8722;C bonds. To demonstrate the usefulness of porphyrin&#8208;based macrocycles, an active&#8208;metal&#8208;template synthesis of rotaxanes through a redox non&#8208;innocent carbene transfer reaction is described. Coordination of CoII ions into the porphyrin subunit followed by addition of appropriate monodentate nitrogen&#8208;based additives to function as axial ligands enables the radical carbene transfer reactions to styrene derivatives to occur exclusively through the cavity of the macrocycle to afford cyclopropane&#8208;linked rotaxanes in excellent 95&#8201;% yield. Investigation of the product distribution afforded from the rotaxane assembly reaction reveals how the redox cooperative action between the carbene species and the CoII ions can be manipulated to gain control over the radical&#8208;type mechanism to favor the productive rotaxane forming process.

      <dc:description>The synthesis of phosphine&#8208;based functional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has attracted great attention recently. Here, we present two examples of triphenylphosphine&#8208;based COFs (termed as P&#8208;COFs) with well&#8208;defined crystalline structures, high specific surface areas and good thermal&#160;stability. Furthermore, the rhodium catalysts using the obtained P&#8208;COFs as support materials show high turnover frequency (TOF) for the hydroformylation of olefins, as well as the excellent recycling performance. This work not only extended phosphine&#8208;based COFs family, but also demonstrated their application in immobilizing homogeneous metal&#8208;based (e.g., Rh&#8208;phosphine) catalysts for heterogeneous catalysis application.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a pathogenic bacterium and a causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), a disease that kills more than 1.5 million people worldwide annually. One of the main reasons for this high mortality rate is the evolution of new Mtb strains that are resistant to available antibiotics. Therefore, new therapeutics for TB are in constant demand. Here we report the development of such inhibitors that target two DNA replication enzymes of Mtb, namely DnaG primase and DNA gyrase, which share a conserved TOPRIM fold near the inhibitors&#8217; binding site. The molecules were developed on the basis of previously reported inhibitors for T7 DNA primase that bind near the TOPRIM fold. In order to improve the physicochemical properties of the molecules as well as their inhibitory effect on primase and gyrase, 49 novel compounds were synthesized as potential drug candidates in three stages of optimization. The last stage of chemical optimization yielded two novel inhibitors for the fast&#8208;growing nonpathogenic model Mycobacterium smegmatis (Msmg).</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Crystallization&#8208;induced emission enhancement (CIEE) was demonstrated for the first time for electrochemilunimescence (ECL) with two new benzosiloles. Compared with their solution, the films of the two benzosiloles gave CIEE of 24 times and 16 times. The mechanism of the CIEE&#8208;ECL was examined by spooling ECL spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis, photoluminescence, and DFT calculation. This CIEE&#8208;ECL system is a complement to the well&#8208;established aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE) systems. Unique intermolecular interactions are noted in the crystalline chromophore. The first heterogeneous ECL system is established for organic compounds with highly hydrophobic properties.</dc:description>

      <title>(Iso)Quinoline&#8208;Artemisinin Hybrids via Click Chemistry: Highly Potent Agents against Viruses</title>
      <dc:description>Viral infections cause life&#8208;threatening diseases in millions of people worldwide every year and there is urgent need for new effective antiviral drugs. Hybridization of two chemically diverse compounds into a new bioactive effector product is a successful concept to improve the hybrid drug&#8217;s properties compared to its parent compounds. In this study, (iso)quinoline&#8208;artemisinin hybrids, obtained via copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) or organocatalyzed click reactions (in organic solvents or in the presence of water), were analyzed in vitro for the first time for their inhibitory activity against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), as compared with their parent compounds and the reference drug ganciclovir. EC50 (HCMV) values were obtained in a range 0.22&#8208;1.20 &#181;M, indicating highly potent antiviral properties in the absence of cytotoxic effects on normal cells (CC50 &gt;100 &#181;M). The most active hybrid 1 (EC50 = 0.22 &#181;M) is 25 times more potent than its parent compound artesunic acid (EC50 = 5.41 &#181;M) and 12 times more efficient than the standard drug ganciclovir (EC50 = 2.6 &#181;M). Interestingly, hybrid 1 shows also inhibitory activity against hepatitis B virus in vitro (EC50 (HBeAg) = 2.57 &#181;M).</dc:description>

Halogenated, O &#8208;alky, O &#8208;allyl and O &#8208;propargyl examples were formed, as well as a 4'&#8208;azido analog. 4'&#8208; O &#8208;Propargyl and 4'&#8208;azido analogs reacted smoothly in Huisgen cycloaddition reactions, while p &#8208;Br and p &#8208;I compounds reacted in Pd&#8208;catalysed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. A series of examples of biotin&#8208;linked, dye&#8208;linked and dimeric cytochalasins was rapidly created. In vitro and in vivo bioassays of these compounds showed that 4'&#8208;halogenated and azido derivatives retained their cytotoxicity and antifungal activities; but a unique 4'&#8208;amino analogue was inactive. Attachment of larger substituents attenuated the bioactivities. In vivo actin&#8208;binding studies with adherent mammalian cells showed that actin remains the likely intracellular target.

      <title>Flexible RuII Schiff base complexes: G&#8208;quadruplex DNA binding and photo&#8208;induced cancer cell death</title>
      <dc:description>A series of new RuII Schiff base complexes built on the salphen moiety has been prepared. This includes four flexibile monometallic RuII compounds and six rigid bimetallic analogues that contain NiII, PdII or PtII cations into the salphen complexation site. Steady state luminescence titrations illustrated the capacity of the compounds to photoprobe G&#8208;quadruplex DNA. Moreover, the vast array of the Schiff base structural changes allowed to extensively assess the influence of the ligand surface, flexibility and charge on the interaction of the compounds with G&#8208;quadruplex DNA. This was achieved thanks to circular dichroism melting assays and bio&#8208;layer interferometry studies that pointed up high affinities along with good selectivities of RuII Schiff base complexes for G4 DNA. In cellulo studies were carried out with the most promising compounds. Cellular uptake with location of the compounds in the nucleus as well as in the nucleolus was observed. Cell viability experiments were performed with U2OS osteosarcoma cells in the dark and under light irradiation which allowed the measurements of IC50&#8217;s and photoindexes. They showed the substantial role played by light irradiation in the activity of the drugs in addition to the low cytotoxicity of the molecules in the dark. Altogether, the reported results emphasize the promising properties of RuII Schiff base complexes as a new class of candidates for developing potential G4 DNA targeting diagnostic or therapeutic compounds.</dc:description>

      <title>Oxygen Vacancy Abundant Ferrites on N&#8208;Doped Carbon Nanosheets as High Performance Li&#8208;Ion Battery Anode</title>
      <dc:description>The transition metal oxides as one of most promising anode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries often suffer from poor electronic conductivity and serious structural collapse. In this work, oxygen vacancy abundant CoFe  2  O  4  and NiFe  2  O  4  deposited on N&#8208;doped carbon nanosheets are designed and fabricated through a calcinations procedure and a solvothermal strategy using Zn&#8208;hexamine coordination frameworks as precursor. The as prepared NC@CoFe  2  O  4  and NC@NiFe  2  O  4  hybrids display improved cycle performances and rate capacities compared with CoFe  2  O  4  , NiFe  2  O  4  and Fe  2  O  3  . The enhanced lithium storage performances of NC@CoFe  2  O  4  and NC@NiFe  2  O  4  are attributed to the oxygen vacancies and conductive N&#8208;doped carbon nanosheets that increase the electronic conductivity and electrochemical reaction kinetics. This synthetic process in this work provides a new perspective in designing other transition metal oxides anodes with high&#8208;performance.</dc:description>

The enhanced lithium storage performances of NC@CoFe  2  O  4  and NC@NiFe  2  O  4  are attributed to the oxygen vacancies and conductive N&#8208;doped carbon nanosheets that increase the electronic conductivity and electrochemical reaction kinetics. This synthetic process in this work provides a new perspective in designing other transition metal oxides anodes with high&#8208;performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Hydrazone&#8208;Linked Heptazine Polymeric Carbon Nitrides for Synergistic Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
Synergistic effects: A novel and environmentally friendly method for preparing heptazine&#8208;based mesoporous polymeric carbon nitrides with hydrazone links formed through a simple Schiff base condensation and their photocatalytic activity in the visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol is presented.







Abstract
Heptazine&#8208;based conjugated polymeric carbon nitrides (PCNs) are promising metal&#8208;free photocatalysts, yet their synthesis is challenging due to the electron&#8208;deficiency and insolubility of heptazine units. Indeed, heptazine&#8208;containing polymers have only been prepared through nucleophilic substitution with amines by using toxic cyameluric chloride as the starting material. Herein, we report the novel and environmentally friendly method for preparing heptazine&#8208;based mesoporous PCNs with hydrazone links formed through a simple Schiff base condensation of melem&#8208;NH2 and aldehydes. Unlike cyameluric chloride, melem&#8208;NH2 is non&#8208;toxic, stable, and can be readily obtained from melem and hydrazine in solution. We demonstrate that the hydrazone linkages and the heptazine units synergistically enhance the photocatalytic activity of PCNs in visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. In particular, the polymer constructed from melem&#8208;NH2 and p&#8208;phthalaldehyde shows 17&#8197;times more activity than graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4).

      <title>Phosphate Ion&#8208;Functionalized CoS with Hexagonal Bipyramid Structures from Metal&#8208;Organic Framework: Bifunctionality towards Supercapacitors and Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>To solve energy&#8208;related environmental problems and energy crisis, efficient electrochemical materials have been developed as alternative energy storage and conversion systems. Abundant transition metals and their sulfides are attractive electrochemical materials. Herein, we reported an efficient phosphorization strategy, which improved the overall electrochemical performance of metal sulfides. In detail, CoS hexagonal bipyramids were synthesized through simple calcination combined with  in situ  sulfurization of a cobalt&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework template, and then phosphate ion&#8208;functionalized CoS (P&#8208;CoS) was prepared through a phosphorization reaction. P&#8208;CoS exhibited outstanding electrochemical activity as a bifunctional material,  i.e.  both supercapacitor electrode and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst. Supercapacitors based on CoS and P&#8208;CoS as the electrodes had high specific capacitances of 304 and 442 F g  &#8208;1  respectively, and remained stable after over 10000 cycles at 5 A g  &#8208;1  . For OER, P&#8208;CoS has a current density of 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  at overpotential of 340 mV, with a small Tafel slope. In conclusion, functionalizing CoS with phosphate ion is a promising method for enhancing chemical reactivity and accelerating ion and electron transfer.</dc:description>

      <title>Insights into the mechanism of gold(I) oxidation with aryldiazonium salts</title>
      <dc:description>In the last decade, aryldiazonium salts have attracted interest as coupling partners in cross&#8208;coupling reactions mediated by gold. Initially, the presence of a photocatalyst and a light source was needed to achieve gold oxidation with these electrophiles.

In this review, we summarized the transformations developed so far using aryldiazonium salts as electrophiles with special emphasis on mechanistic studies.

Positive&#8208;ion MALDI is introduced as a new sensitive method for analysis of CPP&#8835;fullerene complexes, enabling the detection of novel complexes [[12]CPP&#8835;C  60, 70 and 84  ]  +&#9679;  and [[10]CPP&#8835;C  84  ]  +&#9679;  . Selective binding can be observed when mixing one fullerene with two CPPs or vice versa, reflecting ideal size requirements for efficient complex formation. Geometries, binding and fragmentation energies of CPP&#8835;fullerene complexes from DFT calculations explain the observed fragmentation behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>The mechanism of the intramolecular hydrocarbyl metathesis within a planar triruthenium cluster &#8211; combining core flexibility with hydride mobility</title>
      <dc:description>The formation and cleavage of C&#8208;C bonds is of utmost importance in synthetic chemistry. While most of the existing homogeneous catalysts are mononuclear, knowledge of the behavior of polynuclear species is much more limited. By using computational methods, here we shed light into the mechanism of the thermally induced isomerization of Cp*3Ru3(&#956;&#8208;H)2(&#956;3&#8208;&#951;2&#8208;pentyne)(&#956;3&#8208;pentylidyne) (2) into Cp*3Ru3(&#956;&#8208;H)2(&#956;3&#8208;&#951;2&#8208;octyne)(&#956;3&#8208;ethylidyne) (3), a process that involves the migration of a C3  fragment between the hydrocarbyl ligands and across the plane formed by the three Ru centers. Our results show this to be a complex transformation that comprises of five individual rearrangements in an  A&#8208;B&#8208;A&#8208;B&#8208;A  order. Each rearrangement A  consists of the CH migration from the &#956;3&#8208;&#951;2&#8208;alkyne into the &#956;3&#8208;alkylidine ligand in the other side of the Ru3  plane. This process is facilitated by the cluster&#8217;s ability to adopt open&#8208;core structures in which one Ru&#8208;Ru bond is broken and a new C&#8208;C bond is formed. On the contrary, rearrangements B  do not involve the formation of C&#8208;C bonds nor do they require the opening of the cluster core. Instead, they consist of the isomerization of the &#956;3&#8208;&#951;2&#8208;alkyne and &#956;3&#8208;alkylidyne ligands on each side of the Ru&#8323; plane into &#956;3&#8208;alkylidyne and &#956;3&#8208;&#951;2&#8208;alkyne, respectively. This implies the migration of three H atoms within the hydrocarbyl ligands, and it is aided by the cluster&#8217;s ability to behave as a H reservoir. All in all, this study highlights the plasticity of these structures, whereby Ru&#8208;Ru, Ru&#8208;C, Ru&#8208;H, C&#8208;C, and C&#8208;H bonds are formed and broken with surprising ease.</dc:description>

      <title>Enhanced the electrochemical performance of high voltage LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4&#160;cathode in carbonate based electrolyte by a novel and low cost functional additive</title>
      <dc:description>Butyric anhydride (BA) is used as an effective functional additive to improve the electrochemical performance of high voltage LiNi  0.5  Mn  1.5  O  4  (LNMO) cathode. In presence of 0.5 wt.% BA, the capacity retention of LNMO/Li cell is significantly improved from 15.3 % to 88.4 % after 200 cycles at 1 C. Furthermore, the rate performance of LNMO/Li cell is also effectively enhanced and the capacity is up to 112 m Ah g  &#8208;1  even at 5 C, which is considerably higher than that LNMO/Li cell in electrolyte without BA additive (95.4 m Ah g  &#8208;1  at 5 C). Linear sweep voltammetry and cyclic voltammetry results reveal that the BA additive can be preferentially oxidized to construct a stable cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) film upon the LNMO cathode. Subsequently, the BA&#8208;derived CEI film can alleviate the decomposition of the electrolyte and the dissolution of Mn and Ni ions from LNMO cathode as well as maintain the structural stability of LNMO cathode during the cycling process, which leads to outstanding electrochemical performance. Therefore, this work provides an effective and low&#8208;cost functional electrolyte for high&#8208;voltage LNMO&#8208;based LIBs.</dc:description>

      <title>Electronic Finetuning of 8&#8208;Methoxy Psoralens by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling: Acidochromicity and Solvatochromicity</title>
      <dc:description>
A diverse and colorful library of novel psoralens can be obtained by cross&#8208;coupling reactions of 5&#8208;bromo&#8208;8&#8208;methoxypsoralen, which was prepared by a novel multistep synthesis. Photophysical properties, such as emission solvatochromicity and acidochromicity make this class of functional chromophores particularly attractive.







Abstract
Differently 5&#8208;substituted 8&#8208;methoxypsoralens can be synthesized by an efficient synthetic route with various cross&#8208;coupling methodologies, such as Suzuki, Sonogashira and Heck reaction. Compared to previously synthesized psoralens, thereby promising daylight absorbing compounds as potentially active agents against certain skin diseases can be readily accessed. Extensive investigations of all synthesized psoralen derivatives reveal fluorescence in the solid state as well as several distinctly emissive derivatives in solution. Donor&#8208;substituted psoralens exhibit remarkable photophysical properties, such as high fluorescence quantum yields and pronounced emission solvatochromicity and acidochromicity, which were scrutinized by Lippert&#8211;Mataga and Stern&#8211;Volmer plots. The results indicate that the compounds exceed the limit of visible light, a significant factor for potential applications as an active agent. In addition, (TD)DFT calculations were performed to elucidate the underlying electronic structure and to assign experimentally obtained data.

Donor&#8208;substituted psoralens exhibit remarkable photophysical properties, such as high fluorescence quantum yields and pronounced emission solvatochromicity and acidochromicity, which were scrutinized by Lippert&#8211;Mataga and Stern&#8211;Volmer plots. The results indicate that the compounds exceed the limit of visible light, a significant factor for potential applications as an active agent. In addition, (TD)DFT calculations were performed to elucidate the underlying electronic structure and to assign experimentally obtained data.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Phosphinine&#8208;Derived 1&#8208;Phospha&#8208;7&#8208;Bora&#8208;Norbornadiene: Frustrated Lewis Pair Type Activation of Triple Bonds</title>
      <dc:description>
Just like an FLP: A hetero&#8208;norbornadiene incorporating phosphorus and boron atoms is accessible by a facile salt metathesis procedure. Although this compound represents a classical Lewis acid&#8211;base adduct, its reactivity is reminiscent of frustrated Lewis pairs.

Abstract
Salt metathesis of 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triphenylphosphacyclohexadienyl lithium and chlorobis(pentafluorophenyl)borane affords a 1&#8208;phospha&#8208;7&#8208;bora&#8208;norbornadiene derivative 2. The C&#8801;N triple bonds of nitriles insert into the P&#8722;B bond of 2 with concomitant C&#8722;B bond cleavage, whereas the C&#8801;C bonds of phenylacetylenes react with 2 to form &#955;4&#8208;phosphabarrelenes. Even though 2 must formally be regarded as a classical Lewis adduct, the C&#8801;N and C&#8801;C activation processes observed (and the mild conditions under which they occur) are reminiscent of the reactivity of frustrated Lewis pairs. Indeed, NMR and computational studies give insight into the mechanism of the reactions and reveal the labile nature of the phosphorus&#8211;boron bond in 2, which is also suggested by detailed NMR spectroscopic studies on this compound. Nitrile insertion is thus preceded by ring opening of the bicycle of 2 through P&#8722;B bond splitting with a low energy barrier. By contrast, the reaction with alkynes involves formation of a reactive zwitterionic methylphosphininium borate intermediate, which readily undergoes alkyne 1,4&#8208;addition.

      <title>Unusual Structures of the Parent Molecules Diarsene, Distibene, and Dibismuthene. Toward Their Observation</title>
      <dc:description>There is considerable interest, from both experimental and theoretical perspectives, in molecules incorporating multiple bonds between main group elements. Herein, we not only consider the parent molecules HE=EH (E = As, Sb, Bi), but also a number of their isomers. For each E2 H2 molecule, a number of different structures were optimized with four different DFT methods. Final structures were determined with the coupled cluster method CCSD(T) using large basis sets, namely cc&#8208;pVQZ&#8208;PP, incorporating relativistic psuedopotentials. All feasible dissociation pathways are examined. For all three E2H2 molecules the trans isomer lies lowest in energy, with the cis isomer higher by 2.7 (As), 2.1 (Sb), and 1.8 (Bi) kcal/mol, respectively. However, both cis and trans structures should be observable, as large barriers (27.7, 20.5, and 17.7 kcal/mol) separate them. For both the cis and tran s structures, in the infrared the strong E&#8208;H stretching frequencies should also be observable. Only the cis structures have dipole moments (0.62, 0.01, and 0.83 debye, respectively), and their observation by microwave spectroscopy would be stunning. Also considered were the higher energy vinylidene&#8208;like, pyramidal, monobridged, and linear structures. We conclude that molecules such as HSb=SbH&#8208;Fe(CO)4, HBi=BiH&#8208;Fe(CO)4, and related systems, should be feasible synthetic targets.</dc:description>

      <title>Multipolar Porphyrin&#8208;Triazatruxene Arrays for Two&#8208;Photon Fluorescence Cell Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>Two&#8208;photon excited fluorescent (TPEF) materials are highly desirable for bioimaging applications owing to their unique characteristics of deep&#8208;tissue penetration and high spatiotemporal resolution. Herein, by connecting one, two, or three electron&#8208;deficient zinc porphyrin units to an electron&#8208;rich triazatruxene core via ethynyl &#960;&#8208;bridges, conjugated multipolar molecules  TAT&#8208;(ZnP)  n  (n = 1&#8208;3) were developed as TPEF materials for cell imaging. The three new dyes present high fluorescence quantum yields (0.40&#8208;0.47) and rationally improved two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) properties. In particular, the peak TPA cross section of  TAT&#8208;ZnP  (436 GM) is significantly larger than that of the  ZnP  reference (59 GM). The  &#948;  TPA  values of  TAT&#8208;(ZnP)  2  and  TAT&#8208;(ZnP)  3  further increase to 1031 and up to 1496 GM respectively, indicating the effect of incorporated ZnP units on the TPA properties. The substantial improvement of the TPEF properties is attributed to the formation of &#960;&#8208;conjugated quadrapole/octupole molecules and the extension of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;D systems, which has been rationalized by density function theory (DFT) calculations. Moreover, all of the three new dyes display good biocompatibility and preferential targeting ability toward cytomembrane, thus can be superior candidates for TPEF imaging of living cells.

      <title>Partially fluorinated copolymers as oxygen sensitive 19F MRI agents</title>
      <dc:description>19  F magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an promising emerging imaging modality. Specifically, the inherent sensitivity of the spin&#8208;lattice relaxation time (  T  1  ) of  19  F nuclei to oxygen partial pressure makes  19  F MRI an attractive non&#8208;invasive approach to quantify tissue oxygenation in a spatiotemporal manner. There remain, however, few materials with the adequate sensitivity to be used as oxygen&#8208;sensitive  19  F MRI agents. Herein, we report highly fluorinated monomers that provide a platform to realize water&#8208;soluble, partially fluorinated copolymers as  19  F MRI agents with the required sensitivity to quantify solution oxygenation at clinically relevant magnetic field strengths. The synthesis of a systematic library of partially fluorinated copolymers enabled a comprehensive evaluation of copolymer structure&#8211;property relationships relevant to  19  F MRI.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;19  F magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an promising emerging imaging modality. Specifically, the inherent sensitivity of the spin&#8208;lattice relaxation time (  T  1  ) of  19  F nuclei to oxygen partial pressure makes  19  F MRI an attractive non&#8208;invasive approach to quantify tissue oxygenation in a spatiotemporal manner. There remain, however, few materials with the adequate sensitivity to be used as oxygen&#8208;sensitive  19  F MRI agents. Herein, we report highly fluorinated monomers that provide a platform to realize water&#8208;soluble, partially fluorinated copolymers as  19  F MRI agents with the required sensitivity to quantify solution oxygenation at clinically relevant magnetic field strengths. The synthesis of a systematic library of partially fluorinated copolymers enabled a comprehensive evaluation of copolymer structure&#8211;property relationships relevant to  19  F MRI.

      <title>FeIII and FeII Phosphasalen Complexes: Synthesis, Characterization, and Catalytic Application for 2&#8208;Naphtol Oxidative Coupling</title>
      <dc:description>We report on the synthesis and characterization of three iron(III) phosphasalen complexes,  [Fe  III  (Psalen)(X)]  differing in the nature of the counter&#8208;anion/exogenous ligand (X  &#8208;  = Cl  &#8208;  , NO  3  &#8208;  , OTf  &#8208;  ), as well as the neutral iron(II) analogue,  [Fe  II  (Psalen)]  . Phosphasalen (Psalen) differs from salen by the presence of iminophosphorane (P=N) functions in place of the imines. All the complexes were characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, UV&#8208;vis, EPR, and cyclic voltammetry. The [Fe  II  (Psalen)] complex was shown to remain tetracoordinated even in coordinating solvent but exhibits surprisingly a magnetic moment in line with a Fe  II  high spin ground state. For the Fe  III  complexes, the higher lability of triflate anion compared to nitrate was demonstrated. As they exhibit lower reduction potentials compared to their salen analogues, these complexes were tested for the coupling of 2&#8208;naphtol using O  2  from air as oxidant. In order to shed light on this reaction, the interaction between 2&#8208;napthol and the Fe  III  (Psalen) complexes was studied by cyclic voltammetry as well as UV&#8208;vis spectrosocopy.</dc:description>

      <title>Selective Release of Doxorubicin from Cucurbit[8]uril Stabilized Gold Supra&#8208;pyramid&#160;Host at pH of Small Intestine</title>
      <dc:description>Gold supra&#8208;pyramid structures were obtained by the addition of acidic solution of cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) to an aqueous solution of citrate stabilized gold nanoparticles (AuNP). The reaction resulted in the precipitation of supra&#8208;pyramid from the solution just after 1 min of shaking. Microscopic images confirmed formation of supra&#8208;pyramid. The stepwise structural transformation towards supra&#8208;pyramid was examined with variable concentration of CB[8] to AuNP solution. Anionic counter parts of these acids (Br&#8211;, NO3&#8211;, SO42&#8211;&#160;and Cl&#8211;) controlled the size of the synthesized supra&#8208;pyramids. These supra&#8208;pyramid hosts showed uptake of three anticancer drugs: oral drugs etoposide, prednisolone and intravenous drug doxorubicin. Releases of drugs from these hosts were emulated at acidic stomach pH, basic small intestinal pH and in presence of human serum albumin (HSA). The specific release of doxorubicin was confirmed at small intestinal pH 7.4. Poor release of drugs in presence of CB[8] specific guest 1&#8208;adamantanamine confirmed the role of supra&#8208;pyramid as exclusive host. The release of doxorubicin from supra&#8208;pyramid at pH 7.4 was confirmed by fluorescence microscopic imaging with prostate cancer DU&#8208;145 cell line.</dc:description>
