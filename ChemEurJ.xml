         <title>Design and Evaluation of Azaspirocycles as RNA binders</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study presents efficient synthetic pathways for preparing novel azaspirocycles. These methodologies involve functionalizing key bicyclic hydrazines with a substituent on one of their bridgehead carbon atoms. The desired spirocyclic cores were successfully obtained through double reductive amination reactions, intramolecular cyclizations, and cleavages of the N&#8208;N bond. The isolated molecules possess unique three&#8208;dimensional structures, suggesting potential applications in medicinal chemistry and drug discovery. With the growing interest in targeting nucleic acids as a complementary approach to protein&#8208;targeting strategies for developing novel active compounds, we investigated the potential of the synthesized azaspirocycles as RNA binders. As a proof of concept, we highlight the promising activity of some compounds as strong binders of HIV&#8208;1 TAR RNA and inhibitors of Tat/TAR interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Luminescent Terpyridine&#8208;Based Metallo&#8208;Bowties with Alkyl Chain&#8208;Bridged Dimerized Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Numerous metallo&#8208;supramolecules with well&#8208;defined sizes and shapes have been successfully constructed via the strong coordination interaction between terpyridine (TPY) moieties and ruthenium cations. However, the pseudo&#8208;octahedral geometry of &lt;TPY&#8208;Ru&#8208;TPY&gt; unit hampers the luminescent properties of such metallo&#8208;architectures, thus limiting their applications as optical materials. To address this issue, we herein use a flexible alkyl chain to bridge TPY building blocks, replacing conventional &lt;TPY&#8208;Ru&#8208;TPY&gt; linkage. The introduction of alkyl chain guides the self&#8208;assembly into desired architecture while simultaneously eliminating the quenching effects typically associated with the &lt;TPY&#8208;Ru&#8208;TPY&gt; linkage. More importantly, this design strategy enables the precise construction of bowtie&#8208;shaped metallo&#8208;supramolecules with significantly enhanced emission. The incorporation of alkyl chain linkage not only maintains structural integrity but also enhances optical performance, making these metallo&#8208;supramolecular assemblies highly promising for applications in advanced photonic and luminescent materials. This study offers a versatile approach to construct complex metallo&#8208;supramolecular architectures with desired optical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Quenching Rate Constants of Lewis Base&#8208;Boryl Radical by Substrates: a Laser Flash Photolysis Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The advanced strategy using  Lewis base&#8208;boryl radicals (LBRs) has recently been proposed for the addition of alkyl substituents to the full&#8208;carbon quaternary center of an organic molecule. However, as the rate&#8208;determining step in the whole route, reaction rate constants of LBRs with substrates are extremely lacking. In this paper, 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP)&#8208;BH2&#8226; was selected as a representative of LBRs, and its reactions with six monochloro&#8208;substituted substrates, including three methyl chlorobenzoates and three chlorinated acetanilides were studied in experiments and theoretical calculations. The bimolecular reaction rate constants, kq, were determined using laser flash photolysis approach. By comparing activation energies along the two addition pathways, we have clarified the rate&#8208;determining step as the attacking to carbonyl oxygen instead of chlorine atom. Furthermore, noncovalent interaction (NCI) analyses on these substrates indicate that weak interactions, such as hydrogen&#8208;bonding and van der Waals interactions, have significant influence on the reactivity of these substrates. Our study provides concrete clues to extend this synthetic strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;step Macrocycle&#8208;to&#8208;Macrocycle Conversion Towards Two New Macrocyclic Arenes with Different Structures and Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two new macrocyclic arenes H1 and H2 were conveniently synthesized by the one&#8208;step reaction of carboxylic acid substituted octopus[3]arene. It was found that H1 was composed of three ethenoanthracene subunits with a rigid hexagonal structure and H2 contained two ethenoanthracene subunits and one anthracene subunit with a rigid house&#8208;shaped structure. Among them, H2 exhibited strong blue fluorescence due to the existence of an anthracene subunit. Moreover, both H1 and H2 showed large and electron&#8208;rich cavities, which enable them to effectively complex different nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocyclic salt guests in solution and the solid state. It was further found that H2 exhibited stronger complexation towards the tested guests than H1 probably due to the stronger charge&#8208;transfer interactions between H2 and the guests.</dc:description>

         <title>Isoreticular Contraction in Dicopper Paddle&#8208;Wheel&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks to Enhance C2H2/CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving a balance between high selectivity and uptake is a formidable challenge for the purification of acetylene from mixtures with carbon dioxide, particularly when seeking to maximize both C2H2 adsorption capacity and C2H2/CO2 separation selectivity in crystalline porous materials. In this study, leveraging the principles of reticular chemistry, we selected two tetracarboxylate&#8208;based linkers and combined them with Cu2+ ions to synthesize two isoreticular dicopper paddle&#8208;wheel&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs): Cu&#8208;TPTC (terphenyl&#8208;3,3&#8217;,5,5&#8217;&#8208;tetracarboxylic acid , H4TPTC) and Cu&#8208;ABTC (3,3,5,5&#8208;azobenzenetetracarboxylic acid, H4ABTC). The structural and sorption analyses revealed that Cu&#8208;ABTC, despite having slightly smaller pores due to the strategic replacement of a phenyl ring with an azo group between two tetratopic ligands, maintains high porosity compared to Cu&#8208;TPTC. Furthermore, Cu&#8208;ABTC outperforms Cu&#8208;TPTC in terms of C2H2 adsorption capacity (196 cm3 g&#8208;1 at 298 K and 1 bar) and C2H2/CO2 separation selectivity (16.5~5.6). These findings were corroborated by dynamic breakthrough experiments and computational modeling. This research highlights the potential of the isoreticular contraction strategy in enhancing MOFs for sophisticated gas adsorption and separation processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Basics and Advances of Manganese&#8208;Based Cathode Materials for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is greatly crucial to develop low&#8208;cost energy storage candidates with high safety and stability to replace alkali metal systems for a sustainable future. Recently, aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have received tremendous interest owing to their low cost, high safety, wide oxidation states, and sophisticated fabrication process. Nanostructured manganese (Mn)&#8208;based oxides in different polymorphs are the potential cathode materials for the widespread application of ZIBs. However, Mn&#8208;based oxide materials suffer from several drawbacks, such as low electronic/ionic conductivity and poor cycling performance. To overcome these issues, various structural modification strategies have been adopted to enhance their electrochemical activity, including phase/defect engineering, doping with foreign atoms (e.g., metal and/or nonmetal atoms), and coupling with carbon materials or conducting polymers. Herein, this review targets to summarize the advantages and disadvantages of the above&#8208;mentioned strategies to improve the electrochemical performance of the cathodic part of ZIBs. The challenges and suggestions for the development of manganese oxides for ZIBs are put forward.</dc:description>

         <title>Streamlining Thionyl Tetrafluoride (SOF4) and Pentafluoro&#8208;Oxosulfate [OSF5]&#8722; Anions Syntheses</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SuF&#8208;ficiently. The preparation of 100&#8197;mmol of thionyl tetrafluoride (SOF4) by the direct S&#8722;F bond formation from fluorine (F2) and thionyl fluoride (SOF2) was achieved in a quantitative and convenient manner. The solid&#8208;state structure was elucidated, and the reagent fully characterized. This efficient SuFEx reagent was transformed using a fluoride salt in pentafluorooxosulfate (OSF5) anion that can behave as an SOF4 storage reagent. Tuning the solvent system, the stable OSF5 anion appears as reactive as SOF4 for the formation of sulfurimidoyl fluorides.







Abstract
A one pot room temperature synthesis of thionyl tetrafluoride (SOF4) from elemental fluorine (F2) and thionyl fluoride (SOF2) is reported. The selective decagram scale process (100&#8197;mmol) allows a quantitative preparation of SOF4 with high purity. The solid&#8208;state structure has also been elucidated and compared with the reported gas phase one. The use of this reagent for the formation of the emerging pentafluorooxosulfate [cat][OSF5] anions led to the preparation of multiple ion&#8208;pairs (cat=Ag, NEt3Me, PPN, PPh4) in different organic solvents. The SuFEx reservoir ability of this anion was studied and by tuning the solvent system, the reactivity of pure thionyl tetrafluoride was observed using Ag[OSF5] in THF and acetone.

         <title>Size&#8208;Dependent Copper Nanoparticles Supported on Carbon Nanotubes with Balanced Cu+ and Cu0 Dual Sites for the Selective Hydrogenation of Ethylene Carbonate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu nanoparticles supported on surface modified carbon nanotubes with defects and oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups catalysts were prepared via a convenient impregnation method. The 40Cu/CNTs catalysts revealed remarkable methanol and ethylene glycol yields for the vapor&#8208;phase hydrogenation of ethylene carbonate. The synergistic effect of Cu0 and Cu+ dual sites contributed to the satisfactory catalytic performance of ethylene carbonate hydrogenation.







Abstract
Cyclic carbonate hydrogenation offers an alternative for the efficient indirect CO2 utilization. In this study, a series of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) supported xCu/CNTs catalysts with different Cu loadings were fabricated using a convenient impregnation method, and exhibited excellent catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of ethylene carbonate to methanol and ethylene glycol. The structural and physicochemical properties revealed that acid treatment of CNTs resulted in plentiful oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups, providing sufficient anchoring sites for copper species. The calcination process conducted under an inert atmosphere resulted in the formation of ternary CuO, Cu2O, and Cu composites, enhancing the metal&#8208;support interaction and facilitating the formation of balanced Cu0 and Cu+ dual sites as well as high active surface area after reduction. Contributed to the synergetic effect of balanced Cu+ and Cu0 species proved by density functional theory calculation and the electron&#8208;rich CNTs surface, the 40Cu/CNTs catalyst achieved strengthened catalytic performance with methanol yield of 83&#8201;%, ethylene glycol yield of 99&#8201;% at ethylene carbonate conversion of &gt;99&#8201;%, and 150&#8197;h of long&#8208;term running stability. Consequently, CNTs supported Cu serve as efficient non&#8208;silica based catalyst for ester hydrogenation.

The precise and accurate location of the hydrogen atoms in different B&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Li linkages in three lithium m&#8208;terphenylhydridoborates was determined by Hirshfeld atom refinement (HAR) of standard single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of the lithium m&#8208;terphenylhydridoborates [Li(2,6&#8208;Mes2C6H3)BH3]2 (1), Li(2,6&#8208;Mes2C6H3)2BH2 (2) and Li(OEt2)(2,6&#8208;Mes2C6H3)2BH2 (3) are reported. Hirshfeld Atom Refinement (HAR) of the experimentally obtained molecular structures by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography allowed the determination of the exact positions of the hydrogen atoms. The bond situations of the various B&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Li linkages were investigated by a complementary bonding analysis using various methods including atoms in molecules (AIM), electron localizability indicator (ELI&#8722;D), non&#8208;covalent interaction (NCI) index and the compliance matrix.

         <title>Secondary Sphere Lewis Acid Activated Heme Superoxo Adducts Mimic Crucial Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions in IDO/TDO Heme Dioxygenases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heme superoxide model compound with secondary coordination sphere Lewis acid activation has been utilized for the rational mimicking of reaction mechanism of the therapeutically relevant IDO/TDO dioxygenase enzymes. Therein, a distinct reaction precursor complex has been characterized, drawing potential parallels to the analogous ternary complex of IDO/TDO dioxygenases.







Abstract
Heme enzymes play a central role in a medley of reactivities within a wide variety of crucial biological systems. Their active sites are highly decorated with pivotal evolutionarily optimized non&#8208;covalent interactions that precisely choreograph their biological functionalities with specific regio&#8208;, stereo&#8208;, and chemo&#8208;selectivities. Gaining a clear comprehension of how such weak interactions within the active sites control reactivity offers powerful information to be implemented into the design of future therapeutic agents that target these heme enzymes. To shed light on such critical details pertaining to tryptophan dioxygenating heme enzymes, this study investigates the indole dioxygenation reactivities of Lewis acid&#8208;activated heme superoxo model systems, wherein an unprecedented kinetic behavior is revealed. In that, the activated heme superoxo adduct is observed to undergo indole dioxygenation with the intermediacy of a non&#8208;covalently organized precursor complex, which forms prior to the rate&#8208;limiting step of the overall reaction landscape. Spectroscopic and theoretical characterization of this precursor complex draws close parallels to the ternary complex of heme dioxygenases, which has been postulated to be of crucial importance for successful 2,3&#8208;dioxygenative cleavage of indole moieties.

         <title>Comparison of Different Organometallics Towards Electrophilic Aromatic 211At&#8208;Astatinations of Highly Reactive Tetrazines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrophilic 211At&#8208;labeling of trimethylsilanes, &#8208;germanes, or &#8211;stannanes was investigated on 5 different tetrazine structures. All 211At&#8208;labeled tetrazines could be labeled in radiochemical conversions of 60&#8211;90&#8201;%. Organotin proved to have the highest reactivity, however organogermanium and &#8208;silicon precursors were clearly advantaged as additional deprotection steps could avoided.







Abstract
Organometallics can be used as precursors for electrophilic 211At&#8208;statinations. In this report, we compared the potential of aryl trimethylsilanes, &#8208;germanes, or &#8211;stannanes to be used as precursors to 211At&#8208;label highly reactive tetrazines. Tetrazines can be used for pretargeted radioligand therapies or be applied as synthons to radiolabel rapidly and orthogonally a broad set of precursors such as peptides, mAbs or nanomedicines. All precursors could successfully be synthesized and radiolabeled. The reactivity of organogermanium reagents ranged between those of respective organotin and organosilicon precursors. Moreover, organogermanium reagents proved promising for accessing more complex and polar tetrazine scaffolds. In contrast to organotin derivatives, the use of protecting groups could be avoided for organogermanium and &#8208;silicon precursors. The developed 211At&#8208;labeled tetrazines could be labeled in radiochemical conversions of 60&#8211;90&#8201;%. Organogermanium and &#8208;silicon precursors were clearly advantaged as additional deprotection steps could avoided. Reported labeling procedures allow astatinations of highly reactive tetrazines to be used for pretargeted approaches or to applied as highly reactive synthons to label the next&#8208;generation of 211At&#8208;labeled radiopharmaceuticals.

         <title>Nitrate&#8208;Anion&#8208;Induced Formation of a 2D Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with an Unconventional Kagom&#233; Lattice Exhibiting Methanol&#8208;Mediated Ketone Catalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
This study presents a synthesis of a stable 2D MOF with an unconventional kagom&#233; lattice, namely, [Na0.33Co(L)(CH3OH)2](NO3)0.33 via nitrate anion recognition using a multifunctional phosphonato&#8208;amino&#8208;carboxylate ligand. This kagom&#233; lattice is efficient for the &#945;&#8208;methoxymethylation and aminomethylation of aromatic ketones, which can be in&#8208;situ exfoliated into one layer MOF nanosheets under catalytic reaction conditions.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with kagom&#233; lattice are attractive for their unique physical and chemical properties, but little attention has been paid to their catalytic properties. Herein, we report a 2D MOF based on a phosphonato&#8208;amino&#8208;carboxylate ligand (NaHL), i.&#8201;e., [Na0.33Co(L)(CH3OH)2](NO3)0.33 (2), which exhibits an unconventional kagom&#233; lattice. The formation of this kagom&#233; lattice is caused by the selective recognition of the NO3&#8722; anion by the phenolato group of L2&#8722; as evidenced by theoretical calculations. Compound 2 can be utilized for the &#945;&#8208;methoxymethylation and aminomethylation of aromatic ketones using methanol as a C1 source. Interestingly, compound 2 can be exfoliated in&#8208;situ into nanosheets with one&#8208;layer thickness under catalytic reaction conditions, which improves the catalytic efficiency. Based on the results of experiments and theoretical calculations, we proposed possible pathways for the catalytic reaction.

         <title>Unprecedented Cubic Mesomorphic Behaviour of Crown&#8208;Ether Functionalized Amphiphilic Cyclodextrins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crown&#8208;ether&#8208;functionalized amphiphilic &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrins have been shown for the first time to form thermotropic bicontinuous cubic mesophases without relying on other mesogenic groups, uncover a simple and practical strategy to alter the phase behavior of macrocyclic supramolecular liquid crystals via the tuning of the volume fractions of the hydrophilic domains of the mesogens. Solid&#8208;state NMR studies revealed such materials to conduct Li+ ion transport with a very low activation energy.







Abstract
Amphiphilic supramolecular materials based on biodegradable cyclodextrins (CDs) have been known to self&#8208;assemble into different types of thermotropic liquid crystals, including smectic and hexagonal columnar mesophases. Previous studies on amphiphilic CDs bearing 14 aliphatic chains at the secondary face and 7 oligoethylene glycol (OEG) chains at the primary face showed that the stability of the mesophase can be rationally tuned through implementation of terminal functional groups to the OEG chains. Here, we report the syntheses of first examples of crown ether&#8208;functionalized amphiphilic cyclodextrins that unexpectedly form thermotropic bicontinuous cubic phases. This constitutes the first reported examples of cyclodextrins forming such phases, which are potentially capable of 3D ion transport. Lithium composites were made to assess lithium conduction in the material. XRD revealed the added lithium salt destabilizes the cubic phase in favour of the smectic phase. Solid&#8208;state NMR studies showed that these materials conduct lithium ions with a very low activation energy.

         <title>Anisotropic Porosity and Interface Synergy Enhanced Gas Permselectivity in Heterolayer Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Membrane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anisotropic heterolayer metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) membrane, composed of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 and ZIF&#8208;8, is synthesized using a sequential growth strategy. The membrane's pore anisotropy (ranging from 3.4 to 6&#8197;&#197;) and a distinct MOF&#8208;MOF interface with chemically crosslinked pores demonstrate enhanced CO2/N2 permselectivity compared to the performance of individual MOF membranes.







Abstract
The pursuit of sustainable, carbon&#8208;free separation technology hinges on the efficient separation of gas mixtures with high separation factors and flow rates, i.&#8201;e. high permselectivity. However, achieving this objective is arduous due to the meticulous engineering at the angstrom scale and intricate chemical manipulation required to design the pores within membranes. To address this challenge, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for an anisotropic porous membrane has been devised. Employing a meticulous step&#8208;by&#8208;step methodology, two distinct porous metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are integrated to form a monolithic anisotropic membrane. By harnessing pore anisotropy (3.4 to 6&#8197;&#197;) aligned with the gas permeation direction and a unique interface characterized by cross&#8208;linked pores derived from the two distinct MOFs, this membrane transcends the performance limitations inherent in the individual MOF membranes (~45&#8201;% enhanced selectivity). This approach not only sheds light on the heterolayer membrane design strategy but also elucidates the intricate CO2/N2 permselectivity relationship inherent in the interface structure.

         <title>Physicochemical Analysis of Cu(II)&#8208;Driven Electrochemical CO2 Reduction and its Competition with Proton Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of Cu(II) complexes has been synthesized and employed for CO2 reduction. The favorable approach produces CO with higher selectivity when CO2 is inserted into an in&#8197;situ&#8208;generated hydride from the Cu&#8208;center through an EECC path. Herein, the proton reduction occurs to evolve H2 as a competitive reaction. A set of Cu(II) complexes has been synthesized and employed for CO2 reduction.

Abstract
The reduction of CO2 has become a key role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in efforts to search for long&#8208;term responses to climate change. We report a couple of CO2&#8208;reducing molecular catalysts based on earth&#8208;abundant copper complexes. These are [Cu(DPA)(PyNAP)] (1) and [Cu(DPA)(PyQl)] (2) (where, DPA=pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarboxylate, PyNAP=2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthyridine, and PyQl=2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)quinoline). The copper metal&#8208;catalysed 2&#8208;electron reduction of CO2 to CO in the presence of 2&#8208;protons is challenging. These catalysts exhibit the production of CO gas in DMF/water mixtures, achieving an impressive Faradaic efficiency of 84&#8201;% and 72&#8201;% for complex 1 and 2 at &#8722;1.7&#8197;V vs. SCE, respectively, for selective CO2 reduction. The production of H2 due to 2H++2e&#8722; was also observed as a byproduct through the competitive proton reduction reaction. This was cross&#8208;verified by online gas and mass analysis. A comprehensive series of electrochemical experiments have substantiated the homogeneous behaviour exhibited by these molecular electrocatalysts. Our investigations confirmed the stability of the electrocatalysts under the electrocatalytic conditions. The mechanistic pathways were proposed to work with the EECC and ECEC (E: electrochemical and C: chemical) mechanisms. A CO2 insertion into an in&#8208;situ generated hydride from the Cu&#8208;center generates CO through the favourable path. This critical path kinetically favors excess Faradaic efficiency in 1 than 2, which agrees with the computational investigation.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has become a key role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in efforts to search for long-term responses to climate change. We report a couple of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-reducing molecular catalysts based on earth-abundant copper complexes. These are [Cu(DPA)(PyNAP)] (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) and [Cu(DPA)(PyQl)] (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) (where, DPA=pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylate, PyNAP=2-(pyridin-2-yl)-1,8-naphthyridine, and PyQl=2-(pyridin-2-yl)quinoline). The copper metal-catalysed 2-electron reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CO in the presence of 2-protons is challenging. These catalysts exhibit the production of CO gas in DMF/water mixtures, achieving an impressive Faradaic efficiency of 84&#8201;% and 72&#8201;% for complex &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; at &#8722;1.7&#8197;V vs. SCE, respectively, for selective CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction.

         <title>C(sp2)&#8208;Arylsulfones Directly from Arylsulfonyl Chlorides with Boronic Acids by Photoactivation of Boosted EDA Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With a reinforced EDA complex platform, the visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated synthesis of C(sp2)&#8208;arylsulfones directly from commercially available arylsulfonyl chlorides and boronic acids at room temperature under photocatalyst&#8208;free conditions was demonstrated, featuring broad substrate scopes, simple operation, accessibility of raw materials and ease of scale&#8208;up.







Abstract
Directly with arylsulfonyl chlorides, a green and efficient deborylativesulfonylation of aryl(alkenyl)boronic acids has been developed to access both diarylsulfones and vinylarylsulfones in moderate to excellent yields at room temperature under visible&#8208;light irradiation. This protocol features broad C(sp2)&#8208;arylsulfone applicability, simple operation, accessibility of raw materials and ease of scale&#8208;up. The key to the success of this photoredox transformation is introducing catalytic amounts of additives, naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ols, thus boosting the formed electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes, which can dramatically improve not only the reaction efficiency but also the selectivity. This strategy was inspired and derived from specific substrates, representing a rare paradigm of how to exploit a more general reaction system. Moreover, extensive control experiments provide insights into the proposed mechanism.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Tosyl&#8208;Samroiyotmycin A and Its Biological Profiling</title>

3.4&#8201;times more active than the natural product: The tosyl group plays an important role in the synthesis of the enantiopure tosyl&#8208;samroiyotmycin A and its antimalarial activity. The synthetic strategy also gains access to a library of analogues. Antimalarial activity tests reveal promising results and provide insight into structure activity relationships.







Abstract
A total synthesis of the enantiopure syn,syn&#8208;tosyl&#8208;samroiyotmycin A, a C2&#8208;symmetric 20&#8208;membered antimalarial macrodiolide with syn,syn&#8208;configuration of the 8,24&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;9,25&#8208;dimethyl units and it's enantiopure anti,anti&#8208;derivative is described. The synthesis was accomplished utilizing a linear approach in 7 steps and 3&#8201;% overall yield via a sequence of diastereoselective methylation of SuperQuat oxazolidinone auxiliary, cross metathesis and Yamaguchi macrolactonization of fully functionalized seco&#8208;acids. By a similar approach we gained access to several samroiyotmycin analogues and precursors. Antimalarial activity was tested on multi&#8208;resistant (K1) and sensitive (Nf54) P.&#8197;falciparum strains providing insight into structure activity relationships. Both tosyl&#8208;oxazol unit as well as the syn&#8208;configuration of the two contiguous stereogenic centers turned out to be beneficial for antiplasmodial activity. For instance, syn,syn&#8208;tosyl&#8208;samroiyotmycin A showed 3.4 times higher activities than the &#8220;tosyl&#8208;free&#8221; natural product.

         <title>Enhancing the Chemical Stability of P12L24 Cage: Transformation of the Chemically Labile Imine Cage into a Robust Carbamate Cage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report enhancement in chemical stability of the imine&#8208;based porphyrinic cage P12L24 by converting it into a robust carbamate porphyrinic cage, c&#8208;P12L24, through a two&#8208;step post&#8208;synthetic modification process. First, the imine bonds in P12L24 were reduced to form an amine&#8208;based cage, r&#8208;P12L24, followed by carbamation using N,N&#8242;&#8208;carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) to yield c&#8208;P12L24. The resulting carbamate cage exhibits high stability under acidic and basic conditions (pH 1&#8211;13) and in the presence of moisture. 1H NMR, DOSY NMR, and DFT calculations revealed that reducing the imine bonds to amine increases the framework&#8217;s flexibility, causing partial structural collapse, whereas the carbamate formation restores structural rigidity. The insertion of a 4.0 nm molecular ruler into the cavity of zinc&#8208;metallated c&#8208;P12L24 via metal&#8208;ligand coordination further confirmed restoration of the cavity size and geometry of the original cage. This enhancement of chemical stability through carbamate formation can pave the way to a wide range of potential applications for the gigantic porphyrinic cage.</dc:description>

         <title>Flipping&#160;the Metalation of 4&#8208;Dimethylaminopyridine: Steric Repulsion versus&#160;London Dispersion Attraction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;covalent interactions, including the coordination of an organolithium reagent by a directing group and the steric hindrance from substituents, play a crucial role in determining the selectivity of metalation reactions. Here, we demonstrate the effective utilization of steric interactions for &#8220;flipping&#8221; the lithiation of 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). Introduction of a Me3Si substituent to the position 1 of DMAP or simple complexation with t&#8208;BuLi allows selective C3&#8208;lithiation, due to the steric hindrance of a C2&#8208;H bond by the bulky moiety at the pyridine nitrogen. This simple approach creates a convenient way to achieve the selective C3&#8208;functionalization of DMAP. In contrast, the utilization of an even bulkier i&#8208;Pr3Si substituent leads to exclusive C2&#8208;functionalization due to the dispersion interactions with organometallic bases. For the first time, it is demonstrated that the i&#8208;Pr3Si moiety can serve as a directing group, providing a new type of direct ortho&#8208;metalation effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Proximity Effects and Aggregation of Hamilton&#8208;Receptor Barbiturate Host&#8208;Guest Complexes Probed by Cross&#8208;Metathesis and ESI MS Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The molecular environment around supramolecular bonding systems significantly affects their stability and the assembly of host&#8208;guest complexes, most prominent for hydrogen bonds (H&#8208;bonds). Hamilton receptor&#8208;barbiturate host&#8208;guest complexes are well&#8208;known in solution, typically forming a 1:1 molar ratio complex. However, within a polymer matrix, these complexes can form higher&#8208;order assemblies, deviating from the standard 1:1 complex, which are challenging to characterize and often require lab&#8208;intensive methods. In this study, a novel Hamilton receptor (H) was equipped with cyclopentene moieties and used as a host to form host&#8208;guest complexes (H&#8208;B) with allobarbital (B), followed by covalent crosslinking. UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy titration experiments in different solvents and at various temperatures revealed that polar solvents containing additional H&#8208;bonding sites significantly reduce the formation of the 1:1 H&#8208;B complex, as indicated by a reduced association constant. Higher&#8208;order aggregates (HH&#8208;dimer, HHH&#8208;trimer) were subsequently detected via an alkene cross&#8208;metathesis (CM) reaction to fix the assemblies covalently, followed by analysis via electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI MS). This two&#8208;step method, firstly via CM fixation followed by ESI MS, was extended to study the H&#8208;B model complex within a polyisobutylene (PIB) matrix, presenting a direct method to analyze the complex host&#8208;guest assembly in solvent&#8208;free (polymer) environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Defining the Synthetic Scope of ortho&#8208;Quinone Methides by Quantifying Their Electrophilicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of aryl&#8208;substituted ortho&#8208;quinone methides (oQMs) was synthesised and structurally characterised. Kinetic studies of the nucleophilic additions of carbanions (reference nucleophiles) to oQMs were used to determine second&#8208;order rate constants k2 for the carbon&#8208;carbon bond forming reactions (20&#160;&#176;C, DMSO) at the oQMs&#8217; exocyclic &#960;&#8208;bond. Analysing the kinetic data by the linear free energy relationship lg k2 = sN(N+E) revealed the Mayr electrophilicities E of the oQMs. The electrophilicities E of oQMs correlate linearly with Hammett substituent constants and experimentally determined reduction potentials Epred as well as with quantum&#8208;chemically calculated methyl anion affinities (MAAs), which provides valuable tools for prediciting the reactivity of further types of oQMs. Embedding the oQMs in Mayr&#8217;s reactivity scales enables to predict novel nucleophilic reaction partners for oQMs and can productively be used to prepare simple Michael adducts as well as 4+2 or 4+1 cyclisation products as demonstrated in this work by several novel reactions with neutral or negatively charged C&#8208;, N&#8208;, and S&#8208;nucleophiles.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorine&#8208;18 is the predominant radionuclide used to label Positron Emission Tomography (PET) tracers. One outstanding challenge in nucleophilic aromatic radiofluorination reactions is the sensitivity of precursors and catalysts for basic reaction conditions, which are necessary for the work&#8208;up of [18F]fluoride, resulting in limited reproducibility. Triflyl [18F]fluoride is a new [18F]fluoride source that allows freedom in choice of type and amounts of base and cryptand. The aim of the current work is to explore the scope and limitations of triflyl [18F]fluoride in the late&#8208;stage nucleophilic aromatic 18F&#8208;fluorination of various functionalized precursors, exploring reduced amounts of base and cryptand. The assessment allowed for the application of this new nucleophilic [18F]fluoride reagent to the successful radiosynthesis of boron, stannane, hypervalent iodonium ylide and phenol substrates bearing electron&#8208;deficient, &#8208;neutral and &#8208;rich functional groups as well as the clinically relevant PET tracers [18F]FPEB, [18F]mFBG and [18F]SynVesT&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking the Potential of Push&#8208;Pull Pyridinic Photobases: Aggregation&#8208;Induced Excited&#8208;State Proton Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pH effect on the photophysics of three push&#8208;pull compounds bearing dimethoxytriphenylamine (TPA&#8208;OMe) as electron donor and pyridine as electron acceptor, with different ortho&#8208;functionalization (&#8211;H, &#8211;Br, &#8211;TPA&#8208;OMe), is assessed through steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic techniques in DMSO/water mixed solutions and in water dispersions over a wide pH range. The enhanced intramolecular charge transfer upon protonation of the pyridine&#160;leads to the acidochromic (from colorless to yellow) and acido(fluoro)chromic (from cyan to pink) behaviours of the investigated compounds. In dilute DMSO/buffer mixtures these molecules exhibited low pKa values (&#8804; 3.5) and short singlet lifetimes. Nevertheless, it is by exploiting the aggregation phenomenon in aqueous environment that the practical use of these compounds largely expands: i) the basicity increases (pKa &#8776; 4.5) approaching the optimum values for pH&#8208;sensing in cancer cell recognition; ii) the fluorescence efficiencies are boosted due to Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE), making these compounds appealing as fluorescent probes; iii) longer singlet lifetimes enable Excited&#8208;State Proton Transfer, paving the way for the application of these molecules as photobases (pKa* = 9.1). The synergy of charge and proton transfers combined to the AIE behaviour in these pyridines allows tunable multi&#8208;responsive optical properties providing valuable information for the design of new light&#8208;emitting photobases.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;component cyclization reaction of O&#8208;acyl oximes, silyl enol ethers and elemental sulfur has been developed, in which silyl enol ether acts as a C1 synthon to participate in cyclization reaction and build serious 2&#8208;aroylnaphthothiazoles and 2&#8208;aroylbenzothienothiazoles. Moreover, the products obtained exhibit favorable fluorescence properties, which indicates their potential application as functional materials.







Abstract
A three&#8208;component cyclization reaction of O&#8208;acyl oximes, silyl enol ethers and elemental sulfur has been developed, in which silyl enol ether acts as a C1 synthon to participate in cyclization reaction and build a series of 2&#8208;aroylnaphthothiazoles and 2&#8208;aroylbenzothienothiazoles. The preliminary exploration of the reaction mechanism indicated that this transformation probably proceeded through a radical process, involving S3&#8901;&#8722; as a key intermediate, enabling subsequent nucleophilic substitution with O&#8208;acyl oximes to afford iminosulfur radical, which undergoes 1,3&#8208;H shift to yield sulfur&#8208;centered radical intermediate. And then this intermediate undergoes radical addition with silyl enol ether, leading to the formation of the titled products through intramolecular cyclization and oxidation. Moreover, the products obtained exhibit favorable fluorescence properties, which indicates their potential application as functional materials.

         <title>Oxidative Cleavage of Aromatic C&#8722;O Linkages by Oxoammonium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidative cleavage of aromatic C(sp2)&#8722;O bond is implemented using water as oxygen source and oxoammonium salt as oxidant, which is efficiently applied into cleavage of lignin model compounds and depolymerization of PPO. The oxoammonium cation activates water to form hydroxy&#8208;oxoammonium adduct, which plays the key role in the oxidative cleavage. The recycling of oxoammonium cation is confirmed via electrolysis.







Abstract
Oxidative cleavage of aromatic C(sp2)&#8722;O bond is important to the conversion of biomass and plastic wastes into value&#8208;added chemicals. Here we put forward the oxidative cleavage of para&#8208;C&#8722;O bonds in phenolic compounds in use of oxoammonium salts as oxidant and water as the oxygen source. The mechanism is that oxoammonium cation activates water to form hydroxy&#8208;oxoammonium adduct and thus realizes the ipso&#8208;substitution of 4&#8208;alkoxyphenol, which is proved by substituent effect, isotope labelling experiments, and kinetic analysis. Furthermore, this protocol is successfully applied into the depolymerization of both lignin model compounds with &#945;&#8208;O&#8208;5 and 4&#8208;O&#8208;5 linkages and polyphenylene oxide (PPO).

We first developed the enantioselective Knoevenagel/Michael/cyclization cascade of isatins, cyanoacetates, and 3&#8208;aminomaleimides by employing quinidine&#8208;derived square amides. Under optimized conditions, derivatives of spiro[indoline&#8208;3,4&#8208;pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;b]pyridines] were obtained in good yields (78&#8201;%&#8211;91&#8201;%) with 53&#8201;%&#8211;99&#8201;% enantiomeric excess (ee).







Abstract
Asymmetric synthesis of derivatives of spiro[indoline&#8208;3,4&#8208;pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;b]pyridines] were first developed through the organocatalytic cascade of Knoevenagel/Michael/cyclization reactions using a quinidine&#8208;derived squaramide. Under the optimized conditions, the three&#8208;component reactions of isatins, cyanoacetates, and 3&#8208;aminomaleimides yield the desired heterocycle&#8208;fused spirooxindoles in good yields (78&#8211;91&#8201;%) with 53&#8201;%&#8211;99&#8201;% enantiomeric excess (ee). Notably, this reaction enables a broad substrate scope under mild conditions and provides a convenient method for the enantioselective construction of diverse spirooxindoles combined with dihydropyridine and maleimide skeletons, which has great potential for the construction of new bioactive chemical entities.

Two new non&#8208;centrosymmetric chalcogenides, ACuGa6S10 (A = Rb, Cs) have been successfully synthesized by an &#8220;iterative substitution&#8221; strategy based on chalcopyrite CuFeS2 structural template. ACuGa6S10 (A = Rb, Cs) exhibit wide suitable band gap of 2.48 and 2.40&#8197;eV, respectively, and a large second harmonic generation response (1.5 and 1.8&#215;AgGaS2).







Abstract
Two new non&#8208;centrosymmetric chalcogenides, ACuGa6S10 (A=Rb, Cs) have been successfully synthesized by an &#8220;iterative substitution&#8221; strategy based on chalcopyrite CuFeS2 structural template. Benefiting from the substitution of Fe3+ cations by Ga3+ cations, ACuGa6S10 (A = Rb, Cs) exhibit wide suitable band gap of 2.48 and 2.40&#8197;eV, respectively, which is about five times higher than their structure template CuFeS2, and a large second harmonic generation response (1.5 and 1.8&#215;AgGaS2). Combining theoretical calculation and structural analysis confirms that the [GaS4] tetrahedra make the main contribution on their good liner and nonlinear optical (NLO) performances. The &#8220;iterative substitution&#8221; strategy expands the design idea of materials and can lead to the discovery of a large number of IR NLO compounds.

         <title>Electrochemical Enantioselective Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling of Aldehydes with Aryl Iodides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni&#8208;electrocatalytic cross&#8208;coupling procedure between aldehydes and aryl halides is described leading to enantioenriched diarylmethanol derivatives in the presence of a chiral cyano&#8208;bis(oxazoline) ligand. An electroanalytical study was carried out to gain a better understanding of the mechanism, identifying a proposed ECE&#8208;type mechanism with a formal Ni(I) intermediate and highlighting the key role of the iron salts released by the soluble anode.







Abstract
The preparation of enantioenriched diarylmethanol derivatives is described using nickel&#8208;catalyzed electrochemical cross&#8208;couplings between various alkyl/aryl aldehydes and aryl iodides. Performed in an electrochemical cell equipped with an iron anode and a nickel cathode, this electrocatalytic variant led to the scalemic targeted products in the presence of 2,2&#8208;bis((4&#8197;R,5S)&#8208;4,5&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;dihydrooxazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)acetonitrile (L2), as enantiopure cyano&#8208;bis(oxazoline) ligand. X&#8208;ray structure analysis of a pre&#8208;catalyst, for instance the [Ni(II)(L2)2] complex, with L2 as an anionic bisoxazolinate ligand, confirms the chemical formulation of one nickel surrounded by two ligands. The redox behavior of the new Ni complexes generated in&#8197;situ was first assessed by cyclic voltammetry showing a redox wave at ca. &#8722;1.5&#8197;V that can be assigned to the two&#8208;electron reduction of the Ni(II) center to the Ni(0) state. Oxidative addition between the electrogenerated Ni(0) complex and aryl iodide was evidenced. An intense current was observed in presence of a mixture of the two substrates pertaining an electrocatalytic process. Interestingly, we found that the sacrificial iron anode plays a crucial role in the catalytic mechanism.

         <title>NMR Screen Reveals the Diverse Structural Landscape of a G&#8208;Quadruplex Library</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
G&#8208;quadruplexes are noncanonical nucleic acid structures with a range of biochemical functions. Here we used NMR to obtain a broad overview of the structural features of a 496&#8208;member G&#8208;quadruplex library. Our work highlights the surprising diversity of this library, and shows how NMR can be used to identify classes of sequences with distinct mutational signatures and functions.







Abstract
G&#8208;quadruplexes are noncanonical nucleic acid structures formed by stacked guanosine tetrads. Despite their functional and structural diversity, a single consensus model is typically used to describe sequences with the potential to form G&#8208;quadruplex structures. We are interested in developing more specific sequence models for G&#8208;quadruplexes. In previous work, we functionally characterized each sequence in a 496&#8208;member library of variants of a monomeric reference G&#8208;quadruplex for the ability to bind GTP, promote a model peroxidase reaction, generate intrinsic fluorescence, and to form multimers. Here we used NMR to obtain a broad overview of the structural features of this library. After determining the 1H NMR spectrum of each of these 496 sequences, spectra were sorted into multiple classes, most of which could be rationalized based on mutational patterns in the primary sequence. A more detailed screen using representative sequences provided additional information about spectral classes, and confirmed that the classes determined based on analysis of 1H NMR spectra are correlated with functional categories identified in previous studies. These results provide new insights into the surprising structural diversity of this library. They also show how NMR can be used to identify classes of sequences with distinct mutational signatures and functions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;G-quadruplexes are noncanonical nucleic acid structures formed by stacked guanosine tetrads. Despite their functional and structural diversity, a single consensus model is typically used to describe sequences with the potential to form G-quadruplex structures. We are interested in developing more specific sequence models for G-quadruplexes. In previous work, we functionally characterized each sequence in a 496-member library of variants of a monomeric reference G-quadruplex for the ability to bind GTP, promote a model peroxidase reaction, generate intrinsic fluorescence, and to form multimers. Here we used NMR to obtain a broad overview of the structural features of this library. After determining the &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR spectrum of each of these 496 sequences, spectra were sorted into multiple classes, most of which could be rationalized based on mutational patterns in the primary sequence. A more detailed screen using representative sequences provided additional information about spectral classes, and confirmed that the classes determined based on analysis of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR spectra are correlated with functional categories identified in previous studies. These results provide new insights into the surprising structural diversity of this library. They also show how NMR can be used to identify classes of sequences with distinct mutational signatures and functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exploring the Role of Titanate Perovskites in the Oxidation of Amines via Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Titanate perovskites, SrTiO3 and CaTiO3, were synthesised via hydrothermal approaches, with temperature and pressure parameters adjusted to optimise material purity. The selective ability of these materials for the photocatalytic oxidative self&#8208;coupling of benzylamine to produce N&#8208;benzylidenebenzylamine was evaluated under mild conditions, with CTO emerging as the most efficient catalyst for this reaction.







Abstract
Considering that structural differences could affect the photocatalytic efficiency of titanate perovskites, cubic SrTiO3 (STO) and tetragonal CaTiO3 (CTO) were synthesised as models to elucidate the structure&#8208;activity relationship. STO and CTO materials were produced through hydrothermal approaches, adjusting parameters such as temperature and pressure to optimise material purity. Among the perovskite photocatalysts, two stand out for their exceptional photocatalytic capacity and crystalline purity: CaTiO3, prepared at 180&#8201;&#176;C for 36&#8197;h, and SrTiO3, synthesised at 200&#8201;&#176;C for 24&#8197;h. Notably, we explore the selective ability of these materials for the photocatalytic oxidative self&#8208;coupling of benzylamine (BZA) to produce N&#8208;benzylidenebenzylamine (BZI), with CaTiO3 emerging as the most efficient catalyst for this reaction. The CTO material prepared at 180&#8201;&#176;C for 36&#8197;h (CTO180T&#8208;36) achieved a peak BZI production of 0.5&#8197;mM, with a total conversion of BZA after 7&#8197;h of irradiation. This study also emphasises the crucial role of reaction conditions and perovskite morphologies in fine&#8208;tuning photocatalytic performance. These findings highlight opportunities for developing efficient and selective photocatalytic processes, holding the compromise for applications in organic synthesis and sustainable green chemistry.

A convenient synthesis of planar chiral [2.2]paracyclophane imidazoline N,O&#8208;ligands has been developed. The application of these classes of ligands showed excellent performance in organozinc additions to aldehydes. An improved seven&#8208;step synthesis of [2.2]paracyclophane&#8208;imidazoline N,O&#8208;ligands (UCD&#8208;Imphanols) possessing both central and planar chirality is presented. These ligands are applied in organozinc additions to aldehydes, achieving enantioselectivities of up to 97&#8201;% ee in ethylation and 95&#8201;% ee (R) and 82&#8201;% ee (S) in arylation using (S,S,SP)&#8208; and (S,S,RP)&#8208;UCD&#8208;Imphanols, respectively.







Abstract
We present an improved and convenient synthesis of [2.2]paracyclophane&#8208;imidazoline N,O&#8208;ligands with central and planar chirality in seven steps starting from [2.2]paracyclophane. The utility of these ligands in organozinc additions to aldehydes is described. The asymmetric ethylation of aldehydes proceeded with enantioselectivities of up to 97&#8201;% ee, while the asymmetric arylation of aldehydes gave up to 95&#8201;% ee (R) and 82&#8201;% ee (S) using (S,S,SP)&#8208;UCD&#8208;Imphanol and (S,S,RP)&#8208;UCD&#8208;Imphanol, respectively.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Dependent Supramolecular Isomeric Co&#8208;CPs for Luminescence Recognition and Catalytic Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two supramolecular isomers displayed distinct luminescence of recognition biomarker 2,6&#8208;pyridinedicarboxylic acid (DPA) and homovanillic acid (HVA) and catalysis oxidation sulfides to sulfoxides.







Abstract
Two Co&#8208;based supramolecular isomers were synthesized from a fluorinated carboxylic acid ligand under hydrothermal conditions at varying temperatures. Both exhibited similar one&#8208;dimensional chain structures while different bending connections of the aromatic rings led to different supramolecular structures, namely CoCP&#8208;1 and CoCP&#8208;2, respectively. The structural differences of two isomers resulted in discrepant performance with regards to luminescence sensing and catalysis. CoCP&#8208;1 demonstrated more significant luminescence quenching activity toward biomarkers 2,6&#8208;pyridinedicarboxylic acid (DPA) and homovanillic acid (HVA), which could be distinguished in the presence of Eu3+. The limit of detection (LOD) was found to be as low as 3.4 and 1.3&#8197;&#956;M, respectively. The recovery rate of for HVA and DPA was within the range of 98.5&#8211;110.3&#8201;% and 84.6&#8211;99.3&#8201;% in simulated urine and serum, respectively, indicating potential reliability in monitoring these two analytes in real samples. Notably, CoCP&#8208;2 exhibited catalytic activity for the oxidation of thioethers to sulfoxides. Our finding here suggests that the coordination conformation of the ligands within supramolecular isomers plays a pivotal role in determining the structure and luminescence sensing/catalysis performance.

         <title>Endogenous Cu(II) Labeling for Distance Measurements on Proteins by EPR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quick and easy endogenous spin labeling: This work shows that hypotonic swelling is a reproducible and facile method to endogenously label proteins with Cu(II) protein spin label in E.&#8197;coli cells. The method enables the facile measurement of structural constraints in&#8208;cells. The figure was made using BioRender.com.







Abstract
In&#8208;cell measurements of the relationship between structure and dynamics to protein function is at the forefront of biophysics. Recently, developments in EPR methodology have demonstrated the sensitivity and power of this method to measure structural constraints in&#8208;cell. However, the need to spin label proteins ex&#8208;situ or use noncanonical amino acids to achieve endogenous labeling remains a bottleneck. In this work we expand the methodology to endogenously spin label proteins with Cu(II) spin labels and describe how to assess in&#8208;cell spin labeling. We quantify the amount of Cu(II)&#8208;NTA in cells, assess spin labeling, and account for orientational effects during distance measurements. We compare the efficacy of using heat&#8208;shock and hypotonic swelling to deliver spin label, showing that hypotonic swelling is a facile and reproducible method to efficiently deliver Cu(II)&#8208;NTA into E.&#8197;coli. Notably, over six repeats we accomplish a bulk average of 57&#8197;&#956;M spin labeled sites, surpassing existing endogenous labeling methods. The results of this work open the door for endogenous spin labeling that is easily accessible to the broader biophysical community.

         <title>Networked Multicomponent Ensemble as AND Gate with FRET Output</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on two metal ions inputs (Hg2+ and Li+) a networked six&#8208;component ensemble AND gate has been fabricated. The performance of the gate is evaluated by FRET emission of rhodamine receptor which is controlled by the logic operation of the gate. Application of only one input, does not produce any output result of the gate. Upon addition of both the inputs only, Cu+ ion is released to solution as primary output. The released Cu+ binds with the receptor and ignite a FRET transition. The strict stoichiometric inputs and output of the gate allowa highly defined communication between different parts of the gate. The smooth molecular cybernetics in the multicomponent ensemble is a lucid example that encourages us for further work in controlling intricate mutually dependent supramolecular devices or further complex logic circuits operation. A six&#8208;component AND gate using input of Hg2+ and Li+ ions releases stoichiometric Cu+ which triggers FRET emission in a rhodamine receptor upon binding. Only dual inputs activate the gate, demonstrating precise communication for complex molecular logic circuits.







Abstract
A networked supramolecular logic AND gate system is accomplished using precise chemical communication within a multicomponent ensemble via metal ion&#8208;driven self&#8208;sorting processes. The cybernetic AND gate is composed of a copper(I)&#8208;loaded nanoswitch, an aza&#8208;crown ether and a rhodamine receptor. The modus operandi of the AND gate, from state (0,0), was induced with stoichiometric amounts of two inputs (IN&#8208;1=Hg2+, IN&#8208;2=Li+) generating copper(I) ions as output only in state (1,1). Generation of state (1,1) from state (0,0) involves selective Cu+ ion translocation from the nanoswitch to the aza&#8208;crown ether in the first step (IN&#8208;1) and then from the aza&#8208;crown ether to the rhodamine receptor in the second step (IN&#8208;2). The released copper(I) output acts as a messenger that binds to the rhodamine receptor, triggering it's spiro&#8208;lactam ring opening, which leads to a diagnostic FRET emission from the copper(I)&#8208;loaded rhodamine scaffold accompanied by a remarkable fluorescence and colour change from pale yellow to pink.

         <title>Photooxidation of Toluene Derivatives under HAT and ROS Synergy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study synergistically combines hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation to achieve efficient photocatalytic oxidation of toluene derivatives with low catalyst loading as well as mild conditions, yielding benzoic acid derivatives and aryl ketones, thereby enhancing catalytic efficiency while ensuring both ecological sustainability and economic viability.







Abstract
The valorization of toluene offers a dual solution by addressing its environmental impact while also facilitating the synthesis of a diverse array of valuable fine chemicals and pharmaceutical intermediates, thus ensuring both ecological sustainability and economic viability. We report herein a synergistic approach that harmonizes hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process with the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under mild condition and low catalyst loading, which enables the efficient synthesis of a broad spectrum of esteemed benzoic acid derivatives and aryl ketones through the photocatalytic oxidation of toluene derivatives. Mechanistic elucidation reveals that the HAT reagent anthraquinone has both the capabilities to abstract hydrogen atoms and the ability to generate singlet oxygen (1O2) during energy transfer with triplet oxygen (3O2), and the combination of these two potencies significantly improves the catalytic efficiency of the reaction. This study not only introduces the amalgamation of HAT with ROS generation but also delineates a systematic approach for the selection of HAT reagents with energy transfer proficiency for ROS generation in catalytic oxidation reactions.

         <title>Regulatory Mechanisms and Synergistic Enhancement of the Diiron YtfE Protein in Nitric Oxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study investigates the YtfE protein in Escherichia coli, essential for mitigating nitrosative stress by converting nitric oxide to nitrous oxide. Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis reveals Tunnel 1 as the main substrate pathway regulated by N&#8208;terminal domain shifts, with Tunnel 2 acting as a backup route. Enhancing Tunnel 2 activity triples YtfE's efficiency, offering strategies to boost bacterial stress responses.







Abstract
The diiron&#8208;containing YtfE protein in Escherichia coli is pivotal in counteracting nitrosative stress, a critical barrier to bacterial viability. This study delves into the biochemical complexity governing YtfE's conversion of nitric oxide (NO) to nitrous oxide, a key process for alleviating nitrosative stress. Through site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, we explored YtfE's molecular structure, with a particular focus on two internal transport tunnels important for its activity. Our findings illuminate Tunnel 1 as the primary conduit for substrate transport, regulated by conformational shifts within the N&#8208;terminal domain that enable substrate access to the diiron core in the C&#8208;terminal domain. Tunnel 2 emerges as a secondary, supportive route, activated when Tunnel 1 is compromised. This result challenges a previous model of distinct tunnels for substrate entry and product exit, suggesting both tunnels are capable of transporting substrates and products. Our engineering efforts enhanced the role of Tunnel 2, enabling a synergistic operation with Tunnel 1 and tripling YtfE's enzymatic activity compared to its wild&#8208;type form. This research not only deepens our understanding of YtfE's regulatory mechanism for NO reduction but also introduces a strategy to amplify its enzymatic efficiency. The outcomes offer new ravenues for modulating bacterial stress responses.

         <title>Regioselective Electrochemical Construction of Csp2&#8722;Csp2 Linkage at C5&#8722;C5&#8217; Position of 2&#8208;Oxindoles via an Intermolecular Anodic Dehydrogenative Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly regioselective electrochemical homo&#8208;coupling strategy was developed for the synthesis of C5&#8722;C5&#8217; dimer of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;2&#8208;oxindole. Control experiments and cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies confirmed that C&#8722;C bond formation occurs via a radical&#8208;radical dimerization process. Density Functional Theory (DFT) studies validated the reaction mechanism and the observed high regioselectivity. The reaction conditions are mild and compatible with a wide range of functional groups.







Abstract
Applying electricity as a reagent in synthetic organic chemistry has attracted particular attention from synthetic chemists worldwide as an environmentally benign and cost&#8208;effective technique. Herein, we report the construction of the Csp2&#8722;Csp2 linkage at the C5&#8722;C5&#8217; position of 2&#8208;oxindole utilizing electricity as the traceless oxidant in an anodic dehydrogenative homo&#8208;coupling process. A variety of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;2&#8208;oxindoles were subjected to dimerization, achieving yields of up to 70&#8201;% through controlled potential electrolysis at an applied potential of 1.5&#8197;V versus Ag/Ag+ nonaqueous reference electrode. This electro&#8208;synthetic approach facilitates the specific assembly of C5&#8722;C5&#8217; (para&#8208;para coupled) dimer of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;2&#8208;oxindole without the necessity of any external oxidants or additives and DFT (Density Functional Theory) calculations provided confirmation of this pronounced regioselectivity. Furthermore, validation through control experiments and voltammetric analyses substantiated the manifestation of radical&#8208;radical coupling (or biradical pathway) for the dimerization process.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For decades, the synthesis of 2&#8208;quinolones, a crucial structural motif in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, has relied heavily on costly noble metal complexes and structurally complex ligands. Despite considerable efforts from synthetic chemists, a mild, metal&#8208;free, environmentally friendly, and cost&#8208;effective approach has remained elusive. This study introduces a robust, metal&#8208;free synthetic platform that leverages an innovative organoiodine&#8208;catalyzed electrophilic arene C(sp2)&#8208;H amination strategy to efficiently produce a wide range of new and modifiable 2&#8208;quinolones. Moreover, this study allows ready synthetic access to novel 8&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;quinolones, uncovering new chemical spaces with significant potential for medicinal applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Site&#8208;Selective Defluorinative Etherification between Unactivated Perfluoroarenes and Hydrobenzoxazoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyfluoroaryl ethers represent an important framework of biologically active molecules and materials. Owing to the strong bond dissociation energy of C&#8208;F bond, selectivity and other issues, transition metal&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of polyfluoroaryl ethers from perfluoroarenes via the activation of C&#8208;F bond is challenging and underdeveloped, as compared to the well&#8208;documented C&#8208;O bond formation starting from aryl iodides, aryl bromides or aryl chlorides. Herein, an unprecedented Pd&#8208;catalyzed defluorinative etherification for the synthesis of polyfluoroaryl ether skeletons using hydrobenzoxazoles as phenol surrogate, has been reported. The substrate scope for this protocol is broad, with respect to hydrobenzoxazoles and perfluoroarenes, under mild reaction conditions. More importantly, challenging alkenyl and alkynyl substituted polyfluoroarenes could be successfully used as the coupling component for Pd&#8208;catalyzed etherification reaction. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to investigate the reaction mechanism, which suggested that oxidative addition between polyfluorobenzene and Pd(0) constituted the ratedetermining step.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;Derived Tetracarboxylate Featuring AIE Properties for Dual Ion Sensing and Mechanochromic Self&#8208;Erasable Writing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The integration of multiple functions within a single fluorescent molecule provides a promising platform for developing versatile, efficient, and cost&#8208;effective materials with enhanced performance across diverse applications. In this study, we introduce TPEC, an aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) molecule derived from tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based tetracarboxylate, which demonstrates multifunctional capabilities, including metal ion sensing and self&#8208;erasable writing. TPEC exhibits amphiphilicity in water, self&#8208;assembling into single&#8208;layer nanosheets with robust blue fluorescence. Notably, the aqueous solution of TPEC displays a fluorescence colorimetric response to Al3+ ions and fluorescence quenching in the presence of Fe&#179;&#8314; ions. Additionally, TPEC powders undergo fluorescence colorimetric changes under mechanical stimulation, enabling self&#8208;erasable writing on prepared paper. This study presents a straightforward strategy for the development of multifunctional luminescent materials based on the self&#8208;assembly of a single&#8208;component fluorophore.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Clickable Isotactic Poly(vinyl ether)s through Organocatalytic Stereoselective Cationic Copolymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By virtue of the high reliability of click chemistry, polymers with clickable groups provide a useful platform for the rapid synthesis of polymer materials with diverse functionalities and architectures. However, the polymerization of clickable vinyl monomers with a concurrent regulation on tacticity remains underdeveloped. Herein, we report the successful development of a stereoselective cationic copolymerization of C&#8208;C triple bond&#8208;containing vinyl ethers with simple alkyl vinyl ethers by employing confined Br&#248;nsted acid as catalyst, which allows for the synthesis of alkyne&#8208;functionalized vinyl ether copolymers with high isotacticity (up to 90% m), controlled molecular weight, and variable content of C&#8208;C triple bonds. Further transformation of the pendant clickable alkyne groups via thiol&#8208;yne click reactions and copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition reaction enables a modular access to isotactic polymers with various functional groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Organocatalysed Synthesis of (R)&#8208;Mandelic Acid Esters and &#945;&#8208;Alkoxy Derivatives from Commercial Sources</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optically active mandelic acid esters represent a highly valuable class of building blocks in organic synthesis and recurrent motifs embedded in bioactive compounds and drugs. Herein, we provide an enantioselective one&#8208;pot synthesis based on Knoevenagel condensation/asymmetric epoxidation/domino ring&#8208;opening hydrolysis (DROH) sequence to the crude mandelic acids, which underwent a final esterification step to (R)&#8208;methyl mandelates. These products have been obtained in good to high overall yield and enantioselectivity, using commercially and widely available reagents and catalyst including aldehydes, phenylsulfonyl acetonitrile, cumyl hydroperoxide, water and an epi&#8208;quinine&#8208;derived urea as the organocatalyst. Moreover, the versatility of the process has been demonstrated to prepare the corresponding &#945;&#8208;alkoxy esters in highly enantioselective manner, when using primary alcohols in a domino ring&#8208;opening esterification (DROE) step. This system is a first example of non&#8208;enzymatic catalytic one&#8208;pot protocol which allows a straightforward asymmetric synthesis of highly valuable mandelic acid derivatives from aldehyde feedstocks.</dc:description>

         <title>Fortuitous Enantiomeric Self&#8208;Rectification of an Unreported Partial Racemisation in the Synthesis of a Chiral Phosphoric Acid: A Warning to Practitioners</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Research Article details a partial racemisation of a 3,3&#8217;&#8208;bis(phenanthrene) substituted BINOL during methoxymethyl (MOM) ether deprotection. Moreover, during phosphorylation of the (partially racemised) BINOL, it was found that a racemic intermediate phosphorochloridate precipitated, fortuitously reestablishing enantiopurity in the chiral phosphoric acid product.







Abstract
Racemisation without Consequence: MOM deprotection during a routine synthesis of phosphoric acid 1 promoted partial racemisation of the product BINOL 5. Surprisingly, however, after phosphorylation of the partially racemised BINOL, enantiopure acid 1 was isolated. Further inspection revealed that during phosphorylation, unhydrolysed racemic phosphorochloridate 6 precipitated, thus restoring homochirality in the product phosphoric acid 1. Moreover, MOM deprotection partial racemisation was avoided by conducting reactions at lower temperatures for no longer than the required deprotection time, and/or by application of other deprotection conditions from the literature.

         <title>Structural Regulation of a Multi&#8208;Component Co2P2O7&#8208;MoN/NC Electrocatalyst for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;component Co2P2O7&#8208;MoN/NC composite is successfully prepared by a facile two&#8208;step method. Co2P2O7&#8208;MoN/NC exhibits a superior OER performance in an alkaline medium, delivering an overpotential of 278&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a Tafel slope of 83.3&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, and long&#8208;term durability over 100&#8197;h. The structural synergy among pyrophosphate, nitride, N&#8208;doped carbon, and the new&#8208;formed CoOOH nanosheets prompts the enhancement of the OER performance significantly.







Abstract
Realizing efficient and durable non&#8208;precious metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) still remains a great challenge. Here, a multi&#8208;component composite of Co2P2O7&#8208;MoN/NC containing pyrophosphate, nitride, and nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon is successfully prepared via a facile two&#8208;step synthesis method. Combining the structural regulation between the active metal&#8208; and non&#8208;metal&#8208;based species, Co2P2O7&#8208;MoN/NC demonstrates superior activity and durability for OER, requiring an overpotential of 278&#8197;mV at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a Tafel slope of 83.3&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, and long&#8208;term stability over 100&#8197;h in an alkaline solution. Post&#8208;characterizations reveal that synergistic effect among stable Co2P2O7, partially dissolved MoN, N&#8208;doped carbon, and new&#8208;formed CoOOH nanosheets enable structural reconstruction, fast charge transfer, and formation of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates, promoting the OER performance significantly. This work provides a promising pathway to tune multi&#8208;components to fabricate efficient transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts in energy conversion applications.

         <title>Role of Solvent and Noncovalent Interactions in Alkaline Reactivity of Strained and Strain&#8208;Free Macrocyclic Disulfides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insights from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solution elucidate apparent contradiction by revealing different solvent exposures of the two sulfur atoms in two isomers of the same macrocycle and even though the disulfide bond in one isomer is stretched, its reactivity is not enhanced.







Abstract
This study employs ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the impact of solvent and noncovalent interactions on the structure&#8208;reactivity relationship of both strain&#8208;free and strained macrocyclic disulfides. Our findings reveal that interactions with water as a solvent significantly influence the minimum energy geometry structures of both conformers of the studied macrocycle. In particular, our simulations identify short contacts, specifically S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;&#8208;aromatic interactions, which suppress reactivity for the strained isomer by obstructing the reaction cone at the minimum free energy. Surprisingly, the free energy barriers for the disulfide reaction with a simple nucleophile (OH&#8722; anion) remain very similar, despite one conformer having a markedly more strained disulfide bond than the other. Enhanced molecular dynamics simulations in an explicit solution elucidate this apparent contradiction by revealing different solvent exposures of the two sulfur atoms in the macrocycles.

         <title>Targeted and Untargeted Amine Metabolite Quantitation in Single Cells with Isobaric Multiplexing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
We developed a single cell amine analysis approach utilizing isobarically multiplexed samples of 6 individual cells along with analyte abundant carrier. This methodology was applied for absolute quantitation of amino acids and untargeted relative quantitation of amines in a total of 108 individual cells using nanoflow LC with high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry. Together with individually determined cell sizes, this provides accessible quantification of intracellular amino acid concentrations within individual cells. The targeted method was partially validated for 10 amino acids with limits of detection in low attomoles, linear calibration range covering analyte amounts typically from 30&#8197;amol to 120&#8197;fmol, and correlation coefficients (R) above 0.99. This was applied with cell sizes recorded during dispensing to determine millimolar intracellular amino acid concentrations. The untargeted approach yielded 249 features that were detected in at least 25&#8201;% of the single cells, providing modest cell type separation on principal component analysis. Using Greedy forward selection with regularized least squares, a sub&#8208;selection of 100 features explaining most of the difference was determined. These features were annotated using MS2 from analyte standards and accurate mass with library search. The approach provides accessible, sensitive, and high&#8208;throughput method with the potential to be expanded also to other forms of ultrasensitive analysis.

Light&#8208;assisted assembly: The photosubstitution reactions of a ruthenium precursor complex with bridging ligands having pyrazole moieties afford oligomeric ruthenium complexes. The photochemically synthesized ruthenium complexes act as synthons for longer metal&#8208;complex&#8208;based nanowires with a length of the order of tens&#8208;of nanometers.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled oligonuclear and polynuclear complexes have numerous functionalities and potential applications. Generally, such compounds have been constructed by thermal substitution reactions with bridging ligands. Herein, we report bottom&#8208;up and photochemical construction of functional coordination oligomers and polymers by photosubstitution&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly. The photosubstitution reactions of a ruthenium precursor complex with bridging ligands having pyrazole moieties afford mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, and pentanuclear ruthenium complexes, Ru1&#8211;Ru5, which have one&#8208;dimensional architectures. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding between each bridging ligand is a key to construct the molecular nanowires. All the complexes have been isolated and thoroughly characterized. The photochemically synthesized ruthenium complexes act as synthons for longer metal&#8208;complex&#8208;based nanowires with a length of the order of tens&#8208;of nanometers. The multinuclear complexes are generated by photoinduced self&#8208;assembly in the presence of a base, and they undergo photoinduced disassembly in the presence of acid.

         <title>Tuning the Reactivity of Copper(II)&#8211;Nitrite Core Towards Nitric Oxide Generation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Donor properties of a set of tridentate ligands have been illustrated to tune the oxygen&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer (OAT) and proton&#8208;coupled&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer (PCET) reactivity profiles of copper(II)&#8211;nitrite complexes towards the evolution of NO gas in the presence of phosphine and substituted phenols, respectively.







Abstract
Insights into the molecular mechanism and factors affecting nitrite&#8208;to&#8208;NO transformation at transition metal sites are essential for developing sustainable technologies relevant to NO&#8208;based therapeutics, waste water treatment, and agriculture. A set of copper(II)&#8211;nitrite complexes 1&#8211;4 have been isolated employing tridentate pincer&#8208;type ligands (quL, pyL, ClArOL&#8722;, PhOL&#8722;) featuring systematically varied donors. Although the X&#8208;ray crystal structures of the copper(II)&#8211;nitrite cores in 1&#8211;4 are comparable, electrochemical studies on complexes 1&#8211;4 reveal that redox properties of these complexes differ due to the changes in the &#963;&#8208;donor abilities of the phenolate/N&#8208;heterocycle based donor sites. Reactivity of these nitrite complexes with oxygen&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer (OAT) reagent (e.&#8201;g. triphenyl phosphine Ph3P) and H+/e&#8722; donor reagent (e.&#8201;g. substituted phenols ArOH) show the reduction of nitrite to NO gas. Detailed kinetic investigations including kinetic isotope effect (KIE), Eyring analyses for determining the activation parameters unfold that reduction of nitrite at copper(II) by Ph3P or ArOH are influenced by the CuII/CuI redox potential. Finally, this study allows mechanism driven development of catalytic nitrite reduction by ArOH in the presence of 10&#8197;mol&#8201;% copper complex (1).

         <title>Simultaneous Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction and H2O Oxidation Under Non&#8208;Sacrificial Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simultaneous photocatalytic CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation under non&#8208;sacrificial ambient conditions is important and challenging. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the two half&#8208;reactions of CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation in photocatalytic CO2 conversion, highlighting the dual&#8208;site photocatalyst design and the key techniques to explore the redox mechanisms at reaction intermediates and excited&#8208;state dynamics.







Abstract
The utilization of CO2, H2O, and solar energy is regarded as a sustainable route for converting CO2 into chemical feedstocks, paving the way for carbon neutrality and reclamation. However, the simultaneous photocatalytic CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation under non&#8208;sacrificial ambient conditions is still a significant challenge. Researchers have carried out extensive exploration and achieved dramatic developments in this area. In this review, we first primarily elucidate the principles of two half&#8208;reactions in the photocatalytic conversion of CO2 with H2O, i.&#8201;e., CO2 reduction by the photo&#8208;generated electrons and protons, and H2O oxidation by the photo&#8208;generated holes without sacrificial agents. Subsequently, the strategies to promote two half&#8208;reactions are summarized, including the vacancy/facet/morphology design, adjacent redox site construction, and Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction development. Finally, we present the advanced in&#8197;situ characterizations and future perspectives in this field. This review aims to provide fresh insights into effectively simultaneous photocatalytic CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation under non&#8208;sacrificial ambient conditions.

         <title>Pro&#8208;aromatic Natural Terpenes as Unusual &#8220;Slingshot&#8221; Antioxidants with Promising Ferroptosis Inhibition Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pro&#8208;aromatic terpene &#947;&#8208;terpinene &#8208; present as minor component in essential oils &#8208; shows antioxidant activity in micelles and liposomes, and protects cells from ferroptosis, by an unprecedented &#8220;slingshot&#8221; mechanism, due to its ability to react with radicals in the lipidic region forming, after fragmentation and aromatization, the HOO&#8901; radical that escapes from the membrane blocking the radical chain.







Abstract
Ferroptosis is a cell death mechanism based on extensive cellular membrane peroxidation, implicated in neurodegenerative and other diseases. The essential oil component &#947;&#8208;terpinene, a natural monoterpene with a unique highly oxidizable pro&#8208;aromatic 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene skeleton, inhibits peroxidation of polyunsaturated lipid in model heterogeneous systems (micelles and liposomes). Upon H&#8208;atom abstraction, an unstable &#947;&#8208;terpinene&#8208;derived peroxyl radical is formed, that aromatizes to p&#8208;cymene generating HOO&#8901; radicals. As HOO&#8901; are small and hydrophilic radicals, they quickly diffuse outside the lipid core, blocking the radical chain propagation of polyunsaturated lipids. This unprecedented antioxidant &#8220;slingshot&#8221; mechanism explains why &#947;&#8208;terpinene shows a protective activity against ferroptosis, being effective at submicromolar concentrations in human neuroblastoma (SH&#8208;SY5Y) cells.

         <title>Fluorination or Not in Small Molecule Solar Cells: Achieving a Higher Efficiency with Halogen&#8208;Free End Group</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two readily accessible and scalable end groups for small molecule donors are developed. The resulting fluorine&#8208;free SBz and fluorine&#8208;containing SBz&#8722;F were blended with Y6 for small molecule organic solar cells (SM&#8208;OSCs). Surprisingly, the fluorine&#8208;containing SBz&#8722;F:Y6 OSCs exhibit a lower efficiency than that of the SBz:Y6 OSCs (9.61&#8201;% vs 11.05&#8201;%).







Abstract
Fluorination is an efficient strategy for improving organic solar cells (OSCs) efficiency, particularly by fluorinating the end group of emerging nonfullerene acceptors. Here, the fluorination effect was investigated by using small molecule donors with fluorine&#8208;free (SBz) and fluorinated (SBz&#8208;F) end groups, paired with the emerging nonfullerene acceptor Y6. Interestingly and unexpectedly, fluorination of the end group negatively affects OSCs efficiency, with fluorine&#8208;free SBz:Y6 OSCs achieving a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.05&#8201;% compared to the fluorine&#8208;containing SBz&#8208;F:Y6 blends (PCE=9.61&#8201;%). Analysis of space&#8208;charge limited currents reveals lower and unbalanced hole/electron mobility in SBz&#8208;F:Y6 compared to the SBz:Y6 blends. These findings are further supported by charge recombination dynamics and donor&#8208;acceptor miscibility analyses.

         <title>Modulating the Supramolecular Assembly of &#945;&#8208;Cyclodextrin and Anderson&#8208;type Polyoxometalate through Covalent Modifications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of unprecedented supramolecular complexes of covalently modified Anderson&#8208;type polyoxometalates (POMs) and &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrins (&#945;&#8208;CDs) have been obtained and characterized in solid state by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, and in aqueous solution using various techniques including 1H DOSY, 2D NOESY 1H NMR, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and electrospray ionization time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectroscopy (ESI&#8208;TOF&#8208;MS). It has been demonstrated that the supramolecular assembly process can be modulated by different covalent modification modes of the Anderson POMs, giving rise to a new type of POM/&#945;&#8208;CD complexes featuring organic&#8208;inorganic pseudo&#8208;rotaxane structures, which are in good contrast to those of POM/&#947;&#8208;CD with poly&#8208;rotaxane type structures.

         <title>Toughening Healable Supramolecular Double Polymer Networks Based on Hydrogen Bonding and Metal Coordination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report supramolecular polymer double networks (DNs) based on poly(n&#8208;butyl acrylate)s featuring orthogonally responsive 2&#8208;ureido&#8208;4[1H]pyrimidinone (UPy) and 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 complexes between 2,6&#8208;bis(1&#8242;&#8208;methylbenzimidazolyl)pyridine (MeBip) ligand and Zn2+ ions as cross&#8208;links. The supramolecular DN exhibits thermal stability, creep resistance, excellent healability, and improved elongation and toughness.







Abstract
Double polymer networks (DNs) consist of two interpenetrating polymer networks and can offer properties that are not merely a sum of the parts. Here, we report an elastic DN made from two supramolecular polymers (SMPs) that consist of the same poly(n&#8208;butyl acrylate) (BA) backbone. The two polymers feature different non&#8208;covalent binding motifs, which form dynamic, reversible cross&#8208;links. The polymers were prepared by reversible addition&#8722;fragmentation chain&#8208;transfer polymerization of n&#8208;butyl acrylate and either the self&#8208;complementary hydrogen&#8208;bonding motif 2&#8208;ureido&#8208;4[1H]pyrimidinone, or the 2,6&#8208;bis(1&#8242;&#8208;methylbenzimidazolyl)pyridine ligand, which forms complexes with metal ions. The supramolecular DN made by these components combines features of the single networks, including high thermal stability and resistance to creep. The DN further exhibits excellent healability and displays a higher extensibility and a higher toughness than its constituents. The mechanical characteristics of the DN can be further enhanced by selectively pre&#8208;stretching one of the networks, which is readily possible due to the reversible formation of the supramolecular cross&#8208;links and their orthogonal stimuli&#8208;responsiveness.

The polymers were prepared by reversible addition&#8722;fragmentation chain-transfer polymerization of &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-butyl acrylate and either the self-complementary hydrogen-bonding motif 2-ureido-4[1H]pyrimidinone, or the 2,6-bis(1&#8242;-methylbenzimidazolyl)pyridine ligand, which forms complexes with metal ions. The supramolecular DN made by these components combines features of the single networks, including high thermal stability and resistance to creep. The DN further exhibits excellent healability and displays a higher extensibility and a higher toughness than its constituents. The mechanical characteristics of the DN can be further enhanced by selectively pre-stretching one of the networks, which is readily possible due to the reversible formation of the supramolecular cross-links and their orthogonal stimuli-responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electronic Structure Modulating of W18O49 Nanospheres by Niobium Doping for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized Nb&#8208;doped W18O49 (Nbx&#8208;W18O49) electrocatalysts via a &#8220;one pot&#8221; solvothermal method. In 0.5&#8197;M H2SO4, Nb0.6&#8208;W18O49 achieved a low overpotential of 102&#8197;mV at &#8722;10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope of 65.1&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1. It also showed excellent stability and durability for 20&#8197;h.







Abstract
Hydrogen, known for its high energy density and environmental benefits, serves as a prime substitute for fossil fuels. Nonetheless, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), essential in electrolysis, encounters challenges with slow kinetics and significant overpotential, which elevate costs and reduce efficiency. Thus, developing efficient electrocatalysts to reduce HER overpotential is vital to enhance hydrogen production efficiency and minimize energy consumption. Adjusting the electronic structure of transition metal oxides via elemental doping is a potent strategy to improve the effectiveness of electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution. In this work, we synthesized a set of niobium&#8208;doped tungsten oxides (Nbx&#8208;W18O49) under anoxic conditions using a straightforward &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; solvothermal approach. After doping Nb, the oxygen vacancy content inside W18O49 was increased, which induced a synergistic effect with the active sites of tungsten. In acidic environments, the hydrogen evolution activity of the Nb0.6&#8208;W18O49 electrocatalyst is second only by 20&#8197;wt&#8201;% Pt/C. It attains a current density of &#8722;10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at an overpotential of 102&#8197;mV. By comparison with W18O49, Nb0.4&#8208;W18O49 and Nb0.5&#8208;W18O49, Nb0.6&#8208;W18O49 demonstrates a reduced charge transfer resistance, which significantly enhances its conductivity and the speed of electron movement across interfaces. Coupled with this feature are notably faster HER kinetics. Additionally, it exhibits excellent stability, meaning it maintains its performance and structural integrity over prolonged periods and under various operational conditions. This article provides a new perspective for discovering inexpensive and efficient hydrogen evolution electrocatalyst materials.

         <title>Mass Spectrometry&#8208;Based Platforms for Protein Lipoxidation Profiling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein lipoxidation, a kind of protein post&#8208;translational modification mainly produced under cellular oxidative stress, plays a significant regulatory role in the structure and function of protein. This review describes the source and pathophysiological effects of protein lipoxidation, highlights developments and applications of the detection strategies especially MS&#8208;based chemoproteomic technologies of LDE&#8208;protein adducts and discusses challenges in this field.







Abstract
Lipid peroxidation, occurring through enzymatic or non&#8208;enzymatic processes, generates lipid&#8208;derived electrophiles (LDEs), which can covalently modify nucleophilic amino acid residues in proteins, a process known as protein lipoxidation. This modification can alter protein structure and function, either causing damage or regulating signalling pathways. Identifying the protein targets and specific lipoxidation sites provide important clues for unveiling the oxidative stress&#8208;related protein interaction network and molecular mechanisms of related diseases. In this review, we present a detailed overview of recent advances in protein LDE modification profiling, with a focus on mass spectrometry (MS)&#8208;based chemoproteomic platforms for global protein lipoxidation profiling.

         <title>A Reusable Polystyrene Support for Sustainable yet Cost&#8208;effective Octreotide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid phase synthesis of cyclic peptide drugs derived from disulfide tethers is challenging. A soluble polystyrene support with spacer units between sites of peptide synthesis enables on&#8208;support disulfide cyclization to afford the drug octreotide in good yield and high purity. The protocol is scalable, minimizes reagent waste and reduces raw&#8208;material cost. The support can also be recycled offering a sustainable yet cost&#8208;effective approach for octreotide synthesis.







Abstract
The synthesis of peptide drugs has become facile with the use of supports that enable easy separation of the growing peptide. Peptide synthesis on insoluble supports typically employs excess reagents to enhance reaction efficiency and faces challenges during intramolecular cyclization. A non&#8208;crosslinked soluble polystyrene support is reported herein that improves cyclization efficiency on the support by using spacers. The support efficiency is illustrated by synthesizing octreotide drug in a scalable manner by on&#8208;support cyclization. The methodology drastically reduces the reagent waste, raw&#8208;material cost, and solvent requirement. The support can also be recovered and re&#8208;used up to 3 times making this a very sustainable method.

The ternary OSCs showed PCE of 18.05&#8201;%, is attributed to utilization of energy transfer from NFA&#8208;5 to NFA&#8208;4 in the ternary active layer, suppressed charge recombinations and low energy loss.







Abstract
Here in, we have designed two new unfused non&#8208;fullerene small molecules using asymmetric benzo[1,2&#8208;b:3.4&#8208;b&#8242;, 6,5&#8208;b&#8221;]trithiophene (BTT) as the central donor core and different terminal units i.&#8201;e., 2&#8208;(3&#8208;oxo&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;inden&#8208;1&#8208;ylidene)malononitrile (NFA&#8208;4) and 1,3&#8208;diethyl&#8208;2&#8208;thioxodi hydropyrimidine&#8208;4,6 (1H,5H)&#8208;dione (NFA&#8208;5) and examined their optical and electrochemical properties. Using a wide band&#8208;gap copolymer D18, organic solar cells (OSCs) based on bulk heterojunction of D18:NFA&#8208;4 and D18:NFA&#8208;5 showed overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) of about 17.07&#8201;% and 11.27&#8201;%, respectively. The increased PCE for the NFA&#8208;4&#8208;based OSC, compared to NFA&#8208;5 counterpart, is due higher value of short circuit current (JSC), open circuit voltage (VOC), and fill factor (FF). Following the addition of small amount of NFA&#8208;5 to the binary bulk heterojunction D18:NFA&#8208;4, the ternary organic solar cells attained a PCE of 18.05&#8201;%, surpassing that of the binary counterparts due to the higher values of which is higher than that for the binary counterparts and attributed to the increased values of JSC, FF, and VOC. The higher value of JSC is linked to the efficient use to excitons transferred from NFA&#8208;5 to NFA&#8208;4 with a greated dipole moment than NFA&#8208;5 and subsequently dissociated into a free charge carrier efficiently.

         <title>Engineering Phi29&#8208;DNAP Variants for Customized DNA Hydrogel Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New phi29 DNA polymerase variants for RCA&#8208;based DNA hydrogel production are developed, featuring modified binding properties and the ability to incorporate non&#8208;natural nucleotides with potential for generating advanced materials. Their synthesis performance and the ability to incorporate various non&#8208;natural nucleotides modified at the nucleobase or sugar moiety for the production of DNA hydrogels are evaluated and comprehensively characterized by qPCR, micromechanical indentation, and HPLC







Abstract
DNA hydrogels, which hold potential for use in medicine, biosensors, and tissue engineering, can be produced through enzymatic rolling circle amplification (RCA) using phi29 DNA polymerase (DNAP). This paper introduces new DNAP variants designed for RCA&#8208;based DNA hydrogel production, featuring enzymes with modified DNA binding, enhanced thermostability, reduced exonuclease activity, and protein tags for fluorescence detection or specific immobilization. We evaluated these enzymes by quantifying DNA output via quantitative PCR (qPCR) and assessing hydrogel mechanical properties through micromechanical indentation. The results showed that most variants generated similar DNA amounts and hydrogels with comparable mechanical properties. Additionally, all variants successfully incorporated non&#8208;natural nucleotides, such as base&#8208;modified dGTP derivatives and 2&#8242;fluoro&#8208;dGTP, during RCA. This study's robust analytical approach offers a strong foundation for selecting new enzymes and producing DNA hydrogels with tailored material properties.

         <title>Enhancing Phototoxicity in BODIPY&#8208;Perylene Charge Transfer Dyads by Combined Iodination and Mesylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a family of BODIPY&#8208;perylene charge transfer compounds with and without iodination and/or a mesityl group. The BODIPY derivatives reported show high phototoxicity in both 2D cell cultures and multicellular tumour spheroids, where MB2PI (iodinated BODIPY&#8208;perylene with a mesityl group) was the most phototoxic derivative, indicating that combining strategies to enhance phototoxicity can yield positive results.







Abstract
The uptake and phototoxicity of a family of BODIPY&#8208;perylene charge transfer dyads are compared in live cancer and non&#8208;cancer cell lines to evaluate their performance in imaging and photodynamic therapy (PDT). The impact of iodination and mesylation of the meso position of the compounds on their optical properties, cell uptake and toxicity are compared. Notably, across all derivatives the probes were minimally dark toxic up to 50&#8197;&#956;M, (the maximum concentration tested), but exhibited outstanding phototoxicity with nanomolar IC50 values and impressive phototoxic indices (PI, ratio of dark IC50 to light IC50), with best performance for the mesylated iodinated derivative MB2PI, which had a PI of &gt;218 and &gt;8.9 in MCF&#8208;7 cells and tumour spheroids respectively. This is significantly higher than non&#8208;iodinated analogue MB2P in MCF&#8208;7 cells with an observed PI of &gt;109 and slightly higher than MB2PI in spheroids with a PI of &gt;8. This compound also showed interesting emission spectral variation with localisation that responded to stimulation of inflammation. Additional studies confirmed efficient singlet oxygen generation by the BODIPYs, suggesting a Type II mechanism of phototoxicity. Overall, the data indicates that combining charge transfer and iodination is an effective strategy for enhancing phototherapeutic capacity of BODIPY PS.

         <title>Photochemistry with Plane&#8208;Polarized Light: Controlling Selectivity of a Photochemical Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unidirectional alignment of photoreactive compounds in the nematic liquid crystal solutions enables controlling their photochemistry upon irradiation with the plane&#8208;polarized light. In this work, we demonstrate control over the preferential aryl group migration in the photochemical type B enone rearrangement. This approach provides a novel tool to direct photochemical reactivity and attenuate selectivity of the photochemical reactions.







Abstract
Over the past 50&#8197;years, a principal approach to controlling conventional photochemical reactions has relied on imposing geometric constraints on reactant or transition state via conducting photochemistry in the organized or constraining media. Herein, we describe a fundamentally different approach to affect the course of photochemical reactions (photochemical rearrangements) by utilizing spatially selective excitation of specific electronic transitions with plane&#8208;polarized light in the reactant molecules uniformly aligned in the nematic liquid crystal phase. In particular, we focused on the Type B enone rearrangement of 4,4&#8208;diarylcyclohexenones &#8211; one of the most common photochemical rearrangements. We demonstrated that the aryl migratory aptitude in this reaction was attenuated in response to changing an angle between the polarization plane of the incident light and the alignment direction of the nematic liquid crystal, with the enhanced aryl migration achieved when the polarization plane coincided with the transition dipole moment leading to the excited state responsible for this migration. The spatially&#8208;selective initial excitation therefore was overruling the electronic factors responsible for the relative ratio of the two alternative photoproducts. The experimental findings were further supported by the results of a computational study. This work showcases a new fundamental paradigm in controlling photochemical reactivity and selectivity of photoreactions.

         <title>The Changing Phases of Bromopentafluorobenzene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Completely Phased? The study of the solid&#8208;state phase behaviour of a simple molecule such as C6F5Br can be something of a mystery when kinetic factors compete with thermodynamic behaviour, especially when weak non&#8208;covalent interactions dominate the crystal structures. Our experimental studies have solved three phases. Perhaps computational studies can unlock the fourth?







Abstract
As part of a much larger study on non&#8208;covalent interactions in binary adducts, we have explored the solid&#8208;state structures of bromopentafluorobenzene (C6F5Br) using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), variable&#8208;temperature powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (VT&#8208;PXRD), and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SXD). DSC data initially indicated a single solid&#8208;state phase below the freezing point, but revealed additional weak transitions upon heating. The crystal structures of three solid&#8208;state phases have been solved. The SXD data showed that phases I and IV are centrosymmetric, whilst phase II is polar. However, the structure of phase III remains elusive due to the changing phase behaviour of C6F5Br that is determined as much as by kinetics as thermodynamics. The results underline the need for multiple analytical techniques to study non&#8208;covalent interactions and offer valuable data for refining computational models in crystal structure prediction and machine learning. A comparison with the iodinated counterpart is also made.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Induced Aromatic Substitution: A Study on Guanidino&#8208;Functionalized Aromatics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidation of a redox&#8208;active aromatic molecule leads to an umpolung from a nucleophile to an electrophile, enabling addition of a nucleophile as part of an aromatic substitution. Thereby a variety of new, non&#8208;symmetrically substituted redox&#8208;active compounds could be synthesized. Several reactions of redox&#8208;active guanidino&#8208;substituted benzene molecules are reported. In some cases redox&#8208;induced aromatic substitution is part of a reaction cascade.







Abstract
Aromatic substitution of redox&#8208;active aromatic compounds could be initiated by a preceding redox step. We report on the different reaction pathways of such redox&#8208;induced substitution (RIAS) reactions between a redox&#8208;active guanidino&#8208;functionalized aromatic molecule (GFA) and an amine or guanidine. Oxidation of the GFA leads to an umpolung of the guanidine from a nucleophile to an electrophile and thereby enables addition of the amine or guanidine. Several examples are given, demonstrating the use of redox substitution in synthetic chemistry, e.&#8201;g. for the convenient synthesis of novel N&#8208;heteropolycyclic molecules and unsymmetrically&#8208;substituted aromatics.

Abstract
Incorporation of a thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene into an isophlorinoid&#8208;like framework alters the aromaticity by extending the macrocyclic &#960;&#8208;circuit. Their opto&#8208;electronic and aromatic properties significantly differ from other 22&#960; and 34&#960; porphyrinoids. Among the three different 34&#960; hexaphyrins, furan based hexaphyrin adopts a non&#8208;aromatic &#8216;figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight&#8217; conformation. Replacing all the furans either by thiophene or selenophene induces a planar conformation with aromatic characteristics. Spectro&#8208;electrochemical studies revealed reversible two&#8208;electron ring oxidation to yield their 4n&#960; dicationic species respectively.

         <title>Bifunctional Hexadentate Pyclen&#8211;Based Chelating Agent for Mild Radiofluorination in Aqueous Solution at Room Temperature with a Ga&#8208;18F Ternary Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two pyclen&#8208;based Ga3+ complexes resolved by X&#8208;Ray crystallography showed a heptacoordination ability deviating from the recognized hexacoordination. This feature supports the suitability of these chelating agents for the Ga&#8208;18F species. Radiolabeling by coordination of Ga&#8208;18F was successfully achieved in water and at pH&#8197;5, at room temperature, with 86&#8201;% radioconversion in 20&#8197;minutes and a radiochelate stability demonstrated for at least one hour.







Abstract
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is used in oncology for tumor diagnosis, commonly relying on fluorine&#8208;18 (18F) emission detection. The conventional method of 18F incorporation on to probes by covalent bonding is harsh for sensitive biomolecules, which are nonetheless compounds of choice for the development of targeted probes. This study explores gallium&#8211;18F (Ga18F) coordination, a milder alternative method occurring in aqueous media at the final stage of radiosyntheses. Pyclen&#8208;based chelating agents were proposed to capture (GaF) species at room temperature and pH&#8805;5 making the radiofluorination process compatible with heat&#8208; and acid&#8208;sensitive biomolecules. Highly promising results were obtained with the PC2A&#8211;based chelating agent LH2 derived from the new bifunctional PC2A&#8211;OAE&#8211;NCS compound. The solid&#8208;state structure of GaF(L) was elucidated by X&#8208;ray diffraction and revealed an unconventional heptacoordination of Ga(III). A high radiochemical conversion (RCC) of 86&#8201;% was achieved at room temperature, in water at pH&#8197;5 within 20&#8197;minutes. Stability studies showed the robustness of the GaF(L) complex in aqueous media for at least one day and at least one hour for the radiolabeled analog Ga18F(L). These findings demonstrated that PC2A&#8208;based compounds are chelating agents of choice for (Ga18F) species, suggesting a real technological breakthrough for PET imaging and precision medicine.

         <title>Insights into the Synergistic Catalytic Effect of TiO2 Supported V&#8208;W Oxides for Selective C&#8722;H Bond Oxidation of Cyclohexane to KA Oil</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The TiO2 supported V&#8722;W bimetallic oxides catalyst was prepared and used for the catalytic oxidation of cyclohexane to KA oil with H2O2 as an oxidant, and the prepared catalyst exhibited satisfactory catalytic activity owing to the synergistic effect between V and W.







Abstract
It is urgent to develop an efficient and stable non&#8208;noble metal catalyst for selective C&#8722;H bond oxidation of cyclohexane. Herein, a series of V&#8722;W oxides supported on TiO2 catalysts (V&#8722;W/TiO2) were fabricated. The V&#8722;W/TiO2 catalysts exhibited much higher catalytic activity for the selective oxidation of cyclohexane to KA oil, compared to that of V/TiO2 and W/TiO2 catalysts. The good distribution of active metals and the synergistic effect were responsible for the enhanced catalytic activity. H2&#8208;TPR results disclosed that the presence of V in V&#8722;W/TiO2 affected the reducibility of W6+ species, and XPS verified that an electronic interaction was formed between them. Such results led to good catalytic reusability of V&#8722;W/TiO2 catalyst during the reactions, and no obvious activity loss was found after six runs. The reaction mechanism was investigated, and the results verified that hydroxyl radicals generated from H2O2 homolysis were the main active oxidative species. Theoretical study revealed that V dopant could regulate electronic structure of adjacent O atom, facilitating the adsorption of cyclohexane, and lower energy was needed for the rate&#8208;limiting step over V&#8722;W/TiO2 during the whole oxidation reaction. This work developed an efficient V&#8722;W/TiO2 catalyst for the selective oxidation of cyclohexane via a synergistic effect.

         <title>HOST&#8208;GUEST INTERACTIONS FACILITATED BY CHALCOGEN BONDING WITHIN SELENADIAZOLE FUNCTIONALISED PORPHYRIN NANOTUBES</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structural rigidity of tetrakis(4&#8208;pyridyl)porphyrin (TPyP) has been utilised to prepare a robust novel porous coordination polymer of composition Cd2(TPyP)(sez)2 (TPyP = 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;pyridyl)porphyrin, sez = 1,2,5&#8208;benzoselenadiazole&#8208;5&#8208;carboxylate). The coordination polymer may be described as a hexagonal porphyrin nanotube (PNT) and has the potential to bind guest molecules through chalcogen bonding. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) data indicate an internal pore diameter ~9 &#197; which represents ~35% of the crystal volume. Immersion of the PNTs in solvents such as DMSO and CS2 result in the incorporation of these molecules within the nanotubes with chalcogen bonding between host and guest. The crystallographic guest&#8208;inclusion investigations are complemented by solid&#8208;state 77Se, 13C, 113Cd and 2H NMR studies which provide insights into dynamic behaviour. The porosity of the crystals was further explored using gas adsorption experiments, indicating the reversible uptake of CO2, CH4, H2 and N2. Structure&#8208;function relationships are clearly established from complementary crystallographic, NMR and adsorption investigations.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of materials composed by coordinative interactions between metal ions and organic linkers, encompassing two&#8208;dimensional (2D), and three&#8208;dimensional (3D) architectures. Metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs), a special case of these species, are discrete molecular &#8220;capsules&#8221; with zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) structures. Over the last two decades, MOFs and MOCs composed of organic perylene (P) and perylene diimide (PDI) linkers have gained much attention due to their versatile properties, which can be further enhanced after incorporation into the frameworks. This minireview highlights recent progress in the construction and application of P/PDI&#8208;based coordination framework materials. The text offers an overview of the synthesis of P/PDI organic linkers, proceeds to their integration into coordination frameworks of different dimensionalities &#8208; 2D and 3D MOFs, and 0D MOCs, and then explores potential applications. These include sensing, photocatalysis, electrochemical devices as well as photothermal conversion and focus on the apparent structure&#8208;property relationships. Finally, the challenges and future prospects of P/PDI&#8208;derived coordination frameworks will be addressed.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactivity of Polynuclear Niobium Oxynitride Cluster Anions Nb4N5&#8208;xOx&#8722; (x=0&#8211;5) toward N2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Significant regulation of the reactivity of polynuclear niobium oxynitride clusters with the N/O ratio was observed experimentally. By the complementary of quantum chemistry calculations, the uncommon side&#8208;on/end&#8208;on coordination mode of N2 on the dual metal centers was identified and the natural charge environment at the active sites resulting from the modulation of N/O ratio is responsible for the reactivity variation.







Abstract
The activation of N&#8322; under mild conditions remains a significant challenge in chemistry. Understanding how the composition of ligands modulates the reactivity of metal centers is pivotal for the rational design of efficient catalysts for nitrogen fixation. Herein, the reactions between polynuclear niobium oxynitride anions Nb4N5&#8208;xOx&#8722; (x=0&#8211;5) and N2 were investigated by employing mass spectrometry, photoelectron imaging spectroscopy, and theoretical calculations. The rate constants of Nb4N5&#8208;xOx&#8722;/N2 gradually decrease for x=0 to x=4, and then increase again for x=5. The sharp increase of the rate constants of Nb4O5&#8722;/N2 corresponds to a decrease in the electron detachment energy of the Nb4O5&#8722; cluster in the photoelectron spectroscopic experiments. Theoretical calculations suggest that the low&#8208;coordinated Nb&#8722;Nb sites in Nb4N5&#8208;xOx&#8722; (x=0&#8211;5) behaves as the active centers to bind N2 in the side&#8208;on/end&#8208;on manner. Mechanistic analysis reveals that reducing the N/O ratio leads to higher electron densities on the active Nb&#8722;Nb centers and decreased positive charge on the metal atoms, which hinders the approach of N2 to the clusters. This finding discloses fundamental insights into the impact of N/O ratio in fine&#8208;tuning the reactivity of metal centers toward N2 adsorption in related catalytic processes.

         <title>CO2 Dynamics in a Flexible Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Gate&#8208;Opening Phenomenon</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy was used to investigate CO2 dynamics in ELM&#8208;11 MOF during the gate&#8208;opening process. At low CO2 loading, it intercalates and adsorbs at a one site, causing slight interlayer opening. At high CO2 loading, the gate fully opens, allowing two types of CO2 to motion between the much expanded interlayers.







Abstract
As a promising porous material for CO2 adsorption and storage, elastic layer&#8208;structured metal&#8208;organic framework&#8208;11 (ELM&#8208;11) has attracted significant attention owing to its distinct gate&#8208;opening phenomenon. There is a sharp increase in CO2 uptake once reaching the gate&#8208;opening threshold pressure. To better understand this gate&#8208;opening mechanism, we investigated its transition process from the perspective of CO2 dynamics and its interaction with the framework via variable&#8208;temperature 13C solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Our findings revealed that during the gate&#8208;opening process, CO2 is initially strongly adsorbed at one site when the gate only slightly opens, while two distinct types of CO2 molecules exist when the gate fully opens. 11B, 13C, and 19F magic&#8208;angle spinning NMR, in conjunction with in&#8208;situ XANES experiments, were also conducted to probe the location of adsorption sites.

         <title>Innovative On&#8208;Resin and in Solution Peptidomimetics Synthesis via Metal&#8208;Free Photocatalytic Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work we studied an innovative peptidomimetic synthesis via metal&#8208;free photoredox approach, exploiting the reaction between dihydropyridines functionalized with amino acids (or peptide sequences) and differently functionalized imines. Furthermore, we successfully employed this methodology on solid phase peptide synthesis, obtaining peptides of different lengths and secondary structures, proving the success of this approach, even in a sterically hindered environment.







Abstract
Nowadays, peptidomimetics are widely studied, being useful tools in drug discovery and medicinal chemistry. The coupling between a carboxylic acid with an amine to form a peptide bond is the most common reaction to obtain peptides/peptidomimetics. In this work, we have investigated an innovative metal&#8208;free photoredox&#8208;catalyzed carbamoylation to form peptidomimetics thanks to the reaction between dihydropyridines functionalized with amino acids (or peptide sequences) and differently functionalized imines. As the organic photocatalyst, we used 4CzIPN, a donor&#8208;acceptor cyanoarene vastly used in photoredox catalysis. By easily modulating the amino acid (or peptide sequence), which is directly attached to the dihydropyridine, we proposed this key&#8208;reaction as new valuable method to obtain peptidomimetics, in&#8197;situ building the not&#8208;natural portion of the sequence. Moreover, we successfully employed this methodology in solid phase peptide synthesis, both inserting the new photoredox&#8208;generated amino acid at the end or in the middle of the sequence. Peptides with different lengths and secondary structures were prepared, proving the success of this approach, even in sterically hindered environment. Herein, to the best of our knowledge, we describe the first photocatalytic protocol which allows the building of the peptide backbone, with the possibility of simultaneously inserting a non&#8208;coded amino acid in the sequence.

         <title>Formal Transformation of Benzylic Carboxylic Acids to Phenols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of phenols from the benzylic carboxylic acids is described herein. The photocatalytic conversion of carboxylic acids to peroxides represents a pivotal step in this strategy, facilitating the subsequent C&#8722;O bond formation via Hock rearrangement.







Abstract
Phenols play a crucial role as core structural motifs in natural products and also serve as fundamental building blocks in synthetic chemistry. Apart from the known protocols for the conversion of aryl precursors to phenols (i.&#8201;e., decarboxylative oxygenation), we report here the efficient synthesis of phenols from the stable and readily available benzylic carboxylic acids under mild reaction conditions. The photocatalytic conversion of carboxylic acids to peroxides is a crucial step in this strategy, allowing the subsequent C&#8722;O bond formation via Hock rearrangement.

         <title>Tailoring ORR Activity in Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C Catalysts through Phosphorus Incorporation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomically dispersed iron and nitrogen co&#8208;doped carbon materials (Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C) represent promising non&#8208;precious metal catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), offering potential alternatives to noble metal&#8208;based benchmarks. In our study, we investigated the influence of phosphorus doping on the catalytic activity of Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C. The experimental research demonstrate that the doping of phosphorus significantly enhances the ORR activity. Specifically, the resulting Fe&#8208;NPC exhibits high metal loading and excellent ORR activity in 0.1 M KOH with an onset potential of 1.00 V and a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.864 V. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations reveal that phosphorus improves the electrocatalytic activity by activating O2 molecules and reducing the energy barrier (the hydrogenation reaction *OH&#8594;H2O) of the rate&#8208;determining step. Furthermore, Fe&#8208;NPC exhibits promising application prospects as an air cathode in Zn&#8208;air batteries, delivering a high maximum discharge power density of 180.3 mW cm&#8208;2 and outstanding discharge specific capacity (758.8 mAh g&#8208;1Zn) at a discharge current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Tracking Microenvironmental Response on Self&#8208;Assembled Phthalocyanine Systems &#8211; Adaptive and Non&#8208;Adaptive Antibacterial Photosensitization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 62, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study using steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved fluorescence measurements, we investigate how self&#8208;assembled photosensitizers respond to changes in molecular crowding and presence of different bacteria. We observed that certain systems exhibit adaptive behavior and alter their photoinduced activity, while others do not, highlighting the impact of confined environments and intermolecular interactions on the relaxation pathways of excited states in photoactive molecules.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly has proven to be one of the effective methods for the formation of nanoscale therapeutics without the need to use nanodelivery systems. Such minimal models of supramolecular systems formed from amphiphilic photosensitizers (PS) have recently emerged as a new class of photoactive systems, providing unique and in some cases superior activities. Although the mechanism of photogenerated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in such systems is studied and to a certain extent understood, there are very limited studies investigating the influence of intricate environmental factors, including those occurring in the cellular environment, on the self&#8208;assembly and thus the activity of the system. Understanding the optimal conditions for the formation of active PS aggregates is an important area of research in the field of photodynamic therapy (PDT), as it is directly linked to the optimal treatment dose. In this study, we describe the synthesis, self&#8208;assembly properties, photophysical characterization, and photobiological efficacy of structurally closely related low&#8208;symmetry phthalocyanine derivatives. Studying the decay behavior of the PS fluorescence lifetime in the presence of molecular crowders and different bacterial strains, we found that certain derivatives exhibited adaptive behavior and change in activity, while others demonstrated non&#8208;adaptive characteristics.

         <title>Air and Water Stable Bicyclic (Alkyl)(Amino)Carbene Stabilized Phosphenium Cation: Reactivity and Selective Fluoride Ion Affinity</title>

         <dc:description>
In this study, we present the synthesis and reactivity of the BICAAC&#8208;stabilized phosphenium cation, which is air and moisture stable and exhibits selective fluoride binding.







Abstract
The synthesis and reactivity of an air and water stable Bicyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (BICAAC) stabilized phosphenium cation (1) is reported. Air and water stable phosphenium cation are rare in the literature. Compound 1 is obtained by reaction of BICAAC with Ph2PCl in THF followed by anion exchange with LiOTf. The reduction and oxidation of 1 yielded corresponding &#945;&#8208;radical phosphine species (2) and BICAAC stabilized phosphenium oxide (3) respectively. All compounds are well characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. The Lewis acidity of compounds 1 and 3 are determined by conducting fluoride ion affinity experiments using UV&#8208;Vis spectrophotometry and multinuclei NMR spectroscopy. Compounds 1 and 3 exhibited selective binding to fluoride anion but did not interact with other halides (Cl&#8722; and Br&#8722;). Quantum chemical calculations were performed to understand the structure and nature of bonding interactions in these compounds, as well as to comprehend the specific bonding affinity to fluoride over other halide ions.

         <title>Quantitative Reactivity Models for Oxidative Addition to L2Pd(0): Additional Substrate Classes, Solvents, and Mechanistic Insights</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 62, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantitative structure&#8208;reactivity models for the oxidative addition of more than 100 (hetero)aryl (pseudo)halides to Pd(PCy3)2 reveal how the molecular structure of the substrate affects reaction rate. The models can also help identify mechanistic changes between a typical 3&#8208;centered mechanism and a polar nucleophilic displacement mechanism.







Abstract
Quantitative molecular structure&#8208;reactivity models are useful for generating predictions to guide synthesis design, and in formulating and testing mechanistic hypotheses. We report an expanded multivariate linear regression (MLR) model for the rate of (hetero)aryl (pseudo)halide oxidative addition to L2Pd(0), here exemplified by Pd(PCy3)2. This builds on a prior model from our group, with additional substrate classes (aryl chlorides and iodides) and reaction solvents (THF, toluene, THF/DMF mixture). Overall solvent effects across the entire substrate set are minimal under these conditions, enabling a unified MLR model without introduction of new molecular descriptors beyond the original five. Examining the mechanistic origin of the two molecular electrostatic potential (ESP) descriptors led to generation of a simpler, four descriptor model that is suitable for aryl halides, but not for 2&#8208;halopyridines. Using this model we identified a mechanistic outlier, 2&#8208;pyridyl triflate, which undergoes a nucleophilic displacement oxidative addition that does not involve the adjacent nitrogen atom. Finally, we discuss the relationship between C&#8722;X bond strength and oxidative addition rates, and compare the intrinsic bond strength index (IBSI) to bond dissociation enthalpy (BDE) as a bond strength descriptor.

         <title>Interrogating Explicit Solvent Effects on the Mechanism and Site&#8208;Selectivity of Aryl Halide Oxidative Addition to L2Pd(0)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 62, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvent identity influences the rate and site&#8208;selectivity of (hetero)aryl (pseudo)halide oxidative addition to Pd(PCy3)2 in several ways. Substrates with H&#8208;bond donating groups are deactivated in polar solvents with high solvent hydrogen bonding basicity, whereas electron deficient substrates and aryl triflates undergo faster oxidative addition in more polar solvents.







Abstract
We report a study of solvent effects on the rate, selectivity, and mechanism of (hetero)aryl (pseudo)halide oxidative addition to Pd(PCy3)2 as an exemplar of L2Pd(0) species. First, 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;3&#8208;aminopyridine is observed to undergo faster oxidative addition in toluene compared to more polar solvents, which is not consistent with the trend we observe with many other 2&#8208;halopyridines. We attribute this to solvent basicity hydrogen bonding between solvent and substrate. Greater hydrogen bond donation from the substrate leads to a more electron&#8208;rich aromatic system, and therefore slower oxidative addition. We demonstrate how this affects rate and site&#8208;selectivity for hydrogen bond donating substrates. Second, electron&#8208;deficient multihalogenated pyridines exhibit improved site&#8208;selectivity in polar solvents, which we attribute to different C&#8722;X sites undergoing oxidative addition by two different mechanisms. The C&#8722;X site that favours the more polar nucleophilic displacement transition state is preferred over the site that favours a less&#8208;polar 3&#8208;centered transition state. Finally, (hetero)aryl triflates consistently undergo faster oxidative addition in more polar solvents, which we attribute to highly polar nucleophilic displacement transition states. This leads to improved site&#8208;selectivity for C&#8722;OTf oxidative addition, even in the presence of highly reactive 2&#8208;pyridyl halides.

         <title>N2H4 Derived Sulfonic Acids: Hydrazine Disulfonate, [(SO3)HNNH(SO3)]2&#8722;, and Hydrazine Iso&#8208;disulfonate, [H2NN(SO3)2]2&#8722;</title>

Insertion of SO3 molecules into the N&#8722;H bonds of hydrazine, N2H4 lead to the hydrazine disulfonate [(SO3)HNNH(SO3)]2&#8722; and the hydrazine iso&#8208;disulfonate, [H2NN(SO3)2]2&#8722; anion, respectively. The salts of these new anions have been characterized comprehensively, including thermal analyses, Raman spectroscopy and DFT calculations.







Abstract
The reaction of hydrazinium sulfate and chlorosulfonic acid in pyridine leads to the pyridinium salt of the hydrazine disulfonate anion, [(SO3)HNNH(SO3)]2&#8722;. The salt is the starting material for the preparation of further hydrazine disulfonates, for example of alkaline metals and barium. In all compounds, the [(SO3)HNNH(SO3)]2&#8722; anion adopts the gauche conformation. The conformer is chiral but all of the investigated compounds crystallize as racemates. The disulfonate anion can occur in another constitution with the two sulfonate groups attached to only one nitrogen atom. This so&#8208;called hydrazine iso&#8208;disulfonate, [H2NN(SO3)2]2&#8722;, has been prepared through a substitution reaction between potassium imidodisulfonate, K2[HN(SO3)2], and hydroxylamine&#8208;O&#8208;sulfonic acid, H2NOSO3H. The hydrazine iso&#8208;disulfonate anion has been crystallized as potassium and barium compound, respectively. The compounds were characterized by XRD, vibrational spectroscopy, DFT calculations and thermal analyses.

         <title>Pd/C&#8211;Catalyzed Selective N&#8208;Monomethylation by Transfer Hydrogenation of Urea Derivatives using Methanol as H2 and C1 Sources</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 62, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly selective commercially available carbon supported palladium (Pd/C)&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;monomethylation of Urea derivatives is achieved using Methanol as both a hydrogen (H2) and methyl (C1) Source. This one&#8208;pot synthetic methodology presents an alternative route for the synthesis of mono&#8208;methylated amines from urea derivatives via transfer hydrogenation.







Abstract
N&#8208;monomethyl amines are useful intermediates in drugs, natural products, paints. Yet their synthesis is a tremendous challenge due to their high reactivity, typically leading to overmethylation. In this contribution, a highly selective catalytic N&#8208;methylation methodology is reported, converting urea derivatives to monomethylated amines, using a commercially available heterogeneous Pd/C catalyst and methanol as unique reagent. Methanol provides a sustainable alternative protocol for the selective preparation of mono&#8208;methylated derivatives as it acts as both H2 and C1 sources. In addition, several control experiments were performed to provide a proposal for the mechanism, namely dehydrogenation of methanol and subsequent hydrogenation of urea derivatives, followed by reduction of the in&#8197;situ formed methyl imine. Importantly, the approach is simple, highly productive and enables novel synthetic procedures for the preparation of monomethylamines from urea derivatives.

         <title>Gold Meets Selenium: Dual Activation of Selenium&#8208;Containing Propargyl Alcohols Towards the Synthesis of 2H&#8208;Chromenes and Mechanistic Insights</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 62, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double gold catalyzed reaction using propargylic alkynes containing selenium. With this procedure chromenes and chromenones could be accessed. Studies between the reactivity of gold and selenium were performed.The gold&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of seleno&#8208;substituted chromenes from propargyl selenoalkynes and phenols is reported. Mechanistic studies by NMR and HRMS support a dual role of the gold catalyst both as a Lewis and &#960;&#8208;acid to enable the title reaction. Key to the success of the reaction is the initial activation of the propargyl alcohol, ultimately leading to a selenium&#8208;stabilized vinyl cation.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of seleno&#8208;substituted chromenes from selenoalkynes and phenols. In this cascade reaction, the applied gold catalyst not only functions as a &#960;&#8208;acid, but also as a Lewis acid, enabling the propargylic substitution in the first step to connect the oxygen carbon bond. Under the optimal reaction condition a total of 26 chromenes were accessible by this modular access. During scale up experiments, the hydrolysis of the vinylselenium substructure to the corresponding chromenones was observed. By revisiting the electron&#8208;rich starting materials, four chromenones were produced following a one&#8208;pot reaction using a single gold catalyst. To better understand the interaction of gold and selenium, a series of nuclear magnetic resonance studies and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry studies were performed, which led to the proposal of a mechanism for this transformation.

         <title>Platinum(II)&#8208;Salphen Complexes as DNA Binders and Photosensitisers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 62, November 7, 2024. </description>

Light&#8208;activated cytotoxic agents are attractive compounds as potential anticancer drugs. A library of 21 platinum(II) complexes is presented together with a systematic study of their DNA binding affinities, photophysical and photochemical properties, cellular imaging and phototoxicity. A lead compound has been identified which is not toxic in the dark against cancer cells, but toxic at nanomolar concentrations upon irradiation.







Abstract
Current anticancer therapies suffer from issues such as off&#8208;target side effects and the emergence of drug resistance; therefore, the discovery of alternative therapeutic approaches is vital. These can include the development of drugs with different modes of action, and the exploration of new biomolecular targets. For the former, there has been increasing interest in drugs that are activated by an external stimulus (e.&#8201;g. light irradiation) to generate cytotoxic chemicals such as reactive oxygen species (ROS). For the latter, significant efforts are being directed to explore non&#8208;canonical DNA and RNA structures (e.&#8201;g. guanine&#8208;quadruplexes), as alternative biomolecular targets. Herein we report the synthesis of a library of 21 new platinum(II)&#8208;Salphen complexes (square planar platinum(II) complexes coordinated to tetradentate O,N,N,O&#8208;Schiff base ligands), and the investigation, for all complexes, of their photophysical and photochemical properties, their interactions with duplex and quadruplex DNA, and their cytotoxicity against HeLa cancer cells both in the dark and upon light irradiation. Thanks to the intrinsic phosphorescence of the platinum(II) complexes, confocal microscopy was used for six of the complexes to determine their cellular permeability and localisation in two cancer cell lines (HeLa and U2OS). Altogether, these studies have allowed us to identify two lead platinum(II) complexes with high guanine&#8208;quadruplex DNA affinity and selectivity, good cell permeability and nuclear localisation, and high cytotoxicity against HeLa cancer cells upon irradiation with no detected cytotoxicity in the dark.

         <title>Deuteration Degree Controllable Synthesis of Aryl Deuteromethyl Ethers Through Dual photoredox and Thiol Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 62, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aryl d1, d2, and d3 methyl ethers are precisely prepared through dual photoredox and thiol catalysis, utilizing inexpensive D2O and CDCl3 as deuterium sources. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, without requiring high temperature or high loading of transition metal catalysts, allowing for a wide range of functional groups to be well tolerated.







Abstract
Herein, we report a facile and efficient deuteration degree controllable method for the preparation of aryl deuteromethyl ethers through dual photoredox and thiol catalysis using phenols as the starting materials and inexpensive D2O and CDCl3 as the deuterium sources. All aryl d1, d2, and d3 deuteromethyl ethers can be precisely prepared with good to excellent yields and deuteration ratios. The reaction operates under mild conditions without the need for high temperatures or high loading of transition metal catalysts, and a wide range of functional groups are well tolerated.

         <title>Enhanced Photodynamic Therapy for Neurodegenerative Diseases: Development of Azobenzene&#8208;Spiropyran@Gold Nanoparticles for Controlled Singlet Oxygen Generation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 62, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A groundbreaking nano&#8208;photosensitizer: a core&#8208;shell merocyanine&#8208;azobenzene on gold nanoparticles. This cutting&#8208;edge technology demonstrates remarkable efficacy in generating singlet oxygen. With its long&#8208;lasting stability and enhanced biocompatibility, it holds immense potential for advancing phototherapy in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.







Abstract
The development of durable photosensitizers is pivotal for advancing phototherapeutic applications in biomedicine. Here, we introduce a core&#8208;shell azobenzene&#8208;spiropyran structure on gold nanoparticles, engineered to enhance singlet oxygen generation. These nano&#8208;photosensitizers exhibit increased structural stability and thermal resistance, as demonstrated by slowed O&#8722;N&#8722;C bond recombination dynamics via in&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy. Notably, the in&#8208;situ formation of merocyanine and a light&#8208;induced compact shell arrangement extend its half&#8208;life from 47&#8197;minutes to over 154&#8197;hours, significantly boosting singlet oxygen output. The nano&#8208;photosensitizer also shows high biocompatibility and notably inhibits tau protein aggregation in neural cells, even with phosphatase inhibitors. Further, it promotes dendritic growth in neuro cells, doubling typical lengths. This work not only advances chemical nanotechnology but also sets a foundation for developing long&#8208;lasting phototherapy agents for treating neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>Janus Reactivity of Crownphyrinoids: Alkali&#8208; vs. Transition Metal&#8208;Mediated Transformations of Crown Ether&#8208;Porphyrin Hybrids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 62, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual&#8208;nature cavities of crownphyrinoids enable reactivity at distinct porphyrinoid&#8208; or crown ether part of the macrocyclic ligand. Depending on the metal and oxidation level of the macrocycle, they bind cations, yielding monomeric, dimeric, or accordion&#8208;like complexes. The use of a crownphyrin capable of incorporating two metal centres allowed for obtaining heterobinuclear complexes wherein the macrocycle demonstrated the Janus reactivity.







Abstract
Crownphyrinogens and crownphyrins constitute a group of macrocycles that combine the structural facets of porphyrinoids and crown ethers. The dual&#8208;nature cavity embedded in their molecules enables reactivity involving two structurally distinct parts of the macrocyclic ligand. Upon Ni(II) and Pd(II) insertion, coordination compounds are produced wherein the metal is incorporated into the porphyrinoid&#8208;like pocket, resulting in monomeric or accordion&#8208;like dimeric products, depending on the oxidation level of the macrocycle and metal cation. The reactions with Na(I) and K(I) resulted in the formation of complexes where only the crown ether segment of the molecule is involved in metal binding, yielding remarkable dimeric species. The exploitation of a crownphyrin large enough to accommodate two metal cations allowed the synthesis of an alkali/transition metal binuclear complexes wherein the macrocycle demonstrated the Janus reactivity with one cavity acting as a porphyrinoid and the other mimicking the crown ether.

We report on the development of novel dual light&#8208;responsive and redox&#8208;active foldamers that demonstrate multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive behaviour of the supramolecular scaffold and display low levels of operational fatigue upon cyclic treatments with light and oxidative/reductive conditions.







Abstract
We report on dual, light&#8208;responsive and redox&#8208;active foldamers that demonstrate reversible and robust stimuli&#8208;induced behaviour. Herein, UV/Vis, 1H NMR and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry have been used to establish the reversibility and highly robust nature of the light&#8208; and redox&#8208;driven behaviour of these new foldamers with minimal levels of fatigue observed even upon multiple cyclic treatments with irradiative/non&#8208;irradiative and oxidative/reductive conditions. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept work paves the way towards the creation of novel stimuli&#8208;responsive foldamers of increasing sophistication capable of demonstrating reversible and robust responses to multiple distinct stimuli.

Many porphyrinoid&#8208;based photosensitizers experience aggregation&#8208;induced quenching, reducing their activity. However, in some cases, their photodynamic activity is restored after incubation with cells. To better understand these changes, we examined how self&#8208;assembled phthalocyanine derivatives behave in biological media. By analyzing fluorescence lifetime decay in the presence of molecular crowders and bacterial strains, we found that some derivatives exhibited adaptive activity changes, while others remained unchanged. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Galstyan (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202401305).

         <title>Bioinspired Molecular Scalpel for Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8208;Organic Nanosheet: Design Strategies and Recent Progress</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 62, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired molecular scalpel strategies provide powerful approach to create two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8208;organic nanosheets (MONs). These strategies can be grouped into two categories: top&#8208;down exfoliation and bottom&#8208;up assembly. This review discusses their latest development from various perspectives, including composition, structure, morphology, property, potential application and practical challenge.







Abstract
Ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8208;organic nanosheets (MONs) have attracted continued attention in the field of advanced functional materials. Their nanoscale thickness, high surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio, and abundant accessible active sites, are superior advantages compared with their 3D bulk counterparts. Bioinspired molecular scalpel strategy is a promising method for the creation of 2D MONs, and may solve the current shortcomings of MONs synthesis. This review aims to provide a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art overview of molecular scalpel strategies and share the results of current development to provide a better solution for MONs synthesis. Different types of molecular scalpel strategies have been systematically summarized. Both mechanisms, advantages and limitations of multiform molecular scalpel strategies have been discussed. Besides, the challenges to be overcome and the question to be solved are also introduced.

         <title>Photo&#8208;/Electrocatalytic Difunctionalization of Alkenes Enabled by C&#8722;H Radical Functionalization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 62, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in photo&#8208;/electocatalyzed alkene difunctionalization enabled by C&#8722;H radical functionalization are summarized, which are divided to four sections based on the final terminating step, including oxidative radical&#8208;polar crossover coupling, reductive radical&#8208;polar crossover coupling, radical&#8208;radical coupling and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed coupling, along with selected impressive synthetic examples to showcase the importance of the C&#8722;H radical functionalization&#8208;enabled alkene difunctionalization in synthesis.







Abstract
The difunctionalization of alkenes represents a powerful tool to incorporate two functional groups into the alkene bones for increasing molecular complexity and has been widely utilizations in chemical synthesis. Upon the catalysis of the green, sustainable, mild photo&#8208;/electrochemistry technologies, much attentions have been attracted to the development of new tactics for the transformations of the important alkene and alkane feedstocks driven by C&#8722;H radical functionalization. Herein, we summarize recent advances in the photo&#8208;/electrocatalytic difunctionalization of alkenes enabled by C&#8722;H radical functionalization.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difunctionalization of alkenes represents a powerful tool to incorporate two functional groups into the alkene bones for increasing molecular complexity and has been widely utilizations in chemical synthesis. Upon the catalysis of the green, sustainable, mild photo-/electrochemistry technologies, much attentions have been attracted to the development of new tactics for the transformations of the important alkene and alkane feedstocks driven by C&#8722;H radical functionalization. Herein, we summarize recent advances in the photo-/electrocatalytic difunctionalization of alkenes enabled by C&#8722;H radical functionalization. We detailedly discuss the substrate scope and the mechanisms of the photo-/electrocatalytic alkene difunctionalization reactions by selecting impressive synthetic examples, which are divided into four sections based on the final terminated step, including oxidative radical-polar crossover coupling, reductive radical-polar crossover coupling, radical-radical coupling, and transition-metal-catalyzed coupling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Harnessing Gene Editing Technology for Tumor Microenvironment Modulation: An Emerging Anticancer Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 62, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emergence of gene editing technologies, particularly the CRISPR&#8208;Cas system, offers promising new strategies for the cancer treatment. Benefiting from nanomaterial strategies, the limitations of CRISPR&#8208;Cas system for in&#8197;vivo application are dramatically improved and can effectively regulate the tumor microenvironment, which provides a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art avenue for tumor therapy.







Abstract
Cancer is a multifaceted disease influenced by both intrinsic cellular traits and extrinsic factors, with the tumor microenvironment (TME) being crucial for cancer progression. To satisfy their high proliferation and aggressiveness, cancer cells always plunder large amounts of nutrients and release various signals to their surroundings, forming a dynamic TME with special metabolic, immune, microbial and physical characteristics. Due to the neglect of interactions between tumor cells and the TME, traditional cancer therapies often struggle with challenges such as drug resistance, low efficacy, and recurrence. Importantly, the development of gene editing technologies, particularly the CRISPR&#8208;Cas system, offers promising new strategies for cancer treatment. Combined with nanomaterial strategies, CRISPR&#8208;Cas technology exhibits precision, affordability, and user&#8208;friendliness with reduced side effects, which holds great promise for profoundly altering the TME at the genetic level, potentially leading to lasting anticancer outcomes. This review will delve into how CRISPR&#8208;Cas can be leveraged to manipulate the TME, examining its potential as a transformative anticancer therapy.

         <title>Frustrated Radical Pairs: From Fleeting Intermediates to Isolable Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present the design and comprehensive investigation of stable para&#8208;substituted triarylamine&#8211;2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ) radical ion pairs (RIPs) generated via single&#8208;electron transfer (SET). We quantified the degree of SET in both solution and solid phases, utilising a suite of spectroscopic techniques including IR, EPR, NMR, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8211;XRD). Our findings reveal that the extent of SET is significantly influenced by the nature of the substituents (MeO &gt; tBu &gt; Br) and the polarity of the solvent (MeCN &gt; DCM &gt; toluene). The radical ion pair [(pMeOPh)3N]&#8226;+[DDQ]&#8226;&#8211; was unambiguously identified using EPR and UV&#8211;vis spectroscopy, and its structure was confirmed by SC&#8211;XRD. Detailed analysis indicates an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state with a thermally accessible triplet state, as corroborated by EPR, magnetic susceptibility measurements, and DFT calculations. This study offers crucial insights into the mechanistic pathways of RIP formation and tuning both in solution and solid states, laying the groundwork for future exploration of their reactivity and potential applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Ortho Arylation of N&#8208;Aryl Amides and the Construction of Diagonal Tetraarylbenzenediamines and N&#8208;Doped Fulminenes via BBr3&#8208;Derived Dibromoboracycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of biaryl amides, which are prevalent motifs in bioactive molecules, often necessitates lengthy and inefficient procedures. To address these limitations, catalytic C&#8208;H activation protocols have emerged, enabling the direct ortho&#8208;arylation of aryl amides. However, these protocols often suffer from issues such as lack of selectivity, reliance on stoichiometric oxidants, and the requirement for excess reagents and harsh reaction conditions. To overcome these challenges, we present a novel and highly selective protocol for the ortho&#8208;arylation of N&#8208;aryl amides and ureas. The high selectivity originates from the directed installation of BBr3 to form a boracycle, which then undergoes cross&#8208;coupling with an aryl halide. Our method offers significant advantages, including mild reaction conditions, excellent site&#8208;specificity, and scalability. The protocol demonstrates broad compatibility with a diverse range of readily accessible functionalized anilides and aryl iodides, as evidenced by 55 successful examples yielding products in the 30&#8211;95% range. Furthermore, our methodology surpasses conventional approaches by facilitating the one&#8208;pot selective diagonal diarylation of dianilides. This capability unlocks the construction of previously unattainable diagonal aryl systems, which serve as valuable precursors for the synthesis of diagonal tetraarylbenzenediamines and N&#8208;doped fulminene, two crucial compound classes in materials science.</dc:description>

         <title>Distinguishing Organomagnesium Species in the Grignard Addition to Ketones with X&#8208;Ray Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have calculated the X&#8208;ray absorption and photoelectron spectroscopy of organomagnesium species in solution in the reaction of CH3MgCl with acetone. The spectra provide insight into the oxidation state of magnesium and the changes in the first solvation sphere.







Abstract
The addition of Grignard reagents to ketones is a well&#8208;established textbook reaction. However, a comprehensive understanding of its mechanism has only recently begun to emerge. X&#8208;ray spectroscopy, because of its high selectivity and sensitivity, is the ideal tool for distinguishing between an ensemble of competing pathways. With this aim in mind, we investigated the concerted mechanism of the addition of methylmagnesium chloride (CH3MgCl) to acetone in tetrahydrofuran by simulating the X&#8208;ray spectra of different molecules in solution. We used electronic structure methods to calculate the X&#8208;ray absorption spectra at the Mg K&#8208; and L1&#8208;edges and the X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectra at the Mg K&#8208;edge for different organomagnesium species, which coexist in solution due to the Schlenk equilibrium. The simulated spectra show that individual species can be distinguished throughout the different stages of the reaction. Each species has a distinct spectral feature which can be used as a fingerprint in solution. The absorption and photoelectron spectra consistently show a blue shift as the reaction progressed from reagents to products.

         <title>Investigating the Effect of UV Irradiation and TiO2 Addition on Heavy Metal Adsorption by Inverse Vulcanized Sulfur Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of light exposure on the process of mercury adsorption was explored in this study. Our findings reveal that exposure to UV&#8722;A wavelengths (315&#8197;nm&#8211;400&#8197;nm), in combination with the addition of titanium dioxide (TiO2), enhances the adsorption capacity of a sulfur&#8208;rich polymer. The maximum observed adsorption capacity reached 47&#8197;mg/g under these conditions. Notably, the presence of TiO2 and UV exposure did not significantly impact the adsorption of inorganic mercury and gold.







Abstract
Organomercury contamination in wastewater is a longstanding global concern, prompting the establishment of the Mi&#8208;namata Convention in 2013, following the tragic Minamata Bay incident in Japan. Despite numerous proposed solutions, the development of an affordable and convenient adsorbent remains a challenge. Sulfur, being one of the most abundant elements globally, has shown promise in mercury adsorption in previous research. This study delves into the influence of light exposure on the process of mercury adsorption. Our findings reveal that exposure to UV&#8722;A wavelengths (315&#8197;nm&#8211;400&#8197;nm), in combination with the addition of titanium dioxide (TiO2), enhances the adsorption capacity of a sulfur&#8208;rich polymer.

Notably, the presence of TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and UV exposure did not significantly impact the adsorption of inorganic mercury and gold.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Identification of Peptide Binding Motifs for Calcium Sulfate Hemihydrate using Phage Display</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydration of bassanite (calcium sulfate hemihydrate) into gypsum (the dihydrate) is a fundamental reaction underlying the working principle of conventional plasters. To achieve selective control over this process, peptide structures showing strong interactions with the mineral surfaces were rationally identified by means of phage display. The results highlight the potential of this biophysical technique in the design of new crystallization additives for sustainable construction solutions.







Abstract
Selective control over crystallization in complex multicomponent systems such as hydrating cements is a key issue in modern material science. In this context, rational selection&#8208;based approaches appear highly promising in the quest for new additive chemistries. Here we have used phage display to identify peptide structures showing high affinity to adsorb on the surfaces of calcium sulfate hemihydrate (also referred to as bassanite), an important hydraulic binder employed in large scales by the construction industry. The results suggest a triplet of amino acids consisting of aspartic acid, serine and leucine, to maintain strong interactions with the surfaces of hemihydrate particles. This notion is confirmed by actual hydration experiments, in which the identified peptide motif provides strictly selective effects during the transformation of bassanite into more stable gypsum. Our work thus contributes to a better understanding of hydraulic binders and their required improvement for a sustainable future.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal Free Amination and Hydrodefluorination of Aryl Fluorides Promoted by Solvated Electrons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a transition metal&#8208;free method for C&#8722;N coupling of aryl fluorides using solvated electrons, red light, and sonication. The method exhibits moderate&#8208;to&#8208;high yields (35&#8211;99&#8201;%), broad substrate compatibility, and eliminates toxic catalysts.







Abstract
Cross&#8208;coupling reactions for constructing C&#8722;N bonds represent a pivotal advancement in chemical science. Traditional methodologies, including nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) and transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;couplings, have limitations concerning aryl scope, reliance on toxic and costly transition&#8208;metal catalysts, and issues related to atom economy and waste generation from ligands and additives. In this work, we introduce a novel method for aminating neutral, electron&#8208;rich, and electron&#8208;deficient aryl halides, eliminating the need for transition metals. Our approach involves the activation of aryl halides using solvated electrons generated from granulated lithium and sonication. This serves as a sustainable source of reducing power, facilitating the efficient formation of C&#8722;N bonds under near ambient conditions. Competitive selectivity studies between halide and ester functionalities were explored. Reaction scope and conducted mechanistic studies which supported the proposed radical&#8208;nucleophilic substitution (SRN1) mechanism for the reaction. Notably, the developed reaction has a highly competitive reductive dehalogenation pathway during the C&#8722;N coupling reaction, and this mechanistic divergency was thoroughly explored. This work not only broadens the scope of C&#8722;N coupling reactions which typically employs aryl bromides and iodides and rarely aryl fluorides which is also equally abundant, but also introduces a new way to do C&#8722;N coupling reactions using solvated electrons.

         <title>Preparation, Structure, Reactivity, Lewis Acidic and Fluorescence Properties of Arylpyridine Based Boron C,N&#8208;Chelates Featuring Weakly Coordinating Anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydride elimination from arylpyridyl&#8208;boranes results in formation of cationic highly Lewis acidic species. Nature of counterion appears to be crucial for its reactivity but also to its photophysical behavior. By taking advantage of accessibility diverse aryl pyridines and also by hydroboration reactivity of product, we prepared highly emissive compounds exhibiting green&#8208;yellow fluorescence with reaching quantum yields up to 93&#8201;% have been reported.







Abstract
Herein, we present the preparation of a series of electronically and/or sterically distinct borenium&#8208;type species based on a simple 2&#8208;arylpyridine scaffold. Corresponding arylpyridine was firstly subjected to electrophilic borylation (BBr3/i&#8208;Pr2NEt) and formed BBr2 chelate was reduced with LiAlH4 to yield arylpyridine boron dihydride. Elimination of one hydride led to Lewis acidic borenium&#8208;like products. Four methods of hydride elimination were evaluated and influence of counterions on reactivity, Lewis acidic and luminescent properties was assessed both experimentally and computationally. Arylpyridine chelates featuring weakly coordinating counterions exhibit fluorescent properties upon UV irradiation. Several general trends were inferred to modulate emission wavelength and fluorescence quantum yield. Based on our observations, we have devised and prepared borenium&#8208;type fluorophores with yellow&#8208;green fluorescence and quantum yields up to 93&#8201;%.

         <title>Platinum&#8208;Centered Oligoynes Capped by Boron Difluoride Formazanate Dyes and Their Thin&#8208;Film Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly stable Pt(II)&#8208;centered oligoynes capped by boron difluoride formazanate dyes exhibit solution processability, redox activity, panchromatic absorption, and thin film conductivity. Compared to their metal&#8208;free analogs, Pt(II)&#8208;centered oligoynes have poorer conductivity on the microscale and improved conductivity on the nanoscale.







Abstract
Since the Nobel prize winning discovery that polyacetylene could act as a semiconductor, there has been tremendous efforts dedicated to understanding and harnessing the unusual properties of &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers. Much of this research has focused on the preparation of oligoynes and polyynes with well&#8208;defined numbers of repeating alkyne units as models for carbyne. These studies are usually hampered by a structure&#8208;property relationship where the stability of the resulting materials decrease with the incorporation of additional alkyne units. Here, we describe a series of oligoynes, with up to 12 alkyne units, where electron&#8208;rich [Pt(PBu3)2]2+ units are incorporated at the center of the oligoyne backbones which are capped by electron&#8208;poor BF2 formazanate dyes. These compounds exhibit excellent stability and solubility, panchromatic absorption, and redox activity characteristic of their structural components. These traits facilitated thin&#8208;film studies of extended oligoyne materials, where it is shown that incorporating [Pt(PBu3)2]2+ units leads to smoother films, decreased conductivity on the microscale, and increased conductivity on the nanoscale when compared to metal&#8208;free analogs. Remarkably, our oligoynes have superior conductivity compared to the ubiquitous poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) semiconductor.

         <title>Odorant Binding Proteins Facilitate the Gas&#8208;Phase Uptake of Odorants Through the Nasal Mucus</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mammalian odorant binding proteins (OBPs) have long been suggested to transport hydrophobic odorant molecules through the aqueous environment of the nasal mucus. While the function of OBPs as odorant transporters is supported by their hydrophobic beta&#8208;barrel structure, no rationale has been provided on why and how these proteins facilitate the uptake of odorants from the gas phase. Here, a multi&#8208;scale computational approach validated through available high&#8208;resolution spectroscopy experiments reveals that the conformational space explored by carvone inside the binding cavity of porcine OBP (pOBP) is much closer to the gas than the aqueous phase, and that pOBP effectively manages to transport odorants by lowering the free energy barrier of odorant uptake. Understanding such perireceptor events is crucial to fully unravel the molecular processes underlying the olfactory sense&#160;and move towards the development of protein&#8208;based biomimetic sensor units that can serve as artificial noses.</dc:description>

         <title>A Rare Case of Magnesium Alkyl Mediated CO&#8208;to&#8208;Alkoxide Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alcohols can be produced by nucleophilic addition at the C=O functional group of ketones or aldehydes. Such C&#8208;C bond formations generally proceed smoothly and selective. In contrast, nucleophilic addition at carbon monoxide is considerably more complex and unselective due to the instability of polar metal acyl intermediates. Herein, we report a magnesium alkyl complex, stabilized with a dipyrromethenide ligand, and its reactivity with CO2 and CO. Whilst the reaction with CO2 gave the expected carboxylate, reaction with CO took a surprising course, resulting in an alkoxide by formation of three new C&#8211;C bonds in a single reaction. An intertwined experimental and computational approach sheds light on the unusual reactivity of a carbene intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechano&#8208;responsive fluorescent gel based on tetraphenylethylene&#8208;crosslinked dynamic covalent network</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rapid development of mechano&#8208;responsive fluorescence has been driven by its promising applications in the fields of sensors, information encryption, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. However, designing mechanophores that can exhibit fluorescence changes under relatively low force remains challenging. In this study, a mechano&#8208;responsive fluorescent gel was developed using a tetraphenylethylene derivative as a cross&#8208;linker, producing a dynamic covalent network that exhibits increased fluorescence under tensile stress. Based on controlled experimental studies and molecular modeling calculations, the fluorescence enhancement by external forces was attributed to the restriction of intramolecular motion in tetraphenylethylene by macromolecular chain orientation. In time&#8208;dependent experiments, due to the exchange of dynamic covalent bonds, the stress relaxation and the decrease in fluorescence intensity of the gel at fixed strain occurred simultaneously, demonstrating the potential of this fluorescence as an indication of internal stress through aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) type mechanophore.</dc:description>

         <title>Distance&#8208;dependent symmetry&#8208;breaking charge transfer in 9,10&#8208;bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene dimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To investigate the effect of the through&#8208;bond coupling strength on the symmetry&#8208;breaking charge separation (SB&#8208;CS) dynamics and mechanism, three 9,10&#8208;bis((4&#8208;hexylphenyl)ethynyl)anthracene dimers with varying distances, viz., a single&#8208;bond linked dimer (0&#8208;dimer), a phenylene linked dimer (1&#8208;dimer) and a para&#8208;biphenylene linked dimer (2&#8208;dimer), were synthesized and studied systematically using steady&#8208;state and transient spectroscopy. Steady&#8208;state absorption spectra revealed that the electronic coupling strength decreased gradually with the increase of the inter&#8208;chromophore distance, and the transition of S0&#8594;S1 includes the dark charge transfer (CT) excitation. fs&#8208;TA spectra demonstrated that SB&#8208;CS could be conducted in both weakly and highly polar solvents for 0&#8208;dimer, but the SB&#8208;CS dynamics has a significant difference. In weakly polar solvents, SB&#8208;CS only produces the partial CT (PCT) state, but it could generate the CT state via the PCT state in highly polar solvent. In comparison, SB&#8208;CS is only proceeded in highly polar solvents in 1&#8208;dimer and 2&#8208;dimer to produce the CT state directly. These results demonstrate that the SB&#8208;CS dynamics is strongly dependent on the inter&#8208;chromophore electronic coupling, and the relatively strong electronic coupling is crucial for the occurrence of SB&#8208;CS in weakly polar environment that is commonly presented in photoelectric devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Seeing double: the persistent dimer&#8208;of&#8208;dimers structure of drug resistant influenza A M2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The currently circulating S31N variant of the M2 proton channel of influenza A is resistant to antiviral drugs. Recently, there has been a growing concern regarding the impact of the lipid environment on the structural features of the S31N variant. The native symmetry of the M2 tetramer remains controversial. Here we show that S31N M2 persists in a dimer&#8208;of&#8208;dimers structure in different lipid preparations independent of the amount of solvating lipids up to at least 180 lipids per tetramer. NMR spectra clearly detect the characteristic resonances of the dimer&#8208;of&#8208;dimers of M2 (residues 18&#8208;60 or 18&#8208;62) reconstituted in lipids. NMR&#8208;based distance measurements indicate that two isoleucine residues with upfield shifted alpha carbon resonances, typical of extended conformations, are compatible with a particular side&#8208;chain rotameric state and helical backbone geometry. These chemical shifts are therefore compatible with the expected native transmembrane helical fold. Symmetry breaking at the pH sensing H37 residues, detected via peak doubling, is a stable feature of S31N M2 based on the reference strain Udorn/1972(H3N2). By contrast, the spectrum is dramatically altered for Columbia/2014/(H3N2) M2, which differs in sequence in the amphipathic helices. This highlights an allosteric coupling between the amphipathic helices and the pH sensing residues.</dc:description>

         <title>Open Sn Framework Structure Hosting Bi Guest atoms &#8211; Synthesis, Crystal and Electronic Structure of Na13Sn26Bi</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although several Na&#8208;Sn&#8208;Pnictides with a variety of structural motives are known, no ternary compound in the Na&#8208;Sn&#8208;Bi system has been described yet. In this paper we present the Zintl&#8208;phase Na13Sn25.73Bi1.27 comprising a complex, open&#8208;framework structure of Sn atoms, with one mixed Sn/Bi site, hosting Na atoms. An additional Bi atom is loosely connected with only weak contacts to the framework filling a larger cavity within the network. According to band structure calculations of the two ordered variants with either full occupation of the mixed site with Sn or Bi, resulting in Na13Sn26Bi and Na13Sn24Bi3, respectively, both compounds are semiconductors with band gaps of 0.5 eV. A comparison of the band structures with the related binary compounds Na5Sn13 and Na7Sn12 shows that only the perfectly charge balanced Na7Sn12 is a semiconductor whereas Na5Sn13 is metallic. The rather specific electronic situation in the ternary compound is traced back to the loosely bound Bi atom, which acts as a guest atom according to Bix@Na13Sn27&#8208;x&#8208;yBiy, with x=1 and y=0.27, capable to change its oxidation state and thus to uptake additional electrons to form a semiconductor.&#160;Na13Sn25.73Bi1.27 is a rare example of an open framework structure of Sn atoms comprising Bi atoms in the cavities.</dc:description>

An additional Bi atom is loosely connected with only weak contacts to the framework filling a larger cavity within the network. According to band structure calculations of the two ordered variants with either full occupation of the mixed site with Sn or Bi, resulting in Na13Sn26Bi and Na13Sn24Bi3, respectively, both compounds are semiconductors with band gaps of 0.5 eV. A comparison of the band structures with the related binary compounds Na5Sn13 and Na7Sn12 shows that only the perfectly charge balanced Na7Sn12 is a semiconductor whereas Na5Sn13 is metallic. The rather specific electronic situation in the ternary compound is traced back to the loosely bound Bi atom, which acts as a guest atom according to Bix@Na13Sn27-x-yBiy, with x=1 and y=0.27, capable to change its oxidation state and thus to uptake additional electrons to form a semiconductor.&#160;Na13Sn25.73Bi1.27 is a rare example of an open framework structure of Sn atoms comprising Bi atoms in the cavities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Iodide Double Perovskites and the Limits of their Structural Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While halide double perovskites A2M(I)M(III)X6 have attracted significant attention, examples involving iodides are rare. We examine the limits of the structural stability of iodide double perovskites, presenting the synthesis and single&#8208;crystal structures of Cs2NaScI6 and Cs2NaYI6. Bypassing the common expectation that iodides have small band gaps, these compounds display optical gaps of 3.10 eV [M(III) = Sc] and 3.65 eV [M(III) = Y]. Cs2NaScI6 is the only iodide double perovskite to exhibit a cubic crystal structure at room temperature. Density functional theory&#8208;based electronic structure calculations help understand the role of competing Cs3M(III)2I9 (3:2:9) phases and provide possible reasons for why iodide double perovskites based around In(III), Sb(III) and Bi(III) cations have proved elusive. We confirm design rules for halide double perovskite based around concepts of the tolerance factor and the radius ratio of the smaller, trivalent ion, but also point to situations such as what is observed for Cs2NaScI6 where a double perovskite can be trapped in a metastable structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Neo&#8208;Glycolipid Oximes as Intestinal Permeation Enhancers for Peptide Hormone PYY3&#8208;36</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe the design and synthesis of 16 neo&#8208;glycolipids that are potential permeation enhancers for oral drug delivery of peptide therapeutics. These amphiphilic neo&#8208;glycolipids are composed of fatty acids and various carbohydrates (D&#8208;glucose, lactose, cellobiose, maltose) via an oxime linker. The ability of the synthesized neo&#8208;glycolipids to enhance permeation of fluorescein&#8208;labelled dextran (4 kDa) or 3H&#8208;mannitol across intestinal epithelium was investigated in vitro using monolayers of human epithelial Caco&#8208;2 cells. Their effects were compared with (pre&#8208;)clinically known enhancers as reference compounds; sodium salts of octanoic, decanoic, and dodecanoic acid, and sodium salcaprozate (SNAC). Most neo&#8208;glycolipids increased the permeation of the model compounds, proving that neo&#8208;glycolipids, which possess vastly different properties from the reference compounds, e.g., in terms of clogD and polar surface area, are effective permeation enhancers. The neo&#8208;glycolipid based on decanoic acid and glucose was more potent than related compounds based on disaccharides. Significant differences in solubility and cellular compatibility were found for neo&#8208;glyolipids based on different carbohydrates. Finally, neo&#8208;glycolipids were evaluated as permeation enhancers for the peptide hormone PYY3&#8208;36. Glucose&#8208; and maltose&#8208;derived neo&#8208;glycolipids based on decanoic and dodecanoic acid showed promising enhancements in PYY3&#8208;36 permeation while maintaining good cellular compatibility, relevant for oral delivery of obesity treatments.</dc:description>

         <title>Sonodynamic Cancer Therapy by Mn(I)&#8208;tricarbonyl complexes via Ultrasound&#8208;triggered CO release and ROS generation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel ferrocene conjugated Mn(I)&#8208;tricarbonyl complex viz [Mn(Fc&#8208;tpy)(CO)3Br] (Mn2) where, Fc&#8208;tpy = 4'&#8208;ferrocenyl&#8208;2,2':6',2''&#8208;terpyridine was synthesized and fully characterized along with its non&#8208;ferrocene analog [Mn(Ph&#8208;tpy)(CO)3 Br] Ph&#8208;tpy = 4'&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2,2':6',2''&#8208;terpyridine (Mn1) for ultrasound (US) activated anticancer applications. The X&#8208;ray structure of Mn2 confirmed its distorted octahedral geometry. Mn1 and Mn2, for the first time, showed US&#8208;triggered release of CO and ROS generation (1O2 and &#8226;OH) in an aqueous solution from any Mn(I)&#8208;tricarbonyl complexes, indicating its potential for synergetic CO gas therapy and sonodynamic therapy. The above&#8208;mentioned in&#8208;solution chemistry was successfully translated into in vitro cellular models. These complexes showed unprecedented US&#8208;triggered toxicity against T&#8208;cell lymphoma and human breast cancer cells (IC50 for Mn2 &lt; 1 &#956;M) while were minimally toxic without US or against normal spleen cells. Mn2 was ca. 12 fold more anticancer active than Mn1, indicating that the ferrocene conjugation augmented the US sensitivity. The apoptotic sonotoxicity of Mn2 was due to US&#8208;promoted mitochondrial depolarization via ROS generation and CO release. The apoptosis was triggered by caspase 3 activation. This is the first report of Mn(I)&#8208;tricarbonyl&#8208;based sonosensitizers for cancer SDT. Overall, this study, for the first time, establishes the effectiveness of 3d metal carbonyls in SDT.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>X&#8208;ray scintillators, materials that convert high&#8208;energy radiation into detectable light in the ultraviolet to visible spectrum, are widely used in industrial and medical applications. Organic and organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid systems have emerged as promising alternatives for X&#8208;ray detection and imaging due to their mechanical flexibility, lightweight, tunable excited states, and solution processability for large&#8208;scale fabrication. However, these systems often suffer from weak X&#8208;ray absorption and insufficient exciton utilization, which seriously affects their scintillation performance, limiting their potential for broader application and commercialization. This review highlights recent advances in molecular engineering for developing high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray scintillators. It&#160;focuses on molecular design principles, such as the heavy atom effect, donor&#8208;acceptor/host&#8208;guest strategies, hydrogen/halogen bonding, molecular sensitization, and crystal packing, for enhancing scintillation performance. By leveraging these approaches, researchers have made significant strides in improving X&#8208;ray scintillation efficiency and advancing the potential of these materials for commercial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in NIR&#8208;Switchable Multi&#8208;Redox Systems Based on Organic Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes, exhibiting absorption in the NIR region (750&#8208;2500 nm), have been applied to various optical applications such as security marking, photovoltaic cells and chemotherapy of deep tissues in vivo. Electrochromic systems capable of switching NIR absorption are attractive from the viewpoint of applications for material and life science, and thus several examples have been reported to date. The development of organic&#8208;based materials is needed to reduce the environmental impact and improve biocompatibility, however, the switching of NIR absorption based on redox interconversion is still a challenging issue regarding reversibility and durability during interconversion. To overcome this potential instability, several studies on organic electrochromic systems that allow ON/OFF switching of NIR absorption have been developed in recent years. In this review, we focus on redox&#8208;active well&#8208;defined small molecules that enable ON/OFF switching of NIR absorption, and present recent studies on their intrinsic electrochemical and spectroscopic properties and/or structural characterization of their charged states. We also address more sophisticated electrochromic systems that can modulate their properties in response to external stimuli such as light, heat, and electric potential.</dc:description>

To overcome this potential instability, several studies on organic electrochromic systems that allow ON/OFF switching of NIR absorption have been developed in recent years. In this review, we focus on redox-active well-defined small molecules that enable ON/OFF switching of NIR absorption, and present recent studies on their intrinsic electrochemical and spectroscopic properties and/or structural characterization of their charged states. We also address more sophisticated electrochromic systems that can modulate their properties in response to external stimuli such as light, heat, and electric potential.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Construction and Comparative Research of Two MOFs Proton Conducting Materials Containing Nitro Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In field of electrochemistry, there has been a growing interest in the potential applications of proton&#8208;conducting metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). Therefore, how to design and synthesize MOFs with high proton conductivity is considered crucial. In this study, two examples of nitro&#8208;containing Cd&#8208;based MOFs, MOF&#8208;1 {[Cd3(TIPE)1.5(NO3)5Cl(H2O)2]&#183;17H2O}n and MOF&#8208;2 {[Cd(TIPE)0.5(nip)]&#183;10H2O}n (TIPE=1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;(1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;1&#8208;yl)phenyl)ethene, H2nip=5&#8208;Nitroisophthalic Acid), had been successfully designed and synthesized, and their proton&#8208;conducting properties were thoroughly investigated. Notably, both materials displayed peak proton conductivity at 98% RH and 90 &#176;C, exhibiting values of 9.13 &#215; 10&#8208;3 and 3.00 &#215; 10&#8208;3 S&#8729;cm&#8208;1 for MOF&#8208;1 and MOF&#8208;2, respectively. The plausible proton conduction pathways and mechanisms were elucidated through structural analyses, water vapor adsorption studies, and the determination of activation energy (Ea) values. It was found that the difference in proton conductivity between MOF&#8208;1 and MOF&#8208;2 was mainly associated with the different water absorption rates of the samples. The uniqueness of this study was that for the first time conducted an in&#8208;depth study of the role of nitrate in proton conduction, providing new ideas for designing materials with excellent proton conductivity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Visible&#8208;light excitation of a family of bimetallic ruthenium polypyridines with the formula [RuII(tpy)(bpy)(&#120583;&#8208;CN)RuII(py)4L]n+ (RuRuLn+), where L = Cl&#8211;, NCS&#8211;, DMAP and ACN, was used to prepare photoinduced mixed&#8208;valence (PI&#8208;MV) MLCT states as models of the photosynthetic reaction center. Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy allowed to monitor photoinduced IVCT bands between 6000 and 11000 cm&#8211;1. Mulliken spin densities resulting from DFT and (TD)DFT computations revealed the modulation of the charge density distribution depending on the ligand substitution pattern. Results are consistent with PI&#8208;MV systems ranging from non&#8208;degenerate Class II to degenerate Class III, with electronic couplings between 1000 and 3500 cm&#8211;1.&#160;These findings guide the control electron localization&#8208;delocalization in charge&#8208;transfer/charge&#8208;separated excited states, like those involved in the photosynthetic reaction center.</dc:description>

         <title>Membrane&#8208;free Electrolysis Production of Hydrogen Peroxide on Low&#8208;Cost Metal&#8208;Free Electrocatalysts for Dye Degradation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The efficient production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) solution was achieved by combining cathodic two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction (2e&#8208; ORR) and anodic two&#8208;electron water oxidation (2e&#8208; WOR) in two half&#8208;reaction cells. h&#8208;BN loaded on carbon fibers (h&#8208;BN@C) is prepared and employed as an anode material to catalyze 2e&#8208; WOR, while sulfonated commercial BP&#8208;2000 carbons (BP&#8208;2000&#8208;SO3H) were prepared as the cathode materials for 2e&#8208; ORR. In a 2 M KHCO3 solution, an overall Faradaic efficiency of 97% and a total H2O2 production rate of 1872 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 over metal&#8208;free electrodes were accomplished in a membrane&#8208;free flow cell. The dilute H2O2 solution could be directly used to degrade cationic Rhodamine B or methyl orange and anionic methylene blue dyes in water. This work proved low&#8208;cost production of dilute H2O2 solution in simple membrane&#8208;free flow cells with single electrolyte and on&#8208;site utilization for efficient dye degradation.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Particle Size Template Method for Controllable Synthesis of Nitrogen&#8208;doped Multilevel Porous Carbon as High&#8208;rate Zn&#8208;ion Hybrid Supercapacitor Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving high rate performance without compromising energy density has always been a critical objective for zinc&#8208;ion hybrid supercapacitors (ZHSCs). The pore structure and surface properties of carbon cathode materials play a crucial role. We propose utilizing a hybrid particle size (20 and 40 nm) magnesium oxide templates to regulate the pore structure of nitrogen&#8208;doped porous carbon derived from the soybean isolate. The multilevel pore structure enhanced ion transport efficiency while also improving the utilization of micropores. Nitrogen doping and oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups enhanced the wettability of carbon materials with aqueous electrolytes and facilitated the chemisorption of Zn2+ on the carbon material surface. The nitrogen&#8208;doped multilevel porous carbon material (HT&#8208;NMPC&#8208;1/1) prepared with a 1:1 mass ratio of the two templates exhibited a specific capacity of 146.65 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.2 A g&#8208;1. Moreover, the Swagelok cells assembled with HT&#8208;NMPC&#8208;1/1 and Zn foil achieved a high energy density of 121.5 W h kg&#8208;1, high power output of 166 W kg&#8208;1, and 93.09% capacity retention after 8000 cycles at 2 A g&#8208;1. Therefore, HT&#8208;NMPC&#8208;1/1 is a highly promising candidate for ZHSCs cathode materials. Furthermore, the novel pore regulation strategy and straightforward preparation method offer valuable reference points for other porous carbon&#8208;based functional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Role of Active Centers in Predicting the Catalyst Turnover: A Theoretical Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water oxidation catalysis has garnered significant attention due to its potential for sustainable energy conversion. Among molecular catalysts, [Fe(OTf)2 (Me2Pytacn)] complexes have exhibited notable turning&#8208;over rates. Although various [M(OTf)2 (Me2Pytacn)] complexes (M = Mn, Co, Ni) have been synthesized, however, the role of active centres has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we apply our newly developed catalytic models, efficiency conceptualization model (ECM) and the maximum kinetic efficiency MaxKinEff framework to assess the role of the active centres in its catalytic performance. Our computational analysis identifies cobalt&#8208;based [Co(OTf)2 (Me2Pytacn)] as a superior alternative for water oxidation reactions. Notably, cobalt catalysts exhibit a longer lifespan (~ 44 days) and higher turnover numbers (TON), with computed values of &#160;(ECM) = 3.30 h&#8208;1, &#160;(ECM) = 3456, (MaxKinEff) = 12.43 h&#8208;1, and &#160;(MaxKinEff) = 3616. These findings suggest that cobalt could play a pivotal role in improving the efficiency of molecular catalysts for water oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Tetramethoxy&#8208;acridiniums for Fluorophores and Organic Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetramethoxy substituted alkyl&#8208;acridiniums are readily available by facile nucleophilic aromatic substitution on tris(dimethoxyphenyl)carbenium, but are non&#8208;fluorescent, presumably due to intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer quenching. In this work we introduce electron withdrawing groups by electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions, leading to fluorescence turn&#8208;on. The acridiniums are moderately fluorescent (&#981;f = 20%) with long fluorescene lifetimes (&#964;f = 9 ns). The positive excited state reduction potentials (E*red = +1.6 V) make the TMAcr+ excellent electron acceptors in the excited state, and efficient reductive photoredox catalysts able to oxidize a broad range of substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Potassium Phosphate&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of C4&#8208;Phosphorylated Quinolines via Cascade Cycloisomerization of Ynones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A cascade phosphorylation cycloisomerization of readily accessible ynones and diphenylphosphine oxides facilitated by potassium phosphate is described, allowing for the straightforward synthesis of C4&#8208;phosphorylated quinoline scaffolds. The formation of a C&#8722;P bond and a C&#8722;N bond is achieved in a single procedure without the need for pre&#8208;assembled quinoline cores prior to phosphorylation. This transformation operates without the requirement for metals or oxidants and exhibits excellent compatibility with various functional groups. Furthermore, antimicrobial activity evaluation demonstrated that the synthesized C4 phosphorylated quinoline derivatives exhibited potent inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus.</dc:description>

         <title>An Efficient Bifunctional Core&#8208;Shell ZIF&#8208;90@ZIF&#8208;67 Composite as a Stable Pickering Interfacial Catalyst for the Deacetalization&#8211;Knoevenagel Tandem Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploiting advanced solid particles is crucial to the construction of Pickering emulsions catalysis. Recently, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been used as ideal emulsifiers stabilizing Pickering emulsions for interfacial catalysis. Although Pickering emulsions stabilized by core&#8208;shell MOFs have significant importance in practical studies, to date there have been very limited reports on this topic. Herein, ZIF&#8208;90@ZIF&#8208;67, a core&#8208;shell material with simultaneous acid&#8208;base bifunctionality, was synthesized by seeded epitaxial growth. It was firstly applied as an emulsifier in Pickering emulsions to catalyze the deacetalization&#8208;Knoevenagel tandem reaction, which exhibited excellent catalytic properties and achieved extremely high yields. Additionally, ZIF&#8208;90@ZIF&#8208;67 showed high stability and remained well repeatable after five cycles. This work provides a platform for the design of structurally and functionally diverse MOF&#8208;based Pickering emulsions interfacial catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>&#960;&#8208;mers and &#960;&#8208;dimers: Two Radical Supramolecular Interactions &#8211; A Tutorial Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this review, the difference between &#960;&#8208;mers (pimers) and &#960;&#8208;dimers (pi&#8208;dimers) will be discussed. Often interchanged or confused in the literature, these two radical interactions lead to different or even opposite physico&#8208;chemical behaviors. This review aims at clarifying the terms &#960;&#8208;mers and &#960;&#8208;dimers and at describing their main physico&#8208;chemical properties to address their differences. Finally, selected literature examples exhibiting the successive formation of &#960;&#8208;mers and &#960;&#8208;dimers within the same systems will be detailed to emphasize the physico&#8208;chemical changes occurring upon conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Bismuth Bound to Transition Metals: Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Olefin Coordination, Reductive Elimination, and Oxidative Addition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of dibenzobismepinyl (C14H10Bi) substituted transition metal complexes of the type [(C14H10Bi)M(CO)x(L)] (M = Mn, Co, Fe) was prepared in salt elimination reactions from a halobismepine and sodium metallates. Irradiation of these complexes with visible light has been investigated, aiming at the elimination of one carbonyl ligand and the concomitant coordination of the bismepine&#8217;s olefin moiety to the transition metal center. The resulting complexes of the type [{&#954;2C,&#954;1Bi&#8208;(C14H10)Bi}M(CO)x&#8722;1(L)] (M = Co, Fe) have been isolated and fully characterized. When two dibenzobismepinyl units are positioned in the coordination sphere of an iron carbonyl complex fragment, reductive elimination / oxidative addition events of the dibismuthane (C14H10Bi)2 have been shown to be relevant. The analytical techniques applied in this work include (heteronuclear) NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, UV/Vis spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy and (TD)&#8208;DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Experimental Characterization of a Sialyl Cation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sialic acids are monosaccharide residues involved in several biological processes. Controlling the stereoselectivity of sialylation reactions is challenging and mechanistic studies on the structure of its intermediate, the sialyl cation, are scarce. Here it is shown that a sialyl cation can be generated and isolated from an ionized sialic acid precursor. This short&#8208;lived species is structurally characterized for the first time using cryogenic infrared spectroscopy. In combination with quantum chemical calculations, the results reveal that the positive charge at the anomeric carbon of the sialyl cation is stabilized by remote participation of the C5&#8208;NHAc group leading to the formation of a bridged structure. In this structure, the &#946;&#8208;side is shielded from nucleophilic attack, potentially explaining the &#945;&#8208;selectivity of this building block in SN1&#8208;type sialylation reactions. Other modes of participation are energetically unfavored and cannot be observed experimentally.</dc:description>

         <title>Active Photonic Glass for Hydrogen Generation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality is vital in many living species since it is responsible for structural iridescent coloration and plays a key role in light harvesting during natural photosynthesis. Developing photoactive materials with such chiral structures is a challenging but promising strategy for energy applications. Here, we describe a straightforward method to establish an active photonic glass obtained through the co&#8208;condensation of&#160;tetramethyl orthosilicate (TMOS) and titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (TAA) dissolved in a liquid crystal formed from cellulose nanocrystalline (CNC). The inorganic glass maintains a long range of chiral nematic ordering, displaying iridescent colors characterized by a Bragg peak reflection. The reflected wavelengths are tuned all over the UV&#8208;visible range, demonstrating that the replica of the chiral nematic structure generates photonic properties. Incorporation of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) into the films is further performed by impregnation/chemical reduction. We show that the charge carrier density and photocatalytic H2 generation were amplified when the photonic band gap edges matched the absorbance of the TiO2 and localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of AuNPs. This photocatalytic glass with chiral nematic ordering and a tunable photonic bandgap paves the way for the development of metamaterials with new applications, such as asymmetric photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Borenium Ion Equivalents Stabilized by BICAAC and Their Implementation as Catalysts in Hydrosilylation of Carbonyls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydride abstraction from the borane adduct, (BICAAC)&#8231;BH3 afforded the hydride bridged dinuclear borenium ion equivalent complexes 1 and 2 that have been characterized by various spectroscopic and spectrometric techniques followed by the assessment of Lewis acidity using the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method. The single crystal X&#8208;ray structure of complex 2 revealed the presence of discrete ions in the solid state. The complex (BICAAC)&#8231;BH2(OTf) (3), obtained from the reaction of (BICAAC)&#8231;BH3 with MeOTf, forms the corresponding boronium cations [(BICAAC)&#8231;BH2(L)]+(OTf)&#8208; on reaction with Lewis bases (L = pyridine (4) and DMAP (5)). Complexes 1 and 2 demonstrated notable catalytic activity in the hydrosilylation of a diverse array of carbonyls using 1.0 mol% catalyst loading (achieving the highest turnover frequency (TOFmax) of up to 1200 h&#8208;1 with benzaldehyde. A broad substrate scope has been presented for aldehydes and ketones decorated with various electron&#8208;donating and withdrawing substituents along with this the hydrosilylation of a few para&#8208;quinone methides has also been presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanical, Thermal, and Morphological Analysis of Himalayan Agave Fiber /GO Coated Fly Ash Hybrid Polypropylene Composites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Composites containing two different types of reinforcements offer a wide range of possibilities and synergistic properties. This study investigates the hybridization effect of chemically active fly ash (FA) (5 wt.%) on the composites made from alkali (1 wt.%) &#8208; APTES silane (2 wt.%) treated Himalayan agave fibers (HAF) (25 wt.%) and polypropylene (PP). Prior to FA activation, the planetary ball mill was used to suitably reduce the particle size of the FA with was confirmed by the dynamic light scattering approach. Secondary reinforcement FA was modified with APTES silane (1 wt.%), followed by treatment with graphene oxide (GO) (0.5, 0.75, and 1 wt.%). The highest tensile strength of 40.47 MPa and modulus of 1.49 GPa were observed for the hybrid composites fabricated from 0.75 and 1.0 wt.% GO treated fly ash. Interestingly, this trend differed for flexural properties, and the highest flexural strength of 53.52 MPa was demonstrated by 0.5 wt.% GO treated FA hybrid composite. Thermal characterization revealed that addition of fiber increased crystallinity but decreased thermal stability, whereas a good wettability of the fiber and FA in matrix was demonstrated through morphological characterization.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of core&#8208;functionalised naphthalene diimides from naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride using a vibratory ball mill: bromination, imidization and Heck&#8208;type reactions.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of 9 core&#8208;functionalised naphthalene diimide (c&#8208;NDI) residues is reported via a 3&#8208;step solvent free synthesis from naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride using only mechanochemical activation. Selective dibromination and subsequent dimidiation were achieved for the first time in a vibratory ball mill, resulting in the key structural intermediate, 2,6&#8208;dibromonaphthalenediimide (DBND), which is the basis for elaboration into a multitude of organic electronic materials. Our new synthesis of DBND is achieved in just 5 hours&#8217; reaction time over two steps compared to typical solution state times of 24 hours. Subsequent Heck&#8208;type cross coupling reactions, with a range of styrene residues, produced a series of c&#8208;NDIs in good yields. The Heck&#8208;type reactions are rapid (1.5 hours), require no additional heating or solvent and are tolerant of atmospheric moisture and air.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;P type charge compensatory synergistic effect for Schottky and efficient photoelectrocatalysis applications: Doping mechanism in (Nb/Re)@WS2/graphene heterojunctions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Band gap engineering based on doped two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) has shown great potential in the design and development of new nano photoelectronic devices and their application in photoelectrocatalysis. However, there are two key issues that are difficult to take into account, namely the impurity levels induced by dopant atoms appear in the forbidden band of the doping system, which can become the recombination center of photogenerated carriers, thereby reducing the photocatalytic efficiency. Compared with the carrier mobility of the corresponding doped systems, that of intrinsic 2D TMDs is too low. Understanding the doping mechanism of heteroatoms in these systems and designing corresponding crystal structures rationally is important for solving these problems. In this study, the crystal structures of co&#8208;doped monolayer WS2 with Nb and Re atoms were designed using density functional theory, and doping systems with graphene (high carrier mobility) were assembled into a heterostructure using the concept of heterorecombination. The N&#8208;P type co&#8208;doping of Nb and Re atoms retained the continuous band characteristics of the original monolayer WS2 while also providing the high carrier mobility of graphene, yielding an excellent multipurpose material for manufacturing high&#8208;speed Schottky devices and efficient water&#8208;splitting H evolution catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Metallo&#8208;Supramolecular Amphiphiles Based on Azadipyrromethenes: Consecutive Pathways to Nanodiscs and Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new class of metallo&#8208;supramolecular amphiphilic dyes 1a, b was constructed by using two azadipyrromethene units which were respectively modified with two hydrophobic alkyl and two hydrophilic oligo(ethylene glycol) chains. The spectroscopic and morphological studies revealed the consecutive self&#8208;assembly pathways of 1a in EtOH/H2O mixed solvent. The monomers of 1a firstly aggregated into the kinetic&#8208;controlled, nanodisc&#8208;shaped Agg. I upon cooling and the latter spontaneously transformed into the thermodynamically more stable Agg. II with a nanosheet morphology. While the non&#8208;fluorescent Agg. I displayed a broad absorption band (&#955;max = 594 nm), the Agg. II displayed a more intensive and narrowed J&#8208;band (&#955;max =693 nm) and a fluorescence band with a maximum at 760 nm (&#1060;fl = 0.1), which could be ascribed to the J&#8208;aggregation induced emission enhancement. The kinetics of Agg. I to Agg. II transformation was further modulated by seed&#8208;initiated supramolecular polymerization with various ratios of Seedagg.II, in which the transformation rate was significantly increased by ca. 2 orders of magnitude compared to the spontaneous process. The supramolecular amphiphile 1b bearing longer hydrophilic chains formed only one type aggregate, which exhibited spectroscopic and morphological properties that were highly comparable with that of Agg. I.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A new class of metallo-supramolecular amphiphilic dyes 1a, b was constructed by using two azadipyrromethene units which were respectively modified with two hydrophobic alkyl and two hydrophilic oligo(ethylene glycol) chains. The spectroscopic and morphological studies revealed the consecutive self-assembly pathways of 1a in EtOH/H2O mixed solvent. The monomers of 1a firstly aggregated into the kinetic-controlled, nanodisc-shaped Agg. I upon cooling and the latter spontaneously transformed into the thermodynamically more stable Agg. II with a nanosheet morphology. While the non-fluorescent Agg. I displayed a broad absorption band (&#955;max = 594 nm), the Agg. II displayed a more intensive and narrowed J-band (&#955;max =693 nm) and a fluorescence band with a maximum at 760 nm (&#1060;fl = 0.1), which could be ascribed to the J-aggregation induced emission enhancement. The kinetics of Agg. I to Agg. II transformation was further modulated by seed-initiated supramolecular polymerization with various ratios of Seedagg.II, in which the transformation rate was significantly increased by ca. 2 orders of magnitude compared to the spontaneous process. The supramolecular amphiphile 1b bearing longer hydrophilic chains formed only one type aggregate, which exhibited spectroscopic and morphological properties that were highly comparable with that of Agg.

         <title>Origins of Catalysis in Non&#8208;Heme Fe(II)/2&#8208;Oxoglutarate&#8208;Dependent Histone Lysine Demethylase KDM4A with Differently Methylated Histone H3 Peptides</title>

         <dc:description>Histone lysine demethylase 4A (KDM4A), a non&#8208;heme Fe(II)/2&#8208;oxoglutarate (2OG) dependent oxygenase that catalyzes the demethylation of tri&#8208;methylated lysine residues at the 9, 27, and 36 positions of histone H3 (H3K9me3, H3K27me3, and H3K36me3). These methylated residues show contrasting transcriptional roles; therefore, understanding KDM4A&#8217;s catalytic mechanisms with these substrates is essential to explain the factors that control the different sequence&#8208;dependent demethylations. In this study, we use molecular dynamics (MD)&#8208;based combined quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods to investigate determinants of KDM4A catalysis with H3K9me3, H3K27me3 and H3K36me3 substrates. In KDM4A&#8208;H3(5&#8208;14)K9me3 and KDM4A&#8208;H3(23&#8208;32)K27me3 ferryl complexes, the O&#8208;H distance positively correlates with the activation barrier of the rate&#8208;limiting step, however in the KDM4A&#8208;H3(32&#8208;41)K36me3, no direct one&#8208;to&#8208;one relationship was found implying that the synergistic effects between the geometric parameters, second sphere interactions and the intrinsic electric field contribute for the effective catalysis for this substrate. The intrinsic electric field along the Fe&#8208;O bond changes between the three complexes and shows a positive correlation with the HAT activation barrier, suggesting that modulating electric field can be used for fine engineering KDM catalysis with a specific substrate. The results reveal how KDM4A uses a combination of strategies to enable near equally efficient demethylation of different H3Kme3 residues.</dc:description>
