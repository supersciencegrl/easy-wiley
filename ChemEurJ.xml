         <title>Recent Developments on Photochemical Synthesis of 1,n&#8208;Dicarbonyls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,n&#8208;dicarbonyls are one of the most fascinating chemical feedstocks finding abundant usage in the field of pharmaceuticals. Besides, they are utilized in a plethora of synthesis in general synthetic organic chemistry. A number of &#8216;conventional&#8217; methods are available for their synthesis, such as the Stetter reaction, Baker&#8208;Venkatraman rearrangement, oxidation of vicinal diols, and oxidation of deoxybenzoins, synonymous with unfriendly reagents and conditions. In the last 15 years or so, photocatalysis has taken the world of synthetic organic chemistry by a remarkable renaissance. It is fair to say now that everybody loves the light and photoredox chemistry has opened a new gateway to organic chemists towards milder, more simpler alternatives to the previously available methods, allowing access to many sensitive reactions and products. In this review, we present the readers with the photochemical synthesis of a variety of 1,n&#8208;dicarbonyls. Diverse photocatalytic pathways to these fascinating molecules have been discussed, placing special emphasis on the mechanisms, giving the reader an opportunity to find all these significant developments in one place.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Pd&#8208;Co&#8208;Doped CdS Heterojunctions as Efficient Platforms in Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 34, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient nanostructured heterojunctions: CdS/palladium/cobalt hybrids were readily prepared through a versatile hydrothermal process. The enhancement of photocatalytic activity towards the degradation of an organic dye originates from efficient carrier separation through either reductive as well as oxidative paths.







Abstract
In this work, we present the structural, optical and photocatalytic properties of CdS semiconducting nanostructures, doped with palladium&#8208; and cobalt&#8208;based species. XRD analysis, corroborated by Raman and XPS, demonstrated the growth of CdS crystallites in the hexagonal structure, whereas solvothermal conversion of neat precursor metal salts resulted in the formation of metallic Pd and cobalt oxide, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy imaging certified the dendritic structure of hybrids, especially in the case where CdS was grown in the presence of either palladium&#8208; or cobalt&#8208;based nanoparticles. XPS surface analysis revealed that a major fraction of metallic Pd nanoparticles was converted to PdO during the in&#8197;situ growth of CdS nanoparticles. The oxidation of Pd nanoparticles could be ascribed to chemisorption of oxygen phases onto the metal surface. The presence of cocatalyst nanoparticles resulted in an appreciable shift of the absorption edge of the ternary hybrids by about 50&#8197;nm. The optimized hybrid was found to photodegrade Orange G dye almost quantitatively within 2&#8197;h, by simulated solar light irradiation. Scavenging experiments revealed that hydroxy radicals were the main transient intermediate, leading to the oxidative degradation of the dye.

         <title>Controlling Morphologies of Redox&#8208;Responsive Polymeric Nanocarriers for a Smart Drug Delivery System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 34, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;responsive polymeric nanocarriers can transform their morphologies in redox&#8208;active cancerous environments. Here, the differences in the morphologies of polymeric nanocarriers according to their hydrophilic/hydrophobic ratio, locations of redox&#8208;responsive functional groups, and redox states (level of oxidants/reductants) under different exposure conditions are reviewed. Moreover, encapsulated photosensitizers can generate excess oxidants, inducing spatiotemporally controlled nanocarrier morphology changes.







Abstract
Redox&#8208;responsive nanocarriers using disulfides or thiols have received considerable attention owing to the higher levels of glutathione (GSH) in cancer cells than those in extracellular fluids. Nevertheless, the normal&#8208;to&#8208;cancer&#8208;cell selectivity of these nanocarriers has not yet been clarified. Nanocarriers exhibit different cytotoxicities depending on the morphologies they adopt under the redox&#8208;active conditions typically existing in cancerous cells. Therefore, not only GSH levels but also reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and other complex cancerous cell conditions must be considered for the development of smart drug delivery systems. In this article, we review the structural design of redox&#8208;responsive polymers that exhibit different morphological changes in environments akin to cancerous cells (e.&#8201;g., GSH&#8208; and ROS&#8208;abundant conditions). In addition, we propose a molecular design for the spatiotemporal control of nanocarrier morphology depending on the levels of both GSH and ROS upon photoirradiation to increase the cytotoxicity difference between normal and cancer cells.

         <title>Insight into the Effect of Stabilizers on Anticancer and Antibacterial Activity of AgBiS2 Nanomaterial</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 34, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The physicochemical interaction of nanoparticles with biological systems differs in the presence and absence of stabilizers (surfactant or polymer molecules) used during their synthesis. In this study, the AgBiS2 nanoparticles produced without stabilizing molecules demonstrated better anticancer activity than the polymer&#8208;coated nanoparticles. This work provides insight into the importance of the clean surface of nanoparticles in nanomedicine.







Abstract
The near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;absorbing AgBiS2 nanoparticles can be excited by single&#8208;wavelength light, which is the primary characteristic of a photo responsive platform. Chemical synthesis of nanomaterials inevitably requires long&#8208;chain organic surfactants or polymers to stabilize them in the nano regime. These stabilizing molecules barricade the interaction of nanomaterials with biological cells. We have produced stabilizer&#8208;free (sf&#8208;AgBiS2) and polymer&#8208;coated (PEG&#8208;AgBiS2) nanoparticles; and assessed their NIR mediated anticancer and antibacterial activity to evaluate the effect of stabilizers. sf&#8208;AgBiS2 showed better antibacterial activity against Gram&#8208;positive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and displayed excellent cytotoxicity against HeLa cells and live 3&#8208;D tumour spheroids compared to PEG&#8208;AgBiS2 both in presence and absence of NIR radiation. The photothermal therapy (PTT) results illustrated the tumour ablation ability of sf&#8208;AgBiS2, which converted light into heat effectively up to 53.3&#8201;&#176;C under NIR irradiation. This work demonstrates the importance of synthesizing stabilizer&#8208;free nanoparticles to produce safe and highly active PTT agents.

[MoIV3MoV6MoVI4O32(OH)2py9](anti&#8208;1) from [MoIV3O2(O2CCH3)(H2O)3]2+ presents the first POMs built of MoIV3/MoV2/d1&#8208;MoV/MoVI and 11e&#8208;reduced Mo derivative of the paratungstic archetype. Anti&#8208;2&#8208;5 represents the first alkoxyl&#8208;bridged MoIV3&#8722;POMs. 6/7 comes from replacing {MoV=O}3+/MoVI in 1 by {CrIIIpy}3+/WVI. Complete substitution of MoVI of 1 with WVI affords diamagnetic syn&#8208;8 resulting from anti&#8594;syn conversion followed by MoV&#8208;MoV bonding. Spin distribution/interaction has been investigated both experimentally and theoretically. Hydrogen transfer catalysis is examined by Lewis catalysis field theory.







Abstract
The first polyoxometalates (POMs) composed of MoIV, MoV2, discrete d1&#8208;MoV and MoVI, [MoIV3MoV6MoVI4O32(&#956;2&#8208;OH)(&#956;3&#8208;OH)py9] (1), was prepared from the solvothermal partial oxidation of [MoIV3O2(O2CCH3)6(H2O)3]ZnCl4 in a mixture of pyridine and water. The MoV=O adduct&#8208;free unit [H2Mo12O33py9] presents the 11e&#8208;reduced Mo derivative of the paratungtic archetype. The use of methanol, ethanol, n&#8208;propyl alcohol and triglycol instead of water produced the isostructural [MoIV3MoV6MoVI4O32(&#956;3&#8208;OH)(&#956;2&#8208;OR)py9](R=CH3, 2; C2H5, 3; C3H7, 4; C2H4OH, 5), providing the first examples of MoIV3&#8722;POMs containing bridging alkoxyl groups. The addition of [CrIIIMo6O24]9&#8722; led to the substitution of {MoV=O}3+ with {CrIII&#8208;py}3+ in the allomer [MoIV3MoV5MoVI4CrIIIO32(&#956;&#8208;OH)2py10] (6). Using a mixture of Mo3 and MoW2 precursors afforded WVI&#8208;incorporated allomer [MoIV3MoV6MoVIWVI3O32(&#956;&#8208;OH)2py9] (7). The complete substitution of MoVI with WVI by using a mixture of the Mo2W, MoW2 and W3 precursors produced the diamagnetic [MoIV3MoV6WVI4O33(&#956;3&#8208;OH)py9]&#8722; (syn&#8208;8) resulting from the anti&#8594;syn conversion between the top and bottom M3 triads concomitant with MoV&#8208;MoV bonding. Both anti&#8208;1&#8208;7 and syn&#8208;8 have been characterized by X&#8208;ray single crystal structural analyses. The spin distribution and magnetic interactions have been investigated by temperature&#8208;dependent magnetic susceptibility and DFT theoretical calculations. Heterogeneous hydrogen transfer catalysis has been examined by the Lewis catalysis field (LCF) theory.

         <title>Promoting Plasmonic Hot Hole Extraction and Photothermal Effect for the Oxygen Evolution Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 34, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Au nanoparticles generate photogenerated charge and hot charge of the LSPR effect after illumination, in which electrons are transported to Pt counter electrode for HER with water. Due to the property of NiCoOx that only transmits holes but prevents the transfer of electrons, the holes are transmitted to NiCoOx to react with OH&#8722; to form O2. Therefore, the separation of hot holes produced by the LSPR effect and its catalytic ability of OER are promoted.







Abstract
Boosting oxygen evolution reaction by local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) provides breakthrough opportunities for the promotion of solar energy conversion; the potential of LSPR, however, has rarely been tapped and investigated. Here, we report the precise regulation of commercial Au nanoparticles plasmonic nanomaterial and OER electrocatalysts, viz., the NiCoOx electrocatalytic layer with hole transport ability and photothermal effect is prepared on the surface of Au nanoparticles by photoelectrodeposition. The NiCoOx layer not only increases the transmission distance of holes generated by plasmonic Au nanoparticles, but also reduce the agglomeration of plasmonic Au nanoparticles during long&#8208;time OER reaction, which greatly improves the OER catalytic ability. The current density of NiCoOx/Au anode achieves 16.58&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 2.0&#8197;V versus RHE, which is about 6.5&#8197;times of pristine NiCoOx anode (2.56&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and 47&#8197;times of pristine Au anode (0.35&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). More importantly, with the LSPR and photothermal effect of plasmonic Au nanoparticles, the NiCoOx/Au anode provides additional current density of 7.01&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 after illumination, and maintains no attenuation for more than 2000&#8197;s. Benefiting from the solution of agglomeration problem of plasmonic Au nanoparticles in the long&#8208;time OER process and the effective utilization of generated holes of plasmonic Au nanoparticles, this design can provide guidance for the application of plasmonic materials in the field of electrocatalysis.

         <title>Reactivity of Yellow Arsenic towards Cyclic (Alkyl)(Amino) Carbenes (CAACs)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 34, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes (CAACs) are reacted with yellow arsenic. Depending on the CAAC used, aggregation, fragmentation and/or rearrangement of yellow arsenic occur to form novel As2&#8208;, iso&#8208;As4&#8208; and As8&#8208;units substituted by CAAC units.







Abstract
Different cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes (CAACs) were reacted with yellow arsenic. Several products [(CAAC&#8208;n)2(&#956;,&#951;1:1&#8208;As2)] (n=1 (1), 4 (2)), [(CAAC&#8208;2)3(&#956;3,&#951;1:1:1&#8208;As4)] (3) and [(CAAC&#8208;3)4(&#956;4,&#951;1:1:1:1&#8208; As8)] (6) were isolated due to the differing steric properties of CAAC&#8208;1&#8208;4. The products contain As2, As4 or As8 units and represent the first examples of CAACs&#8208;substituted products of yellow arsenic. The reactivity of As4 was compared with the reactivities of P4 and the interpnictogen compound AsP3, which led to a series of phosphorus&#8208;containing derivatives such as ([(CAAC&#8208;3)3(&#956;3,&#951;1:1:1&#8208;P4)] (4) and [(CAAC&#8208;3)4(&#956;4,&#951;1:1:1:1&#8208;P8)] (7)) and [(CAAC&#8208;3)3(&#956;3,&#951;1:1:1&#8208;AsP3)] (5). The products were characterized by spectroscopic and crystallographic methods and DFT computations were performed to clarify their formation pathway.

&lt;p&gt;Cyclic &lt;i&gt;(alkyl)(amino)carbenes&lt;/i&gt; (CAACs) are reacted with yellow arsenic. Depending on the CAAC used, aggregation, fragmentation and/or rearrangement of yellow arsenic occur to form novel As&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-, &lt;i&gt;iso&lt;/i&gt;-As&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;- and As&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;-units substituted by CAAC units.

The impact of achiral substituents on the chiral supramolecular aggregation of diketopyrrolo[3,4&#8208;c]pyrrole&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;1H&#8208;triazole dyes is discussed here, giving special emphasis to ECD measurements.







Abstract
We have studied the impact of achiral substituents on the chiral supramolecular architectures of diketopyrrolo[3,4&#8208;c]pyrrole&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;1H&#8208;triazole (DPP) dyes. We decorated the same chiral DPP motif with substituent groups on the nitrogen atoms of the lactam moiety: the hydrophobic n&#8208;octyl alkyl chain, the hydrophilic tri(ethylene glycol) (TEG) chain and the thermo&#8208;cleavable tert&#8208;butoxycarbonyl (t&#8208;Boc) carbamate group. In spite of having identical conjugated chromophore and chiral appendages, in aggregated form the three dyes displayed profoundly different optical, chiroptical, electrochemical and thermal features. ECD measurements revealed differences in the aggregation modes, which would be inaccessible by most other techniques. We found strong chiroptical features, which would have major implications in the context of chiral organic opto&#8208;electronics and in the development of other highly innovative technological applications.

         <title>Resonance&#8208;Enhanced Emission Effects toward Dual&#8208;State Emissive Bright Red and Near&#8208;Infrared Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 34, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Resonance&#8208;enhanced emission effect was successfully employed to design and synthesize red and NIR emitters with merits including dual&#8208;state emission, high brightness, large Stokes shift, and low cost.







Abstract
Resonance&#8208;enhanced emission (REE) effect was discovered and lead to a novel dye family of hydrostyryl pyridinium derivatives in our recent work. Herein, the REE effect was employed to design a red and near&#8208;infrared dual&#8208;state emissive fluorophore family of SW&#8722;OH&#8722;NO2 derivatives which were easily synthesized by coupling an electron&#8208;withdrawing group (W) onto nitro(hydroxyl)styryl (S&#8722;OH&#8722;NO2) through a C=C double bond as &#960;&#8208;bridge. The deprotonation of a phenolic hydroxyl group promoted by a nitro group and the electron&#8208;withdrawing group (W) on the other side of the &#960;&#8208;bridge triggered resonance, resulting in significantly red&#8208;shifted emission. All the resultant SW&#8722;OH&#8722;NO2 compounds showed excellent dual&#8208;state emission behavior. Remarkably, hydrostyryl quinolinium (SQ&#8722;OH&#8722;NO2) is one of the smallest NIR emitter molecular skeleton (&#955;em=725&#8197;nm, MW&lt;400) and showed dual&#8208;state emission characteristics and obvious viscosity&#8208;depended fluorescent behaviors. In addition to constructing electron donor&#8208;acceptor structures and prolonging &#960;&#8208;bridges, the REE effect promises a reliable strategy toward novel fluorophores with small size, long emissive wavelength, and dual&#8208;emission characteristics, and importantly, feasible industrial manufactures and applications due to their easy and low&#8208;cost synthesis strategy.

Ring&#8208;opening cross metathesis of 3,3,4,4&#8208;tetrafluorocyclobutene with electronically rich alkenes as butyl vinyl ether or electron donor group substituted styrenes gave a library of non&#8208;symmetrically substituted tetrafluorodienes, which could be further transformed by cross metathesis with styrenes to fluorinated internal dienes or by oxidation and cyclization to tetrafluorohexopyranoses.







Abstract
As the first known example of ring&#8208;opening cross metathesis (ROCM) of polyfluorinated strained cyclobutenes, ROCM of 3,3,4,4&#8208;tetrafluorocyclobutene with electronically rich alkenes, catalyzed by Grubbs or Hoveyda&#8208;Grubbs 2nd generation precatalysts, gave a small library of non&#8208;symmetrical isolated dienes bearing a tetrafluoroethylene spacer between the double bonds. 1&#8208;Butoxy&#8208;3,3,4,4&#8208;tetrafluorohexa&#8208;1,5&#8208;diene thus formed underwent subsequent regioselective cross metathesis (CM) with a series of styrenes, catalyzed by Hoveyda&#8208;Grubbs 2nd generation precatalyst, leading to non&#8208;symmetrically substituted dienes. 6,6&#8208;Dibutoxy&#8208;3,3,4,4&#8208;tetrafluorohex&#8208;1&#8208;ene, formed by regioselective butoxylation of 1&#8208;butoxy&#8208;3,3,4,4&#8208;tetrafluorohexa&#8208;1,5&#8208;diene, was dihydroxylated and cyclized to the corresponding 3,3,4,4&#8208;tetrafluorohexopyranose.

[Ag(NH3)2]+ can be directly used as an electron acceptor for the oxidation of glucose by AuNPs to accelerate Tollens&#8242; reaction, The formed Ag nanoparticles continued to act as a cascading catalyst to accelerate the reaction and indicator, which provides a possibility for the rapid colorimetric glucose detection.







Abstract
Au nanoparticles (NPs) have been proven to be excellent glucose oxidase (GOx) mimics, which can catalyze the electrons transform pathway from glucose to oxygen. This study confirmed AuNPs can accelerate the reaction between [Ag(NH3)2]+ and glucose under alkaline conditions, which is also known as the Tollens&#8242; reaction, and the possible mechanism was proposed. Here, [Ag(NH3)2]+ instead of O2 acted directedly as an electron acceptor during glucose oxidation catalyzed by AuNPs, accompanied by hydrogen transfer. The as&#8208;synthesized Ag nanoparticles can also catalyze this process, similar to AuNPs, via a unique cascading catalysis mechanism in the Tollens&#8242; reaction. A simple and heatless glucose colorimetric assay can be established based on the plasmonic band of AgNPs with a liner range of 0.6&#8211;22.2&#8197;&#956;M, and the limit of detection is 0.32&#8197;&#956;M.

         <title>Elucidating Conformational Dynamics and Thermostability of Designed Aromatic Clusters by Using Protein Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 34, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromatic residues introduced onto ferritin monomers can form aromatic clusters by self&#8208;assembling of a 24&#8208;mer protein cage. The interhelical aromatic interaction networks transform the T&#8208;shaped configuration into the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking at high temperatures, which contributes to stabilization of the quaternary structures and enhancement of the melting temperature of the scaffold protein.







Abstract
Multiple aromatic residues assemble to form higher ordered structures known as &#8220;aromatic clusters&#8221; in proteins and play essential roles in biological systems. However, the stabilization mechanism and dynamic behavior of aromatic clusters remain unclear. This study describes designed aromatic interactions confined within a protein cage to reveal how aromatic clusters affect protein stability. The crystal structures and calorimetric measurements indicate that the formation of inter&#8208;subunit phenylalanine clusters enhance the interhelix interactions and increase the melting temperature. Theoretical calculations suggest that this is caused by the transformation of the T&#8208;shaped geometry into &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking at high temperatures, and the hydration entropic gain. Thus, the isolated nanoenvironment in a protein cage allows reconstruction and detailed analysis of multiple clustering residues for elucidating the mechanisms of various biomolecular interactions in nature which can be applied to design of bionanomaterials.

         <title>Continuous&#8208;Flow Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Coupling in Water and Organic Solvents Promoted by Blends of Stabilized Convoluted Polymeric Palladium Catalysts and Polymeric Auxiliary Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 34, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and stable catalytic system, which was developed by blending a functional copolymer self&#8208;assembled palladium catalyst with polymeric auxiliary material, allows the continuous&#8208;flow synthesis of various biphenyls in organic solvents or water as the sole solvent.







Abstract
Given that heterogeneous palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C bond formation reactions under continuous&#8208;flow conditions are well suited for the efficient and safe production of pharmaceuticals and functional materials, the development of active and durable catalysts for this purpose is a matter of high practical significance. Here, a previously established molecular convolution methodology was used to synthesize catalysts for Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling under flow conditions by blending convoluted polymeric palladium catalysts (prepared from copolymers of 4&#8208;vinylpyridine and 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylstyrene) and crosslinked polymeric auxiliary materials (prepared from copolymers of divinylbenzene and 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylstyrene). The optimal catalyst exhibited high performance and durability and allowed numerous biaryl products such as liquid&#8208;crystalline materials, organic electroluminescent materials, and pharmaceuticals to be continuously synthesized with turnover frequencies of up to 238&#8197;h&#8722;1. In a demonstration of practical utility, the developed catalytic system was used for the continuous synthesis of two pharmaceuticals (felbinac and fenbufen) in water as the sole solvent.

         <title>Tailoring Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Strategy for Sequence&#8208;Dependent and Thermo/pH Dual&#8208;Responsive Clusteroluminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 34, June 19, 2023. </description>

2,5&#8208;Dimethylfuran&#8208;protected tert&#8208;butyl acrylate was used to achieve sequence regulation of copolymer consisting of pH&#8208;responsive PAA chains and thermo&#8208;responsive PNIPAM chains by the latent monomer strategy and hydrolysis strategy. These non&#8208;conjugated DHCs without traditional chromophores display many typical features of cluster triggered emission (CTE) materials. Notably, the fluorescence intensity of double hydrophilic copolymers was related to the distribution of acrylic acid in polymer chain. In contrast to random and pseudo di&#8208;block DHCs, the gradient DHCs show stronger luminescent intensity. Precisely tuning pH values and temperatures, thermo and pH results in dual&#8208;responsive clusteroluminescence.







Abstract
Rational design of monomer sequence for desired properties is challenging. This study investigates the effect of monomer distribution of double hydrophilic copolymers (DHCs) with electron&#8208;rich units on cluster triggered emission (CTE) capacity. By means of combining latent monomer strategy, reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization and selective hydrolysis technology, the random, pseudo di&#8208;block and the gradient DHCs consisting of pH&#8208;responsive polyacrylic acid (PAA) segments and thermo&#8208;responsive poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) segments were successfully synthesized in a controlled manner. Moreover, the gradient DHCs showed a tremendously increased luminescent intensity due to the distinct hydrogen&#8208;bonding interaction compared to random and pseudo di&#8208;block DHCs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported the direct correlation between luminescent intensity and sequence structure of non&#8208;conjugated polymer. Meanwhile, thermo and pH dual&#8208;responsive clusteroluminescence could be easily performed. This work demonstrates a novel and facile method to tailor the hydrogen&#8208;bonding for the stimuli&#8208;responsive light&#8208;emitting polymers.

         <title>BAr2&#8208;Bridged Azafulvene Dimers with Tunable Energy Levels for Photostable Near&#8208;Infrared Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 34, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor molecules with strong near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption and good photostability were synthesized by using BAr2&#8208;bridged azafulvene dimers as the electron acceptor. The azafulvene dimers form five&#8208;membered ring structures. The HOMO and LUMO energies could be tuned by substituting different aryl groups (Ar=C6H5, C6F5, 3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3) to the boron center.







Abstract
Organic dyes with strong absorption in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region are potentially useful in medical applications, such as tumor imaging and photothermal therapy. In this work, new NIR dyes combining BAr2&#8208;bridged azafulvene dimer acceptors with diarylaminothienyl donors in a donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor configuration were synthesized. Surprisingly, it was found that in these molecules the BAr2&#8208;bridged azafulvene acceptor adopts a 5&#8208;membered, rather than 6&#8208;membered ring structure. The influence of the aryl substituents on the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the dye compounds was assessed from electrochemical and optical measurements. Strong electron&#8208;withdrawing fluorinated substituents (Ar=C6F5, 3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3) lowered the HOMO energy while preserving the small HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap, resulting in promising NIR dye molecules that combine strong absorption bands centered around 900&#8197;nm with good photostability.

The influence of the aryl substituents on the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the dye compounds was assessed from electrochemical and optical measurements. Strong electron-withdrawing fluorinated substituents (Ar=C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, 3,5-(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) lowered the HOMO energy while preserving the small HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap, resulting in promising NIR dye molecules that combine strong absorption bands centered around 900&#8197;nm with good photostability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>From Chemotherapy to Phototherapy &#8211; Changing the Therapeutic Action of a Metallo&#8208;Intercalating RuII&#8208;ReI Luminescent System by Switching its Sub&#8208;Cellular Location</title>

Chemotherapy: off; phototherapy: on. A small change in the structure of a STED&#8208;compatible RuII&#8208;ReI theranostic complex not only switches its intracellular localisation but also its mode of therapeutic action.







Abstract
The synthesis of a new heterodinuclear ReIRuII metallointercalator containing RuII(dppz) and ReI(dppn) moieties is reported. Cell&#8208;free studies reveal that the complex has similar photophysical properties to its homoleptic M(dppz) analogue and it also binds to DNA with a similar affinity. However, the newly reported complex has very different in&#8208;cell properties to its parent. In complete contrast to the homoleptic system, the RuII(dppz)/ReI(dppn) complex is not intrinsically cytotoxic but displays appreciable phototoxic, despite both complexes displaying very similar quantum yields for singlet oxygen sensitization. Optical microscopy suggests that the reason for these contrasting biological effects is that whereas the homoleptic complex localises in the nuclei of cells, the RuII(dppz)/ReI(dppn) complex preferentially accumulates in mitochondria. These observations illustrate how even small structural changes in metal based therapeutic leads can modulate their mechanism of action.

         <title>Reversible Photooxygenation of Anthracene Carboxyimide for Singlet Oxygen Formation: Mechanistic Study and Efficient Nitrite Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 34, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible photooxygenation of an anthracene carboxyimide was achieved by hindering its ability to undergo a competing [4+4] photodimerization reaction and surprisingly yielded chiral hydroperoxides rather than the expected endoperoxide. The racemates were isolated via chiral chromatography, and the mechanism of their photo&#8208; and thermolysis to form 1O2 was investigated. The carboxyimide also proved to be an effective nitrite fluorescence sensor.







Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic endoperoxides are important sources of singlet oxygen (1O2) and their formation from polyacenes is well established. Anthracene carboxyimides are of particular interest as they exhibit excellent antitumor activity and possess unique photochemical properties. However, the photooxygenation of the synthetically versatile anthracene carboxyimide moiety has not been reported due to its competing [4+4] photodimerization reaction. Herein, we describe the reversible photo&#8208;oxidation of an anthracene carboxyimide. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis surprisingly revealed the formation of a racemic mixture of chiral hydroperoxides, rather than the expected endoperoxide. The photoproduct undergoes both photo&#8208; and thermolysis to form 1O2. Activation parameters were derived for the thermolysis and the mechanisms of photooxygenation and thermolysis are discussed. The anthracene carboxyimide also showed high selectivity and sensitivity for nitrite anions in acidic aqueous media and possessed stimuli&#8208;responsive behaviour.

         <title>Four New Sb&#8208;based Orthophosphates: Cation Regulation to Investigate Diversified Structural Architecture</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 34, June 19, 2023. </description>

Two cases of Rb&#8208;containing Sb&#8208;based phosphates were discovered for the first time and the abundant coordination of Sb atoms can effectively regulate the skeleton to produce novel anionic groups, which can greatly enrich the structural chemistry and practical properties of phosphates.







Abstract
In the work, four new Sb&#8208;based phosphates, K4(SbO2)5(PO4)3, Rb(SbO2)2PO4, Rb3(SbO2)3(PO4)2 and Cs3(SbO2)3(PO4)2(H2O)1.32, were successfully synthesized by a high&#8208;temperature melt method. Among them, Rb(SbO2)2PO4 and Rb3(SbO2)3(PO4)2 are the first reported examples of Rb&#8208;containing alkali metal Sb&#8208;based phosphates. They show three&#8208;dimensional (3D) frameworks composed of [Sb8P4O30]&#8734; layer for K4(SbO2)5(PO4)3 and [Sb6P2O20]&#8734; layer for Rb(SbO2)2PO4, and 2D lamellar structure composed of [Sb3P2O10]&#8734; for Rb3(SbO2)3(PO4)2 and Cs3(SbO2)3(PO4)2(H2O)1.32. A detailed structural comparison shows that the structure dimensions for them transfer from 1D to complex 3D framework with the increase of (Sb+P)/O ratio, which affects performances of the compounds. Optical property and energy band structure calculations were also carried out based on the density functional theory (DFT). The present study enriches the diversity of Sb&#8208;based phosphates and paves the way for further explore their optical properties in the future.

         <title>Composites of HKUST&#8208;1@Nanocellulose for Gas&#8208;Separation and Dye&#8208;Sorption Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 34, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper pre&#8208;seeded nanocellulose, Cu@NC, &amp; HKUST&#8208;1 MOF are well integrated into porous composites, HKUST&#8208;1@NCs. The composites exhibit enhanced dye&#8208;uptakes up to 70&#8201;% and CO2 separation property, with an IAST sorption selectivity of 298 for the CO2/N2 (15/85, v/v) gas mixture at 298&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar.







Abstract
In this study, composites of HKUST&#8208;1 MOF with nanocellulose, HKUST&#8208;1@NCs, have been prepared and explored for CO2/N2 gas&#8208;separation and dye&#8208;sorption based applications. Our biopolymer&#8208;MOF composites are prepared via a copper ion pre&#8208;seeding method, in which, the HKUST&#8208;1 crystallites are grown in&#8197;situ on the Cu&#8208;seeded and carboxylate anchored NC fibers for a better interfacial integration between the MOF and the polymer matrices. Static gas sorption studies show the capability of one of our HKUST&#8208;1@NC composites to reach &#8764;300&#8201;% enhancement in the CO2/N2 sorption selectivity compared to the corresponding MOF alone &#8208; blank reference sample prepared at similar conditions. The same composite, C100, in the bulk powder form, shows a remarkable IAST sorption selectivity of 298 (CO2/N2) at 298&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar for the CO2/N2 (15/85, v/v) gas mixture. The relative position of the C100, in the bound plot visualizations of the CO2/N2 separation trade&#8208;off factors indicate a significant potential. The HKUST&#8208;1@NC composites have also been processed along with a polymeric cellulose acetate (CA) matrix as HKUST&#8208;1@NC@CA films to study them as free&#8208;standing mixed&#8208;matrix membranes. The CO2/N2 sorption selectivity, at 298&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar is 600 for one such membrane, C&#8208;120@CA, as bulk sample studied by the static gas sorption. The composite, C120, exhibits a good uptake with an enhancement of 11&#8201;% for alizarin and 70&#8201;% for Congo red in comparison to the uptakes of the corresponding blank reference HKUST&#8208;1 sample, B120.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Copper pre-seeded nanocellulose&lt;/b&gt;, Cu@NC, &amp; HKUST-1 MOF are well integrated into porous composites, HKUST-1@NCs. The composites exhibit enhanced dye-uptakes up to 70&#8201;% and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation property, with an &lt;i&gt;IAST&lt;/i&gt; sorption selectivity of 298 for the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (15/85, v/v) gas mixture at 298&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, composites of HKUST-1 MOF with nanocellulose, HKUST-1@NCs, have been prepared and explored for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas-separation and dye-sorption based applications. Our biopolymer-MOF composites are prepared via a copper ion pre-seeding method, in which, the HKUST-1 crystallites are grown in&#8197;situ on the Cu-seeded and carboxylate anchored NC fibers for a better interfacial integration between the MOF and the polymer matrices. Static gas sorption studies show the capability of one of our HKUST-1@NC composites to reach &#8764;300&#8201;% enhancement in the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sorption selectivity compared to the corresponding MOF alone - blank reference sample prepared at similar conditions. The same composite, C100, in the bulk powder form, shows a remarkable &lt;i&gt;IAST&lt;/i&gt; sorption selectivity of 298 (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) at 298&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar for the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (15/85, v/v) gas mixture. The relative position of the C100, in the bound plot visualizations of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation trade-off factors indicate a significant potential. The HKUST-1@NC composites have also been processed along with a polymeric cellulose acetate (CA) matrix as HKUST-1@NC@CA films to study them as free-standing mixed-matrix membranes. The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sorption selectivity, at 298&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar is 600 for one such membrane, C-120@CA, as bulk sample studied by the static gas sorption. The composite, C120, exhibits a good uptake with an enhancement of 11&#8201;% for alizarin and 70&#8201;% for Congo red in comparison to the uptakes of the corresponding blank reference HKUST-1 sample, B120.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Cytoplasm&#8208;Specific Fluorescent Ligand for Selective Imaging of RNA G&#8208;Quadruplexes in Live Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 34, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorescent ligand is designed as a cytoplasm&#8208;specific probe targeting RNA G4s including VEGF, NRAS and BCL2 in live cancer cells. The ligand is demonstrated for the first time in real&#8208;time visualization of RNA G4&#8208;resolving process with the overexpressed RFP&#8208;tagged DHX36 helicase in live HeLa cells and could be a nontoxic and highly selective fluorescent tool for the study of RNA G4s of cancer hallmarks at low concentration for their cancer biology in live human cells.







Abstract
The development of site&#8208;specific, target&#8208;selective and biocompatible small molecule ligands as a fluorescent tool for real&#8208;time study of cellular functions of RNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s), which are associated with human cancers, is of significance in cancer biology. We report a fluorescent ligand that is a cytoplasm&#8208;specific and RNA G4&#8208;selective fluorescent biosensor in live HeLa cells. The in&#8197;vitro results show that the ligand is highly selective targeting RNA G4s including VEGF, NRAS, BCL2 and TERRA. These G4s are recognized as human cancer hallmarks. Moreover, intracellular competition studies with BRACO19 and PDS, and the colocalization study with G4&#8208;specific antibody (BG4) in HeLa cells may support that the ligand selectively binds to G4s in cellulo. Furthermore, the ligand was demonstrated for the first time in the visualization and monitoring of dynamic resolving process of RNA G4s by the overexpressed RFP&#8208;tagged DHX36 helicase in live HeLa cells.

         <title>Flow Synthesis of Gigantic Porphyrinic Cages: Facile Synthesis of P12L24 and Discovery of Kinetic Product P9L18</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 34, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report continuous flow synthesis of gigantic porphyrinic cages by microfluidic approach. The flow synthesis not only increases the yield of P12L24 but also significantly reduces the reaction times. Moreover, we discover a kinetic product P9L18 by varying reaction conditions.







Abstract
A continuous flow methodology for the facile and high&#8208;yielding synthesis of the porphyrin&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled organic cage, P12L24 is reported, along with the serendipitous discovery of a kinetic product, P9L18 cage, which has been characterized by MALDI&#8208;TOF MS, NMR, and AFM analysis. A theoretical study suggests a tricapped trigonal prismatic geometry for P9L18. Unlike P12L24, P9L18 is unstable and readily decomposes into monomers and small oligomers. While the batch synthesis produces only the thermodynamic product P12L24, the continuous flow process generates not only the thermodynamic product but also kinetic products, such as P9L18, illustrating the advantages of the continuous flow process for the synthesis of self&#8208;assembled cages and the exploration of new non&#8208;equilibrium assemblies.

         <title>Azide&#8208;Substituted 1,2,3&#8208;Triazolium Salts as Useful Synthetic Synthons: Access to Triazenyl Radicals and Staudinger Type Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 34, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azide&#8208;substituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazolium salts are useful synthetic synthons for a range of follow&#8208;up chemistry including the synthesis of triazenyl&#8208;based radicals. Mesoionic carbenes play a crucial role in the stabilization of these radicals.







Abstract
Mesoionic carbenes (MIC) are a popular class of compound that are heavily investigated at the moment. The access to cationic MICs, and the ability of MICs to stabilize radicals are two highly attractive fields that have hardly been explored until now. Here the synthesis and characterisation of three different cationic azide&#8208;substituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazolium salts, used as building blocks for studying their reactivity towards triphenylphosphine are reported, where the reactivity is dependent on the nature of the starting triazolium salt. Furthermore, the cationic triazolium salts were used to develop a series of unsymmetrical MIC&#8208;triazene&#8208;NHC/MIC&#8217; compounds, which can be readily converted to the radical form either by electrochemical or chemical methods. These radicals, which display NIR electrochromism, were investigated using a battery of techniques such as electrochemistry, UV/Vis/NIR and EPR spectroelectrochemistry, and theoretical calculations. Interestingly, the MIC plays an important role in the stabilization of the triazenyl radical, particularly in a competitive role vis&#8208;&#224;&#8208;vis their NHC counterparts. These results shed new light on the ability of MICs to stabilize radicals, and possibly also on their &#960;&#8208;accepting ability.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 34, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and efficient domino process has been developed to provide ready access to a library of functionalized 2&#8208;aminoindoles in good yields, via SET oxidative cyclization, using readily available ethyl propiolate, tosyl azide, and substituted aryl amine as starting materials. The synthetic power of this one&#8208;pot method has been further exemplified in the concise synthesis of biologically important alkaloids, Phaitanthrin E and Tryptanthrin.







Abstract
An efficient domino approach for the synthesis of biologically important 2&#8208;aminoindole derivatives has been developed using CuBr2&#8208;mediated SET oxidative cyclization as a key step. This one&#8208;pot multicomponent strategy utilizes readily available ethyl propiolate, tosyl azide, and substituted aryl amines as starting materials. The generality and scope of this mild method are demonstrated with a wide variety of substrates to furnish functionalized 2&#8208;aminoindoles in good yields. The synthetic power of this strategy is further exemplified in the concise synthesis of biologically important alkaloids, Phaitanthrin E and Tryptanthrin.

&lt;p&gt;An efficient domino approach for the synthesis of biologically important 2-aminoindole derivatives has been developed using CuBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated SET oxidative cyclization as a key step. This one-pot multicomponent strategy utilizes readily available ethyl propiolate, tosyl azide, and substituted aryl amines as starting materials. The generality and scope of this mild method are demonstrated with a wide variety of substrates to furnish functionalized 2-aminoindoles in good yields. The synthetic power of this strategy is further exemplified in the concise synthesis of biologically important alkaloids, Phaitanthrin E and Tryptanthrin.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chalcogen Atom Size Dictates Stability of Benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triamide Polymers: Overlooked Role of Geometrical Fit for Enhanced Hydrogen Bonding</title>

A matter of size! Quantum chemical analyses reveal that replacement of O in benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triamides with the larger chalcogens S or Se enhances the stability of the corresponding hydrogen&#8208;bonded polymers due to two unexpected reasons: i) the monomers have a better geometrical fit, and ii) can engage in stronger covalent and dispersion interactions.







Abstract
Our quantum chemical analyses elucidated how the replacement of O in the amide bonds of benzene&#8208;1,3&#8208;5&#8208;tricarboxamides (OBTAs) with the larger chalcogens S and Se enhances the intermolecular interactions and thereby the stability of the obtained hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular polymers due to two unexpected reasons: i)&#8197;the SBTA and SeBTA monomers have a better geometry for self&#8208;assembly and ii)&#8197;induce stronger covalent (hydrogen&#8208;bond) interactions besides enhanced dispersion interactions. In addition, it is shown that the cooperativity in benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triamide (BTA) self&#8208;assembly is caused by charge separation in the &#963;&#8208;electronic system following the covalency in the hydrogen bonds.

         <title>A Common C2&#8208;Symmetric 2,2&#8217;&#8208;Biphenol Building Block and its Application in the Synthesis of (+)&#8208;di&#8208;epi&#8208;Gonytolide A</title>

An axially chiral biphenol with a common biaryl polyketide motif was investigated. The versatile building block was made accessible by a streamlined synthesis featuring an efficient coupling procedure as well as a DFT&#8208;rationalized starting material bromination and thermodynamically controlled deracemization process. An application was demonstrated in a concise and highly&#8208;diastereoselective synthesis of (+)&#8208;di&#8208;epi&#8208;gonytolide A.







Abstract
A variety of biaryl polyketides exhibit remarkable bioactivities. However, their synthetic accessibility is often challenging. Herein, the enantioselective preparation and synthetic application of an axially chiral 2,2&#8217;&#8208;biphenol building block is outlined that represents a common motif of these intriguing natural products. Based on the highly regioselective and scalable bromination of a phenol precursor, a coupling process by Lipshutz cuprate oxidation was developed. A copper&#8208;mediated deracemization strategy proved to be superior to derivatization or kinetic resolution approaches. Key steps in the overall building block synthesis were rationalized through DFT studies. Utilizing the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;biphenol, a highly diastereoselective five step synthesis of formerly unknown (+)&#8208;di&#8208;epi&#8208;gonytolide A was developed, thus showcasing the building block's general potential for the synthesis of natural products and their derivatives. En route, the first enantioselective construction of a chromone dimer intermediate was established.

         <title>Reactivity of [Cp&#8242;&#8242;2Zr(&#951;1:1&#8722;E4)] (E=P, As) towards Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 34, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of [Cp&#8242;&#8242;2Zr(&#951;1:1&#8722;E4)] (E=P, As) towards main group nucleophiles is investigated to functionalize the polypnictogen unit. With tBuLi as nucleophile, a single organic group is attached to a bridgehead phosphorus atom. The framework can be extended by further reactions with the quenching reagents [Me3O][BF4] and Ph2PCl. Furthermore, a condensation of two initially formed molecules occurs and a complex bearing a P8 unit is obtained. In contrast, reactions with the nucleophiles LiNMe2 and LiCH2SiMe3 lead to an abstraction of one pnictogen atom and the formation of a substituted cyclo&#8208;E3 unit on a neutral Cp&#8242;&#8242;2Zr complex.







Abstract
The functionalization of the polypnictogen ligand complexes [Cp&#8242;&#8242;2Zr(&#951;1:1&#8208;E4)] (E=P (1&#8201;a), As (1&#8201;b); Cp&#8242;&#8242;=1,3&#8208;di&#8208;tertbutyl&#8208;cyclopentadienyl) is focused to modify the features of the polypnictogen unit to explore new synthetic pathways for further transformations. The reaction behavior of 1 towards main group nucleophiles is investigated. The reaction of 1&#8201;a with tBuLi leads to the ionic product Li[Cp&#8242;&#8242;2Zr(&#951;1:1&#8208;P4tBu)] (2) where an organic group is attached to a bridgehead phosphorus atom of the butterfly unit. Further reactions of 2 with quenching electrophilic reagents enable the introduction of other substituents. Moreover, a condensation of 2 to [(Cp&#8242;&#8242;2Zr)2(&#956;,&#951;1:1:1:1&#8208;P8tBu2)] (3), containing a novel P8&#8208;unit, has been observed. The reaction of 1 with LiNMe2 and LiCH2SiMe3 leads to a partial fragmentation of the E4 unit and the compounds [Cp&#8242;&#8242;2Zr(&#951;2&#8208;E3Nu)] (Nu=NMe2: E=P (6&#8201;a), As (6&#8201;b); Nu=CH2SiMe3: E=P (7&#8201;a), As (7&#8201;b)) are formed.

         <title>Converging Stereodivergent Reactions: Highly Stereoselective Formal anti&#8208;Markovnikov Addition of H2O to Mixtures of Olefins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 34, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A formal, two&#8208;step anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition of H2O to diastereomeric mixtures of trisubstituted olefins towards enantio&#8208; and diastereomerically highly&#8208;enriched alcohols is demonstrated. This method relies on the syn&#8208;specific Shi&#8208;epoxidation, followed by a titanocene&#8208;catalyzed epoxide hydrosilylation featuring a directional&#8208;isomerization step to converge the diastereomeric mixtures of epoxides into a single stereoisomer.







Abstract
We describe a highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective two&#8208;step formal anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition of H2O to diastereomeric mixtures of trisubstituted olefins. Our approach overcomes the limits of classical stereospecific addition reactions to olefins for the generation of adjacent stereocenters. In these stereospecific reactions, separation of olefin diastereomers is essential. Our method circumvents the need for such difficult separations by simultaneously employing both diastereomeric olefins in the organocatalytic, highly enantioselective, syn&#8208;specific Shi&#8208;epoxidation to yield diastereomeric oxiranes. The stereochemical model proposes the smallest substituent on the olefin to be stereodefining resulting in an identical enantiotopic approach for both olefin isomers on the less substituted carbon. By employing a stereoconverging epoxide hydrosilylation the identically configured center is retained, while the differing one is converted to a planar radical center that is reduced by a syn&#8208;selective intramolecular hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) from a Ti&#8722;H bond. The observed converging behavior can be attributed to a HAT&#8208;preceding directional isomerization step, that interconverts the obtained rotameric radicals which ultimately leads to high to excellent enantiomeric ratios of the final secondary alcohols.

     alt="Converging Stereodivergent Reactions: Highly Stereoselective Formal anti-Markovnikov Addition of H2O to Mixtures of Olefins"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A formal, two-step&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;anti&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-Markovnikov addition&lt;/b&gt; of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O to diastereomeric mixtures of trisubstituted olefins towards enantio- and diastereomerically highly-enriched alcohols is demonstrated. This method relies on the &lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt;-specific &lt;i&gt;Shi&lt;/i&gt;-epoxidation, followed by a titanocene-catalyzed epoxide hydrosilylation featuring a directional-isomerization step to converge the diastereomeric mixtures of epoxides into a single stereoisomer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We describe a highly diastereo- and enantioselective two-step formal &lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;-Markovnikov addition of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O to diastereomeric mixtures of trisubstituted olefins. Our approach overcomes the limits of classical stereospecific addition reactions to olefins for the generation of adjacent stereocenters. In these stereospecific reactions, separation of olefin diastereomers is essential. Our method circumvents the need for such difficult separations by simultaneously employing both diastereomeric olefins in the organocatalytic, highly enantioselective, &lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt;-specific &lt;i&gt;Shi&lt;/i&gt;-epoxidation to yield diastereomeric oxiranes. The stereochemical model proposes the smallest substituent on the olefin to be stereodefining resulting in an identical enantiotopic approach for both olefin isomers on the less substituted carbon. By employing a stereoconverging epoxide hydrosilylation the identically configured center is retained, while the differing one is converted to a planar radical center that is reduced by a &lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt;-selective intramolecular hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) from a &lt;i&gt;Ti&lt;/i&gt;&#8722;&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt; bond. The observed converging behavior can be attributed to a HAT-preceding directional isomerization step, that interconverts the obtained rotameric radicals which ultimately leads to high to excellent enantiomeric ratios of the final secondary alcohols.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Integrating Tetrathiafulvalene and Nickel&#8208;Bis(dithiolene) Units into Donor&#8208;Acceptor Covalent Organic Frameworks for Stable and Efficient Photothermal Conversion</title>

The combination of tetrathiafulvalene and Ni&#8208;bis(dithiolene) units gives rise to a donor&#8208;acceptor covalent organic framework with high chemical/thermal stability and efficient near&#8208;infrared/solar photothermal conversion performance.







Abstract
Tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) and Ni&#8208;bis(dithiolene) are typical conductive units widely studied in electronics, optics, and photochemistry. However, their applications in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photothermal conversion are often limited by insufficient NIR absorption and low chemical/thermal stability. Herein, we integrate TTF and Ni&#8208;bis(dithiolene) into a covalent organic framework (COF) with stable and efficient NIR and solar photothermal conversion performance. Two isostructural COFs, namely Ni&#8208;TTF and TTF&#8208;TTF, are successfully isolated which are composed of TTF and Ni&#8208;bis(dithiolene) units as donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) pairs or TTF units only. Both COFs show high BET surface areas and good chemical/thermal stability. Notably, compared with TTF&#8208;TTF, the periodic D&#8722;A arrangement in Ni&#8208;TTF significantly lowers the bandgap, leading to unprecedented NIR and solar photothermal conversion performance.

Self&#8208;assembly of gluconamide conjugated naphthalimide amphiphiles (GCNA) into gel rendered an increased electron density in naphthalimide moiety with overall change in energy of 15.33&#215;10&#8722;32&#8197;J via J&#8208;type aggregation. The enriched electron density in the aggregated GCNA via cooperative intermolecular interactions makes it as an effective electron donor in the fabrication of TENG, which is almost 2.4&#8197;times better in performance than the amorphous form.







Abstract
A series of self&#8208;assembling gluconamide conjugated naphthalimide amphiphiles (GCNA) was synthesized and the self&#8208;assembly of GCNA into gel rendered an increased electron density in naphthalimide moiety with an overall change in energy of 15.33&#215;10&#8722;32&#8197;J via J&#8208;type aggregation. SEM analysis and X&#8208;ray diffraction underpinning the nanofibrillar formation, and rheological measurements confirmed the processablity and material fabrication. The enriched electron density in the aggregated GCNA4 via cooperative intermolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions makes it as effective electron donor in the fabrication of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG). The TENG based on GCNA4&#8208;polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) triboelectric pair generated an output voltage, current and power density of &#8764;250&#8197;V, 40&#8197;&#956;A and &#8764;622&#8197;mW/m2 respectively, which is almost 2.4&#8197;times better in performance than the amorphous GCNA4 based TENG. The fabricated TENG can power&#8208;up 240 LEDs, wrist watch, thermometer, calculator and hygrometer.

         <title>Coordination versus Insertion: On the Interaction of 5&#8201;d&#8208;Transition Metal Carbonyl Clusters with Silver(I)</title>

Feeding M&#8722;M bonds: The transition metal carbonyls Re2(CO)10 and Ir4(CO)12 form adducts with silver(I) cations, leading to the respective monocationic 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 cluster ions. Yet the structural motifs differ: insertion and bent&#8208;coordination for Re but edge&#8208;coordination for Ir. Both are discussed and further analyzed with computational methods.







Abstract
The title silver(I) complex salts [Ag{Re2(CO)10}{Re(CO)5}2]+[Al(ORF)4]&#8722; (AgRe4; ORF=&#8208;OC(CF3)3) and [Ag{Ir4(CO)12}2]+[Al(ORF)4]&#8722; (AgIr8) form upon reaction of Ag+[Al(ORF)4]&#8722; and the transition metal carbonyls (TMCs) Re2(CO)10 and Ir4(CO)12 respectively. The solid&#8208;state structure of the AgRe4 cluster shows an unexpected asymmetric coordination motif, wherein the silver(I) cation has inserted into the Re&#8722;Re bond of one Re2(CO)10 moiety, while the other dirhenium carbonyl coordinates only over one metal atom towards the silver(I) cation. The AgIr8 cluster is formed by the edge&#8208;on coordination of two Ir4 tetrahedra and the silver cation in a D2 symmetric fashion with a torsion angle of 46.5&#176;. QTAIM analysis shows bond paths between the silver atom and the nearby metal atoms in all cases, whereas only the non&#8208;inserted Re2(CO)10 moiety shows additional bond paths between the carbonyl ligands and the silver cation. In addition, the insertion of the Ag+ cation into the Re&#8722;Re bond in Re2(CO)10 removes the bond path between the two rhenium atoms. The EDA&#8208;NOCV analysis suggests an increase of the interaction energy between the silver(I) cation and the respective metal carbonyls from the metal centered transition metal carbonyl (TMC) donors W(CO)6&lt;Re2(CO)10&lt;Os3(CO)12&lt;Ir4(CO)12. In all cases, the dominating orbital interaction is &#963;&#8208;donation [TMC]&#8594;Ag+&#8592;[TMC].

Supramolecular chirality is far from being determined only by local stereogenic elements. Three diketopyrrolo[3,4&#8208;c]pyrrole&#8211;1,2,3&#8208;1H&#8208;triazole (DPP) dyes bearing the same chiral appendage R* but decorated with different achiral substituent groups Y showed profoundly different optical, chiroptical, electrochemical and thermal features in their aggregated form. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Punzi, L. Di&#8197;Bari and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300291).

A heterogeneous flow Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling has been carried out. A water or aqueous organic solution of aryl halides and arylboronic acids (left&#8208;hand side) was continuously injected into a flow column cartridge filled with convoluted polymeric Pd catalysts and stabilizing polymeric auxiliary materials (orange balls) along with sea sand (white balls). The products, which included liquid crystals, pharmaceutical compounds, and organic LED compounds, were eluted from the column (right&#8208;hand side).

         <title>&#955;3&#8208; and &#955;5&#8208;Iodanes: Substituent Effects and Pseudorotation/Hypervalent Twisting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 34, June 19, 2023. </description>

&#955;3&#8208; and &#955;5&#8208;iodanes exhibit positional isomerization through pseudorotation or twisting; the latter have been invoked for the stability as well as the reactivities of iodanes. Judicious exploitation of sterics around iodine atom of the iodane is found to enhance its reactivity. This review collates the literature developments on the effect of substituents and twisting/pseudorotation in iodanes, and their synthetic applications.







Abstract
Hypervalent iodine (III and V) compounds exhibit positional isomerization through pseudorotation or twisting; the latter have been invoked for the stability as well as the reactivity of &#955;3&#8208; and &#955;5&#8208;iodanes. By judicious exploitation of sterics, the twisting process in iodanes can be facilitated to promote reactivity. For example, ortho&#8208;substitution in &#955;3&#8208; and &#955;5&#8208;iodanes accelerates &#945;&#8208;tosyloxylation of ketones and oxidation of alcohols. The enhancement of reactivity arises from sterically&#8208;induced non&#8208;planarity and the resultant weakening of the 3c&#8211;4e bonds involving the hypervalent iodine atom. The ortho&#8208;substitution constitutes an important strategy to maneuver reactivity, control selectivity, and develop new catalysts, including chiral, for diverse reactions. This review entails coverage of the literature developments in regard to the effect of substituents and twisting/pseudorotation on the stability as well as the reactivity of hypervalent &#955;3&#8208; and &#955;5&#8208;iodanes, and the application of the latter for synthetic transformations.

         <title>Antimony Oxides&#8208;Based Anode Materials for Alkali Metal&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 34, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the research progress of antimony oxide&#8208;based anode materials for alkali metal&#8208;ion storage, including electrochemical reaction mechanism and improvements in lithium/sodium/potassium&#8208;ion storage performance, as well as an outlook on the application prospects.







Abstract
With the increasing demand for renewable energy, alkali metal&#8208;ion (lithium/sodium/potassium&#8208;ion) batteries play more and more important roles in the field of static storage and electrical vehicle industry. Novel anode materials with high reversible capacity, safety and long&#8208;term cycling stability are desiderated to meet the ever&#8208;growing demand for alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries with high electrochemical performance. Antimony oxides (SbxOy) show electrochemical reaction activity with all of lithium, sodium and potassium, and are expected to be promising anode materials for alkali metal&#8208;ion storage due to their high theoretical capacities, appropriate operating potential and excellent safety properties. This review is devoted to overview the research progress on reaction mechanism and improvements in electrochemical performance of antimony oxides for alkali metal&#8208;ion storage, and look forward to their further prospects.

         <title>Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Based AIE Supramolecular Polymer Networks Exhibiting Various Fluorescence to Achieve Visible Surveillance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is significant to achieve visual surveillance of the formation process for supramolecular polymer networks (SPNs). A special AIEgen was introduced into SPNs constructed by host&#8211;guest recognition between pillar[5]arene and pyridine salt. With rising cross&#8208;linking degree, the fluorescence color changes from blue to green due to the gradual aggregated AIEgen, enabling the formation process becoming visually.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymer networks (SPNs) based on pillar[n]arene are widely studied and it is known that evolution from linear polymers to SPNs occurs as a progressive process, which is of importance to monitor the detailed morphology throughout the process. Yet, the current reports related to that distinction by employing fluorescence approach have realized confined success, it still remains a challenge to distinguish the various states visually. Herein, a fluorescent group of the pyrene benzohydrazonate&#8208;based (PBHZ&#8208;based) derivative is introduced into the pillar[5]arene based SPNs gained from host&#8211;guest recognition, enabling the visual monitoring during the formation of SPNs. The whole visual detection was based on the fluorescence color transition ranging from blue to green relying on the gradual aggregated PBHZ molecules upon the increasing cross&#8208;linking degree. Besides, the stimuli&#8208;responsiveness of this SPNs was confirmed that increasing the temperature or adding a reducing agent would reduce the cross&#8208;linking degree.

         <title>Fully Conjugated Benzyne&#8208;Derived Three&#8208;Dimensional Porous Organic Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of a 3D porous organic polymer starting from a simple 0D bistriflate precursor via in&#8197;situ CsF catalyzed formation of benzyne. This is the first demonstration of 3D polymer being prepared from a single and simple precursor. The resulting benzyne&#8208;derived porous organic polymer showed 544&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 surface area and IAST CO2/N2 selectivity of 65.4







Abstract
Porous organic polymers (POPs) have gained tremendous attention owing to their chemical tunability, stability and high surface areas. Whereas there are several examples of fully conjugated two&#8208;dimensional (2D) POPs, three&#8208;dimensional (3D) ones are rather challenging to realize in the absence of structural templates. Herein, we report the base&#8208;catalyzed direct synthesis of a fully conjugated 3D POPs, named benzyne&#8208;derived polymers (BDPs), containing biphenylene and tetraphenylene moieties starting from a simple bisbenzyne precursor, which undergoes [2+2] and [2+2+2+2] cycloaddition reactions to form BDPs primarily composed of biphenylene and tetraphenylene moieties. The resulting polymers exhibited ultramicroporous structures with surface areas up to 544&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and very high CO2/N2 selectivities.

Towards heterocyclic diversity: A highly diastereoselective organocatalyzed domino vinylogous sulfa&#8208;Michael&#8208;aldol&#8208;cyclocondensation (VMAC) reaction has been developed using alkylidene Meldrum's acid as dienes highlighting two vinylogous steps, namely an unprecedented sulfa&#8208;1,6&#8208;conjugate addition and a diastereoselective aldol reaction triggering a formal (4+2) cycloaddition, which opens a new route to bio&#8208;relevant and original tricyclic thiochroman derivatives.

         <title>Substituted meta[n]Cycloparaphenylenes: Synthesis, Photophysical Properties and Host&#8211;guest Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three different sized cyano&#8208;meta[n]cycloparaphenylenes (CN&#8208;m[n]CPPs) have been prepared for investigation of their photophysical properties. Furthermore, CN&#8208;m[6]CPP served as key substrate to demonstrate the versatility of the nitrile functionality and therefore a general concept towards functionalized m[n]CPPs was developed. Additionally, CN&#8208;m[10]CPP was used to report the first association constant of a m[10]CPP with fullerene C60.







Abstract
Breaking the centrosymmetry of [n]cycloparaphenylenes ([n]CPPs) by one meta connection, leads to bright emission in the typically non&#8208;fluorescent smaller derivatives, conserving their size dependent emissive properties. Using the building block strategy for [n]CPPs, different nitrile substituted meta[n]CPPs (n=6, 8, 10) have been prepared. The nitrile substituent offers a convenient handle for functional group conversions (e.g., carboxylic acid, amide, aldehyde, as well as 1H&#8208;tetrazole). Besides the synthetic work, the photophysical properties of these novel m[n]CPP derivatives have been characterized. Additionally, the host&#8211;guest ability of cyano&#8208;m[10]CPP has been explored by studying its complexation with fullerene C60. These insights open new applications of meta[n]CPPs as fluorophore in synthetic organic chemistry, material sciences as well as biomedical research.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transition from the square cylinder phase to the rectangular cylinder phase is a second&#8208;order transition that accompanies the transition of the free&#8208;energy landscape from one minimum to two minima. The prolate contour lines of the free&#8208;energy landscape indicate the weak stability of the square phase in the 
 copolymer.







Abstract
Recently, a few AB&#8208;type multiblock copolymers have been successfully designed to form stable square cylinder phase based on self&#8208;consistent field theory (SCFT) calculations. The previous works only identify the stability region of the square phase but not analyzing its stability, which is closely related to the free&#8208;energy landscape. In this work, we have reexamined the stability of the square phase in 
 linear pentablock and 
 star triblock copolymers by drawing the free&#8208;energy landscape with respect to the two dimensions of a rectangular unit cell. Our results demonstrate that the square phase continuously transfers to the rectangular phase as the degree of packing frustration is gradually released. Moreover, the prolate contour lines of the free&#8208;energy landscape indicate the weak stability of the square phase in the 
 copolymer. In contrast, the stability of the square phase is notably improved in the 
 copolymer due to its enhanced concentration of bridging configurations. Our work sheds light on the understanding of the stability of the square cylinder phase in block copolymers. Accordingly, we propose some possible strategies for further designing new AB&#8208;type block copolymer systems to obtain more stable square phase.

         <title>Polymer Nanoantidotes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymer nanoantidotes implement the detoxification process through three different patterns, physical interaction, chemical bonding, and biomimetic clearance, and their significant efficacy speculates on the opportunities for clinical application.







Abstract
Intoxication is one of the most common causes of accidental death globally. Although some antidotes capable of neutralizing the toxicity of certain xenobiotics have become well established, the current reality is that clinicians primarily rely on nonspecific extracorporeal techniques to remove toxins. Nano&#8208;intervention strategies in which nanoantidotes neutralize toxicity in&#8197;situ via physical interaction, chemical bonding, or biomimetic clearance have begun to show clinical potential. However, most nanoantidotes remain in the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept stage, and the difficulty of constructing clinical relevance models and the unclear pharmacokinetics of nanoantidotes hinder their translation to clinic. This Concept reviews the detoxification mechanisms of polymer nanoantidotes and predicts the opportunities and challenges associated with their clinical application.

         <title>Fast Visualized Conformational Transition of Polyphenylacetylenes with Stepwise Tunable Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel thermoresponsive polyphenylacetylene shows reversible conformation transition, fluorescent and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) switch. The conformational transition could be read out via the change of visible fluorescence signals. Moreover, the polymers displayed switchable CPL performance and the luminescent dissymmetry factor could be stepwise amplified by forming chiral aggregates or liquid crystalline structure.







Abstract
Two novel poly(3,5&#8208;diamide substituted phenylacetylene)s bearing L&#8208; or D&#8208;alanine residues with a long alkyl chain were synthesized. In low polar or apolar solvents, the polymers adopted contracted cis&#8208;cisoid helix showing strong yellow fluorescence, which was transferred to stretched cis&#8208;transoid helix by adding polar solvents or decreasing temperature, accompanied with the disappearance of fluorescence. The critical conformational transition temperature could be readily tuned in a wide range by altering the content of polar solvent, and the conformational variation at molecular level could be directly read out via the change in fluorescent property. The synergistical participation of amide and ester groups in the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds accelerated the conformational transition rate, resulting in remarkable reduction of hysteresis. Moreover, the polymers displayed switchable CPL performance and the luminescent dissymmetry factor could be stepwise amplified by forming chiral aggregates or liquid crystalline structure. This study may open a new avenue for the development of controllable helical structure&#8208;based smart CPL materials.

         <title>Push&#8208;Pull Bridged Distyrylbenzene with Highly Bright Solid&#8208;State Red&#8208;Orange Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A red&#8208;emitting aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen (AIEgen) is realized by introducing a bridging structure into push&#8208;pull distyrylbenzene.







Abstract
Multiple emission colors in solid&#8208;state organic fluorophores with the same main skeleton are essential for improving the performance of light&#8208;emitting devices/materials. Specifically, emission in the red/near&#8208;infrared region is of great importance in the biological field. Previously, we developed di&#8208;bridged&#8208;distyrylbenzene DBDB[7] with high&#8208;brightness solid&#8208;state blue and aggregation&#8208;induced emissions (AIE) by introducing the bridging structures of a seven&#8208;membered ring into the vinylene groups of distyrylbenzene (DSB). Herein, we synthesize MNDBDMeODB[7] (1), which features substituted methoxy and malononitrile groups as donor and acceptor groups, respectively, in DBDB[7]. In solvents more polar than THF, MNDSDMeOB (3), which has the same main skeleton as 1 but without bridges, shows no emission in the solid state, whereas 1 exhibits highly bright red&#8208;orange emission in the solid state owing to the suppression of intermolecular electronic interactions by the bridges and the AIE property. We also synthesize MNDSD(EHO)B (2) in which the methoxy groups of 3 are replaced by ethylhexyloxy groups, thus disrupting the crystallinity of the molecule. 2 exhibits positive fluorescence solvatochromism and has a high fluorescence quantum yield in the solid state as a red&#8208;emitting DSB derivative. The solid&#8208;state emission properties of 1 and 2 will improve the applicability of DSBs and functionalities of light&#8208;emitting devices/materials.

         <title>London Dispersion Effects on the Stability of Heavy Tetrel Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A review on the most recent findings of dispersion energy donor (DED) ligands and their effects on the stabilization of heavier group&#8197;14 elements is presented. We specifically discuss DED ligand effects on the structures and reactivities of diplumbynes, distannenes and cyclotristannanes.







Abstract
London dispersion (LD) interactions, which stem from long&#8208;range electron correlations arising from instantaneously induced dipoles can occur between neighboring atoms or molecules, for example, between H atoms within ligand C&#8722;H groups. These interactions are currently of interest as a new method of stabilizing long bonds and species with unusual oxidation states. They can also limit reactivity by installing LD enhanced groups into organic frameworks or ligand substituents. Here, we address the most recent advances in the design of LD enhanced ligands, the sterically counterintuitive structures that can be generated and the consequences that these interactions can have on the structures and reactivity of sterically crowded heavy group&#8197;14 species.

         <title>A Mild Synthesis of Aryl Triflates Enabling the Late&#8208;Stage Modification of Drug Analogs and Complex Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a highly convenient strategy to convert phenols into the corresponding aryl triflates using a newly discovered reagent in presence of a fluoride source. The reactions are generally complete within a few minutes at room temperature. The mild conditions allow the late&#8208;stage O&#8208;triflation of complex peptides bearing challenging side chains like arginine and histidine. We show that aryl triflates can be an interesting moiety for medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
We report the discovery of a straightforward protocol to convert phenols into the corresponding aryl triflates using 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;one in the presence of a fluoride source. This novel reagent can be handled without any precautions to exclude air or moisture making this method highly convenient. The reactions generally show very clean conversions within only a few minutes at room temperature. The mild conditions allow the so far unprecedented O&#8208;triflation of tyrosine in peptides bearing challenging side chains present for example in arginine and histidine including the late&#8208;stage triflation of complex bioactive peptides. We show how aryl triflates &#8211; an interesting but so far underutilized group &#8211; can be used to optimize physicochemical and in&#8197;vitro properties of compound series in medicinal chemistry. We believe that this method is highly attractive for applications in peptide functionalization as well as automated and medicinal chemistry.

     alt="A Mild Synthesis of Aryl Triflates Enabling the Late-Stage Modification of Drug Analogs and Complex Peptides"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;We report a highly convenient strategy to convert phenols&lt;/b&gt; into the corresponding aryl triflates using a newly discovered reagent in presence of a fluoride source. The reactions are generally complete within a few minutes at room temperature. The mild conditions allow the late-stage &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-triflation of complex peptides bearing challenging side chains like arginine and histidine. We show that aryl triflates can be an interesting moiety for medicinal chemistry.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report the discovery of a straightforward protocol to convert phenols into the corresponding aryl triflates using 1-methyl-3-((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)-1,3-dihydro-2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-benzo[&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;]imidazol-2-one in the presence of a fluoride source. This novel reagent can be handled without any precautions to exclude air or moisture making this method highly convenient. The reactions generally show very clean conversions within only a few minutes at room temperature. The mild conditions allow the so far unprecedented &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-triflation of tyrosine in peptides bearing challenging side chains present for example in arginine and histidine including the late-stage triflation of complex bioactive peptides. We show how aryl triflates &#8211; an interesting but so far underutilized group &#8211; can be used to optimize physicochemical and in&#8197;vitro properties of compound series in medicinal chemistry. We believe that this method is highly attractive for applications in peptide functionalization as well as automated and medicinal chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)porphyrin (1) and tetrakis(4&#8208;acetamidophenyl)porphyrin (2) were dissolved in water with the incorporation of a polysaccharide (&#955;&#8208;carrageenan (CGN)) as a water&#8208;solubilizing agent. Although the photodynamic activity of the CGN&#8208;2 complex was considerably lower than that of the CGN&#8208;1 complex, the selectivity index (SI; IC50 in a normal cell/IC50 in a cancer cell) of the CGN&#8208;2 complex was considerably higher than that of the CGN&#8208;1 complex. This is because the photodynamic activity of the CGN&#8208;2 complex was significantly affected by the intracellular uptakes by the normal and cancer cells. During in vivo experiments, the CGN&#8208;2 complex inhibited tumor growth under light irradiation with high blood retention compared with the CGN&#8208;1 complex and Photofrin, which exhibited lower blood retention. This study showed that the photodynamic activity and SI are influenced by substituent groups of arene in the meso&#8208;positions of porphyrin analogs.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Chemistry and Specific Surface Area rule the Efficiency of Gold Nanoparticle Sensitizers in Proton Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are known radiosensitizers in proton therapy (PT) applicable for the treatment of solid tumors, where they amplify production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, it is underexplored how this amplification is correlated with the AuNPs&#180; surface chemistry. To clarify this issue, we fabricated ligand&#8208;free AuNPs of different mean diameters by laser ablation in liquids (LAL) and laser fragmentation in liquids (LFL) and irradiated them with clinically relevant proton fields using water phantoms. ROS generation was monitored by the fluorescent dye 7&#8208;OH&#8208;coumarin. Our findings reveal an enhancement of ROS production driven by I) increased total particle surface area, II) utilization of ligand&#8208;free AuNPs avoiding sodium citrate as a radical quencher ligands, and III) a higher density of structural defects generated by LFL synthesis, indicated by surface charge density. Based on these findings it may be concluded that the surface chemistry is a major and underexplored contributor to ROS generation and sensitizing effects of AuNPs in PT. We further highlight the applicability of AuNPs in vitro in human medulloblastoma cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Factors Controlling Complex Morphologies of Isomorphous Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate here how nitrate salts of bivalent copper, nickel, cobalt, and manganese, along with an achiral organic ligand, assemble into various structures such as symmetrical double&#8208;decker flowers, smooth elongated hexagonal bipyramids, and hexagonal prisms. Large morphological changes occur in these structures because of different metal cations, although they maintain isomorphous hexagonal crystallographic structures. Metal cations with stronger coordination to ligands (Cu,&#160;Ni) tend to form uniform crystals with unusual shapes, whereas weaker coordinating metal cations (Mn,&#160;Co) produce crystals with more regular hexagonal morphologies.&#160; The unusual flower&#8208;like crystals formed with copper nitrate have two pairs of six symmetrical petals with hexagonal convex centers. The texture of the petals indicates dendritic growth. Two different types of morphologies were formed by using different copper nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ligand ratios. An excess of the metal salt results in uniform and monodisperse hexagonal crystals, whereas the use of an excess of ligand results in double&#8208;decker morphologies. Mechanistically, an intermediate structure was observed with slightly concave facets and a domed center. Such structures&#160;likely play a key role in the formation of double&#8208;decker crystals that can be formed by fusion processes. The coordination chemistry results in isostructural chiral frameworks consisting of two types of continuous helical channels.</dc:description>

         <title>Impact of Catalyst Deuteration on the Reactivity of Chiral Phase&#8208;Transfer Organocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Site&#8208;specifically deuterated organocatalysts were prepared and found to show improved reactivity over the non&#8208;deuterated analogs. Two privileged C2&#8208;symmetric chiral binaphthyl&#8208;modified tetraalkylammonium salts were selected for this study. The stability of these phase&#8208;transfer catalysts was generally improved by site&#8208;specific deuteration, though the degree of improvement was structure&#8208;dependent. In particular, a large secondary kinetic isotope effect was observed for the tetradeuterated phase&#8208;transfer catalyst. The performance of these deuterated catalysts in the asymmetric catalytic alkylation of amino acid derivatives was better than that of non&#8208;deuterated analogs at low catalyst loadings. The results suggest that catalyst&#8208;deuteration is a promising strategy for enhancing the stability and performance of organocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Formation of CoP/Co3O4 Heterojunction for Efficient Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical water splitting is an environmentally friendly and effective energy storage method. However, it is still a huge challenge for preparing no&#8208;noble metal based&#8208;electrocatalysts which possess high activity and long&#8208;term durability to realize efficient water splitting. Here, we put forward a novel method of low&#8208;temperature phosphating to prepare CoP/Co3O4 heterojunction nanowires catalyst on titanium mesh (TM) substrate for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and overall water splitting. CoP/Co3O4@TM heterojunction showed an excellent catalytic performance and long&#8208;term durability in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. The overpotential of CoP/Co3O4@TM heterojunction was only 257 mV at 20 mA cm&#8208;2 during the OER process, and it could work stably more than 40 h at 1.52 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE). During the HER process, the overpotential of CoP/Co3O4@TM heterojunction was only 107 mV at &#8208;10 mA cm&#8208;2. &#160;More importantly, when CoP/Co3O4@TM heterojunction were used as anodic and cathodic electrocatalysts, respectively, they displayed 10 mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.59 V. The Faradaic efficiencies of OER and HER were 98.4% and 99.4%, respectively. It was more excellent than the Ru/Ir&#8208;based noble metal electrocatalysts and other non&#8208;noble metal electrocatalysts which have been reported for overall water splitting.</dc:description>

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Evaluation of Biological Activity of Ferrocene&#8208;Ispinesib Hybrids &#8208; Impact of a Ferrocenyl Group on the Antiproliferative and KSP Inhibitory Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the aim to combine more than one biologically&#8208;active component in a single molecule, derivatives of ispinesib and its (S) analogue were prepared that featured ferrocenyl moieties or bulky organic substituents. Inspired by the strong kinesin spindle protein (KSP) inhibitory activity of ispinesib, the compounds were investigated for their antiproliferative activity. Among these compounds, several derivatives demonstrated significantly higher antiproliferative activity than ispinesib with nanomolar IC50&#160;values against cell lines. Further evaluation indicated that the antiproliferative activity is not directly correlated with their KSP inhibitory activity while docking suggested that several of the derivatives may bind in a manner similar to ispinesib. In order to investigate the mode of action further, cell cycle analysis and reactive oxygen species formation were investigated. The improved antiproliferative activity of the most active compounds may be assigned to synergic effect of various factors such as KPS inhibitory activity due to ispinesibe&#8208;core and ability to generate ROS and induce mitotic arrest.</dc:description>

         <title>Modified Peptide Molecules As Potential Modulators of Shelterin Protein Functions; TRF1</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we present studies on relatively new and still not well&#8208;explored potential anticancer targets which are shelterin proteins, in particular the TRF1 protein can be blocked by in silico designed "peptidomimetic" molecules. TRF1 interacts directly with the TIN2 protein, and this protein&#8208;protein interaction is crucial for the proper functioning of telomere, which could be blocked by our novel modified peptide molecules. Our chemotherapeutic approach is based on assumption that modulation of TRF1&#8208;TIN2 interaction may be more harmful for cancer cells as cancer telomeres are more fragile than in normal cells. We have shown in vitro within SPR experiments that our modified peptide PEP1 molecule interacts with TRF1, presumably at the site originally occupied by the TIN2 protein. Disturbance of the shelterin complex by studied molecule may not in short term lead to cytotoxic effects, however blocking TRF1&#8208;TIN2 resulted in cellular senescence in cellular breast cancer lines used as a cancer model. Thus, our compounds appeared useful as starting model compounds for precise blockage of TRF proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Oriented External Electric Field Effects on the Activation of Aryl CO Bond in Anisole using Rh(PEP) (E=Al, B, Ga) Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The present work reports a DFT&#8208;based mechanistic investigation of aryl C&#8208;O bond activation in anisole catalysed by a Rh&#8208;Al pincer&#8208;type complex at room temperature. The study is extended to analogues Rh&#8208;E complexes based on group 13 elements (E=B/Ga). Our results show a preference for the heterolytic cleavage pathway over oxidative addition in the C&#8208;O bond activation. The calculated barriers range from 16 to 36 kcal/mol, following the order: E=Al &lt; E=Ga &lt; E=B. We observed a strong correlation between the activation barriers and the local electric field (LEF) at the Rh metal centre for the studied Rh&#8208;E complexes. Additionally, we examined the ability of Oriented External Electric Fields (OEEF) to lower the reaction barrier by applying the OEEF along the direction of electron reorganization, i.e., &#8220;the reaction axis&#8221;. Our results demonstrate the significant effect of applied OEEF on the aryl C&#8208;O bond activation in Rh&#8208;E systems. Furthermore, we showcase the effect of OEEF on the C&#8208;O bond activation using modified Rh&#8208;E (E=B, Al, or Ga) complexes, where electronic structure modifications enable a more efficient barrier control by the OEEF. Notably, applying a moderate field strength reduces the high reaction barrier for the Rh&#8208;B system by ~13 kcal/mol.</dc:description>

         <title>A Doubly Dissipative System Driven by Chemical and Radiative Stimuli</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The operation of a dissipative network composed of two or three different crown&#8208;ether receptors and an alkali metal cation can be temporally driven by the use (combined or not) of two orthogonal stimuli of different nature. More specifically, irradiation with light at a proper wavelength and/or addition of an activated carboxylic acid, are used to modulate the binding capability of the above crown&#8208;ethers towards the metal ion, allowing to control over time the occupancy of the metal cation in the crown&#8208;ether moiety of a given ligand. Thus, application of either or both of the stimuli to an initially equilibrated system, where the metal cation is distributed among the crown&#8208;ether receptors depending on the different affinities, causes a programmable change in the receptor occupancies. Consequently, the system is induced to evolve to one or more out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium states with different distributions of the metal cation among the different receptors. When the fuel is exhausted or/and the irradiation interrupted, the system reversibly and autonomously goes back to the initial equilibrium state. Such results may contribute to the achievement of new dissipative systems that, taking advantage of multiple and orthogonal stimuli, are featured with more sophisticated operating mechanisms and time programmability.</dc:description>

         <title>Cu2P7&#8208;CoP Heterostructure Nanosheets Enable High&#8208;Performance of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu2P7&#8208;CoP heterostructure nanosheets were designed as the electrocatalyst for conversion of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural into 2, 5&#8208;furanedioic acid, achieving superior electrooxidation performance.







Abstract
Electrooxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfural (HMF) into 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylicacid (FDCA) has been regarded as a promising sustainable approach to achieve value&#8208;added chemicals. However, it is still impeded by the unsatisfactory performance of electrocatalysts. Here, Cu2P7&#8208;CoP heterostructure nanosheets were reported to enable powerful HMF electrooxidation. The Cu2P7&#8208;CoP heterostructure nanosheets were fabricated by microwave&#8208;assisted deep eutectic solvent (DES) approach, along with subsequent phosphiding. The Cu2P7&#8208;CoP heterostructure nanosheets enabled a superb 100&#8201;% HMF conversion at 1.43&#8197;V (vs. RHE) with 98.8&#8201;% FDCA yield and 98&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency (FE), demonstrating its promising application in HMF electrooxidation. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, open&#8208;circuit potential (OCP) approach and density functional theory (DFT) calculation uncovered that the electron transfer and redistribution between Cu2P7 and CoP improved the adsorption capacity of HMF and modulated the catalytic performance. This study not only offered a powerful electrocatalyst for HMF electrooxidation, but also provided a conceptually new strategy for the heterostructure catalyst design.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Electrocatalysts for the Selective 2&#8201;e&#8722; Oxygen Reduction Reaction: A Never&#8208;Ending Story?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exohedral functionalization of carbon nanomaterials with tailored O&#8208;containing groups appears as the long&#8208;sought solution for putting an end to a highly controversial matter within the scientific community: shedding light on the puzzling structure/reactivity relationship in metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for the challenging 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction.







Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electrosynthesis via the 2e&#8722; Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) represents a highly challenging, environmentally friendly and cost&#8208;effective alternative to the current anthraquinone&#8208;based technology. Various lightweight element hetero&#8208;doped carbon nanostructures are promising and cheap metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for H2O2 synthesis, particularly those containing O&#8208;functionalities. The exact role of O&#8208;containing functional groups as electroactive sites for the process remains debated if not highly controversial. Herein, we have reported on the covalent exohedral functionalization of the outer surface of extra&#8208;pure multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with discrete O&#8208;functional groups as a unique approach to prepare selective electrocatalysts for the process. This kind of decoration has added fundamental tiles to the puzzling structure/reactivity relationship of O&#8208;containing carbon&#8208;based catalysts for ORR, clearing doubts on the controversial role of hydroxyl/phenol groups as key functionalities for the design of more performing 2e&#8722; ORR electrocatalysts.

         <title>Dipole&#8208;Transmissive 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloadditions for the Rapid Construction of Polycyclic N&#8208;Heterocycles: Synthetic and Mechanistic Investigations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigation into and formalisation of dipole&#8208;transmissive dipolar cycloaddition (DTDC) methodology is reported. By designing substrates bearing complementary azide and diazoalkane 1,3&#8208;dipoles, we were able to employ integrated experimental and theoretical studies to construct a series of polycyclic N&#8208;heterocycles and rationalise the mechanistic basis of the divergent reactivity observed.







Abstract
The investigation of distinctive dipole&#8208;transmissive dipolar cycloaddition (DTDC) methodology and the formalisation of this concept is reported. A DTDC procedure was able to be developed by taking advantage of the structural complementarity of azide and diazoalkane 1,3&#8208;dipoles. Intramolecular azide&#8208;alkene 1,3&#8208;DCs followed by spontaneous dipole transmission upon work&#8208;up furnished intermediate &#945;&#8208;diazoisoindole and &#945;&#8208;diazoisoquinoline substrates bearing the key secondary diazoalkane 1,3&#8208;dipole. N&#8208;Derivatisation of the intermediate &#945;&#8208;diazoisoindole and &#945;&#8208;diazoisoquinolines with a tethered secondary dipolarophile followed by a subsequent 1,3&#8208;DC allowed for rapid construction of a range of functionalised polycyclic N&#8208;heterocycles. Integrated experimental and theoretical studies established requirements for product formation and revealed the likely mechanistic basis of divergent reactivity observed.

Abstract
A series of thienoindolizine structural isomers have been synthesized in a one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step procedure starting from easily accessible gem&#8208;difluoroalkene functionalized bromothiophenes. The developed method gives easy access to a range of thienoindolizine products containing thieno[3,2&#8208;g]&#8208;, thieno[3,4&#8208;g]&#8208; and thieno[2,3&#8208;g]indolizine core structures. The described synthesis strategy consists of a base mediated, transition metal free nucleophilic substitution of fluorine atoms by nitrogen containing heterocycles followed by a Pd catalyzed intramolecular cyclization. A series of 22 final product examples has been obtained with yields ranging from 29&#8201;% to 95&#8201;%. UV/Vis absorption, fluorescence spectroscopy, fluorescence lifetime measurements and cyclic voltammetry were carried out with selected final products to evaluate structural effects on photophysical and electrochemical properties. (TD)DFT and NICS calculations were performed to provide insight into the electronic properties of the four core molecular structures.

         <title>In Situ Generation of Magnesium&#8208; and Calcium&#8208;Based Grignard Reagents for Amide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amides of magnesium are widely used reagents whereas the calcium congeners remained unappreciated for diverse reasons such as inertness of the metal and side reactions during Grignard&#8208;type applications. Intermediately prepared aryl&#8208; and alkylcalcium reagents, which are immediately consumed via metalation of amines (iGMM) or addition across imines (iGAM) circumvent many difficulties related to organocalcium chemistry.







Abstract
The alkaline&#8208;earth metals Mg and Ca are too inert for the direct metalation of primary and secondary amines. Consequently, activation prior to use is required. Alternatively, the Grignard reagents RMgX (R=alkyl, aryl, X=halide) can be applied in metalation of amines. However, such a straightforward procedure for the synthesis of alkylcalcium reagents is disadvantageous due to diverse side reactions, including Wurtz&#8208;type C&#8722;C coupling and ether degradation reactions. Therefore, suspensions of magnesium or calcium with amine can be treated in a smooth reaction with ethyl bromide in an ethereal solvent at room temperature. Intermediately formed RAeX (Ae=alkaline&#8208;earth metal, i.&#8201;e., Mg, Ca) either metalates amines yielding the corresponding amides in an in&#8197;situ Grignard metalation method (iGMM) or adds across C=N bonds of imines in an in&#8197;situ Grignard addition method (iGAM). The amides R&#8217;2N&#8208;AeX (Ae=Mg: Hauser bases) undergo Schlenk&#8208;type ligand exchange reactions yielding homoleptic Ae(NR&#8217;2)2 and potentially sparingly soluble AeX2.

The amides R&#8217;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N-AeX (Ae=Mg: &lt;i&gt;Hauser&lt;/i&gt; bases) undergo &lt;i&gt;Schlenk&lt;/i&gt;-type ligand exchange reactions yielding homoleptic Ae(NR&#8217;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and potentially sparingly soluble AeX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Shape&#8208;Morphing Liquid&#8208;Crystal polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shaping up: Liquid&#8208;crystal polymers are considered one of the most promising candidates for intelligent shape&#8208;morphing materials. In this review, we discuss recent developments in energy conversion, design strategies and the applications of shape&#8208;morphing liquid&#8208;crystal polymers.







Abstract
Liquid&#8208;crystal polymers are a type of representative material combining the order&#8208;disorder transition of liquid crystals and the superior properties of polymers. The phase transition from the liquid&#8208;crystal phase to the isotropic state of mesogens causes large, controllable, and reversible deformation of polymers; thus, liquid&#8208;crystal polymers have emerged as one of the most valuable candidates for shape&#8208;morphing materials. Therefore, this review will focus on the recent development of shape&#8208;morphing liquid&#8208;crystal polymers, including the modes of energy conversions, material design strategies and further applications. In the main, novel material design methods and a wide range of application of shape&#8208;morphing liquid&#8208;crystal polymers are discussed.

         <title>Synthesis of a Benzotrisazulene via Trioxobenzotrisazulene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A benzotrisazulene was synthesized on the basis of a truxene precursor by a series of Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura reactions via the intermediate trisoxo compound. The latter occurs in two forms (syn and anti), and the syn forms porous crystals.







Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) containing odd&#8208;membered rings (such as pentagons or heptagons) are fascinating synthetic targets. A special case is the introduction of five&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered rings in form of an azulene unit. Azulene itself is an aromatic compounds known for its deep blue color, which is a result of its internal dipole moment. When azulene is embedded into PAHs it can change the optoelectronic properties of the PAH significantly. Herein, the synthesis and characterization of a PAH containing three azulene units is reported via reduction and elimination of its trioxo derivative.

         <title>Generation and Characterization of a Tetraradical Embedded in a Curved Cyclic Paraphenylene Unit</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetraradical embedded in a curved cycloparaphenylene skeleton was generated and characterized to examine the reactivity and magnetic interaction of the two diradical units in the bent molecular structure. Ferromagnetic interactions within the diradical unit and antiferromagnetic interaction between the diradical units lead to an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state for the tetraradical.







Abstract
Unique spin&#8211;spin (magnetic) interactions, ring&#8208;size effects on ground&#8208;state spin multiplicity, and in&#8208;plane aromaticity has been found in localized 1,3&#8208;diradicals embedded in curved benzene structures such as cycloparaphenylene (CPP). In this study, we characterized the magnetic interactions in a tetraradical consisting of two localized 1,3&#8208;diradical units connected by p&#8208;quaterphenyl within a curved CPP skeleton by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. Persistent triplet species with zero&#8208;field splitting parameters similar to those of a triplet 1,3&#8208;diphenylcyclopentane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyl diradical were observed by continuous wave (CW) or pulsed X&#8208;band EPR measurements. The quintet state derived from the ferromagnetic interaction between the two triplet diradical moieties was not detected at 20&#8197;K under glassy matrix conditions. At the B3LYP/6&#8208;31G(d) level of theory, the singlet state was lower in energy than the triplet and quintet states. These findings will aid in the development of open&#8208;shell species for material science application.

         <title>Micelle&#8208;Mediated Sonogashira Coupling for DNA&#8208;Encoded Library Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A micelle&#8208;mediated Sonogashira reaction between on&#8208;DNA (hetero)aryl iodides or bromides and (hetero)aryl or aliphatic terminal alkynes. The methodology shows broad substrate scope in terms of both coupling partners and we demonstrate that the methodology is fully compatible with library synthesis protocols and DNA encoded and decoding. This methodology will enable the synthesis of alkynyl(hetero)biaryls or it could be used for subsequent derivatization to alternative products, such as the corresponding alkane or heterocycles.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;Encoded Libraries (DELs) are becoming widely established as a hit identification strategy for drug discovery campaigns. Their successful application relies on the availability and efficiency of the reactions that can be carried out on DNA. These reactions should proceed with high conversion to the desired product and have a broad substrate scope to synthesise chemically diverse and drug&#8208;like DELs. The Sonogashira coupling provides a unique means of coupling an sp&#8208;hybridized carbon centre to an aryl halide and methods to achieve this reaction on DNA are highly desirable. We report the application of our micellar technology for on&#8208;DNA chemistry to the Sonogashira reaction. This method gives highly efficient conversions for the coupling of (hetero)aromatic and aliphatic alkynes to (hetero)aryl iodides and bromides allowing the preparation of highly diverse DELs.

         <title>Highly Chemoselective Zn+2&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrosilylation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new dicationic Zn&#8208;based complex was synthesized and found to be a highly selective catalyst for the hydrosilylation of alkynes. Remarkably, this complex could selectively catalyze the hydrosilylation of alkynes even in the presence of alkenes.







Abstract
Hydrosilylation of C=C double and C&#8801;C triple bonds is one of the most widely used processes in organosilicon chemistry, mostly catalyzed by Pt&#8208;based complexes. Herein, the synthesis of a dicationic Zn+2&#8208;based complex with a tripodal tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine (TPA) ligand is reported which was found to be a highly chemoselective catalyst for hydrosilylation reactions of alkynes. Mechanistic studies revealed that unlike typical Zn&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation reactions where the key step is the activation of the Si&#8722;H bond, this system catalyzes the hydrosilylation reaction through the activation of C&#8801;C triple bonds, which presumably is the reason for its high chemoselectivity. Remarkably, the hydrosilylation of alkynes could be performed in the presence of alkenes and other functional groups that remained intact in this reaction.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing torsion balance molecules, we effectively measured the magnitude of the dispersion forces involved in the non&#8208;covalent interactions between substituted arene and fullerene. In addition, our findings indicate that solvation is of paramount importance in the anionic arene&#8211;fullerene interaction between thiophenolate and fullerene.







Abstract
We employ a molecular torsion balance displaying bifurcated conformational isomerism to quantitatively evaluate the non&#8208;covalent interactions between the fullerene surface and substituted arene moieties containing elements with high atomic numbers, as well as the thermodynamic processes involved in the folding equilibrium using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The interaction between fullerene and haloaryl groups was stronger in cases where the introduced halogen had a higher atomic number, indicating that dispersion forces play a significant role in the interaction between fullerenes and 4&#8208;haloaryl groups. The dispersion term also significantly contributed to the interaction between fullerene and the 4&#8208;mercaptophenyl group. Moreover, the addition of an appropriate base to the 4&#8208;mercaptophenyl&#8208;appended torsion balance formed the corresponding thiophenolate anion, resulting in a large negative change in the folding free energy in CDCl3. Detailed analysis suggested that the observed attractive anionic arene&#8211;fullerene interactions predominantly originated from solvation effects.

         <title>Molecular Editing Enhances Oxidation Resistance of Mena&#8208;quinone&#8208;Targeting Antibiotics Lysocin E and WAP&#8208;8294A2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lysocin E (1a) and WAP&#8208;8294A2 (2a) are peptidic natural products with 37&#8208; and 40&#8208;membered macrocycles, respectively. Compounds 1a and 2a have potent antibacterial activities against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria and share a unique mode of action. The electron&#8208;rich indole ring of d&#8208;Trp&#8208;10 of 1a and 2a interacts with the electron&#8208;deficient benzoquinone ring of menaquinone, which is a co&#8208;enzyme in the bacterial respiratory chain. Formation of the electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor complex causes membrane disruption, leading to cell death. Despite the promising activities of 1a and 2a, the susceptibility of Trp&#8208;10 to oxidative degradation potentially deters the development of these compounds as antibacterial drugs. To address this issue, we replaced the indole ring with more oxidation&#8208;resistant aromatics having a similar shape and electron&#8208;rich character. Specifically, analogues with benzofuran (1b/2b), benzothiophene (1c/2c), and 1&#8208;naphthalene (1d/2d) rings were designed, and chemically prepared by full solid&#8208;phase total syntheses. Antibacterial assays of the six analogues revealed similar activities of 1d/2d and markedly reduced activities of 1b/2b and 1c/2c compared with 1a/2a. Equipotent 1d and 2d both showed high resistance to oxidation by peroxyl radicals. Hence, the present study demonstrates a new molecular editing strategy for conferring oxidation stability on natural products with pharmacologically useful functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Shape Transformation via Etching and Regrowth: A Systematic Study of Pd Nanocrystals with Different Shapes and Twin Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This article describes a systematic study of the oxidative etching and regrowth behaviors of Pd nanocrystals, including single&#8208;crystal cubes bounded by {100} facets,&#160;single&#8208;crystal&#160;octahedra and tetrahedra enclosed by {111} facets; and multiple&#8208;twinned icosahedra covered by {111} facets. During etching, Pd atoms are preferentially oxidized and removed from the corners regardless of the type of nanocrystal, and the resultant Pd2+ ions are then reduced back to elemental Pd. For cubes and icosahedra, the newly formed Pd atoms are deposited on the {100} facets and twin boundaries, respectively, due to their relatively higher energies. For octahedra and tetrahedra, the Pd atoms self&#8208;nucleate in the solution phase, followed by their growth into small particles. We can control the etching rate relative to regrowth by varying the concentration of HCl in the reaction solution. As the concentration of HCl increases, 18&#8208;nm Pd cubes converted to&#160;octahedra of 23, 18, and 13 nm, respectively, in edge length. Due to the absence of regrowth, however, Pd octahedra are transformed into truncated octahedra, cuboctahedra, and spheres with decreasing sizes whereas Pd tetrahedra evolved into truncated tetrahedra and spheres. In contrast, Pd icosahedra with twin boundaries on the surface converted to asymmetric icosahedra, flower&#8208;like icosahedra, and spheres.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Visible Light Photocatalysis with Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>

This review summarized the latest advances in the field of cooperative catalysis by the combination of organocatalysis and photocatalysis in recent organic synthesis.







Abstract
In recent years, the strategy of merging visible light photocatalysis and organocatalysis has been utilized and applied in a wide range of reactions. Taking advantage of synergistic visible light photocatalysis with organocatalysis, remarkable progress has recently been achieved in modern chemical synthesis. In these dual catalytic systems, photocatalysts or photosensitizers absorb visible light to induce their photo&#8208;excited states which can activate unreactive substrates via electron or energy transfer mechanisms, and organocatalysts are usually employed to control the chemical reactivities of the other substrates. This review mainly focuses on the recent development of cooperative catalysis by the combination of organocatalysis and photocatalysis in recent organic synthesis.

         <title>Mono&#8208; and Difluorinated Saturated Heterocyclic Amines for Drug Discovery: Systematic Study of Their Physicochemical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A comprehensive study of physicochemical properties (pKa, LogP, and intrinsic microsomal clearance) within the series of mono&#8208; and difluorinated azetidine, pyrrolidine, and piperidine derivatives was performed. While the number of fluorine atoms and their distance to the protonation center were the major factors defining the compound&#8217;s basicity, both pKa and LogP values were affected considerably by the conformational preferences of the corresponding derivatives. For example, features of &#8220;Janus face&#8221; (facially polarized) cyclic compounds (i.e., unusually high hydrophilicity) were identified for cis&#8208;3,5&#8208;difluoropiperidine, prefering a diaxial conformation. Intrinsic microsomal clearance measurements demonstrated high metabolic stability of the compounds studied (with a single exception of the 3,3&#8208;difluoroazetidine derivative). According to pKa &#8211; LogP plots, the title compounds provide a valuable extension of the fluorine&#8208;containing (e.g., fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted) saturated heterocyclic amine series as building blocks for rational optimization studies in early drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Tropane Scaffolds by an Organocatalyzed 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition of 3&#8208;Oxidopyridinium Betaines and Dienamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tropane alkaloids constitute a compound&#8208;class which are structurally defined by a central 8&#8209;azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane core. A diverse bioactivity profile combined with an unusual aza&#8208;bridged bicyclic framework has made tropanes molecules&#8208;of&#8208;interest within organic chemistry. Enantioselective examples of (5 + 2) cycloadditions between 3&#8208;oxidopyridinium betaines and olefins remain unexplored, despite 3&#8208;oxidopyridinium betaines being useful reagents in organic synthesis. We report the first asymmetric (5 + 2) cycloaddition of 3&#8208;oxidopyridinium betaines, affording tropane derivatives in up to quantitative yield and with excellent control of peri&#8208;, regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivity. The reactivity is enabled by dienamine&#8208;activation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes combined with in&#8208;situ formation of the pyridinium reaction&#8208;partner. A simple N&#8208;deprotection protocol allows for liberation of the tropane alkaloid motif, and synthetic elaborations of the cycloadducts demonstrate their synthetic utility to achieve highly diastereoselective modification around the bicyclic framework. DFT computations suggest a stepwise mechanism where regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity are defined during the first bond&#8208;forming step in which the pyridinium dipole exerts critical conformational control over its dienamine partner. In the second bond&#8208;forming step, a kinetic preference toward an initial (5 + 4) cycloadduct was identified; however, lack of catalyst turn&#8208;over, reversibility, and thermodynamic bias favoring a (5 + 2) cycloadduct render the reaction fully periselective.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, a new tellurium and mercury containing mercuraazametallamacrocycle has been prepared via (2+2) condensation of bis(o&#8208;aminophenyl)telluride and bis(o&#8208;formylphenyl)mercury(II). The isolated bright yellow solid of mercuraazametallamacrocycle has adopted unsymmetrical figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight conformation in the crystal structure. To study the metallophilic interactions between closed shell metal ions, the macrocyclic ligand has been treated with two equiv of AgOTf (OTf = trifluoromethansulfonate) and AgBF4, which afforded greenish&#8208;yellow bimetallic silver complexes. The isolated silver complexes displayed intramolecular Hg&#183;&#183;&#183;Ag, Te&#183;&#183;&#183;Ag interactions as well as intermolecular Hg&#183;&#183;&#183;Hg interactions and formed an extended 1D molecular chain by directing six atoms to interact as TeII&#183;&#183;&#183;AgI&#183;&#183;&#183;HgII&#183;&#183;&#183;HgII&#183;&#183;&#183;AgI&#183;&#183;&#183;TeII in a non linear fashion. The Hg&#183;&#183;&#183;Ag, Te&#183;&#183;&#183;Ag interactions have also been studied in solution by 199Hg, 125Te NMR spectroscopy, absorption, and emission spectroscopy. In DFT calculations, the Atom in Molecule (AIM) analysis, non&#8208;covalent interactions (NCI), natural bonding orbital (NBO) analysis strongly supported for experimental evidences and revealed that the intermolecular Hg&#183;&#183;&#183;Hg interaction is stronger than the intramolecular Hg&#183;&#183;&#183;Ag interactions.</dc:description>

N&#8208;aryl amide bonds for peptide conformation: In the universe of peptides,theN&#8208;aryl amide bond, with its large steric and electronic effects and ability to restrain amide bond rotation, is represented as a new star. By employing N&#8208;arylation as a backbone amide modification strategy in peptides, we could unravel the different worlds of distinct and predominantly homogeneous conformations in cyclic hexa&#8208; and cyclic pentapeptides containing one or two N&#8208;aryl amide bonds.

         <title>Polymer&#8208;Stabilized Liquid Crystal Films Containing Dithienyldicyanoethene&#8208;Based Chiral Photoswitch: Multi&#8208;Modulation for Environment&#8208;Adaptative Smart Windows</title>

         <dc:description>
An environment&#8208;adaptative smart window with multi&#8208;modulations is constructed by a dithienyldicyanoethene&#8208;based chiral photoswitch. The smart window can be automatically transformed from initial transparent state to light scattering state with the changes of external ambient conditions, and can be manually switched between the opaque state and transparent state through a low electric field, which greatly satisfies the diverse requirements for daily life.







Abstract
A polymer&#8208;stabilized liquid crystal (PSLC)&#8208;based environment&#8208;adaptative smart window with multi&#8208;modulations is demonstrated. This PSLC system contains a right&#8208;handed dithienyldicyanoethene&#8208;based chiral photoswitch and a chiral dopant, S811, with opposite handedness, of which the reversible cis&#8208;trans photoisomerization of the switch can drive self&#8208;shading of the smart window under UV light stimulus because of the transition from nematic phase to cholesteric one. With the assistance of solar heat, the opacity of the smart window can be deepened because the heat promotes the isomerization conversion rate of the switch. This switch has no thermal relaxation at room temperature, therefore, the smart window exhibits dual stabilization: transparent state (cis&#8208;isomer) and opaque state (trans&#8208;isomer). Moreover, the incident intensity of sunlight can be regulated by an electric field, which allows the smart window to adapt to some specific situations. Such an energy&#8208;saving device can be used in buildings and vehicles to control indoor temperature and adapt to the required ambiance.

         <title>Sulfonyl Diazaborine &#8216;Click&#8217; Chemistry Enables Rapid and Efficient Bioorthogonal Labeling
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we have systematically developed and deliberated an efficient bioorthogonal reaction via the rapid formation of sulfonyl&#8208;diazaborine. The conjugation is robust to demonstrate suitable application in cancer cell imaging and treatment.







Abstract
Finding an ideal bioorthogonal reaction that responds to a wide range of biological queries and applications is of great interest in biomedical applications. Rapid diazaborine (DAB) formation in water by the reactions of ortho&#8208;carbonyl phenylboronic acid with &#945;&#8208;nucleophiles is an attractive conjugation module. Nevertheless, these conjugation reactions demand to satisfy stringent criteria for bioorthogonal applications. Here we show that widely used sulfonyl hydrazide (SHz) offers a stable DAB conjugate by combining with ortho&#8208;carbonyl phenylboronic acid at physiological pH, competent for an optimal biorthogonal reaction. Remarkably, the reaction conversion is quantitative and rapid (k2&gt;103&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) at low micromolar concentrations, and it preserves comparable efficacy in a complex biological milieu. DFT calculations support that SHz facilitates DAB formation via the most stable hydrazone intermediate and the lowest energy transition state compared to other biocompatible &#945;&#8208;nucleophiles. This conjugation is extremely efficient on living cell surfaces, enabling compelling pretargeted imaging and peptide delivery. We anticipate this work will permit addressing a wide range of cell biology queries and drug discovery platforms exploiting commercially available sulfonyl hydrazide fluorophores and derivatives.

&lt;p&gt;Here we have systematically developed and deliberated an efficient bioorthogonal reaction via the rapid formation of sulfonyl-diazaborine. The conjugation is robust to demonstrate suitable application in cancer cell imaging and treatment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding an ideal bioorthogonal reaction that responds to a wide range of biological queries and applications is of great interest in biomedical applications. Rapid diazaborine (DAB) formation in water by the reactions of ortho-carbonyl phenylboronic acid with &#945;-nucleophiles is an attractive conjugation module. Nevertheless, these conjugation reactions demand to satisfy stringent criteria for bioorthogonal applications. Here we show that widely used sulfonyl hydrazide (SHz) offers a stable DAB conjugate by combining with ortho-carbonyl phenylboronic acid at physiological pH, competent for an optimal biorthogonal reaction. Remarkably, the reaction conversion is quantitative and rapid (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;gt;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) at low micromolar concentrations, and it preserves comparable efficacy in a complex biological milieu. DFT calculations support that SHz facilitates DAB formation via the most stable hydrazone intermediate and the lowest energy transition state compared to other biocompatible &#945;-nucleophiles. This conjugation is extremely efficient on living cell surfaces, enabling compelling pretargeted imaging and peptide delivery. We anticipate this work will permit addressing a wide range of cell biology queries and drug discovery platforms exploiting commercially available sulfonyl hydrazide fluorophores and derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Blueprint for Transforming Indigos to Photoresponsive Molecular Tools</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The blue dye indigo has historically been isolated from the plant family Indigofera and widely applied in the denim industry for producing blue jeans. The advantageous photochemical properties of indigo and its derivatives have now attracted the attention of the scientific community for their use as molecular photoswitches. In their review Review (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300981), C.&#8208;Y. Huang and S. Hecht detail the synthetic approaches to preparing indigos and discuss indigos&#8217; applications as photoresponsive molecular tools.

         <title>Electronic and Charge Transport Properties in Bridged versus Unbridged Nanohoops: Role of the Nanohoop Size</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impact of the hoop size on the electronic and charge transport properties of [5]&#8208; and [4]&#8208;cyclo&#8208;N&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,7&#8208;carbazoles is reported. In these examples, a small nanohoop is beneficial for good organization of the molecules into thin films, whereas a large one increases the density of structural defects.

         <title>Structural Interconversion Based on Intramolecular Boroxine Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel structural interconversion unit based on intramolecular boroxine formation has been developed. The interconversion of a macrocyclic triboronic acid (blue Japanese umbrella) and a tricyclic boroxine (green pinwheel) can be triggered by water or temperature. These unique interconversions are attributed to the entropic advantage of intramolecular boroxine formation. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. Ono and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300995).

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Stachyurin and Casuarinin Focusing on C&#8208;Glycosidic Bond Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study developed a method for the divergent synthesis of stachyurin and casuarinin, focusing on the C&#8208;glycosidic bond reactivity. The proposed method applies to the syntheses of stachyurin and casuarinin analogues, thereby facilitating the utilization of their beneficial bioactivities.







Abstract
Stachyurin and casuarinin are ellagitannins, a class of polyphenols that exhibit various biological activities that have an impact on human health. Casuarinin is a stachyurin stereoisomer. These compounds contain the characteristic C&#8208;glycosidic bond between the open&#8208;chain d&#8208;glucose and the phenol aromatic ring. Therefore, chemical elucidation of the C&#8208;glycosidic bond reactivity is required to exploit their multiple bioactivities. This study developed a method for the divergent synthesis of stachyurin and casuarinin via the &#945;&#8208;selective C&#8208;glycosylation as well as the &#946;&#8208;selective introduction of the oxygen functional group, focusing on structural specificity. The proposed method applies to the syntheses of stachyurin and casuarinin analogues, thereby facilitating the utilisation of their beneficial bioactivities.

         <title>Persistent and Predominantly Localized Boron Radical from the Reduction of a Three&#8208;Dimensional Analogue of NHC&#8208;Stabilized Borafluorenium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A persistent and predominantly localized boron radical has been synthesized by the single&#8208;electron reduction of a 3D analogue of an NHC&#8208;stabilized 9&#8208;borafluorenium cation. The steric and electron&#8208;withdrawing effect of the 1,1&#8217;&#8208;bis(o&#8208;carborane) backbone and the almost perpendicular orientation of the NHC ligand give rise to the distinct boron&#8208;centered radical character, as evidenced by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, EPR spectroscopy, and DFT calculations. More information can be found in the Research Article by Q. Ye and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301270).

         <title>Metal&#8208;organic framework derived Cu&#8208;Ag interface for selective carbon monoxide electroreduction to acetate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical carbon monoxide reduction reaction (CORR) is a potential way to obtain high&#8208;value multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products. However, achieving high selectivity to acetate is still a challenge. Herein, we develop a two&#8208;dimensional Ag&#8208;modified Cu metal&#8208;organic framework (Ag0.10@CuMOF&#8208;74) that demonstrates Faradaic efficiency (FE) for C2+ products up to 90.4% at 200 mA cm&#8208;2 and an acetate FE of 61.1% with a partial current density of 122.2 mA cm&#8208;2. Detailed investigations show that the introduction of Ag on CuMOF&#8208;74 favors the generation of abundant Cu&#8208;Ag interface sites. In&#8208;situ attenuated total reflection surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy confirms that these Cu&#8208;Ag interface sites improve the coverage of *CO and *CHO and the coupling between each other and stabilize key intermediates *OCCHO and *OCCH2, thus significantly promoting to the acetate selectivity on Ag0.10@CuMOF&#8208;74. This work provides a high&#8208;efficiency pathway for CORR to C2+ products.</dc:description>

         <title>Design and Synthesis of BODIPY&#8208;Hetero[5]Helicenes as Heavy&#8208;Atom&#8208;Free&#160;Triplet Photosensitizers for Photodynamic Therapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Design of heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free triplet photosensitizers (PSs) is a challenge for efficient photodynamic therapy (PDT) of cancer. Helicenes are twisted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) having efficient ISC which is proportional to their twisting angle. But difficult syntheses and weak absorption profile restrict their use as heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free triplet PSs for PDT applications. Boron containing PAHs, BODIPYs are highly recognized for outstanding optical properties. But planar BODIPY dyes have&#160;low ISC and thus they are also not very effective as PDT agents. Herein, we designed BODIPY and hetero[5]helicene fused dyes, BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicene&#160;with red shifted absorbances. All dyes have helical structures and their twisting angles are increased by substitutions at boron&#8208;center. The new dyes showed superior optical properties and high ISC with respect to [5]helicene. Interestingly their ISC efficiencies increase proportionally with their twisting angles. Theoretical calculations showed that energy gap of the S1 and T1 states decreases in BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicene as compared to planar BODIPY. This enhances their ISC rate which is responsible for high singlet oxygen generation. Finally, their potential applications as PDT agents were investigated and one of the dyes showed efficient cancer cell killing on photo&#8208;exposure. This new design strategy will be very useful for future development of heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free PDT agents.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA Windmill Probe for Multiplexed mRNA Detection and Cell Type Discrimination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Accurate cancer diagnosis especially early diagnosis is of great importance for prompt therapy and elevated survival rate. mRNAs are widely used as biomarkers for cancer identification and treatment. mRNA expression levels are highly associated with cancer stage and malignant progression. Nevertheless, single type mRNA detection is insufficient and unreliable. Herein, we developed a DNA nano&#8208;windmill probe for in situ multiplexed mRNAs detection and imaging in this paper. The probe is designed to simultaneously target four types of mRNA through wind blades. Importantly, recognition of targets is independent from each other, which further facilitate cell type discrimination. The probe can specifically distinguish cancer cell lines from normal cells. In addition, it can identify changes in mRNA expression levels in living cells. The current strategy enriches the toolbox for improving the accuracy of cancer diagnosis and therapeutic solutions.</dc:description>

         <title>The Factor Beyond Schmidt's Criteria That Impact the Photo&#8208;Induced [2+2] Cycloaddition Reactivity and Photoactuation of Molecular Crystals Based on Cyclic Chalcone Analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cyclic chalcone analogues of (E)&#8208;2&#8208;(2,4&#8208;dichlorobenzylidene)&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;inden&#8208;1&#8208;one (BIO), (E)&#8208;2&#8208;(naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethylene)&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;inden&#8208;1&#8208;one (NIO), (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;(2,4&#8208;dichlorobenzylidene)benzofuran&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;one (BFO), and (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;(2,4&#8208;dichlorobenzylidene)benzo[b]thiophen&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;one (BTO) have been synthesized. While the geometrical parameters for the molecular packing of the above four compounds did not exceed Schmidt's criteria, [2+2] cycloaddition did not occur in&#160;&#160;BIO and BTO. Single crystal structures and Hirshfeld surfaces analyses revealed that there were interactions of C=O&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;H (CH2) existed between adjacent molecules in BIO. Therefore, the carbonyl and methylene groups linked with one carbon atom in carbon&#8208;carbon double bond were tightly confined in the lattice, acting as a tweezer to inhibit free movement of the double bond and suppressing [2+2] cycloaddition. In BTO, similar interactions of Cl&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;S and C=O&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;H (C6H4) prevented free movement of the double bond. In contrast, the intermolecular interaction of C=O&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;H only exists around the carbonyl group in BFO and NIO, leaving the C=C double bonds to move freely and allowing the occurrence of [2+2] cycloaddition. Driven by photodimerization, the needle&#8208;like crystals of BFO and NIO displayed evident photo&#8208;induced bending behavior. This work demonstrates that the intermolecular interactions around carbon&#8208;carbon double bond would affect the [2+2] cycloaddition reactivity except for Schmidt&#8217;s criteria. These findings provide valuable insights into the design of photomechanical molecular crystalline materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphorus Dendrimers for Metal&#8208;Free Ligation: Design of Multivalent Pharmacological Chaperones against Gaucher Disease</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first phosphorus dendrimers built on a cyclotriphosphazene core and decorated with six or twelve monofluorocyclooctyne units were prepared. A simple stirring allowed the grafting of N&#8208;hexyl deoxynojirimycin inhitopes onto their surface by copper&#8211;free strain promoted alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition click reaction. The synthesized iminosugars clusters were tested as multivalent inhibitors of the biologically relevant enzymes &#946;&#8208;glucocerebrosidase and acid &#945;&#8208;glucosidase, involved in Gaucher and Pompe lysosomal storage diseases, respectively. For both enzymes, all the multivalent compounds were more potent than the reference N&#8208;hexyl deoxynojirimycin. Remarkably, final dodecavalent compound proved to be one of the best &#946;&#8208;glucocerebrosidase inhibitors described to date. These cyclotriphosphazene&#8208;based deoxynojirimycin dendrimers were then evaluated as pharmacological chaperones against Gaucher disease. Not only did these multivalent constructs cross the cell membranes but they were also able to increase &#946;&#8208;glucocerebrosidase activity in Gaucher cells. Notably, dodecavalent compound allowed a 1.4&#8208;fold enzyme activity enhancement at a concentration as low as 100 nM. These new monofluorocyclooctyne&#8208;presenting dendrimers may further find numerous applications in the synthesis of multivalent objects for biological and pharmacological purposes.</dc:description>

         <title>Next Generation of Fluorometric Protease Assays: 7&#8208;Nitrobenz&#8208;2&#8208;oxa&#8208;1,3&#8208;diazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl&#8208;amides (NBD&#8208;Amides) as Class&#8208;Spanning Protease Substrates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorometric assays are one of the most frequently used methods in medicinal chemistry. Over the last 50 years, the reporter molecules for the detection of protease activity have evolved from first&#8208;generation colorimetric p&#8208;nitroanilides, through FRET substrates, and 7&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;methyl coumarin (AMC)&#8208;based substrates. The aim of further substrate development is to increase sensitivity and reduce vulnerability to assay interferences. Here, we describe a new generation of substrates for protease assays based on 7&#8208;nitrobenz&#8208;2&#8208;oxa&#8208;1,3&#8208;diazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl&#8208;amides (NBD&#8208;amides). In this study, we synthesized and tested substrates for 10 different proteases from the serine&#8208;, cysteine&#8208;, and metalloprotease classes. Enzyme&#8208; and substrate&#8208;specific parameters as well as the inhibitory activity of literature&#8208;known inhibitors confirmed their suitability for application in fluorometric assays. Hence, we were able to present NBD&#8208;based alternatives for common protease substrates. In conclusion, these NBD substrates are not only less susceptible to common assay interference, but they are also able to replace FRET&#8208;based substrates with the requirement of a prime site amino acid residue.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fluorometric assays are one of the most frequently used methods in medicinal chemistry. Over the last 50 years, the reporter molecules for the detection of protease activity have evolved from first-generation colorimetric p-nitroanilides, through FRET substrates, and 7-amino-4-methyl coumarin (AMC)-based substrates. The aim of further substrate development is to increase sensitivity and reduce vulnerability to assay interferences. Here, we describe a new generation of substrates for protease assays based on 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl-amides (NBD-amides). In this study, we synthesized and tested substrates for 10 different proteases from the serine-, cysteine-, and metalloprotease classes. Enzyme- and substrate-specific parameters as well as the inhibitory activity of literature-known inhibitors confirmed their suitability for application in fluorometric assays. Hence, we were able to present NBD-based alternatives for common protease substrates. In conclusion, these NBD substrates are not only less susceptible to common assay interference, but they are also able to replace FRET-based substrates with the requirement of a prime site amino acid residue.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Double Dynamic Structural Change Enabling Tricolor Chromism by the Realization of Apparent Two&#8208;electron Transfer to Skip the Open&#8208;shell State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Most redox systems generally cannot avoid the involvement of open&#8208;shell species upon generating multiply charged species, which often reduces reversibility in multi&#8208;color electrochromic systems. In this study, we newly synthesized octakis(aminophenyl)substituted pentacenebisquinodimethane (BQD) derivatives and their hybrids with alkoxyphenyl analogues. Thanks to apparent twoelectron transfer accompanied by double dramatic changes in the structure of the arylated quinodimethane skeleton, the dicationic and tetracationic states were generated and isolated quantitatively because of the negligible steady&#8208;state concentration of intermediary open&#8208;shell species such as monocation or trication radicals. When two electrophores with different donating abilities are attached to the BQD skeleton, a dicationic state with a different color can be isolated in addition to the neutral and tetracationic states. For the latter of these, an interchromophore interaction induces a red&#8208;shift of the NIR absorptions, thus realizing tricolor UV/Vis/NIR electrochromic behavior involving only closed&#8208;shell states.</dc:description>

         <title>Superionic Conductivity in Sodium Zirconium Chloride&#8208;Based Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries are attracting intensive attention. Chloride&#8208;based solid electrolytes are promising candidates for use in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries because of their high chemical stability and low Young's modulus. Here, we report new superionic conductors based on polyanion&#8208;added chloride&#8208;based materials. Na0.67Zr(SO4)0.33Cl4 showed a high ionic conductivity of 1.6 mS cm&#8722;1 at room temperature. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis indicated that the highly conducting materials are mainly a mixture of an amorphous phase and Na2ZrCl6. The conductivity might be dominated by the electronegativity of the central atom of the polyanion. Electrochemical measurements reveal that Na0.67Zr(SO4)0.33Cl4 is a sodium ionic conductor and is suitable for use as a solid electrolyte in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Intrinsically Switchable Electroactive Fluorophores Based on &#955;5&#8208;Biphosphinines
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of &#955;5&#8208;biphosphinines is reported. &#955;5&#8208;Biphosphinines directly connected through a C&#8722;C bond in 4,4&#8208;position display two reversible oxidations highlighting their multi&#8208;stage redox character. In situ formed radicals are studied. Electrofluorochromism experiments revealed the potential of these intrinsically switchable electroactive fluorophores for applications as switchable materials.







Abstract
The synthesis and full characterization of a family of stable &#955;5&#8208;biphosphinines connected in 4,4&#8208;position through a variety of &#960;&#8208;conjugated bridges is reported. The impact of the &#960;&#8208;bridge on the optical (absorption/emission) and redox properties was investigated using a joint experimental/theoretical approach. In contrast to the &#960;&#8208;extended ones, the &#955;5&#8208;biphosphinines directly connected through a C&#8722;C bond in 4,4&#8208;position display two easily accessible and reversible oxidations highlighting their multi&#8208;stage redox character. The in&#8197;situ formed radical cations are studied by spectro&#8208;electrochemistry and electron paramagnetic resonance. Finally, electrochemical modulation of fluorescence (electrofluorochromism) was performed and revealed the potential of these intrinsically switchable electroactive fluorophores for further applications as switchable materials.

         <title>A Novel Nitridoborate Hydride Sr13[BN2]6H8 Elucidated from X&#8208;ray and Neutron Diffraction Data</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strontium nitridoborate hydride was prepared in a solid&#8208;state synthesis at 950&#8201;&#176;C and extends the little&#8208;known family of nitridoborate hydrides. The crystal structure was elucidated from single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray and neutron powder diffraction data. MAS&#8197;NMR, FTIR and Raman spectroscopy support the structure model and the presence of anionic hydrogen. Quantum chemical calculations provide insight into the electronic structure.







Abstract
Metal hydrides are an uprising compound class bringing up various functional materials. Due to the low X&#8208;ray scattering power of hydrogen, neutron diffraction is often crucial to fully disclose the structural characteristics thereof. We herein present the second strontium nitridoborate hydride known so far, Sr13[BN2]6H8, formed in a solid&#8208;state reaction of the binary nitrides and strontium hydride at 950&#8201;&#176;C. The crystal structure was elucidated based on single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray and neutron powder diffraction in the hexagonal space group P63/m (no.&#8197;176), exhibiting a novel three&#8208;dimensional network of [BN2]3&#8722; units and hydride anions connected by strontium cations. Further analyses with magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR and vibrational spectroscopy corroborate the presence of anionic hydrogen within the structure. Quantum chemical calculations reveal the electronic properties and support the experimental outcome. Sr13[BN2]6H8 expands the emerging family of nitridoborate hydrides, broadening the access to an open field of new, intriguing materials.

         <title>Bora&#172;alkene s: Metal Coordination and Reactions with BH&#8208;boranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The neutral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene stabilized, &#8722;N=C=S substituted bora&#172;alkene was used as a &#960; ligand in transition metal complexes. Due to the C&#8208;nucleophilic nature of the bora&#172;alkene, it underwent regioselective hydroboration reactions with the boranes (C6F5)2BH or C6F5BH2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;SMe2. The latter reaction showed a subsequent hydride vs. isothiocyanate substituent exchange.







Abstract
The neutral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene stabilized bora&#172;alkene 1, conveniently prepared by a BH borenium/hydroboration route, forms stable copper, gold or palladium &#960;&#8208;complexes. The polar bora&#172;alkene B=C system undergoes regioselective hydroboration reactions with the (C6F5)2BH or C6F5BH2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;SMe2 boranes. The latter reaction involves a subsequent rearrangement that leads to internal hydride vs. isothiocyanate substituent exchange at the borane pair.

The polar bora&#172;alkene B=C system undergoes regioselective hydroboration reactions with the (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BH or C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;BH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;SMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; boranes. The latter reaction involves a subsequent rearrangement that leads to internal hydride vs. isothiocyanate substituent exchange at the borane pair.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Stapled peptides: The development of an i, i+7 diyne&#8208;girder stapling strategy that produces &#945;&#8208;helical, protease stable, cell permeable and Raman active stapled peptides.







Abstract
Stapled peptides are a unique class of cyclic &#945;&#8208;helical peptides that are conformationally constrained via their amino acid side&#8208;chains. They have been transformative to the field of chemical biology and peptide drug discovery through addressing many of the physicochemical limitations of linear peptides. However, there are several issues with current chemical strategies to produce stapled peptides. For example, two distinct unnatural amino acids are required to synthesize i, i+7 alkene stapled peptides, leading to high production costs. Furthermore, low purified yields are obtained due to cis/trans isomers produced during ring&#8208;closing metathesis macrocyclisation. Here we report the development of a new i, i+7 diyne&#8208;girder stapling strategy that addresses these issues. The asymmetric synthesis of nine unnatural Fmoc&#8208;protected alkyne&#8208;amino acids facilitated a systematic study to determine the optimal (S,S)&#8208;stereochemistry and 14&#8208;carbon diyne&#8208;girder bridge length. Diyne&#8208;girder stapled T&#8208;STAR peptide 29 was demonstrated to have excellent helicity, cell permeability and stability to protease degradation. Finally, we demonstrate that the diyne&#8208;girder constraint is a Raman chromophore with potential use in Raman cell microscopy. Development of this highly effective, bifunctional diyne&#8208;girder stapling strategy leads us to believe that it can be used to produce other stapled peptide probes and therapeutics.

         <title>Selective Nsp2&#8208; and Csp2&#8208; Photografting of Au&#8208;Surface by Aryldiazonium Salts and Arylazo Sulfonates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photografting of azosulfates Ar&#8722;N=NSO3Na on gold, leads to bonded organic films. Au&#8722;R or Au&#8722;N=N&#8722;R bonding results from a stepwise or concerted reaction respectively. Azosulfonates are shelf stable compounds which are much easier to handle with respect to the commonaryldiazonium salt.







Abstract
Arylazo sulfonates (Ar&#8722;N=N&#8722;SO3Na) have been found to undergo photografting on gold surface through both Au&#8722;Nsp2&#8722; and Au&#8722;Csp2&#8722; bond formation. The functionalized materials have been fully characterized by infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS), Raman, XPS, DFT calculations and UV&#8208;Vis absorption spectroscopy. These methods permit to evidence aromatic substituents (IRRAS), the Au&#8722;N=N signature (Raman and XPS spectroscopy), and the bond dissociation energy values of the two linkages (DFT calculation). The grafting proceeds through two competitive paths, namely a stepwise reaction involving an aryl radical (for the formation of the Au&#8722;Ar bonds) and a concerted reaction on the surface of gold (for Au&#8722;N=N&#8722;Ar bond formation). The occurrence of an aryl radical upon irradiation has been fully evidenced by EPR spectroscopy. Finally, E/Z photoisomerisation of the N=N bonds present on prepared few layer films has been observed by means of UV&#8208;Vis absorption spectroscopy.

         <title>From Framework to Layers Driven by Pressure &#8211; The Monophyllo&#8208;Oxonitridophosphate &#946;&#8208;MgSrP3N5O2 and Comparison to its &#945;&#8208;Polymorph</title>

         <dc:description>
With the discovery of &#946;&#8208;MgSrP3N5O2:Eu2+, an oxonitridophosphate with outstanding luminescence properties is presented. Structural comparison of the &#945;&#8208;phase already known from the literature with other classes of compounds allowed a possible basic structure to be predicted, which was confirmed experimentally. This approach could be applied to other (oxo)nitridophosphates known in the literature, leading to the discovery of additional host lattices for possible luminescent properties.







Abstract
Oxonitridophosphates exhibit the potential for broad structural diversity, making them promising host&#8208;compounds in phosphor&#8208;converted light&#8208;emitting diode applications. The novel monophyllo&#8208;oxonitridophosphate &#946;&#8208;MgSrP3N5O2 was obtained by using the high&#8208;pressure multianvil technique. The crystal structure was solved and refined based on single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data and confirmed by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction. &#946;&#8208;MgSrP3N5O2 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Cmme (no. 67, a=8.8109(6), b=12.8096(6), c=4.9065(3) &#197;, Z=4) and has a structure related to that of Ba2CuSi2O7. DFT calculations were performed to investigate the phase transition from &#945;&#8208; to &#946;&#8208;MgSrP3N5O2 and to confirm the latter as the corresponding high&#8208;pressure polymorph. Furthermore, the luminescence properties of Eu2+ doped samples of both polymorphs were investigated and discussed, showing blue and cyan emission, respectively (&#945;&#8208;MgSrP3N5O2; &#955;max=438&#8197;nm, fwhm=46&#8197;nm/2396&#8197;cm&#8722;1; &#946;&#8208;MgSrP3N5O2; &#955;max=502&#8197;nm, fwhm=42&#8197;nm/1670&#8197;cm&#8722;1).

         <title>Balanced Energy Gaps as a Key Design Rule for Solution&#8208;Phase Organic Room Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solution&#8208;phase room temperature phosphorescence is very rare in all&#8208;organic emitters. Here we show how this property can emerge as a function of energy gaps between the phosphorescent state and higher energy charge&#8208;transfer states. An optimal gap of &#8764;0.4&#8197;eV yields efficient phosphorescence, with smaller gaps leading to thermally activated delayed fluorescence and larger gaps allowing triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation to dominate.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;free organic emitters that display solution&#8208;phase room temperature phosphorescence (sRTP) remain exceedingly rare. Here, we investigate the structural and photophysical properties that support sRTP by comparing a recently reported sRTP compound (BTaz&#8722;Th&#8722;PXZ) to two novel analogous materials, replacing the donor group by either acridine or phenothiazine. The emissive triplet excited state remains fixed in all three cases, while the emissive charge&#8208;transfer singlet states (and the calculated paired charge&#8208;transfer T2 state) vary with the donor unit. While all three materials show dominant RTP in film, in solution different singlet&#8208;triplet and triplet&#8208;triplet energy gaps give rise to triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation followed by weak sRTP for the new compounds, compared to dominant sRTP throughout for the original PXZ material. Engineering both the sRTP state and higher charge&#8208;transfer states therefore emerges as a crucial element in designing emitters capable of sRTP.

Engineering both the sRTP state and higher charge-transfer states therefore emerges as a crucial element in designing emitters capable of sRTP.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Insight into the Structural and Emissive Behavior of a Three&#8208;Dimensional Americium(III) Formate Coordination Polymer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported is the synthesis and characterization of a novel three&#8208;dimentional americium(III) formate coordination polymer, which features unique C3v site symmetry and atypical emission behavior. Rationalization of inner sphere bonding and unusual optical properties is supported by theoretical QTAIM and NLMO calculations.







Abstract
We report the structural, vibrational, and optical properties of americium formate (Am(CHO2)3) crystals synthesized via the in&#8197;situ hydrolysis of dimethylformamide (DMF). The coordination polymer features Am3+ ions linked by formate ligands into a three&#8208;dimensional network that is isomorphous to several lanthanide analogs, (e.&#8201;g., Eu3+, Nd3+, Tb3+). Structure determination revealed a nine&#8208;coordinate Am3+ metal center that features a unique local C3v symmetry. The metal&#8211;ligand bonding interactions were investigated by vibrational spectroscopy, natural localized molecular orbital calculations, and the quantum theory of atoms in molecules. The results paint a predominantly ionic bond picture and suggest the metal&#8208;oxygen bonds increase in strength from Nd&#8722;O&lt;Eu&#8722;O&lt;Am&#8722;O. The optical properties were probed using diffuse reflectance and photoluminescence spectroscopies. Notably, the rarely reported 5D1&#8242;&#8594;7F0&#8242; emission band is observed and dominates the emission spectrum. This behavior is unusual and is attributed to the C3v coordination environment of the metal center.

         <title>Promoting Amination of Furfural to Furfurylamine by Metal&#8208;support Interactions on Pd/MoO3&#8208;x Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reductive amination of carbonyl compounds is one of the most straightforward protocols to construct C&#8208;N bonds, but highly desires active and selective catalysts. Herein, Pd/MoO3&#8208;x catalysts are proposed for furfural amination, in which the interactions between Pd nanoparticles and MoO3&#8208;x supports can be easily ameliorated via varying preparation temperature toward efficient catalytic turnover. Thanks to the synergistic cooperation of MoV&#8208;rich MoO3&#8208;x and highly&#8208;dispersed Pd, the optimal catalysts afford the high yield of furfurylamine (84%) at 80 oC. Thereinto, MoV species not only acts as the acidic promoter to facilitate the activation of carbonyl groups, but also interacts with Pd nanoparticles to promote the subsequent hydrogenolysis of Schiff base N&#8208;furfurylidenefurfurylamine and its germinal diamine. The good efficiency of Pd/MoO3&#8208;x within a broad substrate scope further highlights the key contribution of metal&#8208;support interactions to the refinery of biomass feedstocks.</dc:description>

         <title>Fibrils Emerging from Droplets: Molecular Guiding Principles behind Phase Transitions of a Short Peptide&#8208;Based Condensate Studied by Solid&#8208;State NMR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biochemical reactions occurring in highly crowded cellular environments require different means of control to ensure productivity and specificity. Compartmentalization of reagents by liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation is one of these means. However, extremely high local protein concentrations of up to 400 mg/ml can result in pathological aggregation into fibrillar amyloid structures, a phenomenon that has been linked to various neurodegenerative diseases. Despite its relevance, the process of liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition inside condensates is still not well understood at the molecular level. We thus herein use small peptide derivatives that can undergo both liquid&#8208;liquid and subsequent liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid phase transition as model systems to study both processes. Using solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we compare the structure of condensed states of leucine, tryptophan and phenylalanine containing derivatives, distinguishing between liquid&#8208;like condensates, amorphous aggregates and fibrils, respectively. A structural model for the fibrils formed by the phenylalanine derivative was obtained by an NMR&#8208;based structure calculation. The fibrils are stabilised by hydrogen bonds and side&#8208;chain &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, which are likely much less pronounced or absent in the liquid and amorphous state. Such noncovalent interactions are equally important for the liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition of proteins, particularly those related to neurodegenerative diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimising Electrical Interfacing between the Trimeric Copper Nitrite Reductase and Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the immobilization of copper&#8208;containing NiR from Alcaligenes faecalis on functionalised MWCNT electrodes. We demonstrate that this immobilization is mainly driven by hydrophobic interactions, promoted by the modification of MWCNTs with adamantyl groups. Direct electrochemistry shows high bioelectrochemical reduction of nitrite at the redox potential of NiR with high current density of 1.41 mA cm&#8208;2. Furthermore, the desymmetrization of the trimer upon immobilization induces an independent electrocatalytic behavior for each of the three enzyme subunits, corroborated by an electron&#8208;tunneling distance dependence.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We report the immobilization of copper-containing NiR from Alcaligenes faecalis on functionalised MWCNT electrodes. We demonstrate that this immobilization is mainly driven by hydrophobic interactions, promoted by the modification of MWCNTs with adamantyl groups. Direct electrochemistry shows high bioelectrochemical reduction of nitrite at the redox potential of NiR with high current density of 1.41 mA cm-2. Furthermore, the desymmetrization of the trimer upon immobilization induces an independent electrocatalytic behavior for each of the three enzyme subunits, corroborated by an electron-tunneling distance dependence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical Preparation of Sm(II) Reagent Facilitated by Weakly Coordinating Anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Samarium diiodide (SmI2) is widely used as a strong one&#8208;electron reducing agent and is often employed to form C&#8208;&#8208;C bonds in complex systems. Despite their utility, SmI2 and related salts suffer from several drawbacks that render the use of Sm reducing agents in large&#8208;scale synthesis impractical. Here, we report factors influencing the electrochemical reduction of Sm(III) to Sm(II), towards the goal of electrocatalyti Sm(III) reduction. We probe the effect of supporting electrolyte, electrode material, and Sm precursor on Sm(II)/(III) redox and on the reducing power of the Sm species. We find that the coordination strength of the counteranion of the Sm salt affects the reversibility and redox potential of the Sm(II)/(III) couple and establish that the counteranion primarily determines the reducibility of Sm(III). Electrochemically generated SmI2 performs similarly to commercial SmI2 solutions in a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept reaction. The results will provide fundamental insight to facilitate the development of Sm&#8208;electrocatalytic reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Mechanically Interlocked Molecules to Recognize Anions and Cations: A Computational Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anions and cations develop several roles in nature. Thus, compounds capable to interact with ions show large relevancy. Mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) appear as potential candidates to perform efficient ionic recognition. Here, DFT calculations have been realized to elucidate and tune the MIM&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;(anion and/or cation) chemical bonds and compare them with the acyclic/cyclic molecular structures&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;(anion and/or cation) interactions.







Abstract
Ions appear as active components in diverse materials. Here, the bonding energy between mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) or their acyclic/cyclic molecular derivatives and i) Cl&#8722; and Br&#8722; ions and/or ii) Na+ and K+ ions, have been investigated. The chemical environment provided by MIMs is less preferably to recognize ionic species compared to unconstrained interactions that are furnished by acyclic molecules. However, MIMs can be more adequate structures for ionic recognition than cyclic compounds if a chemical arrangement of the bond sites that relevantly support more favorable interactions with ions compared to Pauli repulsive ambient is provided. The hydrogen replacement by electron donor (&#8722;NH2) or acceptor (&#8722;NO2) groups in MIMs favors the anion/cation recognition due to decreased Pauli repulsion energy and/or more attractive non&#8208;covalent bonds. This study clarifies the chemical environment provided by MIMs to interact with ions and highlights these molecules as relevant structures to realize ionic sensing.

         <title>Template&#8208;assisted Fabrication of O&#8208;doped CoP Microflowers with Optimal Electronic Modulation for Electrochemical Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, the O&#8208;doped CoP microflowers are synthesized via a self&#8208;sacrificial reactive template&#8208;engaged strategy. Benefiting from the structural and compositional advantages, the obtained sample with optimal electronic structure exhibits the excellent hydrogen evolution performance.







Abstract
Exploring efficient, affordable and stable electrocatalyst toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is of great scientific significance for the practical implementation of the water splitting. The heteroatom doping represents a serviceable strategy to further elevate the catalytic performance for a transition metal&#8208;based electrocatalyst because of the electronic regulation effect. Herein, a reliable self&#8208;sacrificial template&#8208;engaged approach is proposed to synthesize O&#8208;doped CoP (denoted as O&#8208;CoP) microflowers, which simultaneously considers the regualtion of electronic configuration via anion doping and sufficient exposure of active sites via nanostructure engineering. The suitable O incorporation content in CoP matrix could tremendously modify the electronic configuration, accelerate the charge transfer, promote the exposure of active sites, strengthen the electrical conductivity, and adjust the adsorption state of H*. Consequently, the optimized O&#8208;CoP microflowers with optimal O concentration display a remarkable HER property with a small overpotential of 125&#8197;mV to afford a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a low Tafel slope of 68&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 and long&#8208;term durability for 32&#8197;h under alkaline electrolyte, manifesting a considerable potential application for hydrogen production at large scale. The integration of anion incorporation and architecture engineering in this work will bring in a depth insight for the design of low&#8208;cost and effective electrocatalysts in energy conversion and storage systems.

         <title>Piezochromism and Conductivity Modulations under High Pressure by Manipulating the Viologen Radical Concentration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manipulating the  radical concentration to modulate the properties in solid multifunctional materials is an attractive topic in various frontier fields. Viologens have the unique redox capability to generate radical states through reversible electron transfer (ET) under external stimuli. Herein, taking the viologens as the model, two kinds of crystalline compounds with different molecule&#8208;conjugated systems were designed and synthesized. By subjecting the specific model viologens to pressure, the cross&#8208;conjugated 2&#8208;X all exhibit much higher radical concentrations, along with more sensitive piezochromic behaviors, compared to the linear&#8208;conjugated 1&#8208;X. Unexpectedly, we find that the electrical resistance (R) of 1&#8208;NO3 decreased by three orders of magnitude with the increasing pressure, while that in high&#8208;radical&#8208;concentration 2&#8208;NO3remained almost unchanged. To date, such unusual invariant conductivity has not been documented in molecular&#8208;based materials under high pressure, breaking the conventional wisdom that the generations of radicals are beneficial to improve conductivity. We highlight that adjusting the molecular conjugation modes can be used as an effective way to regulate the radical concentrations and thus modulate properties rationally.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity based on Dibenzodioxin Linkage: Design, Synthesis, Properties and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) over the last two decades have established them as a distinct class of microporous materials, which combine the attributes of microporous solid materials and soluble nature of glassy polymers. Because of their solubility in common organic solvents, PIMs are easily processable materials that can potentially find applications in membrane&#8208;based separation, catalysis, ion separation in electrochemical energy storage devices, sensing, etc. Dibenzodioxin linkage, Tr&#246;ger&#8242;s base and imide bond&#8208;forming reactions have widely been utilized for synthesis of a large number of PIMs. Among these linkages, however, majority of the studies have been based on dibenzodioxin&#8208;based PIMs. Therefore, this review focuses precisely on dibenzodioxin linkage chemistry. Herein, we discuss the design principles of different rigid and contorted monomer scaffolds, synthetic strategies of the polymers through dibenzodioxin&#8208;forming reactions including copolymerization and postsynthetic modifications, their characteristic properties and potential applications studied so far. Towards the end, we discuss the prospects of these materials with respect to their utility in industrial purposes. Further, we analyze the structure&#8208;property correlation of dibenzodioxin PIMs, which is essential for tailored synthesis and tunable properties of these PIMs and their molecular level engineering for enhanced performances making these materials suitable for commercial usage.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ambipolar molecular oligothiophene&#8208;fullerene dyads have not only reached power conver&#173;sion efficiencies of &gt;5% in single&#8208;material organic solar cells, but moreover belong to the most stable photoactive ma&#173;terials in organic solar cells. Outstanding thermal long term stabilities main&#173;&#173;taining 96% of the initial performance after 1 month of continuous illumination and ope&#173;ra&#173;&#173;tion were mea&#173;sured. In the series of do&#173;&#173;nor&#8208;acceptor dyads, D1&#8208;D4, the so far best perfor&#173;ming dyad D4 is built up in a &#8220;T&#8208;shaped&#8221; fashion, whereby the &#960;&#8208;con&#173;juga&#173;ted dithie&#173;no&#173;pyrrole&#8208;cored oligo&#173;thio&#173;phene do&#173;nor is covalently connected to a C70&#8208;ful&#173;le&#173;rene acceptor by a flexible alkyl ester linker comprising 8 atoms. In order to further develop this rati&#173;o&#173;nal molecular design, novel dyads D5&#8208;D10 were synthesized and characterized. The structural variations comprise the length of linker, elongated or shortened compared to the original series, and the variation of the terminal acceptor units in the donor part on the basis of the standard configuration of dyad D1. In this second series, systematically changed ab&#173;sorp&#173;tion profiles and energy levels of the frontier or&#173;bi&#173;tals are expected. All in all, valuable structure&#8208;pro&#173;perty relationships were ob&#173;tained and cor&#173;re&#173;lated to the photo&#173;vol&#173;taic performance in single&#8208;material organic solar cells, in which power conversion effi&#173;ci&#173;en&#173;cies of up to 4.3% were reached.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclotrimerization Approach to Symmetric [9]&#8208;Helical Indenofluorenes: Diverting Cyclization Pathways</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic cyclotrimerization routes to symmetrical [9]helical indenofluorene were explored by using different transition metal complexes and thermal conditions. Depending on reaction conditions, the cyclotrimerizations were accompanied by dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction giving rise to another type of aromatic compounds. Structures of both symmetrical [9]helical cyclotrimerization product as well as the dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder product were confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. Limits of enantioselective cyclotrimerization were assessed as well. DFT calculations shed light on the reaction course and the origin of diminished enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid Access to Encapsulated Molecular Rotors via Coordination&#8208;Driven Macrocycle Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrocycle formation that relies upon trans metal coordination of appropriately placed pyridine ligands within an arylene ethynylene construct provides rapid and reliable access to molecular rotors encapsulated within the macrocyclic framework. Showing no significant close contacts to the central rotors, X&#8208;ray crystallography of Ag(I)&#8208;coordinated macrocycles provides plausibility for free rotation or wobbling of rotors within the central cavity. Solid&#8208;state 13C NMR of Pd(II)&#8208;coordinated macrocycles supports the notion of unobstructed movement of simple arenes in the crystal lattice. Solution 1H NMR studies indicate complete and immediate macrocycle formation upon introduction of Pd(II) to the pyridyl&#8208;based ligand at room temperature. Moreover, the formed macrocycle is stable in solution; a lack of significant changes in the 1H NMR spectrum upon cooling to &#8208;50 &#176;C is consistent with the absence of dynamic behavior. The synthetic route to these macrocycles is expedient and modular, providing access to rather complex constructs in four simple steps involving Sonogashira coupling and deprotection reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Smart Wearable Patches Using Light&#8208;Controlled Activation and Delivery of Photoswitchable Antimicrobial Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel strategy to treat Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) skin infections is presented, where UV light is used to facilitate concomitant light&#8208;controlled activation and delivery of an antimicrobial therapeutic agent. Specifically, a new photoswitchable gramicidin S analogue was immobilized onto a polymeric wearable patch via a photocleavable linker that undergoes photolysis at the same wavelength of light required for activation of the peptide. Unlike toxic gramicidin S, the liberated active photoswitchable peptide exhibits antimicrobial activity against S. aureus while being ostensibly non&#8208;haemolytic to red blood cells. Moreover, irradiation with visible light switches off the antimicrobial properties of the peptide within seconds, presenting an ideal strategy to regulate antibiotic activity for localized bacterial infections with the potential to mitigate resistance.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalyzed (3+2) Cycloaddition for the Dearomatization of Electron&#8208;poor Arenes under Flow Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photocatalyzed dearomative reaction between various electron&#8208;deficient aromatic compounds and a non&#8208;stabilized azomethine ylide is successfully performed in a flow system. Whereas the use of supported eosin as organic photocatalyst exhibits limited efficiency, turning to the soluble Rose Bengal allows to transform a broad range of substrates from hetarenes (indole, benzofuran, quinoline, pyridine) to naphthalenes and benzenes. This photocatalyzed (3+2) dearomative cycloaddition under green light irradiation provides a simple and efficient access to tridimensional pyrrolidino scaffolds with a tetrasubstituted carbon center at ring junction and can be performed in the friendly ethyl acetate. Computational studies support the mechanism involving azomethine ylide as reactive species toward the electron&#8208;poor arene.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing Pillar[5]arene Host&#8208;Guest Complexation to Improve pH Stability and Affect Enzymatic Degradation of the Anticancer Prodrug Capecitabine: A 19F&#8208;NMR Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Cancer is a global health problem and supramolecular chemotherapy is emerging as a novel strategy to battle the disease. Here we first evaluated the thermodynamic and the kinetic stability of the complexes formed between several water&#8208;soluble per&#8208;substituted pillar[5]arene derivatives and capecitabine (1), a widely used oral chemotherapeutic prodrug. The exchange rate was studied, for the first time in pillararene chemistry, by the 19F guest exchange saturation transfer (GEST) NMR technique. Importantly, when we evaluated the effect of complexation on the characteristics of 1, we found that the complexation of 1 with such pillar[5]arene hosts increased capecitabine stability at acidic pH very significantly and slowed its enzymatic degradation by the carboxylesterase enzyme in a manner that depended on the host. These interesting findings may have implications on clinical use of this heavily used prodrug and may affect the management of cancer patients.</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular Palladium Catalyst Transfer on Benzoheterodiazoles as Acceptor Monomers and Discovery of Catalyst Transfer Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intramolecular catalyst transfer on benzoheterodiazoles was investigated in Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling reactions and polymerization reactions with tBu3PPd precatalyst. In the coupling reactions of dibromobenzotriazole, dibromobenzoxazole, and dibromobenzothiadiazole with pinacol phenylboronate, the product ratios of monosubstituted product to disubstituted product were 0/100, 27/73, and 89/11, respectively, indicating that the Pd catalyst undergoes intramolecular catalyst transfer on dibromobenzotriazole, whereas intermolecular transfer occurs in part in the case of dibromobenzoxazole and is predominant for dibromobenzothiadiazole. The polycondensation of 1.3 equivalents of dibromobenzotriazole with 1.0 equivalent of para&#8208; and meta&#8208;phenylenediboronates afforded high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymer and cyclic polymer, respectively. In the case of dibromobenzoxazole, however, para&#8208; and meta&#8208;phenylenediboronates afforded moderate&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymer with bromine at both ends and cyclic polymer, respectively. In the case of dibromobenzothiadiazole, they afforded low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers with bromine at both ends. Addition of benzothiadiazole derivatives interfered with catalyst transfer in the coupling reactions.</dc:description>

In the case of dibromobenzothiadiazole, they afforded low-molecular-weight polymers with bromine at both ends. Addition of benzothiadiazole derivatives interfered with catalyst transfer in the coupling reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multiply exo&#8208;Methylated Corannulenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The curved &#960;&#8208;conjugated surface of bowl&#8208;shaped corannulene is multiply methylated to form exo&#8208;di&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, and hexamethylated corannulenes. The multimethylations have become possible by in&#8208;situ iterative reduction/methylation sequences that involve the reduction of corannulenes using sodium to form the anionic corannulene species and the subsequent SN2 reaction of the anionic species with reduction&#8208;resistant dimethyl sulfate. X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses, NMR, MS, UV&#8208;Vis measurements, and DFT calculations have revealed the molecular structures of the multi&#8208;methylated corannulenes and the sequence of the multi&#8208;methylation. This work has the potential to contribute to the controlled synthesis and characterizations of multi&#8208;functionalized fullerenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Squaramide&#8208;based Heteroditopic [2]Rotaxanes for Sodium Halide Ion&#8208;pair Recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of squaramide&#8208;based heteroditopic [2]rotaxanes consisting of isophthalamide macrocycle and squaramide axle components are synthesised using an alkali metal cation template&#8208;directed stoppering methodology. This work highlights the unprecedented sodium cation template coordination of the Lewis basic squaramide carbonyls for interlocked structure synthesis. Extensive quantitative 1H&#8208;NMR spectroscopic anion and ion&#8208;pair recognition studies reveal the [2]rotaxane hosts are capable of cooperative sodium halide ion&#8208;pair mechanical bond axle&#8208;macrocycle component recognition, eliciting up to 20&#8208;fold enhancements in binding strengths for bromide and iodide, wherein the Lewis basic carbonyls and Lewis acidic NH hydrogen bond donors of the squaramide axle motif operate as cation and anion receptive sites simultaneously in an ambidentate fashion. Notably, varying the length and nature of the polyether cation binding unit of the macrocycle component dramatically influences the ion&#8208;pair binding affinities of the [2]rotaxanes, even overcoming direct contact NaCl ion&#8208;pair binding modes in polar organic solvents. Furthermore, the cooperative ion&#8208;pair binding properties of the squaramide&#8208;based heteroditopic [2]rotaxanes are exploited to successfully extract solid sodium halide salts into organic media.</dc:description>

         <title>External Flash Generation of Carbenoids Enables Monodeuteration of Dihalomethanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, incorporation of one deuterium atom was achieved by H&#8722;D exchange of one of the two identical methylene protons in various dihalomethanes (halogen = Cl, Br, and I) through a rapid&#8208;mixing microflow reaction of lithium diisopropylamide as a strong base and deuterated methanol as a deuteration reagent. Generation of highly unstable carbenoid intermediate and suppression of its decomposition were successfully controlled under high flow&#8208;rate conditions. Monofunctionalization of diiodomethane afforded various building blocks composed of boryl, stannyl, and silyl groups. The monodeuterated diiodomethane, which served as a deuterated C1 source, was subsequently subjected to diverted functionalization methods to afford various products including biologically important molecules bearing isotope labelling at specific positions and homologation products with monodeuteration.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Engineering in Covalent Organic Polymers for High&#8208;Performance Li&#8208;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries are promising energy storage technology due to their tempting high theoretical capacity and energy density. Nevertheless, the wastage of active materials that originates from the shuttling effect of polysulfides still hinders advancement of Li&#8208;S batteries. The effective design of cathode materials is extremely pivotal to solve this thorny problem. Herein, Surface engineering in covalent organic polymers (COPs) has been performed to investigate the influence of pore wall polarity on the performance of COP&#8208;based cathodes used for Li&#8208;S batteries. With the assistance of experimental investigation and theoretical calculations, performance improvement by increasing pore surface polarity and a synergy effect of the polarized functionalities, along with nano&#8208;confinement effect of the COPs, are disclosed, to which the improved performance of Li&#8208;S batteries including outstanding Coulombic efficiency (99.0%) and extremely low capacity decay (0.08% over 425 cycles at 1.0 C) is attributed. This work not only enlightens the designable synthesis and applications of covalent polymers as polar sulfur hosts with high utilization of active materials, but also provides a feasible guide for the design of effective cathode materials for future advanced Li&#8208;S batteries.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>NiFe&#8208;layered double hydroxide (NiFe&#8208;LDH) is the benchmark catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline medium, however, it is still challenging to improve its activity and stability. Herein, NiFe&#8208;LDH macroporous array electrodes are demonstrated to significantly enhance the activity and stability for oxygen evolution reaction. The electrodes are fabricated by the chemical and electrochemical corrosion process of Ni foam induced by ferric nitrate, hydrochloric acid and oxygen. are prepared by a controllable corrosion strategy for oxygen evolution reaction. By optimizing the amount of iron salt and acid and selecting the appropriate reaction temperature and time, The NiFe&#8208;LDH electrodes only need the overpotential of 180 mV and 248 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2 and 500 mA cm&#8208;2, respectively, and remain highly stable for 1000 h at 500 mA cm&#8208;2. The unique macroporous array not only significantly increases the active area of NiFe&#8208;LDH catalyst, but also creates a stable nanostructure that avoids severe reconstruction.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable and reusable Fe3O4/ZIF&#8208;8 composite for encapsulation of FDH enzyme in mild conditions applicable to CO2 reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enzymatic reduction of carbon dioxide presents limited applicability due to denaturation and the impossibility of biocatalyst recovery; disadvantages that can be minimized by its immobilization. Here, a recyclable bio&#8208;composed system was constructed by in situ encapsulation in mild conditions of formate dehydrogenase enzyme in the ZIF&#8208;8 metalorganic framework (MOF) in the presence of magnetite. The partial dissolution of ZIF&#8208;8 in the enzyme&#8217;s operation media can be relatively inhibited if the concentration of magnetic support used exceeds 10 mg mL&#8208;1. The bio&#8208;friendly environment for immobilization does not harm the integrity of the biocatalyst while the production of formic acid is improved 3.4&#8208;fold compared to the free enzyme because the MOFs act as a concentrator of the enzymatic cofactor. Furthermore, the bio&#8208;composed system retains 86 % of its activity after a long&#8208;time of 5 cycles, indicating an excellent magnetic recovery capacity and a good reusability.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Control over the binding stoichiometry and the threading kinetics is achieved in pseudorotaxanes comprising the anion&#8208;binding cyanostar macrocycle and organic pyrophosphonates with fine&#8208;tuned steric bulk. The approach allowed the selective assembly of [3]pseudorotaxanes and [2]pseudorotaxanes, and it provided insights that are valuable for future work on anion recognition and the design of molecular machines.







Abstract
The supramolecular recognition of anions is increasingly harnessed to achieve the self&#8208;assembly of supramolecular architectures, ranging from cages and polymers to (pseudo)rotaxanes. The cyanostar (CS) macrocycle has previously been shown to form 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 complexes with organophosphate anions that can be turned into [3]rotaxanes by stoppering. Here we achieved steric control over the assembly of pseudorotaxanes comprising the cyanostar macrocycle and a thread that is based, for the first time, on organo&#8208;pyrophosphonates. Subtle differences in steric bulk on the threads allowed formation of either [3]pseudorotaxanes or [2]pseudorotaxanes. We demonstrate that the threading kinetics are governed by the steric demand of the organo&#8208;pyrophosphonates and in one case, slows down to the timescale of minutes. Calculations show that the dianions are sterically offset inside the macrocycles. Our findings broaden the scope of cyanostar&#8208;anion assemblies and may have relevance for the design of molecular machines whose directionality is a result of relatively slow slipping.

         <title>Radical&#8208;Based Convergent Paired Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical&#8208;based convergent paired electrolysis, which is driven by inexpensive electricity, is a green and unique approach to otherwise challenging redox&#8208;neutral reactions. The difficulty associated with the technique is imposed by the fleeting nature of radicals and the gap between electrodes. This concept article introduces recent state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advances in this field and discusses how to overcome the obstacles.







Abstract
Electrochemistry offers a sustainable platform for discovering reactions involving single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) that generates highly reactive and synthetically versatile radical species. Compared with photochemistry similarly specializing in SET which requires expensive photocatalysts, electrochemistry employs low&#8208;cost electricity to drive the electron flow. Paired electrolysis makes use of both half&#8208;reactions, thus obviating the need for sacrificial reactions and maximizing the atom and energy economy. In convergent paired electrolysis, anodic oxidation and cathodic reduction occur simultaneously to generate two intermediates, which are then coupled to furnish the product. It represents a distinctive approach to challenging redox&#8208;neutral reactions. However, the gap between the two electrodes makes it hard for a reactive intermediate to come across the other coupling partner. This concept article summarizes recent state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advances on radical&#8208;based convergent paired electrolysis, which adopted different strategies to overcome the difficulty.

         <title>Highly Electrophilic Mononuclear Cationic Aluminum Alkoxide Complexes: Syntheses, Reactivity and Catalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report on the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;diketiminate supported aluminum complexes bearing terminal alkoxide and mono&#8208;thiol functional groups: LAlOMe(Et) (2), LAlOtBu(Et) (3), and LAlSH(Et) (4), (L= [HC{C(Me)N&#8208;(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3)}2]). Complexes 2 and 3 are further utilized as synthons to generate some fascinating cationic aluminum alkoxide complexes, [LAlOMe(&#181;&#8208;OMe)&#8208;Al(Et)L][EtB(C6F5)3] (5), [LAlOMe(OEt2)][EtB(C6F5)3] (6), and [LAlOtBu(OEt2)][EtB(C6F5)3] (8). These electrophilic cationic species are well characterized by spectroscopic and crystallographic techniques. The assessment of Lewis acidity by the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method revealed superior Lewis acidity of the cations substituted with electron demanding alkoxy groups in comparison to the known methyl analogue [LAlMe][B(C6F5)4]. This has been further endorsed by computational calculations to determine the NBO charges and hydride ion affinity for complexes 6 and 8. These complexes are also capable of activating triethylsilane in stoichiometric reactions. The applicability of these complexes has been realized in the hydrosilylation of ethers, carbonyls, and olefines. Additionally, the solid state structure of a new THF stabilized aluminum halide cation [LAlCl(THF)][B(C6F5)4] (11) has also been reported.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid Chemical Synthesis of Serine Protease Inhibitor Kazal&#8208;type 13 (SPINK13) Glycoform by a Combined Method with Glycan Insertion Strategy and Fast&#8208;Flow Fmoc SPPS

Glycosylated asparagine thioacid was designed to chemoselectively be inserted between two peptide segments at the sterically bulky amino acids sequence Pro&#8208;Asn(N&#8208;glycan)&#8208;Val junction by two coupling reactions which consist of diacyl disulfide coupling (DDC) and thioacid capture ligation (TCL). The both N and C terminus peptides were prepared by a fast&#8208;flow Fmoc SPPS method. A combined method with DDC, TCL and a fast&#8208;flow Fmoc SPPS method successfully shortened the route of glycoprotein synthesis.







Abstract
Serine protease inhibitor Kazal type 13 (SPINK13) is a secreted protein that has been recently studied as a therapeutic drug and an interesting biomarker for cancer cells. Although SPINK13 has a consensus sequence (Pro&#8208;Asn&#8208;Val&#8208;Thr) for N&#8208;glycosylation, the existence of N&#8208;glycosylation and its functions are still unclear. In addition to this, the preparation of glycosylated SPINK 13 has not been examined by both the cell expression method and chemical synthesis. Herein we report the chemical synthesis of the scarce N&#8208;glycosylated form of SPINK13 by a rapid synthetic method combined with the chemical glycan insertion strategy and a fast&#8208;flow SPPS method. Glycosylated asparagine thioacid was designed to chemoselectively be inserted between two peptide segments where is the sterically bulky Pro&#8208;Asn(N&#8208;glycan)&#8208;Val junction by two coupling reactions which consist of diacyl disulfide coupling (DDC) and thioacid capture ligation (TCL). This insertion strategy successfully afforded the full&#8208;length polypeptide of SPINK13 within two steps from glycosylated asparagine thioacid. Because the two peptides used for this synthesis were prepared by a fast&#8208;flow SPPS, the total synthetic time of glycoprotein was considerably shortened. This synthetic concept enables us to repetitively synthesize a target glycoprotein easily. Folding experiments afforded well&#8208;folded structure confirmed by CD and disulfide bond map. Invasion assays of glycosylated SPINK13 and non&#8208;glycosylated SPINK13 with pancreatic cancer cells showed that non&#8208;glycosylated SPINK&#8208;13 was more potent than that of glycosylated SPINK13.

         <title>Ultrasmall Gold Nanoparticles as Clients of Biomolecular Condensates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) of biopolymers to form condensates is a widespread phenomenon in living cells. Agents that target or alter condensation can help uncover elusive physiological and pathological mechanisms. Owing to their unique material properties and modes of interaction with biomolecules, nanoparticles represent attractive condensate&#8208;targeting agents.
Our work focused on elucidating the interaction between ultrasmall gold nanoparticles (usGNPs) and diverse types of condensates of tau, a representative phase&#8208;separating protein associated with neurodegenerative disorders. usGNPs attract considerable interest in the biomedical community due to unique features, including emergent optical properties and good cell penetration. We explored the interaction of usGNPs with reconstituted self&#8208;condensates of tau, two&#8208;component tau/polyanion and three&#8208;component tau/RNA/alpha&#8208;synuclein coacervates.
The usGNPs were found to concentrate into condensed liquid droplets, consistent with the formation of dynamic client (nanoparticle) &#8211; scaffold (tau) interactions, and were observable thanks to their intrinsic luminescence. Furthermore, usGNPs were capable to promote LLPS of a protein domain which is unable to phase separate on its own.
Our study demonstrates the ability of usGNPs to interact with and illuminate protein condensates. We anticipate that nanoparticles will have broad applicability as nanotracers to interrogate phase separation, and as nanoactuators controlling the formation and dissolution of condensates.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of biopolymers to form condensates is a widespread phenomenon in living cells. Agents that target or alter condensation can help uncover elusive physiological and pathological mechanisms. Owing to their unique material properties and modes of interaction with biomolecules, nanoparticles represent attractive condensate-targeting agents.

         <title>Synthesis of neuraminidase&#8208;resistant sialyllactose mimetics from Nacyl mannosamines using metabolically engineered Escherichia coli</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe the efficient gram&#8208;scale synthesis of &#945;2,3&#8208; and &#945;2,6&#8208;sialyllactose oligosaccharides as well as mimetics from N&#8208;acyl mannosamines and lactose in metabolically engineered bacterial cells grown at high cell density. We designed new E. coli strains coexpressing sialic acid synthase and N&#8208;acylneuraminate cytidylyltransferase from Campylobacter jejuni together with the &#945;2,3&#8208;sialyltransferase from Neisseria meningitidis or the &#945;2,6sialyltransferase from Photobacterium sp. JT&#8208;ISH&#8208;224. Using their mannose transporter, these new strains actively internalized N&#8208;acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) and its N&#8208;propanoyl (N&#8208;Prop), N&#8208;butanoyl (N&#8208;But) and N&#8208;phenylacetyl (N&#8208;PhAc) analogs and converted them into the corresponding sialylated oligosaccharides, with overall yields between 10% and 39% (200&#8208;700 mg.L&#8208;1 of culture). The three &#945;2,6&#8208;sialyllactose analogs showed similar binding affinity for Sambucus nigra SNA&#8208;I lectin as for the natural oligosaccharide. They also proved to be stable competitive inhibitors of Vibrio cholerae neuraminidase. These N&#8208;acyl sialosides therefore hold promise for the development of anti&#8208;adhesion therapy against influenza viral infections.</dc:description>

         <title>Five Novel Silver&#8208;Based Coordination Polymers as Photoluminescent Sensing Platforms for the Detection of Nitrobenzene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrobenzene (NB) is a highly toxic chemical and a cause for concern to human health and the environment. Hence, it is worthwhile to design new efficient and robust sensing platform for NB. In this study, we present three newly synthesized luminescent silver cluster&#8208;based coordination polymers, {[Ag10(StBu)6(CF3COO)4(hpbt)] (DMAc)2(CH3CN)2}n (hpbt = N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;N&#8221;,N&#8221;&#8208;hexa(pyridine&#8208;4&#8208;yl)benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triamine), [Ag12(StBu)6(CF3COO)6(bpva)3]n (bpva = 9,10&#8208;Bis(2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)vinyl)anthracene), and {[Ag12(StBu)6(CF3COO)6(bpb)(DMAc)2(H2O)2] (DMAc)2}n (bpb = 1,4&#8208;Bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)benzene) composed of Ag10, Ag12 and Ag12 cluster cores, respectively, connected by multidentate pyridine linkers. Besides, two new luminescent polymorphic silver(I)&#8208;based coordination polymers, [Ag(CF3COO)(dpa)]n (dpa = 9,10&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl)anthracene) referred to as Agdpa (H) and Agdpa (R), where H and R denote the hexagon&#8208;like and rod&#8208;like crystal shapes, respectively, have been prepared. The coordination polymers exhibit highly sensitive luminescence quenching effect to NB, attributed to the &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking interactions between the polymers and NB as well as the electron&#8208;withdrawing character of NB.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Crystal Structures, and Ion Pairing of &#954;6N Complexes with Rare Earth Elements in the Solid State and in Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rare earth element complexes (Ln = Y, La, Sm, Lu, Ce) of several podant &#954;6N&#8208;coordinating ligands have been synthetized and thoroughly characterized. The structural properties of the complexes have been investigated by X&#8208;ray diffraction in the solid state and by advanced NMR methods in solution. To estimate the donor capabilities of the presented ligands, an experimental comparison study has been conducted by cyclic voltammetry as well as absorption experiments using the cerium complexes and by analyzing 89Y NMR chemical shifts of the different yttrium complexes. In order to obtain a complete and detailed picture, all experiments were corroborated by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantum chemical calculations. Finally, coordination competition studies have been carried out by means of 1H and 31P NMR spectroscopy to investigate the correlation with donor properties and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A fluorescent isocoumarin&#8208;fused cycloalkyne
IC9O&#8208;COOMe that is reactive in SPAAC and gives fluorescent triazoles regardless of an azide nature was developed. The study of the S1 state deactivation mechanism of the non&#8208;fluorescent isocumarin&#8208;fused cycloalkyne IC9O using multi&#8208;configurational ab initio and DFT methodologies showed that deactivation proceeds through the electrocyclic ring opening of &#945;&#8208;pyrone and is accompanied by a redistribution of electron density in the fused benzene ring. We proposed that the S1 excited state deactivation barrier can be increased by introducing an acceptor group into a position with a decreasing electron density. As a proof of concept, we designed and synthesized isocumarin&#8208;fused cycloalkyne IC9O&#8208;COOMe bearing electron withdrawing group (COOMe) at the C6 position, which actually turned out to be fluorescent and underwent SPAAC to form fluorescent triazole derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Promoted Basic Nitrogen Unmasking in Arene Ruthenium Complexes Derived from Z&#8208;configured 2,2'&#8208;Azobispyridine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two novel 2,2'&#8208;azobispyridine derivatives bearing N&#8208;dialkylamino substituents at position 4,4' were synthesized and their E&#8208;Z photoswitching behavior was characterized by combination of 1H&#8208; and 13C&#8208;NMR spectroscopy, UV&#8208;vis absorption and DFT calculations. Both isomers act as ligands towards arene&#8208;Ru(II) centers, leading either to E&#8208;configured 5&#8208;membered chelates (involving coordination of nitrogen atoms from N=N bond and pyridine) or to the uncommon Z&#8208;configured 7&#8208;membered chelates (involving coordination of nitrogen atoms from both pyridines). The latter show good stability in the dark, allowing single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction study to be reported here for the first time. All synthesized Z&#8208;configured arene&#8208;Ru(II) complexes undergo irreversible photo&#8208;isomerization to their corresponding E isomers with rearrangement of their coordination pattern; this property was advantageously exploited for the light&#8208;promoted unmasking of a basic nitrogen atom of the ligand.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Alkoxylation, Dehydrogenative&#8208;Polymerization and Tandem Hydrosilylative&#8208;Alkoxylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkoxylation, hydrosilylative&#8208;alkoxylation, and dehydrogenative&#8208;polymerization are some of the most widely used transformations in synthetic chemistry. However, these transformations are traditionally catalyzed by precious, and rare late&#8208;transition metals. Presented here is a molecularly defined iron complex that catalyzes alkoxylation, tandem hydrosilylative&#8208;alkoxylation, and dehydrogenative polymerization of silanes under mild conditions. The iron complex [Fe(CO)4(H)(SiPh3)] 1 catalyzes a direct Si&#8208;O coupling reaction between an array of silanes and alcohols to produce desired alkoxysilanes in excellent yield, with H2 as the only byproduct. The iron catalyst tolerates various functional groups and provides access to 20 alkoxysilanes, including essential molecules such as &#946;&#8208;citronellol and cholesterol. Further, complex 1 catalyzes the polymerization of renewable diol and silane monomer to produce a renewable and degradable poly(isosorbide&#8208;silyl ether). Remarkably, complex 1 catalyzes a tandem hydrosilylative&#8208;alkoxylation of alkynes under mild conditions to yield unsaturated silyl ethers. The synthetic utility has been demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale alkoxylation and hydrosilylative&#8208;alkoxylation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Acidic CO2 electrolysis addressing the "alkalinity issue" and achieving high CO2 utilization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) provides a promising approach for sustainable chemical fuel production of carbon neutrality. Neutral and alkaline electrolytes are predominantly employed in the current electrolysis system, but with striking drawbacks of (bi)carbonate (CO32&#8722;/HCO3&#8722;) formation and crossover due to the rapid and thermodynamically favorable reaction between hydroxide (OH&#8722;) with CO2, resulting in low carbon utilization efficiency and short&#8208;lived catalysis. Very recently, CO2RR in acidic media can effectively address the (bi)carbonate issue; however, the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is more kinetically favorable in acidic electrolytes, which dramatically reduces CO2 conversion efficiency. Thus, it is a big challenge to effectively suppress HER and accelerate acidic CO2RR. In this review, we begin by summarizing the recent progress of acidic CO2 electrolysis, discussing the key factors limiting the application of acidic electrolytes. We then systematically discuss addressing strategies for acidic CO2 electrolysis, including electrolyte microenvironment modulation, alkali cations adjusting, surface/interface functionalization, nanoconfinement structural design, and novel electrolyzer exploitation. Finally, the new challenges and perspectives of acidic CO2 electrolysis are suggested. We believe this timely review can arouse researchers' attention to CO2 crossover, inspire new insights to solve the "alkalinity problem" and enable CO2RR as a more sustainable technology.</dc:description>

         <title>A Pyramidal Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks&#8208;Derived FeP@CoP Aluminium&#8208;Ion Battery Cathode Displaying Low&#8208;Temperature Tolerance and Fast Electron Transfer Kinetics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
FeP@CoP nanorods derived from pyramidal metal organic frameworks were developed as aluminum&#8208;ion battery cathode, which displays excellent electrochemical performance and fast electron transfer kinetics.







Abstract
Anhui Provincial Engineering Laboratory for Engineering appropriate cathode materials is significant for the development of high&#8208;performance aluminum&#8208;ion (Al&#8208;ion) batteries. Here, a pyramidal metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs)&#8208;derived FeP@CoP composite was developed as cathode, which exhibits good stability and high capacity. FeP@CoP cathode maintains a high capacity of 168&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles, and displays a stable rate&#8208;performance at both room and low temperatures of &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C. After three rounds of rate&#8208;performance cycling, the FeP@CoP composite recovers 178.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.3&#8197;A g&#8722;1. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) calculations verify improved electron&#8208;transfer kinetics with narrowed band gap and enhanced density of states. These findings inspire a broad set of studies on MOFs&#8208;derived composites for high&#8208;performance secondary batteries.

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure and High&#8208;Temperature Dion&#8211;Jacobson Layered Perovskite Polymorphs of KWO3F</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural relationship between the known normal&#8208;pressure modification of KWO3F and its two new siblings synthesized under high pressure and at high temperature is explored. The three polymorphs exhibit varying degrees of symmetry, but all of them belong to an overarching Dion&#8211;Jacobson layered perovskite structure type. In addition to a thorough examination of the phase transitions of KWO3F specifically, this work provides a closer look at the role of anion site occupation in phase transitions of mixed&#8208;anion compounds.







Abstract
Two new Dion&#8211;Jacobson layered perovskite polymorphs of the known oxyfluoride compound KWO3F are reported. A high&#8208;pressure modification was synthesized using a multianvil setup and subsequently transformed into a high&#8208;temperature phase at &#8764;311&#8201;&#176;C. The crystal structures of both polymorphs were determined by use of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and are described in detail herein. Differential thermal analyses and thermogravimetric analyses were carried out to further investigate the phase transition characteristics. Bond valence (BV) and charge distribution (CHARDI) calculations confirm the occupancy of mixed O|F anion positions, and Rietveld refinements as well as MAPLE calculations support the structure models.

         <title>A Feasible Strategy for a Highly Efficient Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter Over 900&#8201;nm Based on Phenalenone Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel NIR TADF organic emitters, namely OPDC&#8208;DTPA and OPDC&#8208;DBBPA, were first designed and compared in parallel. Neat films of OPDC&#8208;DTPA and OPDC&#8208;DBBPA present real NIR emission with peaks at 962 and 1003&#8197;nm, respectively. Encouragingly, the solution processable doped NIR OLEDs based on OPDC&#8208;DBBPA exhibits a maximum of 0.103&#8201;% with an emission at a peak wavelength of 906&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) suffer from the low external electroluminescence (EL) quantum efficiency (EQE), which is a critical obstacle for potential applications. Herein, 1&#8208;oxo&#8208;1&#8208;phenalene&#8208;2,3&#8208;dicarbonitrile (OPDC) is employed as an electron&#8208;withdrawing aromatic ring, and by incorporating with triphenylamine (TPA) and biphenylphenylamine (BBPA) donors, two novel NIR emitters with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) characteristics, namely OPDC&#8208;DTPA and OPDC&#8208;DBBPA, are first developed and compared in parallel. Intense NIR emission peaks at 962 and 1003&#8197;nm are observed in their pure films, respectively. Contributed by the local excited (LE) characteristics in the triplet (T1) state in synergy with the charge transfer (CT) characteristics for the singlet (S1) state to activate TADF emission, the solution processable doped NIR OLEDs based on OPDC&#8208;DTPA and OPDC&#8208;DBBPA yield EL peaks at 834 and 906&#8197;nm, accompanied with maximum EQEs of 0.457 and 0.103&#8201;%, respectively, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art EL performances in the TADF emitter&#8208;based NIR&#8208;OLEDs in the similar EL emission regions so far. This work manifests a simple and effective strategy for the development of NIR TADF emitters with long wavelength and efficiency synchronously.

Encouragingly, the solution processable doped NIR OLEDs based on OPDC-DBBPA exhibits a maximum of 0.103&#8201;% with an emission at a peak wavelength of 906&#8197;nm.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near-infrared (NIR) organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) suffer from the low external electroluminescence (EL) quantum efficiency (EQE), which is a critical obstacle for potential applications. Herein, 1-oxo-1-phenalene-2,3-dicarbonitrile (OPDC) is employed as an electron-withdrawing aromatic ring, and by incorporating with triphenylamine (TPA) and biphenylphenylamine (BBPA) donors, two novel NIR emitters with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) characteristics, namely OPDC-DTPA and OPDC-DBBPA, are first developed and compared in parallel. Intense NIR emission peaks at 962 and 1003&#8197;nm are observed in their pure films, respectively. Contributed by the local excited (LE) characteristics in the triplet (T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) state in synergy with the charge transfer (CT) characteristics for the singlet (S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) state to activate TADF emission, the solution processable doped NIR OLEDs based on OPDC-DTPA and OPDC-DBBPA yield EL peaks at 834 and 906&#8197;nm, accompanied with maximum EQEs of 0.457 and 0.103&#8201;%, respectively, representing the state-of-the-art EL performances in the TADF emitter-based NIR-OLEDs in the similar EL emission regions so far. This work manifests a simple and effective strategy for the development of NIR TADF emitters with long wavelength and efficiency synchronously.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nms&#8208;Amides: An Amine Protecting Group with Unique Stability and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
p&#8208;Toluenesulfonyl (Tosyl) and nitrobenzenesulfonyl (Nosyl) are two of the most common sulfonyl protecting groups for amines in contemporary organic synthesis. While p&#8208;toluenesulfonamides are known for their high stability and robustness, their use in multistep synthesis is plagued by difficult removal. Nitrobenzenesulfonamides, on the other hand, are easily cleaved but display limited stability to various reaction conditions. In an effort to resolve this conundrum, we herein present Nms&#8208;amides, initially developed through in silico studies, which overcome these previous limitations and leave no room for compromise, enabling a range of transformations that are not possible with traditional sulfonamide protecting groups.

Initially developed through in silico studies, Nms&#8208;amides overcome these previous limitations and leave no room for compromise. We have investigated the incorporation, robustness and cleavability of this group and found it to be superior to traditional sulfonamide protecting groups in a broad range of case studies.

         <title>Isoform&#8208;Selective Fluorescent Labeling of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#963; by Acrylamide&#8208;Containing Fusicoccins</title>

14&#8208;3&#8208;3 isoforms and the elucidation of their biological roles: In vitro isoform&#8208;selective fluorescent labeling of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#963; was achieved by a fusicoccin derivative containing a fluorophore and a Cys&#8208;directed acrylamide group. The reaction proceeds upon ternary complex formation with mode&#8208;3 phosphopeptide, which possesses i+1 aliphatic residues.







Abstract
The 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 family of proteins is central to the regulation of signaling pathways driven by serine/threonine kinases. In humans, 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 consists of seven highly conserved isoforms, yet the function of each isoform remains to be fully elucidated. Synthetic agents capable of isoform&#8208;specific fluorescent labeling of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 would provide a useful tool for studying in depth the biological roles of isoforms. In this study, the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#963; isoform was evaluated, which possesses a unique Cys38, and a natural product&#8208;based fluorescent labeling agent was designed by introducing an acrylamide group and a fluorescent dye to fusicoccin (FC). In vitro evaluation demonstrated that 12&#8208;hydroxy 1 and 2 exhibit 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#963; selective labeling activity over 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#950; in the presence of a mode&#8208;3 phospholigand. Furthermore, 2 was shown to label 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#963; in cell lysate in the presence of a C&#8208;terminal mode&#8208;3 phosphopeptide derived from ER&#945;, with no apparent nonspecific labeling. These results indicate that 2 is capable of selective fluorescent detection of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#963; upon binding to mode&#8208;3 phospholigand under biologically relevant conditions.

         <title>Direct C(3)5&#8722;H Polyfluoroarylation of 2&#8208;Amino/alkoxy Pyridines Enabled by a Transient and Electron&#8208;deficient Palladium Intermediate</title>

         <dc:description>
A transiently formed electrophilic polyfluoroaryl&#8208;Pd species overrides the unproductive N&#8208;coordination enabling a remote selective polyfluoroarylation of 2&#8208;amino/alkoxy&#8208;pyridines. The strategy allowed rapid construction of polyfluorinated heterobiaryls containing bioactive molecules and drug derivatives in good yields.







Abstract
Herein, we present an unprecedented azine&#8208;limited C5&#8722;H polyfluoroarylation of 2&#8208;aminopyridines enabled by a transient and electron&#8208;deficient perfluoroaryl&#8208;Pd species via C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H coupling. The protocol further allows C3(5)&#8722;H polyfluoroarylation of 2&#8208;alkoxypyridines guided by sterics and electronics for the first time. The late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization of drugs, drug derivatives, and natural product derivatives and synthesis of C5&#8208;aryl drug derivatives further demonstrated the method's utility. The preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that the synergistic combination of the bulky yet electrophilic perfluoroaryl&#8208;Pd species and the partial nucleophilicity of the C5&#8208;position of 2&#8208;amino/alkoxy&#8208;pyridines is the origin of reactivity and selectivity. Importantly, the first experimental evidence for the role of diisopropyl sulfide is provided.

         <title>Low&#8208;Pressure Sensitive Piezochromic Fluorescence Switching of Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;Anthraquinone</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly sensitive piezochromic fluorescent switching under low&#8208;pressure regimes (&#8764;60&#8197;kPa) of tetraphenylethylene&#8208;anthraquinone (TPE&#8208;AQ) is based on the controlled molecular design and polymorphic crystal strategy. The underlying mechanism of the low&#8208;pressure sensitive piezochromic fluorescence switching is demonstrated to be closely related to the loosely packed molecular orientation.







Abstract
Sensing of low&#8208;pressure signals is of great importance for cutting&#8208;edge technologies. Organic piezochromic molecules offer a promising library of pressure sensitive materials which can be tailor&#8208;designed toward specific requirements. However, very few examples of low&#8208;pressure sensitive piezochromic fluorescent molecules have been obtained till date, and the underlying mechanisms are still in its infancy. Herein, we report highly sensitive piezochromic fluorescent switching under low&#8208;pressure regimes (&#8764;60&#8197;kPa) of tetraphenylethylene&#8208;anthraquinone (TPE&#8208;AQ) based on the controlled molecular design and polymorphic phase strategy. The influence of both intramolecular conformation effect and variations of intermolecular stacking modes on the piezochromic property of TPE&#8208;AQ is investigated. The underlying mechanism of the low&#8208;pressure sensitive piezochromic fluorescence switching is demonstrated to be closely related to the loosely packed molecular orientation, as confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements combined with simulations. This work provides a way to design highly efficient pressure sensors based on organic molecular systems.

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Diastereomerically Pure Titanocenes by Dynamic Conformational Locking</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: The synthesis of enantiomerically pure titanocenes is limited to cases with enantiomerically pure substituents at the cyclopentadienyl ligands and to ansa&#8208;titanocenes. For the latter complexes, the use of achiral ligands requires a resolution of enantiomers and frequently also a separation of the diastereoisomers obtained after metalation. Here, we introduce a new synthetic method that relies on the use of enantiomerically pure camphorsulfonate (CSA) ligands as control elements for the absolute and relative configuration of titanocene complexes. Starting from the conformationally flexible (RC5H4)2TiCl2, the desired conformationally locked and hence enantio&#8208; and diastereomerically pure complexes (RC5H4)2Ti(CSA)2 are obtained in just two steps. According to X&#8208;ray crystallography the (RC5H4)2Ti fragment is essentially C2&#8208;symmetric and nuclear magnetic resonance displays overall C2&#8208;symmetry. We applied density functional theory methods to unravel the dynamics of the complexes and the mechanisms and selectivities of their formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioenriched Boron C,N&#8208;Chelates via Chirality Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chirality transfer strategy was established to access enantioenriched boron C,N&#8208;chelates stereogenic only at the B&#8208;atom. First, a library of chiral boron O,N&#8208;complexes was synthesized in diastereoselective fashion. The generated stereoinformation at boron was then transferred via the ate&#8208;complex into the boron C,N&#8208;chelates.Twitter affiliations: @LaschatGroup, @YStoeckl







Abstract
Molecules stereogenic only at tetrahedral boron atoms show great promise for applications, for example as chiroptical materials, but are scarcely investigated due to their synthetic challenge. Hence, this study reports a two&#8208;step synthesis of enantioenriched boron C,N&#8208;chelates. First, the diastereoselective complexation of alkyl/aryl borinates with chiral aminoalcohols furnished boron stereogenic heterocycles in up to 86&#8201;% yield and d.r. &gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;2. Treatment of these O,N&#8208;complexes with chelate nucleophiles was surmised to transfer the stereoinformation via the ate&#8208;complex into the C,N&#8208;products. This chirality transfer succeeded by substitution of the O,N&#8208;chelates with lithiated phenyl pyridine to give boron stereogenic C,N&#8208;chelates in up to 84&#8201;% yield and e.r. up to 97&#8201;:&#8201;3. The chiral aminoalcohol ligands could be recovered after isolation of the C,N&#8208;chelates. The chirality transfer tolerated alkyl, alkynyl and (hetero&#8208;)aryl moieties at boron and could be further extended by post&#8208;modification: transformations such as catalytic hydrogenations or sequential deprotonation/electrophilic trapping were feasible while maintaining the stereochemical integrity of the C,N&#8208;chelates. Structural aspects of the boron chelates were studied by variable temperature NMR and X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Ionic Liquids and Electrolytes with Flexible Aromatic Anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural analogous ionic liquids (ILs) and electrolytes comprising oligoether&#8208;based flexible aromatic anions offer different physicochemical properties. The designed ILs and the electrolytes are fluorine&#8208;free and have better physicochemical properties than conventional electrolytes and have a great potential to be used as electrolytes in next generation batteries, in particular those operating at elevated temperatures and with limited electrochemical stability window.







Abstract
Five new n&#8208;tetrabutylphosphonium (P4444)+ cation&#8208;based ionic liquids (ILs) with oligoether substituted aromatic carboxylate anions have been synthesized. The nature and position of the oligoether chain affect thermal stability (up to 330&#8201;&#176;C), phase behaviour (Tg&lt;&#8722;55&#8201;&#176;C) and ion transport. Furthermore, with the aim of application in lithium batteries, electrolytes were created for two of the ILs by 10&#8197;mol% doping using the corresponding Li&#8208;salts. This affects the ion diffusion negatively, from being higher and equal for cations and anions to lower for all ions and unequal. This is due to the stronger ionic interactions and formation of aggregates, primarily between the Li+ ions and the carboxylate group of the anions. Electrochemically, the electrolytes have electrochemical stability windows up to 3.5&#8197;V, giving some promise for battery application.

         <title>Extended Light Absorption and Improved Charge Separation by Protonation of the Organic Ligand in a Bismuth&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protonation of the nitrogen in the thiazole ring, which acts as the organic ligand of Bi&#8208;based MOF (Bi&#8208;MMTAA), results in a pronounced redshift in light absorption. This protonation also accelerates charge separation and transfer and ultimately improves photocatalytic performance.







Abstract
In this work, a new method to extend the light absorption and improve the photocatalytic activity of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with nitrogen&#8208;containing ligand is reported, namely, the protonation of nitrogen. Specifically, a protonated Bi&#8208;based MOF synthesized by a hydrothermal method (Bi&#8208;MMTAA&#8208;H, MMTAA=2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;4&#8208;methyl&#8208;5&#8208;thiazoleacetic acid) displays a wider visible light absorption than Bi&#8208;MMTAA&#8208;R with the same single&#8208;crystal structure, but synthesized by a reflux method. The redshifted light absorption was confirmed to be caused by the protonation of nitrogen in the thiazolyl ring in MMTAA. Moreover, this protonation also facilitates the charge separation and transfer and improves the photocatalytic activity of selective oxidation of &#945;&#8208;terpinene to p&#8208;cymene. Our results provide a new idea for nitrogen&#8208;containing Bi&#8208;based MOFs to extend the light absorption and improve the photocatalytic performance.

         <title>Tf2O&#8208;Catalyzed Tandem Cyclization/Trifluoromethylselenolation of Alkynes for Synthesis of CF3Se&#8208;Containing Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and practical Tf2O&#8208;catalyzed tandem cyclization/trifluoromethylselenolation of alkynes with EtOH as the green solvent was developed. Various CF3Se&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds, including indoles, benzofurans, benzothiophenes, isoquinolines and chromenes have been synthesized with trifluoromethyl selenoxides as CF3Se source.







Abstract
Herein, the tandem synthesis of various CF3Se&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds has been developed, using Tf2O as the catalyst and trifluoromethyl selenoxides as the electrophilic trifluoromethylselenolation reagents. This process is characterized by its mild conditions, ease of operation, and good functional group compatibility. A variety of alkynes could be transferred into CF3Se&#8208;containing indoles, benzofurans, benzothiophenes, isoquinolines and chromenes in good yields. A key step involving the formation of the electrophilic CF3Se species was proposed.

Various CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Se-containing heterocyclic compounds, including indoles, benzofurans, benzothiophenes, isoquinolines and chromenes have been synthesized with trifluoromethyl selenoxides as CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Se source.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, the tandem synthesis of various CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Se-containing heterocyclic compounds has been developed, using Tf&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O as the catalyst and trifluoromethyl selenoxides as the electrophilic trifluoromethylselenolation reagents. This process is characterized by its mild conditions, ease of operation, and good functional group compatibility. A variety of alkynes could be transferred into CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Se-containing indoles, benzofurans, benzothiophenes, isoquinolines and chromenes in good yields. A key step involving the formation of the electrophilic CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Se species was proposed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and Crystallographic Characterization of Helical Hairpin Oligourea Foldamers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Foldamer hairpin&#8208;like motifs have been prepared by connecting oligourea helices with various alkyl and aralkyl linkers, and their structures were determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Some specific geometrical parameters like interhelical dihedral angles and helical twists were measured, thus allowing precise comparison between the different supersecondary structures. More information can be found in the Research Article by C. Dolain, G. Guichard and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300087). Artwork by Christel Dolain.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Enantiomerically Pure P&#8208;Chiral 1&#8208;Alkoxy&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophospholes via Nucleophilic P&#8208;N Bond Cleavage of a 1&#8208;Phospha&#8208;2&#8208;azanorbornene</title>

One cleavage &#8208; many possibilities: A straightforward one&#8208;pot synthesis of enantiopure P&#8208;chiral 1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophospholes has been established via a nucleophilic P&#8722;N bond cleavage of 1&#8208;phospha&#8208;2&#8208;azanorbornene (PAN). The procedure can be modified to give &#8220;custom&#8208;made&#8221; ligands by selecting various nucleophiles and PAN derivatives to control the steric and electronic properties. Phosphorus(III) compounds derived from this procedure are expected to be effective ligands in asymmetric homogeneous catalysis.







Abstract
The reactive P&#8722;N bond in a racemic mixture of endo&#8208;1&#8208;phospha&#8208;2&#8208;azanorbornene (PAN) (RP/SP)&#8208;endo&#8208;1 is readily cleaved with enantiomerically pure lithium alkoxides followed by protonation to afford diastereomeric mixtures of P&#8208;chiral 1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophosphole derivatives. The isolation of these compounds is rather challenging due to the reversibility of the reaction (elimination of alcohols). However, methylation of the sulfonamide moiety of the intermediate lithium salts and sulfur protection of the phosphorus atom prevent the elimination reaction. The resulting air&#8208;stable P&#8208;chiral diastereomeric 1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophosphole sulfide mixtures can be readily isolated and fully characterized. The diastereomers can be separated by crystallization. The 1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophosphole sulfides are readily reduced with Raney nickel to afford phosphorus(III) P&#8208;stereogenic 1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophospholes with potential use in asymmetric homogeneous transition metal catalysis.
