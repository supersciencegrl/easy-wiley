The Front Cover illustrates a host&#8211;guest adduct between a bis(acridinium&#8208;ZnII porphyrin) molecular tweezer and a tetrapyridyl porphyrin guest. Upon light irradiation, this supramolecular system exhibits an intriguing pattern of tuneable excited state processes, including a rarely observed energy transfer to an emissive charge&#8208;transfer state. More information can be found in the Research Article by V. Heitz, H.&#8208;P. Jacquot&#160;de&#160;Rouville, N. Armaroli, B. Ventura and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202502604).

This schematic illustrates the key research progress in surface modification strategies for Ni&#8208;rich layered NCM cathodes. It highlights various coating approachesincluding conventional oxides, phosphates, fluorides, conductive polymers, composite/hybrid systems, and high&#8208;entropy materialsthat synergistically enhance structural stability, suppress interfacial side reactions, and improve Li+ transport. The figure also emphasizes advanced design concepts such as coreshell structures, gradient doping, and primary&#8208;particle&#8208;level engineering, collectively contributing to ultra&#8208;stable and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Nickel&#8208;rich layered LiNixCoyMnzO2 (NCM, x &#8805;$ \ge $ 0.6) cathodes have been widely used for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), delivering exceptional capacity (&#8805;$( \ge $200 mAh g&#8722;1) and remarkable cost&#8208;efficiency. Nevertheless, structural degradation (e.g., oxygen vacancy formation, transition metal dissolution) and interfacial instability (side reactions) under high&#8208;voltage operation (&gt;$ &gt; $4.3&#160;V) severely limit their cycle life. Recent advances demonstrate that precisely engineered surface coatings can synergistically address these limitations through suppressing parasitic reactions, stabilizing lattice frameworks, and enhancing Li+ transport kinetics. This review provides a multidimensional analysis of coating engineering for NCM cathodes, focusing on the mechanism insights, innovative designs, and synthesis route. Notably, this work emphasizes emerging opportunities within underexplored research areas, specifically artificial intelligence&#8208;enabled coating architectures and sustainable large&#8208;scale synthesis methodologies. By systematically integrating fundamental mechanistic insights with practical engineering perspectives, a robust framework to accelerate the utilization of NCM cathodes as ultra&#8208;stable and safe energy storage systems is established in this review.

Chemical modification of RNA can endow RNA molecules with novel structures and functions. Enzyme&#8208;and light&#8208;mediated chemical modifications are widely employed for RNA engineering; these strategies are hindered by the complex enzymatic environment and the low light penetration. This review summarizes the field of chemical RNA modifications using diverse approaches, including enzyme, light, and synthetic reactions&#8208;mediated strategies. By introducing the advantages and disadvantages of various RNA modification strategies, this review provides a reference for designing and developing novel RNA modifications to achieve efficient, precise, and spatiotemporally specific RNA modification strategies.








ABSTRACT
Chemical modification of RNA can endow RNA molecules with novel structures and functions, enabling broader clinical application potential. RNA chemical modification is a systematic and controllable engineering approach, particularly at the cellular or tissue level, requiring precise modification strategies to reduce off&#8208;target effects and enhance spatiotemporal controllability. Although enzyme&#8208;and light&#8208;mediated chemical modifications are widely employed for RNA engineering, these strategies are hindered by the complex enzymatic environment within cells and the low light penetration. This review summarizes the field of chemical RNA modifications using diverse approaches, including enzyme, light, and synthetic reactions mediated strategies, such as nucleotide incorporation, light&#8208;induced RNA silencing, bioorthogonal RNA modification, post&#8208;transcriptional modification, and deprotection. By introducing the advantages and disadvantages of various RNA modification strategies, this review provides a reference for designing and developing novel RNA modification to achieve efficient, precise, and spatiotemporally specific RNA modification strategies.

         <title>Deprotective Functionalization: An Emerging Concept for Amine Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 4, 23 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
While protecting groups are indispensable in total synthesis to avoid undesired reactivity, installation and removal of protecting groups lead to an increase in the step&#8208;count, cost, waste production and time requirement. One approach tackling these drawbacks is deprotective functionalization, which combines deprotection and postfunctionalization in a single step, utilizing the protecting group to activate the functional group for further transformations.








ABSTRACT
Protecting groups are widely employed in multi&#8208;step syntheses with the goal to downregulate the reactivity of certain functional groups. Their use, while often unavoidable, comes with notable drawbacks including increased costs and waste, as well as typically adding two (nonstrategic) synthetic steps to a given sequence. Moreover, late&#8208;stage deprotection of highly functionalized compounds can pose challenges. We introduced an approach termed deprotective functionalization, allowing for direct conversion of a protected functional group into a new one without requiring a separate deprotection event. Interestingly, in this paradigm the protecting group not only prevents side reactions, but also primes the protected functionality for selective transformations. This article provides a conceptual framework for this approach and discusses related strategies, currently limited to protected amines.

Tuning unusual energy and eT processes in a bis(acridinium&#8208;Zn(II) porphyrin)&#8208;tetrapyridyl porphyrin host&#8208;guest complex.








Abstract
The 1:1 complex of a bis(acridinium&#8208;Zn(II)porphyrin) host and a tetrapyridyl free&#8208;base porphyrin guest shows a remarkable interplay of energy and electron transfer (eT) processes, finely tuned by the solvent polarity or the selection of the photoexcited component. A more polar environment (CH2Cl2) favors uncommon parallel intramolecular and intermolecular eT processes, while in an apolar solvent (toluene) the intermolecular eT process is hampered. Notably, the apolar environment also enables a rare energy transfer process from the porphyrin guest toward the charge&#8208;transfer emissive state of the tweezer host. In total, no less than four different excited states were probed, which can be sketched by an inverted pyramid diagram highlighting directional path selection.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1:1 complex of a bis(acridinium-Zn(II)porphyrin) host and a tetrapyridyl free-base porphyrin guest shows a remarkable interplay of energy and electron transfer (eT) processes, finely tuned by the solvent polarity or the selection of the photoexcited component. A more polar environment (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) favors uncommon parallel intramolecular and intermolecular eT processes, while in an apolar solvent (toluene) the intermolecular eT process is hampered. Notably, the apolar environment also enables a rare energy transfer process from the porphyrin guest toward the charge-transfer emissive state of the tweezer host. In total, no less than four different excited states were probed, which can be sketched by an inverted pyramid diagram highlighting directional path selection.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Oxidation of H2S via P and Transition&#8208;Metal Dual Sites on Polymeric Carbon Nitride</title>

ABSTRACT
The development of catalysts featuring high&#8208;density active sites and superior stability is critical for achieving efficient and selective H2S oxidation. This study systematically investigates the catalytic performance and reaction mechanisms of transition metal&#8208;embedded phosphorus&#8208;doped carbon nitride catalysts (i.e., TM&#8208;P@melon, TM = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) for H2S oxidation using density functional theory calculations. Our calculations identified FeN4&#8208;P@melon and MnN4&#8208;P@melon as the most promising candidates, with Gibbs free energy changes (&#916;G) of &#8722;0.24&#160;eV and 0.07&#160;eV for the potential&#8208;determining step in the selective oxidation of H2S to elemental sulfur, respectively. Anchored TM and P atoms act synergistically to narrow the melon&#8208;CN band gap and enhance O2 adsorption/activation, thereby boosting the catalytic reaction. This work provides fundamental theoretical insights for designing highly efficient and selective H2S oxidation catalysts while elucidating the atomic&#8208;level mechanisms governing the catalytic process.

         <title>Lattice Strain and Electron Modulation in Bimetallic Bi&#8211;Sb Catalysts for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction to Formate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 4, 23 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work designs a bimetallic Bi&#8211;Sb catalyst via lattice strain engineering and electronic modulation for efficient CO2 electroreduction. By introducing localized strain and modulating the electronic structure, Sbdoping enhances CO2 adsorption and increases formate selectivity. The optimal Bi99Sb1 catalyst achieves 99% formate Faradaic efficiency and demonstrates the highest intrinsic activity, demonstrating a dual&#8208;regulation strategy to advance Bi&#8208;based electrocatalysts.








ABSTRACT
The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to valuable chemicals and fuels using bismuth&#8208;based catalysts offers a promising pathway toward achieving carbon neutrality. It is widely acknowledged that lattice strain significantly influences the catalytic performance of electrocatalysts in the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Nevertheless, research dedicated to lattice strain engineering in Bi&#8208;based catalysts, particularly through the introduction of similar elements from the same group, remains limited. In this work, we rationally designed a bimetallic Bi&#8211;Sb catalyst by incorporating Sb into the Bi lattice to induce controlled lattice strain and electronic effects.&#160;The optimized Bi99Sb1 catalyst achieved a peak formate Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 99.4% in a flow cell, maintained FEs above 94.8% over a broad potential window (&#8722;0.6 to &#8722;1.1&#160;V vs. RHE), and exhibited the highest intrinsic activity. In situ characterizations and density functional theory calculations revealed that Sb doping introduced localized lattice strain while modulating the electronic structure of adjacent Bi sites, thereby strengthening CO2 adsorption and activation on Bi active centers, reducing the energy barrier for forming the critical *OCHO intermediate. This work highlights the effectiveness of incorporating neighboring metals to tailor lattice strain in Bi&#8208;based electrocatalysts, providing a feasible strategy to enhance the catalytic performance of Bi&#8208;based electrocatalysts.

         <title>Interpenetrating Polymer Network Eutectogels Derived From Polymerizable Deep Eutectic Solvents for Low&#8208;Temperature Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 4, 23 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel IPN eutectogel fabricated from polymerizable deep eutectic solvent exhibits a freezing point below &#8722;57&#176;C. It integrates high ionic conductivity, robust mechanical properties, and remarkable flexibility, enabling supercapacitors to operate reliably under bending, damage, and extreme low&#8208;temperature conditions down to &#8722;30&#176;C.








ABSTRACT
This study developed a polymerizable deep eutectic solvent (PDES) system composed of H2O, choline chloride, and acrylic acid, which exhibited a freezing point as low as &#8211;57.2&#160;&#176;C. By introducing sodium acetate and carrying out in situ polymerization within a polyacrylamide hydrogel, a high&#8208;performance eutectogel with an interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) structure was constructed. The optimized IPN eutectogel demonstrates outstanding overall properties, including high mechanical strength (tensile stress up to 97.2&#160;kPa) and toughness (fracture elongation of 235%), while maintaining high ionic conductivity (21.4&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#176;C) across a broad temperature range (&#8211;40 to 60&#176;C). Supercapacitors using this eutectogel operate effectively within a 1.2&#160;V voltage window and exhibit ideal electric double&#8208;layer capacitive behavior. They achieve a maximum energy density of 7.10&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1, retain 80% of the initial capacitance after 10,000 cycles, and show stable performance under bending, damage, and low&#8208;temperature (&#8211;30&#160;&#176;C) conditions. These results underscore the material's strong potential for use in flexible and low&#8208;temperature energy storage devices.

We present a new class of heteroleptic Ir(III) complexes incorporating an electron&#8208;rich 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic imine)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (bpy&#8208;NHI) ligand. The bpy&#8208;NHI ligand profoundly alters the redox and photophysical properties, enabling protonation&#8208;controlled excited&#8208;state switching and chloride binding. These results highlight bpy&#8208;NHI as a versatile platform for tunable Ir(III) photosensitizers.








ABSTRACT
We report the design, synthesis, and comprehensive photophysical characterization of a new class of heteroleptic IrIII complexes featuring a strongly electron&#8208;donating 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic imine)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (bpy&#8208;NHI) ligand. The bpy&#8208;NHI ligand was synthesized on a multigram scale via a seven&#8208;step sequence and fully characterized. Reaction with the dimer [Ir(ppy)2Cl]2 afforded the target complex [Ir(ppy)2(bpy&#8208;NHI)]+, whose electronic structure was probed by (spectro)electrochemistry as well as by steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy. Compared to the parent [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]+ complex, the new complex exhibits a significantly altered redox profile, including a novel irreversible oxidation at 0.4&#160;V vs Fc+/Fc and the absence of the typical bpy&#8208;centered reduction, consistent with the strongly electron&#8208;donating nature of the NHI substituents. The high basicity of the NHI substituents enabled modulation of the excited&#8208;state properties via protonation, leading to unusual excited&#8208;state dynamics where the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer state switches between bpy&#8208; and ppy&#8208;based character. In the protonated form, the complex is able to bind chloride ions, which was qualitatively detected by changes in the ground&#8208;state absorption of the complex. These findings establish bpy&#8208;NHI as a powerful and sensitive electron&#8208;rich ligand platform for modulating the photophysical and electrochemical properties of Ir(III) complexes, opening new opportunities for the design of photosensitizers with tailored excited&#8208;state properties.

These findings establish bpy-NHI as a powerful and sensitive electron-rich ligand platform for modulating the photophysical and electrochemical properties of Ir(III) complexes, opening new opportunities for the design of photosensitizers with tailored excited-state properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic Synthesis of Allylic Sulfones Directly From Secondary Alcohols</title>

&#8226; Direct synthesis of useful allylic sulfones.
&#8226; Secondary alcohols: feedstock chemicals
&#8226; Broad substrate scope
&#8226; Excellent selectivity
&#8226; Role of water in catalyst regeneration
&#8226; Green byproducts: H2O and H2








ABSTRACT
Allylic sulfones are valuable structures in bioactive compounds and serve as versatile intermediates in organic synthesis. A selective method for the C&#8211;C coupling of aryl sulfones with secondary alcohols has been developed using a Ru&#8208;SNS pincer catalyst. This transformation enables efficient access to allylic sulfones under mild conditions with broad functional group tolerance. Sensitive moieties, including olefins and pharmaceutically relevant piperazine&#8208;substituted aryl sulfones, are well tolerated. The method demonstrates wide synthetic utility, converting natural product&#8208;derived alcohols such as geraniol, nopol, and perillyl alcohol into corresponding sulfone products in high yield. Mechanistic studies suggest the reaction proceeds via initial dehydrogenation of the secondary alcohol to generate a carbonyl intermediate, followed by nucleophilic addition of a sulfone&#8208;derived carbanion. A subsequent isomerization step furnishes the allylic sulfone. DFT calculations support this pathway and reveal a key role for the water generated during alcohol oxidation. This in situ formed water facilitates both catalyst regeneration and the final isomerization step, functioning as an essential component in the catalytic cycle. This method provides a practical, atom&#8208;economical approach to allylic sulfones with high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity, expanding the toolbox for sulfone chemistry in synthesis and medicinal chemistry applications.

         <title>Large Scale Preparation of Proton Pre&#8208;intercalated &#948;&#8208;MnO2 Positive Material for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 4, 23 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on H&#8314;/Na&#8314; exchange theory, this work presents a scalable method to prepare a layered &#948;&#8208;MnO2 cathode via a simple water treatment of a P2&#8208;Na0.67MnO2 precursor. This scalable method yields positive materials with superior rate capability and cycling stability.








ABSTRACT
Layered &#948;&#8208;MnO2 is regarded as one of the most promising positive materials for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) owing to its unique 2D layered structure, large interlayer spacing, abundant ion storage sites, and eco&#8208;friendly characteristics. However, current synthesis methods such as hydrothermal synthesis, electrochemical deposition, and solution precipitation suffer from various limitations, including safety concerns, low crystallinity, and difficulties in scaling up, which severely hinder their commercial application. Inspired by the H+/Na+ ion exchange mechanism, this study successfully prepares large&#8208;scale &#948;&#8208;MnO2 positive materials using a P2&#8208;type Na0.67MnO2 positive material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries as a precursor, followed by a simple water treatment and ion exchange process. This method is straightforward to implement, and its key steps are based on the already mature industrial preparation route for sodium&#8208;ion battery positives. The ion exchange process requires only water, and the by&#8208;product sodium salts can be recycled, demonstrating strong potential for scalable application. Electrochemical tests reveal that the obtained material exhibits a high specific capacity exceeding 400 mAh/g at 0.1 A/g and an impressive rate capacity of 183 mAh/g at 2.0 A/g. This work proposes a simple and scalable strategy for preparing &#948;&#8208;MnO2, contributing positively to advancing research on the application of aqueous ZIBs.

         <title>Computational Understanding of Catalyst Design: Palladium Pincer Complexes for Carbon Dioxide Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 4, 23 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electronic structure/reactivity relationship in differently designed palladium pincer complexes for carbon dioxide hydrogenation is computationally elucidated, showcasing how hydrogen bonding between the O atom of the carboxylic arm and the base L plays a critical role in the second sphere reactivity by dictating the Pd&#948;+&#8208;O&#948;&#8722; bond polarity which is the site where dihydrogen activation occurs.








ABSTRACT
Experimental catalyst design to promote the hydrogenation of CO2 has led to the synthesis of an efficient tripodal palladium pincer complex. This work presents a computational reading key of the ligand design for efficient transition metal catalysts using palladium pincer complexes as precise representatives. By investigating the electronic structure/reactivity relationship, we demonstrate that all the progressive adjustments of the pincer architecture do not significantly affect the Pd&#8208;L (L = PCy3, PPh3) bond and the electron density rearrangement in the first coordination sphere of the complex. We find a strong Pd&#8208;L bond, where the dispersion energy contribution is substantial, that rules out the previously proposed mechanism involving Pd&#8208;L bond breaking. Mechanisms of H2 activation and CO2 reduction are revisited, which showcase how the secondary coordination sphere plays a critical role in reactivity, strongly affecting the Pd&#8208;O (carboxylic arm) bond polarization due to hydrogen bond formation with the O atom. The catalytically active complex is demonstrated to perform through a stepwise mechanism involving polar addition of H2 across the Pd&#948;+&#8208;O&#948;&#8722; bond and subsequent OH deprotonation by an external base (DBU), forming a Pd&#8208;H hydride complex, which easily reacts with CO2 through an outer&#8208;sphere hydride transfer path.

         <title>Unsymmetrical &#946;&#8208;Fused Blatter Radical Zinc Phthalocyanines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 4, 23 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report the first synthesis of a new class of &#946;&#8208;fused Blatter&#8211;Zn phthalocyanines featuring a persistent radical &#960;&#8208;system, &#960;&#8211;&#960;&#8208;driven crystal packing, and SOMO&#8208;centered redox behavior. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction shows packing motifs dominated by centrosymmetric &#960;&#8208;&#960; dimers. DFT reveals cooperative spin communication, establishing a platform for tunable spin and optical materials.








ABSTRACT
Blatter&#8208;type radicals defy conventional chemical expectations, combining unusual stability with intriguing electronic and magnetic properties. We report the first phthalocyanines fused at the periphery with a Blatter&#8208;type radical, creating an extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated framework. These hybrids merge the characteristic optical and electronic properties of phthalocyanines with a robust, spin&#8208;bearing radical, maintaining remarkable stability under ambient conditions. Spectroscopic, crystallographic, and computational studies reveal their distinctive electronic structure, offering insights into radical &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems.

         <title>Photo and Ultrasound Facilitated the Release of Nitric Oxide From [Ru(NO)(QnCN)(Pro)Cl] Isomers: Synthesis, Cytotoxicity, DNA Binding, and Theoretical Simulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 4, 23 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two pairs of [Ru(NO)(QnCN)(Pro)Cl] enantiomers were synthesized, where QnCN is 8&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;quinolinecarbonitrile and Pro is L&#8208; or D&#8208; proline. The molecular orbitals and spectra of these isomers were assigned using DFT calculations. Both the photo and the ultrasound facilitate the release of NO from complexes in solution. The complexes induce apoptosis in HeLa cells and arrest the cell cycle at the G2/M phase, binding with CT&#8208;DNA in the order: D1&gt; D2&gt; L1&gt; L2.








ABSTRACT
Four isomers of [Ru(NO)(QnCN)(Pro)Cl] (L1, D1, L2, and D2) were synthesized, where QnCN is 8&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;quinolinecarbonitrile and Pro is L&#8208; or D&#8208; proline. Complexes L1 and D1, L2 and D2 are two pairs of Ru&#8208;centered enantiomers. In L1 and D1, the proline is coordinated trans to NO, whereas in L2 and D2 the 8&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;quinolinecarbonitrile is coordinated trans to NO. The electronic absorption spectra, infrared (IR), and Raman spectra of the isomers were experimentally measured and theoretically assigned. Ultrasound induces the release of NO from the complexes in solution more rapidly, with a shorter t1/2 than light does. Moreover, the cytotoxicity of the isomeric complexes against HeLa cells was evaluated; the IC50 values range from 1 to 10 &#181;M, with selectivity indices exceeding 2.8. The complexes induced apoptosis in HeLa cells and arrested the cell cycle at the G2/M phase. Molecular docking analyses have revealed that the complexes interact with DNA via minor groove binding. The unique stereochemical configurations of the four complexes affect their selective binding to CT&#8208;DNA, with DNA binding affinities at 298 K in the following order: D1 &gt; D2 &gt; L1 &gt; L2. This study offers insights into the potential applications of these isomeric nitrosylruthenium complexes.

         <title>Bioinspired Underwater Adhesive With Spontaneous, Rapid, Stable, and Robust Adhesion in Dynamic Water Environment</title>

ABSTRACT
Marine mussels exhibit remarkable adhesive capabilities, providing key inspiration for developing underwater adhesives. However, most existing underwater adhesives fail to replicate the convenient, robust, rapid, and stable adhesion of marine mussels. In this work, we developed a biomimetic underwater adhesive (BMUA) that combines catechol group with solvent&#8208;responsive curing mechanism. BMUA was synthesized via a straightforward one&#8208;step free radical polymerization in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), using methacrylic acid (MA) and N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) as hydrogen bond (H&#8208;bond) components, methyl methacrylate (MMA) as a hydrophobic monomer, and DOPA&#8208;functionalized methacrylate as the adhesive unit. Upon water contact, BMUA undergoes solvent exchange rapidly, triggering the formation of a H&#8208;bond and hydrophobic crosslinked network. This process effectively displaces interfacial water and enables solidification, resulting in strong underwater adhesion. The BMUA demonstrates high adhesive strength on various substrates under flowing water and maintains robust bonding stability across a range of pH, salinity, and temperature conditions. Notably, BMUA retains efficient adhesion (&gt;1.4&#160;MPa) even after 45 days and shows promising performance in practical applications such as underwater sealing, targeted bonding, and rapid hemostasis in a rat liver injury model. This work offers a new design strategy for high&#8208;performance underwater adhesives that closely mimic the advantageous adhesion of marine mussels.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Shifting Tetralactam Macrocycles: Protonation&#8208;Activated Convergent Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 4, 23 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shape&#8208;shifting tetralactam macrocycles with embedded pyridinedicarboxamide switches undergo reversible protonation&#8208;triggered reorganization to toggle between low&#8208; and high&#8208;affinity binding states. The protonated form exhibits &gt;10&#8309;&#8208;fold enhanced binding for BrIBr&#8722; via convergent hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions.








ABSTRACT
Integrating high binding affinity with dynamic, stimuli&#8208;responsive control represents a pivotal objective in synthetic receptor design, with far&#8208;reaching implications for sensing, separation, and molecular machinery. We report a class of shape&#8208;shifting tetralactam macrocycles featuring embedded 2,4&#8208;pyridinedicarboxamide units as switching elements. In their neutral state, these macrocycles adopt divergent hydrogen&#8208;bonding conformations that exhibit low substrate affinity. Upon protonation, a reversible conformational reorganization occurs, reorienting four amide N&#8211;H groups toward the cavity to form a convergent, high&#8208;affinity hydrogen&#8208;bonding pocket. Conformational switching was confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography and solution&#8208;phase NMR. Upon protonation, these macrocycles exhibit &gt;10&#8309;&#8208;fold binding enhancement, achieving association constants up to 135,000 M&#8722;1 for the polyhalide anion BrIBr&#8722;. Computational analysis reveals that this dramatic increase arises from synergistic hydrogen bonding, electrostatic attraction, and van der Waals interactions. These findings establish a robust strategy for designing adaptive hydrogen&#8208;bonding receptors that combine dynamic switching with high substrate affinity and selectivity. The ability to toggle between low&#8208; and high&#8208;affinity states without sacrificing structural integrity sets the stage for expanding the scope of smart molecular systems with tunable recognition properties.

         <title>Measurement and Analysis of Vibronic Coupling in Two Dysprosium(III) Complexes of Opposite Magnetic Anisotropy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 4, 23 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;crystal far&#8208;infrared magnetospectroscopy is used to reveal magnetic anisotropy and vibronic coupling in a pair of dysprosium(III) complexes.








ABSTRACT
The loss of magnetic memory in single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) is caused by the coupling of molecular vibrations to spin states, which plays a significant role in magnetic relaxation processes. Gaining direct evidence of vibronic coupling using experimental techniques is critical to understanding and controlling this phenomenon. Most studies focus on assessing the spin&#8208;phonon coupling in SMMs to help control this relaxation; herein we gain insight by comparing the SMM [Dy(OPCy3)2(H2O)5][CF3SO3]3.2(OPCy3)&#160;to the non&#8208;SMM [Dy{N(SiMe3)2}3]&#160;through collection of far&#8208;infrared magnetospectroscopy (FIRMS) spectra and validation with ab initio calculations. Single&#8208;crystal measurements display a prominent feature in the spectra at 340 cm&#8722;1, corresponding to an electronic excitation which varies depending on the direction of external magnetic field applied. These findings demonstrate the complicated effect of magnetic anisotropy on the vibronic coupling in SMMs and demonstrate the power of FIRMS to study these effects.

         <dc:description>
Nature's evolutionary processes have equipped organisms with complex structures to thrive in harsh environments. This study examines their structural characteristics and fog&#8208;collection mechanisms, utilizing interfacial tension theory to uncover key principles, while reviewing advancements in bio&#8208;inspired surfaces. By addressing current challenges and suggesting future directions, it seeks to advance the practical implementation of next&#8208;generation fog&#8208;collection systems.








ABSTRACT
Nature showcases extraordinary wisdom through the creation of diverse species, with plants and animals evolving complex adaptive structures to survive in extreme environments.

         <title>One Cell at a Time: Single&#8208;Entity Impact Electrochemistry for Bacterial Counting and Functional Profiling</title>

SEIE transforms stochastic bacterial collisions into quantitative readouts of counting, metabolism, and secretion. This concept outlines the governing impact physics, mediator&#8208;gated metabolic access, and secretion&#8208;resolved strategies that together define the current analytical landscape.








ABSTRACT
Single&#8208;bacterium analysis is increasingly important because population&#8208;averaged assays can obscure functional heterogeneity that governs pathogenicity, metabolic adaptation, and treatment response. Single&#8208;entity impact electrochemistry (SEIE) provides a complementary measurement paradigm by recording discrete current transients when individual cells stochastically collide with a polarized ultramicroelectrode. The resulting waveform observables (event frequency, charge, duration, and polarity) form a quantitative language that links near&#8208;electrode transport, cell&#8211;electrode contact physics, and engineered electrochemical reporting mechanisms to biological state. In this concept, we present a mechanism&#8208;guided view of SEIE for bacterial analysis, organized by increasing analytical depth: (i) bacterial counting framed explicitly as impact physics, where waveform families, electrode bias, and transport regimes determine calibration and interpretability; (ii) exogenous redox mediators as selectors that define metabolic access points and transient signatures for single&#8208;cell electron&#8208;transfer metrology; and (iii) secretion&#8208;resolved SEIE using endogenous reporters or engineered transducers to interrogate native metabolic outputs, stress responses, and interspecies interactions. We conclude by outlining key challenges and opportunities for translation, including operation in complex media, antifouling, and standardization, higher&#8208;throughput platforms, multimodal integration, and automated waveform analysis for point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing and antimicrobial susceptibility testing.

         <title>Photoelectrochemical Hydrogen Peroxide Production via Simultaneous Reduction and Oxidation Processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an important chemical substance and also a promising carbon&#8208;free clean fuel. The design of a sophisticated photoelectrochemical (PEC) reaction system enables the solar&#8208;driven H2O2 production through simultaneous water oxidation and oxygen reduction processes (H2O2/H2O2&#8208;PEC cells). This review focuses on the H2O2/H2O2&#8208;PEC cells that can achieve Faraday efficiencies exceeding 100% for H2O2, emphasizing the relationship between electrode material properties and cell performances.








ABSTRACT
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an essential substance in chemistry and chemical industry, while being a clean fuel. Currently, research into green and sustainable processes for producing H2O2 is progressing rapidly, with the aim of replacing the energy&#8208;intensive anthraquinone process used in industrial production. Among them, the photoelectrochemical (PEC) method is one that has attracted much attention, because it allows for the solar&#8208;driven production of H2O2 from only water and oxygen. Furthermore, highly designed PEC cells enable the simultaneous production of H2O2 at the anode and cathode (H2O2/H2O2&#8208;PEC cells). This review article focuses on the H2O2/H2O2&#8208;PEC cells having the potential to achieve a Faraday efficiency (&#951;) exceeding 100% for H2O2, with an emphasis on the relationship between electrode materials properties and cell performances. The H2O2/H2O2&#8208;PEC cells can be classified into two types: one involving water oxidation reaction and oxygen reduction reaction (WOR/ORR), and a more recently developed type involving oxygen reduction reaction at both electrodes (ORR/ORR). Based on the fundamental principles of the H2O2/H2O2&#8208;PEC cells, we discussed the electrode material design, and then review some cutting&#8208;edge research on the WOR/ORR&#8208; and ORR/ORR&#8208;PEC cells. Finally, we summarize the conclusions, and outline challenges and perspectives in this hot topic.

         <title>Tetrametallic Terbium/Europium Fluorenylphosphonate With Excellent X&#8208;Ray Scintillating and Photo&#8208;Induced Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetranuclear lanthanide fluorenylphosphonate clusters Eu4 and Tb4, together with chemically mixed Eu/Tb analogues (c&#8208;EuxTb4&#8722;x, where x&#160;=&#160;2.67, 2, 1.33) and physically mixed Eu/Tb materials (p&#8208;yEu4:zTb4, with y:z&#160;=&#160;2:1, 1:1, 1:2), were successfully synthesized. Eu4 and Tb4 exhibit exceptional X&#8208;ray scintillation performance. The luminescence of both c&#8208;EuxTb4&#8722;x and p&#8208;yEu4:zTb4 can be effectively modulated by precisely&#8208;tuning the Eu3+:Tb3+ stoichiometric ratios.








ABSTRACT
This work reports two lanthanide clusters, [Ln4(RPO3)2(RPO3H)(tBuCO2)7(tBuCO2H)3(H2O)3] (Ln&#160;=&#160;Eu, Tb; RPO3H2 denotes (9&#8208;methyl&#8208;9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phosphonic acid). A comprehensive series of characterizations was performed for the Eu4 and Tb4 clusters, including X&#8208;ray crystallography, X&#8208;ray scintillation, and photoluminescence spectroscopy, to elucidate their structural features and physicochemical properties. Notably, these clusters exhibit exceptional X&#8208;ray scintillation performance, attributed to the characteristic luminescence of Ln3+ ions. This finding paves the way for the development of novel scintillator materials and enriches the family of lanthanide&#8208;bearing clusters with X&#8208;ray scintillating properties. Furthermore, photoluminescence modulation was achieved for the chemically mixed Eu/Tb analogues, c&#8208;EuxTb4&#8208;x (x&#160;=&#160;2.67, 2, 1.33), and physically mixed Eu4/Tb4 materials, p&#8208;yEu4:zTb4 (y:z&#160;=&#160;2:1, 1:1, 1:2), with varying the excitation wavelength. Notably, near&#8208;white&#8208;light emission is realized for p&#8208;Eu4:2Tb4 upon excitation at 365&#160;nm. Collectively, these tetranuclear lanthanide phosphonates exhibit excitation&#8208;wavelength and Eu3+:Tb3+ ratio dependent luminescence, indicating their potential as color&#8208;tunable luminescent materials and white&#8208;light&#8208;emitters.

         <title>Simple Access to a Series of Higher Substituted Pentafluoroorthotellurate&#8208;Based Silanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pentafluoroorthotellurate ligand was introduced to organo silanes. A variety of silanes with the formular RxSi(OTeF5)4&#8211;x were synthesized and characterized via spectroscopic techniques and sc&#8208;XRD. The influence of the number of OTeF5 groups on structural properties as well as the fluoride ion affinities (FIA) has been studied and compared to other silanes bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents.








ABSTRACT
The preparation and characterization of RxR&#8242;ySiOTeF5 (R&#160;= Me, Et, iPr, Ph; x&#160;= 3, y&#160;= 0; R&#160;= Pr, tBu, R&#8242;&#160;= Me; x&#160;= 1, y&#160;= 2; 1a&#8208;1f), R2Si(OTeF5)2 (R&#160;= Me, Et, iPr, Ph; 2a&#8208;2d) and RSi(OTeF5)3 (R&#160;= Me, Et, tBu, Ph; 3a&#8208;3d) by reaction of the corresponding chlorosilane and an OTeF5 transfer reagent is presented. Molecular structures in the solid state were obtained for Ph3SiOTeF5 (1f), Ph2Si(OTeF5)2 (2d) and tBuSi(OTeF5)3 (3c). Furthermore, the Lewis acidity was assessed by calculating the fluoride ion affinity (FIA), leading to the observation that a higher number of pentafluoroorthotellurate groups results in an increased FIA.

         <title>Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Route for Covalent Cellulose Fiber Dyeing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a proof of concept for a chemo&#8208;enzymatic approach to the covalent dyeing of cotton fibers. Laccase/TEMPO oxidation introduces aldehyde groups, enabling subsequent reductive amination with amino dyes. Excellent color homogeneity and wash fastness were demonstrated using acid red 33, highlighting the robustness of the approach and its potential relevance for dyeing applications.








ABSTRACT
The conventional textile dyeing process, based on reactive dyes, allows covalent dye fixation but requires toxic or hazardous chemicals that raise significant environmental pollution and health concerns. In this study, we present a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, two&#8208;step chemo&#8208;enzymatic process for grafting aminated dyes onto cotton surfaces. Our aim is to demonstrate the feasibility of covalent dye attachment, while noting that full sustainability has yet to be achieved. First, cotton fibers are oxidized using the laccase/TEMPO system to introduce carbonyl groups, which then react with the amino group of dyes to form C&#8208;N bond through reductive amination. Reductive amination of laccase&#8208;oxidized cotton threads was achieved with rhodamine 123 and acid red 33. Covalent dyeing was evidenced by LC&#8208;MS analyses of hydrolysates obtained after cellulase action. The process was successfully transferred to cotton fabrics, and acid red 33 showed excellent color uniformity and fastness. By comparing results with different dyes (acid red 266, acid violet 19, acid black 41, and acid blue 25), useful criteria to guide dye design were identified. Our study presents a chemo&#8208;enzymatic approach to covalent cotton dyeing and offers insights into the future development of dyes.

         <title>Programming the Optoelectronic Properties of Atomically Precise Gold Nanoclusters Using the Conformational Landscape of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
The rational design of hybrid nanomaterials with precisely controlled properties remains a central challenge in materials science. While atomically precise gold nanoclusters (Au&#8208;NCs) offer molecule&#8208;like control over a metallic core, tuning their optoelectronic behavior via surface engineering is often empirically driven. Here, we establish a design principle by demonstrating that the conformational landscape of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDP) can be used as a programmable scaffold to rationally modulate the photophysical properties of a covalently bound Au&#8208;NC. We synthesized a series of bioconjugates between Au25 nanoclusters and bioengineered IDPs containing a variable number of cysteine anchoring points. A combination of mass spectrometry, small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, and modeling on the conjugates indicates that increasing the number of covalent anchors systematically restricts the conformational ensemble, inducing a progressively more compact protein shell around nanoclusters. This structural rigidification at the interface directly translates into a 15&#8208;fold enhancement of the Au&#8208;NC near&#8208;infrared photoluminescence and a six&#8208;fold increase in its average lifetime. Our findings demonstrate that the conformational plasticity of IDPs and the capacity to engineer them can be harnessed as a molecular tuning knob, moving to a new regime of programmable soft&#8208;matter control over the properties of quantum&#8208;confined nanomaterials for tailored biotechnological applications.

         <title>Isocyanide Incorporation Expands the Anticancer Potential of Diiron(I) Aminocarbyne Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Facile incorporation of cyclohexyl and 4&#8208;methoxyphenyl isocyanides into diiron aminocarbyne complexes generates amphiphilic, aqueous&#8208;stable structures. The compounds exhibit potent cytotoxicity across a panel of cancer cell lines in both 2D and 3D models, with NTERA&#8208;2 cells being particularly sensitive, while retaining significant selectivity for malignant over normal cells.








ABSTRACT
Diiron(I) bis&#8208;cyclopentadienyl complexes with a bridging aminocarbyne ligand feature an organometallic scaffold with established anticancer potential. Aiming to expand the structure&#8208;activity relationships, seven new compounds were synthesized by incorporating isocyanide ligands: [Fe2Cp2(CO)(CNFc)(&#956;&#8208;CO){&#956;&#8208;CNMe(R)}]CF3SO3 (Fc&#160;= [Fe(Cp)(&#951;5&#8208;C5H4)], R&#160;= Me, 2a; cyclohexyl&#160;= Cy, 2b; p&#8208;methoxyphenyl&#160;= Anis, 2c; Cp&#160;= &#951;5&#8208;C5H5) and [Fe2Cp2(CO)x(CNR&#8242;)(1&#8208;x)(&#956;&#8208;CO){&#956;&#8208;CNMe(R)}]CF3SO3 (R&#160;= Cy, R&#8242;&#160;= Anis, x&#160;= 1, 3b or x&#160;= 2, 4b; R&#160;= Anis, R&#8242;&#160;= Cy, x&#160;= 1, 3c or x&#160;= 2, 4c). The products were isolated in 70%&#8211;85% yields and characterized by IR, NMR spectroscopy, and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction in one representative case. They display submillimolar water solubility, amphiphilic or moderately lipophilic character, and remarkable inertness in physiological&#8208;like solutions. While the ferrocenyl derivatives 2a&#8211;c exhibited only modest activity, 3 and 4 displayed potent cytotoxicity across a panel of six cancer cell lines, with IC50 values in the low micromolar range in most cases and in the nanomolar range for the NTERA&#8208;2 testis cell line. Moreover, 3b&#8211;c showed significant selectivity toward cancer cells and, along with 4b&#8211;c, retained a remarkable cytotoxic effect in 3D cell spheroids. Complexes 3b&#8211;c were effective in targeting cellular TrxR and increasing cellular ROS production.

         <title>Tuning the Electronic Structure and ROS Generation of BiOCl via Salt&#8208;Mediated Precipitation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple precipitation of the BiOCl photocatalyst in a presence of different metal and metalloid salts result in a broad range of effects on its final properties. Crystal growth, facet exposition, spontaneous formation of substitutional defects, deposition of surface species, optical properties, and ability for the photocatalytic reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation were all affected, many of them being described for the first time.








ABSTRACT
Herein, we investigated how the introduction of different metal salts during the synthesis of bismuth oxychloride affects its electronic structure, revealing that the nature of the metal salt plays a key role in determining the resulting&#160; properties. Several species (Mo, Se, W, V, Ti, Mn, Hg, and Pb) were added to affect the precipitation of the BiOCl photocatalysts. Prepared samples were investigated concerning their crystal structure, elemental composition, morphology, surface area, and optical properties, which were discussed considering possible effects of Bi substitution from the density functional theory calculations. Ti and Hg influence only the crystal growth and morphology. Mo, W, and V, as metallates, shift the absorption to the visible region, but the resulting photocatalytic activity was hindered. Pb2+ and Mn2+ ions substitute for Bi, acting as acceptor defects. Moreover, MnCl2 lead to significant crystal growth and formation of well&#8208;defined {100}, {110}, {101}, and {111} facets. The BiOCl:Mn sample shows increased activity, connected with conduction band (CB) shift and enhanced O2 reduction to &#8729;O2&#8722;. Introduction of SeO32&#8722;&#160;deposits Se4+/S0 species on the surface, leading to the formation of smaller, well&#8208;defined rectangular BiOCl crystals. Surface selenium&#160;acts as electron traps, increasing the charge carriers lifetime and promoting 2&#8208;electron reduction of O2 to H2O2.

         <title>Surficial N+ Charge Density as Key Factor for Inhibition of Pseudomonas Biofilm Formation in Non&#8208;Leaching Quaternary Ammonium&#8208;Modified Polydimethylsiloxane Coatings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biological fouling threatens marine ecosystems and infrastructures, demanding sustainable solutions. We designed PDMS materials functionalized with quaternary ammonium&#8208;based silanes that inhibit biofilm formation of a highly resilient Gram&#8208;negative Pseudomonas strain. A critical surface charge threshold was identified beyond which adhesion is suppressed. This strategy offers durable and environmentally friendly protection.








ABSTRACT
Marine biofouling represents significant environmental and economic concerns, highlighting the need for sustainable and non&#8208;leaching antifouling materials. In this work, we developed cross&#8208;linked polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) coatings functionalized with methyldimethoxysilanes bearing quaternary ammonium groups and alkyl side chains of two different lengths (C8 and C12). 29Si and 13C solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (CP&#8208;MAS NMR) and Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) confirmed the successful incorporation of silanes into the polymer matrix. Surface analysis was carried out by fluorescein assay, surface roughness, and contact angle measurements. Antifouling assays against Pseudomonas delhiensis PS27, a robust Gram&#8208;negative strain exhibiting strong resilience to environmental stresses, demonstrated notable biofilm inhibition in coatings with higher charge surface density without affecting the physiological fitness of planktonic cells. An observed minimum effective value of surface charge density (6.23 &#177; 0.76)&#183;1016 N+/cm2 for biofilm inhibition was observed. These findings suggest a link between surficial N+ charge density and antifouling efficacy. The developed coatings represent a promising and durable strategy for environmentally friendly fouling prevention in marine and aquatic environments.

         <title>Copper(II), a Peculiar Metal Ion for Complexation with Monensin A Ionophore</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper(II) forms three chiral and EPR&#8208;active complexes with monensinate A in methanol. Beside the bis [CuL2] and mono [CuL]+ species, the new dinuclear construct [Cu2L]3+ exhibits an [ML]+&#8208;type and a metal salt&#8208;type copper(II) centers weakly bound to each other through counter ion(s) and thus, being magnetically independent.








ABSTRACT
Monensin A transports Na+ ions through the cell membrane, but it is also able to bind divalent metal ions potentially influencing the biological activity of the ionophore. In line with our previous studies, here we explored interaction of the essential Cu(II) with monensinate A and suggested the types of coordination compounds formed. Circular dichroism (VIS&#8208; and NIR&#8208;CD), VIS light absorption, and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopies, as well as electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) were utilized for identification and characterization of the complexes. Bis or mono Cu(II) complexes prevailed at ligand excess or comparable reactant concentrations, respectively. Excess Cu(II) salt, however, induced the formation of dinuclear coordination species, not observed previously with divalent metal cations as Mg(II), Ca(II), Co(II), Mn(II), Ni(II), Zn(II). The dinuclear complex is EPR&#8208;active being a rare example of non&#8208;EPR&#8208;silent coordination compounds containing two Cu(II) centers and is the first case among the known metal(II) complexes of the antibiotic monensin A. The origin of the counterion did not influence the properties of the bis compound but contributed to the spectral behavior of the newly detected dinuclear Cu(II) species. This study revealed that the interactions of a drug molecule with metal(II) ions during its practical application may be significant and it should be considered in discussions about the mechanism of action.

ABSTRACT
A PPh2Me&#8208;promoted [4 + 3] annulation between benzo[c][1,2]dithiol&#8208;3&#8208;ones and quinazoline&#8208;derived azomethine imines for the facile synthesis of a novel quinazoline&#8208;fused benzothiadiazepine library is described. This transformation is characterized by its mild conditions and excellent functional group tolerance, affording 25 novel tetracyclic compounds in excellent yields (most &gt;85%). The biological evaluation of the obtained tetracyclic products established the scaffold's promising preliminary anti&#8208;TNBC profile. The lead compound, 3ma, further demonstrated potent anti&#8208;migratory effects in wound healing and transwell assay, suggesting anti&#8208;metastatic potential. Preliminary mechanistic insights from molecular docking studies indicated binding affinity to the EGFR kinase active site, which provides a testable hypothesis for the mechanism of action.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective C&#8211;C Silylation of Cyclopropyl Acetates Harnessing Fluorinated Poly(pyridyl)Borate Rhodium Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorinated poly(pyridyl)borates have been utilized to stabilize rhodium&#8208;diene complexes and as supporting ligands in rhodium&#8208;catalyzed redox&#8208;neutral C&#8211;C silylation of cyclopropyl acetates, producing silicon&#8208;containing heterocyclic products, dioxasilolanes.








ABSTRACT
Rhodium complexes supported by fluorinated tris&#8208; and bis&#8208;(pyridyl)borates effectively catalyze redox&#8208;neutral C&#9472;C silylation of cyclopropyl acetates, producing the umpolung, silicon&#8208;containing heterocyclic products, dioxasilolanes, in good yields with high regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. The enhanced performance arises from the weakly donating ability of the fluorinated ligands, along with the considerable steric bulk of the poly(pyridyl)borates, which together govern both reactivity and selectivity. Additionally, rhodium(I)&#8208;cyclooctadiene and rhodium(I)&#8208;norbornadiene complexes supported by poly(pyridyl)borate ligands have been isolated and characterized. X&#8208;ray crystal structures show that in these square planar complexes, poly(pyridyl)borate ligands bind to rhodium in a &#954;2&#8208;mode using two&#8208;pyridyl arms, while the cyclic dienes coordinate in an &#951;4&#8208;fashion.

The enhanced performance arises from the weakly donating ability of the fluorinated ligands, along with the considerable steric bulk of the poly(pyridyl)borates, which together govern both reactivity and selectivity. Additionally, rhodium(I)-cyclooctadiene and rhodium(I)-norbornadiene complexes supported by poly(pyridyl)borate ligands have been isolated and characterized. X-ray crystal structures show that in these square planar complexes, poly(pyridyl)borate ligands bind to rhodium in a &#954;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-mode using two-pyridyl arms, while the cyclic dienes coordinate in an &lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>Cyanobacterial Cyclic Peptides Containing cis&#8208;Pro Conformation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyanobacterial cyclic natural products are ribosomal or nonribosomal peptides, typically containing one or more proline residues. However, the presence and population of the cis&#8208;Pro conformation are not always explicitly stated in the literature. The two proline isomers can affect protein function and interactions. This review focuses on the NMR characteristics and biosynthetic logic of cyanobacterial cyclic peptides containing cis&#8208;Pro dominant conformations, aiming to provide an overview of the cis&#8208;Pro conformations in cyanobacterial cyclic peptides.








ABSTRACT
More than 3,000 natural products have been identified from cyanobacteria. These natural products often displayed antiparasitic, anti&#8208;inflammatory, antimicrobial, and anticancer activities. Cyanobacterial cyclic natural products are ribosomal or nonribosomal peptides, typically containing one or more proline residues. However, the presence and population of the cis&#8208;Pro conformation are not always explicitly stated in the literature. The two proline isomers can affect protein function and interactions. This review focuses on the NMR characteristics and biosynthetic logic of cyanobacterial cyclic peptides containing cis&#8208;Pro dominant conformations, aiming to provide an overview of the cis&#8208;Pro conformations in cyanobacterial cyclic peptides. We manually reviewed the chemical structures and NMR chemical shifts of 150 cyanobacterial cyclic peptides containing proline residues, of which 51 cyclic peptides possessed cis&#8208;prolyl amide bonds. Furthermore, we explained the Pro cis/trans isomerism in cyclic peptides and discussed methods for better studying these Pro cis/trans conformations in the future.

         <title>Molecules and Linear Polymers With Incorporated Pillar[5]Arene Units: Enhanced Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission and Their Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a unique class of macrocyclic compounds, pillararenes have garnered significant attention from researchers due to their exceptional performance in complexing with AIEgens. This concept aims to consolidate recent research advancements and applications of pillararene&#8208;AIEgens systems, offering valuable insights for future investigations.








ABSTRACT
Pillar[n]arenes are a class of special macrocyclic compounds with rigid and porous structures, representing an important branch of host macrocycles in the field of supramolecular chemistry. Since their discovery in 2008, pillar[n]arenes have been in&#8208;depth applied in the field of biomedicine, such as molecular recognition, bio&#8208;imaging, and tumor detection, due to the enhancement of fluorescent signal when combining with chromophores. Over the past decade, many pillar[n]arene units&#8208;incorporated polymers have been synthesized and served as ideal polymer hosts for the enhancement of luminescent performance of applied to enhance aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) performance. Driven by researchers' keen exploration of pillararene polymers for AIE enhancement, this review will elaborate on the AIE&#8208;enhancing effects of pillararenes from two aspects: pillararene&#8208;containing monomers and pillararene&#8208;containing linear polymers. It also introduces the synthesis methods of pillararenes and the principles underlying their AIE&#8208;enhancing effects. Additionally, their applications in areas such as fluorescent sensing and artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems are presented. Finally, the current challenges and prospects of pillararenes are discussed.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Selective and Chemical Activation Strategies for Nitrogen Mustard Prodrugs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
Nitrogen mustards are highly potent DNA&#8208;alkylating agents, but their clinical utility is limited by systemic toxicity and poor tumor selectivity. Tumor&#8208;selective prodrug strategies have emerged to address these challenges, enabling spatiotemporally controlled activation of otherwise inert precursors. These approaches exploit tumor&#8208;specific cues such as hypoxia, acidic pH, elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS), and redox imbalance, to achieve precise payload release. Stimulus&#8208;induced bond cleavage or structural transformation liberates the masked nitrogen mustard (NM) in situ, facilitating targeted DNA cross&#8208;linking. This review highlights molecular design principles underlying diverse activation strategies, emphasizing scaffold modifications and linker chemistries tailored to cancer&#8208;associated triggers. We also discuss integration with advanced delivery platforms, including polymeric carriers and nanoplatforms, to enhance tumor accumulation and therapeutic indices while minimizing off&#8208;target toxicity. By consolidating recent advances, this review illustrates how bioorthogonal and tumor&#8208;selective activation strategies, including those responsive to hypoxia, ROS, and pH, are redefining the precision oncology potential of NM prodrugs.

         <title>Structural Aspects of Lithium&#8208;Ion Conduction in the Phosphidotitanate Li8TiP4 and Its Comparison With Li7+5xTa1&#8722;xP4 and Li8&#8722;xTi1&#8722;xTaxP4</title>

ABSTRACT
The chemical system Li/Ti/P has previously been subject to intensive investigation. However, reliable structural data for the reported phases have remained elusive. Motivated by the growing interest in phosphorus&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion conductors, we have reinvestigated the synthesis, crystal structure, and physical properties of Li8TiP4. Phase pure Li8TiP4 was obtained, which crystallizes in the tetragonal space group P42mc (no. 105) with a&#8201;=&#8201;8.37581(2)&#8201;&#197; and c&#8201;=&#8201;5.90489(2)&#8201;&#197;. According to a structure determination from X&#8208;ray diffraction powder data, Li8TiP4 is closely related to known Li8TtP4 with Tt&#8201;=&#8201;Si, Ge, and Sn, but adapts a different structure type. Basic structural findings are confirmed by solid state 6Li and 31P NMR spectroscopy. DFT calculations reveal a band gap of 2.5&#8201;eV and a good correlation between theoretical and experimental Raman spectra. From potentiostatic impedance spectroscopy an ion conductivity of (4.3&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.6)&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8722;6&#8201;S&#8729;cm&#8722;1 at 298&#8201;K was found. In addition to the investigation of ternary Li8TiP4, an isotypic quaternary Ta&#8208;containing phase is observed and studied by single crystal structure determination. Special emphasis in this study is placed on the role of Li occupancy in the voids of the cubic close&#8208;packed (ccp) P atom arrangement and its impact on the ionic conductivity, in comparison to the known compounds Li7+5xTaxP4 and Li8&#8722;xTi1&#8722;xTaxP4 and traced back to the difference in crystal symmetry. Possible diffusion pathways of the Li+ ions were approached by BVSE calculations.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Induced Sequestration of Oxoanions: Detoxification of Cr(VI) and Immobilization of TcO4&#8722; at ppb Level in Aqueous Systems</title>

A guanidinium&#8208;based redox&#8208;active porous organic polymer (POF&#8208;3) enables the selective removal of carcinogenic chromate and radioactive pertechnetate from water below their WHO safety limit. The incorporation of a thiophene moiety facilitates Cr(VI) reduction to Cr(III), while the guanidium moiety facilitates electrostatic interactions and ion exchange governs oxoanions binding.








ABSTRACT
Metal oxoanions present significant challenges because of their high solubility in water and their charge characteristics. Among these, carcinogenic chromate and radioactive pertechnetate are particularly concerning. Conventional adsorbents often suffer from low recyclability and reduced selectivity to remove oxoanionic pollutants. Herein, we report a guanidinium&#8208;based porous organic polymer (POF&#8208;3) that selectively adsorbs CrO42&#8722;and TcO4&#8722; from real&#8208;life water samples. POF&#8208;3 displays maximum adsorption capacities of 123&#160;mg g&#8722;1 for chromate and 177&#160;mg g&#8722;1 for perrhenate at pH&#160;=&#160;6. The removal efficiency of POF&#8208;3 at low concentrations of chromate and pertechnetate is very far below the corresponding EPA limit. The adsorption mechanism mainly follows electrostatic interaction and the ion exchange mechanism. Reducing carcinogenic Cr(VI) to Cr(III) is a crucial step; introducing thiophene in the structural backbone of POF&#8208;3 facilitates the redox properties. Morphological transformation into a sheet&#8208;like structure confirms the effective sorption of chromate and perrhenate. In this context, NMR titration of monomeric compound also suggests interaction of POF&#8208;3(M) with guanidium sites of material towards chromate and perrhenate effectively, as proven by solid phase study. These effective adsorption capacities, faster kinetics, and ion exchange ability make it a promising solution for environmental remediation.

         <title>Making and Breaking: Supramolecular Chirality Modulation via Stepwise Assembly and Disassembly of Nano&#8208;Size Trizinc(II)Porphyrin Trimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work demonstrates the induction of chirality in a nano&#8208;size achiral trizinc(II) porphyrin trimer (host) through sequential addition of chiral diamino esters (substrates, L) through the stepwise formation of polymer and dimer via intermolecular assembling and disassembling processes, respectively.








ABSTRACT
A molecular&#8208;level understanding of supramolecular chirality amplification and attenuation is established through the coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of a &#8216;nano&#8208;size&#8217; achiral Zn(II)porphyrin trimer (host) and a series of chiral diamino esters (substrates). The processes occur through the stepwise formation of polymer and dimer via intermolecular assembling and disassembling processes, respectively. Crystallographic characterizations of both the polymer and dimer allow systematic scrutiny of their structural changes, elucidating their chiroptical properties. The electronic circular dichroism (CD) spectra display opposite signs for the R and S substrates in both the polymer and dimer, indicating that the chirality of the complexes are dictated solely by the absolute configuration of the substrate. In the dimer, both intra&#8208; and intermolecular couplings were identified while in the polymer, CD signals were significantly amplified, owing to cumulative intermolecular couplings. DFT and TDDFT studies corroborate these experimental findings and provide valuable insights into the origin of the chiroptical responses, amplification and reduction in these systems.

         <title>Copper&#8208; and Silver&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions of Active Methylene Isocyanides: Facile Access to Highly Substituted Five&#8208; and Six&#8208;Membered Heterocycles</title>

         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent advances in copper&#8208; and silver&#8208;catalyzed reactions of active methylene isocyanides for the synthesis of highly substituted five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered heterocycles. Emphasis is placed on [3+n] cycloadditions, annulations, and asymmetric strategies, highlighting current limitations and future opportunities in heterocycle construction.








ABSTRACT
Copper&#8208; and silver&#8208;catalyzed reactions of active methylene isocyanides provide powerful and versatile strategies for the construction of heterocyclic architectures relevant to pharmaceutical and materials science. Owing to their unique ambiphilic reactivity, active methylene isocyanides serve as key building blocks for the synthesis of fused, bicyclic, polycyclic, and spirocyclic heterocycles under mild catalytic conditions. This review summarizes recent advances in the copper&#8208; and silver&#8208;catalyzed transformation of functionalized isocyanides toward multi&#8208;substituted five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered heterocyclic frameworks. Particular emphasis is placed on [3+n] cycloaddition reactions, as well as tandem processes involving cycloaddition, annulation, alkylation, and insertion pathways. In addition, emerging strategies that exploit nonfunctionalized isocyanides, strained alkene surrogates, and multi&#8208;isocyanide reaction manifolds are discussed, highlighting new opportunities for complexity generation and asymmetric heterocycle synthesis.

         <title>Rational Design Strategies for Stimuli&#8208;Responsive DNAzymes Using Modified and Artificial Nucleotides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activity control of RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes in response to external stimuli has attracted growing interest for applications in DNA&#8208;based diagnostics, therapeutics, and dynamic DNA nanotechnology. This review summarizes rational design strategies for stimuli&#8208;responsive DNAzymes using modified or artificial nucleotides, including split and caged DNAzymes, as well as systems that undergo stimuli&#8208;induced structural transformations.








ABSTRACT
DNA, traditionally regarded as genetic material, has emerged as a versatile building block in molecular technology. Catalytic DNA oligomers known as DNAzymes, especially those capable of cleaving target RNA at specific sites, have shown great potential in DNA&#8208;based diagnostics, therapeutics, and dynamic DNA nanotechnology. For advanced applications, stimuli&#8208;responsive DNAzymes, which are activated only under specific conditions or by specific chemical stimuli, have attracted particular attention. Although such DNAzymes can be obtained by in vitro selection under strictly controlled conditions, more general strategies for their rational design are strongly needed. In this approach, stimuli&#8208;responsiveness is introduced into existing DNAzymes by sequence engineering or chemical modification. This review focuses on the rational design of stimuli&#8208;responsive RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes using modified and artificial nucleotides. Here, we discuss representative strategies, including recent examples: (i) stimulus&#8208;induced reconstitution of split DNAzymes, (ii) activity control by strand cleavage or ligation, (iii) blocking of the catalytic core with removable oligonucleotides, (iv) caging with labile protecting groups, and (v) stimuli&#8208;induced conformational switching between inactive and active structures. These approaches enable externally controllable activation mechanisms, while maintaining the intrinsic catalytic activity of DNAzymes, providing a valuable toolkit for molecular sensing and DNA nanotechnology.

         <title>Operando Magic Angle Spinning Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy of Methanol Photoreforming Over Titania&#8208;Coated Silica Monoliths</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoreforming of methanol is followed in real time by solid&#8208;state Magic Angle Spinning NMR. The transparent sapphire sample holder is irradiated by four LEDs at 11.5&#160;kHz MAS. Efficient light penetration into the sample volume is ensured by silica monoliths with a network of macropores, coated with TiO2, and enhancing light penetration by a factor of two. Silica monoliths may be a versatile support for photo&#8208;irradiated operando solid&#8208;state NMR.








ABSTRACT
Solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy under Magic Angle Spinning (MAS) is one of the most powerful analytic techniques and in principle the method of choice to elucidate with molecular detail all components of complex solid or solid&#8208;liquid samples. MAS NMR under light irradiation is yet little developed, with technical solutions and first applications just emerging. We present the first operando observation of photoreforming of methanol to formaldehyde in a transparent rotor, irradiated at 365&#160;nm by four LEDs, at spinning rates up to 11.5&#160;kHz. The photon flux inside the rotor is quantified by an actinometric reaction. Efficient light penetration into the entire rotor volume is crucial. Therefore, we introduce silica monoliths with a continuous network of macropores, coated with TiO2 (anatase) as supported heterogeneous catalyst. These monoliths provide a large pore volume to accommodate the liquid substrate and a high surface area. Centrally, the network of pores larger than the visible light enhances light penetration into the material by a factor of two compared to a powder. Silica monoliths may be easily decorated with various photocatalysts and thus provide a versatile platform for observing in real time photocatalytic reactions by solid&#8208;state NMR.

We present the first &lt;i&gt;operando&lt;/i&gt; observation of photoreforming of methanol to formaldehyde in a transparent rotor, irradiated at 365&#160;nm by four LEDs, at spinning rates up to 11.5&#160;kHz. The photon flux inside the rotor is quantified by an actinometric reaction. Efficient light penetration into the entire rotor volume is crucial. Therefore, we introduce silica monoliths with a continuous network of macropores, coated with TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (anatase) as supported heterogeneous catalyst. These monoliths provide a large pore volume to accommodate the liquid substrate and a high surface area. Centrally, the network of pores larger than the visible light enhances light penetration into the material by a factor of two compared to a powder. Silica monoliths may be easily decorated with various photocatalysts and thus provide a versatile platform for observing in real time photocatalytic reactions by solid-state NMR.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mini&#8208;Hairpin DNA: Extraordinarily Stable Structure and Its Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mini&#8208;hairpin DNA fragments containing GCGAAGC and GCGAAAGC form exceptionally stable hairpin&#8208;like structures, with only two G&#8722;C pairs and one sheared G&#8722;A pair, remaining undenatured in 7&#160;M urea and resisting nuclease digestion. These mini&#8208;hairpin sequences frequently appear in replication and transcription origins, influence DNA sequencing fidelity, and are applicable for stabilizing versatile nucleic acid functional molecules.








ABSTRACT
Nucleic acids exhibit diverse biological functions through hierarchical structural organization, and higher&#8208;order architectures enable recognition beyond Watson&#8208;Crick base pairing. Here, we describe the discovery and characterization of an unusual, extraordinarily stable motif&#8212;mini&#8208;hairpin DNA&#8212;a compact hairpin structure composed of GCGNNAGC or GCGNAGC sequences (N = A, G, C, or T). About 40 years ago, we serendipitously found this unique structure from unusual mobility in denaturing gel electrophoresis. The tertiary structure of GCGAAGC was determined by NMR and contains two G&#8722;C pairs and one sheared G&#8722;A pair. Despite only three base pairs, the mini&#8208;hairpin structure remains nondenatured even in 7&#160;M urea. This thermal stability cannot be accounted for by conventional thermodynamic or structural models and remains unexplained by current molecular dynamics predictions. In addition to thermal stability, this motif resists nuclease digestion. The motif has been identified not only in certain genomic contexts but also as a stabilizing element in engineered nucleic acids, where it enhances the performance of functional nucleic acid molecules. We hope that this review will accelerate further research and applications of mini&#8208;hairpin DNA.

         <title>Recent Advances in Chemical Probing Strategies for RNA Structure Determination in Vivo</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review illustrates how structural probes combined with advanced sequencing technologies are revolutionizing our ability to map RNA structures and interactions within living cells. It highlights the development of innovative strategies tailored to probe RNA structures in particular biological contexts.








ABSTRACT
The intricate structures of RNA molecules facilitate their diverse cellular functions. These structures are shaped by the cellular environment, a context that in silico and in vitro methods typically cannot reconstitute, making it more difficult to study the structure of RNA in cells. In response to these challenges, RNA structure probing using cell&#8208;permeable chemicals has emerged as an effective method to capture the RNA structural landscape in its native environment. The integration of these probes with advanced adduct detection techniques, particularly second&#8208; and third&#8208;generation sequencing, has propelled the field forward, facilitating a deeper understanding of the RNA structurome within its precise functional context, including the examination of RNA structure at the single&#8208;molecule and single&#8208;cell levels, within specific subcellular compartments, and across various stages of RNA biogenesis and regulation. This Review summarizes the significant advances in the field of RNA structure probing, focusing on the development of novel structural probes, strategies for RNA structure reconstruction, innovative methodologies that offer extended applicability to address unique biological questions, and concludes with an outlook on future directions in the field.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Phenylation From [13C6] and [2H5]Benzene: A Versatile Tool for Stable Isotope Labeled MS Standards</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









ABSTRACT
We explored aryl thianthrenation as a tool for directly incorporating multiple isotopes into molecular scaffolds starting from full isotopically labeled benzene. Stable isotope&#8208;labeled (SIL) molecules are indispensable tools for investigating chemical and biological mechanisms and quantifying metabolites. However, the late&#8208;stage incorporation of isotopically labeled benzene remains challenging and under&#8208;investigated. This challenge stems from the direct functionalization of non&#8208;substituted benzene, which remains a difficult task. The approach described in this work is based on sulfonium salts used as a source of [13C6] and [2H5]benzene under palladium catalysis conditions. This approach demonstrates its efficiency in C&#9472;C and C&#9472;S bond formation with different substrates. Additionally, this methodology was employed for the synthesis of poly&#8208;substituted [13C6]benzene derivatives.

This concept review delves into the foundational principles, mechanistic insights, and synthetic applications of H&#8208;EDA complexes in radical chemistry, and forward&#8208;looking perspectives on the future research trajectories of this field.








ABSTRACT
Electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complexes have emerged as powerful tools in radical chemistry, enabling diverse transformations under mild conditions. Among various EDA models, hydrogen&#8209;bonding EDA (H&#8208;EDA) complexes, which utilize hydrogen&#8209;bonding interactions to facilitate electron transfer between donors and acceptors, have attracted considerable attention in recent years. Owing to their unique advantages, broad substrate compatibility, tunable selectivity, and environmental friendliness, H&#8209;EDA complexes represent promising candidates for advancing the fields of radical photochemistry and synthetic chemistry. This concept review delves into the foundational principles, mechanistic insights, and synthetic applications of H&#8208;EDA complexes in radical chemistry, and forward&#8208;looking perspectives on the future research trajectories of this field.

         <title>Self&#8208;Controlled Automated Strategy for the Synthesis of Gold Nanorods With Fine&#8208;Tuned Longitudinal Absorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes an innovative strategy which allows to synthesize precisely tuned gold nanorods starting from nonpurified dispersions with variable aspect&#8208;ratio. The etching process is under direct control and can be stopped at any time by oxidizer quenching, providing stable dispersions.



ABSTRACT
Reproducibility is the main weak point of most of the currently available synthetic strategies for metal nanostructures, and this issue is hampering both production and research on such materials. While several synthetic strategies can be found in literature, most of them are fundamentally based on strict protocols consisting of lists of subsequential predefined operations to be executed in a time&#8208;defined manner. Such protocols are designed and optimized on the basis of pilot runs and are intrinsically affected by noncontrollable fluctuations in the experimental conditions. In this work an innovative, intrinsically flexible, automatized, and self&#8208;correcting strategy is proposed, which, in combination with real&#8208;time monitoring of the optical properties of the reaction mixture, allows to synthesize precisely tuned gold nanorods. This strategy is based on the fast and precisely controlled oxidation of precursor AuNRs. The fast reaction allows the selective and predictable etching of the nanorods by online&#8208;controlled subsequential additions of small amounts of oxidants, which are also able to remove undesirably shaped byproducts possibly present in the sample. Due to these features, this process can be automated and allows starting from nonpurified nanorod dispersions with variable aspect&#8208;ratio. Furthermore, the reaction can be stopped by oxidizer quenching, providing stable dispersions.

         <title>Carbon Dioxide&#8208;Mediated Chemical Processes in Aqueous Solutions</title>

CO2 in water operates as a tunable electrophilic switch, inducing reversible pH and ion speciation changes that modulate nucleophilic reactivity and soft&#8208;matter structure, influencing material properties. This Perspective highlights how CO2&#8208;responsive aqueous systems and smart polymers enable controllable reactions, separations, and capture processes in water&#8208;based technologies.








ABSTRACT
The physical and chemical behavior of CO2 is key to understanding the ubiquity of inorganic carbon, which includes atmospheric CO2, dissolved CO2 in surface waters, and precipitated and mineralized carbonate in sediments and rock formations. These complex equilibria contribute to the global carbon cycle, inspiring novel CO2 applications. Because water is crucial in these equilibria, a comprehensive overview of CO2 reactivity in aqueous systems can help us to design and enhance the efficiencies of various artificial CO2&#8208;mediated processes. Here, we discuss the role of CO2 in responsive processes in, on, and with water, ranging from catalysis and organic synthesis to materials, surfactants, and carbon capture methods. These concepts are necessary for developing innovative smart materials, drug delivery systems, stimuli&#8208;controlled catalysis, novel environmental remediation processes, and new CO2 capture materials. We rationalize these recent examples in terms of mod of action of CO2 to recapitulate this rapidly developing field.

         <title>Crystal Engineering on Cu&#8208;Triazolate MOFs via Mixed&#8208;Linker Modulation for Selective Azeotropic Ethanol Dehydration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modification of Cu&#8208;triazole metal&#8211;organic framework is demonstrated through a mixed&#8208;linker approach, providing a hydrophilic pore with open&#8208;metal Cu&#8208;sites. The framework is highly selective to water adsorption from an azeotropic mixture of water&#8211;ethanol. The enhanced framework's hydrophilicity and porosity are key to success in the improved performance for liquid&#8208;phase ethanol dehydration.








ABSTRACT
A mixed&#8208;linker synthetic strategy was employed to engineer the morphology of copper&#8211;triazolate metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Cu&#8208;Tz MOFs) through controlled crystal growth. By incorporating amino&#8208; and thioether&#8208;functionalized triazole alongside the parent triazole linkers, the framework's hydrophilicity, pore cavity, and surface chemistry were systematically modulated. Upon thermal activation, the resulting mixed&#8208;linker MOFs revealed accessible Cu(II) open metal sites, together with enhanced hydrophilicity and porosity within the framework. These features synergistically contribute to superior water removal performance from azeotropic water&#8211;ethanol mixtures, outperforming the parent CuTz in separation efficiency.

         <title>Air&#8208;Stable 2,2&#8242;&#8208;Azobispyridine Radical&#8211;Boron Complexes and Their Near&#8208;Infrared Absorption Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Air&#8208;stable 2,2&#8242;&#8208;azobispyridine radical&#8211;boron complexes were synthesized via one&#8208;electron oxidation of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;hydrazobispyridine precursors. The bulky and electron&#8208;withdrawing B(C6F5)2 group effectively stabilized the radicals. ESR and DFT studies confirmed spin&#8208;delocalization over the 2,2&#8242;&#8208;azobispyridine &#960;&#8208;framework and N&#9472;N bond contraction upon oxidation. These radical complexes exhibited near&#8208;infrared absorption.








ABSTRACT
Air&#8208;stable nitrogen&#8208;centered radicals are of great interest as building blocks for functional molecular materials. In this study, we developed 2,2&#8242;&#8208;azobispyridine radical&#8211;boron complexes that exhibit near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption. The complexes were synthesized by introducing boron substituents into 2,2&#8242;&#8208;azobispyridine frameworks, followed by one&#8208;electron oxidation to generate the corresponding radical species. The B(C6F5)2 derivatives were successfully isolated as air&#8208; and water&#8208;stable solids, whereas the BF2 and B(n&#8208;Bu)2 analogues could not be obtained. Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy revealed broad isotropic signals with g &#8776; 2.00, indicating that the unpaired electron is delocalized over the 2,2&#8242;&#8208;azobispyridine core. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations supported this delocalization and reproduced the observed structural changes, including a N&#9472;N bond shortening upon oxidation. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of the methoxy&#8208;substituted complex confirmed these structural features. The radical complexes displayed NIR absorption with &#955;max values of 800&#8211;1140&#160;nm, depending on the substituents. These findings demonstrate that boron complexation effectively stabilizes 2,2&#8242;&#8208;azobispyridine radicals and enables precise tuning of their optical properties, providing a promising design principle for NIR functional dyes and radical&#8208;based materials.

         <title>A Tandem Chemical Vapor Deposition Platform for the Solvent&#8208;Free Synthesis of Polypeptide Architectures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solvent&#8208;free, two&#8208;step chemical vapor polymerization enables efficient, substrate&#8208;independent synthesis of surface&#8208;attached polypeptide films. Initiator deposition via CVD is followed by NCA ring&#8208;opening polymerization. Characterization confirms film formation and functionalization, allowing precise micropatterning and bioactive surface design for biomedical and industrial applications.








ABSTRACT
The precise engineering of surfaces decorated with polypeptides is critical for advanced diagnostics, biomedical coatings, and cellular interfaces. However, conventional methods are plagued by the need for solvents, multistep procedures, substrate limitations, and the abundance of side reactions. Here, we report that two&#8208;step chemical vapor polymerization can result in the fast, efficient, and substrate&#8208;independent synthesis of polypeptide films without the use of solvents or excipients. The first step involves deposition of an initiator layer, i.e., poly(4&#8208;amino&#8208;p&#8208;xylylene), via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) polymerization of 4,16&#8208;diamino[2.2]paracyclophane. The second step involves evaporation and ring&#8208;opening polymerization of N&#8208;carboxy anhydrides. This fully integrated CVD approach ensures substrate&#8208;independent, conformal growth of poly(propargyl&#8208;(S)&#8208;glycine) and poly(O&#8208;propargyl&#8208;(S)&#8208;tyrosine) films of up to 198&#160;nm thickness. The use of CVD processes eliminates the concern of side reactions, such as transfer and termination reactions, and is a prerequisite for the successful peptide micropatterning, demonstrated in this study. Successful peptide growth and post&#8208;polymerization modifications via click chemistry were confirmed by time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary mass spectrometry, x&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and infrared spectroscopy. The application of entirely solvent&#8208;free workflows to develop biomacromolecular coatings, such as the polypeptide films demonstrated in this study, addresses a critical gap in the pursuit of advanced and scalable biologization methods.

         <title>Upconversion Luminescence of Molecular Lanthanide Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the recent advances in upconversion lanthanide complexes varying from structural design to luminescent properties. They are classified into mononuclear lanthanide complexes, ion&#8208;paired lanthanide complexes and polynuclear lanthanide complexes, according to the structural characteristics.








ABSTRACT
Upconversion luminescence (UCL) materials based on the molecular lanthanide complexes have garnered increasing attention in diverse frontier fields in recent years. Compared with the intensively investigated lanthanide&#8208;doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), the development of UCL lanthanide complexes needs strengthening, especially considering the controllable synthesis and flexible architecture characteristics of lanthanide complexes. In this review, we overview the recent advances in UCL lanthanide complex, varying from structural design to luminescent properties. The challenges remaining and future prospects for UCL lanthanide complex are also discussed. We hope that the review will bring more inspirations and possibilities for developing the field of molecular UCL.

         <title>Synergistic Sm,Fe Co&#8208;Doping in NiO Nanoparticles on Carbon Nanofibers Boosts Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sm,Fe co&#8208;doped NiO nanoparticles anchored on interconnected carbon nanofibers (Sm,Fe&#8208;NiO/CNFs) were developed to synergistically enhance OER activity and stability through Sm&#8208;induced electronic state engineering and oxygen vacancy engineering.








ABSTRACT
Nickel oxide (NiO) electrocatalysts suffer from inevitable oxidative degradation during alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER), where irreversible phase transitions compromise structural integrity and long&#8208;term stability. Herein, the Sm,Fe co&#8208;doped NiO nanoparticles anchored on interconnected carbon nanofibers (denoted as Sm,Fe&#8208;NiO/CNFs) was proposed as highly efficient and stable OER catalyst. By employing rare earth (RE) Sm doping to stabilize low&#8208;valence Ni sites and generate oxygen vacancies (VO) through charge compensation, the Sm,Fe&#8208;NiO/CNFs exhibits exceptional OER activity, with a low overpotential of only 274&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, which is superior to that of Fe&#8208;NiO/CNFs (280&#160;mV) and RuO2 (333&#160;mV). Besides, Sm,Fe&#8208;NiO/CNFs also has robust long&#8208;term stability and satisfying selectivity (nearly 100% Faradic efficiency). Using Sm,Fe&#8208;NiO/CNFs as the anode in a water&#8208;splitting electrolyzer, it operates at a low potential of just 1.51&#160;V to achieve 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, making it a promising candidate for water splitting applications. It was discovered that Sm doping offers electron donation to Ni active sites in Fe&#8208;NiO to stabilize the Ni&#9472;O bonds, preventing over&#8208;oxidation and dissolution of metal species, and thus contributing to the significantly improved OER activity and long&#8208;term stability of the catalyst.

         <title>AgBF4&#8208;Induced Site&#8208;Selective Synthesis of 4&#8208;Sulfonylindoles in Au&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization&#8208;Sulfonyl Migration Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Site&#8208;selective synthesis 4&#8208;suflonylindoles was achieved by a cyclization&#8208;rearrangement strategy by &#960;&#8208;Lewis acidic gold catalysts and the aid of silver cocatalyst. Particularly, the use of 3 equivalents of AgBF4 to SPhosAuCl is crucial for C4&#8208;selective migration of the sulfonyl group.








ABSTRACT
The reactions of ortho&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;N&#8208;arenesulfonylanilines in the presence of SPhosAuCl (2&#160;mol %) and AgBF4 (6&#160;mol %) produced the corresponding 4&#8208;sulfonylindoles in good yields with satisfactory site&#8208;selectivity at the C4&#8208;position of the indole ring. This reaction proceeded via cyclization followed by sequential [1,2]&#8208;rearrangement of the sulfonyl group. The selective migration of the sulfonyl group to the C4&#8208;position was induced by using an excess amount of AgBF4 relative to the gold catalyst to form a dinuclear Au&#9472;Ag complex to decelerate the migration to C3&#8208;position. Furthermore, the tetrafluoroborate anion with its suitable gold affinity and hydrogen bonding characteristics, plays a crucial role in enabling selective migration to the C4&#8208;position.

         <title>Synthesis and Self&#8208;Assembly of Perylene Imide&#8208;Containing Hydrophilic Polymers in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores recent advances in the synthesis and design of perylene imide&#8208;functionalized hydrophilic polymers and their self&#8208;assembly in aqueous media. We highlight how molecular and supramolecular engineering drive the formation of functional, water&#8208;borne nanostructures, and identify the remaining challenges, which limit currently their broader application.








ABSTRACT
New advances in synthetic strategies have greatly expanded the structural diversity of perylene imides (PIs), increasing the tunability of their molecular properties and assemblies in organic solvents. More recent studies also show molecular assemblies in aqueous media when the hydrophobic perylene core is functionalized with hydrophilic groups, allowing their use not only in optoelectronics or catalysis, but also in biological applications. However, PIs are usually too hydrophobic to be used in water, and their molecular assemblies usually result in ill&#8208;defined nanostructures with a significant loss of their emissive properties. Therefore, a powerful and promising strategy to enhance PI solubility in water is to incorporate them into hydrophilic polymer chains. Compared to small hydrophilic groups, the length and architecture of the polymer can be controlled and adapted to modulate the nanostructure morphology while preserving the perylene's properties in water. This review summarizes the current literature on the self&#8208;assembly in water of PI&#8208;based hydrophilic polymers, with a focus on their synthesis and the different parameters that influence the self&#8208;assembly and properties of the materials.

         <title>Polydopamine&#8208;Mediated Grafting of Cationic Polymer Brushes for Adsorption of Fluorinated Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce a versatile approach to fabricate tunable charged interfaces by functionalizing stonewool fibers with a polydopamine (PDA)&#8211;quaternary amine coating via a grafting&#8208;to method. The modified surfaces exhibit rapid, concentration&#8208;dependent adsorption of anionic species driven by electrostatic interactions.








ABSTRACT
Understanding the adsorption behavior of charged molecular species at functionalized polymer interfaces is critical for advancing surface science and material design. Building upon recent advances in polydopamine (PDA)&#8208;mediated polymer grafting, we investigated electrostatic adsorption at cationic polymer brush surfaces. Using a grafting&#8208;to approach, we covalently attached poly(2&#8208;trimethylammonioethyl methacrylate chloride) (PTMAEMA) to PDA&#8208;coated stonewool fibers and characterized the resulting charged interface via x&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). We employed perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) as a model anionic adsorbate to investigate binding at a quaternary amine&#8208;functionalized surface. Batch equilibrium sorption studies revealed concentration&#8208;dependent adsorption kinetics, achieving three times higher binding affinity for PTMAEMA&#8208;functionalized fibers at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 5.0&#160;g&#160;L&#8722;1, with equilibrium reached within 10 min. XPS analysis confirmed the successful surface functionalization with distinct nitrogen environments at 395.5&#160;eV (PDA) and 398.5&#160;eV (quaternary nitrogen), while thermogravimetric data indicated an organic loading of close to 28%. Our findings demonstrate that PDA&#8208;mediated polymer grafting provides a versatile platform for creating well&#8208;defined charged interfaces with tunable adsorption characteristics, and provides a methodology to explore fundamental adsorption phenomena at polymer&#8208;liquid interfaces.

         <title>Conformation&#8208;Variable [7]Annulenyl Radicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[7]Annulenyl radicals exhibit substituent&#8208;dependent conformations, affecting different spin distribution and chemo&#8208;stability. The dibenzo&#8208; analogues show more planar geometry and longer persistency than the tribenzo&#8208; variants due to more effective &#960;&#8208;conjugation.








ABSTRACT
A series of benzo&#8208;fused [7]annulenyl radical derivatives are synthesized and studied. By comparing their spin distribution differences revealed by EPR, variable molecular structures adaptive to steric features around the [7]annulenyl moiety are unveiled. Specifically, for radicals having no substituent on the vinylene carbons (C10 &amp; C11), a relatively planar dibenzo[a,d][7]annulenyl skeleton containing a delocalized spin is suggested by both experimental data and computation results. Depending on the substituting group on C5, decent to optimal persistency is observed, as represented by a half lifetime of 23&#160;h displayed by a triisopropylphenyl&#8208;substituted radical in air&#8208;saturated solution. When a substituent is added to C10, the radical stability can be further improved, although the [7]annulenyl framework becomes slightly bended. However, the tribenzo[a,c,e][7]annulenyl radicals exhibit noticeably inferior stability attributed to the nonplanar conformation assumed by the tetracyclic scaffold, which not only curbs the spin delocalization by disrupting the &#960;&#8208;conjugation, but also makes the molecule more susceptible to various spin&#8208;annihilation reactions. More interestingly, when an anthryl group is attached to C9 of tribenzo[a,c,e][7]annulenyl, a pronounced conformational transition to folded state is observed, with the spin concurrently relocated from the tribenzo[7]annulenyl moiety to 9,10&#8208;anthrylene unit, presumably driven by the superior spin delocalization property.

By comparing their spin distribution differences revealed by EPR, variable molecular structures adaptive to steric features around the [7]annulenyl moiety are unveiled. Specifically, for radicals having no substituent on the vinylene carbons (C10 &amp;amp; C11), a relatively planar dibenzo[&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;][7]annulenyl skeleton containing a delocalized spin is suggested by both experimental data and computation results. Depending on the substituting group on C5, decent to optimal persistency is observed, as represented by a half lifetime of 23&#160;h displayed by a triisopropylphenyl-substituted radical in air-saturated solution. When a substituent is added to C10, the radical stability can be further improved, although the [7]annulenyl framework becomes slightly bended. However, the tribenzo[&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;][7]annulenyl radicals exhibit noticeably inferior stability attributed to the nonplanar conformation assumed by the tetracyclic scaffold, which not only curbs the spin delocalization by disrupting the &#960;-conjugation, but also makes the molecule more susceptible to various spin-annihilation reactions. More interestingly, when an anthryl group is attached to C9 of tribenzo[&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;][7]annulenyl, a pronounced conformational transition to folded state is observed, with the spin concurrently relocated from the tribenzo[7]annulenyl moiety to 9,10-anthrylene unit, presumably driven by the superior spin delocalization property.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Study on the Directional Synthesis of Bi2S3 Induced by Graphene and the Mechanism of Pseudocapacitive Kinetics Regulation at the Interface</title>

ABSTRACT
To address the issues of capacity decay and poor rate performance of Bi2S3 anode materials, which are caused by their intrinsically low conductivity and significant volume expansion during cycling, this study adopts a redox self&#8208;assembly strategy. Under mild hydrothermal conditions, oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups on the surface of graphene oxide (GO) induce the directed growth of Bi2S3 along the [001] crystallographic direction, successfully constructing a Bi2S3/GO composite anode with strong interfacial coupling. This structure effectively suppresses the agglomeration of Bi2S3 nanorods, forms a 3D conductive network, alleviates volume strain, and avoids structural damage caused by traditional high&#8208;temperature sulfidation processes. Electrochemical tests show that the 1.0&#8208;Bi2S3/GO composite retains a capacity of 300 mAh&#183;g&#8722;1 after 100 cycles at a current density of 100 mA&#183;g&#8722;1. At a high rate of 5000 mA&#183;g&#8722;1, it still exhibits a reversible capacity of 198.62 mAh&#183;g&#8722;1, and after current recovery, the capacity rapidly increases to 439 mAh&#183;g&#8722;1, with a capacity retention rate exceeding 70%. The lithium&#8208;ion diffusion coefficient reaches 8.7&#215;10&#8722;12 cm2&#183;s&#8722;1, which is 2.8 times higher than that of the pure phase. Mechanistic analysis reveals that the characteristic peak (&#964; = 0.3 s) in the distribution relaxation time (DRT) relaxation spectrum corresponds to the pseudocapacitive behavior on the GO surface, with a contribution rate of 58% at a scan rate of 2 mV&#183;s&#8722;1, significantly optimizing the ion storage dynamics at the interface. Additionally, the built&#8208;in electric field at the interface facilitates charge transfer, effectively shortening the relaxation time. The synergistic &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking buffering network further enhances structural stability and reaction reversibility. This study, through the &#8220;directed growth&#8208;pseudocapacitance regulation&#8208;relaxation matching&#8221; triple mechanism, provides new insights for the design of high&#8208;performance sulfide&#8208;based anodes.

         <title>SmI2/Sm&#8208;Induced Reductive Silacyclization of Alkene/Diene Derivatives Using Dichlorosilanes or 1,2&#8208;Dichlorodisilanes via Reductive Radical&#8208;Polar Crossover</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A SmI2/Sm&#8208;mediated silacyclization unlocks a concise route to 4&#8211;7&#8208;membered silacycles from simple unsaturated substrates and dichlorosilanes/disilanes. The complementary functions of samarium reductants trigger a reductive radical&#8211;polar crossover, offering a versatile strategy for constructing multiple Si&#9472;C bonds efficiently.








ABSTRACT
The development of efficient strategies for constructing cyclic organosilicon frameworks is considered of great importance because of their structural diversity and synthetic utility. Herein, we report a SmI2/Sm&#8208;mediated silacyclization of unsaturated organic compounds with readily available dichlorosilanes and &#8208;disilanes, enabling convenient access to 4&#8722;7&#8208;membered silacyclic compounds. Mechanistic investigations indicate that the reaction involves silyl radical intermediates and proceeds via a reductive radical&#8208;polar crossover (RRPCO) pathway. The present findings showcase the broad potential of Sm reagents in Si&#9472;C bond formation, providing a versatile strategy for constructing diverse silicon&#8208;containing frameworks.

         <title>Evolution of the Total Synthesis of Gregatin A and Related Natural Products</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From deceptively simple monomers to architecturally complex dimers, this review traces the evolution of synthetic strategies to gregatin A and its dimeric congeners. Advances in asymmetric and biomimetic synthesis reveal how modern tactics unravel the structure, reactivity, and biosynthetic logic of this fungal polyketide family.








ABSTRACT
The gregatins constitute a distinctive family of fungal metabolites exhibiting notable phytotoxic and antimicrobial activities, which have attracted sustained interest from the synthetic community since their discovery. Despite their deceptively simple molecular architectures, the structural elucidation and asymmetric synthesis of gregatins have long remained challenging. Among them, gregatin A serves as the prototypical member and a proposed biosynthetic precursor to several dimeric congeners, including penicilfuranone A, asperones A and B, and citrifurans A and D. Over the past decades, remarkable progress has been achieved in the total and asymmetric synthesis of these compounds, reflecting the continuous evolution of synthetic strategies toward greater efficiency, selectivity, and biomimetic relevance. This review summarizes the methodological innovations and strategic advances that have shaped the total synthesis of gregatin A and its structurally related dimers, highlighting the broader conceptual evolution of asymmetric synthesis in complex natural product chemistry.

         <title>Induced&#8208;Fit Recognition by a Calixarene&#8211;Pyrene Conjugate for Single&#8208; and Dual&#8208;Wavelength Fluorescence Sensing in Water</title>

A sulfonatocalix[4]arene&#8211;pyrene conjugate functions as a fluorescence chemosensor for the optical detection of biorelevant analytes in water. Its photoinduced electron transfer (PET) response is triggered by an induced&#8208;fit recognition mechanism. Noncovalent assembly with an additional dye affords dual&#8208;color ratiometric signaling via competitive PET.








ABSTRACT
The discovery of fluorescence receptors that selectively bind small molecules with high affinity in aqueous media is critical for the development of new sensing and bioimaging assays. We herein report a new fluorescence receptor&#8208;dye chemosensor based on the monofunctionalization of p&#8208;sulfonatocalix[4]arene (SC4) receptor with pyrene (SC4&#8208;4Py). The SC4&#8208;4Py conjugate was found to retain the exceptional binding properties of SC4, allowing the high&#8208;affinity recognition of neurotransmitters, amino acids, and biogenic amines in aqueous solution and their optical detection. The SC4&#8208;4Py chemosensor operates through a photoinduced electron transfer (PET) mechanism triggered by conformational changes in the calixarene structure upon binding, allowing single&#8208;wavelength fluorescence detection of target analytes and its expansion into a dual&#8208;wavelength ratiometric indicator displacement assay (IDA) that relies on competitive PET between the pyrene and non&#8208;covalently bound lucigenin dye.

         <title>Bis&#8208;Dichlorosilyl Functionalized C4&#8208;Cumulene With Unique Bonding Scenario</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Herein, we report a silylene&#8208;functionalized C4&#8208;cumulene (2) and investigate its bonding scenario employing computational methods such as NBO analysis, AIM, and energy decomposition analysis&#8208;natural orbital for chemical valence (EDA&#8208;NOCV). The EDA&#8208;NOCV analysis showed that compound 2 prefers to possess electron&#8208;sharing covalent sigma and dative covalent sigma bonds (Si&#8596;C and C&#8594;Si) between Ph2C4 fragment in the anionic doublet state and silyl&#8208;amidine groups in cationic doublet state. This may be due to the electron&#8208;deficient nature of olefin and electron&#8208;rich N&#8208;donating functional groups on silicon atoms. Compound 2 displays unprecedented chemical bonding in this class of compounds as predicted by EDA&#8208;NOCV calculations. We have also compared the bonding situation of compound 2 with a previously reported compound 3.








ABSTRACT
This work reports the preparation and computational investigation of a bis&#8208;dichlorosilyl functionalized C4&#8208;cumulene (2), which was synthesized by employing Amidinato&#8208;chlorosilylene, L(Cl)Si: (L = PhC(NtBu)2). Compound 2 was characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, mass spectrometry, and NMR spectroscopy. The stability, distribution of spin densities, and the nature of Si&#8208;C bonds of 2 were studied by employing natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis, atoms in molecules (AIM), and energy decomposition analysis&#8208;natural orbital for chemical valence (EDA&#8208;NOCV). The EDA&#8208;NOCV analysis showed that compound 2 possesses electron&#8208;sharing covalent sigma and dative covalent sigma bonds (Si&#8596;C and C&#8594;Si) between the Ph2C4 fragment in the anionic doublet state and silyl&#8208;amidine groups in the cationic doublet state. This may be due to the electron&#8208;deficient nature of olefin and electron&#8208;rich N&#8208;donating functional groups on silicon atoms. Compound 2 displays unprecedented chemical bonding in this class of compounds as predicted by EDA&#8208;NOCV calculations.

         <title>Enantiodivergent Synthesis of 3&#8208;Vinylphthalides via Rh&#8208;Catalyzed C&#9472;H Annulation: Experimental and Computational Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligand&#8208;controlled enantiodivergent synthesis of 3&#8208;vinylphthalides has been achieved through the chiral cyclopentadienylrhodium(III) catalyzed C&#9472;H bond functionalization of arylcarboxylic acids and [4+1]&#8208;annulation reaction with cyclopropenes.








ABSTRACT
Asymmetric transition metal catalysis represents the most reliable method for the chiral induction in organic scaffolds and to synthesize a wide array of valuable 3D&#8208;molecules. However, accessing both enantiomers of the chiral molecules from a catalyst(s) having the same chirality through ingenious stereo&#8208;control has remained a highly demanding task. Herein, we disclose the catalytic enantiodivergent synthesis of 3&#8208;vinylphthalides from arylcarboxylic acids and cyclopropenes, an efficient surrogate for vinylcarbenes. Through engineering the chiral cyclopentadienylrhodium(III) catalysts, both enantiomers have been achieved with excellent yield and enantioselectivity via regioselective C&#9472;H bond functionalization using a weakly coordinating directing group and asymmetric [4+1]&#8208;annulation. Experimental and computational investigations revealed the mechanism of the oxidative annulation and enantiodetermining ring&#8208;opening isomerization of cyclopropenes, which is governed by the stereoselective cleavage of the C&#9472;C bond. The present study opens a new avenue in asymmetric C&#9472;H bond functionalization and allows access to both enantiomers of the target molecules without altering the chirality of the ligand.

         <title>Identification of Natural Isonitriles Through Ligation to an Azomethine Imine Probe</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The azomethine imine (AMI)&#8211;isonitrile (NC) ligation allowed for the chemoselective detection of natural isonitriles in bacteria and fungi. The reactivity&#8208;based screening establishes a new stereogenic center, thereby allowing for facile distinction between chiral and achiral isonitriles. The work also unraveled a unique reactivity of isonitriles bearing an &#945;&#8208;COOH group.








ABSTRACT
Natural isonitriles are promising lead compounds for medicinal chemistry. Their identification is, however, challenging due to the hydrolytic lability of the isonitrile group. Here, we use the azomethine imine (AMI)&#8211;isonitrile ligation in a reactivity&#8208;based screening protocol for the chemoselective derivatization of natural isonitriles. The herein developed AMI probe rapidly reacts with isonitriles&#8212;primary, secondary, tertiary, as well as aromatic&#8212;to stable conjugates. A dibromide mass tag enables the detection of low&#8208;abundance isonitriles, even in complex biological matrices. The ligation establishes a new stereogenic center, thereby allowing facile distinction between achiral and chiral isonitriles by the formation of racemates or diastereoisomers, respectively. In addition, a unique reactivity of isonitriles bearing an &#945;&#8208;COOH group was unraveled. This AMI probe enabled the detection of known bacterially produced isonitriles and the identification of a novel fungal isonitrile.

The Mg&#9472;Mg&#8208;bonded compound [K(THF)3]2[LMg&#9472;MgL]2 (1, L = [(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3)NC(CH3)]22&#8722;) promotes reductive 4,4&#8242;&#8208;homocoupling of pyridines under ambient conditions and the coupled products can behave as H&#8208; (or D&#8208;) donors for hydrogenation of unsaturated bonds (C&#9552;C and C&#9552;N) in different types of substrates.








ABSTRACT
The Mg&#9472;Mg&#8208;bonded compound [K(THF)3]2[LMg&#9472;MgL]2 (1, L = [(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3)NC(CH3)]22&#8722;) can promote reductive 4,4&#8242;&#8208;homocoupling of pyridine and derivatives under ambient conditions, yielding the 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridinate products 2&#8211;6. Interestingly, these species can be viewed as &#8220;dimerized&#8221; metal&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydropyridinates (bis&#8208;M&#8208;DHPs) and can transfer hydrogen or deuterium (as proton and hydride) to pyridines, imines and alkenes. This may provide a facile access to new H/D&#8208;donors, readily obtained from commercially available pyridines and a conveniently synthesized magnesium(I) complex, for controllable H&#8208;transfer (HT) to different types of unsaturated molecules. The coupling and HT mechanisms were elucidated by DFT calculations.

         <title>[N&#8943;Br&#8943;N]+ Type Halogen Bonding: From Structure to Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work comprehensively summarizes the synthetic strategies to overcome the instability of Br+ species, with a focus on introducing the emerging and powerful [N&#8943;Br&#8943;N]+ motif and its application in halogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (XOFs). Current findings highlight the considerable potential of this motif to advance the development of controllable functional materials, thereby facilitating the design of stable Br+&#8208;bridged XOFs for use in catalysis, precision medicine, and related fields.








ABSTRACT
Noncovalent halogen bonding, particularly the three&#8208;center four&#8208;electron (3c&#8208;4e&#8722;) [N&#8943;X&#8943;N]+ motif, represents a critical tool in supramolecular chemistry and materials science. While I+&#8208;based systems are well&#8208;studied, this review focuses on the emerging and highly functional [N&#8943;Br&#8943;N]+ motif and its application in halogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (XOFs). The authors comprehensively summarize the synthetic strategies required to overcome the instability of the Br+ species, including halogen bond network spatial constraint, cation substitution, ligand exchange, and precise anionic regulation. Structural analysis reveals that the shorter N&#8943;Br bond length (2.07 &#197;) and stronger electron&#8208;deficient characteristics of the Br+&#8208;bridge provide unique functional advantages. This structural superiority translates to enhanced performance in applications such as selective alcohol oxidation and highly efficient photocatalytic H2O2 production, where XOFs(Br) materials consistently outperform their I&#8208;analogues and molecular precursors. Furthermore, it also highlights the potential of XOFs(Br) in biomedical fields, including superior antimicrobial activity and applications in photothermal therapy.

&lt;p&gt;This work comprehensively summarizes the synthetic strategies to overcome the instability of Br&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; species, with a focus on introducing the emerging and powerful [N&#8943;Br&#8943;N]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; motif and its application in halogen-bonded organic frameworks (XOFs). Current findings highlight the considerable potential of this motif to advance the development of controllable functional materials, thereby facilitating the design of stable Br&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-bridged XOFs for use in catalysis, precision medicine, and related fields.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noncovalent halogen bonding, particularly the three-center four-electron (3c-4e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) [N&#8943;X&#8943;N]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; motif, represents a critical tool in supramolecular chemistry and materials science. While I&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-based systems are well-studied, this review focuses on the emerging and highly functional [N&#8943;Br&#8943;N]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; motif and its application in halogen-bonded organic frameworks (XOFs). The authors comprehensively summarize the synthetic strategies required to overcome the instability of the Br&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; species, including halogen bond network spatial constraint, cation substitution, ligand exchange, and precise anionic regulation. Structural analysis reveals that the shorter N&#8943;Br bond length (2.07 &#197;) and stronger electron-deficient characteristics of the Br&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-bridge provide unique functional advantages. This structural superiority translates to enhanced performance in applications such as selective alcohol oxidation and highly efficient photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production, where XOFs(Br) materials consistently outperform their I-analogues and molecular precursors. Furthermore, it also highlights the potential of XOFs(Br) in biomedical fields, including superior antimicrobial activity and applications in photothermal therapy. This work confirms the significant potential of the [N&#8943;Br&#8943;N]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; motif to drive future innovation in controllable functional materials, paving the way for the design of stable Br&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-bridged XOFs for catalysis, precision medicine, and others.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulating Supramolecular Topology via Hydrogen Bonding in a Eumelanin Monomer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective methylation of a eumelanin monomer tunes hydrogen interactions, transforming helical assemblies into zigzag motifs and modulating excitonic interactions. This work reveals hydrogen interactions as a key handle for directing supramolecular topology and optical behavior.








ABSTRACT
Eumelanin is a bio&#8208;pigment with remarkable photoprotective properties, whose function is tied to its complex supramolecular organization. Although hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions are recognized as key forces in shaping its architecture, their individual contributions remain poorly defined. Among its molecular precursors, the canonical monomer 5,6&#8208;dihydroxyindole (DHI) is notable for forming extensive hydrogen&#8208;bonded networks that stabilize supramolecular assemblies. To clarify how hydrogen bonding influences supramolecular topology in eumelanin precursors, we investigate selectively methylated derivatives of DHI, examining how subtle modifications to hydrogen&#8208;bonding motifs alter crystal packing, intermolecular arrangements, and optical properties. Single&#8208;crystal structures reveal that O&#8208;methylation (DMI) changes hydrogen&#8208;bonding dimensionality yet preserves helical assemblies, whereas full O&#8208; and N&#8208;methylation (DMI&#8208;Me) suppresses hydrogen&#8208;bonding, giving rise to zigzag arrangements dominated by van der Waals forces. Solid&#8208; and solution&#8208;state NMR measurements independently confirm the differences in the hydrogen&#8208;bonded assemblies. Complementary electronic spectroscopy shows that noncovalent architectures of the eumelanin derivatives exhibit pronounced excitonic coupling between neighboring chromophores. Electronic structure calculations support these observations, demonstrating that coupling originates primarily from Coulombic interactions, with minimal contributions from charge transfer. By linking molecular substitution to packing motifs and excitonic interactions, this work establishes hydrogen bonding as a design element for directing supramolecular order and emergent optoelectronic behavior in eumelanin&#8208;inspired materials.

We report the synthesis bis(arylethynyl)naphtho&#8208; and anthraquinones via Rh(I)&#8208;catalyzed [2 + 2 + 2] cycloaddition reactions. The substrate scope of both quinones and linked bis&#8208;diynes was explored. Microwave irradiation remarkably enhanced yields. A fluorescent bis(methoxy)&#8208;bis(arylethynyl)naphthalene was synthesized, which underwent an unusual photooxidation in air under sunlight.








ABSTRACT
Herein, we report the Rh&#8208;catalyzed [2 + 2 + 2] cycloaddition of linked bis(diynes) Ar&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;(CH2)3&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;Ar with quinones for the rapid and efficient assembly of rigid structures containing bis(arylethynyl)naphthoquinones or anthraquinones using microwave radiation. The photophysical properties of the products were investigated, including absorption, emission, transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy, and singlet oxygen luminescence studies. However, the quinones did not exhibit photoluminescence or detectable singlet oxygen luminescence. Computational analysis via density functional theory (DFT) was performed to elucidate the electronic and structural factors influencing their behavior. Moreover, reductive methylation of one of the bis(arylethynyl)naphthoquinones (3aa) generated the fluorescent bis(methoxy) naphthalene derivative 4aa (&#934;f = 0.53). However, 4aa underwent photooxidation in air under sunlight via reaction with 1O2, which it sensitized, leading to ring opening of the bis(methoxy)arene ring.

         <title>Synergistic Alloy and Support Effects in Covalent Organic Framework&#8208;Stabilized AuPd Catalysts for Aerobic 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural Oxidation to 2,5&#8208;Furandicarboxylic Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
AuPd alloy nanoparticles were anchored on 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to integrate alloy&#8208;support synergistic effects. The catalyst Au67Pd33/TTATP achieved &gt;99% FDCA yield with the high metal utilization efficiency under mild conditions, owing to the synergy effect optimized reactant/product adsorption&#8208;desorption.








ABSTRACT
Catalytically converting 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) underpins renewable, bio &#8208;based plastics, yet designing metal&#8208;efficient catalysts remains challenging. Here, we combine alloy and support effects by anchoring AuPd alloy nanoparticles on 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Rationalizing alloy composition and COF functionality yielded Au67Pd33/TTATP, which converted HMF &#8594; FDCA in water using atmospheric O2 mild conditions, delivering &gt;99% FDCA yield, stable reusability, a turnover number (TON) of &#8764;100 at HMF/metal = 100, increasing to 518 at 600 (86.4% yield). High performance stems from alloy&#8208;support synergy that (i) partitions function (Au: HMF dehydrogenation; Pd: O2 activation) and (ii) matches adsorption&#8208;desorption (TTATP enriches HMF yet releases FDCA; alloy surfaces moderate HMF binding and avoid the strong FDCA adsorption of Pd alone), thereby enhancing metal atom efficiency.

         <title>Self&#8208;Calibrating Ratiometric DNA Aptamer Probe for Quantitative ATP Imaging in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed the RFA&#8211;ECHO probe, an internally calibrated ATP sensor that remains responsive across millimolar ATP levels. Its self&#8208;correcting Cy5/ECHO ratio ensures accurate quantification independent of probe uptake. Compared with FRET&#8208;based sensors, it yields a robust ratiometric shift, distinguishing high&#8208;ATP cancer cells from normal ones, enabling reliable metabolic imaging and diagnostics.








ABSTRACT
Accurate monitoring of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)&#8212;the universal energy currency of cells&#8212;is essential for elucidating cellular metabolism and disease progression. However, the high basal concentration of intracellular ATP (1&#8211;10&#160;mM) and variable probe uptake during imaging have hampered the development of reliable fluorescent sensors. Although DNA aptamer&#8208;based probes provide excellent selectivity, conventional turn&#8208;on designs often lack internal calibration, and F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer&#8208;based ratiometric probes typically exhibit limited signal changes. We report a ratiometric DNA duplex sensor comprising a Cy5&#8208;labeled ATP aptamer and a thiazole orange (TO)&#8208;labeled exciton&#8208;controlled hybridization&#8208;sensitive fluorescent oligonucleotide (ECHO) probe. Upon ATP binding, the aptamer structure switches and releases the reporter strand, resulting in a pronounced decrease in TO fluorescence while the Cy5 signal remains constant. Rational insertion of a polythymidine spacer effectively suppressed undesired TO&#8208;to&#8208;Cy5 energy transfer, enabling a reliable ratiometric Cy5/ECHO readout. The sensor operates robustly across physiological ATP concentrations, exhibits high nucleotide selectivity and satisfactory serum stability, and shows minimal cytotoxicity. Live&#8208;cell flow cytometry and confocal imaging further confirmed that cancer cells displayed significantly higher Cy5/ECHO ratios than normal fibroblasts. This internally self&#8208;calibrating aptamer sensor thus provides a powerful platform for intracellular ATP imaging and cancer diagnostics.

We report a ratiometric DNA duplex sensor comprising a Cy5-labeled ATP aptamer and a thiazole orange (TO)-labeled exciton-controlled hybridization-sensitive fluorescent oligonucleotide (ECHO) probe. Upon ATP binding, the aptamer structure switches and releases the reporter strand, resulting in a pronounced decrease in TO fluorescence while the Cy5 signal remains constant. Rational insertion of a polythymidine spacer effectively suppressed undesired TO-to-Cy5 energy transfer, enabling a reliable ratiometric Cy5/ECHO readout. The sensor operates robustly across physiological ATP concentrations, exhibits high nucleotide selectivity and satisfactory serum stability, and shows minimal cytotoxicity. Live-cell flow cytometry and confocal imaging further confirmed that cancer cells displayed significantly higher Cy5/ECHO ratios than normal fibroblasts. This internally self-calibrating aptamer sensor thus provides a powerful platform for intracellular ATP imaging and cancer diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Coordination Complexes and Polymers of Novel Hybrid Tetrazole&#8208;Triazole&#8208;Pyrazole Ligands: Synthesis, Structural Characterization, and Biological Evaluation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of new triazole, pyrazole, and tetrazole&#8208;based ligands and their coordination complexes with FeII, CoII, NiII, CuII, and CdII were synthesized and fully characterized, including crystal structures. M&#246;ssbauer and SQUID studies confirmed the high&#8208;spin state of the FeII complex. Most metal complexes showed higher cytotoxicity than their free ligands in human cancer cell lines. CoII complexes 2 and 8 displayed the strongest anticancer activity with IC50 values in the micromolar range.








ABSTRACT
New series of triazole/pyrazole and tetrazole/triazole/pyrazole ligands were synthesized and coordinated with various transition metals to yield a diverse library of 14 complexes. All compounds were fully characterized by elemental analysis, mass spectrometry, powder X&#8208;ray diffractometry, and a range of spectroscopic techniques (1H NMR, 13C NMR, FT&#8208;IR, and UV&#8211;visible diffuse reflectance). The crystal and molecular structures were elucidated via single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, and their supramolecular features were explored through Hirshfeld surface analysis. The 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer and magnetic SQUID measurements confirmed the high&#8208;spin nature of the FeII complex 1. In the three human cancer cell lines, most metal complexes are somewhat more cytotoxic than the inactive ligands, with Co(II) complexes 2 and 8 being the most potent in two of the cell lines (with IC50 values in the two&#8208;digit micromolar range). Overall, this study highlights how blending tetrazole/triazole/pyrazole ligands with transition metals can lead to coordination compounds with potential in anticancer research, as a proof of concept. These results add valuable insight to the expanding field of metal&#8208;based therapeutics and could help guide the development of next&#8208;generation, more effective agents.

         <title>Exploiting the Intrinsic Peroxidase Activity of Unspecific Peroxygenase for the Oxidative Cyclization of Ortho&#8208;Substituted Phenols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

ABSTRACT
Fungal unspecific peroxygenases (UPOs) have emerged as powerful catalysts for diverse oxidation reactions. While previous studies have predominantly focused on their native mono(per)oxygenase activity, their full catalytic potential remains underexplored. Herein, we demonstrate that the intrinsic peroxidative activity of UPOs can be effectively leveraged for the straightforward synthesis of benzoxazole compounds. Using the unspecific peroxygenase from Agrocybe aegerita, a broad range of ortho&#8208;patterned phenolic substrates were efficiently converted into high&#8208;value benzoxazoles with conversions of up to 99% under the neat reaction conditions. The enzyme exhibited superior catalytic performance compared to the well&#8208;established horseradish peroxidase. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that phenoxyl radicals generated by UPO's intrinsic peroxidase activity are essential for benzoxazole formation. This work not only presents a mild and efficient synthetic route to benzoxazoles but also expands the known reactivity and oxidative chemistry of UPOs.

         <title>Br&#248;nsted Acid Catalyzed Remote Bisvinylogous Initiated Formal [4+2] Cycloaddition Reaction of &#946;&#8208;Allyl Cycloalkenones With in situ Generated Ortho&#8208;Quinone Methides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Br&#248;nsted acid catalyzed, &#949;&#8208;regioselective, remote bisvinylogous initiated formal [4+2] cycloaddition of &#946;&#8208;allyl cycloalkenones with ortho&#8208;quinone methides (o&#8208;QMs) has been developed. In this transformation, &#946;&#8208;allyl cycloalkenones serve as dienophiles, while o&#8208;QMs act as diene precursors, enabling efficient access to naphthopyran derivatives with excellent selectivity under mild conditions.








ABSTRACT
In this work, we disclose that &#946;&#8208;allyl cycloalkenones can serve as effective bisvinylogous precursors through in situ generation of trienalcohol intermediates under Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis. This strategy enables a direct and highly diastereoselective &#948;,&#949;&#8208;regioselective remote bisvinylogous initiated formal [4+2] cycloaddition of &#946;&#8208;allyl cycloalkenones with ortho&#8208;quinone methides (o&#8208;QMs). In this process, &#946;&#8208;allyl cycloalkenones act as dienophiles while o&#8208;QMs function as diene precursors, providing efficient access to naphthopyran derivatives with excellent selectivity. Additionally, the asymmetric variant was also investigated using a BINOL&#8208;derived chiral Br&#248;nsted acid, thereby extending the utility of this method toward enantioselective synthesis.

5&#8208;Substituted 2&#8208;(naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;4H&#8208;chromen&#8208;4&#8208;ones are reported as a novel class of highly potent and selective triplex DNA ligands. These ligands induce triplex formation at submicromolar concentrations and inhibit enzymatic activity via ligand&#8208;mediated triplex formation. Binding to triplex DNA triggers an intense blue fluorescence emission in representative compound 3b, whereas no significant fluorescence emission occurs with duplex DNA.








ABSTRACT
We previously reported two series of 5&#8208;substituted flavonoids that selectively bind to triplex DNA while interacting minimally with duplex DNA. Our studies suggest that flavonoids are a promising scaffold for designing triplex ligands, owing to their mild synthesis conditions and ease of structural modification. In the present work, we introduce a novel class of highly potent triplex&#8208;specific ligands [5&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;(naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;4H&#8208;chromen&#8208;4&#8208;ones], developed by expanding the aromatic surface of the flavone moiety. UV thermal denaturation studies indicate these compounds strongly stabilize triplex DNAs, enabling their direct dissociation into random coils without transitioning through a duplex intermediate. Circular dichroism (CD) analysis reveals that these ligands induce much greater conformational changes in triplex DNA compared to duplex DNA. Fluorescent intercalator (FID) displacement assays cross&#8208;verify the importance of pendant chains for triplex binding. Viscosity measurements suggest that these compounds bind to triplex DNA via intercalation. Notably, a representative compound (3b) emits strong blue fluorescence upon binding to triplex DNA, allowing direct visualization under UV illumination and providing a convenient method for probing triplex DNA. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay confirms that 3b promotes triplex formation at submicromolar concentrations. Additionally, a plasmid&#8208;based assay developed in our lab demonstrates that 3b inhibits DraI endonuclease activity at low micromolar concentrations.

         <title>2&#8208;(Diphenylphosphinoyl)acetyl Group Enabled Divergent Synthesis of 2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;Acetyl Phenylethanoid Glycosides</title>

         <dc:description>
The DPPA&#8208;directed strategy applied for the synthesis of 2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl phenylethanoid glycosides (PGs) is described. The key DPPA group enables stereoselective glycosylation and selective late&#8208;stage deprotection, delivering PGs with retention of susceptible acetyl group.








ABSTRACT
Phenylethanoid glycosides (PGs), featuring a phenylethanoid glucoside core, exhibit diverse biological activities, notably neuroprotective effects. However, PGs bearing the susceptible 2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl group remain scarcely explored owing to their limited natural occurrence and the difficulty of preserving esters during synthesis. Herein, we describe the synthesis of such PGs, keeping the 2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl group intact via a remote DPPA&#8208;directed glycosylation strategy. The 2&#8208;(diphenylphosphinoyl)acetyl (DPPA) group ensures high stereocontrol through hydrogen&#8208;bonding in glycosylation, and can be selectively removed under mild Mg(OMe)2&#8208;promoted conditions. This approach enables streamlined access to both acetylated and non&#8208;acetylated PGs, including cistanosides&#160;E, G, and H, as well as the proposed structure of lophanthoside A. The developed method provides a general platform for constructing PGs bearing acyl groups and supports further investigation of their bioactive mechanisms.

         <title>Enhanced Activity and Stability of Horseradish Peroxidase via Immobilization on Hierarchical Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical Covalent Organic Frameworks (H&#8208;COF (PS)) are prepared using Polystyrene Spheres (PS) template. Created macrospores provide space for enzyme while the micropores concentrate substrates. The porous skeleton protects the loaded enzyme from inactivation at high temperature and in organic solvents. The horseradish peroxidase loaded is efficient in dye decolorization and 2,4&#8208;dichlorophenol degradation.








ABSTRACT
In this work, hierarchical covalent organic frameworks (H&#8208;COF (PS)) were prepared via a hard template strategy using polystyrene spheres (PS) as the template. The H&#8208;COF (PS) exhibits high stability in aqueous solution without skeleton collapse. When used as a carrier for enzyme immobilization, the H&#8208;COF (PS) shows several outstanding advantages. The well&#8208;defined macropores and micropores are distributed throughout the COF. The created macrospores provide sufficient space for distribution of enzyme while the intrinsic micropores can concentrate substrates. The macropores and micropores in H&#8208;COF (PS) are adjacent, so the substrate can access to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) with lower diffusion resistance than that in solution, resulting in enhanced enzymatic catalytic activity. The porous skeleton in H&#8208;COF (PS) can protect the embedded enzyme from inactivation caused by high temperature and organic solvents, ensuring HRP stability under strict reaction conditions. The prepared HRP immobilized H&#8208;COF (PS) (HRP@H&#8208;COF(PS)) demonstrates high efficiency in dye decolorization applications. This work provides a new platform to design enzyme&#8208;nanomaterials composites with both high activity and stability.

         <title>Amplified Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Chiral AIE&#8208;active Tetraphenylbutadiene Derivatives in Nematic Liquid Crystal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microscale doping of chiral AIE&#8208;active tetraphenylbutadiene derivatives (TPB&#8208;Chol*&#8208;H, TPB&#8208;Chol*&#8208;CHO, and TPB&#8208;Chol*&#8208;OC6) into the achiral nematic LC 5CB induces the formation of helical supramolecular architectures through host&#8208;guest interactions, yielding CPL&#8208;active composites that exhibit both a high dissymmetry factor (glum = +0.58) and an excellent photoluminescence quantum yield (&#934;PL = 84.5%).








ABSTRACT
Circularly polarized luminescent (CPL) materials featuring high luminescence dissymmetry factors (glum), high photoluminescence quantum yields (&#934;PL), and tunable emission properties are essential for practical applications. Herein, three chiral aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) tetraphenylbutadiene (TPB) derivatives (TPB&#8208;Chol*&#8208;H, TPB&#8208;Chol*&#8208;CHO, TPB&#8208;Chol*&#8208;OC6) with high &#934;PL were synthesized, each bearing symmetric chiral bis&#8208;cholesteryl moieties and different electron&#8208;donating/accepting groups. When employed as chiral dopants, minute quantities of each derivative were individually doped into the achiral nematic liquid crystal (LC) 5CB, affording three series of luminescent chiral nematic LC composite systems (TPB&#8208;N*&#8208;LCs). These composites exhibit remarkable CPL activity with high glum values, attributed to host&#8208;guest interactions that facilitate co&#8208;assembly into ordered supramolecular helices and chiral amplification, despite the chiral AIE dopant itself lacking CPL emission. CPL signals and glum values enhance with increasing chiral dopant loading, peaking at +0.31, +0.42, and +0.58 for TPB&#8208;Chol*&#8208;H/5CB, TPB&#8208;Chol*&#8208;CHO/5CB, and TPB&#8208;Chol*&#8208;OC6/5CB, respectively, at 3 wt% doping. Notably, the introduction of electron&#8208;donating hexyloxy groups (TPB&#8208;Chol*&#8208;OC6) or electron&#8208;accepting aldehyde groups (TPB&#8208;Chol*&#8208;CHO) modulates molecular packing, compatibility with 5CB host, and intermolecular interactions. Doping TPB&#8208;Chol*&#8208;OC6 into 5CB achieves the optimal performance, with glum = +0.58 and &#934;PL = 84.5%. This work offers an effective strategy for developing CPL materials with simultaneously high glum and &#934;PL.

The functionalization of a dicopper(II, II) complex with a pyrene anchoring group allows to build functional electrodes for the toluene partial oxidation in different solvents.








ABSTRACT
A novel dicopper(II, II) complex (Cpyrene) was attached on multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) electrodes resulting in a nanohybrid electrode (MWCNT@Cpyrene) able to partially oxidize toluene to benzaldehyde and benzyl alcohol with 300 and 409 TON h&#8722;1, respectively, in 1,2&#8208;difluorobenzene. Exchanging the solvent by acetonitrile leads to the additional N&#8208;benzylacetamide formation from the C&#8211;N coupling of toluene and in situ solvent oxidation with 313 TON h&#8722;1 at room temperature.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Methods for the Synthesis of All Three Bonds of the Alkyne's Triple Bond</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;pot transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free methods for the synthesis of all three bonds of the alkyne's triple bond are reviewed. After analysis of several named reactions and discussion of improvements, recent advances in the synthesis of alkynes are discussed. Each section contains a proposed reaction mechanism and analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the approaches.








Abstract
Alkynes are among the most useful functional groups in synthetic chemistry, as they are excellent starting materials for various reactions and serve as valuable precursors during total synthesis. Despite the high number of transformations that utilize alkynes as substrates, few methods actually exist to synthesize them. Known methods involve several synthetic steps, harsh conditions, or cryogenic temperatures, which render them inconvenient and inefficient. This review of alkyne syntheses cover methods that enable the formation of all three bonds of the alkyne's triple bond in a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free, one&#8208;pot fashion. This review offers a guide to gauge if current methods are potentially suitable to be scaled and used in industry and pharmaceutical processes.

Known methods involve several synthetic steps, harsh conditions, or cryogenic temperatures, which render them inconvenient and inefficient. This review of alkyne syntheses cover methods that enable the formation of all three bonds of the alkyne's triple bond in a transition-metal-free, one-pot fashion. This review offers a guide to gauge if current methods are potentially suitable to be scaled and used in industry and pharmaceutical processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
