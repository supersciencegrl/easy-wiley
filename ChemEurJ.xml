         <title>Asymmetric Cascade Michael&#8208;Cyclopropanation&#8208;Rearrangement to Spiro[Furo[2,3&#8208;d]Pyrimidines]</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, chiral spiro[furo[2,3&#8208;d]pyrimidines] are synthesized by integrating two biologically active heterocyclic scaffolds, furo[2,3&#8208;d]pyrimidines and oxindoles, in a single molecule in the presence of quinine&#8208;derived squaramide through Cascade Michael&#8208;Cyclopropanation&#8208;Rearrangement. Structurally diverse spiro[furo[2,3&#8208;d]pyrimidines] with excellent yield and selectivity demonstrating the efficacy and versatility of the protocol. 1H NMR and HRMS titrations support the proposed mechanism.








Abstract
An unprecedented organocatalytic enantioselective methodology has been unlocked to access oxindole&#8208;fused spiro[furo[2,3&#8208;d]pyrimidines] with high bond efficiency (two new C&#8208;C bonds and one C&#8208;O bond) and two contiguous stereocenters via Cascade Michael&#8208;Cyclopropanation&#8208;Rearrangement. A series of spiro[furo[2,3&#8208;d]pyrimidines] has been synthesized in excellent yield (up to 90%) and stereoselectivity (dr up to 99:1, er up to 97:3) from 3&#8208;chlorooxindoles and 5&#8208;alkylidene barbituric acids at room temperature. 1H NMR and HRMS studies have been conducted to define the reaction pathway.

         <title>Total Synthesis and Analysis of Phenolic Phytoprostanes, Oxidized Derivatives of Lipophenols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total synthesis of four hydroxytyrosol&#8208;phytoprostanes (PhytoPs&#8208;HT) was achieved in 20 steps, enabling their first identification as HT&#8208;&#945;&#8208;linolenate oxidation products. This work revealed new oxidized derivatives of lipophenols via UHPLC&#8208;MS/MS analysis, offering a strategy to trace HT&#8208;derived compounds in complex matrices, aiding food and biomedical research.








Abstract
Lipophenols, or phenolipids, are compounds that combine polyphenols with fatty acids, offering the antioxidant properties of polyphenols alongside the neuroprotective and cardioprotective benefits of omega&#8208;3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Hydroxytyrosol (HT)&#8208;based lipophenols have recently been identified in olive oil. Depending on their structure, these compounds were differently affected by storage conditions. While the concentrations of HT&#8208;oleate and HT&#8208;linoleate increase with higher storage temperatures, HT&#8208;&#945;&#8208;linolenate (HT&#8208;ALA) did not follow the same trend. Given the high oxidative susceptibility of &#945;&#8208;linolenic acid (ALA), which leads to oxidation products known as phytoprostanes (PhytoPs), we hypothesize that HT&#8208;ALA may be oxidized into covalently bound PhytoP conjugates of HT (PhytoPs&#8208;HT) under various oxidative conditions, including, for example, suboptimal storage. This study aims to develop the first total synthesis of two series of PhytoPs&#8208;HT as analytical standards to explore the oxidative transformation of HT&#8208;ALA lipophenols into potential oxylipin metabolites. The synthesis of four ALA&#8208;derived PhytoPs&#8208;HT and their identification during in vitro oxidation of HT&#8208;ALA by UHPLC&#8208;HRMS/MS are presented here. These synthetic standards are essential for the reliable identification and quantification of HT&#8208;PhytoPs within complex mixtures of regio&#8208; and stereoisomers generated during oxylipin formation.

         <title>Methyl on the Bridge: 2&#8208;Methyl Propellane as Precursor for 1,3&#8208;Substituted 2&#8208;Methylated Bicyclo[1.1.1]Pentanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of 2&#8208;methyl propellane and its conversion to various 1,2&#8208; and 1,2,3&#8208;di&#8208; and trisubstituted bicyclopentanes is reported.








Abstract
Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCPs) have emerged as isosteric replacements for mono&#8208; and para&#8208;substituted benzene rings in medicinal and materials applications, involving substitution at the BCP bridgehead (1,3&#8208;positions). BCP functionalization at the 2&#8208;position is much less straightforward and currently under intense investigation. Herein, we report a synthetic route to 2&#8208;methyl BCPs allowing for functionalization at the 1,3&#8208;positions, with the novel 2&#8208;methyl[1.1.1]propellane as a key intermediate. Next to an optimization for the synthesis of 2&#8208;Me&#8208;propellane, this work contains an investigation of its reactivity leading to 1,2&#8208;disubstituted and 1,2,3&#8208;trisubstituted BCP derivatives. Compared to nonsubstituted propellane, the synthesis of 2&#8208;methyl propellane was lower&#8208;yielding, and its ring&#8208;opening reactions proceeded in similar or lower yields, with radical&#8208;based reactions generally giving the best results. A preliminary study of selected physicochemical properties was conducted to assess the impact of the introduction of a bridge&#8208;methyl group, showing an expected increase of about 0.5 logP units and featuring lower melting points.

         <title>Narrowband Tetradentate Pt(II) Complexes&#8208;Based Deep&#8208;Blue OLEDs with Low Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient deep&#8208;blue OLEDs using two tetradentate Pt(II) complexes as emitters are fabricated, which exhibit narrow emission spectra with full&#8208;width at half maximum (FWHM) of 25 and 26&#160;nm, respectively, resulting in small CIEy values &lt; 0.15. The OELDs also show low efficiency roll&#8208;off of 8.3% and 8.0% at 1000&#160;cd/m2, respectively.








Abstract
This study designed and synthesized two tetradentate Pt(II) complexes featured with aryl&#8208; modified N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands, PtTJ&#8208;Ph and PtTJ&#8208;bPh, which exhibited narrow emission spectra with full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 19.0 and 19.8&#160;nm in dichloromethane, respectively. They also showed remarkably high photoluminescence quantum yields of 99% and 93%, along with short excited&#8208;state lifetimes of 2.72 &#181;s and 2.34 &#181;s in poly(methyl methacrylate (PMMA) films, respectively. Deep&#8208;blue OLED device using PtTJ&#8208;Ph as emitter exhibited narrowband emission spectrum peaking at 458&#160;nm with a small FWHM value of 25&#160;nm, resulting in a small Commission Internationale de l'&#201;clairage (CIE) y coordinate of 0.138. The device also achieved a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 22.7%, and maintained an EQE of 20.8% at 1000&#160;cd/m2 with a low efficiency roll&#8208;off of only 8.3%, demonstrating excellent electroluminescent properties for deep&#8208;blue OLED application.

         <title>Inherently Chiral Calix[4]Arene Derivatives: Concept and Enantioselective Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 57, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The past decade has seen a significant rise in the enantioselective synthesis of calix[4]arene derivatives with inherent chirality, which arises from the twisted macrocyclic structures of the linked aryl groups. This development is crucial for applications in chiral catalyst design and the creation of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials. Two main strategies have been extensively explored: the de novo synthesis of macrocycles and the desymmetrization of prochiral calix[4]arene derivatives. This review highlights the enantioselective synthetic approaches used to achieve inherently chiral calix[4]arene derivatives and offers a forward&#8208;looking perspective on future advancements in this field.








Abstract
Calix[4]arene derivatives possess chirality derived from macrocycles with twisted linked aryls and have numerous applications in chiral recognition, chiral sensors, circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials, and enantioselective catalysis. Due to their unique structural scaffolds, calix[4]arene derivatives have seen increased attention in enantioselective synthesis in recent decades. Although many achievements have been made in this area based on desymmetrization or de novo macrocycle synthesis strategies, new calix[4]arene derivatives structures and efficient enantioselective synthesis methodologies are highly desirable. This review highlights recent enantioselective synthesis strategies and provides perspectives for future developments.

         <dc:description>
Aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) have emerged as a leading electrochemical technology for grid&#8208;scale energy storage, using water&#8208;based electrolytes to deliver inherent safety and cost efficiency. High&#8208;performance ion exchange membranes&#160;promote the battery performance, including energy/power densities, operational durability, and Coulombic/energy efficiencies. This review examines recent advances in ion channel engineering for AORFB membranes, focusing on chemical synthesis strategies, structural optimization approaches, and ion channel architecture evolution. We analyze characterization methodologies for diverse membrane types, their corresponding cell performance, and design principles.&#160;We highlight conductivity&#8208;permeability relationships across membrane architectures, particularly microphase separation, microporous channels, and dual&#8208;ion configurations, establishing fundamental structure&#8208;property correlations.&#160;These insights provide a strategic roadmap for future ion channel design in membranes, advancing practical frameworks for high&#8208;performance AORFBs.








Abstract
Aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) have emerged as one of the most promising electrochemical technologies for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their use of water&#8208;based electrolytes, offering safety and cost advantages over organic solvent&#8208;based systems. AORFBs utilize organic molecules derived from earth&#8208;abundant elements, enabling tunable properties such as solubility, stability, and redox potential at the molecular level. These features enable improvements in energy and power densities, operational lifetimes, and efficiency metrics in the battery system. However, the lack of suitable ion exchange membranes limits the energy efficiency, power density, and long&#8208;term cycling stability. Membrane design for AORFBs faces challenges in balancing conductivity and permeability, requiring precise control over ion transfer channel size, quantity, and interconnection. This review summarizes recent advances in AORFBs membrane design, focusing on ion channel engineering through chemical and microstructural adjustments. We highlight the impact of these designs on membrane conductivity, permeability, and overall cell performance, aiming to provide a practical framework for developing superior membranes for future grid&#8208;scale AORFBs applications.

In the context of developing therapies for dementias and cognitive decline, potent dual acting molecules targeting the GPCR 5HT6 and the enzyme HDAC6 with favorable BBB penetration profile were designed and synthesised.








Abstract
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) impacts significantly the quality of life of people aged over 65 years old, while millions more suffer from other types of dementia, yet no effective drugs exist. The few approved drugs in this area address mostly the associated symptoms, while several selective agents acting on promising targets have failed in clinical trials. The complexity of neurodegenerative diseases has prompted multitargeting ligands as the new paradigm, where more than one biological mechanism may be perturbed synergistically.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's Disease (AD) impacts significantly the quality of life of people aged over 65 years old, while millions more suffer from other types of dementia, yet no effective drugs exist. The few approved drugs in this area address mostly the associated symptoms, while several selective agents acting on promising targets have failed in clinical trials. The complexity of neurodegenerative diseases has prompted multitargeting ligands as the new paradigm, where more than one biological mechanism may be perturbed synergistically. In this context, we explored the design and synthesis of dual 5-&#919;&#932;&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;antagonists / HDAC6 inhibitors since these actions have been individually demonstrated to elicit cognitive-enhancing effects. Prototypes with this dual action on a GPCR and an enzyme were designed and synthesized by tethering an aryl-hydroxamic acid unit, an established pharmacophore for HDAC6 inhibition, to the piperazine of intepirdine, a potent 5-&#919;&#932;&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;antagonist.&#160;A new gram-scale synthesis of intepirdine was&#160;developed&#160;followed&#160;by&#160;attaching&#160;different types of arylhydroxamic acids.&#160;Derivative RG-283AG emerged to possess sub-micromolar potency toward HDAC6 inhibition (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;0.54 &#956;&#956;), nanomolar affinity (K&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;0.7&#160;nM) for 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;receptor and favorable BBB penetration capacity, thus constituting the first example of a dual-acting 5-&#919;&#932;&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;/ HDAC6 ligand with potential cognitive-enhancing properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Beyond Neuroprostanes: Total Synthesis and Epilipidomic Studies of a Novel Cyclopentenone Metabolite of Docosahexaenoic Acid</title>

Neuroprostanes are bioactive oxylipins from docosahexaenoic acid oxidation, serving as oxidative stress biomarkers. In this work, the enantioselective synthesis of 4&#8208;A4&#8208;NeuroP&#8208;1,4&#8208;lactone and 4&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#916;4,6&#8208;A4&#8208;NeuroP has been accomplished using Michael addition, olefin metatheses, and Wittig olefinations as key steps. Notably, 4&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#916;4,6&#8208;A4&#8208;NeuroP was detected for the first time in trout brains, underscoring its biological significance.








Abstract
Neuroprostanes (NeuroPs) are bioactive oxylipins formed in vivo from docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), the main polyunsaturated fatty acid of the human brain, by a nonenzymatic auto&#8208;oxidative process as mixtures of regio&#8208; and diastereoisomers. Thus, synthetic material is necessary to unlock their potential as oxidative stress biomarkers as well as to investigate the biological properties of individual NeuroP molecules. Despite recent advances in the field, cyclopentenone&#8208;type NeuroPs have received limited attention. Here, we present an enantioselective total synthesis of 4&#8208;A4&#8208;NeuroP&#8208;1,4&#8208;lactone and its dehydrated metabolite, 4&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#916;4,6&#8208;A4&#8208;NeuroP. The asymmetric synthesis of the chiral core relies on a robust organocatalyzed Michael addition. The assembly of the full carbon framework was accomplished via selective double olefin metathesis and Wittig olefination. The MS2 spectra of the 4&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#916;4,6&#8208;A4&#8208;NeuroP was carefully studied using molecular network and quantum chemistry software to elucidate its unique fragmentation pattern. Also, preliminary analytical studies showed for the first&#8208;time tangible amounts of 4&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#916;4,6&#8208;A4&#8208;NeuroP in trout brains.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of the Mirror&#8208;Image Fast&#8208;PETase by the Enzyme&#8208;Cleavable Solubilizing&#8208;Tag Strategy</title>

Abstract
Mirror&#8208;image poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) plastic&#8208;degrading enzymes have emerged as promising biocatalytic platforms due to their exceptional enzymatic stability and low immunogenicity. Currently, the sole reported mirror&#8208;image plastic&#8208;degrading enzyme, the D&#8208;form of 231&#8208;residue PET hydrolase ICCG (engineered leaf&#8208;branch compost cutinase variant), suffers from thermophilic activity requirements, which limits its practical applications. Here, the first total chemical synthesis of a mirror&#8208;image 271&#8208;residue D&#8208;Fast&#8208;PETase was presented by using an enzyme&#8208;cleavable solubilizing tag strategy. Comparative kinetic analysis revealed that D&#8208;Fast&#8208;PETase showed a remarkable increase (&#8764;20&#8208;fold within 24&#160;hours) in PET degradation efficiency compared to D&#8208;ICCG at temperatures of 37 &#176;C, making it a promising candidate for prolonged PET decomposition in open environments and holding potential in addressing microplastic&#8208;related health issues within the biomedical field. This work not only expands the chemical biology toolbox for mirror&#8208;image enzyme synthesis but also establishes D&#8208;Fast&#8208;PETase as a candidate in combating the dual crises of global plastic pollution and microplastic&#8208;associated health risks.

&lt;p&gt;Mirror-image poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) plastic-degrading enzymes have emerged as promising biocatalytic platforms due to their exceptional enzymatic stability and low immunogenicity. Currently, the sole reported mirror-image plastic-degrading enzyme, the D-form of 231-residue PET hydrolase ICCG (engineered leaf-branch compost cutinase variant), suffers from thermophilic activity requirements, which limits its practical applications. Here, the first total chemical synthesis of a mirror-image 271-residue D-Fast-PETase was presented by using an enzyme-cleavable solubilizing tag strategy. Comparative kinetic analysis revealed that D-Fast-PETase showed a remarkable increase (&#8764;20-fold within 24&#160;hours) in PET degradation efficiency compared to D-ICCG at temperatures of 37 &#176;C, making it a promising candidate for prolonged PET decomposition in open environments and holding potential in addressing microplastic-related health issues within the biomedical field.

         <title>Pyrrole&#8208;Imine Macrocycle: Self&#8208;Organizing Cross&#8208;Reactive Anion Receptor and Sensor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 57, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An imine macrocycle comprising pyrroles as hydrogen&#8208;bond donors and an environmentally sensitive fluorophore displays a wide cross&#8208;reactive binding, which, in combination with an analyte&#8208;specific fluorescence response allows differentiation between ten analytes and their concentrations. Thus, one cross&#8208;reactive sensor performs the work of multiple, essentially acting as a &#8220;sensor array of one molecule&#8221;.








Abstract
Self&#8208;organizing macrocyclic receptor&#8208;sensors for phosphorus oxyanions, phosphates, and phosphonates comprising imine moieties were prepared by condensation of dipyrrolylmethane dicarbaldehyde with diethylene triamine. The incorporation of flexible ethylene moieties endows the macrocycle with unprecedented flexibility and ability to accommodate numerous phosphorus oxyanions from orthophosphate to large anions such as ATP or phosphonate glyphosate. The anion binding was elucidated by NMR titrations, low&#8208;temperature NMR, and NOESY NMR. The incorporation of dansyl fluorophore enables sensing of anions using the fluorescence signal, whereas the changes in fluorescence intensity, width of the fluorescence band, and position of the maxima are analyte&#8208;specific and useful in recognition and identification of eleven different P&#8208;oxyanions in water. The affinity (Kassoc) for Na+ salts was H2PO4&#8722; &#8776; Methylphosphonate&#160;&gt;&#160;H2P2O72&#8722; &gt; Phenylphosphonate&#8208;&#160;&gt;&#160;Glyphosate2&#8208;&#160;&gt;&#160;AMP2&#8208; &gt; ADP2&#8722; &gt; ATP2&#8722;. Interestingly, phosphonates, including methylphosphonate and glyphosate anions, were also found to display a strong affinity (Kassoc&#160;&#8764;106 M&#8722;1) while halides, nitrate, carbonates, or hydrogen sulfate did not show a significant affinity. The determined fluorescence spectral parameters were used to classify the 12 analytes (11 anions and water) using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). Quantification was performed using LDA and Support Vector Machine (SVM), and the phosphonate concentrations in unknown samples were determined with an error of 3.5% or lower.

         <dc:description>
An efficient and convenient catalyst based on MnAl layered double oxide (Mn2Al&#8208;LDO) has been developed for the aerobic oxidative transformations of 1,2&#8208;diols and alcohols under normal pressure without any additives. The excellent electron transfer ability and strong surface basic sites of the catalyst realize the oxidation primarily via two&#8208;electron transfer (TET), and minorly via single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) processes.








Abstract
An efficient and convenient MnAl layered double oxide (Mn2Al&#8208;LDO) catalyst has been developed. Characterization results indicated that Mn2Al&#8208;LDO exhibits an improved ability of electron transfer and increased surface strong basic sites on its surface compared to the layered double hydroxide (Mn2Al&#8208;LDH) precursor and conventionally prepared Mn2AlOx. These characters endow the Mn2Al&#8208;LDO with excellent catalytic performance in the aerobic oxidative cleavage of 1,2&#8208;diols under normal pressure without additives. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that both the two&#8208;electron transfer (TET) and single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) processes are included in the catalytic reaction, with the former being more prominent. The Mn2Al&#8208;LDO catalytic system can tolerate a broad substrate scope, including monosubstituted 1,2&#8208;diols, internal 1,2&#8208;diols, primary alcohols, secondary alcohols, and various &#945;&#8208;functionalized alcohols. Additionally, the Mn2Al&#8208;LDO catalytic system also exhibits excellent catalytic stability and shows great potential for application in cascade transformations.

         <title>Alternating Orthogonal Switching in a Thiophenyl&#8208;Phenyl&#8208;Bis&#8208;Azobenzene Switch</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 57, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study employs computational calculations and ultrafast spectroscopy to design and probe alternate isomerization in a bis&#8208;azobenzene molecule. The phenyl&#8208; and thiophenylazobenzene moieties exhibit independent switching under different wavelengths, advancing multi&#8208;photoswitch applications.








Abstract
To design efficient molecular information storage systems with multi&#8208;photoswitchable entities, orthogonal isomerization of the different switchable moieties is essential. Various challenges, like unintentional energy transfer, spectral overlap, and other energy dissipation channels, have to be addressed by intelligent molecule design. In this context, we took advantage of calculations to design a bis&#8208;azobenzene switch, which consists of a phenyl&#8208; and a thiophenylazobenzene moiety in meta&#8208;connection to reduce &#960;&#8208;conjugation. Ultrafast spectroscopy and computational studies confirmed that this bis&#8208;photoswitch exhibits alternating orthogonal switching behavior when irradiated with light of different wavelengths. These results represent a significant advancement toward the development of efficient and adaptable organic multi&#8208;photoswitches for applications, such as information storage, molecular machines, or smart materials.

         <title>Zincophilic MOF Protective Layer for Stable Zinc Anodes in Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are under the spotlight due to their substantial potential, abundant natural resources, inherent safety, and high specific capacity. However, uncontrollable zinc dendrite growth and side reactions on the zinc surface hinder the application of ZIBs. In this article, a uniform copper&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) coating layer was fabricated on a zinc metal surface (CuZIF@Zn) to serve as a protective interface. Synchrotron X&#8208;ray techniques were employed to study the electrode structure before and after cycling. With its special structure, the MOF interfacial layer acts as an effective barrier layer to isolate the zinc anode from water molecules and electrolyte, thereby suppressing interfacial side reactions and passivation. Additionally, the abundance of zincophilic sites in the CuZIF layer ensures uniform deposition of Zn2+ while effectively inhibiting the growth of dendritic structures. Consequently, the CuZIF@Zn//CuZIF@Zn symmetric batteries exhibited cycling stability over 1000 cycles at 1.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, attributed to the protective layer. Furthermore, a full cell incorporating an MnO2 cathode maintained 189 mAh g&#8722;1 over 700 cycles, demonstrating remarkable long&#8208;term cycling performance.

         <title>Transformation of Silyl&#8208;Protected Tetrafluorinated Thia[6]helicene S&#8208;Oxide into a Difluorinated Coronene via Induced Desilylation</title>

         <dc:description>
Trimethylsilyl&#8208;protected tetrafluorinated thia[6]helicene S&#8208;oxide undergoes a more efficient transformation to difluorinated coronene than its unprotected S&#8208;oxide and S,S&#8208;dioxide counterparts. Si&#183;&#183;&#183;F interactions and in&#8208;situ&#8208;generated sulfur monoxide facilitate selective desilylation, offering mechanistic insight into this cascade transformation.








Abstract
Sulfur oxidation of thiophene rings is an effective strategy for constructing substituted and polycyclic arenes via Diels&#8211;Alder reactions, wherein each thiophene ring is converted into a benzene ring. In the context of converting helicenes into planar coronenes, tetrafluorinated thia[6]helicene S,S&#8208;dioxide undergoes a smooth intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reaction to afford the difluorinated coronene. However, the corresponding S&#8208;oxide counterpart is affected by competing side reactions that limit its utility. Herein, we demonstrate that introducing a trimethylsilyl (TMS) group onto the thiophene S&#8208;oxide ring suppresses self&#8208;condensation and enables more efficient coronene conversion than its S,S&#8208;dioxide counterpart. Unexpectedly, the TMS group is removed during the transformation, yielding both the TMS&#8208;protected and deprotected forms of the difluorinated coronene. Mechanistic investigations suggest that this desilylation arises from the combined effect of Si&#183;&#183;&#183;F interactions and in&#8208;situ&#8208;generated sulfur monoxide (SO). These findings provide insights into the reactivity control of thiophene S&#8208;oxides and demonstrate how silicon, fluorine, and SO can influence cascade transformations toward functionalized polycyclic aromatic systems.

         <title>Electron Density&#8208;Dependent Mallory Photocyclization Constructs Rigid Saddle&#8208;Shaped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons with Enhanced Aromaticity</title>

Saddle&#8208;Shaped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons have been synthesized via highly efficient Mallory reaction, and exhibited extended aromatic skeleton with high quantum yields in solutions and aggregation casued quenching in solid states.








Abstract
This study reports the synthesis of three saddle&#8208;shaped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)&#8212;bFT&#8208;C, bFP&#8208;C, and bFP2&#8208;C&#8212;via Mallory photocyclization of bisfluorenylidene&#8208;dihydroacene precursors. The reaction achieved high yields (77&#8211;88%) under UV irradiation, with structural characterization confirming enhanced aromaticity and rigid frameworks in the cyclized products. Kinetic studies revealed that anthracene&#8208;containing bFP2 exhibited the fastest reaction rate, which we attribute to its elevated electron density. Photophysical studies showed strong solution fluorescence (PLQY: 45&#8211;48%) but aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) in solids due to enhanced &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. Electrochemical analyses revealed reversible redox processes, while low&#8208;temperature spectroscopy identified deep&#8208;red phosphorescence (lifetimes: 72.6&#8211;270.0&#160;ms). This work demonstrates how precursor architecture governs reaction kinetics and photophysical properties, providing a design strategy for nonplanar PAHs with tailored luminescence characteristics.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Carbon Dots as Photon&#8208;Triggered Pyroptosis Inducers for Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept article highlights the recent developments in the field of PTP using nonmetallic nanomaterials that have photocatalytic properties and can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition, it aims to offer a systematic overview of the progression and utilization of nonmetallic carbon dots in PTP, thereby contributing to the renewed comprehension of their applications and potential in cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
Pyroptosis, a highly immunogenic form of programmed cell death, is characterized by the release of proinflammatory cytokines. Recently, researchers have focused on the use of light to control pyroptosis induction, an approach that holds great promise as being relatively noninvasive and allows for precise spatiotemporal control. Photon&#8208;triggered pyroptosis (PTP) has made great progress in cancer immunotherapy. This concept article highlights the recent developments of metal&#8208;free nanomaterials (especially carbon dots) mediated&#8208;PTP, including the synthetic routes, their photophysical properties and applications in the area of cancer immunotherapy.

The phosphorus compounds bearing a NCN&#8208;type pincer ligand, the 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,6&#8208;bis(benzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzene ligand (BZIMB), were synthesized and characterized using spectroscopic methods. Compared with the P&#9472;N bond in topologically related compounds bearing an NNN&#8208;type pincer ligand, the robust P&#9472;C bond allows reactions with various reagents, leading to phosphorus compounds in different oxidation states without dissociation of the phosphorus atom.








Abstract
A series of phosphorus compounds bearing the 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,6&#8208;bis(benzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzene ligand (BZIMB) were prepared and fully characterized using spectroscopic methods, including X&#8208;ray crystallography. Reaction of the PIII compounds with electrophilic reagents led to PV compounds. Reaction with reducing reagents led to PI phosphinidenes. The phosphinidenes react with electrophilic reagents to generate new PIII compounds. In contrast to topologically related compounds featuring labile P&#9472;N bonds, the robust P&#9472;C bond between the phosphorus center and the ligand prevents dissociation of the phosphorus atom during oxidation and reduction, showing the potential for small molecule activation and opening the door for future catalytic studies.

         <title>A General Synthesis Approach to Double&#8208;Guanidinium Stapled Peptides and Foldamers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our previous guanidinium stapling strategy has been extended to the generation of bis&#8208;guanidinium stapled peptides and foldamers. This rapid and efficient approach, developed on solid&#8208;support, allows for easy modulation of the ring size and the nature of the linker to reach high affinity hDM2 binders.








Abstract
In the broader context of peptide macrocyclization, methods enabling the formation of specific crosslinks between orthogonally protected, amino&#8208;functionalized side chains (e.g., Lys&#8211;Lys crosslinks) are of potential interest for expanding molecular diversity and stabilizing peptide secondary structures. We recently introduced a solid&#8208;phase synthesis approach for the rapid generation of guanidinium stapled helical peptides and have shown their utility for inhibition of protein&#8211;protein interactions. Whereas our previous work concentrated on the formation of mono&#8208;guanidinium crosslinks, we show here that we can expand this approach to prepare bis&#8208;guanidinium stapled peptides and foldamers on&#8208;resin. The methodology similarly uses two orthogonally protected amino&#8208;functionalized side chains and features the use of a diamino connector. The two guanidinium groups are introduced sequentially, the first one intermolecularly and the second intramolecularly. The method is compatible with the i,i&#160;+&#160;4 and i,i&#160;+&#160;7 cyclization schemes and tolerates a diversity of diamino linkers. We applied the strategy to the synthesis of macrocyclic inhibitors of hDM2 and hDMX and identified several high affinity binders for the two proteins.

         <title>T&#189; Tuning in a Synergistic BODIPY&#8208;Tetrazole Fe(II) Spin&#8208;Crossover&#8208;Photoluminescence System via Co&#8208;Ligand Variation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a modular spin crossover&#8208;photoluminescence (SCO&#8208;PL) system: heteroleptic, mononuclear Fe(II) coordination compounds bearing equatorial BODIPY fluorophores that exhibit synergistic PL response upon spin state switching. Exchanging apical nitrile co&#8208;ligands tunes electronic and structural properties, giving precise control over the SCO and PL response. This versatile SCO&#8208;PL platform offers bifunctional behavior for photonic applications.








Abstract
Bifunctional materials combining spin crossover (SCO) and photoluminescence (PL), offering noncontact and highly sensitive spin&#8208;state detection, are promising candidates for application in photonic devices. However, independently tuning the SCO and PL properties to achieve synergistic SCO&#8208;PL behavior remains challenging. Herein, we present a series of heteroleptic Fe(II) coordination compounds with the general formula [Fe(L)4(RCN)2](ClO4)2&#8226;nRCN, bearing four BODIPY&#8208;derived fluorophores L (L&#160;=&#160;4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,3,5,7&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;8&#8208;[(1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methyl]&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene) in the equatorial positions and variable RCN co&#8208;ligands (CH3CH2CN, CH2CHCN, CH3(CH2)2CN, PhCN) in the apical positions. The systematic variation of the co&#8208;ligand modulates steric and/or electronic effects, thereby influencing the SCO behavior without perturbing the PL characteristics. Magnetic susceptibility measurements revealed T1/2 =&#160;220&#160;K and 270&#160;K for R&#160;=&#160;CH3CH2 and R&#160;=&#160;CH2CH, respectively, indicating that electronic effects modulate T1/2. Conversely, for R&#160;=&#160;Ph and R&#160;=&#160;CH3(CH2)2 the SCO capability is progressively lost, with the latter showing no spin&#8208;switching at all. Temperature&#8208;dependent PL studies display an increase in emission upon the SCO, most pronounced for [Fe(L)4(CH3CH2CN)2](ClO4)2&#8226;2CH3CH2CN, which can be attributed to electronic coupling between the SCO center and the fluorophore. This work establishes a single&#8208;molecule SCO&#8208;PL platform, in which the SCO behavior can be tuned independently from the PL response, paving the way for tailored molecular sensors and optical switches.

Proton conducting tetraphenylene molecules (ImTP) containing a imidazole group were controlled by the degree of protonation. By controlling the degree of protonation from neutral ImTP to H1ImTP&#8314;, H2ImTP2&#8314;, and H4ImTP&#8308;&#8314;, we demonstrated that the balance between intermolecular hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions affects structural stability and proton conductivity.








Abstract
The control of crystal structure and proton conductivity was evaluated by stepwise protonation of tetraphenylene molecules (ImTP) containing a imidazole group. By controlling the degree of protonation from neutral ImTP to H1ImTP&#8314;, H2ImTP2&#8314;, and H4ImTP&#8308;&#8314;, we demonstrated that the balance between intermolecular hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions affects structural stability and proton conductivity. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed that neutral ImTP forms a 2D hydrogen bond network, while H1ImTP&#8314; exhibits enhanced structural stability due to N&#9472;H&#8314;&#183;&#183;&#183;Cl&#8722; electrostatic interactions. H2ImTP2&#8314; forms a 3D network, and H4ImTP&#8308;&#8314; becomes amorphous. Under 40% relative humidity conditions, these compounds adsorb H2O to form proton conduction pathways, exhibiting conductivities of 3.20&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;7, 3.38&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;6, 1.35&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;6, and 6.20&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;6 S cm&#8722;1 at &#8764;363&#160;K for n&#160;=&#160;0, 1, 2, and 4 of HnImTPn&#8314;Cl&#8722;n system, respectively. In particular, H1ImTP&#8314; exhibits an optimal balance between hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, resulting in high structural stability, reversible H2O adsorption, and proton conductivity.

Natural rhodochrosite as a catalyst with unique activity in methane oxidation.








Abstract
Rhodochrosite, a naturally occurring MnCO3${\rm MnCO}_3$&#8208;based mineral with inherent compositional complexity, is investigated as a catalyst for methane oxidation. The material exhibits distinctive catalytic behavior, including enhanced C2${\rm C}_2$ hydrocarbon formation and selective CO production, attributed to its multielemental composition and dynamic phase transformations under reaction conditions. In particular, rhodochrosite suppresses CO formation while enhancing C2H4${\rm C}_2{\rm H}_4$ production compared to pure MnCO3${\rm MnCO}_3$, the primary component of rhodochrosite. Thermal treatment converts rhodochrosite into mixed manganese oxide phases (Mn2O3${\rm Mn}_2{\rm O}_3$, Mn3O4${\rm Mn}_3{\rm O}_4$), while trace elements and mineral impurities are retained and may influence oxide phase evolution and catalytic behavior. These findings highlight the potential of natural multicomponent minerals as compositionally diverse, phase&#8208;adaptive platforms for selective methane&#160;conversion.

         <title>Substituent Effects on Sulfur Phenolate Exchange Reactions: Reactivity and Bonding Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Orbital interactions, and to smaller effect: solvent effects, dominate over Pauli repulsions to determine the success of the SuPhenEx click reaction.








Abstract
The Sulfur Phenolate Exchange reaction (SuPhenEx) provides a fluorine&#8208;free alternative S(VI) exchange chemistry by substituting nitrophenolate as the leaving group instead of fluoride (as in SuFEx reactions), offering a synthetically appealing and environmentally friendly approach in click chemistry. Despite its significance, the reaction mechanism and the underlying electronic interactions in the course of the reaction have yet to be thoroughly explored at the molecular level. Here, we elucidate the electronic interactions of a series of SuPhenEx model reactions between various para&#8208;substituted phenolates (p&#8208;R&#8208;Ph&#8208;O&#8211;) as nucleophiles and PhSO2&#8208;OPh&#8211;p&#8208;NO2 as an electrophile, in both gas and solvent (acetonitrile) phases. As tools, we apply the Activation Strain Model based on density functional theory. We identified the HOMO&#8211;LUMO interaction as the key determinant of reactivity in the gas phase, which shifts to include (HOMO&#8208;1)&#8211;(LUMO&#160;+&#160;1) contributions in the solvent phase, and showed how these interactions can be tuned through the choice of the substituent in the para&#8208;substituted phenolate nucleophiles. The resulting insights, consistent across both phases, facilitate steering future experiments in these and related S(VI) substitution reactions.

         <title>Hybridization on DNA&#8208;Coated Ultrasmall Gold Nanoparticles (2&#160;nm)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA&#8208;conjugated ultrasmall gold nanoparticles (2&#160;nm) hybridize with complementary DNA strands to form dimers. Covalent attachment via click chemistry preserves the DNA functionality, creating building blocks for supramolecular chemistry and controlled nanoparticle assembly.








Abstract
Ultrasmall gold nanoparticles were functionalized with covalently attached DNA strands of 20 or 30 nucleotides. This was achieved via click chemistry with alkyne&#8208;terminated DNA and azide&#8208;terminated gold nanoparticles. The particles were characterized by high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy, UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering. The DNA strands were fluorescently labelled with either FAM or Cy3, permitting their detection and quantification on the nanoparticle surface. Complementary DNA strands were attached to the nanoparticles via hybridization. The connection of gold nanoparticles by complementary DNA strands was also demonstrated. In&#8208;situ fluorescence spectroscopy confirmed the hybridization at ambient temperature and the melting of the DNA strands at elevated temperature. The hybridization was confirmed by fluorescence spectroscopy with the FRET effect. This opens broad possibilities for the noncovalent functionalization of ultrasmall nanoparticles.

         <title>Metal Chloride&#8208;Iodate Nonlinear Optical Materials via Direct Chlorination of Centrosymmetric Metal Iodate Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new simple method that structural directing agents anion could effectively regulate the orientation of polar basic building units to achieve centrosymmetric to noncentrosymmetric transformation is presented. The resultant three excellent NLO crystals of crystals RbAl(IO3)3Cl, CsAl(IO3)3Cl, and CsGa(IO3)3Cl were discovered.








Abstract
Noncentrosymmetric (NCS) crystals may show many interesting and important physical properties and wide applications in science and technology but they are rare in contrast to centrosymmetric crystals. The development of NCS crystals from known centrosymmetric (CS) crystals is of fundamental and applied importance. Herein, a simple and effective strategy that by addition of appropriate diluted HCl into CS crystals to react directly was proposed for the reversal of the CS to NCS structure by utilizing the structural directing agents Cl&#8722; anion to break the symmetry and then to regulate orientation and arrangement of anionic moieties. The resultant a family of NCS iodates AM(IO3)3Cl (A&#160;=&#160;Rb, Cs; M&#160;=&#160;Al, Ga, Fe) were successfully developed via Cl&#8722; anion&#8208; induced transformation from parent CS A2M(IO3)4(H0.5IO3)2 and Cs2Fe(HIO3)(IO3)5. Remarkably, Al&#8208; and Ga&#8208;based compounds RbAl(IO3)3Cl, CsAl(IO3)3Cl, and CsGa(IO3)3Cl exhibit the strong second harmonic generation (SHG) responses (11.0&#8211;12.5&#160;&#215;&#160;KDP), large band&#8211;gaps (4.00&#8211;4.17&#160;eV), high laser damage thresholds (LDTs), wide transparent wavelength regions, and easiness of growing up large crystal. This work provides a new perspective to develop important NCS crystals from CS crystals.

The resultant a family of NCS iodates AM(IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl (A&#160;=&#160;Rb, Cs; M&#160;=&#160;Al, Ga, Fe) were successfully developed via Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anion- induced transformation from parent CS A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;M(IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe(HIO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;. Remarkably, Al- and Ga-based compounds RbAl(IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl, CsAl(IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl, and CsGa(IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl exhibit the strong second harmonic generation (SHG) responses (11.0&#8211;12.5&#160;&#215;&#160;KDP), large band&#8211;gaps (4.00&#8211;4.17&#160;eV), high laser damage thresholds (LDTs), wide transparent wavelength regions, and easiness of growing up large crystal. This work provides a new perspective to develop important NCS crystals from CS crystals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanisms of Chiral Induction to Foldamer Backbones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helical foldamers are often built from achiral components and thus have no inherent bias to their twist sense. This review describes mechanisms for controlling their handedness using appended stereocenters. It examines how point chirality directs the twist sense through a combination of short&#8208;range interactions to the directly attached repeat unit and long&#8208;range interactions with groups farther along the backbone.








Abstract
Foldamers, oligomers that adopt well&#8208;defined conformations, represent an efficient strategy toward nanoscale structural complexity. While most foldamers fold into helices, many abiotic foldamers are built from achiral repeat units and therefore do not have a preferred twist sense. Their handedness can, however, be controlled by attaching groups with chirality centers to the foldamer backbone. This process allows chiral information from readily available compounds to be amplified into larger&#8208;scale structural asymmetry and translated into functional behavior. This review describes mechanisms whereby the point chirality of chiral &#8220;controller&#8221; groups directs foldamer twist sense. We highlight examples of aromatic oligoamides, oligohydrazides, oligoindoles, oligo(ortho&#8208;phenylenes), oligooxymethylenes, and oligo(aminoisobutyric acids), examining cases where the controller groups are attached at either the helices&#8217; termini or sides. Our emphasis is on applying intuitive concepts from conformational analysis and, where appropriate, computational modeling of small substructures. In each case, we consider first short&#8208;range interactions that orient the controller group relative to its direct point of attachment to the foldamer, and then its long&#8208;range interactions with more&#8208;distant parts of the oligomer. Together, these interactions allow the twist sense to be predicted (or at least rationalized). Understanding these mechanisms should facilitate the design of systems with dynamic control over helicity.

         <title>Syntheses and Reactivity of Yb and Sm Inverse Sandwich Arene Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of inverse sandwich&#160;lanthanide benzene complexes depends strongly on the metal oxidation states and consequently, the charge on the bridging benzene anion. Whereas the YbII complex reacted as a 2e donor with biphenyl, naphthalene, anthracene and COT, the strongly bound SmIII complex only reacted with anthracene and COT. 








Abstract
Inverse sandwich arene complexes of rare earth metals have gained notable interest due to their unique electronic properties. In these complexes, an arene ligand bridges two metal centres, storing 0, 2, or 4 electrons, which is the basis for unique reactivity. Herein, we report on the reactivity of [(DIPePBDI)Ln]2(&#951;6,&#951;6&#8208;benzene) (II&#8208;Ln, Ln&#160;=&#160;Yb or Sm) and in situ reduced [(DIPePBDI)SmI]2 (V) (DIPePBDI&#160;=&#160;HC[C(Me)N&#8208;DIPeP]2, DIPeP&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;CHEt2&#8208;phenyl). The YbII&#8208;benzene2&#8722;&#8208;YbII complex (II&#8208;Yb) reacted smoothly with biphenyl, naphthalene, anthracene, and COT, giving a range of new YbII complexes with bridging arene or COT ligands. However, due to much stronger Sm&#8208;arene bonding in II&#8208;Sm, which should be regarded as a SmIII&#8208;benzene4&#8722;&#8208;SmIII complex, this reagent only reacted with substrates that can be reduced easily (anthracene and COT). Interestingly, reaction with anthracene gave a SmII&#8208;anthracene2&#8722;&#8208;SmII complex, showing that the benzene4&#8722; is able to reduce SmIII to SmII. In situ reduced [(DIPePBDI)SmI]2 (V) can be considered a (DIPePBDI)SmI synthon, which reacted smoothly with toluene, biphenyl, or 1,3,5&#8208;triphenyl&#8208;benzene and affords a series of SmIII&#8208;arene4&#8722;&#8208;SmIII complexes. However, reaction with pyrene gave an SmII&#8208;pyrene2&#8722;&#8208;SmII product. All complexes have been fully characterized with X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Pitch&#8208;derived Soft and Hard Carbon Materials for Practical Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive overview of pitch&#8208;based soft and hard carbons for sodium&#8208;ion batteries from a practical viewpoint. It covers their preparation, structure, sodium storage mechanisms, and applications, while also discussing critical points such as safety and volumetric energy density. From an industrial perspective, we analyze technical hurdles and propose that combining advanced characterization with artificial intelligence is key to clarifying structure&#8208;property relationships for practical application.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion battery (SIB) shows great potential for large&#8208;scale energy storage, high&#8208;power and low&#8208;temperature supplies. Pitch is a promising precursor for preparing carbon anode materials for SIBs owing to its low cost, high carbon yield, and structural tunability. In this review, the preparation and application of pitch&#8208;derived soft&#8208; and hard&#8208;carbons for SIBs are discussed from a practical perspective. We first introduce the full&#8208;slope sodium storage behavior of soft carbon, mainly focused on the storage mechanism, high&#8208;rate feature, modification strategies, application scenario, and existing challenges. Thereafter, we present the preparation of pitch&#8208;derived hard carbon mainly through pre&#8208;oxidation and carbonization. The crucial influencing factors, including pitch property, pre&#8208;oxidation temperature, holding time, heating rate, atmosphere, and carbonization conditions, as well as the underlying mechanisms, are discussed. From scientific and industrial points of view, we also propose the challenges for application of pitch&#8208;derived carbon materials. Future efforts should be paid on clarifying the sodium storage mechanisms and electrochemical kinetics of carbon, revealing the screening criteria of pitch and the &#8220;preparation&#8208;structure&#8208;performance&#8221; relationships through a combination of experiments, artificial intelligence, and big data techniques. Material design and preparation guidance should be obtained to push forward pitch&#8208;based carbon for practical SIBs.

         <title>Moisture&#8208;enabled Electricity Generation From a Single&#8208;layer Composite CNT&#8208;Polymer Membrane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work focuses on the development of single&#8208;layer composite membranes containing a hydrophilic polymeric matrix enriched with various types of carbon nanotubes (single&#8208;, double&#8208;, and multi&#8208;walled CNTs), through an environmentally benign process. The membranes hold potential as low&#8208;budget and self&#8208;sustaining energy systems in the field of moisture&#8208;enabled electricity generators (MEGs).








Abstract
Clean and renewable power sources are crucial toward the development of sustainable energy technologies, to address the global energy demand. Moisture&#8208;enabled electricity generators (MEGs) have emerged as promising candidates to harness ambient low&#8208;grade energy stored in the humidity of the atmosphere. In this study, single&#8208;layer composite membranes were developed, consisting of a hydrophilic cross&#8208;linked polymeric matrix of sodium poly(4&#8208;styrene sulfonate&#8208;co&#8208;glycidyl methacrylate) (P(SSNa&#8208;co&#8208;GMA)) and polyacrylic acid (PAA), and incorporating various types of carbon nanotubes (single&#8208;, double&#8208;, and multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes). These composite membranes can spontaneously absorb humidity and display mixed conductivity in a range of relative humidity (RH) environments. The combination of high swelling capacity, hydrophilic surface, and interconnected nanoscale pathways facilitates the formation of a strong ion concentration gradient under humid conditions, leading to higher and more stable voltage output. For example, MEGs based on MWCNTs reaches &#8764;0.65&#160;V. These findings indicate the importance of fine&#8208;tuned morphology and nanotube dispersion in designing efficient MEG devices, as low&#8208;cost and self&#8208;sustaining energy systems.

         <title>Biodegradation of Benzene&#8208;Dicarboxylic Acid Ester Isomers by a Thermally Activated Esterase from Desulfurellaceae Bacterium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The newly identified esterase DeEst catalyzes the hydrolysis of three regioisomers of benzene&#8208;dicarboxylic acid esters. In particular, phthalic acid esters (PAEs) can be converted into phthalic acid (PA). DeEst exhibits thermostability and an uncommon thermal activation effect.








Abstract
Esterases play a crucial role in the degradation of phthalic acid esters (PAEs), the common persistent organic pollutants and endocrine disrupting chemicals. However, only a few esterases for PAEs degradation have been characterized. In this study, a novel esterase from Desulfurellaceae bacterium (DeEst) has been identified. We found its hydrolytic activity toward three regioisomers of benzene&#8208;dicarboxylic acid esters (i.e., diethyl phthalate, diethyl isophthalate, and diethyl terephthalate). Notably, DeEst is capable of hydrolyzing diethyl phthalate and other PAEs to phthalic acid (PA). The biochemical characterization of DeEst was also investigated. DeEst exhibited strong thermal stability and demonstrated an uncommon thermal activation effect, highlighting its considerable potential for practical applications.

         <title>Catalytic and Photoluminescence Properties of the First&#8208; and Second&#8208;Sphere Coordination of Lanthanide Complexes</title>

The Michael donor and the Michael acceptor are activated via hydrogen bonding interactions within the second&#8208;sphere coordination of europium complexes.








Abstract
The efficient binding of receptors Lk (Lk&#160;=&#160;L5&#8208;L8) to [Eu(hfac)3] (H&#8208;hfac&#160;=&#160;1,1,1,5,5,5&#8208;hexafluoropentane&#8208;2,4&#8208;dione) allows (i) to gather the basic unit&#8208;containing tridentate ligands Lk and the acidic unit&#8208;bearing bidentate hfac&#8722; co&#8208;ligands into a stable single molecular [LkEu(hfac)3] adduct working as a catalyst for Michael C&#9472;C bond formations, (ii) to enhance the acidity of the N&#8208;H units connected to the benzimidazole side arms of the bound ligands L5 and L7, and (iii) to reorganize their geometries into cis&#8208;cis conformation for activating Michael substrates 1 and 2 through H&#8208;bonding interactions on the second&#8208;sphere coordination to provide the target product 3 (up to 92% yield). A maximum enantiomeric excess of 21% could be achieved due to the long distance between the chiral sources and the catalytic sites in the europium complexes. Stepwise distortions from planarity of the terdentate Lk ligands in the yttrium complexes [LkY(hfac)3] (Lk&#160;=&#160;L2, L3, and L5&#8208;L10) can be tuned by addition of specific substituent into the benzimidazole side arms, thus realizing some control over their dual fluorescence and phosphorescence emission properties. All [LkEu(hfac)3] (Lk&#160;=&#160;L2, L3, and L5&#8208;L10) complexes display europium&#8208;centered photoluminescence properties induced by the antenna effect and modulated by the specific design of the light&#8208;harvesting aromatic ligand located in the first coordination sphere.

         <title>Enantioselective Desymmetrization by Chiral Bifunctional H&#8208;Bonding Organocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective desymmetrization has emerged as a highly efficient and conceptually elegant strategy for the construction of chiral molecules from readily available prochiral substrates. This review focuses on recent developments in organocatalytic desymmetrization reactions, with particular emphasis on approaches involving bifunctional activation through hydrogen bonding.








Abstract
Enantioselective desymmetrization has emerged as an effective method for generating highly enriched chiral molecules from achiral compounds. In recent years, organocatalysis has played an increasingly prominent role in this field, offering metal&#8208;free and environmentally benign alternatives to traditional asymmetric catalysis. This review focuses on organocatalytic approaches in desymmetrization reactions that utilize bifunctional hydrogen activation of the substrate by a chiral organocatalyst. The most common types of chiral bifunctional organocatalysts include cinchona alkaloids and their derivatives, such as thioureas, sulfonamides, and squaramides. The following text provides an overview of the enantioselective desymmetrization methods that have been described to date for meso&#8208;anhydrides, meso&#8208;diols, amines, small heterocyclic rings, and various carbonyl compound derivatives.

         <title>Tailoring Pore Size in Anionic MOFs Toward Enhanced Selective Adsorption of Organic Dye Pollutants</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pore size of MOFs can be successfully adjusted by altering the solvent and temperature of the reaction. The adsorption isotherm results of the cationic dye methylene blue show that the maximum adsorption capacity of the optimized MOF increased by approximately 2.45 times.








Abstract
Organic dye pollutants pose a serious threat to ecosystems and human health, whereas there still exist challenges in efficient and selective adsorption of them due to the difficulty in structure tunability of traditional adsorption materials. Based on the tailorable pore structure of anionic metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), the pore size can be optimized to match the dye molecules through a solvothermal control strategy, thereby achieving efficient adsorption. Herein, the pore size of anionic MOFs was modulated by varying solvents and temperature, facilitating high&#8208;performance selective adsorption of cationic dye via a large&#8208;pore size effect. The optimized MOF (Bio&#8208;MOF&#8208;100) of large pore size achieved a methylene blue adsorption capacity is high to 443.01&#160;mg/g, which is approximately 2.45 times higher than that of the MOF (Bio&#8208;MOF&#8208;1) before pore regulation. Using a mixed matrix membrane (MMM) strategy, the optimized MOF was mixed with polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) to form a membrane. The membrane is not only portable and recyclable, but also inherits the characteristics of MOFs, enabling selective adsorption of cationic dyes. Its maximum adsorption capacity for methylene blue is 141.78&#160;mg/g. These results provide an example for the design and utility of largely&#8208;pore MOFs for targeted pollutants adsorption.

         <title>Low&#8208; Temperature Transformations in Amorphous Silica Bilayers on Ru(0001) After Crystal&#8208;Glass Transition: Closer Look</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work we report on the ring opening of the silica film as studied by fast&#8208;scanning scanning tunneling microscopy together with density functional calculations. The results reveal the influence of the metal support on the transformation energetics.








Abstract
The crystal&#8208;glass transition concerning silicon dioxide has been a topic of intense research. It has been possible to prepare a bilayer silica film on a metal substrate and study the corresponding transition in real space using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). While the initial trigger of the transition has been identified as a so&#8208;called Stone&#8211;Wales ring&#8208;opening process, which requires rather high energies/temperatures, a question has been, whether there are similar follow&#8208;up processes, which require much less energy and thus rather moderate temperatures. Although observations have been reported using electron microscopy, it remains unclear whether, in this case, the modifications were initiated by the measurement itself. Here, we report on a fast&#8208;scanning STM study, allowing a study in real space and indicating structural transformations at room temperature. The experimental results are supported by demanding density functional calculations, which allow for an understanding of the involved ring structure modifying processes. The calculations also reveal the influence of the metal support on the transformation energetics.

The graphical abstract summarizes the review &#8220;Pd(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Strategies for the &#946;&#8208;Arylation of &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids: An Overview&#8221;, highlighting representative Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed methods for the &#946;&#8208;arylation of &#945;&#8208;amino acids. Key mechanistic features, substrate diversity, and synthetic relevance of these transformations are showcased.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;H activation has been linked to amino acids for decades. Peptides and &#945;$\alpha $&#8208;amino acids (&#945;&#8208;AAs) have been used as substrates, directing groups (DGs) and ligands, significantly expanding and broadening the definition of metallo&#8208; and organo&#8208;catalysis. This mini&#8208;review focuses on strategies for &#946;&#8208;arylation of &#945;&#8208;AAs involving Pd(II)&#8208;mediated activation of the &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H sigma bond. After a brief introduction in Section 1, strategies exploiting auxiliary bidentate DGs to address the Pd(II)&#8208;mediated C&#9472;H activation are discussed in Section 2. The related Ligand&#8208;controlled processes are treated in Section 3 and Section 4 highlight the most recent atom&#8208;economic developments in peptide late&#8208;stage functionalization (LSF) proceeding via Pd(II)&#8208;mediated &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H activation of a precise &#945;$\alpha $&#8208;AA residue along the peptide sequence.

         <title>Enantioselective Catalytic 1,2&#8208;Benzoxazolyl Migration for Tertiary &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Ester Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral Lewis acid and bifunctional squaramide&#8208;catalyzed enantioconvergent benzilic ester rearrangement of &#945;&#8208;diketones has been developed, enabling the construction of optically active tertiary &#945;&#8208;hydroxy esters with high enantioselectivity and functional group versatility, along with the synthesis of a novel chiral Boox ligand for asymmetric electrocatalysis, while DFT calculations elucidated the hemiketal&#8208;initiated mechanism and key transition states governing enantioselectivity.








Abstract
Asymmetric catalytic rearrangement, particularly the enantioselective benzilic ester rearrangement of &#945;&#8208;diketones, represents a potent synthetic tool for cleaving C&#9472;C bonds to generate optically active tertiary &#945;&#8208;hydroxy esters. However, enantioselective benzilic ester rearrangement involving a 1,2&#8208;heterocycle shift presents significant challenges owing to inadequate enantiomeric differentiation and steric hindrance associated with tertiary alcohols. In this study, we employed chiral Lewis acid and bifunctional squaramide catalysts for enantioconvergent benzilic ester rearrangement, achieving high enantioselectivity in the construction of tertiary alcohols with chemically versatile functional groups and the synthesis of a novel chiral benzoxazole&#8211;oxazoline (Boox) ligand for asymmetric electrocatalysis. DFT calculations elucidated a hemiketal&#8208;initiated reaction mechanism, pivotal 1,2&#8208;heterocycle shift transition states, and catalytic interactions that govern the increased enantioselectivity of the enantioconvergent benzilic ester rearrangement, furnishing crucial insights into the underlying mechanism.

         <title>Double&#8208;Network Soy Protein Adhesives with Enhanced Water Retention and Bonding Strength</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hierarchical dual&#8208;network soy protein adhesive combines chitosan's compliant supramolecular network (hydrogen bonding/electrostatic interactions) for 430% enhanced precure water retention with a stiff covalent crosslinked network formed during curing for 445% improved postcure bonding strength, successfully resolving the traditional trade&#8208;off between these properties in bio&#8208;based adhesives.








Abstract
Developing soy protein adhesives with high water retention and strong bonding strength is essential. Such materials can serve as a sustainable alternative to petroleum&#8208;based formaldehyde adhesives in wood panel manufacturing. However, a trade&#8208;off between precure water retention and postcure bonding strength remains a major challenge, and current strategies rarely achieve simultaneous enhancement of both properties. Inspired by the multi&#8208;enhancement mechanisms of double&#8209;network systems, we established a hierarchical dual&#8209;network adhesive system. It involves the self&#8208;assembly of chitosan into a compliant supramolecular framework via dynamic hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, along with the additional formation of a stiff covalent crosslinked network during curing. This design achieves synergistic optimization of water retention and bonding strength. The &#8220;skeleton&#8211;tentacle&#8221; structure formed by functionalized chitosan significantly enhanced water retention by 430% and was crucial to forming the dual&#8208;network structure, improving wet shear strength by 445% and work of adhesion by 2133%. Additionally, the adhesive exhibited excellent mildew resistance and flame retardancy. The global warming potential was only 1.4&#160;kg CO2 eq, significantly lower than urea&#8211;formaldehyde and phenol&#8211;formaldehyde resins. This design provides a novel approach for developing high&#8208;performance bio&#8208;based adhesives and is expected to advance its practical application.

         <title>Variability of a Non&#8208;Centrosymmetric Tecto&#8208;Borosulfate: Introduction of Various Molecular Cations into BiX[B(SO4)2]4 (X&#160; = &#160;H3O+, NO2+, NH4+, NO+)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To date, Bi(H3O)[B(SO)2]4 is only the second structure type containing a 3D anion within borosulfate chemistry. In this contribution three more representatives were synthesized, formally replacing oxonium by the molecular cations nitrosonium, nitronium, and ammonium. The structures crystallize homeotypically to the very first compound. A careful adjustment of the educts even allows mixed representatives.








Abstract
Although the number of borosulfates increased strongly over the past years, structures comprising a 3D anionic framework are still scarce. Herein, with BiX[B(SO4)2]4 (X&#160; = &#160;NH4+, NO2+, NO+) we present three new representatives. The bismuth borosulfates were synthesized under solvothermal condition and crystallize homeotypically to Bi(H3O)[B(SO4)2]4 in the tetragonal space group I4&#175;$\bar 4$ (Nr.82) (a&#160;=&#160;11.827(6) &#8211; 11.908(1) &#197;, c&#160;=&#160;8.1160(2) &#8211; 8.1315(6) &#197;, Z&#160;=&#160;2). Via all vertices connected BS4 supertetrahedra reveal a zeolite type like structure like its found for the tectosilicate K1.14[Mg0.57Si1.43O4] emphasizing their close relationship. Underlining the weak coordination behavior, for the first&#8208;time nitrosonium and nitrosylium cations are introduced into borosulfate chemistry. SHG measurements confirm the absence of an inversion center and show a nonlinear optical response with intensities up to 1.4 times higher than KDP. Furthermore, the titled compounds were characterized thoroughly by both single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and thermal analysis.

         <title>Cyclopenta&#8208;Fused Polyaromatic Hydrocarbon (CP&#8208;PAH) Radicals: Synthesis, Characterization, and Quantum Chemical Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extending the &#960; system of a fully conjugated framework composed of alternating five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered rings led to further rare examples of bench&#8208;stable carbon&#8208;centered hydrocarbon radicals. Spectroscopic analysis allowed extensive characterization, which was further supported by computational methods.








Abstract
Two air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable cyclopenta&#8208;fused polyaromatic hydrocarbon (CP&#8208;PAH) radicals with six six&#8208; and three five&#8208;membered rings alternately fused to nonacycles were obtained by ortho fusion in suitably ortho,ortho&#8217;&#8208;substituted dinaphthylfluorenes and subsequent establishment of the conjugation. The radicals were obtained in five consecutive steps with total yields of 38 and 16%, respectively; key steps are Suzuki couplings and cyclizing SEAr reactions. Mesityl substituents at the five&#8208;membered rings ensure the kinetic stability of the radicals. They were characterized by EPR and UV/Vis spectroscopy. Quantum chemical calculations led to simulated UV/Vis/NIR spectra and disclosed further properties like spin densities, aromaticity, and orbital energies. Both radicals are best described with the unpaired electron centered in the outer five&#8208;membered rings. The respective resonance formulas show the largest number of fully intact benzene rings. A possible triradical character was computed to be small in both compounds. The five&#8208;membered rings, especially the central rings show significant antiaromatic character.

         <title>An Improved Cysteine&#8208;Based Labeling Strategy for GPCR Structural Dynamics Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a strategy to achieve high specificity cysteine&#8208;based labeling of GPCRs by employing phenylarsine oxide to reversibly protect extracellular labile disulfides. This method efficiently reduces nonspecific labeling and enables receptor sample preparations with controllable disulfide redox states, facilitating further spectroscopic studies on GPCR structural dynamics.








Abstract
Spectroscopic investigations of the dynamic signaling process of G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs) often require cysteine&#8208;based labeling. However, the presence of a highly conserved but labile disulfide bond in the receptor extracellular domain could result in strong background signals, hindering the application of spectroscopic methods in studying GPCR dynamics. Herein we report an improved strategy for site&#8208;specific labeling of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors by using phenylarsine oxide (PAO) to reversibly protect the conserved disulfide bond. This method can efficiently reduce background signals while maintaining receptor functionality, enabling both fluorophore and 19F labeling for structural dynamics studies of the M2 muscarinic receptor (M2R) by single&#8208;molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) and 19F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). This improved strategy is anticipated to broaden the applicability of cysteine&#8208;based spectroscopic methods for structural dynamics studies of a wider range of GPCRs facing similar challenges.

         <title>Unraveling an Organic Soluble Precursor&#8208;Based Low&#8208;Temperature Synthetic Strategy to Impurity&#8208;Free Pristine and Transition Metal Doped Lead Apatites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a mild, one&#8208;step, low&#8208;temperature hydrothermal synthesis of lead hydroxyapatite (Pb&#8208;HA) and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;doped Pb&#8208;HA using [Pb(&#956;&#8208;dtbp)2]n as the molecular precursor. This method prevents impurity formation, ensures selectivity, and yields paramagnetic TM&#8208;doped Pb&#8208;HA, offering a more efficient alternative to existing approaches.








Abstract
Doping of hydroxyapatites has garnered considerable interest, as it enables the tuning of the material's intrinsic properties. However, synthesizing hydroxyapatites and their doped variants is highly challenging, as the synthesis demands high temperature and complex, multi&#8208;step reaction conditions. Hence, we propose a soft, one&#8208;step synthetic approach to develop single&#8208;phase lead hydroxyapatite (Pb&#8208;HA), Pb10(PO4)6(OH)2, and transition metal&#8208;doped lead hydroxyapatites (TM&#8208;doped Pb&#8208;HA), Pb10&#8208;xMx(PO4)6(OH)2 (x &#8771; 0.5 to 1.0) (M&#160;=&#160;Cu, Co, or Mn) through a low&#8208;temperature hydrothermal decomposition route under neutral conditions. A newly synthesized 1D lead phosphate polymer [Pb(&#956;&#8208;dtbp)2]n (1) (dtbp&#160;=&#160;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphate) has been used as the metal&#8208;organic precursor for different lead phosphate phases by employing both solvothermal and solid&#8208;state thermal decomposition pathways. Hydrothermal decomposition of 1 in the presence of required stoichiometric amounts of an additional lead precursor, PbO, and transition phosphates/metal oxides (MO) at 140 &#176;C gave phase&#8208;pure Pb&#8208;HA and TM&#8208;doped Pb&#8208;HA. The associated magnetic and electronic property analysis revealed that all the synthesized materials display paramagnetic behavior, and they are wide&#8208;gap n&#8208;type semiconductors. More pertinently, this mild, versatile route offers improved control over the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand ratio compared to existing methods and can be adapted to introduce other divalent transition metals into hydroxyapatite frameworks.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study provides a three&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy for the generation of nitrite under physiological conditions, measurement of glutathione levels, and determination of the relative amounts of nitric oxide derived from endogenous and exogenous sources.








Abstract
The conversion of nitrite (NO2&#8722;) to nitric oxide (NO) represents a key pathway for NO generation under ischemic conditions. Therefore, organic nitro compounds capable of releasing nitrite under physiological environments have attracted considerable attention. Here, we demonstrate that simple 4&#8208;nitro&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide derivatives efficiently and almost quantitatively liberate nitrite upon reaction with biological thiols, particularly glutathione (GSH). These compounds function as NO prodrugs, enhancing NO bioavailability in mammalian cells through intracellular nitrite&#8211;to&#8211;NO conversion. Notably, their selectivity toward GSH and the intrinsic fluorescence of the resulting glutathione adducts enable their use as probes for monitoring intracellular GSH levels. Furthermore, cotreatment of endothelial cells with these naphthalimide derivatives and the NO probe DAF&#8208;FM diacetate provides a valuable strategy to distinguish between endogenously produced NO and NO generated via synthetic nitro compound&#8211;derived nitrite release. Together, these findings highlight 4&#8208;nitro&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimides as a promising platform for both NO delivery and real&#8208;time cellular redox sensing.

         <title>Shedding Light on Synthetic Autocatalysis: From Conventional Closed&#8208;Shell Chemistries to Overlooked Open&#8208;Shell Occurrences</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Why add another catalyst when the product itself holds the power to catalyze its own formation? Autocatalysis in synthetic chemistry enhances reaction efficiency and uncovers novel catalytic behavior across both closed&#8208;shell and open&#8208;shell systems, expanding reactivity and enabling innovative design strategies.








Abstract
Autocatalysis is a kinetic phenomenon where a reaction product catalyzes its own formation, often leading to sigmoidal reaction profiles and exponential rate acceleration. This process plays a fundamental role in biological systems, for example, in chemistry of the origins of life. Although synthetic reactions are not as widely reported as the biological studies, autocatalysis offers a unique mechanism and high efficiency to organic synthesis. This review highlights diverse synthetic examples in various autocatalytic mechanistic paradigms, including well&#8208;studied examples such as the Soai reaction. We also explore emerging examples in radical&#8208; and photochemistry&#8208;based systems, emphasizing recent advances in auto&#8208;photocatalysis. By exploring examples from different fields, this review aims to highlight the variety and potential of autocatalytic reactions for synthesis. We aim to encourage further research into autocatalysis as a powerful strategy for improving reaction efficiency, revealing new reaction pathways, and inspiring innovative catalytic methodologies.

         <title>Water&#8208;Soluble Squaraine&#8208;Based NIR Chromofluorogenic Probe for HClO/ClO&#8722; Detection in Environmental Waters and Live&#8208;Cell Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;infrared (696/725&#160;nm), water&#8208;soluble squaraine dye SO3SQ was presented for the chromofluorogenic detection of HClO/ClO&#8722;. SO3SQ detects HClO/ClO&#8722; in 100% PBS system and exhibits visible colorimetric change, high selectivity, pH&#8208;independence and negligible cytotoxicity. SO3SQ is successfully used to detect HClO/ClO&#8722; in environmental water and enables fluorescence imaging of exogenous/endogenous HClO/ClO&#8722; in live HepG2 cells.








Abstract
Hypochlorous acid/hypochlorite (HClO/ClO&#8722;), as critical biological reactive oxygen species (ROS), plays essential roles in numerous physiological and pathological processes. To enable sensitive detection of HClO/ClO&#8722; in environmental water samples and living cells, a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) water&#8208;soluble squaraine&#8208;based chromofluorogenic probe SO3SQ was developed. SO3SQ exhibits good water solubility, NIR detection wavelength (696&#160;nm/725&#160;nm), high selectivity, rapid response time (within seconds), visible colorimetric response, and minimal cytotoxicity. Furthermore, SO3SQ achieved quantitative HClO/ClO&#8722; detection in environmental water samples and realized real&#8208;time fluorescence imaging of exogenous/endogenous HClO/ClO&#8722; in HepG2 cells. This work provides new ideas for the future design of NIR water&#8208;soluble HClO/ClO&#8722; probes, while expanding the application of squaraine dyes as HClO/ClO&#8722; probes.

         <title>Modular Assembly of Macrocyclic Sulfonamides via Consecutive Cascade Ring Expansion Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methods for the efficient synthesis of macrocyclic sulfur(IV) compounds are rare. In this manuscript, a versatile strategy for the synthesis of macrocyclic sulfonamides is described using a modular three&#8208;stage protocol, including two consecutive cascade ring expansion reactions. The utility of this modular approach is showcased via the synthesis of a library of 42 diversely functionalized 13&#8208; and 14&#8208;membered macrocyclic sulfonamides.








Abstract
Sulfur(IV) groups and macrocycles are both important motifs in bioactive molecules of significant current interest in medicinal chemistry, but methods for the efficient synthesis of macrocyclic sulfur(IV) compounds are rare. In this manuscript, a modular, versatile strategy for the synthesis of macrocyclic sulfonamides is described, using consecutive ring expansion reactions. First, linear starting materials are assembled from simple building blocks. This is followed by two distinct cascade ring expansion reaction steps performed in sequence. The utility of this modular approach is showcased via the synthesis of a library of 42 diversely functionalized 13&#8208; and 14&#8208;membered macrocyclic sulfonamides. The use of consecutive ring expansions is key to the success of the protocol, ensuring the products are formed in overall good yields without requiring high&#8208;dilution conditions.

         <title>A [3]Rotaxane Containing {Ti7Ga} Rings Linking CuII: Synthesis, Structure, and Spectroscopic Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extended hybrid inorganic&#8208;organic [2]&#8208; and [3]&#8208;rotaxanes are reported based on heterometallic rings with threads that link CuII complexes; the crystal structures are reported, and the solution behavior is investigated by double electron electron resonance spectroscopy methods.








Abstract
We report the synthesis of extended hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic rotaxanes based on (pyCH2NH2CH2CH2py)[TiIV7GaIIIO8(O2CtBu)16] (1) and (pyCH2NH2CH2py)[TiIV7GaIIIO8(O2CtBu)16] (3) building blocks, containing an anionic macrocycle and doubly pyridyl&#8208;terminated secondary ammonium threads. Reaction of 1 and 3 with [Cu(hfac)2] (hfac&#160;=&#160;1,1,1,5,5,5&#8208;hexafluoroacetylacetonate) gives {[Cu(hfac)2]3[1]2} (2) and {[Cu(hfac)2]2[3]} (4), respectively, which are characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. The products are controlled by the differing steric demands imposed by the two arms of the thread. The structure of 2 is an extended [3]rotaxane, with two molecules of 1 binding to a central [Cu(hfac)2] molecule via the longer arm of the thread, and two [Cu(hfac)2] units terminating the structure at the shorter arm. The structure of 4, where both arms of the thread are short, is an extended [2]rotaxane terminated by two molecules of [Cu(hfac)2]. The Cu&#8230;Cu&#8230;Cu fragment in 2 is linear, with the central Cu lying on an inversion center and with a separation between the terminal copper ions of 31.3&#160;&#197;. Double Electron&#8208;Electron Resonance (DEER; also known as PELDOR) spectroscopy proves that the [3]rotaxane structure remains intact in solution, detecting both terminal&#8230;center and terminal&#8230;terminal Cu&#8230;Cu interactions, with orientation&#8208;selective measurements demonstrating that there is a rearrangement of the structure at the terminal positions on dissolution.

         <title>Unraveling the Ruthenium(VIII)&#8208;Mediated Oxidation of N&#8208;Hydroxy Pyrrolidines to Cyclic Nitrones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidation of N&#8208;hydroxy pyrrolidines to cyclic nitrones with ruthenium tetroxide proceeds via a concerted mechanism with a defined two&#8208;electron transfer direction. In 3&#8208;substituted derivatives, regioselectivity is mainly controlled by the steric hindrance of the substituent. Radical or stepwise pathways are ruled out by calculations.








Abstract
The oxidation of N&#8208;hydroxypyrrolidines to cyclic nitrones represents a valuable transformation in organic synthesis due to the synthetic utility of such nitrones. In this work, we present a detailed computational study of the oxidation of five&#8208;membered N&#8208;hydroxylamines using ruthenium tetroxide. Through density functional theory (DFT) calculations complemented by topological analyses of the electron localization function (ELF), we reveal a concerted yet highly asynchronous two&#8208;electron transfer mechanism. No intermediates as energy minima are identified, but the reaction trajectory lies near the borderline between stepwise and concerted pathways. Our findings indicate that regioselectivity in the oxidation process does not correlate with the electronic nature of the substituent at position 3, but is instead governed by steric hindrance effects that modulate the approach of the ruthenium tetroxide moiety. This steric control provides a rational explanation for the modest regioselectivity observed experimentally. Notably, the computational predictions align closely with experimental product distributions, lending strong support to the proposed mechanistic model.

         <title>Balgacyclamide A: Structural Revision of the First Reported Total Synthesis and Evaluation of Oxazoline Synthesis via &#946;&#8208;Hydroxy Amides Dehydrative Cyclization Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic pathway for balgacyclamide A has been developed over 21 synthetic steps with an overall 5% yield. In this route, the absolute stereochemistry via the dehydrative cyclization is established, which helps to shed insight into errors within a previous groups claim of the total synthesis of balgacyclamide A. An epimer was also constructed to further our route via the dehydrative cyclization.








Abstract
A total synthesis of balgacyclamide A was reported for the first time in 2020, however, after multiple epimerization studies of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy amides dehydrative cyclization to access oxazolines, we proposed a configurational reassignment from the previous synthetic pathway. Balgacyclamide A is a macrocyclic hexapeptide with antiparasitic activity against Plasmodium falciparum and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. Chemically, its core contains six amino acids that undergo heterocyclization to form one thiazole and two oxazoline rings. Two of the six amino acids are L&#8208;threonines that play an important role in their synthetic pathway to achieve oxazolines with the right configuration upon epimerization at the &#946;&#8208;carbon. Thus, we investigated the effect of L&#8208;threonine and L&#8208;allothreonine &#946;&#8208;carbon epimerization via the Burgess reagent, diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST), and (NH4)6Mo7O24&#8226;4H2O catalyst to support previous oxazoline synthetic studies. Furthermore, the first total synthesis of balgacyclamide A and an epimer is reported via multiple synthetic key steps that involve a tandem sulfur incorporation, cyclization, and aromatization of the thiazole, and a late&#8208;stage &#946;&#8208;hydroxy amide Walden inversion to access both oxazolines.

         <dc:description>
A quinonoidal dipyrrolyldiketone boron complex with an orthogonally arranged catechol unit in the dianionic form exhibited diradical properties, as observed from the singlet&#8211;triplet energy gaps (&#916;EST) that were modulated by coexisting countercations. &#916;EST values were controlled by the bridging boron moieties in the dianion diradicals.








Abstract
A quinonoidal dipyrrolyldiketone catecholate&#8208;boron complex, with two pyrrole&#8208;quinonemethide moieties bridged by a six&#8208;membered cross&#8208;conjugated unit, was synthesized to modulate the diradical character of the dianion formed upon deprotonation. The dianionic species exhibited near&#8208;infrared absorption and electron spin resonance (ESR) signals, confirming the diradical properties. Variable&#8208;temperature (VT) ESR spectra suggest the thermal excitation from the ground&#8208;state singlet diradical to the triplet diradical, providing singlet&#8211;triplet energy gaps modulated by coexisting cations and bridging boron moieties.

         <title>Enhanced Ring&#8208;Opening Efficiency of Fluorescence Photochromic Switches Based on Benzo[e]&#8208;Fused Dimethyldihydropyrene</title>

         <dc:description>
Fluorophore&#8208;BDHP conjugates demonstrate enhanced visible&#8208;light photoswitching through effective energy transfer. These robust molecular switches also operate in polymer thin film, facilitating solid&#8208;matrix photoisomerization. The strategy provides a flexible platform for advanced photonic and optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Fluorophores have a significant impact on the photoswitching efficiency of photochromic systems such as azobenzene, dithienylethene, and spiropyrans by facilitating energy transfer processes that modulate the photoisomerization dynamics. In this study, we investigate the effect of side&#8208;chain functionalization of benzo[e]&#8208;fused dimethyldihydropyrene (BDHP) photochromic system with carefully selected fluorophores, namely anthracene and coumarin, on the ring&#8208;opening photoisomerization efficiency to the corresponding cyclophanediene (BCPD) form. The corresponding phenyl and naphthyl derivatives and the unsubstituted parent BDHP were studied as controls. Comprehensive photophysical analyses, including absorption and emission spectroscopy, along with quantum yield measurements, demonstrate efficient energy transfer from the attached fluorophores to the BDHP core, leading to an enhanced BDHP&#8594;BCPD isomerization process. This energy transfer mechanism significantly enhances the photoisomerization efficiency, resulting in more than a twofold increase in the ring&#8208;opening quantum yield compared to the nonfunctionalized BDHP controls. Additionally, the efficiency of photoisomerization of the coumarin&#8208;substituted derivative was extended in the switching studies in embedded solid polymeric matrices with efficient reversible photoisomerization, photostability over multiple switching cycles, and an all&#8208;optical logic gate. These findings demonstrate a promising strategy to improve the performance of the BDHP photochromic systems and their potential applications in molecular logic devices in thin film.

         <title>Coal&#8208;Derived Carbon Support Regulates Interfacial Water Molecules toward Enhanced Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution on Platinum Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Increasing interfacial free H2O accelerates the alkaline HER, yet simple and effective methods remain scarce. This work shows that carbonyl and carboxyl groups on carbon supports greatly increase the ratio of free H2O via forming local hydrogen bondings. Consequently, a functional support derived from bituminous coal renders Pt with high activity and stability.








Abstract
Carbon&#8208;supported platinum (Pt) nanoparticles (NPs) are efficient electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) but suffer from suboptimal kinetics in alkaline media. While restructuring interfacial water molecules offers a promising route to enhance alkaline HER, simple and effective strategies remain scarce. Here, we prepared Pt NPs on different carbon supports with varied compositions of oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups (OFGs) and explored the correlation between the HER activity and the OFG composition. Structural analyses confirm negligible effects of the support on the morphology, size, or electronic states of Pt NPs. However, in situ Raman spectroscopy reveals that OFGs, including carbonyl (C&#160;=&#160;O) and carboxyl (COOH) groups increase the proportion of interfacial free water molecules by reorganizing local hydrogen bonding. Meanwhile, a bituminous coal&#8208;derived carbon (bitu@C), featuring abundant OFGs, was developed as a functional support for Pt NPs. The Pt/bitu@C catalyst achieves a mass activity of 1.33 A mgpt&#8722;1 at an overpotential of 100&#160;mV, significantly outperforming commercial carbon&#8208;supported counterparts, while exhibiting enhanced stability. This work highlights the critical role of OFGs in modulating water structures and provides a practical, coal&#8208;derived platform for engineering interfacial water molecules toward efficient alkaline HER kinetics.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbon-supported platinum (Pt) nanoparticles (NPs) are efficient electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) but suffer from suboptimal kinetics in alkaline media. While restructuring interfacial water molecules offers a promising route to enhance alkaline HER, simple and effective strategies remain scarce. Here, we prepared Pt NPs on different carbon supports with varied compositions of oxygen-containing functional groups (OFGs) and explored the correlation between the HER activity and the OFG composition. Structural analyses confirm negligible effects of the support on the morphology, size, or electronic states of Pt NPs. However, in situ Raman spectroscopy reveals that OFGs, including carbonyl (C&#160;=&#160;O) and carboxyl (COOH) groups increase the proportion of interfacial free water molecules by reorganizing local hydrogen bonding. Meanwhile, a bituminous coal-derived carbon (bitu@C), featuring abundant OFGs, was developed as a functional support for Pt NPs. The Pt/bitu@C catalyst achieves a mass activity of 1.33 A mg&lt;sub&gt;pt&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at an overpotential of 100&#160;mV, significantly outperforming commercial carbon-supported counterparts, while exhibiting enhanced stability. This work highlights the critical role of OFGs in modulating water structures and provides a practical, coal-derived platform for engineering interfacial water molecules toward efficient alkaline HER kinetics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoinduced Electron Transfer (PET) as Key to Accelerate the Cycloreversion Reaction of Arylquadricyclanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is demonstrated that the photoinduced cycloreversion of a methoxynaphthylquadricyclane in the presence of suitable photocatalysts gives quantitatively the corresponding norbornadiene. As this photochromic norbornadiene&#8208;quadricyclane cycle has favorable properties for light energy conversion, this method provides a useful tool for the targeted release of stored energy with high temporal and local control.








Abstract
The development of methods for the utilization of sustainable energy resources is an important scientific challenge. In one approach, the conversion and storage of solar light energy as chemical energy in a photoreaction has been established, namely as molecular solar thermal energy storage (MOST). In particular, the norbornadiene&#8208;quadricyclane system offers favorable photochemical and physicochemical properties for this purpose. However, the chemical reaction to release the stored energy, i.e., the cycloreversion of the quadricyclane, still requires improvement. In this context, we demonstrate that a fast and controlled cycloreversion of 2&#8208;(5&#8208;(1&#8208;methoxynaphthyl))quadricyclane can be accomplished in a photoinduced electron transfer (PET) reaction. Specifically, we identified 9&#8208;mesityl&#8208;10&#8208;methylacridinium, 9,10&#8208;dicyanoanthracene, and 9&#8208;nitrobenzo[b]quinolizinium as suitable catalysts that initiate the fast cycloreversion of the quadricyclane to the norbornadiene with visible light (420&#160;nm) and with low catalyst loading. At the same time, there is no significant loss of favorable MOST properties, namely half&#8208;life and energy storage density. Thus, this method provides an efficient, complementary tool for the targeted cycloreversion of quadricyclane with high temporal and local control, as required for MOST applications.

         <title>Dipolar Molecular Motor Candidates with Planar Chirality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two prototypes of molecular motors with simultaneous implementation of planar chirality and a permanent dipole have been designed and synthesized in 7 steps with overall yields of 2.8 to 5.5%.








Abstract
Two molecular motor candidates built around ruthenium(II) centers featuring both planar chirality and a permanent dipole have been synthesized in seven steps. These motors incorporate desymmetrized cyclopentadienyl ligands bearing electron&#8208;donating (4&#8208;methoxyphenyl) and electron&#8208;withdrawing (3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl) groups in 1,2 or 1,3 relative positions, to induce strong dipolar moments and asymmetry helpful for unidirectional rotation. Two dipolar pentaarylcyclopentadienyl ligands were synthesized and coordinated to a Ru(II) trisindazolylborate complex functionalized with thioether moieties for surface anchoring. Structural analysis and DFT calculations revealed that dipole moments increase upon complexation, reaching 5.60 D and 4.58 D for the 1,2&#8208;CpAr5[Ru]Tp and 1,3&#8208;CpAr5[Ru]Tp complexes, respectively. Key synthetic challenges, such as low yields in Knoevenagel condensations and side reactions, were addressed through careful modulation of precursors, reaction conditions and cation selection. This study demonstrates the feasibility of integrating permanent dipoles and chirality into molecular motor design, which could offer an enhanced control over motion under STM&#8208;induced electric fields.

         <title>Versatile Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8208;H Arylation of Fluoroarenes with 2&#8208;Chloropyridine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct C&#9472;H arylation of fluoroarenes with 2&#8208;chloropyridines is enabled by a simple Pd/SPhos system in isopropyl acetate. The method uses inexpensive reactants and shows broad scope and high yields. DFT computations explain reactivity and selectivity. This practical strategy provides general access to fluorinated heteroarenes relevant across pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials science.








Abstract
Direct C&#9472;H arylation of fluoroarenes with 2&#8208;halopyridines remains underexplored, due to the low reactivity of both partners and the reliance on harsh conditions or toxic solvents. Herein, we report a general and sustainable method for the C&#9472;H arylation of fluoroarenes with 2&#8208;chloropyridines using Pd/SPhos as a simple catalytic system in isopropyl acetate. The protocol employs inexpensive starting materials, shows broad functional group tolerance, and delivers a wide range of 2&#8208;(fluorinated aryl)pyridines in up to 90% yield. Substrate scope studies uncovered key substituent effects on both coupling partners, while Density Functional Theory (DFT)&#8208;supported mechanistic analysis rationalized the observed reactivity and chemoselectivity. This research advances sustainable and practical methodologies for the synthesis of complex fluorinated aromatic compounds with potential applications in materials science, agrochemistry, and medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Enhanced Solid&#8208;State Luminescence of Supramolecular Tessellation Assemblies Through F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer From Counterions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work explores how supramolecular tessellation enhances fluorescence quantum yield and induces redshift. Through self&#8208;assembly, it suppresses intramolecular rotation and vibration (RIR) that reduce nonradiative decay, boosting efficiency and shifting emission.








Abstract
The development of straightforward strategies for constructing supramolecular tessellations with enhanced solid&#8208;state luminescence has attracted growing interest in supramolecular chemistry and luminescent materials. Herein, we report the formation of diverse supramolecular tiling patterns by combining electron&#8208;deficient bipyridinium&#8208;based cationic macrocycles with either naphthalene&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonate or naphthalene&#8208;2&#8208;sulfonate counterions directly. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals distinct tessellated superstructures assembled from 3,3&#8242;&#8208;bipyridinium macrocycles, stabilized by a network of electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; stacking, and CH&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions. These assemblies exhibit red&#8208;shifted and enhanced solid&#8208;state fluorescence, attributed to F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the macrocycles and their aromatic counterions. Crystallographic and computational studies provide molecular&#8208;level insights into the noncovalent forces governing both the assembly process and luminescence enhancement. This work establishes a facile design strategy for constructing luminescent supramolecular tessellations and offers a deeper understanding of their structure&#8211;property relationships.

         <title>Hole&#8208;Selective Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers Overlaid on NiOx or PEDOT:PSS for Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells &#8211; An Overview of Recent Characterization Methods</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Successfully applying self&#8208;assembled monolayers with hole&#8208;selectivity for lead&#8208;free tin perovskite solar cells requires judicious investigation with appropriately powerful characterization methods, in addition to efforts in the development of new materials and processing. We herein review the diverse characterization methods, the results obtained through them, and how to interpret those results.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) with high hole&#8208;selectivity have seen growing use in the research realm of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Even though SAMs can be used solely, their hole&#8208;selective performance is amplifiable on a p&#8208;type underlayer such as nickel oxide (NiOx) or poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS). This is especially prominent in lead&#8208;free tin&#8208;based PSCs. Herein, we review recent relevant publications on hole&#8208;selective SAMs overlaid on NiOx or PEDOT:PSS for tin PSCs. We first examine the characteristic features of the SAMs introduced in each publication. Since SAMs can affect the surface properties, interfacial properties, and perovskite quality, we focus on how these aspects are characterized and which methods are employed. In particular, the employed methods are various spanning computational simulations, microscopy imaging and electrochemical, spectroscopic, and crystallographic measurements.

     alt="Hole-Selective Self-Assembled Monolayers Overlaid on NiOx or PEDOT:PSS for Tin-Based Perovskite Solar Cells &#8211; An Overview of Recent Characterization Methods"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successfully applying self-assembled monolayers with hole-selectivity for lead-free tin perovskite solar cells requires judicious investigation with appropriately powerful characterization methods, in addition to efforts in the development of new materials and processing. We herein review the diverse characterization methods, the results obtained through them, and how to interpret those results.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) with high hole-selectivity have seen growing use in the research realm of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Even though SAMs can be used solely, their hole-selective performance is amplifiable on a p-type underlayer such as nickel oxide (NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;) or poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS). This is especially prominent in lead-free tin-based PSCs. Herein, we review recent relevant publications on hole-selective SAMs overlaid on NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; or PEDOT:PSS for tin PSCs. We first examine the characteristic features of the SAMs introduced in each publication. Since SAMs can affect the surface properties, interfacial properties, and perovskite quality, we focus on how these aspects are characterized and which methods are employed. In particular, the employed methods are various spanning computational simulations, microscopy imaging and electrochemical, spectroscopic, and crystallographic measurements. Through this review, we aim to encourage researchers to explore these aspects and methodologies in future research on hole-selective SAMs for tin PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Decoupling Redox Potentials and Excited State Energies in Substituted Chromium(III) Chromophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox and excited state properties of organic and precious metal CT photocatalysts are strongly entangled. In contrast, redox potentials of polypyridine chromium(III) complexes, that feature purely metal&#8208;centered SF states, are selectively tuned by incremental substituent effects of the CF3 group, while excited state energies and lifetimes remain unaffected. Such precisely designed chromophores provide a unique tool for the systematic investigation of elementary reaction steps relevant to photoredox catalytic cycles.








Abstract
Redox and excited state properties of classical organic and precious metal charge&#8208;transfer (CT) photocatalysts can be tuned by substituent effects&#8212;however, not independently, as redox and chromophore units are strongly entangled. In contrast, substituent effects should selectively address electrochemical properties of photoactive complexes based on metal&#8208;centered spin&#8208;flip (SF) excited states lacking CT character without compromising excited state properties. Yet, detailed structure&#8208;activity relationships for SF chromophores are lacking. We demonstrate that the redox potentials of polypyridine chromium(III) complexes, that feature purely metal&#8208;centered SF states, can be selectively tuned by incremental substituent effects, while the excited state energies and lifetimes remain unaffected. This delivers a unique series of chromophores with identical optical properties, but redox potentials tuned by increments. We believe, that such precisely designed chromophore series provide a unique tool for the systematic investigation of photoredox reactions and recombination processes relevant to photoredox catalytic cycles.

         <title>(2&#8208;Phosphinophenyl)aluminum Dichloride Complexes as Intramolecular Al/P Frustrated Lewis Pairs for Ketone, Ester, and Imine Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three 2&#8208;phosphinophenylaluminum dichloride complexes were synthesized and characterized as novel intramolecular FLPs. These FLP systems exhibit high Lewis acidity and effectively activate challenging substrates including aliphatic ketones, imines, and esters. DFT analysis revealed that strain release and Al&#8211;P dynamics govern their reactivity.








Abstract
(2&#8208;Phosphinophenyl)aluminum dichloride complexes were synthesized and their frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) reactivity was investigated. Selective mono&#8208;substitution of AlCl3 with lithioarenes was achieved by introducing sterically demanding substituents&#8212;tert&#8208;butyl, ethyl, or PCy2&#8212;at the 6&#8208;position of the phenylene linker, effectively suppressing over&#8208;substitution and enabling successful isolation of the target complexes. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopic analyses confirmed the formation of a four&#8208;membered P&#8211;Al&#8211;C&#8211;C core structure. These complexes function as Al/P&#8208;based FLPs capable of activating simple carbonyl and imine compounds, including aliphatic ketones, prop&#8208;2&#8208;ynoate esters, and N&#8208;arylimines. The mechanism of carbonyl activation by these Al/P FLPs was elucidated through density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Synthesis of Cyclobutane&#8208;Containing Tricyclic &#946;&#8208;Lactams Based on a Saturated Scaffold Enabled by Iron&#8208;catalysed [2&#160;+&#160;2]&#8208;Cycloaddition</title>

First syntheses of pyrrolidine&#8208;, piperidine&#8208;, and azepane tricyclic &#946;&#8208;lactams based on a saturated scaffold are achieved through an Fe&#8208;pyrimidinediimine&#8208;catalysed [2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition of allylamines analogues followed by photo&#8208;induced intramolecular C&#9472;H insertion. The cage&#8208;like &#946;&#8208;lactam scaffolds enable strain&#8208;release access to methylphenidate analogues and expand the three&#8208;dimensional chemical space.








Abstract
Highly saturated, three&#8208;dimensional &#946;&#8208;lactams are valuable motifs in medicinal chemistry, yet general routes to cyclobutane&#8208;fused analogues remain scarce. Here we disclose a concise strategy that delivers pyrrolidine&#8208;, piperidine&#8208;, and azepane&#8208;based tricyclic &#946;&#8208;lactams. A pyrimidinediimine&#8208;iron catalyst first constructs the cyclobutane ring and the N&#8208;heterocycle in one step through an intermolecular [2&#160;+&#160;2]&#8208;cycloaddition of allyl amines; a subsequent photochemical intramolecular C&#9472;H insertion then forges the &#946;&#8208;lactam. The major products adopt rigid, cage&#8208;like conformations confirmed for the pyrrolidine series by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Comprehensive conformer sampling (using CREST), DFT&#8208;calculated NMR shifts, and DP4 statistical analysis establish the stereochemistry across the library. Strain&#8208;release opening of the &#946;&#8208;lactam ring furnishes methylphenidate analogues in a single step, underscoring the scaffolds&#8217; synthetic versatility. Comparative studies on the corresponding bicyclic systems highlight the unique three&#8208;dimensionality imparted by the additional cyclobutane ring, further expanding the toolbox for lead&#8208;oriented synthesis.

         <title>Stereoselective Syntheses of Cyclic Microsclerodermin Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Six different cyclic microsclerodermin derivatives are obtained from l&#8208;xylose and d&#8208;arabinose via stereoselective Sakurai allylations and photochemical Arndt&#8208;Eistert homologations.








Abstract
Starting from l&#8208;xylose and d&#8208;arabinose, six different cyclic microscleroderma derivatives were successfully obtained. Key steps of the syntheses are, on the one hand, Sakurai allylations, whose stereochemical course depends on the Lewis acid used, and on the other hand, photochemical Wolff rearrangements in the presence of complex aminofuranosides. Finally, aromatic side chains were introduced via cross metathesis.

         <title>The N&#8208;Bromo&#8208;Hammick Intermediate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spectroscopic and computational analysis uncovers the &#963;2&#963;*0 electronic structure of the N&#8208;bromo&#8208;Hammick intermediate, a singlet N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene isolated in solid neon, whose back&#8208;isomerization to bromopyridine proceeds via a planar transition state.








Abstract
We report the characterization of bromopyridin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene, the N&#8208;bromo&#8208;Hammick intermediate, isolated in solid neon at 4.4&#160;K. Computations (B2PLYP, NEVPT2), IR, and UV/vis spectroscopy characterize this intermediate as a singlet carbene with a vacant &#963;*&#8208;type frontier orbital. This unusual electronic structure (&#963;2&#963;*0) allows the carbene to isomerize to its more stable pyridine tautomer via a planar transition state, avoiding the deviation from planarity seen in other singlet carbenes. The compound's reaction with molecular hydrogen faces a minor but prohibitive barrier (8.4&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1) at the low temperatures of the experiment.

&lt;p&gt;We report the characterization of bromopyridin-2-ylidene, the N-bromo-Hammick intermediate, isolated in solid neon at 4.4&#160;K. Computations (B2PLYP, NEVPT2), IR, and UV/vis spectroscopy characterize this intermediate as a singlet carbene with a vacant &#963;*-type frontier orbital. This unusual electronic structure (&#963;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#963;*&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;) allows the carbene to isomerize to its more stable pyridine tautomer &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; a planar transition state, avoiding the deviation from planarity seen in other singlet carbenes. The compound's reaction with molecular hydrogen faces a minor but prohibitive barrier (8.4&#160;kcal mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) at the low temperatures of the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrogen Bond Reformation in Tetracarboxylic Acid&#8208;Based Organic Frameworks with Square Lattice Topology</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural transformation in hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) via bond cleavage and reformation is highlighted. Sql&#8208;type HOFs composed of tetracarboxylic acids bearing 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxy&#8208;o&#8208;terphenyl moieties are shown to be particularly prone to H&#8208;bond reformations. Analysis of molecular conformation and crystal packing provides design insights for controlling H&#8208;bond reformation, guiding the development of dynamic porous materials.








Abstract
The weak and reversible nature of hydrogen bonds endows porous materials with structural flexibility. In this article, we highlight structural transformations involving the cleavage and reformation of hydrogen bonds&#8212;termed H&#8208;bond reformation. To enable control over H&#8208;bond reformation through molecular design, we examine and discuss key structural features. Particular attention is given to tetracarboxylic acids bearing 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxy&#8208;o&#8208;terphenyl moieties as scaffolds for inducing H&#8208;bond reformation. These insights are expected to guide the rational design of dynamic porous materials with tunable properties and stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior.

         <title>Coordination Chemistry of Phosphinidene Stabilized by Mesoionic N&#8208;heterocyclic Carbene and Catalysis</title>

Abstract
Abnormal N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;stabilized phosphinidene, a class of low&#8208;valent phosphorus compounds, has been recently stabilized by an isolated abnormal NHC. However, its coordination chemistry with various metal ions remained unexplored. Herein, we have explored the coordination chemistry of a mesoionic N&#8208;heterocyclic phosphinidene (mNHP,1), stabilized by an abnormal N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (aNHC) with various metals (Cu, Zn, and Sn) to afford trimetallic, bimetallic, and monometallic complexes, respectively. All these complexes were characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. We have also explored the catalytic activity of one of these complexes for alkynylation of trifluoromethyl ketones and found that mNHP (1)&#8208;bound trimetallic Cu&#8208;complex is an excellent catalyst for this reaction with up to 97% isolated yield under low catalyst loading (3 mol%).

         <dc:description>
NMR evidence shows that tin(IV) chloride complexes with N,N&#8217;&#8208;bidentate sulfur diimide (SDI) ligands exist in a concentration&#8208;dependent equilibrium with acetonitrile, favoring displacement of SDI in dilute solutions. Voltammetry of only the bis&#8208;acetonitrile adduct shows deposition of tin(0) metal upon reduction, which seems to be suppressed in the presence of SDI, suggesting that SDIs may operate as redox&#8208;active ligands.








Abstract
A series of Sn(IV) chloride complexes with sulfur diimide (SDI, R&#8208;NSN&#8208;R) ligands are presented, including structural characterization of first&#8208;in&#8208;class complexes of bidentate diaryl&#8208;SDIs, [SnCl4{&#954;2&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;S(NAr)2}] (Ar&#160;=&#160;4&#8208;X&#8208;C6H4&#8208;), and an oxygen&#8208;coordinated sulfinylamine, [SnCl4{&#954;1&#8208;O&#8208;OSNPh}2]. As part of the comprehensive experimental and DFT computational investigation, 119Sn NMR analysis revealed a dynamic exchange equilibrium in acetonitrile between SDI ligands and solvent, providing insight into their complicated solution&#8208;state chemical and electrochemical behavior. Voltammetric experiments show that, despite this dynamic equilibrium, the SDI ligands appear to suppress typical Sn(IV) reduction pathways. While tentative due to the complex behavior, this suggests that SDIs are functioning as redox&#8208;active (RA) ligands. In conjunction with our previous systematic characterization of diaryl&#8208;SDIs, these findings highlight their potential as an easily derivatized and highly redox&#8208;tunable category of RA ligand and emphatically warrant further investigation.

         <title>Pomegranate&#8211;Like Nano&#8208;Confined Silicon Inside Conductive Carbon Black as Anode Materials for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

We report a new strategy to prepare a pomegranate&#8208;like nano&#8208;confined silicon&#8208;carbon composites with excellent performance through a combination of wet chemical reduction methods and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique. The Si/XC@C&#8208;0.2 electrode exhibited a capacity retention rate of 157.7% after 400 cycles at a current density of 1 A g&#8722;1, while the Si/XC@C&#8208;0.5 electrode achieved the highest capacity after 400 cycles, reaching 835&#160;mA h g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Si materials possess a high theoretical specific capacity when used as anode material in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Si/C composites mitigate volume expansion and enhance conductivity, thus achieving improved electrochemical performance in LIBs. Herein, we report a new strategy for preparing pomegranate&#8208;like Si/C nanocomposites based on low&#8208;cost, readily available conductive carbon black (XC) by using a combination of wet chemical reduction and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques. The preparation first involves a facile wet chemical approach to controlled hydrolysis of SiCl4 within XC. Subsequently, the obtained SiO2/XC precursor is reduced to highly crystalline Si particles within XC (Si/XC) using a novel ionic liquid&#8208;magnesium reduction system, avoiding unwanted byproducts associated with conventional high&#8208;temperature magnesium reduction. Finally, a pomegranate&#8208;like Si/XC composite is coated with an outer carbon layer via CVD, forming a nano&#8208;confined Si/C structure. The composites exhibit excellent reversible capacity and good cycle stability in LIBs. At 1 A g&#8722;1 after 400 cycles, the Si/XC@C&#8208;0.5 composite delivered the highest specific capacity of 835&#160;mA h g&#8722;1, exhibiting a capacity retention rate of 121% compared to the first cycle after activation (688&#160;mA h g&#8722;1). This work provides reproducible and scalable means to prepare high&#8208;performance Si/C composites for LIBs.

         <title>Synthesis of Fully Exposed Pt Nanoparticles on a 2D Mesoporous Graphitic Nanocarbon Framework for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a novel 2D mesoporous graphitic nanocarbon framework (MGF) is synthesized through chemical etching of 2D Fe3O4 nanocube superlattices (Fe3O4 NCSLs) and subsequent high&#8208;temperature graphitization. MGF possesses large specific surface area, open porous architecture, and high graphitization degree, making it an excellent platform for constructing Pt&#8208;based ORR electrocatalysts. The resulting Pt@MGF catalyst&#160;exhibits superior ORR activity and durability over commercial Pt/C catalysts.








Abstract
The durability of proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells is often compromised by the corrosion of carbon supports in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) cathodes under harsh operating conditions, including high oxygen concentration, elevated humidity, low pH, and high potentials. To overcome this limitation, we report the synthesis of a 2D mesoporous graphitic nanocarbon framework (MGF) via chemical etching and high&#8208;temperature graphitization. The resulting MGF features a monolayer, highly ordered nanoframe architecture that offers enhanced structural stability and conductivity. Leveraging these structural advantages, we designed fully exposed Pt nanoparticles anchored on the MGF (Pt@MGF) as a model system to investigate the interplay between graphitization degree, pore architecture, and electrocatalytic performance. Among the variants, Pt@MGF&#8208;1200, synthesized at 1200&#160;&#176;C, demonstrates optimized mesopore confinement and strong Pt&#8211;carbon interactions.

     alt="Synthesis of Fully Exposed Pt Nanoparticles on a 2D Mesoporous Graphitic Nanocarbon Framework for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, a novel 2D mesoporous graphitic nanocarbon framework (MGF) is synthesized through chemical etching of 2D Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanocube superlattices (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; NCSLs) and subsequent high-temperature graphitization. MGF possesses large specific surface area, open porous architecture, and high graphitization degree, making it an excellent platform for constructing Pt-based ORR electrocatalysts. The resulting Pt@MGF catalyst&#160;exhibits superior ORR activity and durability over commercial Pt/C catalysts.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The durability of proton-exchange membrane fuel cells is often compromised by the corrosion of carbon supports in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) cathodes under harsh operating conditions, including high oxygen concentration, elevated humidity, low pH, and high potentials. To overcome this limitation, we report the synthesis of a 2D mesoporous graphitic nanocarbon framework (MGF) via chemical etching and high-temperature graphitization. The resulting MGF features a monolayer, highly ordered nanoframe architecture that offers enhanced structural stability and conductivity. Leveraging these structural advantages, we designed fully exposed Pt nanoparticles anchored on the MGF (Pt@MGF) as a model system to investigate the interplay between graphitization degree, pore architecture, and electrocatalytic performance. Among the variants, Pt@MGF-1200, synthesized at 1200&#160;&#176;C, demonstrates optimized mesopore confinement and strong Pt&#8211;carbon interactions. This results in superior electrochemical durability and ORR activity, positioning Pt@MGF-1200 as a promising alternative to conventional Pt/C catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Products of the Phenyl Radical (C6H5, X2A1) &#8211; Acetylene (C2H2, X1&#931;g+) Reaction in the 800&#8208;1,200&#160;K Temperature Range</title>

A pulsed high&#8208;temperature microreactor coupled with VUV PI Re&#8208;TOF&#8208;MS was used to study the C6H5&#160;+&#160;C2H2 reaction via the HACA mechanism. Key products (C4H4, C6H5, C6H5C2H, C10H8, etc.) were detected in a molecular beam. At 800&#8211;1200&#160;K and 100&#8211;600&#160;Torr, the main products were phenylacetylene (C6H5C2H) and naphthalene (C10H8), supporting HACA dominance. Temperature and pressure trends align with theoretical predictions.








Abstract
A pulsed flow high&#8208;temperature microreactor in tandem with vacuum ultraviolet photoionization (VUV PI) reflectron time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometry (Re&#8208;TOF&#8208;MS) was employed to determine branching ratios of key product channels of the reaction of the phenyl radical (C6H5) with acetylene (C2H2) highlighting the role of the Hydrogen Abstraction &#8211; C2H2 Addition (HACA) mechanism at temperatures of 800&#8211;1,200&#160;K. Temporal profiles of m/z&#160;=&#160;26 (C2H2+), 30 (NO+), 52 (C4H4+), 77 (C6H5+), 78 (C6H6+), 102 (C6H5C2H+), 103 (C6H5C2H2+), 107 (C6H5NO+), 128 (C10H8+), and 154 (C12H10+) were recorded and characterized within a molecular beam. From the time profiles of the ion signals and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) calculations in the transient mode, zones of the molecular beam corresponding to the open valve duration time were identified. The gas velocity along the microreactor tube axis with the opened valve is strongly influenced by the backing pressure (p) in front of the nozzle and appears to be subsonic for p = 100&#160;Torr and supersonic for p &#8805; 300&#160;Torr. The main quantified finding is that phenylacetylene (C6H5C2H) constitutes the dominant product, accounting for up to 91% of consumed phenyl radicals at 1,200&#160;K, whereas naphthalene (C10H8) formation is favored at lower temperatures and higher pressures, peaking at the yield of 53% (800&#160;K, 300&#160;Torr). The observed temperature and pressure dependence of naphthalene and phenylacetylene yields are consistent with the HACA mechanism.

         <title>Tautomerism&#8208;Coupled Self&#8208;Assembly and Transformations of Iminopyrrole Metallacages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four metallacages with varying size, symmetry, and nuclearity were formed via the self&#8208;assembly of 2,5&#8208;diformylpyrrole, tren, and zinc(II) acetate. Tautomerization of the key diiminopyrrole motif to iminoaminoazafulvene altered the assemblies&#8217; properties. Stimuli&#8208;induced, partially reversible interconversions between bi&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, and dodecanuclear cages revealed their dynamic nature.








Abstract
Four discrete metallacages were obtained from the condensation of 2,5&#8208;diformylpyrrole and tren in the presence of Zn(II). The structures differed in nuclearity, size, and symmetry, with the number of templating cations playing a key role in defining the properties of the architecture. The diiminopyrrole coordination motif, a fundamental structural feature of assemblies, undergoes tautomerization in certain cases, yielding an iminoaminoazafulvene, which alters the assembly. The controlled interconversion between bi&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, and dodecanuclear cages was achieved through simple stimuli, highlighting the dynamic nature of these assemblies.

         <title>Terminal Selective Arylation of Inert Alkanes via Radical&#8208;Organometallic Crossover</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selectivity is an essential part of organic synthesis and key to synthetic efficiency. However, selectivity is challenging to achieve in hydrocarbon molecules. Herein we report a mild and direct method that combines photo&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (photo&#8208;HAT) and nickel&#8208;catalyzed organometallic chainwalking chemistry to give the first highly linear selective arylation reaction starting from inert alkanes.








Abstract
Selectivity is an essential part of organic synthesis and key to synthetic efficiency, where it can help reduce energy requirements for product separation, purification, and disposal of low value by&#8208;products. However, selectivity is challenging to achieve in hydrocarbon molecules, with C&#9472;H functionalization of alkanes almost invariably leading to a complex mixture of products favoring branched isomers and linear selectivity remaining elusive. Herein we report a mild and direct method that combines photo&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (photo&#8208;HAT) and nickel catalyzed organometallic chainwalking chemistry to give the first highly linear selective arylation reaction starting from inert alkanes. Key to success is crossover from a radical to organometallic chainwalking mechanism permitted by a monodentate lutidine ligand, allowing an unselective photo&#8208;HAT step to be funneled regioconvergently to form the linear arylation product for a variety of alkanes. This result is in sharp contrast to the unselective formation of branched products using bidentate ligands and demonstrates monodentate heterocycles to be a privileged ligand class for selective C&#9472;H functionalization. Preliminary mechanistic experiments are consistent with the radical&#8208;organometallic crossover mechanism and support it as an important step toward controllable and selective functionalization of simple hydrocarbons.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent advances in HOF membranes for gas separation. In addition to covering fabrication methods of HOF membranes, this review highlights key characteristics that determine separation performance. Progress in challenging gas separations is deeply discussed, followed by an analysis of current limitations and future research directions for next&#8208;generation membrane development.








Abstract
The development of efficient and sustainable gas separation technologies is crucial for addressing global challenges in energy and the environment. Membrane separation technology, as an innovative, energy&#8208;saving, and highly efficient approach, offers an effective solution to these challenges. High&#8208;performance membranes materials serve as the core component enabling advanced and efficient membrane separation. Notably, hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) represent an emerging class of crystalline porous membrane materials formed through intermolecular hydrogen bonds between organic or metal&#8208;organic building units. The unique advantages of these materials, including moderate synthesis conditions, high crystallinity, and easy repairability and renewability, make them ideal porous membrane materials. This review comprehensively examines recent advances in HOF gas separation membranes. We objectively outline fabrication approaches and material design principle, including development prospects and preparation techniques for HOF separation membranes. We then systematically evaluate the current application status of HOF membranes in gas separation. Finally, future application potentials are projected, and challenges to be addressed in HOF gas separation are discussed.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of efficient and sustainable gas separation technologies is crucial for addressing global challenges in energy and the environment. Membrane separation technology, as an innovative, energy-saving, and highly efficient approach, offers an effective solution to these challenges. High-performance membranes materials serve as the core component enabling advanced and efficient membrane separation. Notably, hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) represent an emerging class of crystalline porous membrane materials formed through intermolecular hydrogen bonds between organic or metal-organic building units. The unique advantages of these materials, including moderate synthesis conditions, high crystallinity, and easy repairability and renewability, make them ideal porous membrane materials. This review comprehensively examines recent advances in HOF gas separation membranes. We objectively outline fabrication approaches and material design principle, including development prospects and preparation techniques for HOF separation membranes. We then systematically evaluate the current application status of HOF membranes in gas separation. Finally, future application potentials are projected, and challenges to be addressed in HOF gas separation are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
