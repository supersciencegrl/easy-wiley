         <title>Integrated Reversible Thermochromism, High Tc, Dielectric Switch and Narrow Band Gap in One Multifunctional Ferroic</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rarely reported multi&#8208;functional ferroelastic shows a high phase transition temperature of 427.7&#8197;K. The coexistence of ferroelastic, narrow band gap, thermochromic, and dielectric properties makes it potentially promising for use in multifunctional smart devices such as nature&#8208;bionic, energy conversion, signal storage and encryption, and switching.







Abstract
Organic&#8208;inorganic Hybrid (OIH) materials for multifunctional switchable applications have attracted enormous attention in recent years due to their excellent optoelectronic properties and good structural tunability. However, it still remains challenging to fabricate one simple OIH compound with multi&#8208;functionals properties, such as dielectric switching, thermochromic properties, semiconductor characteristics and ferroelasticity. Under this context, we successfully synthesized [2&#8208;(2&#8208;fluorophenyl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208; ammonium]2SnBr6 (compound 1), which has a higher phase transition temperature of 427.7&#8197;K. Additionally, it exhibits a semiconducting property with an indirect band gap of 2.36&#8197;eV. Combining ferroelastic, narrow band gap, thermochromic, and dielectric properties, compound 1 can be considered as a rarely reported multi&#8208;functional ferroelastic material, which is expected to give inspiration for broadening the applications in the smart devices field.

         <title>Mechanistic Aspects on [3+2] Cycloaddition (32CA) Reactions of Azides to Nitroolefins: A Computational and Kinetic Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detailed mechanistic study of [3+2] cycloadditions between nitroolefins and azides is described. Combining DFT calculations, kinetic studies, and activation strain analysis, our studies shed new mechanistic insight on the factors controlling reactivity and regioselectivity in this transformation and highlight the role of non&#8208;statistical effects in organocatalyzed and metal&#8208;free dipolar cycloadditions.







Abstract
[3+2] cycloadditions of nitroolefins have emerged as a selective and catalyst&#8208;free alternative for the synthesis of 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles from azides. We describe mechanistic studies into the cycloaddition/rearomatization reaction sequence. DFT calculations revealed a rate&#8208;limiting cycloaddition step proceeding via an asynchronous TS with high kinetic selectivity for the 1,5&#8208;triazole. Kinetic studies reveal a second&#8208;order rate law, and 13C kinetic isotopic effects at natural abundance were measured with a significant normal effect at the conjugated olefinic centers of 1.0158 and 1.0216 at the &#945; and &#946;&#8208;carbons of &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene. Distortion/interaction&#8208;activation strain and energy decomposition analyses revealed that the major regioisomeric pathway benefits from an earlier and less&#8208;distorted TS, while intermolecular interaction terms dominate the preference for 1,5&#8208; over 1,4&#8208;cycloadducts. In addition, the major regioisomer also has more favorable electrostatic and dispersion terms. Additionally, while static DFT calculations suggest a concerted but highly asynchronous Ei&#8208;type HNO2 elimination mechanism, quasiclassical direct&#8208;dynamics calculations reveal the existence of a dynamic intermediate.

         <title>Correct Identification of the Core&#8208;Shell Structure of Cell Membrane&#8208;Coated Polymeric Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The core&#8208;shell structure of cell membrane&#8208;coated PLGA NPs (poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid nanoparticles) observed in some negatively stained transmission electron microscopy (TEM) samples is an artifact caused by the staining of the original PLGA NPs and not due to the actual cell membrane coating.







Abstract
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations of negatively stained cell membrane (CM)&#8208;coated polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) reveal a characteristic core&#8208;shell structure. However, negative staining agents can create artifacts that complicate the determination of the actual NP structure. Herein, it is demonstrated with various bare polymeric core NPs, such as poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) (PLGA), poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether&#8208;block&#8208;PLGA, and poly(caprolactone), that certain observed core&#8208;shell structures are actually artifacts caused by the staining process. To address this issue, fluorescence quenching was applied to quantify the proportion of fully coated NPs and statistical TEM analysis was used to identify and differentiate whether the observed core&#8208;shell structures of CM&#8208;coated PLGA (CM&#8722;PLGA) NPs are due to artifacts or to the CM coating. Integrated shells in TEM images of negatively stained CM&#8722;PLGA NPs are identified as artifacts. The present results challenge current understanding of the structure of CM&#8208;coated polymeric NPs and encourage researchers to use the proposed characterization approach to avoid misinterpretations.

         <title>Electro&#8208;assisted Molecular Assembly Giving Atomic&#8208;Scale Catalytic Active&#8208;Site Detection</title>

Pinpoint: This work proposes a novel electro&#8208;assisted molecular assembly strategy to obtain a carbon defect with a target structure. More specifically, it identified that the topmost carbon atom on a pentagon carbon defect is the active site for the oxygen reduction reaction from the experimental perspective.







Abstract
The artificially accurate design of nonmetal electrocatalysts&#8217; active site has been a huge challenge because no pure active species with the specific structure could be strictly controlled by traditional synthetic methods. Species with a multiconfiguration in the catalyst hinder identification of the active site and the subsequent comprehension of the reaction mechanism. We have developed a novel electro&#8208;assisted molecular assembly strategy to obtain a pure pentagon ring on perfect graphene avoiding other reconstructed structures. More importantly, the active atom was confirmed by the subtle passivation process as the topmost carbon atom. Recognition of the carbon&#8208;defect electrocatalysis reaction mechanism was first downsized to the single&#8208;atom scale from the experimental perspective. It is expected that this innovative electro&#8208;assisted molecular assembly strategy could be extensively applied in the active structure&#8208;controlled synthesis of nonmetal electrocatalysts and verification of the exact active atom.

         <title>Non&#8208;Covalent Integration of a [FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenase Mimic to Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes for Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An original [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase mimic integrating two pyrene anchors was successfully synthesized and grafted at the surface of multiwalled carbon nanotube based electrodes. The hybrid molecular cathode could reach high turnover numbers for H2 production in fully aqueous media and sustain activity for 20&#8197;h.







Abstract
Surface integration of molecular catalysts inspired from the active sites of hydrogenase enzymes represents a promising route towards developing noble metal&#8208;free and sustainable technologies for H2 production. Efficient and stable catalyst anchoring is a key aspect to enable this approach. Herein, we report the preparation and electrochemical characterization of an original diironhexacarbonyl complex including two pyrene groups per catalytic unit in order to allow for its smooth integration, through &#960;&#8208;interactions, onto multiwalled carbon nanotube&#8208;based electrodes. In this configuration, the grafted catalyst could reach turnover numbers for H2 production (TONH2) of up to 4&#177;2&#215;103 within 20&#8197;h of bulk electrolysis, operating at neutral pH. Post operando analysis of catalyst functionalized electrodes revealed the degradation of the catalytic unit occurred via loss of the iron carbonyl units, while the anchoring groups and most part of the ligand remained attached onto multiwalled carbon nanotubes.

Herein, we report the preparation and electrochemical characterization of an original diironhexacarbonyl complex including two pyrene groups per catalytic unit in order to allow for its smooth integration, through &#960;-interactions, onto multiwalled carbon nanotube-based electrodes. In this configuration, the grafted catalyst could reach turnover numbers for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production (TON&lt;sub&gt;H2&lt;/sub&gt;) of up to 4&#177;2&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; within 20&#8197;h of bulk electrolysis, operating at neutral pH. &lt;i&gt;Post operando&lt;/i&gt; analysis of catalyst functionalized electrodes revealed the degradation of the catalytic unit occurred via loss of the iron carbonyl units, while the anchoring groups and most part of the ligand remained attached onto multiwalled carbon nanotubes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One&#8208;step Oxidative Monofluorination of Electron&#8208;Deficient Sulfoxides to Access Highly Lewis Acidic Sulfur(VI) Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly Lewis acidic fluorosulfoxonium cations can be prepared in a one&#8208;step, chloride promoter&#8208;free fashion from electron&#8208;deficient sulfoxides using [FXe][OTf]. The latter is prepared by reaction of XeF2 with TMS&#8208;OTf, thus representing an inversion of the previously described Umpolung strategy, which failed to convert the same sulfoxides efficiently. The Lewis acidities of the obtained cations have been probed experimentally and computationally.







Abstract
The strongly oxidizing, powerful electrophilic fluorination reagent [FXe][OTf] is shown to effect direct oxidative monofluorination of sulfoxides. This one&#8208;step, chloride promoter&#8208;free methodology provides access to so far inaccessible, yet highly desirable strongly Lewis acidic fluorosulfoxonium cations from electron&#8208;deficient and/or sterically demanding sulfoxides that are shown to be practically unreactive towards the previously reported XeF2/NEt4Cl system. Experimental and density functional theory studies have been conducted to assess the Lewis acidities of the prepared sulfur(VI) cations. Preliminary results obtained with chiral sulfoxides provide early insights into the mechanism of these fluorination reactions.

         <title>Trianionic 1,3,2&#8208;Dioxaborine&#8208;Containing Polymethines: Bright Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Very bright NIR polymethines bearing a trianionic chromophore comprising dioxaborine rings (A) and different electron&#8208;accepting end groups (A&#8242;) were synthesized and characterized. The obtained dyes are among the brightest fluorophores in the polymethine family. A single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis unambiguously confirmed the structure of one of the synthesized trianionic dyes.







Abstract
Trianionic polymethines of the A&#8242;&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8242; type comprising dioxaborine rings (A) and different electron&#8208;accepting end groups (A&#8242;) have been synthesized. The obtained dyes absorb and emit light in the near&#8208;infrared region with remarkably high molar attenuation coefficients (&#1013; up to 495&#8201;000&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 in DMF) and fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;f up to 0.73 in DMF). Thus, the novel trianionic dyes stand among the brightest individual fluorophores known to date &#8211; with a magnitude of fluorescence brightness (&#1013;&#8901;&#934;f) of 313&#8201;000&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 in DMF. The synthesized dyes demonstrate a minor negative solvatochromism and small Stokes shifts. X&#8208;ray data reveal the nearly planar geometry of the trianionic chromophore. All the obtained compounds are stable in the solid state and in a solution, although the relative stability is much higher in polar aprotic than in protic solvents.

         <title>CH&#8208;&#960; Multi&#8208;Interaction&#8208;Driven Recognition and Isolation of Planar Compounds in a Spheroidal Polyaromatic Cavity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyaromatic capsule with a spheroidal cavity displays superior binding abilities toward planar compounds through multiple CH&#8208;&#960; interactions (up to 32). In the cavity, one molecule of polyaromatic coronene is exclusively bound from mixtures and one molecule of Cu(II) complexes is bound quantitatively and isolated from bulk phases.







Abstract
&#960;&#8208;&#960; Interactions are established as a powerful supramolecular tool, whereas the usability of CH&#8208;&#960; interactions has been rather limited so far. Here we present (i)&#8197;selective binding of planar polyaromatics and (ii)&#8197;effective isolation of planar metal complexes by a polyaromatic capsule, utilizing multiple CH&#8208;&#960; interactions. In the spheroidal cavity, one molecule of large and medium&#8208;sized polyaromatic molecules (i.&#8201;e., coronene and pyrene) is exclusively bound from mixtures bearing the same number of aromatic CH groups. Theoretical studies reveal that multiple host&#8208;guest CH&#8208;&#960; interactions (up to 32&#8197;interactions) are the predominant driving force for the observed selectivity. In addition, one molecule of planar metal complexes (i.&#8201;e., porphine and bis(acetylacetonato) Cu(II) complexes) is quantitatively bound by the capsule through aromatic and aliphatic CH&#8208;&#960; multi&#8208;interactions, respectively. The ESR and theoretical studies demonstrate the isolation capability of the capsular framework and an unusual polar environment in the polyaromatic cavity.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Observable Interconversion Between Si(IV) and Si(II) via Reversible Intramolecular Insertion Into an Aromatic C&#8722;C Bond</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a new silepin with a sterically encumbered silyl ligand was achieved, which shows a spectral observable equilibrium towards the isomeric acyclic silylene at room temperature. The equilibrium was analyzed by VT&#8197;NMR and UV/Vis measurements supported by DFT calculations. Furthermore, the reactivity of the silepin/silylen towards small molecules was investigated.







Abstract
An easily isolable silacycloheptatriene (silepin) 1&#8201;b was synthesized from the reaction of a N&#8208;heterocyclic imino (IPrN) substituted tribromosilane IPrNSiBr3 with the sterically congested bis(trimethylsilyl)triisopropylsilyl silanide KSi(TMS)2Si(iPr)3 (BTTPS). In solution, the Si(IV) silepin 1&#8201;b is in a thermodynamic equilibrium with the acyclic Si(II) silylene 1&#8201;a. The relative concentration of the Si(II) or Si(IV) isomers can be controlled by temperature variation and observed by variable temperature NMR and UV/Vis spectroscopy. DFT calculations show a small reaction barrier for the Si(II)&#8652;Si(IV) interconversion and a small energy gap between the Si(II) and Si(IV) species. The reactivity of 1&#8201;a/b is demonstrated on a variety of small molecules.

         <title>Phosphoric&#8208;Acid Retention in High&#8208;Temperature Proton&#8208;Exchange Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strategies to improve PA retention: The leakage of phosphoric acid (PA) from PA&#8208;doped proton&#8208;exchange membranes (PEMs) is a key issue for high&#8208;temperature proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (HT&#8208;PEMFCs). The detailed discussion of the recent progress to mitigate the PA loss in HT&#8208;PEMs is described in this Concept. Moreover, a new idea is provided on how to decrease the leaching of PA in PEMs with a high acid concentration, and how to address the remaining technical issues.







Abstract
Great efforts have been conducted to develop high temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell (HT&#8208;PEMFC) due to its features of enhanced electrocatalyst reactivity, simplified hydrothermal management system and high CO tolerance of catalysts, and remarkable progress has been achieved. However, the easy leaching of phosphoric acid (PA) from the membranes during operation limits its commercial scale&#8208;up in complicated environments. This concept here mainly focuses on the recent developments for mitigation of PA loss in PEMs. The probable mechanisms of PA loss are proposed. The approaches to improve PA retention for example via introduction of phosphonic acid by covalent bond, using ion&#8208;pairs interaction and siphoning effect, and blending with inorganic nanoparticles are described in detail. Among these strategies, the siphoning effect from the intrinsic microporous PEMs is the most efficient and enables the cell to operate flexibly within a broad temperature range. Therefore, this concept may provide new ideas for the scientists to retain PA, to improve the cell performance and expand the potential applications of PA doped PEMs at elevated humidity and wide temperature range.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Strategies to improve PA retention&lt;/b&gt;: The leakage of phosphoric acid (PA) from PA-doped proton-exchange membranes (PEMs) is a key issue for high-temperature proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (HT-PEMFCs). The detailed discussion of the recent progress to mitigate the PA loss in HT-PEMs is described in this Concept. Moreover, a new idea is provided on how to decrease the leaching of PA in PEMs with a high acid concentration, and how to address the remaining technical issues.

         <title>Oligonucleotides Featuring a Covalently Mercurated 6&#8208;Phenylcarbazole Residue as High&#8208;Affinity Hybridization Probes for Thiopyrimidine&#8208;Containing Sequences</title>

Getting back to (nucleo)base: Oligonucleotides incorporating a central 1&#8208; or 8&#8208;mercuri&#8208;6&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;carbazole residue show great promise as high&#8208;affinity hybridization probes, discriminating between all canonical nucleobases as well as 2&#8208; and 4&#8208;thiothymines by melting temperature margins of at least 5&#8201;&#176;C. Duplexes facilitating HgII&#8722;S coordination were particularly stable, with melting temperatures nearly 30&#8201;&#176;C higher than those of respective unmodified duplexes.







Abstract
Short oligonucleotides incorporating either 1&#8208;mercuri&#8208;6&#8208;phenylcarbazole, 8&#8208;mercuri&#8208;6&#8208;phenylcarbazole, or 1,8&#8208;dimercuri&#8208;6&#8208;phenylcarbazole C&#8208;nucleoside in the middle of the chain have been synthesized and studied for their potential as hybridization probes for sequences containing thiopyrimidine nucleobases. All of these oligonucleotides formed very stable duplexes with complementary sequences pairing the organometallic moiety with either 2&#8208; or 4&#8208;thiothymine. The isomeric monomercurated oligonucleotides were also able to discriminate between 2&#8208; and 4&#8208;thiothymine based on the different melting temperatures of the respective duplexes. DFT&#8208;optimized structures of the most stable mononuclear HgII&#8208;mediated base pairs featured a coordinated covalent bond between HgII and either S2 or S4 and a hydrogen bond between the carbazole nitrogen and N3. The dinuclear HgII&#8208;mediated base pairs, in turn, were geometrically very similar to the one previously reported to form between 1,8&#8208;dimercuri&#8208;6&#8208;phenylcarbazole and thymine and had one HgII ion coordinated to a thio and the other one to an oxo substituent.

Ortho&#8208;iodo diaryl ethers are selectively transformed into either oxygen&#8208;bridged cyclic diaryliodonium salts or ortho&#8208;aryloxy&#8208;substituted acyclic diaryliodonium salts through regioselective and high&#8208;yielding one&#8208;pot routes.

Abstract
Two regioselective, high&#8208;yielding one&#8208;pot routes to oxygen&#8208;bridged cyclic diaryliodonium salts and ortho&#8208;aryloxy&#8208;substituted acyclic diaryliodonium salts are presented. Starting from easily available ortho&#8208;iodo diaryl ethers, complete selectivity in formation of either the cyclic or acyclic product could be achieved by varying the reaction conditions.

         <title>Modulation of Metal Carbonyl Stretching Frequencies in the Second Coordination Sphere through the Internal Stark Effect</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbonyl stretching frequencies of late transition metal pybox complexes demonstrate the intrinsic role of internal electric fields in metal&#8208;carbonyl bonding.







Abstract
Spectroscopic and computational examination of a homologous series of rhodium(I) pybox carbonyl complexes has revealed a correlation between the conformation of the flanking aryl&#8208;substituted oxazoline donors and the carbonyl stretching frequency. This relationship is also observed experimentally for octahedral rhodium(III) and ruthenium(II) variants and cannot be explained through the classical, Dewar&#8211;Chatt&#8211;Duncanson, interpretation of metal&#8208;carbonyl bonding. Instead, these findings are reconciled by local changes in the magnitude of the electric field that is projected along the metal&#8208;carbonyl vector: the internal Stark effect.

         <title>Interface Engineering of Conjugated Polymer&#8208;Based Composites for Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conjugated polymer (CP)&#8208;based composites are potential candidates for solving environmental issues through photocatalysis process. Interface engineering can construct tight interfaces in these composites and further achieve high performance in various photocatalytic applications. In this review, we focus on the characteristics, roles, and regulation methods of different interfacial interactions as well as building methods based on these factors to construct well&#8208;formed interfaces.







Abstract
Photocatalysis can create a green way to produce clean energy resources, degrade pollutants and achieve carbon neutrality, making the construction of efficient photocatalysts significant in solving environmental issues. Conjugated polymers (CPs) with adjustable band structures have superior light&#8208;absorption capacity and flexible morphology that facilitate contact with other components to form advanced heterojunctions. Interface engineering can strengthen the interfacial contact between the components and further enlarge the interfacial contact area, enhance light absorption, accelerate charge transfer and improve the reusability of the composites. In order to throw some new light on heterojunction interface regulation at a molecular level, herein we summarize CP&#8208;based composites with improved photocatalytic performance according to the types of interactions (covalent bonding, hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, and other polar interactions) between the components and introduce the corresponding interface building methods, identifying techniques. Then the roles of interfaces in different photocatalytic applications are discussed. Finally, we sum up the existing problems in interface engineering of CP&#8208;based composites and look forward to the possible solutions.

         <title>Regiodivergent Asymmetric Pyridinium Additions: Mechanistic Insight and Synthetic Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regiodivergent asymmetric dearomatization of readily accessible pyridines has enabled the redox&#8208;economic synthesis of both (+)&#8208;N&#8208;Methylaspidospermidine and (&#8722;)&#8208;Paroxetine. A mechanistic rationale for the regiodivergent pyridinium additions and evaluation of their scope was also explored.







Abstract
A practical protocol for the first regiodivergent asymmetric addition of aryl and alkenyl organometallic reagents to substituted N&#8208;alkyl pyridinium heterocycles is described. The couplings proceed with high regiochemical and stereochemical selectivities, and provide access to chiral 1,2,3&#8208; and 1,3,4&#8208;trisubstituted dihydropyridine products, controlled by judicious choice of nitrogen activating agent. To this end, a correlation was found between the parameterized size of the activating group and the C2/C4 regioselectivity in the couplings. The utility of the described chemistry was demonstrated in two concise asymmetric syntheses of (+)&#8208;N&#8208;methylaspidospermidine and (&#8722;)&#8208;paroxetine.

A mechanistic rationale for the regiodivergent pyridinium additions and evaluation of their scope was also explored.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A practical protocol for the first regiodivergent asymmetric addition of aryl and alkenyl organometallic reagents to substituted &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-alkyl pyridinium heterocycles is described. The couplings proceed with high regiochemical and stereochemical selectivities, and provide access to chiral 1,2,3- and 1,3,4-trisubstituted dihydropyridine products, controlled by judicious choice of nitrogen activating agent. To this end, a correlation was found between the parameterized size of the activating group and the C2/C4 regioselectivity in the couplings. The utility of the described chemistry was demonstrated in two concise asymmetric syntheses of (+)-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methylaspidospermidine and (&#8722;)-paroxetine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A novel La(III)&#8208;based two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8208;organic framework, [La2/3(qptca)1/2] was successfully synthesized from LaCl3 and 1,1&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;4&#8242;,1&#8242;&#8201;&#8242;:&#8201;4&#8242;&#8242;,1&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;4&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;,1&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;quinquephenyl]&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;tetracarboxylic acid (H4qptca) by conventional solvothermal method.

Abstract
In this study, a novel La(III)&#8208;based two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8208;organic framework, [La2/3(qptca)1/2] (referred to as SLX&#8208;2), from LaCl3 and 1,1&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;4&#8242;,1&#8242;&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;4&#8242;&#8242;,1&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;4&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;,1&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;quinquephenyl]&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;tetracarboxylic acid (H4qptca) was synthesized by conventional solvothermal method and thoroughly characterized by using X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal diffraction, powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, and thermogravimetric analyses. The 2D SLX&#8208;2 features a unique lanthanum center exposed to the skeleton and was used as an efficient Lewis acid catalyst for the Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation of indole and pyrrole with &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene along with a wide substrate scope, giving the desired products in good&#8208;to&#8208;high yields under the optimal reaction conditions. Furthermore, the catalyst was used for twenty cycles, with nearly no effect on its activity, and the reaction was heterogeneous in nature. Moreover, compared to the previous hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;donating MOF catalysts for such alkylation reactions, SLX&#8208;2 showed an excellent stability toward harsh acidic and basic environment, and gave comparable catalytic activities.

         <title>A Plausible Prebiotic Path to Nucleosides: Ribosides and Related Aldosides are Generated from Ribulose, Fructose, and Similar Abiotic Precursors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The prebiotic origins of ribose, nucleosides, and eventually RNA are enduring questions whose answers are central to the RNA World hypothesis. The abiotic synthesis of sugars was first demonstrated over a century ago, but no known prebiotic reaction produces ribose (an aldose sugar) selectively and in good yield. In contrast, ribulose and fructose (ketose sugars) and other monosaccharides are formed in high yield by several robust abiotic reactions. We report here that ketose sugars&#8212;both ketopentoses and ketohexoes&#8212;serve as precursors for the formation of ribosides and other aldosides, as demonstrated by glycoside&#8208;forming reactions involving barbituric acid, a plausibly prebiotic nucleobase. Moreover, we discovered a one&#8208;pot reaction of glyceraldehyde and barbituric acid that under mild conditions, and without special minerals or other catalysts, results in the formation of glycosides. These results reveal that an exclusive or high&#8208;yielding generation of free ribose was not required for its incorporation into processes that provided the foundations for life.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report the synthesis and late&#8208;stage diversification of a new class of hetero&#8208;buckybowl, BN&#8208;embedded dibenzocorannulenes (  B  2  N  2  &#8208;DBC  s). The synthesis is achieved via one&#8208;shot halogenative borylation, comprising the nitrogen&#8208;directed haloboration of alkyne and an intramolecular bora&#8208;Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction, which provides BN&#8208;embedded dibenzocorannulene possessing two bromo substituents (  B  2  N  2  &#8208;DBC&#8208;Br  ).  B  2  N  2  &#8208;DBC&#8208;Br  undergoes diversification via coupling reactions to provide a variety of arylated derivatives (  B  2  N  2  &#8208;DBC&#8208;R  ), exhibiting strong blue fluorescence. An organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) employing one of the derivatives as an emitter exhibited a high external quantum efficiency of 6.6% and long operational lifetime of 907 h at an initial luminance of 1000 cd m  &#8211;2  , indicating the significant potential for the development of efficient and stable hetero&#8208;buckybowl&#8208;based OLED materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Theoretical Perspectives in Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 58, October 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Computational approaches to organocatalysis: This review is focused on the different computational approaches that have been applied within the organocatalysis field. A huge effort from the theoretical chemistry field has been made in order to prove that de novo design of effective catalysts for different types of reactions is a long&#8208;term target, yet a palpable phenomenon.







Abstract
It is clear that the field of organocatalysis is continuously expanding during the last decades. With increasing computational capacity and new techniques, computational methods have provided a more economic approach to explore different chemical systems. This review offers a broad yet concise overview of current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art studies that have employed novel strategies for catalyst design. The evolution of the all different theoretical approaches most commonly used within organocatalysis is discussed, from the traditional approach, manual&#8208;driven, to the most recent one, machine&#8208;driven.

         <title>In situ Grignard Metalation Method, Part II: Scope of the One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Organocalcium Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 58, October 18, 2022. </description>

The in&#8197;situ Grignard metalation method is a powerful tool for the synthesis of Ca(hmds)2. Steric hindrance and side reactions occasionally prevent a straightforward application of this strategy but in these cases stoichiometric metalation reactions offer a way out.







Abstract
The in&#8197;situ Grignard Metalation Method (iGMM) is a straightforward one&#8208;pot strategy to synthesize alkaline&#8208;earth metal amides in multi&#8208;gram scale with high yields via addition of bromoethane to an ethereal suspension of a primary or secondary amine and magnesium (Part&#8197;I) or calcium (Part&#8197;II). This method is highly advantageous because no activation of calcium is required prior to the reaction. Contrary to the magnesium&#8208;based iGMM, there are some limitations, the most conspicuous one is the large influence of steric factors. The preparation of Ca(hmds)2 succeeds smoothly within a few hours with excellent yields opening the opportunity to prepare large amounts of this reagent. Side reactions and transfer of the iGMM to substituted anilines and N&#8208;heterocycles as well as other H&#8208;acidic substrates such as cyclopentadienes are studied. Bulky amidines cannot be converted directly to calcium amidinates via the iGMM but stoichiometric calciation with Ca(hmds)2 enables their preparation.

         <title>Enhancing Dual&#8208;State Emission in Maleimide Fluorophores through Fluorocarbon Functionalisation</title>

         <dc:description>
A library of trifluoroethyl substituted aminomaleimide derivatives are reported with small size and enhanced emissions in both solution and solid&#8208;state. A diCH2CF3 substituted aminochloromaleimide exhibits the most efficient dual&#8208;state emission (&#934;f &gt;50&#8201;% in solution and solid&#8208;state), with reduced quenching from protic solvents. Hence, these dual&#8208;state dyes overcome the limitations of single&#8208;state luminescence and will serve as an important step forward for this rapidly developing field.

         <title>Efficient and Selective Electroreduction of CO2 to HCOOH over Bismuth&#8208;Based Bromide Perovskites in Acidic Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 58, October 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO2 reduction: Bismuth&#8208;based perovskites are utilized for CO2RR into formic acid in strong acid for the first time. The ingenious use of acidic electrolyte not only helps to stabilize the perovskite phase, but also enhances CO2 reduction rate, maintains a high OCHO* intermediate coverage and suppresses HER by avoiding the OH&#8722; and carbonate formation, addressing the &#8220;alkalinity problem&#8221; in CO2RR.







Abstract
Metal halide perovskites, primarily used as optoelectronic devices, have not been applied for electrochemical conversion due to their insufficient stability in moisture. Herein, two bismuth&#8208;based perovskites are introduced as novel electrocatalysts to convert CO2 into HCOOH in aqueous acidic media (pH&#8197;2.5), exhibiting a high Faradaic efficiency for HCOOH of &gt;80&#8201;% in a wide potential range from &#8722;0.75 to &#8722;1.25&#8197;V. Their structural evolution against water was dynamically monitored by in&#8197;situ spectra. Theoretical calculations further reveal that the formation of intermediate OCHO* on bismuth sites of Cs3Bi2Br9(111) play a pivotal role toward HCOOH production, which has a lower energy barrier than that on Cs2AgBiBr6(001) surfaces. Significantly, CO2 reacts with protons instead of water which can enhance CO2 reduction rate and suppress hydrogen evolution by avoiding carbonate formation in acidic electrolytes. This work paves the way for the extensive investigation of halide perovskites in aqueous systems.

Rhodium complexes bearing a guanidine based NCN pincer ligand were designed and successfully applied to catalytic acrylate synthesis from carbon dioxide and ethylene. The repulsion between p&#960;&#8208;electron of guanidine and filled d&#960; orbital of Rh center increases the electron density on Rh, allowing the first structural characterization of rhodalactone formation.







Abstract
Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed acrylate synthesis from CO2 and ethylene was accomplished by using a guanidine&#8208;based NCN pincer ligand. The repulsion between p&#960;&#8208;electron of guanidine sidearms and occupied d&#960; orbital of rhodium center raised the level of d&#8208;electrons close to those of formerly known d8&#8208;ruthenium catalyst, thereby promoting the metallalactone formation from carbon dioxide and ethylene. This work fills the absence of group&#8208;9 metal based catalyst for the acrylate synthesis and provides a designing approach for pincer&#8208;ligated d8&#8208;metal catalysts to utilize p&#960;&#8208;d&#960; interaction for promoting desirable redox processes.

         <title>Expanding Catch and Release DNA Decoy (CRDD) Technology with Pyrimidine Mimics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 58, October 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Expanding the chemical toolbox: The toolbox of catch and release DNA decoys (CRDDs) has been expanded to pyrimidine mimics. CRDD technology uses photolysis to form abasic sites in DNA. This work shows that a 2&#8208;nitropyrrole (2&#8208;NP) pyrimidine mimic undergoes rapid photochemical cleavage of the anomeric bond to yield an abasic site at a rate comparable to that of the previously reported 7&#8208;nitroindole (7&#8208;NI) purine mimic.







Abstract
Catch and release DNA decoys (CRDDs) utilize photochemically responsive nucleoside analogues that generate abasic sites upon exposure to light. Herein, we describe the synthesis and evaluation of four candidate CRDD monomers containing nucleobases that mimic endogenous pyrimidines: 2&#8208;nitroimidazole (2&#8208;NI), 2&#8208;nitrobenzene (2&#8208;NB), 2&#8208;nitropyrrole (2&#8208;NP) and 3&#8208;nitropyrrole (3&#8208;NP). Our studies reveal that 2&#8208;NI and 2&#8208;NP can function as CRDDs, whereas 3&#8208;NP and 2&#8208;NB undergo decomposition and transformation to a higher&#8208;ordered structure upon photolysis, respectively. When incorporated into DNA, 2&#8208;NP undergoes rapid photochemical cleavage of the anomeric bond (1.8&#8197;min half&#8208;life) to yield an abasic site. Finally, we find that all four pyrimidine mimics show significantly greater stability when base&#8208;paired against the previously reported 7&#8208;nitroindole CRDD monomer. Our work marks the expansion of CRDD technology to both purine and pyrimidine scaffolds.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Expanding the chemical toolbox&lt;/b&gt;: The toolbox of catch and release DNA decoys (CRDDs) has been expanded to pyrimidine mimics. CRDD technology uses photolysis to form abasic sites in DNA. This work shows that a 2-nitropyrrole (&lt;b&gt;2-NP&lt;/b&gt;) pyrimidine mimic undergoes rapid photochemical cleavage of the anomeric bond to yield an abasic site at a rate comparable to that of the previously reported 7-nitroindole (&lt;b&gt;7-NI&lt;/b&gt;) purine mimic.

         <title>Elastin&#8208;Hyaluronan Bioconjugate as Bioactive Component in Electrospun Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 58, October 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The persistence of &#945;&#8208;helix conformation in a bioactive peptide after the conjugation with hyaluronic acid confirms thiol&#8208;ene chemistry as a successful strategy adopting mild conditions. The electrospun scaffolds showed the double advantage of an improved regularity of nanofiber pattern by hyaluronic acid addition and the presence of a bioactive peptide.







Abstract
Hyaluronic acid or hyaluronan (HA) and elastin&#8208;inspired peptides (EL) have been widely recognized as bioinspired materials useful in biomedical applications. The aim of the present work is the production of electrospun scaffolds as wound dressing materials which would benefit from synergic action of the bioactivity of elastin peptides and the regenerative properties of hyaluronic acid. Taking advantage of thiol&#8208;ene chemistry, a bioactive elastin peptide was successfully conjugated to methacrylated hyaluronic acid (MAHA) and electrospun together with poly&#8208;D,L&#8208;lactide (PDLLA). To the best of our knowledge, limited reports on peptide&#8208;conjugated hyaluronic acid were described in literature, and none of these was employed for the production of electrospun scaffolds. The conformational studies carried out by Circular Dichroism (CD) on the bioconjugated compound confirmed the preservation of secondary structure of the peptide after conjugation while Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) revealed the supramolecular structure of the electrospun scaffolds. Overall, the study demonstrates that the bioconjugation of hyaluronic acid with the elastin peptide improved the electrospinning processability with improved characteristics in terms of morphology of the final scaffolds.

         <title>Branched Tertiary Amines from Aldehydes and &#945;&#8208;Olefins by Combined Multiphase Tandem Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 58, October 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transformation of olefins to branched amines is presented by combining a hydroformylation/aldol condensation tandem reaction with the reductive amination in a combined multiphase system that each can be recycled 9 times. The product phase of the first system is the substrate phase for the second recycling. The yields are stable during those recycling runs and the leaching is low with 0.09&#8201;% over the two recycling stages.







Abstract
This study presents the transformation of olefins to branched amines by combining a hydroformylation/aldol condensation tandem reaction with the reductive amination in a combined multiphase system that can be recycled 9 times. The products are branched amines that are precursors for surfactants. Since the multiphase hydrofomylation/aldol condensation system has already been studied, the first step was to develop the partial hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes together with a subsequent reductive amination. The rhodium/phosphine catalyst is immobilized in a polar polyethylene phase which separates from the product phase after the reaction. Reaction and catalyst recycling are demonstrated by the conversion of the C14&#8208;aldehyde 2&#8208;pentylnonenal with the dimethylamine surrogate dimethylammonium dimethylcarbamate to the corresponding tertiary amine with yields up to 88&#8201;% and an average rhodium leaching of less than 0.1&#8201;% per recycling run. Furthermore, the positive influence of a Bronsted acid and carbon monoxide on the selectivity are discussed. Finally, the two PEG based systems have been merged in one recycling approach, by using the product phase of the hydroformylation aldol condensation reaction for the reductive amination reaction. The yields are stable during a nine recycling runs and the leaching low with 0.09&#8201;% over the two recycling stages.

         <title>Controlling the Emissive, Chiroptical, and Electrochemical Properties of Double [7] Helicenes through Embedded Aromatic Rings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 58, October 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling the photophysics of double helicenes is facilely achieved by variation of the terminal aromatic rings. Compared to the thiadiazole&#8208;fused and all&#8208;carbon analogs, triazole&#8208;fused double helicene shows significantly enhanced emission with near&#8208;unity quantum yield, and high circularly polarized luminescence brightness of up to 30.1&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1, as well as excellent ambipolar redox behavior.







Abstract
We present here the synthesis and in&#8208;depth physicochemical characterization of a double hetero[7]helicene fused with four triazole rings at both helical ends. The comparison of this triazole&#8208;fused double helicene with the previously reported all&#8208;carbon and thiadiazole&#8208;fused analogs revealed the huge impact of the embedded aromatic rings on the photophysical features. The small structural variation of the terminal rings from thiadiazole to triazole caused a dramatic change of the photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) from &lt;1&#8201;% to 96&#8201;%, while the replacement of the terminal benzene rings with triazole rings induced a tenfold enhancement of the circularly polarized luminescence dissymmetry factor. These observations were well corroborated with transient absorption analysis and/or theoretic calculations. In addition, the triazole&#8208;fused double helicene exhibited ambipolar redox behavior, enabling the generation of radical cation and anion species by electrochemical and chemical methods and showing its potential for spin&#8208;related applications.

         <title>Indole&#8208;Based Long&#8208;Wavelength Fluorescent Probes for Bioimaging of S&#8208;Nitrosylation in Mitochondria</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 58, October 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel indole&#8208;based fluorophore was designed and synthesized, exhibiting long&#8208;wavelength emission and high quantum yield. Functionalization of the 7&#8208;position of the indole ring with an arylphosphine ester resulted with a unique mitochondria&#8208;targeting fluorescent probe for direct detection of S&#8208;nitrosylation within mitochondria of living cells.







Abstract
S&#8208;Nitrosylation has been found to play an important role in regulating mitochondrial function. However, probes for detection of protein S&#8208;nitrosylation in mitochondria remain unexplored. Herein, a novel 4&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)vinyl&#8208;substituted indole was designed, exhibiting a long&#8208;wavelength emission and a high fluorescent quantum yield. Functionalization of the 7&#8208;position of the indole ring with an arylphosphine ester resulted with probes with efficient mitochondria&#8208;targeting ability. Furthermore, the indole&#8208;arylphosphine displayed a significant fluorescence enhancement upon exposure to S&#8208;nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) at low micromolar concentrations in A431&#8197;cells. Taken together, this study provides a new indole&#8208;based fluorescent probe with a unique long&#8208;wavelength emission for direct detection of S&#8208;nitrosylation in mitochondria, which may represent a powerful tool for understanding the critical roles of S&#8208;nitrosylation within mitochondria of living organisms.

         <title>Mechanochemical Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling of Arylhalides and Organozinc Pivalates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 58, October 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical conditions prove useful for many important metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions. It was shown that efficient Negishi cross&#8208;coupling can be realized by using air&#8208;stable and solid organozinc pivalates. Ball&#8208;milling affords a range of (hetero)biaryl compounds in very good yields under ambient conditions on air. A short synthesis of analgetic drug diflunisal was also performed.







Abstract
Cross&#8208;coupling reactions are essential tools in target molecule synthesis. However, the use of highly reactive organometallic reagents limits their applicability. Here, we present a mechanochemical Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction between aryl halides and organozinc pivalates that can be carried out under ambient temperature and atmosphere. This operationally simple procedure affords a wide range of biaryl and aryl&#8208;heteroaryl derivatives in high yields and short times. The reaction tolerates various functional groups and can be realized on a synthetically useful scale. Its practical value was demonstrated in the short synthesis of the pharmaceutical diflunisal.

         <title>Harnessing Water to Enhance Quadrupolar NMR Spectroscopy and Imaging</title>

17O and 14N are attractive targets for in&#8197;vivo NMR imaging, but low gyromagnetic ratios &#947; and fast spin relaxation complicate observations. This work explores indirect ways to detect some of these sites with the help of double&#8208;resonance techniques. These sequences ported the signatures of dilute, low&#8208;g nuclei onto the abundant water 1H signal through the spontaneous exchanges that labile OH and NH protons undergo with H2O. These effects provide new routes in molecular NMR imaging.







Abstract
17O and 14N are attractive targets for in&#8197;vivo NMR spectroscopy and imaging, but low gyromagnetic ratios &#947; and fast spin relaxation complicate observations. This work explores indirect ways of detecting some of these sites with the help of proton&#8208;detected double resonance techniques. As standard coherence transfer methods are of limited use for such indirect detection, alternative routes for probing the quadrupolar spectra on 1H were tested. These centered on modulating the broadening effects imparted onto protons adjacent to the low&#8208;&#947; species through J couplings through either continuous wave or spin&#8208;echo double&#8208;resonance decoupling/recoupling sequences. As in all cases, the changes imparted by these double&#8208;resonance strategies were small due to the fast relaxation undergone by the quadrupoles, the sensitivity of these approaches was amplified by transferring their effects onto the abundant water 1H signal. These amplifications were mediated by the spontaneous exchanges that the labile 1Hs bound to 17O or 14N undergo with the water protons. In experiments designed on the basis of double&#8208;resonance spin echoes, these enhancements were imparted by looping the transverse encodings together with multiple longitudinal storage periods, leading to decoupling&#8208;recoupling with exchange (D&#8208;REX) sequences. In experiments designed on the basis of continuous on/off quadrupolar decoupling, these solvent exchanges were incorporated into chemical&#8208;exchange saturation transfer schemes, leading to decoupling&#8208;recoupling with saturation transfer (D&#8208;REST) sequences. Both of these variants harnessed sizable proportions of the easily detectable water signals, in order to characterize the NMR spectra and/or to image with atomic&#8208;site specificity the 17O and 14N species.

         <title>Encapsulated Neutral Ruthenium Catalyst for Substrate&#8208;Selective Oxidation of Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 58, October 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experimental and theoretical investigations performed on a neutral ruthenium complex immobilized inside a self&#8208;assembled hexameric capsule showed that its formation is enabled by supramolecular interactions between the first coordination sphere of the ruthenium and the aromatic rings of the capsule. Substrate size selectivity was observed when the inclusion complex was assessed in the catalytic oxidation of alcohols.







Abstract
The neutral complex dichloro&#8208;{diethyl[(5&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylamino)&#8208;(4&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;methylphenyl)methyl]phosphonate} (p&#8208;cymene)&#8208;ruthenium(II) was encapsulated inside a self&#8208;assembled hexameric host obtained upon reaction of 2,8,14,20&#8208;tetra&#8208;undecyl&#8208;resorcin[4]arene and water. The formation of an inclusion complex was inferred from a combination of spectral measurements (MS, UV/Vis spectroscopy, 1H and DOSY NMR). The 31P and 19F NMR spectra are consistent with motions of the ruthenium complex inside the self&#8208;assembled capsule. Molecular dynamics simulations carried out on the inclusion complex confirmed these intra&#8208;cavity movements and highlighted possible supramolecular interactions between the ruthenium first coordination sphere ligands and the inner part (aromatic rings) of the capsule. The embedded ruthenium complex was assessed in the catalytic oxidation (using NaIO4 as oxidant) of mixtures of three arylmethyl alcohols into the corresponding aldehydes. The reaction kinetics were shown to vary as a function of the substrates&#8217; size, with the oxidation rate varying in the order benzylalcohol &gt;4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;benzylalcohol &gt;9&#8208;anthracenemethanol. Control experiments realized in the absence of hexameric capsule did not allow any discrimination between the substrates.

P=O&#8594;Element coordination keeps going and double cyclization involving the O, C, O&#8208;coordinating pincer&#8208;type ligand [5&#8208;t&#8208;Bu&#8208;1,3&#8208;{(P(O)(O&#8208;i&#8208;Pr)2}2C6H2]&#8722; was achieved for the first time in case of the aryldiphenyldioxaphosphorane 9&#8208;t&#8208;Bu&#8208;2,6&#8208;(OH)&#8208;4,4&#8208;Ph2&#8208;3,5&#8208;O2&#8208;2,6&#8208;P2&#8208;4&#955;5&#8208;P&#8208;[5.3.1.0]&#8208;undeca&#8208;1(10),7(11),8&#8208;triene, existing as two diastereomers.







Abstract
The sequence of reactions of the phosphorus&#8208;containing aryllithium compound 5&#8208;t&#8208;Bu&#8208;1,3&#8208;[(P(O)(O&#8208;i&#8208;Pr)2]2C6H2Li (ArLi) with Ph2PCl, KMnO4, elemental sulfur and elemental selenium, respectively, gave the aryldiphenylphosphane chalcogenides 5&#8208;t&#8208;Bu&#8208;1,3&#8208;[(P(O)(O&#8208;i&#8208;Pr)2]2C6H2P(E)Ph2 (1, E=O; 2, E=S; 3, E=Se). Compound 1 partially hydrolysed giving [5&#8208;t&#8208;Bu&#8208;1&#8208;{(P(O)(O&#8208;i&#8208;Pr)2}&#8208;3&#8208;{(P(O)(OH)2}C6H2]P(O)Ph2 (4). The reaction of ArLi with PhPCl2 provided the benzoxaphosphaphosphole [1(P), 3(P)&#8208;P(O)(O&#8208;i&#8208;Pr)OPPh&#8208;6&#8208;t&#8208;Bu&#8208;4&#8208;P(O)(O&#8208;i&#8208;Pr)2]C6H2P (5i) as a mixture of the two diastereomers. The oxidation of 5i with elemental sulfur gave the benzoxaphosphaphosphole sulfide [1(P), 3(P)&#8208;P(O)(O&#8208;i&#8208;Pr)OP(S)Ph&#8208;6&#8208;t&#8208;Bu&#8208;4&#8208;P(O)(O&#8208;i&#8208;Pr)2]C6H2 (5) as pair of enantiomers P1(R), P3(S)/P1(S), P3(R) of the diastereomer (RS/SR)&#8208;5 (5b). The aryldiphenylphosphane 5&#8208;t&#8208;Bu&#8208;1,3&#8208;[(P(O)(O&#8208;i&#8208;Pr)2]2C6H2PPh2 (6) was obtained from the reaction of the corresponding aryldiphenylphosphane sulfide 2 with either sodium hydride, NaH, or disodium iron tetracarbonyl, Na2Fe(CO)4. The oxidation of the aryldiphenylphosphane 6 with elemental iodine and subsequent hydrolysis yielded the aryldiphenyldioxaphosphorane 9&#8208;t&#8208;Bu&#8208;2,6&#8208;(OH)&#8208;4,4&#8208;Ph2&#8208;3,5&#8208;O2&#8208;2,6&#8208;P2&#8208;4&#955;5&#8208;P&#8208;[5.3.1.0]&#8208;undeca&#8208;1(10),7(11),8&#8208;triene (7). Both of its diastereomers, (RR/SS)&#8208;7 (7a) and (RS/SR)&#8208;7 (7b), were separated as their chloroform and i&#8208;propanol solvates, 7a&#8901;2CHCl3 and 7b&#8901;i&#8208;PrOH, respectively.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sequence of reactions of the phosphorus-containing aryllithium compound 5-&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-Bu-1,3-[(P(O)(O-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;-Pr)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Li (ArLi) with Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PCl, KMnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, elemental sulfur and elemental selenium, respectively, gave the aryldiphenylphosphane chalcogenides 5-&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-Bu-1,3-[(P(O)(O-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;-Pr)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P(E)Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, E=O; &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, E=S; &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;, E=Se). Compound &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; partially hydrolysed giving [5-&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-Bu-1-{(P(O)(O-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;-Pr)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}-3-{(P(O)(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]P(O)Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;). The reaction of ArLi with PhPCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; provided the benzoxaphosphaphosphole [1(P), 3(P)-P(O)(O-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;-Pr)OPPh-6-&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-Bu-4-P(O)(O-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;-Pr)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P (&lt;b&gt;5i&lt;/b&gt;) as a mixture of the two diastereomers. The oxidation of &lt;b&gt;5i&lt;/b&gt; with elemental sulfur gave the benzoxaphosphaphosphole sulfide [1(P), 3(P)-P(O)(O-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;-Pr)OP(S)Ph-6-&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-Bu-4-P(O)(O-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;-Pr)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;) as pair of enantiomers P1(&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;), P3(&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)/P1(&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;), P3(&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;) of the diastereomer (&lt;i&gt;RS/SR&lt;/i&gt;)-&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;b&gt;5b&lt;/b&gt;).

         <title>Bola&#8208;Amphiphilic Glycodendrimers: New Carbohydrate&#8208;Mimicking Scaffolds to Target Carbohydrate&#8208;Binding Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 58, October 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart dumbbell: Innovative bola&#8208;amphiphilic glycodendrimers with mannose and glucose terminals have been designed and synthesized. They demonstrated stronger binding to the carbohydrate&#8208;binding protein ConA than conventional amphiphilic glycodendrimers thanks to their unique dumbbell&#8208;like structure. In addition, these bola&#8208;dendrimers targeted mannose receptors and glucose transporters for effective cellular uptake, and thus hold great promise in carbohydrate&#8208;binding protein&#8208;targeted drug delivery.







Abstract
Dendrimers are appealing scaffolds for creating carbohydrate mimics with unique multivalent cooperativity. We report here novel bola&#8208;amphiphilic glycodendrimers bearing mannose and glucose terminals, and a hydrophobic thioacetal core responsive to reactive oxygen species. The peculiar bola&#8208;amphiphilic feature enabled stronger binding to lectin compared to conventional amphiphiles. In addition, these dendrimers are able to target mannose receptors and glucose transporters expressed at the surface of cells, thus allowing effective and specific cellular uptake. This highlights their great promise for targeted delivery.

Highly enantioselective &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethylated aliphatic, aromatic, and heterocyclic boronic acids and boronates were synthesized from simple feedstocks.







Abstract
A broad range of aliphatic, aromatic, and heterocyclic boronic acids were successfully homologated using trifluorodiazoethane in the presence of BINOL derivatives to provide the corresponding chiral trifluoromethyl containing boronic acid derivatives in high yields and excellent enantioselectivity. The in situ conversion of the chiral transient boronic acids to the corresponding alcohols or &#946;&#8208;CF3 carboxylates are also demonstrated.

         <title>Discovery of Complex Binding and Reaction Mechanisms from Ternary Gases in Rare Earth Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>

Ab initio molecular dynamic (AIMD) calculations were carried out for H2O, NO2 and SO2 gas mixtures in rare earth (Y, Eu, Tb and Yb) 2,5&#8208;dihydroxyterepthalic acid (RE&#8208;DOBDC) MOFs. The results reveal formation of secondary gases inside the MOF pore and the identification of four unique adsorption sites.







Abstract
Understanding the selectivity of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) to complex acid gas streams will enable their use in industrial applications. Herein, ab initio molecular dynamic simulations (AIMD) were used to simulate ternary gas mixtures (H2O&#8208;NO2&#8208;SO2)&#160;in rare earth 2,5&#8208;dihydroxyterephthalic acid (RE&#8208;DOBDC) MOFs. Stronger H2O gas&#8208;metal binding arose from thermal vibrations in the MOF sterically hindering access of SO2 and NO2 molecules to the metal sites. Gas&#8208;gas and gas&#8208;linker interactions within the MOF framework resulted in the formation of multiple secondary gas species including HONO, HNO2, NOSO, and HNO3&#8722;. Four gas adsorption sites were identified along with a new de&#8208;protonation reaction mechanism not observable through experiment. This study not only provides valuable information on competitive gas binding energies in the MOF, it also provides important chemical insights into transient chemical reactions and mechanisms.

         <title>Efficient Water Cleaning by Self&#8208;standing Carbon Nitride Films Derived from Supramolecular Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 58, October 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;standing carbon nitride films were prepared by drying and calcinating tailored supramolecular hydrogels composed of melamine and 4&#8208;cyanobenzoic acid. The resulting self&#8208;standing films were employed as filters combining adsorption and photodegradation of organic pollutants showing remarkable activity and stability in flow conditions.







Abstract
The design of efficient self&#8208;standing hybrid systems for water purification that combines good adsorption properties with high photodegradation ability is highly challenging owing to the difficulty in simultaneously controlling the band structure and porosity of a semiconductor while maintaining its self&#8208;standing nature. Here, we report the synthesis of carbon&#8208;rich carbon nitride self&#8208;standing filters from supramolecular hydrogels composed of melamine and cyanobenzoic acid.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Self-standing carbon nitride films&lt;/b&gt; were prepared by drying and calcinating tailored supramolecular hydrogels composed of melamine and 4-cyanobenzoic acid. The resulting self-standing films were employed as filters combining adsorption and photodegradation of organic pollutants showing remarkable activity and stability in flow conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design of efficient self-standing hybrid systems for water purification that combines good adsorption properties with high photodegradation ability is highly challenging owing to the difficulty in simultaneously controlling the band structure and porosity of a semiconductor while maintaining its self-standing nature. Here, we report the synthesis of carbon-rich carbon nitride self-standing filters from supramolecular hydrogels composed of melamine and cyanobenzoic acid. The influence of the chemical structure on the properties of the hydrogels and the final films was studied by tuning parameters such as monomer nature, molar ratio, and pyrolysis temperature. Thanks to their ability to combine the adsorption and photodegradation of organic pollutants, the prepared self-standing films showed remarkable activity and stability in flow conditions (&amp;gt;95&#8201;% efficiency after 10&#8197;consecutive cycles). Additionally, the photocatalytic activity of the films was assessed in the powder form for the hydrogen evolution reaction and photocurrent generation in a photoelectrochemical cell. The reported work opens opportunities for the controlled synthesis of multifunctional filters for water purification and other energy-related and sustainable technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanism of BPh3&#8208;Catalyzed N&#8208;Methylation of Amines with CO2 and Phenylsilane: Cooperative Activation of Hydrosilane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 58, October 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
BPh3 smoothly catalyzes the N&#8208;methylation of N&#8208;methylaniline with CO2 and PhSiH3. A zwitterionic carbamate, composed of N&#8208;methylaniline and CO2, and BPh3 act as nucleophile and Lewis acid, respectively, for the activation of PhSiH3 to generate [HBPh3]&#8722;, which is used to produce the silyl formate and bis(silyl)acetal that are essential for N&#8208;methylation.







Abstract
BPh3 catalyzes the N&#8208;methylation of secondary amines and the C&#8208;methylenation (methylene&#8208;bridge formation between aromatic rings) of N,N&#8208;dimethylanilines or 1&#8208;methylindoles in the presence of CO2 and PhSiH3; these reactions proceed at 30&#8211;40&#8201;&#176;C under solvent&#8208;free conditions. In contrast, B(C6F5)3 shows little or no activity. 11B&#8197;NMR spectra suggested the generation of [HBPh3]&#8722;. The detailed mechanism of the BPh3&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;methylation of N&#8208;methylaniline (1) with CO2 and PhSiH3 was studied by using DFT calculations. BPh3 promotes the conversion of two substrates (N&#8208;methylaniline and CO2) into a zwitterionic carbamate to give three&#8208;component species [Ph(Me)(H)N+CO2&#8722;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;BPh3]. The carbamate and BPh3 act as the nucleophile and Lewis acid, respectively, for the activation of PhSiH3 to generate [HBPh3]&#8722;, which is used to produce key CO2&#8208;derived species, such as silyl formate and bis(silyl)acetal, essential for the N&#8208;methylation of 1. DFT calculations also suggested other mechanisms involving water for the generation of [HBPh3]&#8722; species.

         <title>Insights into the Effect of the Adsorption Preference of Additives on the Anisotropic Growth of ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolite</title>

Encouraging growth &#8211; more or less: The adsorption preference of eight additives and their role in the anisotropic growth of ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite were investigated experimentally and theoretically. Either an inhibition or a promotion effect is revealed by these additives. A descriptor related to the adsorption energy difference between MFI [100]/[101] and [010] surfaces was employed to estimate the ZSM&#8208;5 morphology, which varied from sphere&#8208;like to plate&#8208;like to noodle&#8208;like.







Abstract
Zeolite morphology plays a crucial role in affecting catalytic performance, while is persistently challenging to tailor through crystal anisotropic growth. It has been recognized that specific additives can be introduced into the synthesis of zeolites to achieve anisotropic growth, however their role and the underlying mechanism are not well understood. Herein, the effect of eight specific additives on the anisotropic growth of the ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite is unveiled within the framework of crystallization engineering. Either an inhibition effect or a promotion effect is revealed for each additive according to the crystallization kinetics. The adsorption preference of typical additives on different surfaces was demonstrated by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) and transmission X&#8208;ray microscopy (TXM) together with 3D reconstruction. The calculated adsorption energy difference between MFI [100]/[101] and [010] surfaces was proposed as a key descriptor to estimate the possible morphology induced by additive. ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites varying from sphere&#8208;like, plate&#8208;like to noodle&#8208;like morphology could be synthesized by employing specific additives with increasing adsorption strength difference on distinct surfaces.

Small stimulus, big change. Vacuum&#8208;induced reversible dissociation of terminal N2&#8208;units lead to structural and electronic reorganisation resulting in a significant activation of a bridging N2 ligand.







Abstract
Nitrogen fixation at iron centres is a fundamental catalytic step for N2 utilisation, relevant to biological (nitrogenase) and industrial (Haber&#8208;Bosch) processes. This step is coupled with important electronic structure changes which are currently poorly understood. We show here for the first time that terminal dinitrogen dissociation from iron complexes that coordinate N2 in a terminal and bridging fashion leaves the Fe&#8208;N2&#8208;Fe unit intact but significantly enhances the degree of N2 activation (&#916;&#957;&#8776;180&#8197;cm&#8722;1, Raman spectroscopy) through charge redistribution. The transformation proceeds with local spin state change at the iron centre (S=
&#8594;S=3/2). Further dissociation of the bridging N2 can be induced under thermolytic conditions, triggering a disproportionation reaction, from which the tetrahedral (PNN)2Fe could be isolated. This work shows that dinitrogen activation can be induced in the absence of external chemical stimuli such as reducing agents or Lewis acids.

17O and 14N are attractive targets for in&#8197;vivo NMR spectroscopy and imaging, but low gyromagnetic ratios and fast spin relaxation complicate their observations. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201490), R.&#8197;P. Martinho and L. Frydman explore indirect ways for detecting these sites with the help of proton detection, amplified by chemical exchanges with the abundant water 1H signal. These amplifications are mediated by spontaneous exchanges that the labile 1Hs bound to 17O or 14N undergo with the water protons, opening new avenues in spectroscopic MRI.

In their Research Article (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202201490"&gt;10.1002/chem.202201490&lt;/a&gt;), R.&#8197;P. Martinho and L. Frydman explore indirect ways for detecting these sites with the help of proton detection, amplified by chemical exchanges with the abundant water &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H signal. These amplifications are mediated by spontaneous exchanges that the labile &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Hs bound to &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O or &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N undergo with the water protons, opening new avenues in spectroscopic MRI.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 58, October 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
BPh3 and PhSiH3, represented as the stars Hikoboshi and Orihime, constitute a powerful catalytic system for deoxygenative CO2 conversions. According to a Japanese legend, this couple were banished to opposite sides of the Milky Way only coming together once a year. When BPh3 and PhSiH3 come together as catalyst and reductant, N&#8208;methylaniline undergoes N&#8208;methylation at room temperature under CO2 and under solvent&#8208;free conditions. The catalytic mechanism was studied by NMR measurements and DFT calculations, both of which strongly suggested the generation of [HBPh3]&#8722; as a key catalytic species. More information can be found in the Research Article by J.&#8208;y. Hasegawa, T. Ema, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202210).

Little sparks burst into mighty flame! The cover picture shows the effect of eight organic additives on the anisotropic growth of a classical ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite at the molecular level. The morphologies, from sphere&#8208;like via plate&#8208;like to noodle&#8208;like, can be obtained by the introduction of additives with increasing adsorption strength difference on three typical surfaces. More information can be found in the Research Article by C. Wang, J. Teng, Z. Xie and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201781).

Perfluoroalkoxylation reactions of heteroaromatic compounds, carbon&#8208;carbon multiple bonds, and substitutions at sp3 carbons with CF3O group can be accomplished by several strategies such as thermal radical methods, photocatalysis, electrolysis, electron transfer and redox neutral radical and nucleophilic processes







Abstract
Direct fluoroalkoxylation reactions of (hetero)arenes, carbon&#8208;carbon multiple bonds, and substitution reactions at Csp3 carbon centers by CF3O, CHF2O, and (CF3)2CFO groups are discussed. Emphasis on thermal radical, electron transfer, photocatalytic, electrochemical and redox&#8208;neutral radical methods are placed to accomplish fluoroalkoxylation reactions. All these methods employ either radical fluoroalkoxylating reagents or some nucleophilic trifluoromethoxylating sources of CF3O. A summary of all these methods is provided in Table&#8197;2.

         <title>Water Triggered Chemical Transformation of Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently emerged lead&#8208;halide perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) are promising optoelectronic material due to their easy solution processability, wide range of color tunability as well as very high photoluminescence quantum yield. Despite their significant success in lab&#8208;scale optoelectronic applications, the long&#8208;term stability becomes the main issue, hindering them towards commercialization. The highly ionic nature of such lead&#8208;halide structure makes them extremely unstable in water and air. However, recently a very few groups have taken the advantage of such nature of the crystal structure for water&#8208;triggered chemical transformation towards shape, composition and morphology controlled stable and bright PNCs which are otherwise difficult to obtain via typical direct approach. Furthermore, using polymer as an encapsulating layer for the PNCs, water soluble stable PNCs have been prepared. In this review, we summarize the recent progress on the water&#8208;hexane interface chemistry towards chemical transformation to produce several PNCs. Such method not only ensure to yield several shape controlled perovskites nanocrystals, but also formation of perovskites in aqueous phase that shows promising application towards bio&#8208;imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Stimulus Response Lanthanide MOF Materials Encapsulated with Viologen Derivatives: Characterization, Photophysical Properties and Sensing on Nitrophenols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Viologens (1,1&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyridyl) possessing electron&#8208;deficient property and redox activity, are a class of suitable chromophores to assemble metal&#8208;organic hybrid photochromic materials. &#160;Viologen&#8208;functionalized metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted much attention for their photochromic properties. &#160;However, the syntheses of lanthanide&#8208;viologen hybrid crystalline photochromic materials remain facing with many challenges, for example, the structures and properties of final products are difficult to predict and are limited by molecular configurations and so on.&#160; In this work, host&#8208;guest composite material Ln&#8208;NH2BDC&#8208;pbpy MOFs are constructed by encapsulating viologen derivative pbpyCl2. &#160;The pbpy2+ moieties is uniformly embed by their &#960;&#8208;&#960; conjugation in the pores of the 3D structure with electrostatic interaction. &#160;Due to the encapsulation of the chromophore pbpy2+ moieties, the Ln&#8208;NH2BDC&#8208;pbpy MOFs exhibit reversible photochromic properties which can change color after irradiation, and can restore the original color after being protected from light or heating. &#160;Interestingly, the fluorescence intensity decreases with illumination time and recovers under dark conditions. &#160;As a result, the Ln&#8208;NH2BDC&#8208;pbpy MOFs have the performance of both photochromic and photomodulated fluorescence. &#160;Based on the outstanding fluorescence performance of the Ln&#8208;NH2BDC&#8208;pbpy MOFs, they also show wonderful detection effect on nitrophenols especially for TNP.</dc:description>

         <title>Overclocking nitronyl nitroxide gold derivatives in cross&#8208;coupling reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitronyl nitroxides are functional building blocks in cutting&#8208;edge research fields, such as the design of molecular magnets, the development of redox and photoswitchable molecular systems and the creation of redox&#8208;active components for organic and hybrid batteries. The key importance of the nitronyl nitroxide function is to translate molecular&#8208;level&#8208;optimized structures into nano&#8208;scale devices and new technologies. In spite of great importance, efficient and versatile synthetic approaches to these compounds still represent a challenge. Particularly, methods for the direct introduction of a nitronyl nitroxide moiety into aromatic systems possess many limitations. Here, we report gold derivatives of nitronyl nitroxide that can enter Pd(0)&#8208;catalysed cross&#8208;coupling reactions with various aryl bromides, affording the corresponding functionalized nitronyl nitroxides. Based on the high thermal stability and enhanced reactivity in catalytic transformation, a new reagent is suggested for the synthesis of radical systems via a universal cross&#8208;coupling approach.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Solvothermal reactions of CoCl2&#8226;6H2O, 3,5&#8208;pyridinedicarboxylic acid (H2L) and isonicotinic acid (HL1)/3&#8208;amino isonicotinic acid (HL2)/3&#8208;chloro isonicotinic acid (HL3) successfully led to three tfz&#8208;d topological pillar&#8208;layer [Co4(&#956;&#8208;F)2(COO)6(NC5H4)4] cluster&#8208;based MOFs, namely, [Co4(&#956;&#8208;F)2(L)2(L1)2&#8226;2DMA]&#8226;DMA&#8226;2H2O (SNNU&#8208;Bai76, SNNU&#8208;Bai = Shaanxi Normal University Bai&#8217;s group), [Co4(&#956;&#8208;F)2(L)2(L2)2&#8226;2H2O]&#8226;2DMA&#8226;2H2O (SNNU&#8208;Bai77) and [Co4(&#956;&#8208;F)2(L)2(L3)2&#8226;2H2O]&#8226;2DMF&#8226;2H2O (SNNU&#8208;Bai78). With 2D pore channels in SNNU&#8208;Bai76 and SNNU&#8208;Bai77 being tuned to the 1D pore channel in SNNU&#8208;Bai78, C3H8 and C2H6 adsorption uptakes are apparently improved and&#160;IAST selectivities of C3H8/CH4 and C2H6/CH4 are almost remained, which indicate that SNNU&#8208;Bai78 may be one potential separation material for the pipeline natural gas purification. These were further confirmed by breakthrough experiments for the simulated pipeline natural gas (C3H8/C2H6/CH4:5/10/85 gas mixture) of three isostructural MOFs. Furthermore, GCMC simulations revealed that due to one of the pore channels blocked by Cl atoms in a couple of 3&#8208;chloro isonicotinic acid with the changed conformation as the pillar, the pore wall of the formed 1D pore channel in SNNU&#8208;Bai78 may interact with the adsorbed C3H8 or C2H6 molecule more strongly, for which more atoms of framework at the new adsorption site will interact with the adsorbed gas molecule by more intermolecular interactions. This was also evidenced by the increased binding energies, being consistent with the tuning of adsorption enthalpies for C3H8 and C2H6 gas molecules, and the reduced C3H8 and C2H6 gas diffusion coefficients in SNNU&#8208;Bai78. Very interestingly, this work is the first example of finely tuning the pore connectivity of MOFs toward strengthened host&#8208;guest interactions for the gas adsorption and separation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>By applying the potassium salts of cyclopentadienyl&#8208;phosphine ligands LK to CoCl 2 , the corresponding cobalt chlorides ( 1 , L Co(II)Cl) were prepared. By reducing complexes 1 with KHBEt 3 under N 2 atmosphere, bridging end&#8208;on complexes, L Co(I)&#8208;N 2 &#8208;Co(I) L ( 2a and 2b ), were obtained successfully. 15 N 2 &#8208;labeled 2a &#8208; 15 N 2 was prepared under 15 N 2 / 14 N 2 exchange in THF solution. L Co(I)&#8208;N 2 &#8208;Co(I) L complex 2a could react with P 4 molecules to release N 2 and generate a&#160;Co&#8208;P 4 &#8208;Co moiety 4 . Further reduction of complex 2b led to cleavage of a P&#8208;C bond in the cyclopentadienyl&#8208;phosphine ligand, while novel &#181; &#8208;PCy 2 bridged Co(0)&#8208;N 2 complex 5 was provided.

         <title>Coordination of Pnictogenylboranes towards Tl(I) salts and a Tl&#8208; mediated P&#8208;P coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The coordination chemistry of only Lewis&#8208;base (LB)stabilized pnictogenylboranes EH2BH2 &#183; NMe 3  (E = P, As) towards Tl(I) salts has been studied. The reaction of Tl[BArCl] (BArCl = [B(3,5C6H3Cl2)4]&#8208;) with the corresponding pnictogenylborane results in the formation of [Tl(EH2BH2&#183;NMe3)][BArCl] (1a: E = P; 1b: E = As). Whereas the Tl ion in 1a/b is monocoordinated, the exchange of the weakly coordinating anion (WCA) in the Tl(I) salt leads to the formation of a trigonal pyramidal coordination mode at the Tl atom by coordination of three equivalents of EH2BH2 &#183; NMe3 in [Tl(EH2BH2 &#183; NMe3)3][WCA] (2a: E = P, WCA = TEFCl; 2b: E = As, WCA = TEF) (TEF = [Al{OC(CF3)3}4]&#8208;, TEFCl = [Al{(OC(CF3)2(CCl3)}4]&#8208;). Furthermore, by using two equivalents of PH2BH2&#183;NMe 3 , a Tl(I)&#8208;mediated P&#8208;P coupling takes place in CH2Cl2 as solvent resulting in [Me3N &#183; BH2PH2PHBH2 &#183; NMe3][WCA] (WCA = TEF, 3a; BArCl, 3b; TEFCl, 3c). In contrast, for the arsenic derivatives 1b and 2b, no coupling reaction is observed. The underlying chemical processes are elucidated by quantum chemical computations.</dc:description>

         <title>New Strategy for Optimizing the Properties of Copper Halide Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Lighting&#8208;emitting Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aiming to developing high&#8208;performance organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid luminescent materials, a new synthesis strategy has been reported, which can systematically design and synthesis copper(I) halide ionic hybrid structures with coordinated anionic coordinated modules, combining the covalent bonding and ionic bonding between inorganic and organic components into one structure, and use their synergistic effect to prepare high&#8208;performance copper(I) halide hybrid luminescent materials.







Abstract
Copper(I) halide organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid luminescent materials have many advantages, such as diverse structure, facile synthesis, high luminescent efficiency, tunable optical performance, etc., and show a broad application prospect in energy&#8208;saving lighting, display and other fields. However, compared with commercial rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal&#8208;based phosphors, the reported hybrids generally suffer from poor stability and low luminescent efficiency, which are the bottleneck problem of their practical application. With the aim of developing high&#8208;performance organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid luminescent materials, a new synthesis strategy has been reported. This strategy can systematically design and synthesis copper(I) halide ionic hybrid structures by combining the covalent bonding and ionic bonding between inorganic and organic components into one structure, and use their synergistic effect to optimizing their properties. This design method is expected to develop high&#8208;performance organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid luminescent materials, promote the in&#8208;depth understanding of this field, and provide new ideas for the optimization of other types of hybrid materials.

         <title>Modeling Type&#8208;1 Iodothyronine Deiodinase with Peptide&#8208;Based Aliphatic Diselenides: Potential Role of Highly Conserved His and Cys Residues as a General Acid Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Type&#8208;1 iodothyronine deiodinase (ID&#8208;1) catalyzes the reductive elimination of 5'&#8208;I and 5&#8208;I on the phenolic and tyrosyl rings of thyroxine (T4), respectively. Chemically verifying whether I atoms with different chemical properties undergo deiodination through a common mechanism is challenging. Herein, we report the modeling of ID&#8208;1 using aliphatic diselenide (Se&#8211;Se) and selenenylsulfide (Se&#8210;S) compounds. Mechanistic investigations of deiodination using the ID&#8208;1&#8208;like reagents suggested that the 5'&#8208;I and 5&#8208;I deiodinations proceed via the same mechanism through an unstable intermediate containing a Se&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;I halogen bond between a selenolate anion, reductively produced from Se&#8210;Se (or Se&#8210;S) in the compound, and an I atom in T4. Moreover, imidazolium and thiol groups, which may act as general acid catalysts, promoted the heterolytic cleavage of the C&#8210;I bond in the Se&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;I intermediate, which is the rate&#8208;determining step, by donating a proton to the C atom.</dc:description>

         <title>Activated Single Phase Ti4O7 Nanosheets with Efficient Utilization of Precious Metal for Inspired Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is central to modern energy storage and conversion technologies for grid such as fuel cells and electrolysers, but challenges remain due to the lack of reliable, economic, and durable electrocatalysts. Here, we develop single crystal conductive black titanium (Ti  4  O  7  ) nanosheets (NSs) as a new precious metal carrier based on sacrificial hard templates and ultrasonic&#8208;assisted peeling, and deposit Pt clusters on the Ti  4  O  7  NSs induced by wetness impregnation under the irradiation of visible light (VI; 650 nm). Pt/Ti  4  O  7  NSs provide Ti  3+  , Pt  2+  , and Pt  0+  continuous active sites for the ORR multi&#8208;electron process, achieving synergy among them. The assistance of visible light not only makes more uniformly and smaller distribution of Pt nanoclusters, but also strengthens the charge transfer, constructing a strong metal&#8208;support interaction interface. VI&#8208;Pt/Ti  4  O  7  NSs show superior initial oxidation potential and mass activity of 1.61 A mg  &#8208;1  Pt  at a E  1/2  = 0.91 V, which is 9 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C. This work provides an effective strategy for achieving high&#8208;value applications of titanium sub&#8208;oxides and further explores the enhanced&#8208;interface in metals&#8208;Ti  n  O  2n&#8208;1  by light radiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Hijacking the Peptidoglycan Recycling Pathway of Escherichia coli to Produce Muropeptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Soluble fragments of peptidoglycan called muropeptides are released from the cell wall of bacteria as part of their metabolism or as a result of biological stresses. These compounds trigger immune responses in mammals and plants. In bacteria, they play a major role in the induction of antibiotic resistance. The development of efficient methods to produce muropeptides is therefore desirable both to address their mechanism of action and to design new antibacterial and immunostimulant agents. Here, we engineered the peptidoglycan recycling pathway of Escherichia coli to produce N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;glucosaminyl&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;1,6&#8208;anhydro&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;muramic acid (GlcNAc&#8208;anhMurNAc), a common precursor of Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive muropeptides. Inactivation of the hexosaminidase nagZ gene allowed the efficient production of this key disaccharide, providing access to Gram&#8208;positive muropeptides through subsequent chemical peptide conjugation. E. coli strains deficient in both NagZ hexosaminidase and amidase activities further enabled the in vivo production of Gram&#8208;negative muropeptides containing meso&#8208;diaminopimelic acid, a rarely available amino acid.</dc:description>

         <title>A Small&#8208;Molecule Probe with a Dual Function of miRNA Inhibition and Target identification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By virtue of their key roles in&#160;pathologies,&#160;miRNAs&#160;represent a promising class of therapeutic targets.&#160;While high&#8208;fidelity small&#8208;molecule modulators of miRNAs can be identified&#160;via&#160;high&#8208;throughput screening using cellular reporter systems, their modes of action are elusive due to the lack of proper tools. Here, we report a small&#8208;molecule probe, 1a, that is capable of elucidating its biological target along miRNA inhibition. Derived from norathyriol, a nature product, 1a possessed a bioorthogonal alkyne moiety for subsequent labeling&#160;via&#160;copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition chemistry. We demonstrated that 1a inhibited a panel of different miRNAs by blocking their loading onto argonaute 2 (AGO2), which is the key protein responsible for miRNA function. With the alkyne handle, we successfully identified AGO2 as an intracellular target of 1a. Therefore, this work presents a novel small&#8208;molecule tool for suppressing and probing miRNA regulatory pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Auxiliary&#8208;Mediated Native Chemical Ligation at Challenging Junctions with Pyridine Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A properly positioned pyridine ring can speed up auxiliary&#8208;mediated native chemical ligation. A methoxy substituent increases auxiliary stability and facilitates rapid syntheses of long and multiphosphorylated multirepeat proteins and of head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclized peptides.







Abstract
To expand the scope of native chemical ligation (NCL) beyond reactions at cysteine, ligation auxiliaries are appended to the peptide N&#8208;terminus. After the introduction of a pyridine&#8208;containing auxiliary, which provided access to challenging junctions (proline or &#946;&#8208;branched amino acids), we herein probe the role of the pyridine&#8208;ring nitrogen. We observed side reactions leading to preliminary auxiliary loss. We describe a new easy to attach &#946;&#8208;mercapto&#8208;&#946;&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxy&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinyl)&#8208;ethyl (MMPyE) auxiliary, which 1) has increased stability; 2) enables NCL at sterically encumbered junctions (e.&#8201;g., Leu&#8208;Val); and 3) allows removal under mildly basic (pH&#8197;8.5) conditions was introduced. The synthesis of a 120 aa long peptide containing eight MUC5AC tandem repeats via ligation of two 60mers demonstrates the usefulness. Making use of hitherto unexplored NCL to tyrosine, the MMPyE auxiliary provided access to a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail&#8208;cyclized 21&#8208;mer peptide and a His6&#8208;tagged hexaphosphorylated peptide comprising 6 heptapeptide repeats of the RNA polymerase II C&#8208;terminal domain.

         <title>Analysis of the Magnetic Coupling in a Mn(II)&#8208;U(V)&#8208;Mn(II) Single Molecule Magnet</title>

Magnetization barrier in a {3&#8201;d&#8208;5&#8201;f&#8208;3&#8201;d} trimeric complex. The anisotropic magnetic properties of a {Mn(II)&#8208;U(V)&#8208;Mn(II)} SMM are modelled using ab initio calculations and Spin Hamiltonians.The magnetic coupling is strongly anisotropic and leads to the magnetization barrier.







Abstract
[{Mn(TPA)I}{UO2(Mesaldien)}{Mn(TPA)I}]I formula (here TPA=tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine and Mesaldien=N,N&#8217;&#8208;(2&#8208;aminomethyl)diethylenebis(salicylidene imine)) reported by Mazzanti and coworkers (Chatelain et&#8197;al. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2014, 53, 13434) is so far the best Single Molecule Magnet (SMM) in the {3d&#8211;5f} class of molecules exhibiting barrier height of magnetization reversal as high as 81.0&#8197;K. In this work, we have employed a combination of ab initio CAS and DFT methods to fully characterize this compound and to extract the relevant spin Hamiltonian parameters. We show that the signs of the magnetic coupling and of the g&#8208;factors of the monomers are interconnected. The central magnetic unit [UVO2]+ is described by a Kramers Doublet (KD) with negative g&#8208;factors, due to a large orbital contribution. The magnetic coupling for the {Mn(II)&#8208;U(V)} pair is modeled by an anisotropic exchange Hamiltonian: all components are ferromagnetic in terms of spin moments, the parallel component JZ twice larger as the perpendicular one J&#8869;. The spin density distribution suggests that spin polarization on the U(V) center favors the ferromagnetic coupling. Further, the JZ/J&#8869; ratio, which is related to the barrier height, was found to correlate to the corresponding spin contribution of the g&#8208;factors of the U(V) center. This correlation established for the first time offers a direct way to estimate this important ratio from the corresponding gS&#8208;values, which can be obtained using traditional ab initio packages and hence has a wider application to other {3d&#8211;5f} magnets. It is finally shown that the magnetization barrier height is tuned by the splitting of the [UVO2]+ 5&#8201;f orbitals.

Stereocontrol: We have studied the enantioselective transannular aminohalogenation of unsaturated medium&#8208;sized cyclic benzosulfonamides by using both chiral Br&#248;nsted acid and phase&#8208;transfer catalysis. The mechanism of the reaction was also studied by using computational tools; we observed that the key step for stereocontrol involves the participation of an interconverting planar chiral conformer of the nine&#8208;membered cyclic starting material







Abstract
We have studied the enantioselective transannular aminohalogenation reaction of unsaturated medium&#8208;sized cyclic benzosulfonamides by using both chiral Br&#248;nsted acid and phase&#8208;transfer catalysis. Under optimized conditions, a variety of bicyclic adducts can be obtained with good yields and high enantioselectivities. The mechanism of the reaction was also studied by using computational tools; we observed that the reaction involves the participation of a conformer of the nine&#8208;membered cyclic substrate with planar chirality in which the stereochemical outcome is controlled by the relative reactivity of the two pseudorotational enantiomers when interacting with the chiral catalyst.

         <title>Chemical Strategies for Dendritic Magneto&#8208;plasmonic Nanostructures Applied to Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dendritic nanoarchitectures allow myriads of chemical strategies for designing hybrid multifunctional materials containing magnetic and plasmonic nanoparticles. Poly(amidoamine) dendrimers are explored in a series of magneto&#8208;plasmonic substrates for surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) detection of a pesticide dissolved in water. The Fe3O4 particles assist the magnetic separation of the dendritic sorbents from aqueous samples for subsequent SERS analysis of molecular adsorbates on gold.

         <title>Revealing Phosphorus Nitrides up to the Megabar Regime: Synthesis of &#945;&#8242;&#8208;P3N5, &#948;&#8208;P3N5 and PN2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phase in, phase out: Investigations of the phosphorus&#8211;nitrogen system in a laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cell resulted in the synthesis of new &#948;&#8208;P3N5 and PN2 phases at 72 and 134&#8197;GPa, respectively. Their structures are composed of PN6 octahedra. Upon decompression, &#948;&#8208;P3N5 transforms into the novel &#945;&#8242;&#8208;P3N5 solid that is stable under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Non&#8208;metal nitrides are an exciting field of chemistry, featuring a significant number of compounds that can possess outstanding material properties. These properties mainly rely on maximizing the number of strong covalent bonds, with crosslinked XN6 octahedra frameworks being particularly attractive. In this study, the phosphorus&#8211;nitrogen system was studied up to 137&#8197;GPa in laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cells, and three previously unobserved phases were synthesized and characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy measurements and density functional theory calculations. &#948;&#8208;P3N5 and PN2 were found to form at 72 and 134&#8197;GPa, respectively, and both feature dense 3D networks of the so far elusive PN6 units. The two compounds are ultra&#8208;incompressible, having a bulk modulus of K0=322&#8197;GPa for &#948;&#8208;P3N5 and 339&#8197;GPa for PN2. Upon decompression below 7&#8197;GPa, &#948;&#8208;P3N5 undergoes a transformation into a novel &#945;&#8242;&#8208;P3N5 solid, stable at ambient conditions, that has a unique structure type based on PN4 tetrahedra. The formation of &#945;&#8242;&#8208;P3N5 underlines that a phase space otherwise inaccessible can be explored through materials formed under high pressure.

         <title>A Photochemical Macrocyclization Route to Asymmetric Strained [3.2] Paracyclophanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel synthetic route to strained cyclophanes is reported, which involves the unexpected photochemical fusion of a carboxylic ester and a non&#8208;activated methyl group. Functional experiments suggest that the previously overlooked C&#8722;C bond forming reaction involves an excited triplet state and intramolecular hydrogen abstraction. Using a flow reactor, a series of otherwise difficult&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize cyclophanes with different substitution patterns were prepared







Abstract
The intricate frameworks of paracyclophanes are an important target for synthesis since they are found in various chiral auxiliaries, solar cells, high&#8208;performance plastics, pharmaceuticals, and molecular machines. Whereas numerous methods exist for the preparation of symmetric paracyclophanes, protocols for the efficient synthesis of strained asymmetric scaffolds are limited. Here we report a remarkably simple photochemical route to strained [3.2]paracyclophanes starting from readily available educts. By way of NMR and X&#8208;ray analyses, we discovered that UV&#8208;irradiation of an aromatic carboxylic ester tethered to a toluene moiety leads to the intramolecular formation of a new C&#8722;C bond, with loss of an alcohol. A systematic evaluation of the reaction conditions and substituents, as well as radical starter and triplet quenching experiments, point to a reaction mechanism involving an excited triplet state and hydrogen atom transfer. The new method proved to be robust and versatile enabling the synthesis of a range of cyclophanes with different substitutions, including an unusual diastereoisomer with two planar chiral centers, and thus proved to be a valuable addition to the synthetic toolbox.

Eu&#8208;ETTB and Gd&#8208;ETTB were obtained by self&#8208;assembly; their three&#8208;dimensional frameworks provide a channel for proton conduction. Under high humidity, water molecules are adsorbed in the channel and form complex hydrogen bond networks, shown as lightning. Astronauts moving easily along the channel represent the effective transport of protons: proton conductivity reached a maximum value of 2.63&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1.

         <title>E&#8208;selective Semi&#8208;hydrogenation of Alkynes under Mild Conditions by a Diruthenium Hydride Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two do the job: Diruthenium hydrido carbonyl complexes bound to a PNNP expanded pincer ligand are described. Deprotonation of the methylene linkers enables cooperative activation of H2 allowing for the E&#8208;selective semi&#8208;hydrogenation of internal alkynes under mild conditions. Initial insights into the mechanism and the isolation of a deactivated species with an unusual structure are provided.







Abstract
The synthesis, characterization and catalytic activity of a new class of diruthenium hydrido carbonyl complexes bound to the tBuPNNP expanded pincer ligand is described. Reacting tBuPNNP with two equiv of RuHCl(PPh3)3(CO) at 140&#8201;&#176;C produces an insoluble air&#8208;stable complex, which was structurally characterized as [Ru2(tBuPNNP)H(&#956;&#8208;H)Cl(&#956;&#8208;Cl)(CO)2] (1) using solid&#8208;state NMR, IR and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopies and follow&#8208;up reactivity. A reaction with KOtBu results in deprotonation of a methylene linker to produce [Ru2(tBuPNNP*)H(&#956;&#8208;H)(&#956;&#8208;OtBu)(CO)2] (3) featuring a partially dearomatized naphthyridine core. This enables metal&#8208;ligand cooperative activation of H2 analogous to the mononuclear analogue, [Ru(tBuPNP*)H(CO)]. In contrast to the mononuclear system, the bimetallic analogue 3 catalyzes the E&#8208;selective semi&#8208;hydrogenation of alkynes at ambient temperature and atmospheric H2 pressure with good functional group tolerance. Monitoring the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of diphenylacetylene by 1H NMR spectroscopy shows the intermediacy of Z&#8208;stilbene, which is subsequently isomerized to the E&#8208;isomer. Initial findings into the mode of action of this system are provided, including the spectroscopic characterization of a polyhydride intermediate and the isolation of a deactivated species with a partially hydrogenated naphthyridine backbone.

         <title>Towards Substrate&#8211;Reagent Interaction of Lochmann&#8211;Schlosser Bases in THF: Bridging THF Hides Potential Reaction Site of a Chiral Superbase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isolation of a new THF&#8208;solvated, ferrocene&#8208;based Lochmann&#8211;Schlosser base with all four components lithium, potassium, carbanion, and alkoxide led to the observation of new structural motifs with respect to these superbasic reagents. The &#8220;kick out&#8221; of a THF leads to the detachment, providing the typical Li/K reaction site, whereas the &#8220;smart pass&#8221; leads to the favorable THF&#8208;displacement and the K/K reaction site provided for substrates.







Abstract
The metalation of N,N&#8208;dimethylaminomethylferrocene in THF by the superbasic mixture of nBuLi/KOtBu proceeds readily at low temperatures to afford a bimetallic Li2K2 aggregate containing ferrocenyl anions and tert&#8208;butoxide. Starting from an enantiomerically enriched ortho&#8208;lithiated aminomethylferrocene, an enantiomerically pure superbase can be prepared. The molecular compound exhibits superbasic behavior deprotonating N,N&#8208;dimethylbenzylamine in the &#945;&#8208;position and is also capable of deprotonating toluene. Quantum chemical calculations provide insight into the role of the bridging THF molecule to the possible substrate&#8211;reagent interaction. In addition, a benzylpotassium alkoxide adduct gives a closer look into the corresponding reaction site of the Lochmann&#8211;Schlosser base that is reported herein.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Linker Containing Detergents for Membrane Protein Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
T&#8208;DDMs for membrane proteins: A series of &#8220;hydrophobicity&#8208;neutral&#8221; linkers were incorporated between the hydrophobic tail and hydrophilic maltose of the traditional detergent DDM. This remodeling strategy yielded T&#8208;DDMs, among which superior detergents with excellent physical properties and stabilization capability were identified, as illustrated in the NMR study of A2AAR.







Abstract
It is a pressing need, but still challenging to explore the structure and function of membrane proteins (MPs). One of the main obstacles is the limited availability of matched detergents for the handling of specific MPs. We describe herein the design of new detergents by incorporation of a transition linker between the hydrophilic head and the hydrophobic tail. This design allows a gradual change of hydrophobicity between the outside and inside of micelles, in contrast to the abrupt switch in conventional detergents. Notably, many of these detergents assembled into micelles in while retaining low critical micelle concentrations. Meanwhile, thermal stabilizing evaluation identified superior detergents for representative MPs, including G&#8197;protein&#8208;coupled receptors and a transporter protein. Among them, further improved the NMR study of MPs. We anticipate these that results will encourage future detergent expansion through new remodeling on the traditional detergent scaffold.

         <title>Dynamic Interactions between Brilliant Green and MscL Investigated by Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy and Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mechanosensitive ion channel of large conductance (MscL) is a promising template for the development of new antibiotics due to its high conservation and uniqueness to microbes. Brilliant green (BG), a triarylmethane dye, has been identified as a new antibiotic targeting MscL. However, the detailed binding sites of BG to MscL and the dynamic pathway of BG through the MscL channel remain unknown. Here, we investigated the dynamic interactions between BG and MscL using solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and molecule dynamics (MD) simulations. We identified residue site&#8208;specific binding sites of BG to the MscL channel by solid&#8208;state NMR. In addition, MD simulations revealed that BG conducts through the MscL channel via residues along the inner surface of the pore sequentially, in which the strong hydrophobic interactions between BG and hydrophobic residues F23 and I27 in the hydrophobic gate region of the MscL channel are major restrictions. Particularly, we demonstrated that BG activates the MscL channel by reducing the hydrophobicity of the F23 in the gate region by water molecules that are bound to BG. Taken together, these simulations and experimental data provide novel insights into the dynamic interactions between BG and MscL, based on which we can develop new hydrophobic antibiotics and adjuvants targeting MscL.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial C&#8722;S bonds of g&#8208;C3N4/Bi19Br3S27 S&#8208;scheme heterojunction for enhanced photocatalytic CO2 reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Step&#8208;scheme (S&#8208;scheme) heterojunctions have been extensively studied in photocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction due to their excellent charge separation and high redox ability. The built&#8208;in electric field at the interface of S&#8208;scheme heterojunction serves as the driving force for charge transfer, however, the poor interfacial contact greatly restricts the carrier migration rate. Herein, we synthesized g&#8208;C3N4/Bi19Br3S27 S&#8208;scheme heterostructure through in&#8208;situ deposition of Bi19Br3S27 (BBS) on porous g&#8208;C3N4 (P&#8208;CN) nanosheets. The C&#8722;S bonds formed at the interface help to enhance the built&#8208;in electric field, thereby promoting the charge transfer and separation. As a result, the CO2 reduction reaction performance of 10%Bi19Br3S27/g&#8208;C3N4 (BBS/P&#8208;CN) reaches 32.78 &#956;mol g&#8722;1h&#8722;1, which is 341.4 and 18.7 times higher than that of pure BBS and P&#8208;CN, respectively. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT&#8208;IR) prove the presence of chemical bonds (C&#8722;S) between the P&#8208;CN and BBS. The S&#8208;scheme charge transfer mechanism was analyzed via XPS and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work provides a new idea for designing heterojunction photocatalysts with interfacial chemical bonds to achieve high charge transfer and catalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Roundabout of Four&#8208;Point&#8208;Star Tiles with the Core Arm Length of Three Half&#8208;Turns for 2D DNA Arrays</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By rationally adjusting the weaving modes of point&#8208;star tiles, the curvature inherent in the tiles can be changed, and various DNA nanostructures can be assembled, such as planar wireframe meshes, perforated wireframe tubes, and curved wireframe polyhedra. Based on the weaving and tiling architectures for traditional point&#8208;star tiles with the core arm length at two DNA half&#8208;turns, we improved the weaving modes of our newly reported four&#8208;point&#8208;star tiles with the core arm length at three half&#8208;turns to adjust their curvature and rigidity for assembling 2D arrays of DNA grids and tubes. Following our previous terms and methods to analyze the structural details of E&#8208;tiling tubes, we used the chiral indices (n,m) to describe the most abundant tube of typical assemblies; especially, we applied both one&#8208;locus and/or dual&#8208;locus biotin/streptavidin (SA) labeling strategies to define the configurations of two specific tubes, along with the absolute conformations of their component tiles. Such structural details of the DNA tubes composed of tiles with addressable concave and convex faces and packing directions should help us understand their physio&#8208;chemical and biological properties, and therefore promote their applications in drug delivery, biocatalysis, biomedicine, etc.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;By rationally adjusting the weaving modes of point-star tiles, the curvature inherent in the tiles can be changed, and various DNA nanostructures can be assembled, such as planar wireframe meshes, perforated wireframe tubes, and curved wireframe polyhedra. Based on the weaving and tiling architectures for traditional point-star tiles with the core arm length at two DNA half-turns, we improved the weaving modes of our newly reported four-point-star tiles with the core arm length at three half-turns to adjust their curvature and rigidity for assembling 2D arrays of DNA grids and tubes. Following our previous terms and methods to analyze the structural details of E-tiling tubes, we used the chiral indices (n,m) to describe the most abundant tube of typical assemblies; especially, we applied both one-locus and/or dual-locus biotin/streptavidin (SA) labeling strategies to define the configurations of two specific tubes, along with the absolute conformations of their component tiles.

         <title>Orthogonal Crosslinking: A Strategy to Generate Novel Protein Topology and Function</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compared to the disulfide bond, other naturally occurring intramolecular crosslinks have received little attention, presumably due to their rarity in vast protein space. Here we presented examples of natural non&#8208;disulfide crosslinks, which we refer to as orthogonal crosslinks, emphasizing their effect on protein topology and function. We summarized recent efforts on expanding orthogonal crosslinks using either the enzymes that catalyze protein circularization or the genetic code expansion strategy to add electrophilic amino acids site&#8208;specifically in proteins. The advantages and disadvantages of each method were discussed, along with their applications to generate novel protein topology and function. In particular, we highlighted our recent work on spontaneous orthogonal crosslinking, in which a carbamate&#8208;based crosslink was generated in situ, and its applications in designing orthogonally crosslinked domain antibodies with their topology mimicking bacterial adhesins.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbonyl&#8208;containing derivatives show enduring vitality in the field of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials, which can realize high device efficiency by utilizing both singlet and triplet excitons for electroluminescence. And recently, the based on fused ketone/amine system exhibited huge potential for constructing multi resonance TADF (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters, which exhibit higher superiority for narrowband emission compared with conventional TADF emitters with twisted donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) structure. Herein, we summarized the current research progress of both traditional and MR types ketone derivatives with TADF characteristics for introducing the involved molecular design strategy of holding high&#8208;device efficiency and keeping narrowband emission profile simultaneously. We hope this review can inspire the emergence of more high&#8208;performance narrowband materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Advanced Covalent Organic Frameworks for Multi Valent Metal Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have received increased interest in recent years as an advanced class of materials. By virtue of the available monomers, multiple conformations and various linkages, COFs offer a wide range of opportunities for complex structural design and specific functional development of materials, which has facilitated the widespread application in many fields, including multi valent metal ion batteries (MVMIBs), described as the attractive candidate replacing lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). With their robust skeletons, diverse pores, flexible structures and abundant functional groups, COFs are expected to help realize a high performance MVMIBs. In this review, we present an overview of COFs, describe advances in topology design and synthetic reactions, and study the application of COFs in MVMIBs, as well as discuss challenges and solutions in the preparation of COFs electrodes, in the hope of providing constructive insights into the future direction of COFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Photocatalytic Performance of Ruthenium (II) Polypyridine Complexes Via Ligand Modification for Visible&#8208;Light Induced Phosphorylation of Tertiary Aliphatic Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tuning the redox potential of commonly available photocatalyst to improve the catalytic performance or expand its scope for challenging synthetic conversions is an ongoing demand in synthetic chemistry. Herein, we tuned the excited state properties and redox potential of commercially available [Ru(bpy)3]2+ photocatalyst by modifying the structure of the bipyridine ligands with electron&#8208;donating/withdrawing units. We demonstrate the visible light&#8208;mediated photoredox phosphorylation of tertiary aliphatic amines under mild conditions. A series of cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reactions were performed employing the RuII complexes as photocatalyst yielding the corresponding &#945;&#8208;aminophosphinoxides and &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonates via C&#8722;P bond formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Interactive Bioconjugation at N&#8208;terminal Cysteines using O&#8209;Salicylaldehyde Esters towards dual site&#8208;selective functionalization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;terminal Cys modification has been intensively studied to produce homogeneous bioconjugates essentially through two modes of reaction: reversible modification with the equilibrium shifted towards the formation of the desired conjugate or stable and irreversible conjugates. Herein, we report a new method of N&#8208;terminal cysteine modification using O&#8208;Salicylaldehyde Esters (OSAEs) through fast conjugation and irreversible deconjugation. These reagents can rapidly react with N&#8208;terminal Cys at low micromolar concentration to form thiazolidines with consequent hydrolysis of the ester moiety into the phenolic derivative. These phenolic thiazolidines can be hydrolyzed under acidic pH (&#8776;4.5) to recover the intact N&#8208;terminal Cys. Bioconjugation reactions using OSAEs offer controlled reversibility to as act as a protecting group for N&#8208;terminal cysteines, allowing the modification of in&#8208;chain residues without perturbing the N&#8208;terminal Cys which can then be deprotected and used as a conjugation site</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Borylation of Propargylic Acetates for the Synthesis of Multisubstituted Allenylboronates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel iron&#8208;catalyzed borylation of propargylic acetates leading to allenylboronates was developed. The method allows preparation of a variety of di&#8208;, tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted allenylboronates at room temperature with good functional group compatibility. Stereo&#173;chemical studies show that an anti&#8208;SN2&#8217; displacement of acetate by boron occurs, which also allows chirality transfer to yield enantiomerically enriched allenyl&#173;boronates. The synthetic utility of this protocol is further substantiated by transformations of the obtained allenylboronates including oxidation and propargylation.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidative Desymmetrization Enables the Concise Synthesis of a trans&#8208;Cyclooctene Linker for Bioorthogonal Bond&#8208;Cleavage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modified trans&#8208;cyclooctenes (TCO) are capable of highly efficient molecular manipulations in biological environments, driven by the bioorthogonal reaction with tetrazines (Tz). The development of click&#8208;cleavable TCO has fueled the field of in vivo chemistry and enabled the design of therapeutic strategies that have already started to enter the clinic. A key element for most of these approaches is the implementation of a cleavable TCO linker. So far, only one member of this class has been developed, a compound that requires a high synthetic effort, mainly to fulfill the multi&#8208;layered demands on its chemical structure. To tackle this limitation, we developed a dioxolane&#8208;fused cleavable TCO linker (dcTCO) that can be prepared in only 5 steps, applying an oxidative desymmetrization to achieve diastereoselective introduction of the required functionalities. Based on investigation of the structure, reaction kinetics, stability, and hydrophilicity of dcTCO, we demonstrate its bioorthogonal application in the design of a caged prodrug that can be activated via in situ Tz&#8208;triggered cleavage to achieve a remarkable &gt;1000&#8208;fold increase in cytotoxicity.</dc:description>

The development of click-cleavable TCO has fueled the field of in vivo chemistry and enabled the design of therapeutic strategies that have already started to enter the clinic. A key element for most of these approaches is the implementation of a cleavable TCO linker. So far, only one member of this class has been developed, a compound that requires a high synthetic effort, mainly to fulfill the multi-layered demands on its chemical structure. To tackle this limitation, we developed a dioxolane-fused cleavable TCO linker (dcTCO) that can be prepared in only 5 steps, applying an oxidative desymmetrization to achieve diastereoselective introduction of the required functionalities. Based on investigation of the structure, reaction kinetics, stability, and hydrophilicity of dcTCO, we demonstrate its bioorthogonal application in the design of a caged prodrug that can be activated via in situ Tz-triggered cleavage to achieve a remarkable &amp;gt;1000-fold increase in cytotoxicity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Shining a Light on Photoresponsive Type III Porous Liquids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous materials are the subject of extensive research because of potential applications in areas such as gas adsorption and molecular separations. Until recently, most porous materials were solids, but there is now an emerging class of materials known as porous liquids. The incorporation of intrinsic porosity or cavities in a liquid can result in free&#8208;flowing materials that are capable of gas uptakes that are significantly higher than conventional non&#8208;porous liquids. A handful of porous liquids have also been investigated for gas separations. Until now, the release of gas from porous liquids has relied on molecular displacement (e.g., by adding small solvent molecules), pressure or temperature swings, or sonication. Here, we explore a new method of gas release that involves photoisomerisable porous liquids comprising a photoresponsive MOF dispersed in an ionic liquid. This results in the selective uptake of CO  2  over CH  4  , and allows gas release to be controlled by using UV light.</dc:description>

         <title>A Potent Auto&#8208;Umpolung Ligand for Conjugative Radical Stabilization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbenes with conjugatively connected redox system act as &#8220;auto&#8208;umpolung&#8221; ligands. Due to their electronic flexibility, they should also be particularly suitable to stabilize open&#8208;shell species Herein, the first neutral radical of such sort is described in form of a dialkylamino&#8208;substituted bis(dicyanomethylen)cyclopropanide. Despite the absence of steric shielding, the radical is stable for an extended amount of time and was consequently characterized in solution via EPR measurements. These data and accompanying X&#8208;ray structural analyses indicate that the radical species is in equilibrium with aggregates (formed via &#960;&#8208;stacking) and dimers (obtained via &#963;&#8208;bond formation between methylene carbons).</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A three&#8208;component reaction of  N, N  &#8208;disubstituted aniline, &#945;&#8208;diazo ester, and an allylic electrophile has been realized by [Rh(II)]  2  /Xantphos catalysis, providing a direct access to various aniline derivatives bearing diaryl allylic quaternary centers in good yields. The synthetic utility of this protocol was demonstrated by facile derivatization of the products for preparation of biologically relevant molecules and structural scaffolds, which offers a high potential for increasing the molecular diversity. Mechanistic studies identified &#945;, &#945;&#8208;diarylacetate species as an active intermediate, thereby revealing the presence of a C(  sp  2  )&#8208;H functionalization of aniline derivatives/allylic alkylation cascade in this attractive catalytic transformation.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Dielectric Relaxation and Dielectric Switching Behaviors in (N,N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine) Tetrachloroantimonate(III)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dielectric switches have drawn renewed attention to the study of their many potential applications with the adjustable switch temperatures (  T  s  ). Herein, a novel antimony&#8208;based halide semiconductor, (  N  ,  N  &#8208;diisopropylethylamine) tetrachloroantimonate (  (DIPEA)SbCl  4  , DIPEA  +  =  N  ,  N  &#8208;diisopropylethylamine), with dielectric relaxation behavior and dielectric switches has been successfully synthesized. This compound consisted of the coordinated anion  [[EQUATION]]  chains and isolated DIPEA  +  cations undergoes an isostructural order&#8208;disorder phase transition and shows a step&#8208;like dielectric anomaly, which can function as a frequency&#8208;tuned dielectric switch with highly adjustable switch temperature (  T  s  ). The variable&#8208;temperature single&#8208;crystal structure analyses and first&#8208;principles molecular dynamics simulations give the information about the general mechanisms of molecular dynamics.

Herein, a novel antimony-based halide semiconductor, (  N  ,  N  -diisopropylethylamine) tetrachloroantimonate (  (DIPEA)SbCl  4  , DIPEA  +  =  N  ,  N  -diisopropylethylamine), with dielectric relaxation behavior and dielectric switches has been successfully synthesized. This compound consisted of the coordinated anion  [[EQUATION]]  chains and isolated DIPEA  +  cations undergoes an isostructural order-disorder phase transition and shows a step-like dielectric anomaly, which can function as a frequency-tuned dielectric switch with highly adjustable switch temperature (  T  s  ). The variable-temperature single-crystal structure analyses and first-principles molecular dynamics simulations give the information about the general mechanisms of molecular dynamics. This work enriches the dielectric switch family, and proves that hybrid metal halides are promising candidates for the switchable physical or chemical properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unprecedented Combination of Polyketide Natural Product Fragments Identifies the New Hedgehog Signaling Pathway Inhibitor Grismonone</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical evolution of polyketide natural products leads to the unprecedented combination of biosynthetically related fragments in arrangements not found in Nature. The pseudo&#8208;natural product grismonone was identified to be a potent inhibitor of Hedgehog signaling &#8211; a bioactivity that is not shared by its guiding fragments.







Abstract
Pseudo&#8208;natural products (pseudo&#8208;NPs) are de novo combinations of natural product (NP) fragments that define novel bioactive chemotypes. For their discovery, new design principles are being sought. Previously, pseudo&#8208;NPs were synthesized by the combination of fragments originating from biosynthetically unrelated NPs to guarantee structural novelty and novel bioactivity. We report the combination of fragments from biosynthetically related NPs in novel arrangements to yield a novel chemotype with activity not shared by the guiding fragments. We describe the synthesis of the polyketide pseudo&#8208;NP grismonone and identify it as a structurally novel and potent inhibitor of Hedgehog signaling. The insight that the de novo combination of fragments derived from biosynthetically related NPs may also yield new biologically relevant compound classes with unexpected bioactivity may be considered a chemical extension or diversion of existing biosynthetic pathways and greatly expands the opportunities for exploration of biologically relevant chemical space by means of the pseudo&#8208;NP principle.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade Reaction in Water to Imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridazines as Switchable DSEgens, AIEgens, and ACQgens
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8208;promoted Pd&#8208;catalyzed cascade reactions realized the discovery of DSEgens with switchable capacity to AIEgens and ACQgens under mild reaction conditions. (DSE=dual&#8208;state emission, AIE=aggregation&#8208;induced emissions, ACQ=aggregation&#8208;caused quenching).







Abstract
Dual&#8208;state emission (DSE) luminophores exhibit strong emissions in both solution and solid states, filling the gaps between aggregation&#8208;induced emissions (AIE) and aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ). However, limited design concepts and complicated synthetic strategies restrict the discovery of novel DSE molecules. Developing efficient and green methodologies to access novel DSE scaffolds via rational design remains highly desirable. In this work, we report a water&#8208;promoted Pd&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction for the synthesis of multi&#8208;substituted imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridazine derivatives with DSE properties. The intramolecular interactions of the neighboring benzene rings restrict molecular motion, leading to emissions in the solid state (quantum yield: 11&#8201;%), and the newly constructed core structure of imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridazine ensures considerable planarity, allowing for emissions in solution. Further removal of the neighboring phenyl groups resulted in ACQgens, while additional methyl groups led to AIEgens. Subsequent live cell imaging investigations suggested that the novel DSEgens could serve as specific lipid droplet (LD) probes in a wide concentration range.

         <title>Chemoselective Coupling of &#960;&#8208;Systems to Access Metallated 1,4&#8208; or 1,5&#8208;Skipped Dienes in Multicomponent Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Assembling metallated skipped dienes employing C&#8722;C &#960; systems in intermolecular fashion requires the chemoselective activation of either of the components by transition metals. In this Concept article, a clear picture of advancements in the synthesis of skipped dienes decorated with metallic groups (boron and silicon) is described. In addition, recent discoveries are highlighted in depth, emphasizing mechanistic studies, where paradigm shifts resulting from the substrate&#8208;chelation can be anticipated.







Abstract
Integrating distinct unsaturated C&#8722;C systems while simultaneously installing metallic groups has been significantly challenging to execute in a multicomponent reaction. Therefore, designing a suitable mechanistic pathway that provides the required reactivity and selectivity for target C&#8722;C bonds with metallic reagents to ensure successful coupling is the key to success. Copper&#8208;catalyzed borylallylation and silylallylation have emerged as the most efficient strategies for assembling borylated/silylated skipped (1,4 or 1,5) dienes by catalytically combining an organocopper intermediate with allyl electrophiles. However, reactions involving interelemental reagents (e.&#8201;g., [Si]&#8722;[B]) to accomplish intermolecular atom&#8208;economic couplings have not been studied thoroughly. Therefore, to aid the development of new transformations in this research area, this article attempts to include all precedents, including recent studies by the authors. The present Concept article may be helpful for researchers working in this area as it provides a basic conceptual framework.

Three kinds of chiral cyclic compounds and their mirror&#8208;image isomers are described. The cover was created by using a &#8220;kaleidoscope&#8221; motif to project the three pairs of enantiomers in the central hexagon. The kaleidoscope is an optical device invented in the 19th century as a result of experiments on polarized light; the word &#8220;kaleidoscope&#8221;, derived from the Greek kalos &#8220;beautiful&#8221;, was used to represent the beautiful and circularly polarized luminescent (CPL) molecules. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Hasegawa, Y. Mazaki, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202218).

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Emission and Aggregate Emission of Aroyl&#8208; S,N&#8208;Ketene Acetals Are Controlled and Tuned by Their Substitution Pattern</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By expanding the library of aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals to 111 examples, it was possible to fully control their photophysical properties &#8211; ranging from emission color to quantum yield &#8211; in the solid and aggregated states. Thorough analysis then allowed all aspects of these properties to be tuned.







Abstract
Aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals are a novel highly diverse class of aggregation&#8208;induced emission fluorogens (AIEgens) with a plethora of interesting properties. An expanded compound library of more than 110 dyes set the stage for the first qualitative control and tuneability of all aspects of their photophysical properties. The interplay of substituents not only allows tuning and prediction of the emission color, but also of the intensity, and quantum yields both in solids and in the aggregated state; these can be rationalized by scrutinizing intermolecular interactions in the crystalline solid state.

         <title>Differential Tunneling&#8208;Driven and Vibrationally&#8208;Induced Reactivity in Isomeric Benzazirines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum tunneling and IR vibrational excitation chemistry was discovered to manifest differently in two isomeric benzazirines generated in cryogenic matrices. Computations show that these reactive intermediates have distinct energy profiles regarding two competitive bond&#8208;breaking/bond&#8208;forming pathways. These exceptional results allow probing into the fundamental nature of such unconventional types of chemical reactivity.







Abstract
Quantum mechanical tunneling of heavy&#8208;atoms and vibrational excitation chemistry are unconventional and scarcely explored types of reactivity. Once fully understood, they might bring new avenues to conduct chemical transformations, providing access to a new world of molecules or ways of exquisite reaction control. In this context, we present here the discovery of two isomeric benzazirines exhibiting differential tunneling&#8208;driven and vibrationally&#8208;induced reactivity, which constitute exceptional results for probing into the nature of these phenomena. The isomeric 6&#8208;fluoro&#8208; and 2&#8208;fluoro&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2H&#8208;benzazirines (3&#8208;a and 3&#8242;&#8208;s) were generated in cryogenic krypton matrices by visible&#8208;light irradiation of the corresponding triplet nitrene 32&#8208;a, which was produced by UV&#8208;light irradiation of its azide precursor. The 3&#8242;&#8208;s was found to be stable under matrix dark conditions, whereas 3&#8208;a spontaneously rearranges (&#964;1/2 &#8764;64&#8197;h at 10 and 20&#8197;K) by heavy&#8208;atom tunneling to 32&#8208;a. Near&#8208;IR&#8208;light irradiation at the first OH stretching overtone frequencies (remote vibrational antenna) of the benzazirines induces the 3&#8242;&#8208;s ring&#8208;expansion reaction to a seven&#8208;member cyclic ketenimine, but the 3&#8208;a undergoes 2H&#8208;azirine ring&#8208;opening reaction to triplet nitrene 32&#8208;a. Computations demonstrate that 3&#8208;a and 3&#8242;&#8208;s have distinct reaction energy profiles, which explain the different experimental results. The spectroscopic direct measurement of the tunneling of 3&#8208;a to 32&#8208;a constitutes a unique example of an observation of a species reacting only by nitrogen tunneling. Moreover, the vibrationally&#8208;induced sole activation of the most favorable bond&#8208;breaking/bond&#8208;forming pathway available for 3&#8208;a and 3&#8242;&#8208;s provides pioneer results regarding the selective nature of such processes.

         <title>Aluminum&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Hydroboration of Esters and Epoxides to Alcohols: C&#8208;O Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, the molecular aluminum dihydride complex bearing an N, N&#8217;&#8208;chelated conjugated bis&#8208;guanidinate (CBG) ligand is used as a catalyst for reducing a wide range of aryl and alkyl esters with good tolerance of alkene (C=C), alkyne (C&#8801;C), halides (Cl, Br, I and F), nitrile (C&#8801;N), and nitro (NO2) functionalities. Further, we investigated the catalytic application of aluminum dihydride in the C&#8208;O bond cleavage of alkyl and aryl epoxides into corresponding branched Markovnikov ring&#8208;opening products. In addition, the chemoselective intermolecular reduction of esters over other reducible functional groups, such as amides and alkenes, has been established. Intermediates are isolated and characterized by NMR and HRMS studies, which confirm the probable catalytic cycles for the hydroboration of esters and epoxides.</dc:description>

         <title>Excitation&#8208;Wavelength&#8208;dependent Functionalities of Temporally&#8208;controlled Sensing and Generation of Singlet Oxygen by a Photoexcited State Engineered Rhodamine 6G&#8208;anthracene Conjugate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The present study provides design guidance for unique multipotent molecules that sense and generate singlet oxygen (  1  O  2  ). A rhodamine 6G&#8208;aminomethylanthracene&#8208;linked donor&#8208;acceptor molecule (  RA  ) is designed and synthesized for demonstrating wavelength&#8208;dependent functionalities as follows; (i)  RA  acts as a conventional fluorogenic  1  O  2  sensor molecule like the commercially available reagent, singlet oxygen sensor green (SOSG), when it absorbs ultraviolet (UV)&#8208;visible light and reacts with  1  O  2  . (ii)  RA  acts as a temporally&#8208;controlled  1  O  2  sensing reagent under the longer wavelength (~700 nm) photosensitization.  RA  enters an intermediate state after capturing  1  O  2  and does not become strongly fluorescent until it is exposed to UV, blue, or green light. (iii)  RA  acts as an efficient photosensitizer to generate  1  O  2  under green light illumination. The spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer mediated intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC) process achieves this function, and  RA  shows a potential cancer&#8208;killing effect on pancreatic cancer cells. The wavelength&#8208;switchable functionalities in  RA  offer to promise molecular tools to apply  1  O  2  in a spatiotemporal manner.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Protonated achiral H2TPPS4 spontaneously self&#8208;arranges at acids pH and high ionic strength to build mesoscopic J&#8208;aggregates that are intrinsically chiral. According to the symmetry rule aggregation leads to a racemate that, however, can be unbalanced by chemical (chiral pollutants) or physical stimuli (as vortexing the solution). Vortexing the title racemate, in principle, might either induce chiral separation or chiral enrichment. Indeed, herein it is shown that vortices enable the resolution of this racemic solution exploiting the tendency to deposit, onto the quartz cuvette walls, of the enantiomer favoured by the stirring sense. Simultaneously, over time, it was found that the opposite chiral conformation becomes prevalent in solution realizing a significant enantiomeric resolution. Therefore, after removing all stirring&#8208;favoured chiral J&#8208;aggregate from the solution, the recovering and isolating of the desired enantiomers from the cuvette walls was successfully obtained without complex procedures. In this sense, it has been demonstrated that the stirring forces are executively able to fulfil the chiral separation in H2TPPS4 J&#8208;aggregates, employed as model of a self&#8208;assembled system in aqueous solution.</dc:description>

         <title>An Extremely Stable Interprotein Tetrahedral Hg(Cys)4 Core Formed in the Zinc Hook Domain of Rad50 Protein at Physiological pH</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In nature, thiolate&#8208;based systems are the primary targets of divalent mercury (HgII) toxicity. The formation of Hg(Cys)x cores in catalytic and structural protein centers mediates mercury&#8217;s toxic effects and ultimately leads to cellular damage. Multiple studies have revealed distinct HgII&#8208;thiolate coordination preferences, among which the linear HgII complexes are the most commonly observed in solution at physiological pH. Trigonal or tetrahedral geometries are formed at basic pH or in tight intraprotein Cys&#8208;rich metal sites. So far, no interprotein tetrahedral HgII complex formed at neutral pH has been reported. Rad50 protein is a part of the multiprotein MRN complex, a major player in DNA damage repair processes. Its central region consists of a conserved CXXC motif that enable dimerization of two Rad50 molecules by coordinating ZnII. Dimerized motifs form a unique interprotein zinc hook domain (Hk), which is critical for the biological activity of the MRN. Using a series of length&#8208;differentiated peptide models of the P. furiosus zinc hook domain, we investigated its interaction with HgII. Using UV&#8208;Vis, CD, and PAC spectroscopies as well as anisotropy decay, and 199Hg&#8208;NMR, we discovered that all Rad50 fragments form preferentially homodimeric Hg(Hk)2 species with a distorted tetrahedral HgS4 coordination environment at physiological pH, which is the first example of an interprotein mercury site displaying tetrahedral geometry in solution. At higher HgII content, monomeric HgHk complexes with linear geometry are formed. The Hg(Cys)4 core of Rad50 is extremely stable and does not compete with cyanides, NAC, or DTT. Applying ITC, we found that the stability constant of the Rad50 Hg(Hk)2 complex is approximately three orders of magnitude higher than those of the strongest HgII complexes known to date.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein report a method for divergent copper salt controlled reactions of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes and  N  &#8208;fluorobenzene sulfonimide (NFSI). Specifically, in the presence of CuX  2  (X = Cl, Br), the cyclopropanes underwent  formal  umpolung 1,3&#8208;aminohalogenation bifunctionalization via a free radical mediated ring&#8208;opening process to afford 1,3&#8208;aminochlorination and 1,3&#8208;aminobromination products in moderate to good yields. In addition, by using CuI as a catalyst, we synthesized various aminoindane derivatives via 1,3&#8208;aminoarylation cyclizations of D&#8208;A cyclopropanes, the reactions involved a free radical mediated ring&#8208;opening and subsequent ring expansion via C&#8211;H bond activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Mediated Deoxygenative Radical Additions of Aromatic Acids to Vinyl Boronic Esters and gem&#8208;Diborylalkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new method to access &#946;&#8208;keto&#8208; gem &#8208;diborylalkanes, by direct deoxygenative radical addition of aromatic carboxylic acids to gem &#8208;dibortlalkenes, is described. The reaction proceeds under mild photoredox catalysis and involves the photochemical C&#8211;O bond activation of aromatic carboxylic acids in the presence of PPh 3 . It generates an acyl radical, which further undergoes an additional reaction with gem &#8208;diborylalkenes to form an &#945;&#8208; gem&#8208; diboryl alkyl radical intermediate, which then reduces to the corresponding anion, which after protonation, affords the &#946;&#8208;keto&#8208; gem diborylalkane product. Moreover, the same scenario has been extended to the vinyl boronic esters, e.g., gem &#8208;Ar, Bpin&#8208;alkenes. Importantly, this protocol provides a general platform for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of bio&#8208;active and drug molecules containing a carboxylic acid group.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of an Antimicrobial Enterobactin&#8208;Muraymycin Conjugate for Improved Activity against Gram&#8208;negative Bacteria</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Overcoming increasing antibiotic resistance requires the development of novel antibacterial agents that address new targets in bacterial cells. Naturally occurring nucleoside antibiotics (such as muraymycins) inhibit the bacterial membrane protein MraY, a clinically unexploited essential enzyme in peptidoglycan (cell wall) biosynthesis. Even though a range of synthetic muraymycin analogues has already been reported, they generally suffer from limited cellular uptake and a lack of activity against Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. We herein report an approach to overcome these hurdles: a synthetic muraymycin analogue has been conjugated to a siderophore, i.e. the enterobactin derivative EntKL, to increase the cellular uptake into Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. The resultant conjugate showed significantly improved antibacterial activity against an efflux&#8208;deficient E. coli strain, thus providing a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of this novel approach and a starting point for the future optimisation of such conjugates towards potent agents against Gram&#8208;negative pathogens.</dc:description>

         <title>Programmable Photocatalytic Activity of Multivariate Covalent Organic Frameworks Used as Metallaphotocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The multivariate approach allows to incorporate several functionalities into a single covalent organic framework (COF) and consequently allows the construction of bifunctional materials for cooperative catalysis. The well&#8208;defined structure of such multivariate COFs is furthermore ideally suited for structure&#8208;activity relationship studies. We report a series of multivariate COFs that contain acridine&#8208; and 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine linkers connected through 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetrialdehyde derivatives. The acridine motif is responsible for broad light absorption, while the bipyridine unit enables complexation of nickel catalysts. These features enable usage of the framework materials as catalysts for light&#8208;mediated carbon&#8211;heteroatom cross&#8208;couplings. Variation of the node units shows that the catalytic activity correlates to the keto&#8208;enamine tautomer isomerism. This allows switching between high charge&#8208;carrier mobility and persistent, localized charge&#8208;separated species depending on the nodes, a tool to tailor the materials for specific reactions. Moreover, nickel&#8208;loaded COFs are recyclable and catalyze cross&#8208;couplings even using red light irradiation.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of six highly lipophilic Cp&#8208;substituted molybdenocenes bearing different bioactive chelating ligands was synthesized and characterized by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and X&#8208;ray crystallography.  In vitro  experiments showed a greatly increased cytotoxic potency when compared to the non&#8208;Cp&#8208;substituted counterparts.  In vivo  experiments performed with the dichlorido precursor, (Ph2C&#8208;Cp)2MoCl2  and the in vitro most active complex, containing the thioflavone ligand, showed an inhibition of tumour growth. Proteomic studies on the same two compounds demonstrated a significant regulation of tubulin&#8208;associated and mitochondrial inner membrane proteins for both compounds and a strong metabolic effect of the thioflavone containing complex.</dc:description>

In vivo  experiments performed with the dichlorido precursor, (Ph2C-Cp)2MoCl2  and the in vitro most active complex, containing the thioflavone ligand, showed an inhibition of tumour growth. Proteomic studies on the same two compounds demonstrated a significant regulation of tubulin-associated and mitochondrial inner membrane proteins for both compounds and a strong metabolic effect of the thioflavone containing complex.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Umpolung Reactivity of Imine Ester: Visible&#8208;Light Mediated Transfer Hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;Aryl Imino Esters by Phenylsilane and Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light mediated chemoselective transfer hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;aryl imino esters was demonstrated. The methodology allowed the efficient and practical preparation of &#945;&#8208;amino acid esters. The mechanism of the reaction was probed by DFT calculations, and deuteration experiments indicated deuterium was introduced into amino acid esters efficiently (up to 99&#8201;% D ratio), enabling a feasible way to obtain deuterated amino acids using D2O as a cheap deuterium source.

         <title>Anion Recognition with Antimony(III) and Bismuth(III) Triaryl&#8208;Based Pnictogen Bonding Receptors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Antimony(III) and Bismuth(III) pnictogen bonding (PnB) triaryl&#8208;based anion receptors demonstrate PnB anion binding strength is influenced strongly by the electronic withdrawing nature of the aryl substituent and pnictogen atom donor identity. The triaryl PnB receptors display chloride anion selectivity over a range of halides and oxoanions. The synthesis and preliminary chloride anion binding investigations of the first mixed PnB&#8208;HB anion host systems are also described.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterisation of a library of acyclic antimony(III) and bismuth(III) triaryl pnictogen bonding (PnB) receptor systems are reported. In the first&#8208;generation receptor series, quantitative 1H&#8197;NMR chloride titration experiments in THF solvent media reveal halide anion binding potency is intimately correlated with both the electronic&#8208;withdrawing nature of the aryl&#8208; substituent and the polarisability of the PnB donor. Further extensive anion binding investigations with the most potent Sb&#8208; and Bi&#8208;based PnB receptors: 1&#8901;Sb2CF3 and 1&#8901;Bi2CF3, reveal novel selectivity profiles, both displaying Cl&#8722; selectivity relative to the heavier halides and, impressively, to a range of highly basic oxoanions. The synthesis and preliminary chloride anion binding studies of a series of novel tripodal tris&#8208;proto&#8208;triazole triaryl Sb(III) and Bi(III) mixed PnB&#8208;HB receptor systems are also described. Whereas parent triphenyl Sb(III) and Bi(III) compounds are incapable of binding Cl&#8722; in THF solvent media, the PnB&#8208;triazole HB host systems exhibit notable halide affinity.

         <title>Observing Nearby Nuclei on Paramagnetic Trityls and MOFs via DNP and Electron Decoupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron decoupling (eDec) attenuates the electron&#8208;nuclei hyperfine interaction (depicted as the magenta sphere) and, thus, improves the NMR sensitivity by &#8764;80&#8201;%. Furthermore, the combined DNP and eDec technique reveals that the intramolecular nuclei in trityl and paramagnetic MgHOTP MOF are outside the spin diffusion barrier.







Abstract
Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) is an NMR sensitivity enhancement technique that mediates polarization transfer from unpaired electrons to NMR&#8208;active nuclei. Despite its success in elucidating important structural information on biological and inorganic materials, the detailed polarization&#8208;transfer pathway from the electrons to the nearby and then the bulk solvent nuclei, and finally to the molecules of interest&#8208;remains unclear. In particular, the nuclei in the paramagnetic polarizing agent play significant roles in relaying the enhanced NMR polarizations to more remote nuclei. Despite their importance, the direct NMR observation of these nuclei is challenging because of poor sensitivity. Here, we show that a combined DNP and electron decoupling approach can facilitate direct NMR detection of these nuclei. We achieved an &#8764;80&#8201;% improvement in NMR intensity via electron decoupling at 0.35&#8197;T and 80&#8197;K on trityl radicals. Moreover, we recorded a DNP enhancement factor of 
 &#8764;90 and &#8764;11&#8201;% higher NMR intensity using electron decoupling on paramagnetic metal&#8208;organic framework, magnesium hexaoxytriphenylene (MgHOTP MOF).

         <title>Sterically and Electronically Flexible Pyridylidene Amine Dinitrogen Ligands at Palladium: Hemilabile cis/trans Coordination and Application in Dehydrogenation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new N,N,N&#8208;pyridylidene&#8211;amine (PYE) was synthesized, and its coordination to palladium was investigated. A flexible and hemilabile behavior of the ligand was put in light in terms of donation properties (zwitterionic vs. neutral) and in terms of geometry (cis/trans coordination). The complexes were found to catalytically dehydrogenate formic acid in CO2 and H2 in a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art activity.







Abstract
Ligand design is crucial for the development of new catalysts and materials with new properties. Herein, the synthesis and unique hemilabile coordination properties of new bis&#8208;pyridylidene amine (bis&#8208;PYE) ligands to palladium, and preliminary catalytic activity of these complexes in formic acid dehydrogenation are described. The synthetic pathway to form cationic complexes [Pd(bis&#8208;PYE)Cl(L)]X with a cis&#8208;coordinated N,N&#8208;bidentate bis&#8208;PYE ligand is flexible and provides access to a diversity of PdII complexes with different ancillary ligands (L=pyridine, DMAP, PPh3, Cl, P(OMe)3). The 1H&#8197;NMR chemical shift of the trans&#8208;positioned PYE N&#8722;CH3 unit is identified as a convenient and diagnostic handle to probe the donor properties of these ancillary ligands and demonstrates the electronic flexibility of the PYE ligand sites. In the presence of a base, the originally cis&#8208;coordinated bis&#8208;PYE ligand adopts a N,N,N&#8208;tridentate coordination mode with the two PYE units in mutual trans position. This cis&#8211;trans isomerization is reverted in presence of an acid, demonstrating a unique structural and steric flexibility of the bis&#8208;PYE ligand at palladium in addition to its electronic adaptability. The palladium complexes are active in formic acid dehydrogenation to H2 and CO2. The catalytic performance is directly dependent on the ligand bonding mode, the nature of the ancillary ligand, the counteranion, and additives. The most active system features a bidentate bis&#8208;PYE ligand, PPh3 as ancillary ligand and accomplishes turnover frequencies up to 525&#8197;h&#8722;1 in the first hour and turnover numbers of nearly 1000, which is the highest activity reported for palladium&#8208;based catalysts to date.

DNA&#8208;based cell surface engineering has greatly expanded the toolbox of cell surface engineering and gave rise to a variety of novel and fascinating applications. Herein, we summarize recent advances in DNA&#8208;based cell surface engineering and the biological applications in mimicking natural cellular components, regulating cell signal transduction, manipulating cell&#8208;cell interaction and tracking molecules on or around the cell surface.







Abstract
Due to its excellent programmability and biocompatibility, DNA molecule has unique advantages in cell surface engineering. Recent progresses provide a reliable and feasible way to engineer cell surfaces with diverse DNA molecules and DNA nanostructures. The abundant form of DNA nanostructures has greatly expanded the toolbox of DNA&#8208;based cell surface engineering and gave rise to a variety of novel and fascinating applications. In this review, we summarize recent advances in DNA&#8208;based cell surface engineering and its biological applications. We first introduce some widely used methods of immobilizing DNA molecules on cell surfaces and their application features. Then we discuss the approaches of employing DNA nanostructures and dynamic DNA nanotechnology as elements for creating functional cell surfaces. Finally, we review the extensive biological applications of DNA&#8208;based cell surface engineering and discuss the challenges and prospects of DNA&#8208;based cell surface engineering.

         <title>Bicomponent Cocatalyst Decoration on Flux&#8208;assisted CaTaO2N Single Crystals for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The well&#8208;defined CaTaO2N single crystals with uniform particle size were successfully synthesized through a one&#8208;pot NaCl&#8208;assisted nitridation procedure. The performance of photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO by H2O under visible light was enhanced due to the high crystallinity of CaTaO2N and the modification with core&#8208;shell structured Ni&#8722;Ag bicomponent cocatalyst.







Abstract
Cubic&#8208;like CaTaO2N photocatalysts with high crystallinity and uniform particle size were successfully prepared by the flux&#8208;assisted nitridation method. The growth of CaTaO2N single crystals under different synthesis conditions was systematically investigated to understand the effects of the crystallinity and optical property on photocatalytic performance of CO2 reduction. Moreover, the modification of CaTaO2N single crystals with core&#8208;shell Ni&#8722;Ag bicomponent cocatalyst by two&#8208;step decoration process gave a 2.4 times higher amount of CO evolution than the deposition of sole Ag cocatalyst, because of the synergistic effects of bicomponent cocatalyst on the interfacial electron transfer and surface catalytic process. This study provides a valuable way to construct high&#8208;crystalline photocatalysts with effective bicomponent cocatalyst for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction with H2O.

         <title>Rational Design of a Triple Tumor Microenvironment&#8208;Responsive Nanoplatform for Enhanced Tumor Theranostics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of responsive nanoplatforms based on the tumor microenvironment (TME) is critical for tumor diagnosis and treatment. Concentrating on a single TME&#8208;responsive nanoplatform, however, may result in insufficient diagnostic accuracy and treatment efficacy. Herein, layered double&#8208;hydroxides (LDHs) and rare earth nanomaterials (Er@Lu) were combined to create a triple TME&#8208;responsive nanoplatform that was then modified with cypate (a fluorescent dye with strong absorbance) by a peptide chain and loaded with epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a chemotherapeutic drug. Multiple responses to TME occurred when Er@Lu/LDH&#8208;EGCG reached the colorectal tumor region. Based on an acidic TME, the nanoplatform cracked and released Ni  2+  and EGCG. NiS, which was produced by the reaction of Ni  2+  with abundant H  2  S in tumor cells, was used for photothermal therapy and the released EGCG was used for chemotherapy. The MMP&#8208;7 enzyme specifically expressed in tumor cells recognized and cut the peptide chain, resulting in cypate release. The fluorescence of the Er@Lu was then restored along with the release of cypate because of the absorption competition disappearance. Compared to a single TME response, Er@Lu/LDH&#8208;EGCG with a triple TME response led to a better synergistic therapeutic effect  in vitro  and  in vivo  . This work has provided new approaches for developing multiple TME&#8208;responsive therapeutic nanoplatforms for synergistic therapy with improved diagnosis and therapeutic efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral&#8208;at&#8208;Metal Silver&#8208;Mediated Base Pairs: Metal&#8208;Centred Chirality versus DNA Helical Chirality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>When covalently incorporating ligands capable of forming chiral metal complexes into a DNA oligonucleotide duplex, an enantiospecific formation of metal&#8208;mediated base pairs is possible. We have been investigating the chirality of the silver&#8208;mediated base pair  P  &#8211;Ag  I  &#8211;  P  (  P  , 1  H  &#8208;imidazo[4,5&#8208;  f  ][1,10]phenanthroline) depending on the number of consecutive  P  :  P  pairs within a series of duplexes. Towards this end, both enantiomers of the nucleoside analogue 3&#8208;(1  H  &#8208;imidazo[4,5&#8208;  f  ][1,10]phenanthrolin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)propane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diol comprising an acyclic backbone were introduced into DNA duplexes, resulting in diastereomeric metal&#8208;mediated base pairs. The same chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal complex is formed inside the duplex for up to five neighbouring  P  &#8211;Ag  I  &#8211;  P  pairs, irrespective of whether (  S  )&#8208;  P  or (  R  )&#8208;  P  is used. With six silver&#8208;mediated base pairs, the chirality of the metal complex is inverted for (  S  )&#8208;  P  but not for (  R  )&#8208;  P  . This indicates an intricate balance of what determines the configuration of the metal complex, the intrinsically preferred metal&#8208;centred chirality or the DNA helical chirality.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Mechanism of the Formal [2+2] Cycloaddition &#8211; Retro&#8208;electrocyclization (CA&#8208;RE) Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The [2+2] cycloaddition &#8211; retro&#8208;electrocyclization (CA&#8211;RE) reaction is a &#8220;click&#8208;like&#8221; protocol for facile synthesis of donor&#8208;acceptor chromophores from an alkyne and tetracyanoethylene. Herein we shed light on the mechanism of this reaction by detailed kinetics studies using 1H&#8208;NMR spectroscopy. By considering several experiments simultaneously, a variety of mechanistic models was evaluated. Surprisingly, a model in which the final 1,1,4,4&#8208;tetracyanobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene product promoted the first step was the only one that described well the experimental data. This autocatalysis model also involved a non&#8208;concerted, stepwise formation of the cyclobutene cycloaddition adduct. By proper choice of conditions, we were able to generate the transient cyclobutene in sufficient amount to verify it as an intermediate using 13C&#8208;NMR spectroscopy. For its final retro&#8208;electrocyclization step, simple first&#8208;order kinetics was observed and only minor solvent dependence, which indicates a concerted reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Neutral Boryl Radicals in a Mixed&#8208;Valent B(III)&#8208;Br&#8230;B(II) Adducts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The general strategies to stabilize a boryl radical involve single electron delocalization by p&#8208;system and the steric hinderance by bulky groups. Herein we report a new class of boryl radicals with intramolecular mixed&#8208;valent B(III)&#8208;Br&#8230;B(II) adducts ligated by cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC). The radicals feature a large spin density on the boron center, which is ascertained by EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Structural and computational analyses revealed that the stability of radical species was assisted by CAAC ligand and the weak but significant B(III)&#8208;Br&#8230;B(II) interaction, suggesting a cooperative avenue for stabilization of boryl radicals. Two&#8208;electron reduction of these new boryl radicals provides C&#8208;H insertion products via a borylene intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Sulfur Atoms on TADF Properties from Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer Excited States</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Harnessing the heavy atom effect is the most useful way for boosting reverse intersystem crossing process for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters aiming to shorten the excited state lifetime and enhance the emission efficiency. A detailed investigation on S&#8208;containing TADF molecules featuring through&#8208;space charge transfer excited state shows that the heavier and bigger atom may have adverse effect because of its multiple roles.







Abstract
The harnessing of heavy atom effect of chalcogen elements offers a way for boosting the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) of purely organic luminescent materials that can harvest triplet excitons. However, the conformational and electronic variations induced by the heavy and large atoms may also have adverse effects on the TADF properties. Herein, the design, synthesis, and structures of a new type of through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) emitters containing benzothiazino[2,3,4&#8208;kl]phenothiazine (DPTZ) as the donor unit are reported. The influences of S atoms on the emission properties have been systematically investigated by means of theoretical simulations, electrochemical and spectroscopic studies. Although the presence of &#960;&#8208;stacking interactions and calculated spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) values are beneficial for TSCT&#8208;TADF properties, the triplet TSCT states are uplifted to above the locally excited (LE) state of the acceptor moieties. As a result, the new emitters display longer delayed fluorescence lifetimes (&#964;DF) of 255.0&#8211;114.3&#8197;&#956;s and lower PLQYs of 45&#8211;61&#8201;% in comparison with the O&#8208;containing congeners (&#964;DF=26.9&#8211;6.8&#8197;&#956;s; PLQYs=74&#8211;71&#8201;%). This work highlights that a full consideration of various effects is essential when making use of heavy chalcogen atoms for the design of TADF emitters.

         <title>Regulating Oxygen Configuration in Hierarchically Porous Carbon Nanosheets for High&#8208;Rate and Durable Na+ Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The low oxygen content (particularly low C&#8722;O/C=O ratio) and high graphitization degree of hierarchically porous carbon nanosheets are responsible for the enhanced electron/ion transfer kinetics, thus endowing it with high&#8208;rate and durable Na+ storage.







Abstract
Surface oxygen functionalities (particularly C&#8722;O configuration) in carbon materials have negative influence on their electrical conductivity and Na+ storage performance. Herein, we propose a concept from surface chemistry to regulate the oxygen configuration in hierarchically porous carbon nanosheets (HPCNS). It is demonstrated that the C&#8722;O/C=O ratio in HPCNS reduces from 1.49 to 0.43 and its graphitization degree increases by increasing the carbonization temperature under a reduction atmosphere. Remarkably, such high graphitization degree and low C&#8722;O content of the HPCNS&#8208;800 are favorable for promoting its electron/ion transfer kinetics, thus endowing it with high&#8208;rate (323.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.05&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 138.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 20.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and durable (96&#8201;% capacity retention over 5700&#8197;cycles at 10.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) Na+ storage performance. This work permits the optimization of heteroatom configurations in carbon for superior Na+ storage.

         <title>Competitive Photoisomerization and Energy Transfer Processes in Fluorescent Multichromophoric Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multichromophoric systems showing both fluorescence and photoisomerization were investigated by experimental and theoretical methods. We highlight the prominent role of intramolecular homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;energy transfer processes between the different isomers of the chromophores at the origin of their peculiar photophysical and photochemical properties.







Abstract
Multichromophoric systems showing both fluorescence and photoisomerization are fascinating, with complex interchromophoric interactions. The experimental and theoretical study of a series of compounds, bearing a variable number of 4&#8208;dicyanomethylene&#8208;2&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;6&#8208;(p&#8208;(N&#8208;(2&#8208;azidoethyl)&#8208;N&#8208;methyl)aminostyryl)&#8208;4H&#8208;pyran (DCM) units are reported. The photophysical properties of multi&#8208;DCM derivatives, namely 2DCM and 3DCM, were compared to the single model azido&#8208;functionalized DCM, in the E and Z isomers. The (EE)&#8208;2DCM and (EEE)&#8208;3DCM were synthesized via the click reaction. Steady&#8208;state spectroscopy and photokinetics experiments under UV or visible irradiation indicated the presence of intramolecular energy transfer processes among the DCM units. Homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;energy transfer processes between adjacent chromophores were confirmed by fluorescence anisotropy and decays. Molecular dynamics simulations for 2DCM were carried out and analyzed using a Markov state model, providing geometrical parameters (orientation and distance between chromophores) and energy transfer efficiency. This work contributes to a better understanding and rationalization of multiple energy transfer processes occuring within multichromophoric systems.

Discovering the aluminium location is a challenging endeavour in zeolites, as overlapping resonances complicate spectral assignment. Combining theoretical and experimental NMR is indispensable in spectral interpretation while the inclusion of configurationally diverse water molecules is essential.







Abstract
An important aspect within zeolite synthesis is to make fully tunable framework materials with controlled aluminium distribution. A major challenge in characterising these zeolites at operating conditions is the presence of water. In this work, we investigate the effect of hydration on the 27Al NMR parameters of the ultracrystalline K,Na&#8208;compensated aluminosilicate JBW zeolite using experimental and computational techniques. The JBW framework, with Si/Al ratio of 1, is an ideal benchmark system as a stepping stone towards more complicated zeolites. The presence and mobility of water and extraframework species directly affect NMR fingerprints. Excellent agreement between theoretical and experimental spectra is obtained provided dynamic methods are employed with hydrated structural models. This work shows how NMR is instrumental in characterising aluminium distributions in zeolites at operating conditions.

         <title>Organic Crystals with Response to Multiple Stimuli: Mechanical Bending, Acid&#8208;Induced Bending and Heating&#8208;Induced Jumping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiple stimuli&#8208;responsive molecular crystals are attracting extensive attentions due to their potential as smart materials, such as molecular machines, actuators, and sensors. However, the task of giving a single crystal multiple stimuli&#8208;responsive properties remains extremely challenging. Herein, we found two polymorphs (Form O and Form R) of a Schiff base compound, which could respond to multiple stimuli (external force, acid, heat). Form O and Form R have different elastic deformability, which can be attributed to the differences in the molecular conformation, structural packing and intermolecular interactions. Moreover, both polymorphs exhibit reversible bending driven by volatile acid vapor, for which we hypothesize is caused by reversible protonation reaction of imines with formic acid. In addition, jumping can be triggered by heating due to the significant anisotropic expansion. The integration of reversible bending and jumping into one single crystal expands the application scope of stimuli&#8208;responsive crystalline materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Naphthalenediimides with High&#8208;Efficiency Fluorescence and Circularly Polarized Luminescence in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Naphthalenediimides (NDIs) have been extensively studied due to their tunable luminescent properties. However, generally, the monomers or aggregates of non&#8208;core substituted NDIs exhibit low fluorescence quantum yields (&#1060;  FL  &lt; 10%) in the solid state, which limit their applications as light&#8208;emitting materials and render their chiral species unsuitable for circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Herein, we report a series of non&#8208;core substituted chiral NDIs that exhibit high luminous efficiencies (&#1060;  FL  up to 56.8% for racemate and 36.5% for enantiomer) and a strong CPL behavior in the solid state. These significant improvements are attributed to the unique molecular conformation of the chiral NDIs and the formation of distinctive discrete dimers. The structures of the NDIs were significantly simpler and more accessible than those of other NDIs. The findings evidence that non&#8208;core substituted NDIs can exhibit strong fluorescence in the solid state and provide a new pathway to improve photophysical properties of NDIs.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report visible light&#8208;promoted single nickel catalysis for diverse carbon&#8208;heteroatom couplings under mild conditions. This mild, general, and robust method to couple diverse nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur nucleophiles with aryl(heteroaryl)/alkenyl iodides/bromides exhibits a wide range of functional group tolerance and is applicable to late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceuticals and natural products. On the base of preliminary mechanistic studies, a NiI/NiIII cycle was tentatively proposed via the generation of active NiI complexes that appear from homolysis of NiII&#8208;I rather than NiII&#8208;aryl bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Recognition&#8208;Induced Enhanced Emission of Core&#8208;Fluorescent ESIPT&#8208;type Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Core&#8208;fluorescent cavitands based on 2&#8208;(2&#8242;&#8208;resorcinol)benzimidazole fluorophores (RBIs) merged with the resorcin[4]arene skeleton were designed and synthesized. The cavitands, due to the presence of intramolecular hydrogen bonds and increased acidity, show excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) and readily undergo deprotonation to form dianionic cavitands, capable of strong binding to organic cations. The changes in fluorescence are induced by deprotonation and binding events and involve huge Stokes shifts (due to emission from anionic double keto tautomers) and cation&#8208;selective enhancement of emission originating from the restriction of intramolecular motion (RIR) upon recognition in the cavity. Ab initio calculations indicate that the macrocyclic scaffold stabilizes the ground state tautomeric forms of the fluorophores that are not observed for non&#8208;macrocyclic analogs. In the excited state, the emitting forms for both macrocyclic scaffolds and non&#8208;macrocyclic analogs are anionic double keto tautomers, which are the result of excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) or excited state double proton transfer (ESDPT).</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Emitters for organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) require small singlet (S  1  )&#8208;triplet (T  1  ) energy gaps as well as fast intersystem crossing (ISC) transitions. These transitions can be mediated by the vibronic mixing with higher excited states S   n=2,3,4,&#8230;   and T   n=2,3,4,&#8230;   . For a prototypical TADF emitter consisting of a triarylamine and a dicyanobenzene moiety (TAA&#8208;DCN) it is shown that these higher states can be located energetically by time resolved near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Next Generation Copper Mediators for the Efficient Production of 18F&#8208;Labeled Aromatics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cu&#8208;mediated radiofluorination is a versatile tool for the preparation of  18F&#8208;labeled (hetero)aromatics. In this work, we systematically evaluated a series of complexes and identified several generally applicable mediators for highly efficient radiofluorination of aryl boronic and stannyl substrates. Utilization of these mediators in  n  BuOH/DMI or DMI significantly improved  18F&#8208;labeling yields despite use of lower precursor amounts. Impressively, application of 2.5 &#181;mol aryl boronic acids was sufficient to achieve  18F&#8208;labeling yields of up to 75%. The practicality of the novel mediators was demonstrated by efficient production of five PET&#8208;tracers and transfer of the method to an automated radiosynthesis module. In addition, (  S  )&#8208;3&#8208;[18F]FPhe and 6&#8208;[18F]FDOPA were prepared in activity yields of 23&#177;1% and 30&#177;3% using only 2.5 &#181;mol of the corresponding boronic acid or trimethylstannyl precursor.</dc:description>

         <title>G&#8208;type halohydrin dehalogenases catalyze ring opening reactions of cyclic epoxides with diverse anionic nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Halohydrin dehalogenases are promiscuous biocatalysts, which enable asymmetric ring opening reactions of epoxides with various anionic nucleophiles. However, despite the increasing interest in such asymmetric transformations, the substrate scope of G&#8208;type halohydrin dehalogenases toward cyclic epoxides has remained largely unexplored, even though this subfamily is the only one known to display activity with these sterically demanding substrates. Herein, we report on the exploration of the substrate scope of the two G&#8208;type halohydrin dehalogenases HheG and HheG2 and a newly identified, more thermostable member of the family, HheG3, with a variety of sterically demanding cyclic epoxides and anionic nucleophiles. This work shows that, in addition to azide and cyanide, these enzymes facilitate ring&#8208;opening reactions with cyanate, thiocyanate, formate, and nitrite, significantly expanding the known repertoire of accessible transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Solid&#8208;State Transformation of Na4SnS4&#183;14H2O into Na4Sn2S6&#183;5H2O: an Unusual Epitaxial Reaction Including Bond Formation, Mass Transport, and Ionic Conductivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly unusual solid&#8208;state epitaxy&#8208;induced phase transformation of Na4SnS4&#183;14H2O (I) into Na4Sn2S6&#183;5H2O (II) occurs at room temperature. Ab initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD) simulations indicate an internal acid&#8208;base reaction to form [SnS3SH]3&#8208; which condensate to [Sn2S6]4&#8208;. The reaction involves a complex sequence of O&#8208;H bond cleavage, S2&#8208; protonation, Sn&#8208;S bond formation and diffusion of various species while preserving the crystal morphology. In&#8208;situ Raman and IR spectroscopy evidence the formation of [Sn2S6]4&#8208;. DFT calculations allowed assignment of all bands appearing during the transformation. X&#8208;ray diffraction and in&#8208;situ1H NMR demonstrate a transformation within several days and yield a reaction turnover &#8776;0.38&#160;%/h. AIMD and experimental ionic conductivity data closely follow a Vogel&#8208;Fulcher&#8208;Tammann type T dependence with D(Na)=6&#215;10&#8209;14&#160;m2&#160;s&#8208;1 at T=300&#160;K with values increasing by three orders of magnitude from &#8208;20 to +25 &#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Post&#8208;Functionalization and Properties of Diphosphapentaarenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Linearly&#8208;fused poliarenes are an important class of compounds with high relevance in materials science. While modifying the shape and size represents a common means to fine&#8208;tune their properties, the precise placement of heteroatoms is strategy that is receiving an increasing deal of attention to overcome the intrinsic limitations of all&#8208; carbon structures. Thus, linearly&#8208;fused diphosphaarenes recently emerged as a novel family of molecules with striking optoelectronic properties and outstanding stability. However, the properties of diphosphaarenes are far from being benchmarked. Herein,&#160;we report the synthesis, phosphorus post&#8208;functionalization and properties of new diphosphapentaarene derivatives. We describe their synthetic limitations and unveil their potential for optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Calcium Hydride Cation Dimer Catalyzed Hydrogenation of Unactivated 1&#8208;alkenes and H2 Isotope Exchange: Competitive Ca&#8722;H&#8722;Ca Bridges and Terminal Ca&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, it was shown that the double Ca&#8722;H&#8722;Ca bridged calcium hydride cation dimer complex [LCaH  2  CaL]  2+  (macrocyclic ligand L = NNNN&#8208;tetradentate Me  4  TACD) showed remarkable activity in catalyzing the hydrogenation of unactivated 1&#8208;alkenes as well as the H  2  isotope exchange under mild conditions, tentatively via terminal Ca&#8722;H bond of cation monomer LCaH  +  . In this DFT mechanistic work, a novel substrate&#8208;dependent catalytic mechanism is disclosed involving cooperative Ca&#8722;H&#8722;Ca bridges for H  2  isotope exchange, competitive Ca&#8722;H&#8722;Ca bridges and terminal Ca&#8722;H bonds for anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition of unactivated 1&#8208;alkenes, and terminal Ca&#8722;H bonds for Markovnikov addition of conjugation&#8208;activated styrene. THF&#8208;coordination plays a key role in favoring the anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition while strong cation&#8208;&#960; interactions direct the Markovnikov addition to terminal Ca&#8722;H bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Dithiolopyrrolones are Prochelators that Are Activated by Glutathione</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dithiolopyrrolones (DTPs), such as holomycin, are natural products that hold promise as scaffolds for antibiotics as they exhibit inhibitory activity against antibiotic&#8208;resistant pathogens. They consist of a unique bicyclic core containing a disulfide that is crucial for their biological activity. Herein, we establish the DTPs as prochelators. We show that the disulfides are reduced at cellular gluathione levels. This activates the drugs and initiates interactions with targets, particularly metal coordination. In addition, we report an expedient synthesis for the DTPs thiolutin and aureothricin, providing facile access to important natural DTPs and derivatives thereof.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing netlike nanosheets of ZnO/BiOCl with hetero&#8208;junction as robust material for electrochemical amine detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical sensing is a potential method for detection of trace toxic substance. Herein, the heterojunction of netlike ZnO/BiOCl nanosheets was constructed for the enhanced electrochemical detection of ammonia. Cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry were used to investigate the electrochemical performance. The results show that the ZnO/BiOCl&#8208;modified electrode exhibits higher sensitivity towards ammonia compared with the ZnO and BiOCl&#8208;based electrodes, which is ascribed to band structure and fast electron transfer. The high response of 11.8 &#956;A mM  &#8722;1  and a low detection limit (LOD) of 0.25 &#956;M are achieved. In addition, the ZnO/BiOCl material exhibits high selectivity, repeatability and stability. The better linear relationship between concentration and current (R=0.99) is significant for quantitative detection of ammonia, implying that netlike ZnO/BiOCl nanosheets can serve as electrochemical sensing platform for detecting toxic substance. This research provides a strategy for fabricating two&#8208;dimensional netlike materials and regulating heterojunctions used for electrochemical application.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Progress in Rechargeable Sodium Metal Batteries: A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium metal batteries (SMBs) have been widely studied owing to the relatively high energy density and abundant resources. However, they still need systematic improvement to fulfill the harsh operating conditions for the commercialization of SMBs. In this review, we summarize the recent progress on SMBs in terms of Na anode modification, electrolyte exploration, and cathode design. Firstly, we give an overview of the current challenges facing to Na metal anodes and the corresponding solutions. Then, the traditional liquid electrolytes and the prospective solid electrolytes for SMBs have been summarized. In addition, the insertion&#8208;type cathode materials and conversion&#8208;type cathode materials have also been introduced. Finally, the future outlook for the practical SMBs has been provided.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous loading of Ni2P cocatalysts on the inner and outer surfaces of mesopores P&#8208;doped carbon nitride hollow spheres for enhanced photocatalytic water splitting activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Promoting charge separation, constructing active sites, and improving the utilization of metal atoms are very important for the design of efficient photocatalysts. We report a simultaneous loading of Ni  2  P cocatalysts on the inner and outer surfaces of mesoporous P&#8208;doped carbon nitride hollow nanospheres (PCNHS) to construct a Ni  2  P@PCNHS@Ni  2  P photocatalyst. Ni  2  P cocatalysts loading provides enough active sites on both the inner and outer surfaces for proton reduction, and the formed heterojunctions simultaneously promote the migration and separation of the photogenerated charges on the inner and outer surfaces. The photocatalytic reaction proceeds simultaneously on the inner and outer surfaces of Ni  2  P@PCNHS@Ni  2  P, which leads to a significantly improved photocatalytic water splitting performance and enhanced atomic utilization. Notably, the hydrogen evolution rate of Ni  2  P@PCNHS@Ni  2  P is 2.4 times higher than that of Pt&#8208;loaded PCNHS. The findings guide the design of hollow nanostructured composites with high&#8208;boosting photocatalytic performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactivity of sodium pentaphospholide Na[cyclo&#8208;P5] towards C&#8801;E (E = C, N, P) triple bonds.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A diglyme solution of Na[cyclo&#8208;P5] (1) reacts with alkynes and the isolobal nitriles and phosphaalkynes to afford the otherwise elusive (aza)phospholide anions 2a&#8208;c, 4a,b, and 6. The reaction of Na[cyclo&#8208;P5] with alkynes and nitriles was studied by means of DFT methods, which suggest a concerted mechanism for the formation of 2a and 4b. The anions 2a&#8208;c, 4a,b, and 6 coordinate in an &#951;5&#8208;fashion towards Fe(II) to give the sandwich (aza)phosphametallocenes 3a&#8208;c, 5a,b and 7 in moderate to good yields. The new compounds were characterized by means of multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and cyclic voltammetry.</dc:description>

         <title>A Hydride&#8208;Substituted Homoleptic Silylborate: How Similar is it to its Diborane(6)&#8208;Dianion Isostere?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The B&#8208;nucleophilic 9H&#8208;9&#8208;borafluorene dianion reacts with 9&#8208;chloro&#8208;9&#8208;silafluorene to afford air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable silylborate salts M[Ar2(H)B&#8722;Si(H)Ar2] (M[HBSiH], M = Li, Na). Li[HBSiH] and Me3SiCl give the B&#8722;pyridine adduct Ar2(py)B&#8722;Si(H)Ar2 ((py)BSiH) or the chlorosilane Li[Ar2(H)B&#8722;Si(Cl)Ar2] (Li[HBSiCl]) in C6H6&#8208;pyridine or THF. In both cases, the first step is H&#8722; abstraction at the B center. The resulting free borane subsequently binds a py or thf ligand. While the py adduct is stable at room temperature, the thf adduct undergoes a 1,2&#8208;H shift via the cyclic B(&#956;&#8208;H)Si intermediate BHSi, which is afterwards attacked at the Si atom by a Cl&#8722; ion to give Li[HBSiCl]. DFT calculations were employed to support the proposed reaction mechanism and to characterize the electronic structure of BHSi. Treatment of Li[HBSiCl] with the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene IMe introduces the neutral donor at the Si atom and leads to Ar2(H)B&#8722;Si(IMe)Ar2 (HBSi(IMe)), a donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;stabilized silylene.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Resonant Thermally Activated Delayed&#160;Fluorescent (MR&#8208;TADF) Compounds as Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) compounds, such as 4CzIPN, have become a widely used sub&#8208;class of organic photocatalysts for a plethora of photocatalytic reactions. Multi&#8208;resonant TADF (MR&#8208;TADF) compounds, a subclass of TADF emitters that are rigid nanographene derivatives, such as DiKTa and Mes3DiKTa, have to date not been explored as photocatalysts. In this study both DiKTa and Mes3DiKTa were found to give comparable or better product yield than 4CzIPN in a range of photocatalytic processes that rely upon reductive quenching, oxidative quenching, energy transfer and dual photocatalytic processes. In a model oxidative quench process, DiKTa and Mes3DiKTa gave increased reaction rates in comparison to 4CzIPN, with DiKTa being of particular interest due to the lower material cost (&#163;0.94/mmol) compared to that of 4CzIPN (&#163;3.26/mmol). These results suggest that DiKTa and Mes3DiKTa would be excellent additions to any chemist&#8217;s collection of photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>A Lewis Acid Stabilized Ketenimine in an Unusual Variant of the Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By the action of a strong Lewis acid, isomerization of the tricyanomethane to the ketenimine, HN=C=C(CN)2, is triggered, which in turn directly attacks an aromatic species in an electrophilic aromatic substitution.







Abstract
Electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) can provide a straightforward approach to the efficient synthesis of functionalized complex aromatic molecules. In general, Lewis acids serve as a beneficial stimulus for the formation of a Wheland complex, the intermediate in the classical SEAr mechanism of EAS, which is responsible for H/E (E=electrophile) substitution under formal H+ elimination. Herein, we report an unusual variant of EAS, in which a complex molecule such as the tricyanomethane, HC(CN)3, is activated with a strong Lewis acid (B(C6F5)3) to the point where it can finally be used in an EAS. However, the Lewis acid here causes the isomerization of the tricyanomethane to the ketenimine, HN=C=C(CN)2, which in turn directly attacks the aromatic species in the EAS, with simultaneous proton migration of the aromatic proton to the imino group, so that no elimination occurs that is otherwise observed in the SEAr mechanism. By this method, it is possible to build up amino&#8208;malononitrile&#8208;substituted aromatic compounds in one step.

         <title>Bismuth Gadolinium Oxychloride with a Remarkable Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Responsive O2 Evolution Activity Promoted by Iodine Doping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iodine&#8208;doped Bi2GdO4Cl with a significantly promoted visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive O2&#8208;evolving performance of 154.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 and an apparent quantum efficiency of &#8764;1.1&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm is reported. The incorporation of I&#8722; ions causes the extended light absorption and promoted charge separation.







Abstract
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive bismuth&#8208;based oxyhalide has recently attracted extensive attention, however, the promotion of its charge separation is still challenging. Herein, we introduce iodine into Bi2GdO4Cl to synthetize I&#8208;doped Bi2GdO4Cl (denoted as yI&#8722;Bi2GdO4Cl, 0&#8804;y&#8804;2). The incorporation of I&#8722; ions is found to enhance light absorption and to accelerate charge separation by combining various characterizations such as density functional theory calculation, photoelectrochemical test, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectrum, and open&#8208;circuit voltage decay. The O2&#8208;evolving performances of 1I&#8722;Bi2GdO4Cl with optimized dopant concentration of I&#8722; ion and IrO2 loaded 1I&#8722;Bi2GdO4Cl are tremendously enhanced by ca. 4 and 45&#8197;times compared to pristine Bi2GdO4Cl. Notably, The O2 evolution rate reaches as high as 154.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 with an apparent quantum efficiency of &#8764;1.1&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm.

The incorporation of I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ions causes the extended light absorption and promoted charge separation.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visible-light-responsive bismuth-based oxyhalide has recently attracted extensive attention, however, the promotion of its charge separation is still challenging. Herein, we introduce iodine into Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;GdO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl to synthetize I-doped Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;GdO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl (denoted as yI&#8722;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;GdO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl, 0&#8804;y&#8804;2). The incorporation of I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ions is found to enhance light absorption and to accelerate charge separation by combining various characterizations such as density functional theory calculation, photoelectrochemical test, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectrum, and open-circuit voltage decay. The O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-evolving performances of 1I&#8722;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;GdO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl with optimized dopant concentration of I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ion and IrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; loaded 1I&#8722;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;GdO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl are tremendously enhanced by ca. 4 and 45&#8197;times compared to pristine Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;GdO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl. Notably, The O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution rate reaches as high as 154.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with an apparent quantum efficiency of &#8764;1.1&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm.

         <title>Mechanistic Investigation of Alkali&#8208;Treated Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction: The Role of OH&#8722; and Metal Cations for Almost 100&#8201;% Selectivity of CO</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism for alkali&#8208;treated photocatalyst in CO2 photoreduction is studied, especially for demonstrating the role of OH&#8722; and metal cations in detail for highly selective production of CO. DFT calculations confirmed that K ions enhance the charge density of nearby atoms to stabilize CO* groups and reduce the reaction energy barrier, inducing the switch of CH4 to CO.







Abstract
In this work, the modulation of activity and selectivity via photoreduction of carbon dioxide under simulated sunlight was achieved by treating P25 and P25/Pt NPs with KOH. It found that KOH treatment could significantly improve the overall conversion efficiency and switch the selectivity for CO. Photoelectric characterizations and CO2&#8208;TPD demonstrated that the synergistic effect of K+ and OH&#8208; accelerated the separation and migration of photogenerated charges, and also improved CO2 adsorption level. Significantly, the K ions could act as active sites for CO2 adsorption and further activation. In situ FTIR measurements and DFT calculations confirmed that K+ enhanced the charge density of adjacent atoms and stabilize CO* groups, reducing the reaction energy barrier and inducing the switching of original CH4 to CO, which played a selective regulatory role. This study provides insights into the photocatalytic activity and selectivity of alkali&#8208;treated photocatalysts and facilitates the design of efficient and product&#8208;specific photocatalysis.

Insight into a sustainable and environmentally valuable technology: Benefitting from superior chemical stability, electrochemical conductivity, biocompatibility, and surface area, functional nanomaterials&#8208;based electrocathodes, nanostructured photocathodes, and semiconductor nanomaterials have been recognized as promising candidates for microbial CO2 reduction to value&#8208;added chemicals. This minireview surveys the latest advances in the rational design of nanomaterials for different types of microbial CO2 reduction systems.







Abstract
Microbial electro&#8208; and photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction represents an opportunity to tackle the environmental demand for sustainable fuel production. Nanomaterials critically impact the electricity&#8208; and solar&#8208;driven microbial CO2 reduction processes. This minireview comprehensively summarizes the recent developments in the configuration and design of nanomaterials for enhancement of the bacterial adhesion and extracellular electron transfer (EET) processes, based on the modification technologies of improving chemical stability, electrochemical conductivity, biocompatibility, and surface area. Furthermore, the investigation of incorporating non&#8208;photosynthetic microorganisms using advanced light&#8208;harvesting nanostructured photoelectrodes for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion, as well as the current understanding of EET mechanisms occurring at photosynthetic semiconductor nanomaterials&#8208;bacteria biohybrid interface is detailed. The crucial factors influencing the performance of microbial CO2 reduction systems and future perspectives are discussed to provide guidance for the realization of their large&#8208;scale application.

         <title>&#8220;Activated Borane&#8221; &#8211; A Porous Borane Cluster Network as an Effective Adsorbent for Removing Organic Pollutants</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous polymer: Thermolysis of nido&#8208;B10H14 and toluene at 250&#8201;&#176;C affords the novel microporous polymer named &#8220;activated borane&#8221;. Analyses suggests an amorphous structure of borane clusters interconnected by toluene moieties. Activated borane displays a high surface area of 774&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1, thermal stability under Ar up to 1000&#8201;&#176;C, and sorption capacity to emerging pollutants exceeding the capacity of commercial activated carbon.







Abstract
The unprecedented co&#8208;thermolysis of decaborane(14) (nido&#8208;B10H14) and toluene results in a novel porous material (that we have named &#8220;activated borane&#8221;) containing micropores between 1.0 and 1.5&#8197;nm in diameter and a specific surface area of 774&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 (Ar, 87&#8197;K) that is thermally stable up to 1000&#8201;&#176;C. Solid state 1H, 11B and 13C&#8197;MAS NMR, UV&#8208;vis and IR spectroscopies suggest an amorphous structure of borane clusters interconnected by toluene moieties in a ratio of about three toluene molecules for every borane cluster. In addition, the structure contains Lewis&#8208;acidic tri&#8208;coordinated boron sites giving it some unique properties. Activated borane displays high sorption capacity for pollutants such as sulfamethoxazole, tramadol, diclofenac and bisphenol A that exceed the capacity of commercially&#8208;available activated carbon. The consistency in properties for each batch made, and the ease of its synthesis, make activated borane a promising porous material worthy of broad attention.

         <title>Intermetallic Nanocrystals: Seed&#8208;Mediated Synthesis and Applications in Electrocatalytic Reduction Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intermetallic nanocrystals (IMNCs) have attracted extensive attention as electrocatalysis. However, precise control over the size, shape, composition, structure, and exposed crystal facet of IMNCs seems to be a challenge, although these parameters have a significant effect on the electrocatalytic performance. The seed&#8208;mediated synthesis approach is a promising tool for precise control over these parameters of IMNCs.







Abstract
In recent years, intermetallic nanocrystals (IMNCs) have attracted extensive attention in the field of electrocatalysis. However, precise control over the size, shape, composition, structure, and exposed crystal facet of IMNCs seems to be a challenge to the traditional method of high&#8208;temperature annealing although these parameters have a significant effect on the electrocatalytic performance. Controllable synthesis of IMNCs by the wet chemistry method in the liquid phase shows great potential compared with the traditional high&#8208;temperature annealing method. In this Review, we attempt to summarize the preparation of IMNCs by the seed&#8208;mediated synthesis in the liquid phase, as well as their applications in electrocatalytic reduction reactions. Several representative examples are purposely selected for highlighting the huge potential of the seed&#8208;mediated synthesis approach in chemical synthesis. Specifically, we personally perceive the seed&#8208;mediated synthesis approach as a promising tool in the future for precise control over the size, shape, composition, structure, and exposed crystal facet of IMNCs.

         <title>Enantiodivergent Chemoenzymatic Dynamic Kinetic Resolution: Conversion of Racemic Propargyl Alcohols into Both Enantiomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Choosing the outcome: A silyl group at the alkyne terminal of secondary propargyl alcohols temporarily inverted the enantio&#8208;recognition of natural lipases. Using this phenomenon, the lipase/oxovanadium co&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of racemic alcohols achieved enantiodivergent production of R and S enantiomers in high yield and with high enantiomeric excess.







Abstract
Natural lipases typically recognize enantiomers of alcohols based on the size differences of substituents near the carbinol moiety and selectively react with the R enantiomers of secondary alcohols. Therefore, lipase&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of racemic secondary alcohols produces only R enantiomers. We report herein a method for obtaining S enantiomers by DKR of secondary 3&#8208;(trialkylsilyl)propargyl alcohols by using a well&#8208;known R&#8208;selective Pseudomonas fluorescens lipase in combination with a racemization catalyst VMPS4, in which the silyl group reverses the size relationship of substituents near the carbinol moiety. We have already reported R&#8208;selective DKR of the corresponding propargyl alcohols without substituents on the ethynyl terminal carbon, and the presence of an easily removable silyl group has enabled us to produce both enantiomers of propargyl alcohols in high chemical yields and with high enantiomeric excess. In addition, immobilization of the lipase on Celite was found to be important for achieving a high efficiency of the DKR.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lead (Pb) halide perovskite nanocrystals, with the general formula APbX3, where A = CH3NH3+, CH(NH2)2+, or Cs+ and X = Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, or I&#8208;, have emerged as a class of materials with promising properties due to their remarkable optical properties and solar cell performance. However, important issues still need to be addressed to enable practical applications of these materials, such as instability, mass production, and Pb toxicity. Recent studies have carried out the replacement of Pb by various less&#8208;toxic cations as Sn, Ge, Sb, and Bi. This variety of chemical compositions provide Pb&#8208;free perovskite and metal halide nanostructures with a wide spectral range, in addition to being considered less toxic, therefore having greater practical applicability. Highlighting the necessity to address and solve the toxicity problems related to Pb&#8208;containing perovskite, this review considers the prospects of the Pb&#8208;free perovskite, involving synthesis methods, and properties of them, including advantages, disadvantages, and applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrostannylation of Red Phosphorus: A Convenient Route to Monophosphines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Valuable, industrially and academically relevant monophosphorus compounds are accessible directly from red phosphorus by using commonly available reagents. Only modest inert&#8208;atmosphere techniques are needed, making this a convenient and practical methodology for the preparation of P1 compounds from elemental, red phosphorus.







Abstract
The preparation of valuable and industrially relevant organophosphorus compounds currently depends on indirect multistep procedures involving difficult&#8208;to&#8208;handle white phosphorus as a common P atom source. Herein, we report a practical and versatile method for the synthesis of a variety of monophosphorus compounds directly from the bench&#8208;stable allotrope red phosphorus (Pred). The relatively inert Pred was productively functionalised by using the cheap and readily available radical reagent tri&#8208;n&#8208;butyltin hydride, and subsequent treatment with electrophiles yields useful P1 compounds. Remarkably, these transformations require only modest inert&#8208;atmosphere techniques and use only reagents that are inexpensive and commercially available, making this a convenient and practical methodology accessible in most laboratory settings.

         <title>Enabling Aromatic Hydroxylation in a Cytochrome P450 Monooxygenase Enzyme through Protein Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural and biochemical data demonstrate that 4&#8208;phenylbenzoic acid binds within the active site of the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase CYP199A4, but no oxidation occurs. Protein engineering and molecular dynamic simulations establish that aromatic oxidation is enabled by a subtle shift of the substrate relative to the heme, thus improving our understanding of this important reaction.







Abstract
The cytochrome P450 (CYP) family of heme monooxygenases catalyse the selective oxidation of C&#8722;H bonds under ambient conditions. The CYP199A4 enzyme from Rhodopseudomonas palustris catalyses aliphatic oxidation of 4&#8208;cyclohexylbenzoic acid but not the aromatic oxidation of 4&#8208;phenylbenzoic acid, due to the distinct mechanisms of aliphatic and aromatic oxidation. The aromatic substrates 4&#8208;benzyl&#8208;, 4&#8208;phenoxy&#8208; and 4&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;benzoic acid and methoxy&#8208;substituted phenylbenzoic acids were assessed to see if they could achieve an orientation more amenable to aromatic oxidation. CYP199A4 could catalyse the efficient benzylic oxidation of 4&#8208;benzylbenzoic acid. The methoxy&#8208;substituted phenylbenzoic acids were oxidatively demethylated with low activity. However, no aromatic oxidation was observed with any of these substrates. Crystal structures of CYP199A4 with 4&#8208;(3&#8242;&#8208;methoxyphenyl)benzoic acid demonstrated that the substrate binding mode was like that of 4&#8208;phenylbenzoic acid. 4&#8208;Phenoxy&#8208; and 4&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;benzoic acid bound with the ether or ketone oxygen atom hydrogen&#8208;bonded to the heme aqua ligand. We also investigated whether the substitution of phenylalanine residues in the active site could permit aromatic hydroxylation. Mutagenesis of the F298 residue to a valine did not significantly alter the substrate binding position or enable the aromatic oxidation of 4&#8208;phenylbenzoic acid; however the F182L mutant was able to catalyse 4&#8208;phenylbenzoic acid oxidation generating 2&#8242;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;, 3&#8242;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208; and 4&#8242;&#8208;hydroxy metabolites in a 83&#8201;:&#8201;9&#8201;:&#8201;8 ratio, respectively. Molecular dynamics simulations, in which the distance and angle of attack were considered, demonstrated that in the F182L variant, in contrast to the wild&#8208;type enzyme, the phenyl ring of 4&#8208;phenylbenzoic acid attained a productive geometry for aromatic oxidation to occur.

         <title>Hydrophilic Chitosan Derivatives: Synthesis and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A benign and low&#8208;cost alternative for fossil&#8208;fuel&#8208;sourced polymers, chitosan has tremendous potential because of its bioactivity, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and low toxicity. Synthetic pathways for chitosan derivatives with improved water solubility, and their associated applications, are explored. With the change in global direction towards a lower carbon economy and reduced environmental impact, fine&#8208;tuning chitosan properties is essential for a better future.







Abstract
Polymer alternatives sourced from nature have attracted increasing attention for applications in medicine, cosmetics, agriculture, food, water purification, and more. Among them, chitosan is the most versatile due to its full biodegradability, exceptional biocompatibility, multipurpose bioactivity, and low toxicity. Although remarkable progress has been made in its synthetic modification by using C3/C6 secondary/primary hydroxy (&#8722;OH) and the C2 amino (&#8722;NH2) active sites, its solubility under physiological conditions remains limited and has hampered larger&#8208;scale adoption. This review summarizes different synthetic methods that increase chitosan&#8216;s hydrophilicity and water solubility by using covalent modifications, namely amino acid addition, quaternary ammonium formation, phosphorylation, and carboxymethylation. We also review several applications for each type of substitution in fields such as cosmetics, medicine, agriculture, and water purification, and provide an outlook and perspective for future modifications and implementations.

         <title>Magnetic Hyperthermia Enhancement in Iron&#8208;based Materials Driven by Carbon Support Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The control of both the thickness of the protective carbon layer, and the size and composition of the nascent confined iron nanoparticles is driven by carbon support interactions. The iron hybrid materials (Fe3C@C/CNFAC) obtained from acid&#8208;treated carbon supports exhibit enhanced specific absorption rate values in biocompatible media.







Abstract
Magnetic hyperthermia (MH) shows great potential in clinical applications because of its very localized action and minimal side effects. Because of their high saturation magnetization values, reduced forms of iron are promising candidates for MH. However, they must be protected in order to overcome their toxicity and instability (i.&#8201;e., oxidation) under biological conditions. In this work, a novel methodology for the protection of iron nanoparticles through confinement within graphitic carbon layers after thermal treatment of preformed nanoparticles supported on carbon is reported. We demonstrate that the size and composition of the nascent confined iron nanoparticles, as well as the thickness of their protective carbon layer can be controlled by selecting the nature of the carbon support. Our findings reveal that a higher nanoparticle&#8211;carbon interaction, mediated by the presence of oxygen&#8208;containing groups, induces the formation of small and well&#8208;protected &#945;&#8208;Fe&#8208;based nanoparticles that exhibit promising results towards MH based on their enhanced specific absorption rate values.

         <title>DOTP versus DOTA as Ligands for Lanthanide Cations: Novel Structurally Characterized CeIV and CeIII Cyclen&#8208;Based Complexes and Clusters in Aqueous Solutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocyclic chelates sometimes offer peripheral bonding for partially hydrolyzed multivalent cations clusters rather than their tight encapsulation inside the chelate &#8220;cage&#8221;. DOTA and DOTP chelates (1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;(tetrayl)tetraacetic acid) and &#8208;(tetra(methylene phosphonic acid)), respectively) were used to study these chemical and structural motifs with the tetravalent cerium cation in aqueous solutions.







Abstract
The coordination and redox chemistry of aqueous CeIV/III macrocyclic compounds were studied by using the ligands DOTA and DOTP (1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;tetrayl)tetraacetic acid and 1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;tetra(methylene phosphonic acid), respectively). The hydrolysis tendency of the tetravalent cation in the presence of DOTA is shown to result in the formation of a highly ordered, fluorite&#8208;like [CeIV6(O)4(OH)4(H2O)8(DOTAH)4] oxo&#8208;hydroxo structure both in solution and in the solid state. The lifetime of the analogous species formed in the presence of DOTP was found to be much shorter. Spectroscopic measurements of the latter suggest its similarity to the former. Its gradual decomposition in solution leads to the accumulation of the in&#8208;cage complexes [CeIVDOTP] and [CeIIIDOTP(H2O)], which were crystallographically characterized in this study. The redox energetics and spectroscopic characteristics for the transition between these two in&#8208;cage complexes in aqueous solutions were studied as well. Together with the crystallographic structures of the above&#8208;mentioned species, the in&#8208;cage [CeIVDOTA(H2O)] complex structure is presented herein for the first time. An elaborative analysis of the X&#8208;ray crystallographic structural data obtained for the in&#8208;cage complexes studied herein and similar structures published previously suggests that hard&#8208;bonding cyclen&#8208;derived ligands are, counter&#8208;intuitively, better suited for encapsulating, and perhaps kinetically stabilize softer cations than harder ones with DOTP, marked as a possible adequate chelator for the study of the aqueous properties of LnII and AcIII cations.
