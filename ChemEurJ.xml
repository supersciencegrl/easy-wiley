         <title>Photochemical Sandmeyer&#8208;type Halogenation of Arenediazonium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One hundred and forty years after its discovery, key limitations of the Sandmeyer reaction were overcome. The use of trihalide salts as mediators enable the photochemical conversion of diazonium salts into the corresponding aryl halides without an environmentally problematic transition&#8208;metal mediator. A wide variety of aryl bromides, chlorides and iodides were formed in excellent selectivities for halogenation over hydridodediazotization, obviating the laborious separation of halogenated products from non&#8208;halogenated analogues.@ruhrunibochum







Abstract
Trihalide salts were found to efficiently promote photochemical dediazotizing halogenations of diazonium salts. In contrast to classical Sandmeyer reactions, no metal catalysts are required to achieve high yields and outstanding selectivities for halogenation over competing hydridodediazotization. Convenient protocols are disclosed for synthetically meaningful brominations, iodinations, and chlorinations of diversely functionalized derivatives.

The noble&#8208;gas difluorides, NgF2 (Ng=Kr, Xe), react with MOF4 (M=Mo, W) in HF solvent and melts to form NgF2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;MOF4 and XeF2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2MOF4. Structures and bonding were characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. The NgF2 ligands coordinate to the metal through F&#8208;bridges, where Fb is trans to M=O in FtNgFb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;MOF4 and Fb&#8217; is cis to M=O and trans to M&#8217;=O in FtXeFb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;M(OF3)Fb&#8242;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;M&#8242;OF4.







Abstract
The NgF2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;MOF4 (Ng=Kr, Xe; M=Mo, W) and XeF2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2MOF4 complexes were synthesized in anhydrous HF (aHF) solvent and melts, respectively. Their single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) structures show NgF2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;MOF4 and XeF2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2MOF4 have Ft&#8722;Ng&#8722;Fb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;M arrangements, in which the NgF2 ligands coordinate to MOF4 through Ng&#8722;Fb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;M bridges. The XeF2 ligands of XeF2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2MOF4 also coordinate to F3OM&#8722;Fb&#8217;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;M'OF4 moieties through Xe&#8722;Fb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;M bridges to form Ft&#8722;Xe&#8722;Fb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;M(OF3)&#8722;Fb&#8217;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;M'OF4, where XeF2 coordinates trans to the M=O bond and Fb&#8217; coordinates trans to the M&#8217;=O bond. The Ng&#8722;Ft, Ng&#8722;Fb, and M&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;Fb bond lengths of NgF2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;nMOF4 are consistent with MOF4 and F3OM&#8722;Fb&#8217;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;M'OF4 fluoride&#8208;ion affinity trends: CrOF4&lt;MoOF4&lt;WOF4&#8776;F3OMo&#8722;Fb&#8217;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;Mo'OF4&lt;F3OW&#8722;Fb&#8217;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;W'OF4. The [&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;(F4OMo)(&#956;3&#8208;F)H&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;(&#956;&#8208;F)H&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;]&#8734; and [H3F2][W2O2F9] solvates were also synthesized in aHF and characterized by SCXRD. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations show the M&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;Fb bonds of NgF2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;MOF4 and XeF2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2MOF4 are predominantly electrostatic, &#963;&#8208;hole type bonds.

The impact of clickable side chains and click adducts on heterochiral DNA with complementary strands in the &#945;&#8208;d and &#946;&#8208;d configurations and their homochiral counterparts with both strands in the &#945;&#8208;d or &#946;&#8208;d configuration is investigated. For this, the &#945;&#8208;anomers of 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridine and 7&#8208;deaza&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine were synthesized, converted to phosphoramidites, and employed in solid&#8208;phase oligonucleotide synthesis.

Abstract
Anomeric base pairs in heterochiral DNA with strands in the &#945;&#8208;d and &#946;&#8208;d configurations and homochiral DNA with both strands in &#945;&#8208;d configuration were functionalized. The &#945;&#8208;d anomers of 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridine and 7&#8208;deaza&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine were synthesized and functionalized with clickable octadiynyl side chains. Nucleosides were protected and converted to phosphoramidites. Solid&#8208;phase synthesis furnished 12&#8208;mer oligonucleotides, which were hybridized. Pyrene click adducts display fluorescence, a few of them with excimer emission. Tm values and thermodynamic data revealed the following order of duplex stability &#945;/&#945;&#8208;d&#8811;&#946;/&#946;&#8208;d&#8805;&#945;/&#946;&#8208;d. CD spectra disclosed that conformational changes occur during hybridization. Functionalized DNAs were modeled and energy minimized. Clickable side chains and bulky click adducts are well accommodated in the grooves of anomeric DNA. The investigation shows for the first time that anomeric DNAs can be functionalized in the same way as canonical DNA for potential applications in nucleic acid chemistry, chemical biology, and DNA material science.

&lt;p&gt;Anomeric base pairs in heterochiral DNA with strands in the &#945;-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; and &#946;-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; configurations and homochiral DNA with both strands in &#945;-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; configuration were functionalized. The &#945;-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; anomers of 2&#8242;-deoxyuridine and 7-deaza-2&#8242;-deoxyadenosine were synthesized and functionalized with clickable octadiynyl side chains. Nucleosides were protected and converted to phosphoramidites. Solid-phase synthesis furnished 12-mer oligonucleotides, which were hybridized. Pyrene click adducts display fluorescence, a few of them with excimer emission. &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; values and thermodynamic data revealed the following order of duplex stability &#945;/&#945;-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&#8811;&#946;/&#946;-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&#8805;&#945;/&#946;-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;. CD spectra disclosed that conformational changes occur during hybridization. Functionalized DNAs were modeled and energy minimized. Clickable side chains and bulky click adducts are well accommodated in the grooves of anomeric DNA. The investigation shows for the first time that anomeric DNAs can be functionalized in the same way as canonical DNA for potential applications in nucleic acid chemistry, chemical biology, and DNA material science.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electronic circular dichroism&#8208;circularly polarized Raman (eCP&#8208;Raman): a new form of chiral Raman spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We summarize recent works on the discovery of a new form of chiral Raman spectroscopy,  e  CP&#8208;Raman, which combines two spectroscopies: electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and circularly polarized Raman (CP&#8208;Raman). First, some puzzling observations while carrying out Raman optical activity (ROA) measurements of several transition metal complexes under resonance are described, as well as the search for the mechanisms responsible. Then an equation for quantifying the  e  CP&#8208;Raman contribution is presented, followed by several examples of how  e  CP&#8208;Raman influences  the  I  R  &#8211; I  L  spectra of achiral and chiral solvent molecules and of a number of chiral solutes under resonance. The conditions to extract resonance ROA, when the  e  CP&#8208;Raman contribution is minimized, are also discussed. Finally, we comment on the potential applications of  e  CP&#8208;Raman.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalized Graphene Quantum Dots Modified Dioxin&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks for Superior Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic framework, as an emerging porous nano&#8208;frame structure with pre&#8208;designed structure and custom properties, has been demonstrated as a prospective electrode for rechargeable Li&#8208;ion batteries. For improving the reversible capacity and long&#8208;term cycle stability of COF materials, we propose a GQDs modified COF material (COF&#8208;GQDs) and apply it as the anode for LIBs for the first time. This COF&#8208;GQDs electrode delivers enhanced long&#8208;term cycling performance with a large capacity of ~820 mAh g  &#8208;1  after 300 cycles of at 100 mA g  &#8208;1  and the improved rate performance. The enhanced lithium&#8208;storage performance, in terms of obvious&#8208;shortened activation process and high reversible capacities, can be attributed to the modification of carboxyl GQDs, which would activate more active sites (activated C=C groups from benzene rings) for lithium&#8208;storage, and provide fast lithium&#8208;ion transportation kinetic. Besides, the decreased interphase resistance, enhanced electronic conductivity, and prevented aggregation of needle&#8208;flake COF structure, originated from the addition of GQDs, lead to the enhanced improved cycling stability of COF&#8208;GQDs electrode. This manuscript can promote the further exploration on the design of COF&#8208;related materials with modification of functionalized carbonaceous materials to achieve the enhanced lithium&#8208;storage properties for next&#8208;generation energy storage.</dc:description>

         <title>An Increment System to Predict the Effect of Different London Dispersion Donors in all&#8208;meta Substituted Azobenzenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For many chemical phenomena predictive models based on increment systems exist allowing an easy prediction. Despite its low magnitude in isolated systems London dispersion interaction are ubiquitous in manifold situation ranging from solvation to catalysis or in biological systems. Based on our azobenzene system we systematically determined the London dispersion donor strength of different alkyl substituents ranging from Me, Et,  i  Pr up to  t  Bu. Based on this data we were able to implement an increment system for London dispersion for this azobenzene scheme. We propose an equation, which allows to predict the effect of change of substituents on London dispersion interactions in this arrangement which has to be validated in similar molecular arrangements in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure and Interaction Based Design of Anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Aptamers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aptamer selection against novel infections is a complicated and time&#8208;consuming approach. Synergy can be achieved by using computational methods together with experimental procedures. This study aims to develop a reliable methodology for a rational aptamer  in silico  et vitro  design. The new approach combines multiple steps: (1) Molecular design, based on screening in a DNA aptamer library and directed mutagenesis to fit the protein tertiary structure; (2) 3D molecular modeling of the target; (3) Molecular docking of an aptamer with the protein; (4) Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the complexes; (5) Quantum&#8208;mechanical (QM) evaluation of the interactions between aptamer and target with further analysis; (6) Experimental verification at each cycle for structure and binding affinity using small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, cytometry, and fluorescence polarization. Using a new iterative design procedure, Interaction Based Drug Design (SIBDD), a highly specific aptamer to the receptor&#8208;binding domain of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein, was developed and validated.
The SIBDD approach enhances speed of the high&#8208;affinity aptamers development from scratch, using a target protein structure. The method could be used to improve existing aptamers for stronger binding. This approach brings to an advanced level the development of novel affinity probes, functional nucleic acids. It offers a blueprint for the straightforward design of targeting molecules for new pathogen agents and emerging variants.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Reactivity and Structural Properties of Trifluoromethylphosphoranides</title>

         <dc:description>Phosphoranides are interesting hypervalent species which serve as model compounds for intermediates or transition states in nucleophilic substitution reactions at trivalent phosphorus substrates. Herein, we report on the syntheses and properties of stable trifluoromethylphosphoranide salts.

These [P(CF  3  )  4&#8208;n  F  n  ]  &#8722;  (n = 0&#8208;2) salts exhibit fluorinating (n = 1&#8208;2) or trifluoromethylating (n = 0) properties, which is disclosed by studying their reactivity towards selected electrophiles. The solid&#8208;state structures of [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][P(CF  3  )  4  ] and [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][P(CF  3  )  3  F] are ascertained by single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. The dynamics of these compounds are investigated by variable temperature NMR spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Minimalist photo&#8208;reactive probes, which consist of a photo&#8208;reactive group and a tag for detection of target proteins, are useful tools in chemical biology. Although several diazirine&#8208;based and aryl azide&#8208;based minimalist probes are available, no keto&#8208;based minimalist probe has yet been reported. Here we describe minimalist probes based on 2&#8208;thienyl&#8208;substituted &#945;&#8208;ketoamide bearing an alkyne group on the thiophene ring. The 3&#8208;alkyne probe showed the highest photo&#8208;affinity labeling efficiency</dc:description>

         <title>Putting Anion&#8208;&#960; Interactions at Work for Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 3, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emergence and development of the concept of &#8220;anion&#8208;&#960; catalysis&#8221;, that employing an electron&#8208;deficient &#960; surface for anionic intermediate and transition state stabilization, is illustrated. Different activation modes are presented to highlight the essential contribution of anion&#8208;&#960; interactions, from both ground&#8208;state and transition&#8208;state stabilization to solely transition&#8208;state stabilization, and to cooperative &#960;&#8208;face activation.







Abstract
Since its discovery two decades ago, anion&#8208;&#960; interaction has been increasingly recognized as an important driving force. Extensive theoretical and experimental efforts on the ground&#8208;state anion&#8208;&#960; binding and recognition have laid the bases for exploring its relevance in catalysis. Accordingly, the concept of &#8220;anion&#8208;&#960; catalysis&#8221; that employing an electron&#8208;deficient &#960; surface (&#960;&#8208;acidic surface) for anionic reaction intermediate and transition state stabilization has emerged. This article shortly reviews the emergence and development of this concept, aiming to provide an emphasis on the general concept and key progress in this exciting area. To highlight the essential contribution of anion&#8208;&#960; interactions, the contents are organized according to their role engaged in catalytic process, for example from both ground&#8208;state and transition&#8208;state stabilization to solely transition&#8208;state stabilization, mainly by a single &#960;&#8208;face, and to cooperative &#960;&#8208;face activation. A concluding remark and outlook on future development of this field is also given.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Pulvomycin D</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 3, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Fragile Diva: Trienone units and the elimination&#8208;prone hydroxy groups render pulvomycin D a capricious target, the total synthesis of which required a subtle endgame strategy, including a Heck reaction (3) and a sequential release of six silyl protecting groups combined with a Peterson elimination reaction (4). Earlier key steps of the synthesis included a diastereoselective aldol reaction (1) and a regioselective Yamaguchi esterification (2).







Abstract
A synthetic route to the pulvomycin class of natural products is presented, which culminated in the first synthesis of a pulvomycin, pulvomycin D. Key elements of the strategy include a pivotal aldol reaction which led to bond formation between the C24&#8208;C40 and the C8&#8208;C23 fragment. The remaining C1&#8208;C7 fragment was attached by a Yamaguchi esterification completing the assembly of the 40 carbon atoms within the main skeleton. Ring closure to the 22&#8208;membered lactone ring was achieved in the final stages of the synthesis by a Heck reaction. The completion of the synthesis required the removal of six silyl protecting groups in combination with olefin formation at C26&#8208;C27 by a Peterson elimination.

         <title>Helic[6]arene&#8208;Based Chiral Pseudo[1]rotaxanes and [1]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 3, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting from enantiomeric helic[6]arenes, a new system of chiral pseudo[1]rotaxanes is developed, which subsequently provided a pair of chiral [1]rotaxanes in almost quantitative yields. Moreover, the chirality transfer in the chiral [1]rotaxanes is also observed.







Abstract
Chiral pseudo[1]rotaxanes and [1]rotaxanes constructed from macrocyclic arenes still remain a big challenge mainly owing to the lack of such chiral macrocycles. In this work, a new system of chiral pseudo[1]rotaxanes formed by self&#8208;inclusion of helic[6]arene containing amide linked with the terminal tertiary amines was first discovered. Based on an atom&#8208;economic stopping strategy, a pair of chiral [1]rotaxanes were conveniently obtained in almost quantitative yields by blocking the pseudo[1]rotaxanes with monobenzyl bromide of tetraphenylethene. The structures of pseudo[1]rotaxanes and [1]rotaxanes were characterized by 2D NMR spectra in solution, combined with DFT calculations. The photophysical properties further revealed the efficient chirality transfer of helic[6]arene to the tetraphenylethene moiety, compared to their unthreaded chiral isomers. The discovery of the chiral pseudo[1]rotaxanes allows for a wide and available synthesis of chiral [1]rotaxanes, and also opening a new avenue to the design of chiral supramolecular materials.

The crystalline phosphorus superbase tris(1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethylguanidinyl)phosphine is accessible through an easy and scalable procedure starting from cheap and commercially available bulk chemicals. The properties of the strongly electron&#8208;donating phosphine in coordination chemistry and the reactivity with small molecules (CO2, SO2, N2O and elemental chalcogens) were studied.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and properties of the much sought&#8208;after tris(1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethylguanidinyl) phosphine P(tmg)3, a crystalline, superbasic phosphine accessible through a short and scalable procedure from the cheap and commercially available bulk chemicals 1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethylguanidine, tris(dimethylamino)&#8208;phosphine and phosphorus trichloride. The new phosphine exhibits exceptional electron donor properties and readily forms transition metal complexes with gold(I), palladium(II) and rhodium(I) precursors. The formation of zwitterionic Lewis base adducts with carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide was explored. In addition, the complete series of phosphine chalcogenides was prepared from the reaction of P(tmg)3 with N2O and the elemental chalcogens.

Diversified Groebke&#8208;Blackburn&#8208;Bienaym&#233; Approach: Diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of cyclophanyl&#8208;derived fused imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]heterocycles by one&#8208;pot Groebke&#8208;Blackburn&#8208;Bienaym&#233; (GBB) three&#8208;component reaction employing formyl&#8208;cyclophane components in combination with various aliphatic and aromatic isocyanides and different heteroaromatic amidines is described. Additionally, a one&#8208;pot protocol for the GBB 3CR process by an in&#8208;situ generation of cyclophanyl isocyanide is demonstrated. The cyclophanyl imidazole ligands can be readily transformed to showcase their useful utility in preparing N,C palladacycles via regioselective ortho&#8208;palladation.







Abstract
This report describes the synthesis of a [2.2]paracyclophane&#8208;derived annulated 3&#8208;amino&#8208;imidazole ligand library through a Groebke&#8208;Blackburn&#8208;Bienaym&#233; three&#8208;component reaction (GBB&#8208;3CR) approach employing formyl&#8208;cyclophanes in combination with diverse aliphatic and aromatic isocyanides and heteroaromatic amidines. The GBB&#8208;3CR process gives access to skeletally&#8208;diverse cyclophanyl imidazole ligands, namely 3&#8208;amino&#8208;imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines and imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrazines. Additionally, a one&#8208;pot protocol for the GBB&#8208;3CR by an in&#8197;situ generation of cyclophanyl isocyanide is demonstrated. The products were analyzed by detailed spectroscopic techniques, and the cyclophanyl imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine was confirmed unambiguously by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;Ray crystallography. The cyclophanyl imidazole ligands can be readily transformed to showcase their useful utility in preparing N,C&#8208;palladacycles through regioselective ortho&#8208;palladation.

         <title>H2S Dosimetry by CuO: Towards Stable Sensors by Unravelling the Underlying Solid&#8208;State Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 3, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper(II)oxide and copper(II)sulfide nanostructures are prepared for a detailed investigation of the dosimetric sensing mechanism of hydrogensulfide, aiming at an improvement of the long&#8208;term stability of these sensors. Based on the received insights a long&#8208;term stability in more than 250 sensing and regeneration cycles is achieved.







Abstract
The precise detection of the toxic gas H2S requires reliable sensitivity and specificity of sensors even at minute concentrations of as low as 10&#8197;ppm, the value corresponding to typical exposure limits. CuO can be used for H2S dosimetry, based on the formation of conductive CuS and the concomitant significant increase in conductance. In theory, at elevated temperature the reaction is reversed and CuO is formed, ideally enabling repeated and long&#8208;term use of one sensor. Yet, the performance of CuO tends to drop upon cycling. Utilizing defined CuO nanorods we thoroughly elucidated the associated detrimental chemical changes directly on the sensors, by Raman and electron microscopy analysis of each step during sensing (CuO&#8594;CuS) and regeneration (CuS&#8594;CuO) cycles. We find the decrease in the sensing performance is mainly caused by the irreversible formation of CuSO4 during regeneration. The findings allowed us to develop strategies to reduce CuSO4 formation and thus to substantially maintain the sensing stability even for repeated cycles. We achieved CuO&#8208;based dosimeters possessing a response time of a few minutes only, even for 10&#8197;ppm H2S, and prolonged life&#8208;time.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Multi&#8208;Photon Tracking and Bioimaging of Glycosylated Theranostic Prodrugs upon Specific Enzyme Triggered Release</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 3, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycosylated theranostic prodrugs have been developed, whereby the therapeutic component undergoes triggered release upon enzyme activation of the glycosidic bond through action of the specific glycosidase enzymes, resulting in selective delivery of the therapeutic cargo, a process observed through real&#8208;time bioimaging.







Abstract
Real&#8208;time tracking of prodrug uptake, delivery and activation in&#8197;vivo represents a major challenge for prodrug development. Herein, we demonstrate the use of novel glycosylated theranostics of the cancer pharmacophore Amonafide in highly&#8208;selective, enzymatic triggered release. We show that the use of endogenous enzymes for activated release of the therapeutic component can be observed, in real time, and monitored using one and two&#8208;photon bioimaging, offering unique insight into the prodrug pharmacokinetic profile. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the potent cytotoxicity of Amonafide is preserved using this targeted approach.

         <title>An NHC&#8208;Stabilized H2GeBH2 Precursor for the Preparation of Cationic Group 13/14/15 Hydride Chains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 3, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The NHC&#8208;stabilized compound IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH2BH2OTf was synthesized. Reactivity studies on this novel building block with different phosphines and AsPh3 showed its potential to serve as an ideal precursor for unprecedented cationic group 13/14/15 chain compounds. In addition, a reaction with PH3 leads to the formation of the parent hydrides [IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH2BH2PH3][OTf] and [IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH3][OTf].







Abstract
The synthesis, characterization and reactivity studies of the NHC&#8208;stabilized complex IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH2BH2OTf (1) (IDipp=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) are reported. Nucleophilic substitution of the triflate (OTf) group in 1 by phosphine or arsine donors provides access to the cationic group 13/14/15 chains [IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH2BH2ERR1R2]+ (2 E=P; R, R1=H; R2=tBu; 3 E=P; R=H; R1, R2=Ph; 4&#8201;a E=P; R, R1, R2=Ph; 4&#8201;b E=As; R, R1, R2=Ph). These novel cationic chains were characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Moreover, the formation of the parent complexes [IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH2BH2PH3][OTf] (5) and [IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH3][OTf] (6) were achieved by reaction of 1 with PH3. Accompanying DFT computations give insight into the stability of the formed chains with respect to their decomposition.

         <title>Highly Stable Univalent Copper of a Cu@Al/SBA&#8208;15 Nanocomposite Catalyzes the Synthesis of Fluorescent Aminobenzotriazoles Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 3, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of 1,2&#8208;diaminobenzene to benzotriazoles catalyzed by stable univalent copper of Cu@Al/SBA&#8208;15 nanocomposites is presented. A Cu@Al/SBA&#8208;15 nanocomposite of stable univalent copper was prepared and used for a new catalytic synthesis strategy to synthesize a series of novel amino&#8208;containing benzotriazoles with great fluorescence properties. In this strategy, there is no need to add other ligands and co&#8208;catalysts, the reaction time is short, the yield of products is high, and the catalyst can be reused many times without adding other related ligands and cocatalyst.







Abstract
With the development of green chemistry, it is still a challenge to maintain the unstable valence state of the metal in heterogeneous catalysts and realize new catalytic synthesis methods. In this paper, it is reported that an univalent copper nanocomposite (Cu@Al/SBA&#8208;15) can efficiently catalyze the formation of novel amino&#8208;containing benzotriazoles with great fluorescence properties in a new synthetic strategy. Subsequently, its application is further verified by an acylation reaction to produce a series of novel benzotriazoles derivatives with high yield. It is worth noting that the Cu@Al/SBA&#8208;15 nanocomposites not only enable the reaction completed with high yield in a short time, but can also be recycled many times without a significant reduction in activity, and the leaching of copper and aluminum species in reaction system is negligible. Finally, the detailed and feasible reaction mechanism is also provided.

         <title>Highly Efficient Ir(III)&#8208;Coumarin Photo&#8208;Redox Catalyst for Synergetic Multi&#8208;Mode Cancer Photo&#8208;Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 3, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four novel Ir(III) photo&#8208;catalysts (Ir1&#8211;Ir4) were synthesized and applied for photocatalytic cancer therapy. Upon blue and green light irradiation, these photocatalysts generated singlet oxygen and induced rapid photo&#8208;catalytic oxidation of the cellular coenzymes NAD(P)H. Ir2 triggered promising photo&#8208;induced anticancer activity via induction of intracellular redox imbalance and exhibited ideal in&#8197;vivo photo&#8208;induced catalytic anticancer activity.







Abstract
Four photo&#8208;catalysts of the general formula [Ir(CO6/ppy)2(L)]Cl where CO6=coumarin 6 (Ir1&#8211;Ir3), ppy=2&#8208;phenylpyridine (Ir4), L=4&#8242;&#8208;(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine (Ir1), 4&#8242;&#8208;(3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine (Ir2 and Ir4), and 4&#8208;([2,2&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridin]&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;yl)&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethylaniline (Ir3) were synthesized and characterized. These photostable photo&#8208;catalysts (Ir1&#8211;Ir3) showed strong visible light absorption between 400&#8211;550&#8197;nm. Upon light irradiation (465 and 525&#8197;nm), Ir1&#8211;Ir3 generated singlet oxygen and induced rapidly photo&#8208;catalytic oxidation of cellular coenzymes NAD(P)H. Ir1&#8211;Ir3 showed time&#8208;dependent cellular uptake with excellent intracellular retention efficiency. Upon green light irradiation (525&#8197;nm), Ir2 provided a much higher photo&#8208;index (PI=793) than the clinically used photosensitizer, 5&#8208;aminolevulinicacid (5&#8208;ALA, PI&gt;30) against HeLa cancer cells. The observed necro&#8208;apoptotic anticancer activity of Ir2 was due to the Ir2 triggered photo&#8208;induced intracellular redox imbalance (by NAD(P)H oxidation and ROS generation) and change in the mitochondrial membrane potential. Remarkably, Ir2 showed in&#8197;vivo photo&#8208;induced catalytic anticancer activity in mouse models.

         <title>Prebiotically Plausible Autocatalytic Peptide Amyloids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 3, January 13, 2022. </description>

The plus side of amyloids? Peptide amyloids have an inherent templating ability that underlies the infectivity and progression of prion and other neurodegenerative diseases as well as guiding the synthesis of melanin. Such amyloid&#8208;based templating has been shown to support the sequence&#8208;selective, regioselective and stereoselective addition of amino acids to a complementary peptide chain. Here we report that the templating nature of amyloids also supports the autocatalytic self&#8208;replication of peptides. The relevance to a prebiotic role for amyloids is discussed.







Abstract
The prebiotic emergence of molecules capable both of self&#8208;replication and of storing information was a defining event at the dawn of life. Still, no plausible prebiotic self&#8208;replication of biologically relevant molecules has been demonstrated. Building upon the known templating nature of amyloids, we present two systems in which the products of a peptide&#8208;bond&#8208;forming reaction act as self&#8208;replicators to enhance the yield and stereoselectivity of their formation. This first report of an amino acid condensation that can undergo autocatalysis further supports the potential role of amyloids in prebiotic molecular evolution as an environment&#8208;responsive and information&#8208;coding system capable of self&#8208;replication.

         <title>The Significant Influence of a Second Metal on the Antiproliferative Properties of the Complex [Ru(&#951;6&#8722;C10H14)(Cl2)(dmoPTA)]</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 3, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coordination of a second metal (Zn, Co, or Ni) to a monometallic [Ru(&#951;6&#8722;C10H14)(Cl2)(dmoPTA)] complex, which is obtained from deprotonation of [Ru(&#951;6&#8722;C10H14)(Cl2)(HdmoPTA)](OSO2CF3), had a significant influence and increased antiproliferative activity. Moreover, the bis&#8208;metallic complexes are selective as no reduction in normal cell viability is observed in their presence. On the other hand, the complexes display different properties and mechanisms of action depending on the nature of the second metal, M.







Abstract
Complexes [Ru(&#951;6&#8722;C10H14)(Cl2)(HdmoPTA)](OSO2CF3) (1), [Ru(&#951;6&#8722;C10H14)(Cl2)(dmoPTA)] (2) and [Ru(&#951;6&#8722;C10H14)(Cl2)&#8208;&#956;&#8208;dmoPTA&#8208;1&#954;P:2&#954;2N,N&#8217;&#8208;MCl2] (M=Zn (3), Co (4), Ni (5), dmoPTA=3,7&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3,7&#8208;triaza&#8208;5&#8208;phosphabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane) have been synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis and spectroscopic techniques. The crystal structures of 1, 3 and 5 were obtained by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The antiproliferative activity of the complexes was evaluated against colon cancer cell line Caco&#8208;2/TC7 by using the MTT protocol. The monometallic ruthenium complexes 1 and 2 were found to be inactive, but the bimetallic complexes 3, 4 and 5 display an increased activity (IC50 3: 9.07&#177;0.27, 4: 5.40&#177;0.19, 5: 7.15&#177;0.30&#8197;&#956;M) compared to cisplatin (IC50=45.6&#177;8.08&#8197;&#956;M). Importantly, no reduction in normal cell viability was observed in the presence of the complexes. Experiments targeted to obtain information on the possible action mechanism of the complexes, such as cell cycle, ROS and gene expression studies, were performed. The results showed that the complexes display different properties and action mechanism depending on the nature of metal, M, bonded to the CH3NdmoPTA atoms.

The crystal structures of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; were obtained by single-crystal X-ray diffraction.

The monometallic ruthenium complexes &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; were found to be inactive, but the bimetallic complexes &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; display an increased activity (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;

Importantly, no reduction in normal cell viability was observed in the presence of the complexes. Experiments targeted to obtain information on the possible action mechanism of the complexes, such as cell cycle, ROS and gene expression studies, were performed. The results showed that the complexes display different properties and action mechanism depending on the nature of metal, M, bonded to the CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;dmoPTA&lt;/sub&gt; atoms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

You can play Pac Man with Phosphorus! The first non&#8208;metal Pacman compound, a calix[4]pyrrole schiff base ligand coordinating two highly dynamic P(III)Cl moieties is presented. Chloride abstraction with AgOTf leads to a macrocyclic dication with two embedded phosphorus monocations, both of which undergo a cooperative internal activation reaction.







Abstract
Formal coordination of phosphorus(III) by a calix[4]pyrrole Schiff base ligand was achieved through the reaction of this ligand with PCl3 under basic conditions. The reaction product adopts a Pacman conformation with two P&#8722;Cl moieties, one in exo and one in endo position. It represents the first non&#8208;metal compound of calix[4]pyrrole Schiff base ligands and of Pacman ligands in general. The spatial neighborhood of the two phosphorus atoms enables cooperative reactions. As a first example, the chloride abstraction with AgOTf is presented, yielding a macrocyclic dication with two embedded phosphorus(III) monocations, which both undergo a cooperative, internal activation reaction with an adjacent C=N double bond. This intramolecular redox process affords two pentacoordinated phosphorus(V) centers within the Pacman dication. All reaction products were fully characterized and all results are supported by computations.

         <title>Europium is Different: Solvent and Ligand Effects on Oxidation State Outcomes and C&#8208;F Activation in Reactions Between Europium Metal and Pentafluorophenylsilver</title>

A novel ovoid EuII cage with a rare &#956;4&#8208;pyrazolate binding including an &#951;5&#8208;(N2C3)&#8208;Eu bond is reported. Solvent and ligand variations affect the oxidation state outcomes, and the synthesis features the first C&#8722;F activation by AgC6F5 in redox transmetallation/protolysis (RTP) reactions.







Abstract
Unique outcomes have emerged from the redox transmetallation/ protolysis (RTP) reactions of europium metal with [Ag(C6F5)(py)] (py=pyridine) and pyrazoles (RR&#8242;pzH). In pyridine, a solvent not normally used for RTP reactions, the products were mainly EuII complexes, [Eu(RR&#8242;pz)2(py)4] (RR&#8242;pz=3,5&#8208;diphenylpyrazolate (Ph2pz) 1; 3&#8208;(2&#8208;thienyl)&#8208;5&#8208;trifluoromethylpyrazolate (ttfpz) 2; 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;5&#8208;phenylpyrazolate (PhMepz) 3). However, use of 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylpyrazole (tBu2pzH) gave trivalent [Eu(tBu2pz)3(py)2] 4, whereas the bulkier N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;difluorophenyl)formamidine (DFFormH) gave divalent [Eu(DFForm)2(py)3] 5. In tetrahydrofuran (thf), the usual solvent for RTP reactions, C&#8722;F activation was observed for the first time with [Ag(C6F5)(py)] in such reactions. Thus trivalent [{Eu2(Ph2pz)4(py)4(thf)2(&#956;&#8208;F)2}{Eu2(Ph2pz)4(py)2(thf)4(&#956;&#8208;F)2}] (6), [Eu2(ttfpz)4(py)2(dme)2(&#956;&#8208;F)2] (7), [Eu2(tBu2pz)4(dme)2(&#956;&#8208;F)2] (8) were obtained from the appropriate pyrazoles, the last two after crystallization from 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (dme). Surprisingly 3,5&#8208;dimethylpyrazole (Me2pzH) gave the divalent cage [Eu6(Me2pz)10(thf)6(&#956;&#8208;F)2] (9). This has a compact ovoid core held together by bridging fluoride, thf, and pyrazolate ligands, the last including the rare &#956;4&#8208;1&#951;5(N2C3): 2&#951;2(N,N&#8242;): 3&#954;(N): 4&#954;(N&#8242;) pyrazolate binding mode. With the bulky N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)formamidine (DippFormH), which often favours C&#8722;F activation in RTP reactions, neither oxidation to EuIII nor C&#8722;F activation was observed and [Eu(DippForm)2(thf)2] (10) was isolated. By contrast, Eu reacted with Bi(C6F5)3 and Ph2pzH or tBu2pzH in thf without C&#8722;F activation, to give [Eu(Ph2pz)2(thf)4] (11) and [Eu(tBu2pz)3(thf)2] (12) respectively, the oxidation state outcomes corresponding to that for use of [Ag(C6F5)(py)] in pyridine.

         <title>Label&#8208;Free Electrochemiluminescence Imaging of Single&#8208;Cell Adhesions by Using Bipolar Nanoelectrode Array</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 3, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A label&#8208;free method for fast and positive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) imaging of single cells by bipolar nanoelectrode array is proposed using oxygen as the electrochemical probe. The successful imaging is achieved by transient generation of difference in oxygen concentration over the nanoelectrodes covered with or without cells. Thus, cell morphology and adhesion strength can be imaged.







Abstract
A label&#8208;free and fast approach for positive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) imaging of single cells by bipolar nanoelectrode array is proposed. The reduction of oxygen at a platinized gold nanoelectrode array in a closed bipolar electrochemical system is coupled with an oxidative ECL process at the anodic side. For elevating the ECL imaging contrast of single cells, a driving voltage of &#8722;2.0&#8197;V is applied to in&#8197;situ generate oxygen confined beneath cells that is subsequently used for ECL imaging at 1.1&#8197;V. High oxygen concentration in the confined space resulting from steric hindrance generates prominent oxygen reduction current at the cathodic side and higher ECL intensity at the anodic side, allowing positive ECL imaging of the cells adhesion region with excellent contrast. Cell morphology and adhesion strength can be successfully imaged with high image acquisition rate. This approach opens a new avenue for label&#8208;free imaging of single cells.

The successful imaging is achieved by transient generation of difference in oxygen concentration over the nanoelectrodes covered with or without cells. Thus, cell morphology and adhesion strength can be imaged.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A label-free and fast approach for positive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) imaging of single cells by bipolar nanoelectrode array is proposed. The reduction of oxygen at a platinized gold nanoelectrode array in a closed bipolar electrochemical system is coupled with an oxidative ECL process at the anodic side. For elevating the ECL imaging contrast of single cells, a driving voltage of &#8722;2.0&#8197;V is applied to in&#8197;situ generate oxygen confined beneath cells that is subsequently used for ECL imaging at 1.1&#8197;V. High oxygen concentration in the confined space resulting from steric hindrance generates prominent oxygen reduction current at the cathodic side and higher ECL intensity at the anodic side, allowing positive ECL imaging of the cells adhesion region with excellent contrast. Cell morphology and adhesion strength can be successfully imaged with high image acquisition rate. This approach opens a new avenue for label-free imaging of single cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Joint Venture of Metal Cluster and Amphiphilic Cationic Minidendron Resulting in Near Infrared Emissive Lamellar Ionic Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 3, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guanidinium minidendrons bearing terminal aliphatic chains show a columnar liquid&#8208;crystalline behaviour once associated with chlorine anions, whereas they turned into layered phases when associated with phosphorescent octahedral molybdenum cluster dianions. The emission properties of the inorganic dyes are largely influenced by the minidendron chain length in these first&#8208;of&#8208;their&#8208;kind clustomesogens.







Abstract
Inorganic red&#8208;NIR emissive materials are particularly relevant in many fields like optoelectronic, bioimaging or solar cells. Benefiting from their emission in devices implies their integration in easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle materials like liquid crystals, whose long&#8208;range ordering and self&#8208;healing abilities could be exploited and influence emission. Herein, we present red&#8208;NIR emissive hybrid materials obtained with phosphorescent octahedral molybdenum cluster anions electrostatically associated with amphiphilic guanidinium minidendrons. Polarized optical microscopy and X&#8208;ray analysis show that while the minidendron chloride salts self&#8208;organize into columnar phases, their association with the dianionic metal cluster leads to layered phases. Steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved emission investigations demonstrate the influence of the minidendron alkyl chain length on the phosphorescence of the metal cluster core.

         <title>Base&#8208;Mediated Radical Borylation of Alkyl Sulfones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 3, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The utilization of inactivated alkyl sulfones as alkyl radical precursors in a base&#8208;mediated borylation reaction with B2neop2 is reported, allowing direct access to valuable alkyl boronate esters without further transesterification. This approach is scalable and is tolerant to a variety of functional groups and substrates including complex molecules.







Abstract
A practical and direct method was developed for the production of versatile alkyl boronate esters via transition metal&#8208;free borylation of primary and secondary alkyl sulfones. The key to the success of the strategy is the use of bis(neopentyl glycolato) diboron (B2neop2), with a stoichiometric amount of base as a promoter. The practicality and industrial potential of this protocol are highlighted by its wide functional group tolerance, the late&#8208;stage modification of complex compounds, no need for further transesterification, and operational simplicity. Radical clock, radical trap experiments, and EPR studies were conducted which show that the borylation process involves radical intermediates.

         <title>Dual Activation of Unsaturated Amides with Schwartz's Reagent: A Diastereoselective Access to Cyclopentanols and N,O&#8208;Dimethylcyclopentylhydroxylamines.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 3, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concomitant generation of a nucleophilic and an electrophilic site from unsaturated Weinreb amide by using Cp2Zr(H)Cl) as the unique reagent was developed to promote a cyclisation reaction. The access to trans&#8208;2&#8208;substituted cyclopentanols or cyclopentylhydroxylamines can be selectively driven by a judicious choice of the cyclisation promotor. An access to cis&#8208;3&#8208;substituted is also described.







Abstract
The diastereoselective access to cyclopentanols and N,O&#8208;dimethylcyclopentylhydroxylamines from 4&#8208;pentenoic acid&#8208;derived Weinreb amides is described. Based on the concomitant generation of both the nucleophilic and the electrophilic poles by hydrozirconation of the amide and the C=C double bond, the cyclisation may be tuned towards cyclopentanols or N,O&#8208;dimethylcyclopentylhydroxylamines depending on the ring&#8208;closure promotor. An extension to cis 3&#8208;substituted N,O&#8208;dimethylcyclohexylhydroxylamines is also presented.

         <title>Relationship Between Molecular Structure, Single crystal Packing and Self&#8208;Assembly Behavior: A Case Based on Pyrene Imide Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 3, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of n&#8208;type organic semiconductor materials based on pyrene imide were successfully synthesized. These materials showed different self&#8208;assembly morphologies with different conjugation degree or alkyl group. Single&#8208;crystal packing revealed that the change of molecular structure would affect certain crystal lattice parameter, such as intermolecular distance, which would further result in different self&#8208;assembly morphology.







Abstract
Development of new n&#8208;type one&#8208;dimensional (1D) self&#8208;assembly nanostructure and a clear understanding of the relationship between molecular structure and self&#8208;assembly behavior are important prerequisites for further designing and optimizing organic optoelectronic nanodevice. In this article, a series of n&#8208;type organic semiconductor materials based on pyrene imide were successfully synthesized through [4+2] cycloaddition reactions and their preliminary optical and electrochemical properties were studied. The simulated HOMO&#8208;LUMO bandgaps via DFT tallied with the experimental data well. The self&#8208;assembly of these materials showed needle or fiber&#8208;like morphologies, indicating that different conjugation degree or alkyl group had significant influence on their self&#8208;assembly behaviors. Furthermore, the single&#8208;crystal packing for these molecules were analyzed and it was found out that the changes of conjugated backbone and functional group would affect certain crystal lattice parameter significantly, such as the intermolecular packing distance and crystal size etc, which would further result in different self&#8208;assembly morphology.

         <title>Frontispiece: Design and Control of Perylene Supramolecular Polymers through Imide Substitutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 3, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aggregates of perylene diimides are prized for their stability, efficiency and versatility in a range of optoelectronic applications. Structural control can be achieved via the supramolecular polymerization of perylene diimides, where the morphology and function of aggregates is modulated by rational design of the perylene diimide monomers. This review examines how chemical substitution at the imide position of perylene diimides (which does not affect the parent chromophore's electronic structure) can be used to tune the morphology, H&#8208; or J&#8208; aggregation and mode of growth of perylene diimide supramolecular polymers. It also appraises the current state of the art for controlling the degree of aggregation in isodesmic, cooperative and anti&#8208;cooperative systems, and pinpoints the most promising routes and future challenges to achieving greater morphological control of these supramolecular constructs. Read more in the Review by C.&#8197;F.&#8197;J. Faul et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;11&#8197;ff.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aggregates of perylene&lt;/b&gt; diimides are prized for their stability, efficiency and versatility in a range of optoelectronic applications. Structural control can be achieved via the supramolecular polymerization of perylene diimides, where the morphology and function of aggregates is modulated by rational design of the perylene diimide monomers. This review examines how chemical substitution at the imide position of perylene diimides (which does not affect the parent chromophore's electronic structure) can be used to tune the morphology, H- or J- aggregation and mode of growth of perylene diimide supramolecular polymers. It also appraises the current state of the art for controlling the degree of aggregation in isodesmic, cooperative and anti-cooperative systems, and pinpoints the most promising routes and future challenges to achieving greater morphological control of these supramolecular constructs. Read more in the Review by C.&#8197;F.&#8197;J. Faul et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;11&#8197;ff.

         <title>Cover Feature: Prebiotically Plausible Autocatalytic Peptide Amyloids (Chem. Eur. J. 3/2022)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 3, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple amino acids activated by the volcanic gas carbonyl sulfide can condense into peptides that then spontaneously assemble into amyloids. This suggests a plausible prebiotic relevance of peptide amyloids and has led to the discovery that they can template sequence&#8208;selective, regioselective and stereoselective peptide synthesis. Depending on the environmental conditions, such amyloid templating can function in either complementary or self&#8208;replicating mode. More information can be found in the Research Article by R. Riek, J. Greenwald, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103841).

The Groebke&#8211;Blackburn&#8211;Bienaym&#233; three&#8208;component reaction (GBB&#8208;3CR) has contributed enormously to the progress of organic synthesis, medicinal chemistry, and materials science. Diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of skeletally diverse cyclophanyl&#8208;derived fused imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]heterocycles by one&#8208;pot GBB&#8208;3CR involving formyl&#8208;cyclophane components in combination with various aliphatic and aromatic isocyanides and heteroaromatic amidines gives a library of versatile cyclophanyl imidazoles ligands. These can be readily transformed to prepare N,C palladacycles by regioselective ortho&#8208;palladation. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S. Br&#228;se et&#8197;al.

         <title>Design and Control of Perylene Supramolecular Polymers through Imide Substitutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 3, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review covers design principles to control the structure of perylene diimide (PDI) supramolecular polymers (SMPs) by modifying their imide substituents. How specific designs have been adapted and expanded is discussed, and various strategies to create future PDI motifs for highly controlled, tailored SMPs are highlighted. A focus is put on thermodynamic and kinetic control over 1) morphology, 2) H&#8208; or J&#8208;aggregation, and 3) mechanisms of growth.







Abstract
The number and type of new supramolecular polymer (SMP) systems have increased rapidly in recent years. Some of the key challenges faced for these novel systems include gaining full control over the mode of self&#8208;assembly, the creation of novel architectures and exploring functionality. Here, we provide a critical overview of approaches related to perylene&#8208;based SMPs and discuss progress to exert control over these potentially important SMPs through chemical modification of the imide substituents. Imide substitutions affect self&#8208;assembly behaviour orthogonally to the intrinsic optoelectronic properties of the perylene core, making for a valuable approach to tune SMP properties. Several recent approaches are therefore highlighted, with a focus on controlling 1) morphology, 2) H&#8208; or J&#8208; aggregation, and 3) mechanism of growth and degree of aggregation using thermodynamic and kinetic control. Areas of potential future exploration and application of these functional SMPs are also explored.

         <title>Catechol Moiety Integrated Tri&#8208;Aryl Type AIEgen for Visual and Quantitative Boronic Acid Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 3, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double feature: Functional AIEgen TA&#8208;Catechol with dual&#8208;mode detection capability towards series of boronic acids is presented. Photoluminescent properties of TA&#8208;Catechol are studied thoroughly both experimentally and theoretically. Detection performance is estimated for visual and quantitative mode while formation of tetra&#8208;coordinated boronic compound is confirmed to dominate the sensing procedure. Solid&#8208;state recognition and potential applications are discussed.







Abstract
Novel functional AIEgen based on three compact bound aryl skeletons is designed and synthesized. This tri&#8208;aryl type luminogen (TA&#8208;Catechol) embedded with catechol moiety responds rapidly to series of boronic acids. Real&#8208;time visual and quantitative dual&#8208;mode detection method is established for the first time with modest precision and low detection limit (8.0&#8197;&#956;M). Detailed mechanistic discussion identifies tetra&#8208;coordinated boronic species as the key intermediate within sensing procedure. Wide range of organic boronic acids compatible with this strategy is displayed which is promising in high throughput screening technology. Furthermore, solid&#8208;state sensing capability of TA&#8208;Catechol is also demonstrated.

         <title>Acid&#8208;Tolerant Sulfate Tetrahedral Cages from Anion&#8208;Coordination&#8208;Driven Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 3, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
C3&#8208;symmetric tris&#8208;bis(urea) ligands L2 and L3 assemble with sulfate anions to give the first A4L4&#8208;type sulfate tetrahedral cages. The existence of A4L4 cages in solution is sensitive to the stoichiometry of the sulfate and internal guest; they can transform to A3L2 and A3L1 with increasing amounts of sulfate anion. Most noticeably, the A4L4 cages exhibit greater resistance to both Br&#248;nsted and Lewis acids than the corresponding phosphate cages.







Abstract
Supramolecular cages have been constructed by anion&#8208;coordination&#8208;driven assembly (ACDA) in recent years and have shown unique host&#8208;guest interactions. However, most of the reported cages are made of the phosphate ion (PO43&#8722;); other anions have rarely been explored. Here we show for the first time that the sulfate ion (SO42&#8722;) is also able to form the A4L4 tetrahedral motif with tris&#8208;bis(urea) ligands, but this is dependent on the stoichiometry of the sulfate ion (in solution). Notably, the sulfate cages display enhanced resistance for both Br&#248;nsted (pH as low as 4.3 in acetone containing 15&#8201;% water) and Lewis acids (metal complexes) compared to the corresponding phosphate cages, and thus could find applications where an acidic (proton or metals) environment is required.

         <title>Rational Design of Self&#8208;Assembled Mitochondria&#8208;Targeting Lytic Peptide Conjugates with Enhanced Tumor Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 3, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
To improve the tumor selectivity of membrane lytic peptides, a self&#8208;assembly strategy based on rational design of peptide conjugates has been developed. A hydrophobic triphenylphosphonium (TPP) group for mitochondria targeting and a hydrophilic arginine&#8208;glycine&#8208;aspartic acid (RGD) sequence targeting the integrin receptor have been incorporated to pH&#8208;responsive lytic peptides. The self&#8208;assembled nanoparticles are endocytosed selectively into the cancer cells, followed by the disruption of lysosomal and mitochondrial membranes, and lead to apoptotic cell death in the micromolar range.







Abstract
Membrane lytic peptides (MLP) are widely explored as cellular delivery vehicles or antitumor/antibacterial agents. However, the poor selectivity between cancer and normal cells slims their prospects as potential anti&#8208;tumor drugs. Herein, we have developed a rationally designed self&#8208;assembly strategy to enhance tumor selectivity of MLP&#8208;based conjugates, incorporating a hydrophobic triphenylphosphonium (TPP) group for mitochondria targeting, and a hydrophilic arginine&#8208;glycine&#8208;aspartic acid (RGD) sequence targeting integrins. The self&#8208;assembly nanoparticles can enhance the stability of the peptides in&#8197;vitro plasma and be endocytosed selectively into the cancer cells. The histidine&#8208;rich lytic peptide component assists the disruption of endosomal/lysosomal membranes and subsequent the mitochondria membrane, which leads to apoptosis. This rational design of MLP&#8208;based conjugates provides a practical strategy to increase the application prospects of lytic peptides in cancer treatment.

         <title>DEB&#8208;FAPy&#8208;dG Adducts of 1,3&#8208;Butadiene: Synthesis, Structural Characterization, and Formation in 1,2,3,4&#8208;Diepoxybutane Treated DNA**

Formamidopyrimidnes (FAPy) are highly mutagenic DNA lesions. Here we describe the first synthesis and complete structural characterization of a diepoxybutane (DEB) derived formamidopyrimidine of dG (DEB&#8208;FAPy&#8208;dG). An isotope dilution nanoLC&#8208;ESI+&#8208;HRMS/MS method was developed and DEB&#8208;FAPy&#8208;dG adducts were detected in DEB treated DNA.







Abstract
Metabolic activation of the human carcinogen 1,3&#8208;butadiene (BD) by cytochrome 450 monooxygenases gives rise to a genotoxic diepoxide, 1,2,3,4&#8208;diepoxybutane (DEB). This reactive electrophile alkylates guanine bases in DNA to produce N7&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3,4&#8208;epoxy&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;dG (N7&#8208;DE&#8208;dG) adducts. Because of the positive charge at the N7 position of the purine heterocycle, N7&#8208;DEB&#8208;dG adducts are inherently unstable and can undergo spontaneous depurination or base&#8208;catalyzed imidazole ring opening to give N6&#8208;[2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;erythro&#8208;pentofuranosyl]&#8208;2,6&#8208;diamino&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4&#8208;oxo&#8208;5&#8208;N&#8208;1&#8208;(oxiran&#8208;2&#8208;yl)propan&#8208;1&#8208;ol&#8208;formamidopyrimidine (DEB&#8208;FAPy&#8208;dG) adducts. Here we report the first synthesis and structural characterization of DEB&#8208;FAPy&#8208;dG adducts. Authentic standards of DEB&#8208;FAPy&#8208;dG and its 15N3&#8208;labeled analogue were used for the development of a quantitative nanoLC&#8208;ESI+&#8208;HRMS/MS method, allowing for adduct detection in DEB&#8208;treated calf thymus DNA. DEB&#8208;FAPy&#8208;dG formation in DNA was dependent on DEB concentration and pH, with higher numbers observed under alkaline conditions.

N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complex of Pd was embedded in dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticle support for achieving confined Suzuki polymerization of a variety of monomer combinations to produce rich structural patterned conjugated polymers with narrow molecular weight distribution and high solubility and processibility in common organic solvents.







Abstract
A catalytic heterogenous Suzuki polymerization method was developed by confining the Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed cross coupling reactions to take place exclusively in the nanochannels of dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles. Conjugated polymers with various monomer combinations, including donor&#8208;acceptor structures, were obtained in high yields. The molecular weights of the obtained polymers were well controlled with narrow molecular weight distributions (PDI value down to 1.13). All the polymeric products were highly soluble in common organic solvents, granting them with high processability. All the features of this confined Suzuki polymerization method endow the conjugated polymers great potential in optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Polymers with Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A summary of recent progress aims at the achievements of efficient room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence emission with stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior. The stimuli&#8208;responsive factors are composed of light, oxygen, temperature, mechanical force and pH. The relationship between luminescent property and stimuli&#8208;responsive mechanism is discussed in detail, and promising opportunities and existing challenges are presented as a guideline for future research in this area.







Abstract
Taking advantages of the impressing behaviors of room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP), the explorations in RTP materials are not only limited to efficient emission and ultralong lifetime of phosphorescence. The discovery and creation of stimuli&#8208;responsive properties have become the major pursuit, which will lay a solid foundation for future applications in RTP materials. Based on this, a review centered on recent progress of stimuli&#8208;responsive RTP materials is summarized to show frontier development in polymer systems. Different kinds of stimuli&#8208;responsive factors including light, oxygen, temperature, mechanical force and pH regulations are investigated in this review. Many potential applications and promising strategies are deeply discussed with the hope to assist future studies in this area.

         <title>Structural and Electronic Properties of Boranes Containing Boron&#8208;Chalcogen Multiple Bonds and Stabilized by&#160;Amido Imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;imine Ligands</title>

         <dc:description>The stabilization of elusive monomeric species containing multiple boron&#8208;chalcogen bonds has motivated the investigation of sophisticated ligand systems in the past few years. Recently, a series of neutral, Lewis acid&#8208;free chalcogenboranes were prepared by incorporation of an amido imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;imine as the supporting ligand (  Frank et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2021, 60, 4633  ), resulting in well&#8208;defined molecular entities with pronounced multiple bond character, B=X (X = O, S, Se, Te). In view of the potential use of N&#8208;heterocyclic boranes (NHB=X) as ligands in catalysis and fine chemistry, we evaluated in this work the bonding properties of the new B=X compounds based on a&#160;&#960;&#8208;backdonation model. The electronic properties of systems in question were modulated via systematic modifications of the NHB ring with respect to ligand variation, saturation, size, and heteroatom substitutions. Investigations on the B=X bond length and order, calculated by means of density functional theory methods, reveal enhanced B=X bonding properties for NHB rings with high electron delocalization in the NHB ring and bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents; a fact that was also confirmed by computational assessment of electron interactions of the B=X species with a dicarbonyl manganese complex. We expect that the analysis will contribute to the rational optimization of existing ligands as well as the development of new moieties, which would further allow for exploration of new boron chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Add a Pinch of Tetrel: The Transformation of a Centrosymmetric Metal into a Nonsymmorphic and Chiral Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The substitution of a small amount of silicon to the known composition of RhP3 (centrosymmetric space group Im
) yields novel RhSi0.3P2.7 (space group P212121) which has a noncentrosymmetric, nonsymmorphic, and chiral crystal structure. We hypothesize that a combination of M&#8722;Tt and M&#8722;Pn bonding favors noncentrosymmetric structures. Therefore, by adding a &#8220;pinch&#8221; of tetrel to known centrosymmetric metal pnictide compositions, new noncentrosymmetric structures may be realized.







Abstract
Centrosymmetric skutterudite RhP3 was converted to a nonsymmorphic and chiral compound RhSi0.3P2.7 (space group P212121) by means of partial replacement of Si for P. The structure, determined by a combination of X&#8208;ray crystallography and solid state 31P&#8197;NMR, exhibits branched polyanionic P/Si chains that are unique among metal phosphides. A driving force to stabilize the locally noncentrosymmetric cis&#8208;RhSi2P4 and fac&#8208;RhSi3P3 fragments is &#960;&#8208;electron back&#8208;donation between the Rh t2g&#8208;type orbitals and the unoccupied antibonding Si/P orbitals, which is more effective for Si than for P. In situ studies and total energy calculations revealed the metastable nature of RhSi0.3P2.7. Electronic structure calculations predicted centrosymmetric cubic RhP3 to be metallic which was confirmed by transport properties measurements. In contrast, the electronic structure for chiral orthorhombic RhSi0.3P2.7 contained a bandgap, and this compound was shown to be a narrow gap semiconductor.

         <title>Spin States, Bonding and Magnetism in Mixed&#8208;Valence Iron(0)&#8208;Iron(II) Complexes**
</title>

         <dc:description>
The nature of metal&#8208;metal bonding between two different kinds of metal sites is essential for understanding these &#8220;xenophilic&#8221; complexes. We used M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, SQUID magnetometry and computational analysis on a pair of related diiron complexes; they indicated that the bond order is roughly one&#8208;half. The best electronic structure description is LFeII&#8722;Fe0(CO)2Cp, in which the Fe(CO)2Cp is low&#8208;spin iron(0) and acts as an X&#8208;type ligand toward the high&#8208;spin iron(II) of the LFe fragment.







Abstract
&#8220;Xenophilic&#8221; complexes offer metal&#8208;metal bonds between disparate metal sites, but the nature of the metal&#8208;metal bonding is often unclear. Here, we describe two novel complexes with unsupported Fe&#8722;Fe bonds, LxFe&#8722;Fp (LX = &#946;&#8208;aldiminate or &#946;&#8208;diketiminate; Fp = Fe(CO)2Cp), that offer insight into Fe&#8722;Fe bonding. M&#246;ssbauer, magnetism, and DFT analysis indicate that the most accurate electronic structure description is LFeII&#8592;Fe0(CO)2Cp, in which the Fe(CO)2Cp is low&#8208;spin iron(0) and acts as an X&#8208;type ligand toward the high&#8208;spin iron(II) of the LFe fragment. This largely electrostatic interaction has a bond order of only 0.5. The three&#8208;coordinate high&#8208;spin iron(II) site has large zero&#8208;field splitting, and in addition its M&#246;ssbauer parameters can be used to rank the Fp&#8722; &#8220;metalloligand&#8221; as a donor; it is nearly as strong a donor as phosphides and alkyls.

         <title>Doubly&#8208;Reduced Pentacene in Different Coordination Environments: X&#8208;ray Crystallographic and Theoretical Insights into Structural and Electronic Changes</title>

         <dc:description>
Chemical reduction of pentacene with alkali metals ranging from Li to Cs readily affords the doubly&#8208;reduced anion that shows different binding preference for the lightest Li+ ion vs. heavier Group 1 congeners. DFT calculations provide full support for the X&#8208;ray crystallographic data by following changes in aromaticity and electronic structure of pentacene upon reduction.







Abstract
Chemical reduction of pentacene (C22H14, 1) with Group 1 metals ranging from Li to Cs revealed that 1 readily undergoes a two&#8208;fold reduction to afford a doubly&#8208;reduced 12&#8722; anion in THF. With the help of 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 ether used as a secondary coordinating agent, five &#960;&#8208;complexes of 12&#8722; with different alkali metal counterions have been isolated and fully characterized. This series of complexes enables the first evaluation of alkali&#8208;metal ion binding patterns and structural changes of the 12&#8722; dianion based on the crystallographically confirmed examples. The difference in coordination of the smallest Li+ ion vs. heavier Group 1 congeners has been demonstrated. In addition, the use of benzo&#8208;15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 in the reaction of 1 with Na metal allowed the isolation of the unique solvent&#8208;separated ion product with a &#8220;naked&#8221; dianion, 12&#8722;. The detailed structural analyses of the series revealed the C&#8722;C bond alteration and core deformation of pentacene upon two&#8208;fold reduction and complexation. The negative charge localization at the central six&#8208;membered ring of 12&#8722; identified by theoretical calculations corroborates with the X&#8208;ray crystallographic results. Subsequent in&#8208;depth theoretical analysis provided a detailed description of changes in the electronic structure and aromaticity of pentacene upon reduction.

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Amino&#8208;iso&#8208;Butyric Acid Foldamers Terminated with Rhodium(I) N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysts</title>

Another twist: &#945;&#8208;Amino&#8208;iso&#8208;butyric acid foldamers terminated with rhodium(I) N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complexes have been shown to possess point, helical and axial chirality. Communication from chiral residues at the N&#8208;termini of these 1&#8197;nm long foldamers to rhodium(I) complexes at the C&#8208;termini led to unequal ratios of diastereoisomers, although this did not alter the stereoselectivity of hydrosilylation reactions catalyzed by these foldamers.







Abstract
To investigate how remotely induced changes in ligand folding might affect catalysis by organometallic complexes, dynamic &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;iso&#8208;butyric acid (Aib) peptide foldamers bearing rhodium(I) N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes have been synthesized and studied. X&#8208;ray crystallography of a foldamer with an N&#8208;terminal azide and a C&#8208;terminal Rh(NHC)(Cl)(diene) complex showed a racemate with a chiral axis in the Rh(NHC) complex and a distorted 310 helical body. Replacing the azide with either one or two chiral L&#8208;&#945;&#8208;methylvaline (L&#8208;&#945;MeVal) residues gave diastereoisomeric foldamers that each possessed point, helical and axial chirality. NMR spectroscopy revealed an unequal ratio of diastereoisomers for some foldamers, indicating that the chiral conformational preference of the N&#8208;terminal residue(s) was relayed down the 1&#8197;nm helical body to the axially chiral Rh(NHC) complex. Although the remote chiral residue(s) did not affect the stereoselectivity of hydrosilylation reactions catalysed by these foldamers, these studies suggest a potential pathway towards remote conformational control of organometallic catalysts.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) possess evenly dispersed atomic active centers and well&#8208;defined coordination structure, which provide high enzyme catalytic activity, and clear experimental model for mechanism study. Hence, the enhanced antitumor therapeutic approaches by utilizing tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive enzyme activities of SAzymes are revealed. And the corresponding therapeutic mechanisms are also analyzed.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) with specific response to the unique tumor microenvironment (TME) feature providing 100&#8201;% metal atoms utilization for high&#8208;efficient enzyme&#8208;catalyzed therapy and accurate template for the study of therapeutic mechanisms. In this review, we first introduce the various synthetic strategies of SAzymes, and the TME&#8208;responsive SAzymes activities. Next, the TME&#8208;responsive enhanced antitumor therapeutic approaches based on the enzymatic activities of SAzymes are summarized, and the corresponding therapy mechanisms are elaborated. Subsequently, a concise but concentrated summary, and the challenges and opportunities for the future design and engineering of SAzyme are outlined. As a new discipline, SAzymes have vast space for development in enhanced antitumor therapy. This timely review provides guidance and constructive suggestions for the future of SAzymes.

         <title>Tuning Peptide Structure and Function through Fluorobenzene Stapling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalyst&#8208;free peptide stapling method based on SNAr reactions of fluorobenzene derivatives led to a library of constrained cyclic peptides with a controlled ortho, meta or para relationship between two cysteine residues. The method is compatible with solid&#8208;phase synthesis by which a single linear peptide can be cyclized with different degrees of constraint. New potent agonists of melanocortin receptors were synthesized by using this method, and the effect of the cyclization on the secondary structure was studied by NMR and CD spectroscopy.







Abstract
Cyclic peptides are promising next&#8208;generation therapeutics with improved biological stability and activity. A catalyst&#8208;free stapling method for cysteine&#8208;containing peptides has been developed that enables fine&#8208;tuning of the macrocycle by using the appropriate regioisomers of fluorobenzene linkers. Stapling was performed on the unprotected linear peptide or, more conveniently, directly on&#8208;resin after peptide synthesis. NMR spectroscopy and circular dichroism studies demonstrate that the type of stapling can tune the secondary structures of the peptides. The method was applied to a set of potential agonists for melanocortin receptors, generating a library of macrocyclic potent ligands with ortho, meta or para relationships between the thioethers. Their small but significant differences in potency and efficacy demonstrate how the method allows facile fine&#8208;tuning of macrocyclic peptides towards biological targets from the same linear precursor.

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Leading to White Light Emission in Diphenylbenzofulvene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Even though the aggregation&#8208;induced emission phenomena have been described for diphenylbenzofulvene derivatives for about 15&#8197;years, their solid&#8208;state emission in films has not been previously studied. Hereby, their solid&#8208;state emission is characterized and the white light emission of a thin film made of mixture of the derivatives DPBFMe and DPMF(Me)2 is deciphered.







Abstract
The search for a unique molecular system able to efficiently emit in the total visible range of the electromagnetic spectra, i.&#8201;e., white light emission (WLE), is a topic of intense research. We here show that aggregates formed by diphenylbenzofulvene (DPBF) derivatives are from two to four orders of magnitude more emissive than their monomers. From a simple strategy, involving structural modification of a DPBF propelled shape core, a close match with the pure white light emission coordinates is obtained with a combination of two derivatives in films, with featured solid&#8208;state emission, without involvement of D&#8722;A groups or energy transfer processes.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Even though&lt;/b&gt; the aggregation-induced emission phenomena have been described for diphenylbenzofulvene derivatives for about 15&#8197;years, their solid-state emission in films has not been previously studied. Hereby, their solid-state emission is characterized and the white light emission of a thin film made of mixture of the derivatives &lt;b&gt;DPBFMe&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;DPMF(Me)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; is deciphered.

         <title>MOF&#8208;Stabilized Perfluorinated Palladium Cages Catalyze the Additive&#8208;Free Aerobic Oxidation of Aliphatic Alcohols to Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorinated pyridine&#8208;Pd2+ coordinate cages have been synthesized and characterized with atomic resolution within the channels of a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), and used as catalysts during the aerobic oxidation of aliphatic alcohols to carboxylic acids without any additive. These results illustrate a rare example of stable per&#8208;fluorinated cationic metal complex, with potential implications in the future design of catalytic organometallic complexes.







Abstract
Extremely high electrophilic metal complexes, composed by a metal cation and very electron poor &#963;&#8208;donor ancillary ligands, are expected to be privileged catalysts for oxidation reactions in organic chemistry. However, their low lifetime prevents any use in catalysis. Here we show the synthesis of fluorinated pyridine&#8208;Pd2+ coordinate cages within the channels of an anionic tridimensional metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), and their use as efficient metal catalysts for the aerobic oxidation of aliphatic alcohols to carboxylic acids without any additive. Mechanistic studies strongly support that the MOF&#8208;stabilized coordination cage with perfluorinated ligands unleashes the full electrophilic potential of Pd2+ to dehydrogenate primary alcohols, without any base, and also to activate O2 for the radical oxidation to the aldehyde intermediate. This study opens the door to design catalytic perfluorinated complexes for challenging organic transformations, where an extremely high electrophilic metal site is required.

         <title>Molecular Design Strategy for Orange Red Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters in Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes (OLEDs)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this comprehensive review, orange red thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters are discussed in detail based on various molecular designs. The heteroaromatic&#8208;type emitters possessing high rigid core reveal better efficiency enhancement compared to low rigid cores. Moreover, this review focuses on how to achieve high color purity in orange red emitters while maintaining good OLED device performances.







Abstract
Pure organic molecules based thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters have been successfully developed in recent years for their propitious application in highly efficient organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). In the case of orange red emitters, the non&#8208;radiative process is known to be a serious issue due to its lower lying singlet energy level. However, recent studies indicate that there are tremendous efforts put to develop efficient orange red TADF emitters. In addition, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of heteroaromatic based orange red TADF OLEDs surpassed 30&#8201;%. Such heteroaromatic type emitters showed wide emission spectra; therefore, more attention is being paid to develop highly efficient orange red TADF emitters along with good color purity. Herein, the recent progress of orange red TADF emitters based on molecular structures, such as cyanobenzene, heteroaromatic, naphthalimide, and boron&#8208;based acceptors, are reviewed. Further, our insight on these acceptors has been provided by their photophysical studies and device performances. Future perspectives of orange red TADF emitters for real practical applications are discussed.

         <title>Chemically Synthesized, Self&#8208;Assembling Small Interfering RNA&#8208;Prohead RNA Molecules Trigger Dicer&#8208;Independent Gene Silencing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chimeric molecules fusing small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes to prohead RNA (pRNA) three&#8208;way junctions (3WJs) were designed. The siRNA&#8208;3WJs self&#8208;assembled in&#8197;vitro. siRNA&#8208;3WJs transfected into Dicer&#8208;deficient cell lines triggered potent gene silencing. siRNA&#8208;3WJs are most efficient when the antisense strand of the siRNA duplex is positioned 5&#8242; of the 3WJ (5&#8242;&#8208;siRNA&#8208;3WJ) relative to 3&#8242; of the 3WJ (3&#8242;&#8208;siRNA&#8208;3WJ).







Abstract
RNA interference (RNAi) mediated by small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes is a powerful therapeutic modality, but the translation of siRNAs from the bench into clinical application has been hampered by inefficient delivery in&#8197;vivo. An innovative delivery strategy involves fusing siRNAs to a three&#8208;way junction (3WJ) motif derived from the phi29 bacteriophage prohead RNA (pRNA). Chimeric siRNA&#8208;3WJ molecules are presumed to enter the RNAi pathway through Dicer cleavage. Here, we fused siRNAs to the phi29 3WJ and two phylogenetically related 3WJs. We confirmed that the siRNA&#8208;3WJs are substrates for Dicer in&#8197;vitro. However, our results reveal that siRNA&#8208;3WJs transfected into Dicer&#8208;deficient cell lines trigger potent gene silencing. Interestingly, siRNA&#8208;3WJs transfected into an Argonaute 2&#8208;deficient cell line also retain some gene silencing activity. siRNA&#8208;3WJs are most efficient when the antisense strand of the siRNA duplex is positioned 5&#8242; of the 3WJ (5&#8242;&#8208;siRNA&#8208;3WJ) relative to 3&#8242; of the 3WJ (3&#8242;&#8208;siRNA&#8208;3WJ). This work sheds light on the functional properties of siRNA&#8208;3WJs and offers a design rule for maximizing their potency in the human RNAi pathway.

         <dc:description>
Nanoscale particles (NPs) are ubiquitous in our daily life, ranging from ambient particulate matter, microplastics to theranostic nanoparticles. Recent research endeavors in laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (LDI&#8208;MSI) have enriched the toolbox for evaluation of NPs&#8217; behaviors in biological tissues. Practical applications of LDI MSI for NPs have been verified in sub&#8208;organ bio&#8208;distribution, drug release evaluation and surface chemical analysis. Here we summarized previous studies in anticipation of more innovations in this field.







Abstract
Understanding the fate of nanoscale particles (NPs) in biological systems is significant with the increasing risk for human exposure. Recent research endeavors in laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (LDI&#8208;MSI) have enriched the toolbox for evaluation of NPs&#8217; behavior in biological tissues, especially in aspects including sub&#8208;organ bio&#8208;distribution, clearance, quantification and surface chemistry variation analysis. In recognition of the potential for advancement in LDI MSI, this concept provides a brief overview of recent research works in LDI MSI for NPs, illustrates new applications that demonstrate the superiority of this technique, and highlights a series of perspectives and directions to move the field forward.

         <title>Cu2O/CeO2 Photo&#8208;electrochemical Water Splitting: A Nanocomposite with an Efficient Interfacial Transmission Path under the Co&#8208;action of a p&#8211;n Heterojunction and Micro&#8208;mesocrystals</title>

Improving your PECs: A Cu2O/CeO2 composite with a unique structure has been fabricated, in which a p&#8211;n heterojunction and a micro&#8208;mesocrystal (m&#8208;MC) structure work together. Under their synergistic effect, an optimal Cu2O/CeO2 photocathode provides a decisive pathway for the rapid separation and transfer of electron&#8211;holes, thereby facilitating the separation/transfer of carriers. As a result, the optimal Cu2O/CeO2 shows the best photo&#8208;electrochemical (PEC) water splitting performance and excellent stability.







Abstract
Cu2O is an ideal p&#8208;type material for photo&#8208;electrochemical (PEC) hydrogen evolution, although serious electron&#8211;hole recombination and photocorrosion restrict its further improvement for PEC activity. In this work, CeO2 nanoparticles (NPs) self&#8208;assemble on the surface of Cu2O octahedra, thus successfully forming a Cu2O/CeO2 structure in which p&#8211;n heterojunctions and micro&#8208;mesocrystals (m&#8208;MCs) work together. The optimum Cu2O/CeO2 composite, without the use of any cocatalyst, exhibits a fivefold higher photocurrent density (4.63&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0&#8197;V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode) than that of Cu2O octahedra, which is better than most Cu2O&#8208;based photocathodes without cocatalyst and even comparable with advanced Cu2O&#8208;based photocathodes. The hydrogen production of the optimal Cu2O/CeO2 (Faradaic efficiency of &#8764;100&#8201;%) is 17.5&#8197;times higher than that of pure Cu2O octahedra, and the photocurrent shows almost no decay under the 12&#8197;h stability test. The delicately designed Cu2O/CeO2 structure in this work provides reference and inspiration for the design of cathodes materials.

         <title>Light&#8208;Assisted Ullmann Coupling of Phenols and Aryl Halides: The Synergetic Effect Between Plasmonic Copper Nanoparticles and Carbon Nanotubes from Various Sources</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, plasmonic copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) were loaded onto carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from various sources including commercial CNTs and those directly derived from plastic wastes. Under visible&#8208;light irradiation, the synergetic effect between Cu NPs and CNTs could efficiently promote Ullmann coupling of phenols and aryl halides, achieving high yields of diaryl ethers.







Abstract
Utilizing light and plastic wastes as resources to turn the wasted phenols and hazardous aryl halides into value added chemicals seems to be an attractive idea for alleviating the energy crisis and environmental problems. In this work, plasmonic copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) were loaded onto carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from various sources including commercial CNTs and those derived from plastic wastes. Under visible&#8208;light irradiation, the catalyst could efficiently convert phenols and aryl halides to diaryl ethers. Similar with commercial CNTs, excellent activity is also achieved when utilizing CNTs derived from different kinds of plastic wastes as support for the system. Further investigation shows that the visible&#8208;light irradiation and light&#8208;excited plasmonic Cu NPs are necessary to inhibit the phenol degradation on CNTs and in turn promote the cross&#8208;coupling of phenol and aryl halides. Compared with metal oxides and other carbon materials, the excellent capability of CNTs to absorb light, to convert light to heat, and to adsorb both two reactants simultaneously are critical to enhance the activity of Cu NPs, achieving high yields of diaryl ethers. This study could provide a novel strategy for catalyst design and generate a more economically sustainable process.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Mediated Glycosylation with Thioglycosides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methods for thioglycoside activation that rely on transition metal catalysis is summarized in this review.







Abstract
Thioglycosides are among the most common glycosyl donors that find broad application in the synthesis of glycans and glycoconjugates. However, the requirement for toxic and/or large access of activators needed for common glycosylations with thioglycosides remains a notable drawback. Due to the increased awareness of the chemical waste impact on the environment, synthetic studies have been driven by the goal of finding non&#8208;toxic reagents. The main focus of this review is to highlight recent methods for thioglycoside activation that rely on transition metal catalysis.

Abstract
The one&#8208;electron reduction of indeno[2,1&#8208;a]fluorene&#8208;11,12&#8208;dione (IF) with various alkali metals prepare the radical anion salts. The data about different structures, properties, and characterization was obtained by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) measurements, and physical property measurement system (PPMS). Compound IF.&#8722;K+(18&#8208;c&#8208;6) is regarded as a one&#8208;dimensional magnetic chain through C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C interaction. Theoretical calculations and magnetic results showed that [IF.&#8722;K+(15&#8208;c&#8208;5)]2 is a dimer with an open&#8208;shell ground state. Compounds IF.&#8722;Na+(15&#8208;c&#8208;5) and IF.&#8722;K+(cryptand) are monoradical anion salts: IF2.&#8722;Li+ possesses unique &#960;&#8208;stack structure with an interplanar separation less than 3.46&#8197;&#197;, making it a semiconductor (&#948;RT=1.9&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;1). This work gives insights into multifunctional radical anions, and describes the design and development of different functional radicals.

         <title>Tunable Surface Electric Field of Electrocatalysts via Constructing Schottky Heterojunctions for Selective Conversion of Trash Ions to Treasures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conceptually new method is proposed to tune the surface electric field of electrocatalysts by adjusting the number and density of heterojunctions inside. The well&#8208;designed surface electric field of an electrocatalyst plays a key role in facilitating pre&#8208;adsorption and/or activation of reactants for selective conversion of trash ions to useful products.







Abstract
Surface electric field of catalyst is widely recognized as one of the key points to boost catalytic activity. However, there is still a lack of convenient ways to tune the surface electric field to selectively boost the catalytic conversions of different types of reactants in specific catalytic reactions. Here, we introduce a conceptually new method to tune the surface electric field of electrode materials by adjusting the number and density of heterojunctions inside. Both theoretical and experimental results prove that the well&#8208;designed surface electric field of an electrocatalyst plays a key role in facilitating pre&#8208;adsorption and/or activation of reactants for selective conversion of trash ions to useful products in hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions as well as NOx&#8722; reduction reactions.

         <title>Pd(II)&#8208;Mediated C&#8722;H Activation for Cysteine Bioconjugation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Out of the box: A highly efficient bioconjugation strategy is reported utilising Pd(II) complexes prepared via C&#8722;H activation, which enable selective S&#8208;arylation of cysteine. These C&#8722;H activation complexes were prepared using common Pd(II) sources and without the need for a glovebox. A wide substrate scope is enabled by in&#8197;situ generation of these complexes, which produce excellent conversions of a model tripeptide and are able to arylate surface cysteine on an intact protein.







Abstract
Selective bioconjugation remains a significant challenge for the synthetic chemist due to the stringent reaction conditions required by biomolecules coupled with their high degree of functionality. The current trailblazer of transition&#8208;metal mediated bioconjugation chemistry involves the use of Pd(II) complexes prepared via an oxidative addition process. Herein, the preparation of Pd(II) complexes for cysteine bioconjugation via a facile C&#8722;H activation process is reported. These complexes show bioconjugation efficiency competitive with what is seen in the current literature, with a user&#8208;friendly synthesis, common Pd(II) sources, and a more cost&#8208;effective ligand. Furthermore, these complexes need not be isolated, and still achieve high conversion efficiency and selectivity of a model peptide. These complexes also demonstrate the ability to selectively arylate a single surface cysteine residue on a model protein substrate, further demonstrating their utility.

para&#8208;Alkynylated aromatic amines are obtained without the need to prefunctionalize the starting aniline by Pd/S,O&#8208;ligand catalyzed C&#8722;H alkynylation reactions.







Abstract
Herein, we report a nondirected para&#8208;selective C&#8722;H alkynylation of aniline derivatives by a Pd/S,O&#8208;ligand&#8208;based catalyst. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions and is compatible with a variety of substituted anilines. The scalability and further derivatizations of the alkynylated products have been also demonstrated.

         <dc:description>
A new anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 compound, developed in this joint study, is shown in front of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 viruses. The ongoing pandemic of human SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infections (COVID&#8208;19) creates a high demand for antiviral drug development. The shown quinoline&#8211;morpholine hybrid and other new quinoline&#8208;based compounds were synthesized and investigated for their in vitro activity against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. They exerted an anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 activity similar to or stronger than that of the reference drug. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Marschall, S.&#8197;B. Tsogoeva et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103861).

A simple, radially arranged, highly anthracene congested 1,2,3&#8208;tri(9&#8208;anthryl)benzene has been synthesized in a Negishi coupling reaction with a PdI catalyst. This beautiful three&#8208;anthracene clustered structure shows unique behavior in both the solid and excited states, but work is still in progress. There are three more anthracenes on the wooden desk for construction of the final target: hexa(9&#8208;anthryl)benzene. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Nishiuchi, H. Sotome, K. Shimizu, H. Miyasaka, and T. Kubo (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104245).

         <title>BOPHY&#8208;Fullerene C60 Dyad as a Photosensitizer for Antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free BOPHY&#8208;based photosensitizer (PS) has been obtained as a mixture of two atropisomers. The BOPHY core works as a visible light&#8208;harvesting center and donor antenna, while a fullerene C60 acceptor acts as an effective spin converter and triggers photodynamic action. The dyad is capable of producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) by both photodynamic mechanisms. In&#8208;vitro studies indicate that the dyad photokills microorganisms after visible light irradiation. More information can be found in the Research Article by D.&#8197;A. Heredia et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103884).

The dyad is capable of producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) by both photodynamic mechanisms. In-vitro studies indicate that the dyad photokills microorganisms after visible light irradiation. More information can be found in the Research Article by D.&#8197;A. Heredia et&#8197;al. (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202103884"&gt;10.1002/chem.202103884&lt;/a&gt;).

         <title>Spectroscopic and Crystallographic Characterization of the R3N+&#8722;C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X Interaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite recent studies that have demonstrated the importance of R3N+&#8722;C&#8722;H hydrogen bonds in synthesis, biology and medicine, these noncovalent interactions remain undercharacterized. Herein, we present crystallographic, computational and for the first time, spectroscopic evidence for these weak hydrogen bonds.







Abstract
As appreciation for nonclassical hydrogen bonds has progressively increased, so have efforts to characterize these interesting interactions. Whereas several kinds of C&#8722;H hydrogen bonds have been well&#8208;studied, much less is known about the R3N+&#8722;C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X variety. Herein, we present crystallographic and spectroscopic evidence for the existence of these interactions, with special relevance to Selectfluor chemistry. Of particular note is the propensity for Lewis bases to engage in nonclassical hydrogen bonding over halogen bonding with the electrophilic F atom of Selectfluor. Further, the first examples of 1H NMR experiments detailing R3N+&#8722;C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X (X=O, N) hydrogen bonds are described.

         <title>Tuning the (Chir)optical Properties and Squeezing out the Inherent Chirality in Polyphenylene&#8208;Locked Helical Carbon Nanorings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Distorting linear polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) out of planarity affects their physical properties and breaks their symmetry to induce inherent chirality. However, the chirality cannot be achieved in large distorted PAHs&#8208;based macrocycles due to low racemization barrier for isomerization. Herein we report the precise synthesis and tuning size&#8208;dependent (chir)optical properties of a new class of chiral PAHs&#8208;containing conjugated macrocycles (cyclo[n]paraphenylene&#8208;2,6&#8208;anthrylene, [n]CPPAn2,6; n = 6&#8208;8). Their inherent chiralities were squeezed out in small anthrylene&#8208;based macrocycles. Efficient resolutions for chiral enantiomers with (P)/(M)&#8208;helicity of small [6&#8208;7]CPPAns were achieved by HPLC. Interestingly, these macrocycles showed enriched size&#8208;dependent physical, chiral, and (chir)optical properties. Theoretical calculations indicate that these macrocycles have high strain energy (Estrain = 60.8 to 73.4 kcal/mol) and very small Egap (~3.0 eV). Notably, these enantiomers showed strong chiroptical properties and dissymmetry factors (|gabs| and |glum| ~0.01 for an enantiomer of [6]CPPAn2,6), which can give them potential applications in optically active materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Cationic Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Decarbonylative Aryl Addition of Aromatic Aldehydes to Bicyclic Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report an unprecedented catalytic protocol for the enantioselective decarbonylative transformation of aryl aldehydes. In this process, the decarbonylation of aldehydes catalyzed by chiral iridium complexes enable the formation of asymmetric C&#8211;C bonds&#160; via &#160;the formation of an aryl&#8208;iridium intermediate. The decarbonylative aryl addition to bicyclic alkenes was fluidly performed without using a stoichiometric aryl&#8208;metal reagent, such as aryl boronic acid, with a cationic iridium complex generated in situ from Ir(cod)2(BArF4) and the sulfur&#8208;linked bis(phosphoramidite) ligand ((R,R)&#8208;S&#8208;Me&#8208;BIPAM). This reaction has broad functional group compatibility, and no waste is generated, except carbon monoxide.</dc:description>

         <title>The Potential of Micellar Media in the Synthesis of DNA&#8208;Encoded Libraries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA&#8208;encoded library (DEL) technology has become widely used in drug discovery research. The construction of DELs require robust organic transformations which proceed in aqueous media under mild conditions. Unfortunately, the application of water as reaction media for organic synthesis is not evident due to generally limited solubility of organic reagents. However, the use of surfactants can offer a solution to this issue. Oil&#8208;in&#8208;water microemulsions formed by surfactant micelles are able localize hydrophobic reagents inside them, resulting in high local concentration of the organic substances in an otherwise poorly solvated environment. This review provides a conceptual and critical summary of micellar synthesis possibilities that are well&#8208;suited for DEL synthesis. Existing examples on micellar DEL approaches, together with a selection of micellar organic transformations fundamentally suitable for DEL are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Inverse&#8208;tunable Red Luminescence and Electronic Properties of Nitridoberylloaluminates Sr2&#8208;xBax[BeAl3N5]:Eu2+ (x = 0&#8722;2)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The nitridoberylloaluminate Ba  2  [BeAl  3  N  5  ]:Eu  2+  and solid solutions Sr  2&#8722;  x  Ba  x  [BeAl  3  N  5  ]:Eu  2+  (  x  = 0.5, 1.0, 1.5) were synthesized in a hot isostatic press (HIP) under 50 MPa N  2  atmosphere at 1200 &#176;C. Ba  2  [BeAl  3  N  5  ]:Eu  2+  crystallizes in triclinic space group (no. 2) (  Z  = 2,  a  = 6.1869(10),  b  = 7.1736(13),  c  = 8.0391(14) &#197;,  &#945;  = 102.754(8),  &#946;  = 112.032(6),  &#947;  = 104.765(7)&#176;), which was determined from single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data. The lattice parameters of the solid solution series have been obtained from Rietveld refinements and show a nearly linear dependence on the atomic ratio Sr:Ba. The electronic properties and the band gaps of  M  2  [BeAl  3  N  5  ] (  M  = Sr, Ba) have been investigated by a combination of soft X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Upon irradiation with blue light (440&#8211;450 nm), the nitridoberylloaluminates exhibit intense orange to red luminescence, which can be tuned between 610 and 656 nm (fwhm = 1922&#8211; 2025 cm  &#8722;1  (72&#8211;87 nm)).

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The nitridoberylloaluminate Ba  2  [BeAl  3  N  5  ]:Eu  2+  and solid solutions Sr  2&#8722;  x  Ba  x  [BeAl  3  N  5  ]:Eu  2+  (  x  = 0.5, 1.0, 1.5) were synthesized in a hot isostatic press (HIP) under 50 MPa N  2  atmosphere at 1200 &#176;C. Ba  2  [BeAl  3  N  5  ]:Eu  2+  crystallizes in triclinic space group (no. 2) (  Z  = 2,  a  = 6.1869(10),  b  = 7.1736(13),  c  = 8.0391(14) &#197;,  &#945;  = 102.754(8),  &#946;  = 112.032(6),  &#947;  = 104.765(7)&#176;), which was determined from single-crystal X-ray diffraction data. The lattice parameters of the solid solution series have been obtained from Rietveld refinements and show a nearly linear dependence on the atomic ratio Sr:Ba. The electronic properties and the band gaps of  M  2  [BeAl  3  N  5  ] (  M  = Sr, Ba) have been investigated by a combination of soft X-ray spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Upon irradiation with blue light (440&#8211;450 nm), the nitridoberylloaluminates exhibit intense orange to red luminescence, which can be tuned between 610 and 656 nm (fwhm = 1922&#8211; 2025 cm  &#8722;1  (72&#8211;87 nm)). In contrast to the usual trend, the substitution of the smaller Sr  2+  by larger Ba  2+  leads to an inversetunable luminescence to higher wavelengths. Low-temperature luminescence measurements have been performed to exclude anomalous emission.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>A new fluorescent ribonucleoside alphabet (  mth  N) consisting of pyrimidines and purines analogues, all derived from methylthieno[3,4&#8208;  d  ]pyrimidine as the heterocyclic core, is described.&#160; Large bathochromic shifts and high microenvironmental susceptibility of their emission relative to previous alphabets derived from thieno[3,4&#8208;  d  ]pyrimidine (  th  N) and isothiazole[4,3&#8208;  d  ]pyrimidine (  tz  N) scaffolds are observed. Subjecting the purine analogues to adenosine deaminase, guanine deaminase and T7 RNA Polymerase indicate that, while varying, all but one enzyme tolerate the corresponding  mth  N/  mth  NTP substrates. The robust emission quantum yields, high photophysical responsiveness and enzymatic accommodation suggest that the  mth  N alphabet is a biophysically viable tool and can be used to probe the tolerance of nucleoside/tide&#8208;processing enzymes to structural perturbations of their substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Insight into Hydroboration of Imines from Combined Computational and Experimental Studies</title>

         <dc:description>Boron Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed and catalyst&#8208;free hydroboration reactions of imines are attractive due to the mild reaction conditions. In this work, the mechanistic details of the hydroboration reactions of two different kinds of imine with pinacolborane (HBpin) are investigated by combining density functional theory calculations and experimental studies. For the hydroboration reaction of  N  &#8208;(&#945;&#8208;methylbenzylidene)aniline catalyzed by tris[3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borane (BAr  F  3  ), our calculations show that the reaction proceeds through a boron Lewis acid&#8208;promoted hydride transfer mechanism rather than the classical Lewis acid&#8208;activation mechanism. For the catalyst&#8208; and solvent&#8208;free hydroboration reaction of imine,  N  &#8208;benzylideneaniline, our calculations and experimental studies indicate that this reaction is difficult to occur under the reaction conditions reported previously. With a combination of computational and experimental studies, we have established that the commercially available BH  3  &#183;SMe  2  can serve as an efficient catalyst for the hydroboration reaction of  N  &#8208;benzylideneaniline.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nonaqueous emulsions are crucial for a range of applications based on water&#8208;sensitive systems such as controlled polymerizations requiring anhydrous reaction conditions and the stabilization of readily hydrolyzable reagents or pharmacologically active components. However, defined molecular surfactants to stabilize such nonaqueous emulsions are scarce. We introduce a self&#8208;assembled coordination cage, decorated with cholesterol functionalities, to serve as a molecular surfactant for various oil&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsions of immiscible organic solvents. While the positively charged cage forms the amphiphile&#8217;s polar moiety, the non&#8208;polar cholesterol appendices can bend in a common direction to stabilize the emulsion. Templated by the droplets, polycondensation reactions were carried out to produce microstructured polyurethane and polyurea materials of different particle sizes and morphologies. Further, the amphiphilic cage can encapsulate a guest molecule and the resulting host&#8208;guest assembly was also examined as a surfactant. In addition, the aggregation behavior of the amphiphilic cage in an aqueous medium was examined.</dc:description>

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Domino Hydroformylation/Hydrogenation of Olefins to Alcohols: Synergy of Two Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Going to plan: Olefins have been hydroxymethylated by using an iridium catalyst and the synergy of two ligands. DFT calculations provided a chance to develop new catalytic systems before empirical studies were undertaken. Then the iridium&#8208;catalyzed domino hydroformylation/reduction of olefins to alcohols under water&#8211;gas shift reaction conditions was studied as an example. Two different ligands (L1 and L10) applied at the same time improved alcohol yields and verified the computational model.







Abstract
A novel one&#8208;pot iridium&#8208;catalyzed domino hydroxymethylation of olefins, which relies on using two different ligands at the same time, is reported. DFT computation reveals different activities for the individual hydroformylation and hydrogenation steps in the presence of mono&#8208; and bidentate ligands. Whereas bidentate ligands have higher hydrogenation activity, monodentate ligands show higher hydroformylation activity. Accordingly, a catalyst system is introduced that uses dual ligands in the whole domino process. Control experiments show that the overall selectivity is kinetically controlled. Both computation and experiment explain the function of the two optimized ligands during the domino process.

&lt;p&gt;A novel one-pot iridium-catalyzed domino hydroxymethylation of olefins, which relies on using two different ligands at the same time, is reported. DFT computation reveals different activities for the individual hydroformylation and hydrogenation steps in the presence of mono- and bidentate ligands. Whereas bidentate ligands have higher hydrogenation activity, monodentate ligands show higher hydroformylation activity. Accordingly, a catalyst system is introduced that uses dual ligands in the whole domino process. Control experiments show that the overall selectivity is kinetically controlled. Both computation and experiment explain the function of the two optimized ligands during the domino process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Competition for Hydride Between Silicon and Boron: Synthesis and Characterization of a Hydroborane&#8208;Stabilized Silylium Ion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Silylium against borenium&#8230;who wins when tugging on opposite &#8220;ends&#8221; of hydride? A cationic system based on a naphtalene&#8208;1,8&#8208;diyl platform has been designed for probing the competition for hydride between silicon and boron. The hydroborane&#8208;stabilized silylium ion with a delocalized three&#8208;center, two&#8208;electron B&#8722;H&#8722;Si bond and more silylium than borenium ion character is the winner (see Scheme; [B(C6F5)4]&#8722; omitted for clarity).







Abstract
Potent main&#8208;group Lewis acids are capable of activating element&#8208;hydrogen bonds. To probe the rivalry for hydride between silylium&#8208; and borenium&#8208;ion centers, a neutral precursor with the hydrosilane and hydroborane units in close proximity on a naphthalene&#8208;1,8&#8208;diyl platform was designed. Abstraction of one hydride leads to a hydroborane&#8208;stabilized silylium ion rather than a hydrosilane&#8208;coordinated borenium ion paired with [B(C6F5)4]&#8722; or [HCB11Cl11]&#8722; as counteranions. Characterization by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction supported by DFT calculations reveals a cationic, unsymmetrical open three&#8208;center, two&#8208;electron (3c2e) Si&#8722;H&#8722;B linkage.

Definite role&#8208;sharing and exact cooperation of the functional groups and hydrophobic cavity enable the regio&#8208;specific sulfonyl transfer reaction.







Abstract
Miniature models of acyl&#8208;transfer systems in cells, which were composed by replacing the protein, coenzyme, and substrate with CD, functional group, and CD, respectively, and combining them all together in one, displayed definite role&#8208;sharing and exact cooperation of the functional groups and hydrophobic cavity, and thus enabled the regio&#8208;specific reaction.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Mycinamicin IV as Integral Part of a Collective Approach to Macrolide Antibiotics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Final act: While a &#8220;collective&#8221; total synthesis of complex macrolide antibiotics illustrates the power of catalysis, it also shows that the glycosylation of elaborate targets remains far from routine. The success critically hinged on the development of robust new approaches to the peripheral (di)deoxy sugars and the proper choice amongst a set of only seemingly equivalent promoters.







Abstract
The total synthesis of the 16&#8208;membered macrolide mycinamicin IV is outlined, which complements our previously disclosed, largely catalysis&#8208;based route to the aglycone. This work must also be seen in the context of our recent conquest of aldgamycin N, a related antibiotic featuring a similar core but a distinctly different functionalization pattern. Taken together, these projects prove that the underlying blueprint is integrative and hence qualifies for a collective approach to this prominent class of natural products. In both cases, the final glycosylation phase mandated close attention and was accomplished only after robust de novo syntheses of the (di)deoxy sugars of the desosamine, chalcose, mycinose and aldgarose types had been established. Systematic screening of the glycosidation promoter was also critically important for success.

         <title>Reaching New Biocatalytic Reactivity Using Continuous Flow Reactors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Continuous flow is a mainstay in the synthetic chemist's toolbox. It has also begun to see increasing application in biocatalysis. This manuscript discusses some of the challenges that continuous flow has contributed solutions to for the improvement of biocatalysis. It also poses how the future of continuous flow biocatalysis will change with new technologies such as automation, in&#8208;line analysis and AI.







Abstract
The use of flow reactors in biocatalysis has increased significantly in recent years. Chemists have begun to design flow systems that even allow new biocatalytic reactions to take place. This concept article will focus on the design of flow systems that have allowed enzymes to go beyond their limits in batch. The case is made for moving towards fully continuous systems. With flow chemistry increasingly seen as an enabling technology for automated synthesis, and with advancements in AI&#8208;assisted enzyme design, there is a real possibility to fully automate the development and implementation of a continuous biocatalytic processes. This will lead to significantly improved enzyme processes for synthesis.

         <title>Evidence for Charge Delocalization in Diazafluorene Ligands Supporting Low&#8208;Valent [Cp*Rh] Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ligands based upon the 4,5&#8208;diazafluorene core are an important class of emerging ligands in organometallic chemistry, but the structure and electronic properties of these ligands have received less attention than they deserve. Here, we show that 9,9&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;diazafluorene (Me  2  daf) can stabilize low&#8208;valent complexes through charge delocalization into its conjugated &#960;&#8208;system. Using a new platform of [Cp*Rh] complexes with three accessible formal oxidation states (+III, +II, and +I), we show that the methylation in Me  2  daf is protective, blocking Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;base chemistry commonly encountered with other daf&#8208;based ligands. Electronic absorption spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of a family of eleven new compounds, including the unusual Cp*Rh(Me  2  daf), reveal features consistent with charge delocalization driven by &#960;&#8208;backbonding into the LUMO of Me  2  daf, reminiscent of behavior displayed by the workhorse 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl ligand. Taken together with spectrochemical data demonstrating clean conversion between oxidation states, our findings show that 9,9&#8242;&#8208;dialkylated daf&#8208;type ligands are promising building blocks for applications in reductive chemistry and catalysis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In this combined computational and experimental study, we performed studies on the C&#8208;H functionalization of 2&#8208;phenyl pyridine with diazoalkanes. Initial evaluation by computational methods allowed the evaluation of different metal catalysts and diazoalkanes and their compatibility in this C&#8208;H functionalization reaction. With these findings we were able to then quickly identify suitable reaction conditions for the C&#8208;H methylation reactions using highly reactive TMS diazomethane and C&#8208;H alkylation reactions with donor/acceptor diazoalkanes, which is applied to a broad scope on alkylation reactions of 2&#8208;aryl pyridines with TMS diazomethane and donor/acceptor diazoalkane (51 examples, up to 98% yield).</dc:description>

         <title>A Modular Synthesis of Substituted Cycloparaphenylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report a modular synthesis providing access to substituted cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) of different size. A key synthon introducing two geminal ester units was efficiently prepared via [2+2+2] cycloaddition reaction. This building block can be conveniently converted to macrocyclic precursors controlling the ring size of the final CPP. Efficient reductive aromatization  via  single&#8208;electron transfer provided the substituted nanohoops in a straight&#8208;forward manner. The  t&#8208;  Bu&#8208;ester substitution pattern enables a tube&#8208;like arrangement in the solid&#8208;state governed by van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals interactions exhibiting one of the tightest packings of CPPs in tube&#8208;direction known opening new avenues in crystal design of CPPs.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermodynamically favourable states in the reaction of nitrogenase without dissociation of any sulfide ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have used combined quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical (QM/MM) calculations to study the reaction mechanism of nitrogenase, assuming that none of the sulfide ligands dissociate. To avoid the problem that there is no consensus regarding the structure and protonation of the E&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;state, we start from a state where N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;is bound to the cluster and is protonated to N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, after dissociation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. We show that the reaction follows an alternating mechanism with HNNH (possibly protonated to HNNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;as intermediates and the two NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;products dissociate at the E&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;and E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;levels. For all intermediates, coordination to Fe6 is preferred, but for the E&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;and E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;intermediates, binding to Fe2 is competitive. For the E&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, E&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;and E&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;intermediates we find that the substrate may abstract a proton from the hydroxy group of the homocitrate ligand of the FeMo cluster, thereby forming HNNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;intermediates. This may explain why homocitrate is a mandatory component of nitrogenase. All steps in the suggested reaction mechanism are thermodynamically favourable compared to protonation of the nearby His&#8208;195 group and in all cases, protonation of the NE2 atom of the latter group is preferred</dc:description>

         <title>Origin of the different reactivity of the high&#8208;valent coinage&#8208;metal complexes [RCuiiiMe3]&#8722; and [RAgiiiMe3]&#8722; (R=allyl)**

Gas&#8208;phase fragmentation experiments reveal a contrasting reactivity of the high&#8208;valent coinage&#8208;metal complexes [RCuiiiMe3]&#8722; and [RAgiiiMe3]&#8722; (R=allyl). Using DFT, coupled&#8208;cluster and multi&#8208;configurational calculations together with kinetic modeling, the reactivity difference is traced back to different C&#8722;C coupling propensities of the two complexes. For [RAgMe3]&#8722;, an outer&#8208;sphere cross&#8208;coupling transition state featuring a large multi&#8208;configurational character plays a key role for the understanding of its reactivity.







Abstract
High&#8208;valent tetraalkylcuprates(iii) and &#8208;argentates(iii) are key intermediates of copper&#8208; and silver&#8208;mediated C&#8722;C coupling reactions. Here, we investigate the previously reported contrasting reactivity of [RMiiiMe3]&#8722; complexes (M=Cu, Ag and R=allyl) with energy&#8208;dependent collision&#8208;induced dissociation experiments, advanced quantum&#8208;chemical calculations and kinetic computations. The gas&#8208;phase fragmentation experiments confirmed the preferred formation of the [RCuMe]&#8722; anion upon collisional activation of the cuprate(iii) species, consistent with a homo&#8208;coupling reaction, whereas the silver analogue primarily yielded [AgMe2]&#8722;, consistent with a cross&#8208;coupling reaction. For both complexes, density functional theory calculations identified one mechanism for homo coupling and four different ones for cross coupling. Of these pathways, an unprecedented concerted outer&#8208;sphere cross coupling is of particular interest, because it can explain the formation of [AgMe2]&#8722; from the argentate(iii) species. Remarkably, the different C&#8722;C coupling propensities of the two [RMiiiMe3]&#8722; complexes become only apparent when properly accounting for the multi&#8208;configurational character of the wave function for the key transition state of [RAgMe3]&#8722;. Backed by the obtained detailed mechanistic insight for the gas&#8208;phase reactions, we propose that the previously observed cross&#8208;coupling reaction of the silver complex in solution proceeds via the outer&#8208;sphere mechanism.

         <title>Combined in silico and in vitro approaches to uncover the oxidation and Schiff base reaction of baicalein as an inhibitor of amyloid protein aggregation.</title>

         <dc:description>The oxidized form of&#160;baicalein&#160;(  BA  )&#160;leads to covalent binding with human amyloid proteins. Such adducts hamper&#160;the aggregation&#160;and deposition of fibrils. A novel reaction of&#160;  BA  &#160;with pentylamine (  PA  ) as a model for the lysine side chain is described. This is the first study addressing&#160;the&#160;atomistic details of a Schiff base reaction with the tri&#8208;hydroxylated moiety of&#160;  BA  .&#160;Nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry approaches&#160;clearly&#160;indicate the formation of dehydrobaicalein in solution as well as its condensation reaction with&#160;  PA  &#160;under aerobic conditions, yielding regioselective C6&#8208;substituted products. The combined results suggest initial ion pair formation between&#160;  BA  &#160;and&#160;  PA  , followed by a redox chain reaction: the initiation by oxygen/air; the&#160;  o  &#8208;quinone&#8208;based chain involving oxidation and reduction steps; and extra off&#8208;chain formation of a doubly oxidized product.&#160;These mechanistic details support the anti&#8208;amyloid activity of&#160;  BA  &#160;and endorse its trihydroxyphenyl&#8208;moiety as a pharmacophore for drug design studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Sandacrabins &#8211; Structurally unique antiviral RNA polymerase inhibitors from a rare myxobacterium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report structure elucidation and total synthesis of five unprecedented terpenoid&#8208;alkaloids, the sandacrabins, alongside with the first description of their producing organism  Sandaracinus  defensii  MSr10575, which expands the  Sandaracineae  family by only its second member. The genome sequence of  S. defensii  as presented in this study was utilized to identify enzymes responsible for sandacrabin formation, whereby dimethylbenzimidazol, deriving from cobalamin biosynthesis, was identified as key intermediate. Biological activity profiling revealed that all sandacrabins except congener A exhibit potent antiviral activity against the human pathogenic coronavirus HCoV229E in the three digit nanomolar range. Investigation of the underlying mode of action discloses that the sandacrabins inhibit the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA&#8208;dependent RNA polymerase complex, highlighting them as structurally distinct non&#8208;nucleoside RNA synthesis inhibitors. The observed segregation between cell toxicity at higher concentrations and viral inhibition opens the possibility for their medicinal chemistry optimization towards selective inhibitors.</dc:description>

         <title>Indoloquinoline Ligands Favor Intercalation at Quadruplex&#8208;Duplex Interfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quadruplex&#8208;duplex junctions: A quadruplex&#8208;duplex interface outcompetes an exposed 5&#8217;&#8208;outer tetrad of a parallel quadruplex as favored binding site for indoloquinoline ligands. The ligands intercalate between the G&#8208;tetrad and the neighboring Watson&#8208;Crick base pair located at the interface. High&#8208;affinity binding associated with a large exothermicity is driven by maximizing &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and electrostatic interactions of the positively charged indoloquinoline moiety.







Abstract
Quadruplex&#8208;duplex (Q&#8208;D) junctions are increasingly considered promising targets for medicinal and technological applications. Here, a Q&#8208;D hybrid with a hairpin&#8208;type snapback loop coaxially stacked onto the quadruplex 3&#8217;&#8208;outer tetrad was designed and employed as a target structure for the indoloquinoline ligand SYUIQ&#8208;5. NMR spectral analysis demonstrated high&#8208;affinity binding of the ligand at the quadruplex&#8208;duplex interface with association constants determined by isothermal titration calorimetry of about 107&#8197;M&#8722;1 and large exothermicities &#916;H&#176; of &#8722;14&#8197;kcal/mol in a 120&#8197;mM K+ buffer at 40&#8201;&#176;C. Determination of the ligand&#8208;bound hybrid structure revealed intercalation of SYUIQ&#8208;5 between 3&#8217;&#8208;outer tetrad and the neighboring CG base pair, maximizing &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking as well as electrostatic interactions with guanine carbonyl groups in close vicinity to the positively charged protonated quinoline nitrogen of the tetracyclic indoloquinoline. Exhibiting considerable flexibility, the SYUIQ&#8208;5 sidechain resides in the duplex minor groove. Based on comparative binding studies with the non&#8208;substituted N5&#8208;methylated indoloquinoline cryptolepine, the sidechain is suggested to confer additional affinity and to fix the alignment of the intercalated indoloquinoline aromatic core. However, selectivity for the Q&#8208;D junction mostly relies on the geometry and charge distribution of the indoloquinoline ring system. The presented results are expected to provide valuable guidelines for the design of ligands specifically targeting Q&#8208;D interfaces.

         <title>Biodegradation of Herbicides by a Plant Nonheme Iron Dioxygenase: Mechanism and Selectivity of Substrate Analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Density functional theory calculations show how plant enzymes can initiate the biodegradation of herbicide molecules efficiently. However, the reactivity of substituted substrate analogues is slowed down and in some cases encounters a large rebound barrier.







Abstract
Aryloxyalkanoate dioxygenases are unique herbicide biodegrading nonheme iron enzymes found in plants and hence, from environmental and agricultural point of view they are important and valuable. However, they often are substrate specific and little is known on the details of the mechanism and the substrate scope. To this end, we created enzyme models and calculate the mechanism for 2,4&#8208;dichlorophenoxyacetic acid biodegradation and 2&#8208;methyl substituted analogues by density functional theory. The work shows that the substrate binding is tight and positions the aliphatic group close to the metal center to enable a chemoselective reaction mechanism to form the C2&#8208;hydroxy products, whereas the aromatic hydroxylation barriers are well higher in energy. Subsequently, we investigated the metabolism of R&#8208; and S&#8208;methyl substituted inhibitors and show that these do not react as efficiently as 2,4&#8208;dichlorophenoxyacetic acid substrate due to stereochemical clashes in the active site and particularly for the R&#8208;isomer give high rebound barriers.

         <title>Sterically Crowded Tris(2&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)phenyl)phosphine &#8211; Is it Still a Ligand?</title>

P(o&#8208;TMSC6H4)3: A phosphine with selective reactivity. The steric bulk (represented by the security guard) shields the phosphorus from most external influences &#8211; but not from all. Spectroscopy and diffraction reveal the structural diversity of this molecule and its hand picked reaction products.







Abstract
Tris(2&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)phenyl)phosphine, P(o&#8208;TMSC6H4)3, was synthesised and characterised in solution and in the solid state. The large steric bulk prevents most reactions of the phosphorus donor and makes the compound air stable both in the solid state as well as in solution. This shielded phosphine can still undergo three reactions, namely protonation, oxidation to the phosphine oxide under harsh conditions and complexation to AuI, thus forming a complex with linear coordination. Unexpectedly, complexation was unsuccessful with a range of other metal cations. Neither PdII, PtII, ZnII nor HgII reacted and even the remaining coinage metal cations CuI and AgI could not be coordinated. Both the parent molecule as well as the reaction products were structurally characterised by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, and the conformational change of geometry required to accommodate the additional atoms was analysed in detail. Apart from chemical oxidation with H2O2, P(o&#8208;TMSC6H4)3 displays reversible electrochemical oxidation with a potential not unlike the one of sterically unencumbered phosphines for which the oxidation is usually not reversible. P(o&#8208;TMSC6H4)3 can thus be considered a model compound for the investigation of the electronic properties of sterically unencumbered phosphines.

         <title>Modulation of the Conformational Space of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA Quadruplex RG&#8208;1&#8201;by Cellular Components and the Amyloidogenic Peptides &#945;&#8208;Synuclein and hIAPP</title>

Pre&#8208;existing conditions play a critical role in disease progression after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. In this study, we sought to unravel the underlying mechanisms related to the interactions between peptides relevant to type II diabetes mellitus and Parkinson's disease and the G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;forming sequence RG&#8208;1 of the viral RNA.







Abstract
Given the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome&#8208;coronavirus&#8208;2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2), which particularly threatens older people with comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus and dementia, understanding the relationship between Covid&#8208;19 and other diseases is an important factor for treatment. Possible targets for medical intervention include G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4Qs) and their protein interaction partners. We investigated the stability and conformational space of the RG&#8208;1 RNA&#8208;G&#8208;quadruplex of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 N&#8208;gene in the presence of salts, cosolutes, crowders and intrinsically disordered peptides, focusing on &#945;&#8208;Synuclein and the human islet amyloid polypeptide, which are involved in Parkinson's disease (PD) and type&#8208;II diabetes mellitus (T2DM), respectively. We found that the conformational dynamics of the RG&#8208;1 G4Q is strongly affected by the various solution conditions.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pre-existing conditions&lt;/b&gt; play a critical role in disease progression after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. In this study, we sought to unravel the underlying mechanisms related to the interactions between peptides relevant to type II diabetes mellitus and Parkinson's disease and the G-quadruplex-forming sequence RG-1 of the viral RNA.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which particularly threatens older people with comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus and dementia, understanding the relationship between Covid-19 and other diseases is an important factor for treatment. Possible targets for medical intervention include G-quadruplexes (G4Qs) and their protein interaction partners. We investigated the stability and conformational space of the RG-1 RNA-G-quadruplex of the SARS-CoV-2 N-gene in the presence of salts, cosolutes, crowders and intrinsically disordered peptides, focusing on &#945;-Synuclein and the human islet amyloid polypeptide, which are involved in Parkinson's disease (PD) and type-II diabetes mellitus (T2DM), respectively. We found that the conformational dynamics of the RG-1 G4Q is strongly affected by the various solution conditions. Further, the amyloidogenic peptides were found to strongly modulate the conformational equilibrium of the RG-1. Considerable changes are observed with respect to their interaction with human telomeric G4Qs, which adopt different topologies. These results may therefore shed more light on the relationship between PD as well as T2DM and the SARS-CoV-2 disease and their molecular underpinnings. Since dysregulation of G4Q formation by rationally designed targeting compounds affects the control of cellular processes, this study should contribute to the development of specific ligands for intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ring Opening Reactions of &#946;&#8208;Propiolactam in Superacidic Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Opening up possibilities: The reaction of &#946;&#8208;propiolactam in the superacidic systems HF/MF5 and SO2/HF/MF5 (M=Sb, As) leads exclusively to previously unknown open&#8208;chain compounds. With HF as the solvent, salts of monoprotonated 3&#8208;aminopropanoyl fluoride and diprotonated &#946;&#8208;alanine are obtained, depending on the reaction conditions. Interestingly, the change of the solvent to SO2 leads to the formation of a salt containing a thionylimide moiety.







Abstract
The reaction of &#946;&#8208;propiolactam in the superacidic systems HF/MF5 (M=Sb, As) led to the formation of monoprotonated 3&#8208;aminopropanoyl fluoride in the form of [C(O)F(CH2)2NH3][SbF6] and [C(O)F(CH2)2NH3][AsF6]. In the presence of traces of water, the diprotonated species &#946;&#8208;alanine [C(OH)2(CH2)2NH3][AsF6]2 was synthesized for the first time. All salts were characterized by low&#8208;temperature infrared and Raman spectroscopy. Additionally, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analyses were conducted in the case of [C(O)F(CH2)2NH3][SbF6] and [C(OH)2(CH2)2NH3][AsF6]2. By using SO2 instead of HF as the solvent, the salt [C(OH)2(CH2)2NHSO][SbF6]2 was obtained, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis of this salt containing a thionylimide moiety was conducted. For the formation of these open&#8208;chain compounds, an acyl cationic species as intermediate is assumed, which is formed from N&#8208;protonated &#946;&#8208;propiolactam. Quantum chemical calculations at the B3LYP/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ and MP2/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ levels of theory were carried out to gain a better understanding of the formation and the structural properties of protonated &#946;&#8208;propiolactam.

         <title>Coordination&#8208;Induced Band Gap Reduction in a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coordination&#8208;induced band gap reduction. Experimental Tauc plots indicate that TUB1 possesses indirect and direct band gaps of 2.4&#8197;eV and 2.7&#8197;eV, respectively. DFT calculations reveal two spin&#8208;dependent gaps of 2.60&#8197;eV and 0.48&#8197;eV for the alpha and beta spins, respectively, with the lowest unoccupied crystal orbital for both gaps predominantly residing on the square planar copper atoms. This results in a lower overall band gap, as the beta&#8208;gap for the trigonal bipyramidal copper atoms is 3.72&#8197;eV.







Abstract
Herein, we report on the synthesis of a microporous, three&#8208;dimensional phosphonate metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) with the composition Cu3(H5&#8208;MTPPA)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2 NMP (H8&#8208;MTPPA=methane tetra&#8208;p&#8208;phenylphosphonic acid and NMP=N&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyrrolidone). This MOF, termed TUB1, has a unique one&#8208;dimensional inorganic building unit composed of square planar and distorted trigonal bipyramidal copper atoms. It possesses a (calculated) BET surface area of 766.2&#8197;m2/g after removal of the solvents from the voids. The Tauc plot for TUB1 yields indirect and direct band gaps of 2.4&#8197;eV and 2.7&#8197;eV, respectively. DFT calculations reveal the existence of two spin&#8208;dependent gaps of 2.60&#8197;eV and 0.48&#8197;eV for the alpha and beta spins, respectively, with the lowest unoccupied crystal orbital for both gaps predominantly residing on the square planar copper atoms. The projected density of states suggests that the presence of the square planar copper atoms reduces the overall band gap of TUB1, as the beta&#8208;gap for the trigonal bipyramidal copper atoms is 3.72&#8197;eV.

         <title>Bimodal Fluorescence/Magnetic Resonance Molecular Probes with Extended Spin Lifetimes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;lived nuclear singlet states have been shown to be a viable tool in many different areas of research, from material sciences over the investigation of catalytic cycles to applications in biochemistry. The synthesis of four compounds, in which a nuclear singlet state in pairs of 13C and 15N nuclei can be populated is shown. Furthermore, bimodal fluorescence/singlet&#8208;state NMR application for the determination of water concentration has been investigated, which can be useful in a variety of fields.







Abstract
Bimodal molecular probes combining nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and fluorescence have been widely studied in basic science, as well as clinical research. The investigation of spin phenomena holds promise to broaden the scope of available probes allowing deeper insights into physiological processes. Herein, a class of molecules with a bimodal character with respect to fluorescence and nuclear spin singlet states is introduced. Singlet states are NMR silent but can be probed indirectly. Symmetric, perdeuterated molecules, in which the singlet states can be populated by vanishingly small electron&#8208;mediated couplings (below 1&#8197;Hz) are reported. The lifetimes of these states are an order of magnitude longer than the longitudinal relaxation times and up to four&#8197;minutes at 7 T. Moreover, these molecules show either aggregation induced emission (AIE) or aggregation caused quenching (ACQ) with respect to their fluorescence. In the latter case, the existence of excited dimers, which are proposed to use in a switchable manner in combination with the quenching of nuclear spin singlet states, is observed

         <title>Injectable Micromotor@Hydrogel System for Antibacterial Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An injectable micromotor@hydrogel drug delivery system which can be injected directly into lesions to release micromotors in response to the environment has been developed to reduce external influence on micromotors and improve the sustained&#8208;release effect. Micromotors underwent enhanced diffusion in the surroundings of bacteria without addition of exogenous hydrogen peroxide, which was manifested by their appearance in edge of the inhibition zone. The proposed micromotor@hydrogel drug delivery system offers a new strategy for the treatment of bacterial infections.







Abstract
The drug delivery system based on nano/micromotors has become a research hot spot in recent years. However, naked micromotors may be ruptured or passivated under the complex biological environment, which will result in the leakage of drugs in advance or limited self&#8208;propulsion performance. Herein, an injectable micromotor@hydrogel drug delivery system to protect micromotors from the external environment is proposed. The micromotors were prepared through layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly technology.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An injectable&lt;/b&gt; micromotor@hydrogel drug delivery system which can be injected directly into lesions to release micromotors in response to the environment has been developed to reduce external influence on micromotors and improve the sustained-release effect. Micromotors underwent enhanced diffusion in the surroundings of bacteria without addition of exogenous hydrogen peroxide, which was manifested by their appearance in edge of the inhibition zone.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drug delivery system based on nano/micromotors has become a research hot spot in recent years. However, naked micromotors may be ruptured or passivated under the complex biological environment, which will result in the leakage of drugs in advance or limited self-propulsion performance. Herein, an injectable micromotor@hydrogel drug delivery system to protect micromotors from the external environment is proposed. The micromotors were prepared through layer-by-layer assembly technology. The asymmetric decomposition of hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by the locally distributed platinum nanoparticles enabled efficient propulsion of the micromotors in low concentration of hydrogen peroxide. In order to protect micromotors, they were loaded into the Schiff base hydrogel. The micromotor@hydrogel system can be injected directly into the lesion to release micromotors in response to the environment, reducing external influence on micromotors and improving the sustained-release effect. Erythromycin (Ery) loaded into the micromotors and the micromotor@hydrogel system demonstrated excellent antibacterial effect. Micromotors released from the hydrogel underwent enhanced diffusion in the surroundings of bacteria without addition of exogenous hydrogen peroxide, which was manifested by their appearance in edge of the inhibition zone. The proposed micromotor@hydrogel drug delivery system offers a new strategy for the treatment of bacterial infections.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Surface Rh species with three iodine atoms showed a high catalytic activity for the hydrosilylation of terminal olefins. The picture indicates three iodides with an ammonium cation &#8220;tent&#8221; coordinate to Rh, and the hydrosilylation reaction occurs at the electron&#8208;rich Rh site. Next, the intermediate reacts with CO2 coming from the factory with the assistance of an iodide, then the final product silyl carbonate is formed.

         <title>Olefin Metathesis in Confinement: Towards Covalent Organic Framework Scaffolds for Increased Macrocyclization Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic confinement and precise spatial arrangement of catalysts in porous media can provide increased selectivity for reactions compared to homogeneous catalysis. Herein, a covalent organic framework for molecular heterogeneous olefin metathesis is presented that utilizes spatial confinement of substrates in its pores for a substrate&#8208;size dependent and increased macro(mono)cyclization selectivity.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer vast structural and chemical diversity enabling a wide and growing range of applications. While COFs are well&#8208;established as heterogeneous catalysts, so far, their high and ordered porosity has scarcely been utilized to its full potential when it comes to spatially confined reactions in COF pores to alter the outcome of reactions. Here, we present a highly porous and crystalline, large&#8208;pore COF as catalytic support in &#945;,&#969;&#8208;diene ring&#8208;closing metathesis reactions, leading to increased macrocyclization selectivity. COF pore&#8208;wall modification by immobilization of a Grubbs&#8208;Hoveyda&#8208;type catalyst via a mild silylation reaction provides a molecularly precise heterogeneous olefin metathesis catalyst. An increased macro(mono)cyclization (MMC) selectivity over oligomerization (O) for the heterogeneous COF&#8208;catalyst (MMC:O=1.35) of up to 51&#8201;% compared to the homogeneous catalyst (MMC:O=0.90) was observed along with a substrate&#8208;size dependency in selectivity, pointing to diffusion limitations induced by the pore confinement.

         <title>Lights and Shadows of DMSO as Solvent for Tin Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dead&#8208;end for DMSO? The crystallization of tin halide perovskites into thin&#8208;films is uncontrolled. The strongly&#8208;binding solvent DMSO and its tolerance to additives helped here. However, device performance stagnates around 10&#8211;15&#8201;%. The oxidation of tin by DMSO could explain this. Efforts to substitute it are promising, but still lag behind. Addressing solution properties from a fundamental perspective will allow developing DMSO&#8208;free systems.







Abstract
In 2020 dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), the ever&#8208;present solvent for tin halide perovskites, was identified as an oxidant for SnII. Nonetheless, alternatives are lacking and few efforts have been devoted to replacing it. To understand this trend it is indispensable to learn the importance of DMSO on the development of tin halide perovskites. Its unique properties have allowed processing compact thin&#8208;films to be integrated into tin perovskite solar cells. Creative approaches for controlling the perovskite crystallization or increasing its stability to oxidation have been developed relying on DMSO&#8208;based inks. However, increasingly sophisticated strategies appear to lead the field to a plateau of power conversion efficiency in the range of 10&#8211;15&#8201;%. And, while DMSO&#8208;based formulations have performed in encouraging means so far, we should also start considering their potential limitations. In this concept article, we discuss the benefits and limitations of DMSO&#8208;based tin perovskite processing.

         <title>Ylide&#8208;Stabilized Phosphenium Cations: Impact of the Substitution Pattern on the Coordination Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switching selectivity: The isolation and coordination chemistry of a series of ylide&#8208;substituted phosphenium cations is reported. The monoylidyl cations exhibit a distinctly higher reactivity and electrophilicity, thus yielding a chlorophosphine gold cation via chloride shift from gold to phosphorus. In contrast, the diylidyl cation formed the phosphenium AuCl complex, demonstrating the tunability of the phosphenium cation reactivity.







Abstract
Although N&#8208;heterocyclic phosphenium (NHP) cations have received considerable research interest due to their application in organocatalysis, including asymmetric synthesis, phosphenium cations with other substitution patterns have hardly been explored. Herein, the preparation of a series of ylide&#8208;substituted cations of type [YPR]+ (with Y=Ph3PC(Ph), R=Ph, Cy or Y) and their structural and coordination properties are reported. Although the diylide&#8208;substituted cation forms spontaneous from the chlorophosphine precursor, the monoylidylphosphenium ions required the addition of a halide&#8208;abstraction reagent. The molecular structures of the cations reflected the different degrees of electron donation from the ylide to the phosphorus center depending on the second substituent. Molecular orbital analysis confirmed the stronger donor properties of the ylide systems compared to NHPs with the mono&#8208;ylide substituted cations featuring a more pronounced electrophilicity. This was mirrored by the reaction of the cations towards gold chloride, in which only the diylide&#8208;substituted cation [Y2P]+ formed the expected LAuCl]+ complex, while the monoylide&#8208;substituted compounds reacted to the chlorophosphine ligands by transfer of the chloride from gold to the phosphorus center. These results demonstrate the tunability of ylide&#8208;functionalized phosphorus cations, which should allow for further applications in coordination chemistry in the future.

         <title>Alkaline Stability of Low Oxophilicity Metallopolymer Anion&#8208;Exchange Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metallopolymers can address many of the challenges of anion&#8208;exchange membranes in electrochemical devices, especially those requiring high alkaline stability. Using the same polymer backbone and NHC ligand, membranes are prepared using low oxophilicity metals such as Cu, Zn, Ni and Au, and their relative alkaline stabilities are compared. The Au(III) metallopolymer demonstrates unparalleled alkaline stability and good ion&#8208;conductivity.







Abstract
Anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) are promising energy conversion devices due to their high efficiency. Nonetheless, AEMFC operation time is currently limited by the low chemical stability of their polymeric anion&#8208;exchange membranes. In recent years, metallopolymers, where the metal centers assume the ion transport function, have been proposed as a chemically stable alternative. Here we present a systematic study using a polymer backbone with side&#8208;chain N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands complexed to various metals with low oxophilicity, such as copper, zinc, nickel, and gold. The golden metallopolymer, using the metal with the lowest oxophilicity, demonstrates exceptional alkaline stability, far superior to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quaternary ammonium cations, as well as good in situ AEMFC results. These results demonstrate that judiciously designed metallopolymers may be superior to purely organic membranes and provides a scientific base for further developments in the field.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Metallopolymers&lt;/b&gt; can address many of the challenges of anion-exchange membranes in electrochemical devices, especially those requiring high alkaline stability. Using the same polymer backbone and NHC ligand, membranes are prepared using low oxophilicity metals such as Cu, Zn, Ni and Au, and their relative alkaline stabilities are compared. The Au(III) metallopolymer demonstrates unparalleled alkaline stability and good ion-conductivity.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anion-exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) are promising energy conversion devices due to their high efficiency. Nonetheless, AEMFC operation time is currently limited by the low chemical stability of their polymeric anion-exchange membranes. In recent years, metallopolymers, where the metal centers assume the ion transport function, have been proposed as a chemically stable alternative. Here we present a systematic study using a polymer backbone with side-chain N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands complexed to various metals with low oxophilicity, such as copper, zinc, nickel, and gold. The golden metallopolymer, using the metal with the lowest oxophilicity, demonstrates exceptional alkaline stability, far superior to state-of-the-art quaternary ammonium cations, as well as good in situ AEMFC results. These results demonstrate that judiciously designed metallopolymers may be superior to purely organic membranes and provides a scientific base for further developments in the field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Properties of the reactants and their interactions within and with the enzyme binding
cavity determine reaction selectivities. The case of Fe(II)/2&#8208;oxoglutarate dependent enzymes.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fe(II)/2&#8208;oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenases (ODDs) share a double stranded beta helix (DSBH) fold and utilise a common reactive intermediate, ferryl species, to catalyse oxidative transformations of substrates. Despite the structural similarities, ODDs accept a variety of substrates and facilitate a wide range of reactions, i.e. hydroxylations, desaturations, (oxa)cyclisations and ring rearrangements. In this review we present and discuss the factors contributing to the observed (regio)selectivities of ODDs. They span from inherent properties of the reactants, i.e. substrate molecule and iron cofactor, to the interactions between the substrate and the enzyme&#8217;s binding cavity; the latter can counterbalance the effect of the former. Based on results of both experimental and computational studies dedicated to ODDs, we also line out the properties of the reactants which promote reaction outcomes other than the &#8220;default&#8221; hydroxylation. It turns out that the reaction selectivity depends on a delicate balance of interactions between the components of the investigated system.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of the Flexibility of Nickel PCP&#8208;Pincer Complexes on C&#8211;H and P&#8211;C Bond Activation and Ethylene Reactivity: A Combined Experimental and Theoretical Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using a pincer platform based on a bridgehead NHC donor with functional side arms, we examined the combined effect of increased flexibility in six&#8208;membered pyrimidine&#8208;type heterocycles compared to the more often studied five&#8208;membered imidazole, and rigidity of phosphane side arms. The unique features observed include (i) the reaction of the azolium Csp2&#8211;H bond with [Ni(cod)2] affording a carbanionic ligand in [NiCl(PCsp3HP)] (8) rather than a carbene, (ii) its transformation into the NHC, hydrido complex [NiH(PCNHCP)]PF6&#160;(9) upon halide abstraction, (iii) ethylene insertion into the Ni&#8211;H bond of the latter and ethyl migration to the N&#8211;C&#8211;N carbon atom of the heterocycle in [Ni(PCEtP)]PF6&#160;(10) and (iv) an unprecedented C&#8211;P bond activation transforming the P&#8211;CNHC&#8211;P pincer ligand of&#160;8&#160;in a C&#8211;CNHC&#8211;P pincer and a terminal phosphanido ligand in [Ni(PPh2)(CCNHCP)] (15).

         <title>Synthesis of Polyoxygenated Tropolones and their Antiviral Activity Against Hepatitis B Virus and Herpes Simplex Virus&#8208;1</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyoxygenated tropolones possess a broad range of biological activity, and as a result are promising lead structures or fragments for drug&#8208;development. However, structure&#8208;function studies and subsequent optimization have been challenging, in part due to the limited number of readily available tropolones and the obstacles to their synthesis.&#160; The oxidopyrylium [5+2] cycloaddition reaction can effectively generate a diverse array of 7&#8208;membered ring carbocycles, and as a result can provide a highly general strategy for tropolone synthesis.&#160; Here, we describe the use of 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;4&#8208;pyrone&#8208;based oxidopyrylium cycloaddition chemistry in synthesis of functionalized 3,7&#8208;dimethoxytropolones, 3,7&#8208;dihydroxytropolones, and isomeric 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;7&#8208;methoxytropolones through complementary benzyl alcohol&#8208;incorporating procedures. Antiviral activity of these molecules against herpes simplex virus&#8208;1 and hepatitis B virus is also described, highlighting the value of this approach and providing new structure&#8208;function insight relevant to their antiviral activity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The use of arylboron reagents in metal&#8208;catalyzed domino addition&#8722;cyclization reactions is a well&#8208;established strategy for the preparation of diverse, highly functionalized carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic products.

In contrast, in the presence of base and under activation of AgOTf, switching of 5&#8208;  exo  into 6&#8208;  endo  cyclizations of 2&#8208;(1&#8208;alkynyl)benzaldimines was observed, exclusively giving  N  &#8208;aryl or  N  &#8208;alkyl substituted isoquinolinium salts.

         <title>Formation of supramolecular nanostructures via in situ self&#8208;assembly and post&#8208;assembly modification of a biocatalytically constructed dipeptide hydrazide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous self&#8208;assembly of short peptides has attracted growing attention for the construction of supramolecular materials for various bioapplications. Herein, we describe that the thermolysin&#8208;assisted biocatalytic construction of a dipeptide hydrazide from an  N  &#8208;protected amino acid and an amino acid hydrazide leads to the formation of thermally stable supramolecular hydrogels. In addition, we demonstrate the post&#8208;assembly modification of the  in situ  constructed supramolecular architectures tethering hydrazide groups as a chemical handle by means of fluorescence imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Abnormal Association between Metal&#8208;organic cages and counterions regulated by the Hydration Shells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We observed a unique trend in the binding affinity between cationic metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) and external counter&#8208;anions in aqueous media. Behaving like many macroions, two MOCs, sharing similar structures but carrying different number of charges, self&#8208;assembled into hollow spherical single&#8208;layered blackberry&#8208;type structures via counterion&#8208;mediated attraction. Dynamic and static light scattering, and isothermal titration calorimetry measurements confirm the stronger interactions among less charged MOCs and counter&#8208;anions than that of highly charged MOCs, leading to larger assembly sizes. DOSY NMR measurements suggest the significance of thick hydration shells of highly charged MOCs, inhibiting the MOC&#8208;counterion binding and weakening the interaction between them. This study demonstrates that the greater role played by hydration shell on ion&#8208;pair formation comparing with charge density of MOCs.</dc:description>

         <title>An Adaptive Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework for the Exclusive Recognition of p&#8208;Xylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Separation of xylene isomers is one of the most important but most challenging and energy&#8208;intensive separation processes in the petrochemical industry. Here, we report an adaptive hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF&#8208;28) constructed from a porphyrin based organic building block 4,4',4'',4'''&#8208;(porphyrin&#8208;5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrayl) tetrabenzonitrile (PTTBN), exhibiting the exclusive molecular recognition of p&#8208;xylene (pX) over its isomers of o&#8208;xylene (oX) and m&#8208;xylene (mX), as clearly demonstrated in the single crystal structure transformation and 1H NMR studies. Single crystal structure studies show that single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation from the as&#8208;synthesized HOF&#8208;28 to the pX exclusively included HOF&#8208;28&#201;pX is triggered by the encapsulation of pX molecules, accompanied by sliding of the 2D layers and local distortion of the ligand, which provides multiple C&#8722;H&#183;&#183; &#960; interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable excimer circularly polarized luminescence in isohexide derivatives from renewable resources</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic compounds showing circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) are at the forefront of novel applications and technologies. Here we show the synthesis and chiroptical properties of pyrene and perylene derivatives of inexpensive chiral scaffolds: isomannide and isosorbide. Low&#8208;intensity ECD spectra were obtained, suggesting the absence of chromophore interaction in the ground state, except in the case of isomannide bis&#8208;perylenecarboxylate, whose ECD spectrum showed a positive exciton couplet. All isomannide derivatives, with the only exception of the one containing a pyrenecarboxylate and a perylenecarboxylate, exhibited excimer CPL spectra, whereas isosorbide derivatives did not show any CPL. Isomannide derivatives bearing two pyrenecarboxylate or two pyrenylacetate groups showed positive CPL emission with dissymmetry factors up to 10  &#8208;2  , which depends on the conformational freedom of the appended units. The CPL sign, Stokes shift and order of magnitude of dissymmetry factor were reproduced by excited&#8208;state calculations on a representative compound. Interestingly, the mixed derivative containing pyrenic units with different spacing from the isomannide scaffold showed an oppositely signed excimer band with respect to the homo&#8208;substituted derivatives.</dc:description>

Anthracene congestion: 1,2,3&#8208;Tri(9&#8208;anthryl)benzene derivatives containing radially shaped &#960;&#8208;clusters were constructed by using PdI&#8208;catalyzed Negishi coupling reactions. The presence of &#960;&#8208;congestion as well as intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; and CH&#8211;&#960; interactions between anthracene units in the crystalline state gives these substances unique electronic properties. The excited&#8208;state dynamics associated with the radially arranged &#960;&#8208;system were elucidated by using transient absorption measurements.







Abstract
We report the Negishi coupling based synthesis of 1,2,3&#8208;tri(9&#8208;anthryl)benzene derivatives containing three radially arranged anthracenes in a &#960;&#8208;cluster. In the crystalline state of the unsubstituted derivative, intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; and CH&#8211;&#960; interactions between the anthracene units drive the formation of the two&#8208;dimensional packing structure. Owing to though&#8208;space &#960;&#8208;conjugation between anthracene units, the substances have unique electronic properties. The excited&#8208;state dynamic behavior occurring between the three anthracene moieties, such as exciton localization/delocalization, was elucidated by means of transient absorption measurements and quantum chemical calculations. Interestingly, even though the three anthracenes are closely oriented with approximately 3.0&#8197;&#197; between their C&#8208;9 positions, exciton localization on two anthracene units is energetically favorable because of the flexible nature of the radially arranged aromatic rings.

A new P&#8208;stereogenic linear tetraphosphine tetraoxide, (R,R)/(S,S)&#8208;Ph2P(=O)CH2P(=O)(Ph)CH2P(=O)(Ph)CH2P(=O)Ph2 abbreviated as (R,R)/(S,S)&#8208;dpmppm(=O)4 (L4RR/SS), was synthesized to prepare C2 dinuclear M(hfa)3 complexes, [M2((R,R)/(S,S)&#8208;dpmppm(=O)4)(hfa)6] (M=Y, Eu, Tb: M2L4RR/SS), which revealed significant chiral induction from the P&#8208;chiral centers on the achiral M(hfa)3 units through intramolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking constraint in the dinuclear system on the basis of circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) measurements.







Abstract
A P&#8208;stereogenic linear tetraphosphine tetraoxide, (R,R)&#8208; or (S,S)&#8208;dpmppm(=O)4, was synthesized to prepare C2 dinuclear M(hfa)3 complexes (M=Eu, Tb, Y) as the first example of lanthanide(III) complexes with P&#8208;chiral multidentate phosphine oxides. The mononuclear M(hfa)3 complexes (M=Eu, Y) with a P&#8208;chiral diphosphine dioxide, tpdpb(=O)2, were also prepared, and comparison of their photophysical properties for the EuIII complexes revealed that significant chiral induction from the P&#8208;chiral centers arises on the achiral M(hfa)3 units through intramolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking constraint in the dinuclear system.

         <title>Introducing the Chiral Constrained &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethylalanine in Aib Foldamers to Control, Quantify and Assign the Helical Screw&#8208;Sense**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chiral &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethylalanine is shown to induce and control the screw&#8208;sense preference of short Aib oligomers. Due to the electronic properties of the CF3 group, the screw&#8208;sense is inversed compared to that induced by its non&#8208;fluorinated isosteric l&#8208;&#945;&#8208;MeVal analogue. It also plays the role of 19F NMR reporter allowing the easy determination of both the magnitude of the screw&#8208;sense preference and the assignment of its sign.







Abstract
Oligomers of &#945;&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) are achiral peptides that adopt 310 helical structures with equal population of left&#8208; and right&#8208;handed conformers. The screw&#8208;sense preference of the helical chain may be controlled by a single chiral residue located at one terminus. 1H and 19F NMR, X&#8208;ray crystallography and circular dichroism studies on new Aib oligomers show that the incorporation of a chiral quaternary &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethylalanine at their N&#8208;terminus induces a reversal of the screw&#8208;sense preference of the 310&#8208;helix compared to that of a non&#8208;fluorinated analogue having an l&#8208;&#945;&#8208;methyl valine residue. This work demonstrates that, among the many particular properties of introducing a trifluoromethyl group into foldamers, its stereo&#8208;electronic properties are of major interest to control the helical screw sense. Its use as an easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle 19F NMR probe to reliably determine both the magnitude of the screw&#8208;sense preference and its sign assignment is also of remarkable interest.

         <title>d&#8208;Orbital Reconstructions Forced by Double Bow&#8208;Shaped Deformations and Second Coordination Sphere Effects of Cu(II) Heme Analogs in HER**
</title>

         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance of copper heme analogs has been modulated by geometric deformation. The work not only provides a new perspective on the function of natural heme distortion but also contributes a practical strategy to improve the catalytic performance of hemes through ligand geometric modulation.







Abstract
Both geometric architecture and electronic configurations of heme proteins contribute to its activity. In this work we designed and synthesized a series of four copper(II) porphyrin complexes (4&#8208;, 3&#8208;, 2&#8208; and 1&#8208;Cu) where the molecular conformations are modulated by a pair of stepwise shortened straps on the same porphyrin side (cis&#8208;ortho) to give double bow&#8208;shaped skeletons. Single crystal structures demonstrate that the straps gradually increase the saddle deformation and the deviation of the metal centers, which is in accordance with two, unusual d&#8208;orbital reconstructions of two different ground states, as revealed by 4&#8197;K EPR and DFT calculations. In the study of the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), 1&#8208;Cu, with the shortest straps, showed the most apparent improvement of activity. Second coordination sphere (SCS) effects created by the double bow&#8208;shaped architecture and the strong saddle porphyrin core in 1&#8208;Cu are found to play key roles in proton trapping during the catalytic process. The work contributes a novel strategy to improve the catalytic performance of heme analogs through ligand geometric modulation.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Bonding&#8208;Enhanced Self&#8208;Co&#8208;Reactant Electrogenerated Chemiluminescence for Sensitive and Selective Detection of Thioglycolic Acid in Cosmetics</title>

Au&#8722;S bonding&#8208;amplified, highly sensitive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) sensing method for Thioglycolic acid (TGA) detection using tris(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) (Ru(bpy)32+) as a luminophore and TGA as a self&#8208;co&#8208;reactant, via an anodic reaction at the Au electrode surface was reported.







Abstract
Thioglycolic acid (TGA) is an organic compound widely used in cosmetics that cause a variety of health problems when overexposed to it. So far many attempts have been made to develop methods for TGA detection, but most of them need sophisticated instrumentations and are a little bit complicated. Therefore, a simple, cheap and sensitive detection method of TGA is highly desired. Herein, we demonstrated for the first time an Au&#8722;S bonding amplified, highly sensitive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) sensing method for TGA detection using tris(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) (Ru(bpy)32+) as a luminophore and TGA as a self&#8208;co&#8208;reactant, via an anodic reaction at the Au electrode surface. Due to different molecular coordination environments of the TGA at the electrode surface, the ECL signal intensity of the developed ECL system gives much higher ECL signal in borate buffer than phosphate buffer of the same pH. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the ECL intensity has a direct relationship with the concentration of TGA in the range of 0.03&#8197;&#956;M to 300&#8197;&#956;M and a limit of detection of 0.013&#8197;&#956;M (3&#963;/m). The reported ECL system has further been applied for the detection of TGA in cosmetics with acceptable recoveries.

         <title>Electronic Circular Dichroism Imaging (ECDi) Casts a New Light on the Origin of Solid&#8208;State Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thanks to the concept of synchrotron radiation ECD imaging (SR&#8208;ECDi) applied to the active pharmaceutical ingredient Finasteride, we obtained an exclusive insight into the critical role played by the anisotropy of local domains in solid&#8208;state ECD spectra. Our findings open a new way to interpret solid&#8208;state chiroptical measurements and will broaden their application to probing and mapping solid chiral materials.

         <title>Linked Rotaxane Structure Restricts Local Molecular Motions in Solution to Enhance Fluorescence Properties of Tetraphenylethylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method to enhance the performance of fluorophores, with regards to properties such as fluorescence quantum yield and photostability, is reported in this work, using the fluorescent dye tetraphenylethylene. A linked rotaxane structure effectively prevents the local molecular motions of the fluorophore, leading to the enhancement of the performance.







Abstract
The restriction of local molecular motions is critical for improving the fluorescence quantum yields (FQYs) and the photostability of fluorescent dyes. Herein, we report a supramolecular approach to enhance the performance of fluorescent dyes by incorporating a linked rotaxane structure with permethylated &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrins. Tetraphenylethylene (TPE) derivatives generally exhibit low FQYs in solution due to the molecular motions in the excited state. We show that TPE with linked rotaxane structures on two sides displays up to 15&#8208;fold higher FQYs. Detailed investigations with variable temperature 1H NMR, UV&#8208;Vis, and photoluminescence spectroscopy revealed that the linked rotaxane structure rigidifies the TPE moiety and thus suppresses the local molecular motions and non&#8208;radiative decay. Moreover, the linked rotaxane structure enhances the FQY of the dye in various solvents, including aqueous solutions, and improves the photostability through the inhibition of local molecular motions in the excited TPE.

         <title>Regioselective Fluorination of Acenes: Tailoring of Molecular Electronic Levels and Solid&#8208;State Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling energy levels: Partial fluorination of tetracenes allows the precise adjustment of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels. By applying regioselective synthetic strategies, such functionalized tetracenes can be obtained, as demonstrated for the unilaterally fluorinated F3TET, F4TET and F5TET. The solid&#8208;state packing and optoelectronic properties of these materials are compared to the properties of their parental acenes.







Abstract
Optoelectronic properties of molecular solids are important for organic electronic devices and are largely determined by the adopted molecular packing motifs. In this study, we analyzed such structure&#8208;property relationships for the partially regioselective fluorinated tetracenes 1,2,12&#8208;trifluorotetracene, 1,2,10,12&#8208;tetrafluorotetracene and 1,2,9,10,11&#8208;pentafluorotetracene that were further compared with tetracene and perfluoro&#8208;tetracene. Quantum chemical DFT calculations in combination with optical absorption spectroscopy data show that the frontier orbital energies are lowered with the degree of fluorination, while their optical gap is barely affected. However, the crystal structure changes from a herringbone packing motif of tetracene towards a planar stacking motif of the fluorinated tetracene derivatives, which is accompanied by the formation of excimers and leads to strongly red&#8208;shifted photoluminescence with larger lifetimes.

         <title>Rhodium and Iridium Complexes of Anionic Thione and Selone Ligands Derived from Anionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>

         <dc:description>
Anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes that bear a weakly coordinating fluoroborate moiety have been used to prepare a new class of anionic imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;thione and &#8208;selone ligands; their coordination chemistry towards rhodium and iridium was explored to reveal their ability to develop secondary arene&#8211;metal interactions with the &#8220;wings&#8221; of the carbene ligands. More information about these new additions to the family of chalcogenolate ligands and their potential future application in coordination chemistry, bioinorganic chemistry and homogeneous catalysis can be found in the Research Article by M. Tamm et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104139).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hexaazatrianthracene (HATA) and hexaazatriphenylenehexacarbonitrile {HAT(CN)  6  } are reduced by metallic iron in the presence of crystal violet CVCl. Anionic ligands are produced, which simultaneously coordinate three Fe  II  Cl  2  to form (CV+)2{HATA&#215;(FeIICl2)3}2&#8208;&#215;3C6H4Cl2  (1) and (CV+)3{HAT(CN)6&#215;(FeIICl2)3}3&#8208;&#215;0.5CVCl&#215;2.5C6H4Cl2  (2). High&#8208;spin (  S  =2) FeII  atoms in both structures are arranged in equilateral triangles at a distance of 7&#160;&#197;. An antiferromagnetic exchange is observed between FeII  in {HATA&#215;(FeIICl2)3}2&#8208;  (1) with a Weiss temperature (  Q  ) of &#8208;80&#160;K, the PHI estimated exchange interaction (  J  ) is &#8208;4.7&#160;cm&#8208;1  . The {HAT(CN)6&#215;(FeIICl2)3}3&#8208;  assembly is obtained in  2  . The formation of HAT(CN)  6  &#183;3  &#8208;  is supported by the appearance of an intense EPR signal with  g  = 2.0037. The magnetic behavior of  2  is described by a strong antiferromagnetic coupling between the Fe  II  and HAT(CN)  6  &#183;3  &#8208;  spins with  J  1  = &#8208;164&#160;cm  &#8208;1  (&#8208;2  J  formalism) and by a weaker antiferromagnetic coupling between the Fe  II  spins with  J  2  = &#8208;15.4&#160;cm  &#8208;1  . The stronger coupling results in the spins of the three Fe  II  Cl  2  units to be aligned parallel to each other in the assembly. As a result, an increase of the  c  M  T  values is observed with the decrease of temperature from 9.82 at 300&#160;K up to 15.06&#160;emu&#215;K/mol at 6&#160;K, and  Q  = +23&#160;K. DFT calculations showed that, due to the high symmetry and nearly degenerated LUMO of both HATA and HAT(CN)  6  , their complexes with Fe  II  Cl  2  have a variety of closely lying excited high&#8208;spin states.</dc:description>

High-spin (  S  =2) FeII  atoms in both structures are arranged in equilateral triangles at a distance of 7&#160;&#197;. An antiferromagnetic exchange is observed between FeII  in {HATA&#215;(FeIICl2)3}2-  (1) with a Weiss temperature (  Q  ) of -80&#160;K, the PHI estimated exchange interaction (  J  ) is -4.7&#160;cm-1  . The {HAT(CN)6&#215;(FeIICl2)3}3-  assembly is obtained in  2  . The formation of HAT(CN)  6  &#183;3  -  is supported by the appearance of an intense EPR signal with  g  = 2.0037. The magnetic behavior of  2  is described by a strong antiferromagnetic coupling between the Fe  II  and HAT(CN)  6  &#183;3  -  spins with  J  1  = -164&#160;cm  -1  (-2  J  formalism) and by a weaker antiferromagnetic coupling between the Fe  II  spins with  J  2  = -15.4&#160;cm  -1  . The stronger coupling results in the spins of the three Fe  II  Cl  2  units to be aligned parallel to each other in the assembly. As a result, an increase of the  c  M  T  values is observed with the decrease of temperature from 9.82 at 300&#160;K up to 15.06&#160;emu&#215;K/mol at 6&#160;K, and  Q  = +23&#160;K. DFT calculations showed that, due to the high symmetry and nearly degenerated LUMO of both HATA and HAT(CN)  6  , their complexes with Fe  II  Cl  2  have a variety of closely lying excited high-spin states.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>The temperature monitoring  in vivo  plays a vital role in the investigation of biological processes of organisms and the improvement of disease theranostic methods. The development of lanthanide luminescent nanocomposite&#8208;derived temperature probes  in vivo  allows accurate and reliable interrogation of biological thermodynamic processes due to their superior photostability, high sensitivity, and non&#8208;invasive sensing fashion. This concept presented an overview of the recent development of lanthanide luminescent nanocomposite which are suitable for  in vivo  temperature monitoring, including the thermometric principles, key features, materials designs as well as their potential biomedical applications for non&#8208;invasive temperature detection in the living body.

         <title>Continuous Flow Bioconjugations of NIR&#8208;AZA Fluorophores via Strained Alkyne Cycloadditions with Intra&#8208;chip Fluorogenic Monitoring</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The importance of bioconjugation reactions continues to grow for cell specific targeting and dual therapeutic plus diagnostic medical applications.&#160; This necessitates the development of new bioconjugation chemistries, in&#8208;flow synthetic and analytical methods.&#160; With this goal, continuous flow bioconjugations were readily achieved with short residence times for strained alkyne substituted carbohydrate and therapeutic peptide biomolecules in reaction with azide and tetrazine substituted fluorophores.&#160; The strained alkyne substrates included substituted 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;D&#8208;glucopyranose, and the linear and cyclic peptide sequences QIRQQPRDPPTETLELEVSPDPAS&#8208;OH and c(RGDfK) respectively.&#160; The catalyst and reagent&#8208;free inverse electron demand tetrazine cycloadditions proved more favourable than the azide 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions. Reaction completion was achieved with residence times of 5 min at 40 &#176;C for tetrazine versus 10 min at 80 &#176;C for azide cycloadditions.&#160; The use of a fluorogenic tetrazine fluorophore, in a glass channelled reactor chip, allowed for intra&#8208;chip reaction monitoring by recording fluorescence intensities at various positions throughout the chip. As the Diels&#8208;Alder reactions proceeded through the chip, the fluorescence intensity increased accordingly in real&#8208;time.&#160; The application of continuous flow fluorogenic bioconjugations could offer an efficient translational access to theranostic agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Revisiting the Fundamental Nature of&#160;Metal&#8208;Ligand Bonding: An Impartial and&#160;Automated&#160;Fitting Procedure for Angular&#160;Overlap Model Parameters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The properties and reactivities of transition metal complexes are often discussed&#160;in terms of Ligand Field Theory (LFT), and with  ab initio  LFT a direct connection&#160;to quantum chemical wavefunctions was recently established. The Angular&#160;Overlap Model (AOM) is a widely used, ligand&#8208;specific parameterization scheme&#160;of the ligand field splitting which has however been restricted by the availability&#160;and resolution of experimental data. Using  ab initio  LFT, we present here a generalised,&#160;symmetry&#8208;independent and automated fitting procedure for AOM parameters&#160;that is even applicable to formally underdetermined or experimentally&#160;inaccessible systems. This method allows quantitative evaluations of assumptions&#160;commonly made in AOM applications, e.g. transferability or relative magnitudes&#160;of AOM parameters, and the response of the ligand field to structural&#160;or electronic changes. A two&#8208;dimensional spectrochemical series of tetrahedral&#160;halido metalates ([M  II  X  4  ]  2&#8208;  , M=Mn&#8211;Cu) served as a case study. A previously&#160;unknown linear relationship between the halide ligands&#8217; chemical hardness and&#160;their AOM parameters was found. The impartial and automated procedure for&#160;identifying AOM parameters introduced here can be used to systematically improve&#160;our understanding of ligand&#8208;metal interactions in coordination complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural insights into pixatimod (PG545) inhibition of heparanase, a key enzyme in cancer and viral infections</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pixatimod (PG545), a heparan sulfate (HS) mimetic and anticancer agent currently in clinical trials, is a potent inhibitor of heparanase. Heparanase is an endo &#8208;&#946;&#8208;glucuronidase that degrades HS in the extracellular matrix and basement membranes and is implicated in numerous pathological processes such as cancer and viral infections, including SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. To understand how PG545 interacts with heparanase, we firstly carried out a conformational analysis through a combination of NMR experiments and molecular modelling which showed that the reducing end &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;glucose residue of PG545 adopts a distorted conformation. This was followed by docking and molecular dynamics simulations to study the interactions of PG545 with heparanase, revealing that PG545 is able to block the active site by binding in different conformations, with the cholestanol side&#8208;chain making important hydrophobic interactions. While PG545 blocks its natural substrate HS from binding to the active site, small synthetic heparanase substrates are only partially excluded, and thus pentasaccharide or larger substrates are preferred for assaying this class of inhibitor. This study provides new insights for the design of next&#8208;generation heparanase inhibitors and substrates.</dc:description>

The presence of multiple Si&#8722;H functionalities in one molecule is used to generate at low temperatures oligosilane&#8208;based mono&#8208; and dications that are stabilized by intramolecular 3c2e Si&#8722;H&#8722;Si bridges. For the oligosilanylsilyl monocation, a rapid intramolecular Si&#8722;H group exchange is monitored by NMR spectroscopy at low temperatures. This dynamic process is not observed for the corresponding dication. According to the obtained NMR data, both cationic Si&#8722;H&#8722;Si bridges are electronically isolated by the trisilanyl backbone.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bridged oligosilanylsilyl borates 8&#8201;[B(C6F5)4], 9[B(C6F5)4] and diborates 10&#8201;[B(C6F5)4]2 have been prepared by hydride transfer between &#945;&#8208;&#969;&#8208;dihydrido&#8208; (11) and branched tetrahydrido&#8208;oligosilanes (13) and trityl cation. The obtained cyclic intramolecularly stabilized silylium ions 8, 9 and bissilylium ion 10 were characterized by low temperature NMR spectroscopy supported by the results of density functional calculations. The branched Si&#8722;H&#8722;Si monocation 9 undergoes at low temperatures a fast degenerate rearrangement, which exchanges the Si&#8722;H groups with a barrier of 31&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 via an antarafacial transition state. Reaction of the branched monocation 9 with a second equivalent of trityl cation or of the branched oligosilane 13 with two equivalents of trityl cation, gives at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C the corresponding bissilylium ion 10, an example for a new class of highly reactive poly&#8208;Lewis acids.

         <title>Calixarenes Incorporating Sulfonamide Moieties: Versatile Ligands for Carbonic Anhydrases Inhibition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calixarene derivatives bearing arms terminating with primary benzensulfonamides demonstrated their ability of inhibiting human Carbonic Anhydrases with significant efficiency and selectivity among different isoforms of the enzymes. A mode of binding where the benzensulfonamide arm penetrates into the funnel of the enzyme active site and interacts with the protein Zn2+ ion is supported by X&#8208;ray diffraction data and MD calculations.







Abstract
Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) continue to represent a relevant pharmaceutical target. The need of selective inhibitors and the involvement of these metalloenzymes in many multifaceted diseases boost the search for new ligands able to distinguish among the different CA isoforms, and for multifunctional systems simultaneously able to inhibit CAs and to interfere with other pathological events by interacting with additional targets. In this work, we successfully explored the possibility of preparing new CAs ligands by combining calixarenes with benzensulfonamide units. Inhibition tests towards three human CA isoforms evidenced, for some of the ligands, Ki values in the nanomolar range and promising selectivity. X&#8208;ray and molecular modeling studies provided information on the mode of binding of these calixarene derivatives. Thanks to the encouraging results and the structural features typical of the calixarene scaffold, it is then possible to plan for the future the design of multifunctional inhibitors for this class of widely spread enzymes.

         <title>BOPHY&#8208;Fullerene C60 Dyad as a Photosensitizer for Antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photosensitizer: The first BOPHY&#8211;fullerene C60 dyad (BP&#8208;C60) has been synthesized and obtained as two atropisomers. The presence of the BOPHY light&#8208;harvesting antenna in the dyad increases the absorption of the fullerene moiety in the visible region and improves its photodynamic action. Photoinduced energy/electron transfer processes (EnT/PeT) take place from BOPHY to fullerene C60. The dyad exhibits an efficient production of reactive oxygen species. BP&#8208;C60 is a promising heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free photosensitizer with potential application in photodynamic treatments..







Abstract
A novel BOPHY&#8211;fullerene C60 dyad (BP&#8208;C60) was designed as a heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free photosensitizer (PS) with potential uses in photodynamic treatment and reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated applications. BP&#8208;C60 consists of a BOPHY fluorophore covalently attached to a C60 moiety through a pyrrolidine ring. The BOPHY core works as a visible&#8208;light&#8208;harvesting antenna, while the fullerene C60 subunit elicits the photodynamic action. This fluorophore&#8211;fullerene cycloadduct, obtained by a straightforward synthetic route, was fully characterized and compared with its individual counterparts. The restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the BOPHY and pyrrolidine moieties led to the formation of two atropisomers. Spectroscopic, electrochemical, and computational studies disclose an efficient photoinduced energy/electron transfer process from BOPHY to fullerene C60. Photodynamic studies indicate that BP&#8208;C60 produces ROS by both photomechanisms (type&#8197;I and type&#8197;II). Moreover, the dyad exhibits higher ROS production efficiency than its individual constitutional components. Preliminary screening of photodynamic inactivation on bacteria models (Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli) demonstrated the ability of this dyad to be used as a heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free PS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that not only a BOPHY&#8211;fullerene C60 dyad is reported, but also that a BOPHY derivative is applied to photoinactivate microorganisms. This study lays the foundations for the development of new BOPHY&#8208;based PSs with plausible applications in the medical field.

The reaction features in situ protection and activation of an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acid by a hydrosilane. The copper enolate formed in situ reacts with a ketone to afford the &#946;&#8208;hydroxy carboxylic acid with excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99% ee). The corresponding gram&#8208;scale reaction with a low catalyst loading and the derivatization of the &#946;&#8208;hydroxy carboxylic acids highlight the practicality of this transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Rh&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling of Aldehydes with Allylboronates Enables Facile Access to Ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present herein a novel strategy for the preparation of ketones from aldehydes and allylic boronicesters. This reaction involves the allylation of aldehydes with allylic boronicesters and the Rh&#8208;catalyzed chain&#8208;walking of homoallylic alcohols. The key to this successful development is the protodeboronation of alkenyl borylether intermediate via a tetravalent borate anion species in the presence of KHF  2  and MeOH. This approach features mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, and excellent functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies also supported that the tandem allylation and chain&#8208;walking process was involved.</dc:description>

The bonding character, electron delocalization, and aromaticity of C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2) were studied by advanced theoretical means. The difference of electron delocalization between two sets of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems and significant influence of the number of &#8208;CO groups on them were focused on, and the essential reason for the distinct difference in molecular aromaticity was elucidated.







Abstract
The bonding character, electron delocalization, and aromaticity of the cyclo[18]carbon (C18) precursors, C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2), have been studied by combining quantum chemical calculations and various electronic wavefunction analyses with different physical bases. It was found that C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2) molecules exhibit alternating long and short C&#8722;C bonds, and have out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane dual &#960; systems (&#960;out and &#960;in) perpendicular to each other, which are consistent with the relevant characteristics of C18. However, the presence of carbonyl (&#8208;CO) groups significantly reduced the global electron conjugation of C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2) compared to C18. Specifically, the &#8208;CO group largely breaks the extensive delocalization of &#960;in system, and the &#960;out system is also affected by it but to a much lesser extent; as a consequence, C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2) with larger n shows weaker overall aromaticity. Mostly because of the decreased but still apparent &#960;out electron delocalization in the C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2), a notable diatropic induced ring current under the action of external magnetic field is observed, demonstrating the clear aromatic characteristic in the molecules. The correlation between C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2) and C18 in terms of the gradual elimination of &#8208;CO from the precursors showed that the direct elimination of two CO molecules in C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2) has a synergistic mechanism, but it is kinetically infeasible under normal conditions due to the high energy barrier.

         <title>Borane Adducts of Aromatic Phosphorus Heterocycles: Synthesis, Crystallographic Characterization and Reactivity of a Phosphinine&#8208;B(C6F5)3 Lewis Pair</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and crystallographic characterization of a phosphinine&#8208;borane adduct was achieved for the first time by using a Me3Si&#8208;functionalized phosphinine and the Lewis acid B(C6F5)3. This reaction strongly depends on the nature of the substituents in the &#945;&#8208;position of the phosphorus heterocycle. In contrast, the reaction of B2H6 with various substituted phosphinines leads to an equilibrium between the starting materials and the phosphinine&#8208;borane adducts, which is determined by the Lewis&#8208;basicity of the phosphinine. The novel phosphinine borane adduct (6&#8208;B(C6F5)3) shows rapid and facile insertion and [4+2] cycloaddition reactivity towards phenylacetylene. With styrene a hitherto unknown dihydro&#8208;1&#8208;phosphabarrelene is formed. The reaction with an ester provides a new, facile and selective route to 1&#8208;R&#8208;phosphininium salts. These salts then undergo a [4+2] cycloaddition in the presence of Me3Si&#8208;C&#8801;CH and styrene, respectively, to cleanly form unprecedented derivatives of 1&#8208;R&#8208;phosphabarrelenium salts.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrostatic perturbations in the substrate&#8208;binding pocket of taurine/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate dioxygenase determine its selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Taurine/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate dioxygenase is an important enzyme that takes part in the cysteine catabolism process in the human body and selectively hydroxylates taurine at the C  1  &#8208;position. Recent computational studies showed that in the gas&#8208;phase the C  2  &#8722;H bond of taurine is substantially weaker than the C  1  &#8722;H bond, yet no evidence exists of 2&#8208;hydroxytaurine products. To this end, we performed a detailed computational study on the selectivity patterns in TauD. The calculations show that the second&#8208;coordination sphere and the protonation states of residues play a major role in guiding the enzyme to the right selectivity. Specifically, a single proton on an active site histidine residue can change the regioselectivity of the reaction through its electrostatic perturbations in the active site and effectively changes the C  1  &#8722;H and C  2  &#8722;H bond strengths of taurine. This is further emphasized by many polar and hydrogen bonding interactions of the protein cage in TauD with the substrate and the oxidant that weaken the  pro  &#8208;  R  C  1  &#8722;H bond and triggers a chemoselective reaction process. Our large cluster models reproduce the experimental free energy of activation excellently.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8211;Iodide Complex on a Catalytically Active SiO2 Surface for One&#8208;Pot Hydrosilylation&#8211;CO2 Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface Rh&#8211;iodide complex for one&#8208;pot catalysis: A one&#8208;pot synthetic strategy for the hydrosilylation of olefin is developed. The hydrosilylation reaction is accelerated in the presence of a novel Rh&#8211;iodide complex developed on the surface of SiO2. The decrease in steric hindrance and electron donation from iodide to Rh promote the catalytic process.







Abstract
In this study, a novel Rh&#8211;iodide complex was synthesized through a surface reaction between an immobilized Rh cyclooctadiene complex and alkylammonium iodide (N+I&#8722;) on SiO2. In the presence of ammonium cations, the SiO2&#8208;supported Rh&#8211;iodide complex could be effectively used for the one&#8208;pot synthesis of various silylcarbonate derivatives starting from epoxy olefins, hydrosilanes, and CO2. The maximum turnover numbers (TONs) for the hydrosilylation reaction and the CO2 cycloaddition were 7600 (Rh) and 130 (N+I&#8722;), respectively. The catalyst exhibited much higher performance for hydrosilylation than solely the Rh complex on SiO2. The mechanism of the Rh&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation reaction and the local structure of Rh, which is affected by the co&#8208;immobilized N+I&#8722;, were investigated by using Rh and I K&#8208;edge XAFS and XPS.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A surface Rh&#8211;iodide complex for one-pot catalysis&lt;/b&gt;: A one-pot synthetic strategy for the hydrosilylation of olefin is developed. The hydrosilylation reaction is accelerated in the presence of a novel Rh&#8211;iodide complex developed on the surface of SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The decrease in steric hindrance and electron donation from iodide to Rh promote the catalytic process.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, a novel Rh&#8211;iodide complex was synthesized through a surface reaction between an immobilized Rh cyclooctadiene complex and alkylammonium iodide (N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) on SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In the presence of ammonium cations, the SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-supported Rh&#8211;iodide complex could be effectively used for the one-pot synthesis of various silylcarbonate derivatives starting from epoxy olefins, hydrosilanes, and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The maximum turnover numbers (TONs) for the hydrosilylation reaction and the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cycloaddition were 7600 (Rh) and 130 (N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;), respectively. The catalyst exhibited much higher performance for hydrosilylation than solely the Rh complex on SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The mechanism of the Rh-catalyzed hydrosilylation reaction and the local structure of Rh, which is affected by the co-immobilized N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, were investigated by using Rh and I K-edge XAFS and XPS. Analysis of the XAFS profiles indicated the presence of a Rh&#8722;I bond. The Rh unit was in its electron-rich state. Curve-fitting analysis of the Rh K-edge EXAFS profiles suggests dissociation of the cycloocta-1,5-diene (COD) ligand from the Rh center. Results from spectroscopic and kinetic analyses revealed that the high activity of the catalyst (during hydrosilylation) could be attributed to a decrease in steric hindrance and the electron-rich state of the Rh. The decrease in the steric hindrance could be attributed to the absence of COD, and the electron-rich state promoted the oxidative addition of Si&#8722;H. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of a one-pot silylcarbonate synthesis as well as a determination of a novel surface Rh&#8211;iodide complex and its catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Z&#8208;Scheme In2S3/NU&#8208;1000 Heterojunction for Boosting Photo&#8208;Oxidation of Sulfide into Sulfoxide under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of In2S3/NU&#8208;1000&#8201;heterojunction photocatalysts was constructed via a solvothermal method, which efficiently catalyzes the oxidation of sulfides to form sulfoxides as the sole product under LED lamp (full&#8208;spectrum) illumination in air at room temperature. Especially, the sulfur mustard simulant, 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES), can also be photocatalytically oxidized with In2S3/NU&#8208;1000 to afford nontoxic 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfoxide (CEESO) selectively and effectively.







Abstract
Photocatalytic oxidation of sulfide into sulfoxide has attracted extensive attention as an environmentally friendly strategy for chemical transformations or toxic chemicals degradation. Herein, we construct a series of In2S3/NU&#8208;1000 heterojunction photocatalysts, which can efficiently catalyze the oxidation of sulfides to form sulfoxides as the sole product under LED lamp (full&#8208;spectrum) illumination in air at room temperature. Especially, the sulfur mustard simulant, 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES), can also be photocatalytically oxidized with In2S3/NU&#8208;1000 to afford nontoxic 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfoxide (CEESO) selectively and effectively. In contrast, individual NU&#8208;1000 and In2S3 show very low catalytic activity on this reaction. The significantly improved photocatalytic activity is ascribed to the constructing of an efficient Z&#8208;scheme photocatalysts In2S3/NU&#8208;1000, which exhibits the enhancement of light harvesting, the promotion of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole separation, and the retention of high porosity of the parent MOF. Moreover, mechanism studies in photocatalytic oxidation reveal that the superoxide radical (.O2&#8722;) and singlet oxygen (1O2) are the main oxidative species in the oxidation system. This work exploits the opportunities for the construction of porous Z&#8208;scheme photocatalysts based on the photoactive MOFs materials and inorganic semiconductors for promoting catalytic organic transformations. More importantly, it provides a route to the rational design of efficient photocatalysts for the detoxification of mustard gas.

         <title>A solid support&#8208;based synthetic strategy for the site&#8208;selective functionalization of peptides with organometallic half&#8208;sandwich moieties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The number of donor atoms available on peptides that can competitively coordinate to metal centers renders the site&#8208;selective generation of advanced metal&#8211;peptide conjugates in high purity a challenging venture. Herein, we present a transmetalation&#8208;based synthetic approach on solid support in which an imidazolium proligand can be used to selectively anchor a range of transition metal half&#8208;sandwich complexes onto peptides in the presence of multiple coordinative motifs. Amenable to solid support, a range of N&#8208;terminus and/or lysine conjugated metal&#8208;peptide conjugates were obtained in high purity after cleavage from the resin. The metalated peptides were evaluated for their anticancer properties against human cancer cell lines. While no cytotoxic activity was observed, this platform has the potential to i) provide a pathway to site&#8208;selective peptide labelling, ii) be explored as a biorthogonal handle and/or iii) generate a new strategy for ligand design in transition metal catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>211At and 125I&#8208;labeling of (hetero)aryliodonium ylides: astatine wins again</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the growing interest in radioiodine and  211  At&#8208;labeled radiopharmaceuticals, the search for radiolabeling reactions has been somewhat neglected, resulting in a limited number of available radiosynthetic strategies. Herein we report a comparative study of nucleophilic  125  I and  211  At&#8208;labeling of aryliodonium ylides. Whereas radioiodination efficiency was low,  211  At&#8208;labeling performed efficiently on a broad scope of precursors. The most activated aryliodonium ylides led rapidly to quantitative reactions at room temperature in acetonitrile. For deactivated precursors, heating up to 90&#176;C in glyme and addition of 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl (TEMPO) as radical scavenger appeared essential to avoid precursor degradation and to achieve high radiochemical yields and molar activity. The approach was applied successfully to the preparation of 4&#8208;[  211  At]astatophenylalanine (4&#8208;APA), an amino acid derivative increasingly studied as radiotherapeutic drug for cancers. This validated aryliodonium ylides as a valuable tool for nucleophilic  211  At&#8208;labeling and will complement the short but now growing list of available astatination reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Driven Molecular Switches and Motors: Recent Developments and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by human vision, a diverse range of light&#8208;driven molecular switches and motors has been developed for fundamental understanding and application in material science and biology. Recently, the design and synthesis of visible light&#8208;driven molecular switches and motors have been actively pursued. This emerging trend is partly motivated to avoid the harmful effects of ultraviolet light, which was necessary to drive the classical molecular switches and motors at least in one direction, impeding their employment in biomedical and photopharmacology applications. Moreover, visible light&#8208;driven molecular switches and motors are demonstrated to enable benign optical materials for advanced photonic devices. Therefore, during the past several years, visible light&#8208;driven molecular switches based on azobenzene derivatives, diarylethenes, 1,2&#8208;dicyanodithienylethenes, hemithioindigo derivatives, iminothioindoxyls, donor&#8211;acceptor Stenhouse adducts, and overcrowded alkene based molecular motors have been judiciously designed, synthesized, and used in the development of functional materials and systems for a wide range of applications. In this Review, we present the recent developments toward the design of visible light&#8208;driven molecular switches and motors, with their applications in the fabrication of functional materials and systems in material science, bioscience, pharmacology,  etc  . The visible light&#8208;driven molecular switches and motors realized so far undoubtedly widen the scope of these interesting compounds for technological and biological applications. We hope this Review article could provide additional impetus and inspire further research interests for future exploration of visible light&#8208;driven advanced materials, systems, and devices.</dc:description>

         <title>A masked form of an O&#8208;borylated Breslow intermediate for the diastereoselective FLP&#8208;type activation of aldehydes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Breslow intermediates are very often elusive species whose application in Frustrated Lewis Pair chemistry is unprecedented. We describe herein the use of a masked form of an O&#8208;Borylated Breslow (OBB) intermediate that performs FLP&#8208;type activation of the carbonyl function of five different benzaldehyde derivatives with complete diastereoselectivity. The resulting compounds are characterised in solution by NMR spectroscopy (compounds  4  &#8208;  8  ) and in solid state by X&#8208;Ray diffraction analysis (compounds  4  &#8208;  6  ). A combined kinetic and theoretical investigation reveals the associative nature of the rate determining step and suggests that the OBB intermediate part is never released during the whole process.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel lipophilic fluorophores with highly acidity&#8208;dependent two&#8208;photon response</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lipophilic fluorophores are widely implemented in nonlinear microscopy; however, few existing membrane&#8208;specific probes combine high brightness of two&#8208;photon excited fluorescence (2PEF) with pH sensitivity. Here we describe four novel two&#8208;photon excited fluorophores, based on a coumarin 151 core structure, where lipophilicity is induced by a covalently attached phosphazene moiety. Changing the environmental acidity using trifluoromethanesulfonic (triflic) acid leads to profound changes in the linear fluorescence and 2PEF characteristics, due to chromophores&#8217; switching between neutral&#8208; and protonated forms. We characterize this dependence by measuring the two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) spectra over the region  &#955;  2PA  = 550 &#8211; 1000 nm, observing 2PA cross sections of  &#963;  2PA  = 10 &#8211; 20 GM, with associated 2PEF brightness of 10 &#8211; 13 GM, in neutral solutions of both acetonitrile and  n  &#8208;octanol. Although quantum chemical modelling and NMR measurements show that, at high chromophore concentrations, protonation may be accompanied by a dimerization process, these dimers likely do not form at the lower concentrations used in optical spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>A Redox&#8208;active Microporous Organosiloxane Containing a Stable Neutral Radical, Trioxotriangulene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new silyl&#8208;substituted trioxotriangulene (  TOT  ) neutral radical and corresponding porous organosiloxanes (POSs) were synthesized. The neutral radical exhibited a peculiarly high stability and formed a diamagnetic &#960;&#8208;dimer characteristic to  TOT  neutral radicals stabilized by the strong multiple SOMO&#8208;SOMO interaction in both solution and solid states. POSs including  TOT  units within the organosiloxane&#8208;wall were prepared by polycondensation of the silyl groups, and formed microporous structures with ~1 nm&#8208;size diameters. Redox ability of  TOT  units in the POS was demonstrated by the treatment of oxidant/reductant in heterogeneous suspension condition, where the  TOT  units were reversibly converted between reduced and neutral radical species. Furthermore, the solid&#8208;state electrochemical measurements of the POS revealed the reversible multi&#8208;stage redox ability of  TOT  units involving polyanionic species within the organosiloxane&#8208;wall.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyanide&#8208;Free Cyanation of sp2 and sp&#8208;Carbons by Oxazole based Masked CN Source Using Flow Microreactors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein report a cyanide&#8208;free continuous&#8208;flow process for cyanation of sp  2  and sp carbons to synthesize aryl, vinyl and acetylenic nitriles from (5&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;phenyloxazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl) boronic acid [OxBA] reagent as a sole source of carbon&#8208;bound masked &#8208;CN source. Non&#8208;toxic and stable OxBA reagent is generated by lithiation&#8208;borylation of bromo&#8208;oxazole, and the consecutive Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling with aryl, vinyl, or acetylenic halides and demasking [4 + 2]/retro&#8208;[4 + 2] sequence were successfully accomplished to give the desired cyano compounds with reasonably good yields in a four&#8208;step flow manner. A unique feature of this cyanation protocol in flow enables to cyanate a variety of sp  2  and sp carbons to produce a broad spectrum of aryl acetonitrile. It is envisaged that the OxBA based cyanation would replace existing unstable and toxic approaches as well as non&#8208;toxic cyanation using two different sources of &#8220;C&#8221; and &#8220;N&#8221; to incorporate the &#8208;CN group.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first chiral multi&#8208;layer 3D folding polymers have been assembled and regulated by both uniformed and differentiated aromatic chromophoric units between naphthyl piers. Screening catalysts, catalytic systems and monomers was proven to be crucial for asymmetric catalytic Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura poly&#8208;couplings for this assembly. X&#8208;ray crystallography of corresponding dimers and trimers revealed the absolute stereochemistry and the intermolecular packing pattern. Up to 61,960 M w /41,900 M n and m / z = 4317 for polymers and oligomers as confirmed by GPC and MALDI&#8208;TOF MS indicated that the present frameworks were composed of multiple layers stacked. The resulting multiple &#960;&#8208;assemblies exhibited remarkable optical properties in aggregated states (PL in solids and AIE in solutions), as well as reversible redox properties in electrochemical performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrazone Photoswitches for Structural Modulation of Short Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecules that undergo light&#8208;driven structural transformations constitute the core components in photoswitchable molecular systems and materials. Among various families of photoswitches, photochromic hydrazones have recently emerged as a novel class of photoswitches with superb properties, such as high photochemical conversion, spectral tunability, thermal stability, and fatigue resistance. Hydrazone photoswitches have been adopted in various adaptive materials at different length scales, however, their utilization for modulating biomolecules still has not been explored. Herein we present new hydrazone switches that can photomodulate the structures of short peptides. Systematic investigation on a set of hydrazone derivatives revealed that installation of the amide group does not significantly alter the photoswitching behaviors. Importantly, a hydrazone switch comprising an upper phenyl ring and a lower quinolinyl ring was effective for structural control of peptides. We anticipate that this work, as a new milestone in the research of hydrazone switches, will open a new avenue for structural and functional control of biomolecules.</dc:description>

Thanks to the rigid, spherical cavity with a diameter of ~1 nm, azobenzene and stilbene derivatives are quantitatively encapsulated by the capsule with 100%&#160;  cis  &#8208;selectivity in water. The isomerization of the&#160;  cis  &#8208;azo compound is suppressed against heat and light in the cavity, due to the confinement effect. Furthermore,&#160;  C,N  &#8208;diphenyl imine derivatives are quantitatively encapsulated by the capsule in water and adopt an otherwise unstable&#160;  cis  &#8208;form. The polyaromatic cavity suppresses the hydrolysis of the imines in water, even at elevated temperature, due to the shielding effect. Accordingly, the properties of the&#160;  cis&#8208;trans  &#160; isomers &#160;could be largely altered through supramolecular manipulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Heteropolymetallic Architectures as Snapshots of Transmetallation Processes at Different Degrees of Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel heteropolymetallic architectures have been built by integrating Pd, Au and Ag systems. The dinuclear [(CNC)(PPh 3 )Pd&#8208; G11 M(PPh 3 )](ClO 4 ) ( G11 M = Au ( 3 ), Ag ( 4 ); CNC = 2,6&#8208;diphenylpyridinate) and trinuclear [{(CNC)(PPh 3 )Pd} 2 G11 M](ClO 4 ) ( G11 M = Au ( 6 ), Ag ( 5 )) complexes have been accessed or isolated. Structural and DFT characterization unveil striking interactions of one of the aryl groups of the CNC ligand(s) with the G11 M center, suggesting these complexes constitute models of transmetallation processes. Further analyses allow to qualitatively order the degree of transfer, proving that Au promotes the highest one and also that Pd systems favor higher degrees than Pt. Consistently, Energy Decomposition Analysis calculations show that the interaction energies follow the order Pd&#8208;Au &gt; Pt&#8208;Au &gt; Pd&#8208;Ag &gt; Pt&#8208;Ag. All these results offer potentially useful ideas for the design of bimetallic catalytic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanosized Carbon Macrocycles Based on a Planar Chiral Pseudo Meta&#8208; [2.2]Paracyclophane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Structural designs combining cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) backbone with planar chiral [2.2]Paracyclophane ([2.2]PCP) lead to optical&#8208;active chiral macrocycles with intriguing properties. X&#8208;ray crystal analysis revealed aesthetic necklace&#8208;shaped structures and size&#8208;dependent packages with long&#8208;range channels. The macrocycles exhibit unique photophysical properties with high fluorescence quantum yield of up to 82%, and the fluorescent color varies with ring size. In addition, size&#8208;dependent chiroptical properties with moderately large CPL dissymmetry factor of 10  &#8208;3  and CPL brightness in the range of 30 &#8208; 40 M  &#8208;1  cm  &#8208;1  were observed.</dc:description>

         <title>Computational Insights on Allosteric Effect and Dynamic Structural Feature of SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 Spike Protein</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>COVID&#8208;19 caused by SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 is currently continuing to surge globally. The spike (S) protein is the key protein of SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 that recognizes and binds to the host target ACE2. In this study, molecular dynamics simulation was used to elucidate the allosteric effect of S protein. The binding of ACE2 caused a centripetal movement of the receptor&#8208;binding domain of the S protein. The dihedral changes of Phe329 and Phe515 played a key role in this process. Two potential cleavage sites S1/S2 and S2' were exposed on the surface after the binding of ACE2. The binding affinity of SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 S protein and ACE2 was significantly higher than that of SARS&#8208;COV. This was mainly due to the mutation of Asp480 in SARS&#8208;COV to Ser494 in SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2, which greatly weakened the electrostatic repulsion. The result provides theoretical basis for the SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 infection and aids the development of biosensors and detection reagents.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical Modulation on Optical Anisotropy Driven by Metal Cation Polyhedra in Fluorooxoborates MIIB4O6F2 (MII = Be, Mg, Pb, Zn, Cd)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enhancement mechanism of birefringence is very important to modulate optical anisotropy and materials design. Herein, the different cations extending from alkaline&#8208;earth to alkaline&#8208;earth,  d  10  electron configuration, and 6s  2  lone pair cations are highlighted to explore the influence on the birefringence. A flexible fluorooxoborate framework  from AEB  4  O  6  F  2  (AE = Ca, Sr) is adopted for UV/deep&#8208;UV birefringent structures, namely, M  II  B  4  O  6  F  2  (M  II  = Be, Mg, Pb, Zn, Cd). The maximal enhancement on birefringence can reach 46.6% with the cation substitution from Ca, Sr to Be, Mg (  route&#8208;I  ), Pb (route&#8208;II), and Zn, Cd (route&#8208;III). The influence of the cation size, the stereochemically active lone pair, and the binding capability of metal cation polyhedra is investigated for the hierarchical improvement on birefringence. Significantly, the BeB  4  O  6  F  2  structure features the shortest UV cutoff edge 146 nm among the available anhydrous beryllium borates with birefringence over 0.1 at 1064 nm  ,  and the PbB  4  O  6  F  2  structure has the shortest UV cutoff edge 194 nm within the reported anhydrous lead borates that hold birefringence larger than 0.1 at 1064 nm. This work sheds light on how metal cation polyhedra modulate birefringence, which suggests a credible design strategy to obtain desirable birefringent structures by cation control.</dc:description>
