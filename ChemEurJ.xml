         <title>Reversible coupling of germylone with isocyanates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The germylone dimNHCGe (5, dimNHC = diimino N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) undergoes a [2+2] cycloaddition with isocyanates RNCO (R = 4&#8208;tolyl or 3,5&#8208;xylyl) to furnish novel alkyl carboxamido germylenes 6 (R=4&#8208;tolyl) and 7 (R= 3,5&#8208;xylyl), featuring a C&#8208;C bond between the former carbene carbon and the isocyanate moiety. Heating a mixture of 7 with 4&#8208;tolyl isocyanate to 100 &#176;C results in isocyanate metathesis, demonstrating reversible C&#8208;C bond formation on the reduced germanium compound. DFT calculations suggest that this process occurs via the reductive dissociation of isocyanate from 8 that regenerates the parent Ge(0) compound 5.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium catalyzed carbonylation reaction of indole/pyrrole involving HCFO&#8208;1233zd (E)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>3&#8208;Idolenone is a key intermediate in the synthesis of many drugs and plays an important role in synthetic chemistry and biochemistry. A new method for the synthesis of trifluoromethylated 3&#8208;indolenones by carbonylation catalyzed by Pd(0) is described. In the absence of an additive, 1&#8208;chloro&#8208;3,3,3&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;propylene (an inexpensive ozone&#8208;friendly CF3 structural unit) reacts with indole and carbon monoxide to synthesize trifluoromethylatedindolenone in good yield, regioselectivity and chemoselectivity and with strong resistance to basal functional groups such as alkynes, aldehydes and esters. Notably, in addition to indole compounds being well transformed into the corresponding products, pyrrole, heteroindole can also is also suitable for the corresponding chemical transformation. This study provides a scientific method for the late construction of trifluoromethylated indole/pyrrole 3&#8208;ketene.</dc:description>

         <title>Signal Transduction Allows Temporal Control of the Potential of a Concentration Cell Driven by the Decarboxylation of an Activated Carboxylic Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anthropomorphic nitroacetic acid puts a plug into a socket turning a light bulb ON. After its time&#8208;controlled degradation to nitromethane and CO2, the light bulb is no longer connected to the socket and turns OFF. A time&#8208;controllable pH signal is transduced in a time&#8208;controllable voltage signal, which can be exploited to govern electric devices. More information can be found in the Research Article by G. Capocasa, S. Di&#8197;Stefano and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303897).

         <title>Efficient Synthesis and Structural Analysis of Chiral 4,4'&#8208;Biazulene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>4,4'&#8208;Biazulene is a potentially attractive key component of an axially chiral biaryl compound, however, its structure and properties have not been clarified owing to the lack of its efficient synthesis.&#160;We report a breakthrough in the reliable synthesis&#160;of 4,4'&#8208;biazulene, which is achieved by the access to azulen&#8208;4&#8208;ylboronic acid pinacol ester and 4&#8208;iodoazulene as novel key synthetic intermediates for the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction.&#160;The X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of 4,4'&#8208;biazulene confirmed its axial chirality.&#160;The enantiomers of 4,4'&#8208;biazulene were successfully resolved by HPLC on the chiral stationary phase column.&#160;The kinetic experiments and DFT calculations indicate that&#160;the racemization energy barrier of 4,4'&#8208;biazulene is comparable to that of 1,1'&#8208;binaphthyl.</dc:description>

         <title>Evaluating Diazene to N2 Interconversion at Iron&#8208;Sulfur Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biological N2&#160;reduction occurs at sulfur&#8208;rich multiiron sites, and an interesting potential pathway is concerted double reduction/protonation of bridging N2&#160;through PCET. Here, we test the feasibility of using synthetic sulfur&#8208;supported diiron complexes to mimic this pathway. Oxidative proton transfer from &#956;&#8208;&#951;1:&#951;1&#8208;diazene (HN=NH) is the microscopic reverse of the proposed N2&#160;fixation pathway, revealing the energetics of the process. Previously, Sellmann assigned the purple metastable product from two&#8208;electron oxidation of [{Fe2+(PPr3)L1}2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;1:&#951;1&#8208;N2H2)] (L1&#160;= tetradentate SSSS ligand) at &#8722;78 &#176;C as [{Fe2+(PPr3)L1}2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;1:&#951;1&#8208;N2)]2+, which would come from double PCET from diazene to sulfur atoms of the supporting ligands. Using resonance Raman, M&#246;ssbauer, NMR, and EPR spectroscopies in conjunction with DFT calculations, we show that the product is not an N2&#160;complex. Instead, the data are most consistent with the spectroscopically observed species being the mononuclear iron(III) diazene complex [{Fe(PPr3)L1}(&#951;2&#8208;N2H2)]+. Calculations indicate that the proposed double PCET has a barrier that is too high for proton transfer at the reaction temperature, and is so exergonic&#160;that it would be irreversible as a result of the high Fe3+/2+&#160;redox potential. This system establishes the "ground rules" for designing reversible N2/N2H2&#160;interconversion through PCET, such as tuning the redox potentials of the metal sites.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to well&#8208;defined structure as well as easy synthesis and modification, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as promising catalysts for tandem reactions. In this article, we aim to summarize the development of multifunctional MOFs, including mixed metal MOFs, MOFs that are synergistically catalyzed by metal nodes and organic linkers, MOFs loaded with metal nanoparticles, etc, as heterogenous catalysts for tandem reactions over the past five years. This concept briefly discusses on present challenges, future trends, and prospects of multifunctional MOFs catalysts in tandem reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>TBADT&#8208;Mediated Photocatalytic Stereoselective Radical Alkylation of Chiral N&#8208;Sulfinyl Imines: Towards Efficient Synthesis of Diverse Chiral Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we describe a sustainable and efficient photocatalytic method for the stereoselective radical alkylation of chiral sulfinyl imines. By employing readily available non&#8208;prefunctionalized radical precursors and low loading of TBADT as a direct HAT photocatalyst, we successfully obtain diverse chiral amines with high yields and excellent diastereoselectivity under mild conditions. This method provides an efficient approach for accessing a diverse array of medicinally relevant compounds, including both natural and synthetic &#945;&#8208;amino acids, aryl ethyl amines, and other structural motifs commonly found in approved pharmaceuticals and natural product.</dc:description>

         <title>The impact of stoichiometry on the initial steps of crystal formation: Stability and lifetime of charged triple&#8208;ion complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charged Triple&#8208;Ion Clusters (CTICs) form by addition of an anion or cation to an ion pair and are intermediate species on ionic&#8208;crystal nucleation pathways. Computations show that the energies and lifetimes for positive and negative CTICs vary differently for BaSO4 and CaCO3. This difference can be related to asymmetrical nucleation behavior observed in solutions with cation&#8208; versus with anion excess.







Abstract
Minerals form in natural systems from solutions with varying ratios of their lattice ions, yet non&#8208;stoichiometric conditions have generally been overlooked in investigations of new formation (nucleation) of ionic crystals. Here, we investigated the influence of cation:anion ratio in the solution on the initial steps of nucleation by studying positively and negatively charged triple ion complexes and subsequent particle size evolution. Our model systems are carbonates and sulfates of calcium and barium, as it was recently shown that solution stoichiometry affects the timing and rate of their nucleation. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and dynamic light scattering (DLS) flow experiments show that nucleation correlates with the stability and lifetime of the initial complexes, which were significantly impacted by the cation:anion stoichiometry and ion type. Specifically, 
 was found to have higher association constants and its lifetime was twofold longer than

 and 
. Contrastingly, for 
, 
 was found to have lower association constants and its lifetime was shorter than 
. These trends in stability and lifetime follow the same asymmetrical behaviour as observed experimentally for particle formation using techniques like DLS. This suggests a causal relationship between the stability and lifetime of the initial charged complexes and the nucleation under non&#8208;stoichiometric conditions.

         <title>Recent Advances of Flexible MXene and its Composites for Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXene has significant potential as an electrode material for supercapacitors due to its high conductivity, excellent mechanical properties, and rich surface chemical properties. This paper reviews the synthesis, preparation, performance, and electrochemical reaction mechanism of flexible MXenes; Summarized the latest progress in freestanding flexible MXene composites for supercapacitors, as well as the challenges and possible improvements in their practical applications.







Abstract
MXenes have unique properties such as high electrical conductivity, excellent mechanical properties, rich surface chemistry, and convenient processability. These characteristics make them ideal for producing flexible materials with tunable microstructures. This paper reviews the laboratory research progress of flexible MXene and its composite materials for supercapacitors. And introduces the general synthesis method of MXene, as well as the preparation and properties of flexible MXene. By analyzing the current research status, the electrochemical reaction mechanism of MXene was explained from the perspectives of electrolyte and surface terminating groups. This review particularly emphasizes the composite methods of freestanding flexible MXene composite materials. The review points out that the biggest problem with flexible MXene electrodes is severe self&#8208;stacking, which reduces the number of chemically active sites, weakens ion accessibility, and ultimately lowers electrochemical performance. Therefore, it is necessary to composite MXene with other electrode materials and design a good microstructure. This review affirms the enormous potential of flexible MXene and its composite materials in the field of supercapacitors. In addition, the challenges and possible improvements faced by MXene based materials in practical applications were also discussed.

         <title>Amorphous Anode Materials for Fast&#8208;charging Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous materials have emerged as effective solutions to enhance the fast charging performance of anodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The concept summarizes the recent strides made in this emerging field and outlines the various strategies employed for designing anodes to incorporate amorphous materials. The challenges and future prospects have also been discussed.







Abstract
Fast&#8208;charging technology is set to revolutionize the field of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), driving the creation of next&#8208;generation devices with the ability to get charged within a short span of time. From the anode perspective, it is of paramount importance to design materials that can withstand continuous Li+ insertion/deinsertion at high charging rates and still remain unaffected by factors such as mechanical fractures, electrolyte side reactions, polarisation, lithium plating and heat generation. Herein, the recent advancements in the design of amorphous materials as anodes for fast&#8208;charging LIBs have been discussed. While the development of this particular class of materials for application in high&#8208;rate anodes has been paid limited attention in recent literature, it holds immense promise for improving the fast&#8208;charging capabilities. This concept summarizes the recent strides made in this emerging field, outlining the strategies employed in the design of amorphous anodes and emphasizing the crucial role played by the amorphous nature in achieving fast&#8208;charging performance. Further, the successive initiatives that can be undertaken to drive the progress of amorphous materials for fast charging LIBs have also been detailed, which could potentially improve their commercial viability.

         <title>Exceptional capture of methane at low pressure by an iron&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MFM&#8208;300(Fe) shows exceptional high uptake of CH4 at low pressure, which enables the highly efficient capture of CH4 and separation of CH4/N2 under ambient conditions. The unique and strong binding interaction between MFM&#8208;300(Fe) and CH4 is revealed structurally via complementary experimental techniques coupled with modelling.







Abstract
The selective capture of methane (CH4) at low concentrations and its separation from N2 are extremely challenging owing to the weak host&#8208;guest interactions between CH4 molecules and any sorbent material. Here, we report the exceptional adsorption of CH4 at low pressure and the efficient separation of CH4/N2 by MFM&#8208;300(Fe). MFM&#8208;300(Fe) shows a very high uptake for CH4 of 0.85&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;mbar and 298&#8197;K and a record CH4/N2 selectivity of 45 for porous solids, representing a new benchmark for CH4 capture and CH4/N2 separation. The excellent separation of CH4/N2 by MFM&#8208;300(Fe) has been confirmed by dynamic breakthrough experiments. In&#8197;situ neutron powder diffraction, and solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopies, coupled with modelling, reveal a unique and strong binding of CH4 molecules involving Fe&#8722;OH&#8943;CH4 and C&#8943;phenyl ring interactions within the pores of MFM&#8208;300(Fe), thus promoting the exceptional adsorption of CH4 at low pressure.

Tackling the Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products (RAGE) inhibition via Dynamic Combinatorial Chemistry (DCC). Leveraging protein recognition, in the presence of a continually self&#8208;correcting, evolving dynamic library, we were able to find novel ligands for RAGE. Our biological tests confirmed their superior affinities, as well as potential as antagonists, a fresh perspective for inhibiting this multifaceted and inflammation&#8208;associated receptor.







Abstract
RAGE is a transmembrane receptor of immunoglobulin family that can bind various endogenous and exogenous ligands, initiating the inflammatory downstream signaling pathways, including inflammaging. Therefore, RAGE represents an attractive drug target for age&#8208;related diseases. For the development of small&#8208;molecule RAGE antagonists, we employed protein&#8208;templated dynamic combinatorial chemistry (ptDCC) using RAGE&#8242;s VC1 domain as a template, the first application of this approach in the context of RAGE. The affinities of DCC hits were validated using microscale thermophoresis. Subsequent screening against AGE2 (glyceraldehyde&#8208;modified AGE)&#8208;sRAGE (solubleRAGE) (AGE2&#8208;BSA/sRAGE) interaction using ELISA tests led to the identification of antagonists with micromolar potency. Our findings not only demonstrate the successful application of ptDCC on RAGE but also highlight its potential to address the pressing need for alternative strategies for the development of small&#8208;molecule RAGE antagonists, an area of research that has experienced a slowdown in recent years.

         <dc:description>
An asymmetric double desymmetrization reaction has been realized through vinylogous Michael addition reaction of prochiral &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dicyanocyclohexane to 2,2&#8208;disubstituted cyclopentene&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione catalyzed by a chiral Ag&#8208;(R)&#8208;DTBM&#8208;SEGPHOS catalyst. This method enables the formation of four chiral centers, including an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter in a single C&#8722;C bond formation event.







Abstract
An asymmetric double desymmetrization methodology has been developed for synthesizing densely functionalized chiral cyclopentylcyclohexane scaffolds. We have constructed four chiral centers, including an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter in a single C&#8722;C bond formation event. The methodology has high functional&#8208;group tolerance and delivers a broad range of enantioenriched products. This vinylogous Michael addition reaction of prochiral &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dicyanocyclohexane to 2,2&#8208;disubstituted cyclopentene&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione is catalyzed by a chiral Ag&#8208;(R)&#8208;DTBM&#8208;SEGPHOS catalyst.

         <title>Geometric and Electronic Engineering in Co/VN Nanoparticles to Boost Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalysis for Aqueous/Flexible Zn&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Co/VN@NC nanofoam exhibits a competitive difference (0.65 V) between the half&#8208;wave potential of ORR and OER potential at 10 mA cm&#8722;2, leading to an elevated peak power density (156/85 mW cm&#8722;2) in aqueous/flexible ZABs. It is attributed to the disordered carbon reinforcing the confinement of electrons, and the coupling of components optimizing the absorption of intermediates.







Abstract
Modulating metal&#8208;metal and metal&#8208;support interactions is one of the potent tools for augmenting catalytic performance. Herein, highly active Co/VN nanoparticles are well dispersed on three&#8208;dimensional porous carbon nanofoam (Co/VN@NC) with the assistance of dicyandiamide. Studies certify that the consequential disordered carbon substrate reinforces the confinement of electrons, while the coupling of diverse components optimizes charge redistribution among species. Besides, theoretical analyses confirm that the regulated electron configuration can significantly tune the binding strength between the active sites and intermediates, thus optimizing reaction energy barriers. Therefore, Co/VN@NC exhibits a competitive potential difference (&#916;E, 0.65&#8197;V) between the half&#8208;wave potential of ORR and OER potential at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, outperforming Pt/C+RuO2 (0.67&#8197;V). Further, catalyst&#8208;based aqueous/flexible ZABs present superior performances with peak power densities of 156 and 85&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, superior to Pt/C&#8208;based counterparts (128 and 73&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2). This research provides a pivotal foundation for the evolution of bifunctional catalysts in the energy sector.

Chiral propeller&#8211;shaped triaryl framework of a binaphthyl&#8208;based amino&#8208;borane catalyst induces facial selectivity in the hydride transfer to prochiral iminiums in asymmetric hydrogenation of enamines.







Abstract
Utilization of chiral frustrated Lewis pairs as catalysts in enantioselective hydrogenation of unsaturated molecules represents a promising approach in asymmetric synthesis. In our effort to improve our current understanding of the factors governing the stereoselectivity in these catalytic processes, herein we examined the mechanism of direct hydrogenation of aromatic enamines catalyzed by a binaphthyl&#8211;based chiral amino&#8211;borane. Our computational analysis reveals that only one particular conformer of the key borohydride reaction intermediate can be regarded as a reactive form of this species. This borohydride conformer has a well&#8211;defined chiral propeller shape, which induces facial selectivity in the hydride transfer to pro&#8211;chiral iminium intermediates. The propeller chirality of the reactive borohydride conformer is generated by the axially chiral binaphthyl scaffold of the amino&#8211;borane catalyst through stabilizing &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions. This new computational insight can be readily used to interpret the high degree of stereoinduction observed for these reactions. We expect that the concept of chirality relay could be further exploited in catalyst design endeavors.

         <title>Continuous Synthesis of a Macrocyclic Sulfite of Polyethylene Glycol by Cascaded Continuous Stirred Tank Reactors (CSTRs)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insert text for Table of Contents here: We proposed a novel continuous process for the synthesis of macrocyclic polyethylene glycol sulfite (PEG&#8208;MCSi), which is a versatile building block for many PEG derivatives. In contrast to batch reactions, continuous production for this intermediate proves to be stable in terms of yield over a long course, and is therefore suitable for bulk production of PEG&#8208;MCSi.







Abstract
Many macrocyclic compounds are attractive drug&#8208;like molecules or intermediates due to their special properties. However, the bulk synthesis of such compounds are hindered by the necessity of using diluted solutions, in order to prevent intermolecular reactions that yields oligomer impurities, thereby resulting in a low production efficiency. Such challenge can be adequately addressed by using continuous reactors, allowing improved efficiency with smaller space footprints. In this work, we proposed a novel continuous process for the synthesis of a macrocyclic sulfite of tetraethylene glycol (PEG4&#8208;MCSi), which is a precursor to a very useful building block, PEG4&#8208;macrocyclic sulfate (PEG4&#8208;MCS). The basic reaction parameters, including stoichiometry and temperature, were first confirmed with small batch reactions, and the effectiveness of coiled reactors and continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTRs) were compared. Cascaded CSTRs were proven to be suitable, and the reaction parameters were subject to further optimization to give a robust continuous process. The process was then tested with 4&#8197;parallel runs for up to 64&#8197;h. Finally, the merits and demerits of batch and continuous reactions were also compared, demonstrating the suitability of latter in the bulk production of macrocyclic PEG&#8208;MCSi compounds.

         <title>A Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Annulation Strategy to Linearly Fused Functionalized N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

We report a stereoselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed annulation strategy to linearly fused polycyclic piperidines from readily available substrates. These products can be chemoselectively functionalized to generate analogs that represent common substructures in bioactive compounds.







Abstract
Linearly fused polycyclic piperidines represent common substructures in natural products and biologically active small molecules. We have devised a Pd&#8208;catalyzed annulation strategy to these compounds that converts readily available 2&#8208;tetralones and indanones into these scaffolds with the potential for control of both enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. Importantly, these compounds can be chemoselectively functionalized, providing an efficient and robust methodology to these important nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules.

         <title>Molecular Dynamics of Steroidal Rotors Probed by Theoretical, Spectroscopic and Dielectric Methods</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three different steroidal molecular rotors with a dipolar fluorine&#8208;substituted phenyl group rotator were synthesized. Raman and FT&#8208;IR measurements were used to analyse the effect of fluorine substitution on molecular dynamics of the phenyl ring. The electric properties were investigated with the impedance spectroscopy. ECD spectroscopy was used to approximate the solid&#8208;state structure of one of the rotors.







Abstract
Our study focuses on molecular rotors with fast&#8208;moving rotators and their potential applications in the development of new amphidynamic crystals. Steroidal molecular rotors with a dipolar fluorine&#8208;substituted phenyl group as the rotator were synthesized and characterized. Three different rotors were investigated with varying numbers of fluorine atoms. A comprehensive analysis was performed using vibrational spectroscopy (Raman, FT&#8208;IR), electronic circular dichroism (ECD), and dielectric response to understand the behavior of the investigated model rotors. The results were supported by theoretical calculations using Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods. The angle&#8208;dependent polarized Raman spectra confirmed the crystallinity of the samples. Nearly frequency and temperature&#8208;independent permittivity suggest low&#8208;frequency librational motion of stators. An in&#8208;depth analysis of ECD spectra revealed high conformational flexibility in solution, resulting in low ECD effects, while in the solid&#8208;state with restricted rotation, significant ECD effects were observed. These findings shed light on the conformational behavior and potential applications of the studied steroidal molecular rotors.

         <title>Artificial Processive Catalytic Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A processive catalyst undergoes several rounds of catalysis before it is released from the substrate. The drawing shows possible ways (A&#8211;D) in which a synthetic catalyst can interact with the substrate to achieve processivity.







Abstract
Processive catalysts remain attached to a substrate and perform multiple rounds of catalysis. They are abundant in nature. This review highlights artificial processive catalytic systems, which can be divided into (A) catalytic rings that move along a polymer chain, (B) catalytic pores that hold polymer chains and decompose them, (C) catalysts that remain attached to and move around a cyclic substrate via supramolecular interactions, and (D) anchored catalysts that remain in contact with a substrate via multiple catalytic interactions (see frontispiece).

         <title>Insulating 6,6&#8208;Phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric Acid Methyl Ester on Transition&#8208;Metal Dichalcogenides: Impact of the Hybrid Materials on the Optical and Electrical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The PCBM was insulated onto the surfaces of ten transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) through covalent functionalization. Comprehensive studies were conducted on their optical and electronic properties, including photoluminescence, conductivity, and photo&#8208;response. PCBM customized the properties of each TMDs, classifying them into three groups based on alignment: type I, type II, and metallic.







Abstract
In this study we develop a strategy to insulate 6,6 &#8208;Phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) on the basal plane of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Concretely single layers of MoS2, MoSe2, MoTe2, WS2, WSe2 and WTe2 and ultrathin MoO2 and WO2 were grown via chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Then, the thiol group of a PCBM modified with cysteine reacts with the chalcogen vacancies on the basal plane of TMDs, yielding PCBM&#8208;MoS2, PCBM&#8208;MoSe2, PCBM&#8208;WS2, PCBM&#8208;WSe2, PCBM&#8208;WTe2, PCBM&#8208;MoO2 and PCBM&#8208;WO2. Afterwards, all the hybrid materials were characterized using several techniques, including XPS, Raman spectroscopy, TEM, AFM, and cyclic voltammetry. Furthermore, PCBM causes a unique optical and electrical impact in every TMDs. For MoS2 devices, the conductivity and photoluminescence (PL) emission achieve a remarkable enhancement of 1700&#8201;% and 200&#8201;% in PCBM&#8208;MoS2 hybrids. Similarly, PCBM&#8208;MoTe2 hybrids exhibit a 2&#8208;fold enhancement in PL emission at 1.1&#8197;eV. On the other hand, PCBM&#8208;MoSe2, PCBM&#8208;WSe2 and PCBM&#8208;WS2 hybrids exhibited a new interlayer exciton at 1.29&#8211;1.44, 1.7 and 1.37&#8208;154&#8197;eV along with an enhancement of the photo&#8208;response by 2400, 3200 and 600&#8201;%, respectively. Additionally, PCBM&#8208;WTe2 and PCBM&#8208;WO2 showed a modest photo&#8208;response, in sharp contrast with pristine WTe2 or WO2 which archive pure metallic character.

         <title>Dansylated Nitrile N&#8208;Oxide as the Fluorescent Dye Clickable to Unsaturated Bonds without Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent polymeric materials have been exploited in the various research fields. However, the covalent immobilization of fluorescent dye onto common polymers is not the practical preparation technique. Herein, we report the design, synthesis, click reaction, and optical properties of dansylated nitrile N&#8208;oxide (Dansyl&#8208;NO). The results indicate that Dansyl&#8208;NO serves as a fluorescent dye clickable to alkenes and alkynes.







Abstract
Fluorescent polymeric materials have been exploited in the fields of aesthetical purposes, biomedical engineering, and three&#8208;dimensional printing applications. While the fluorescent materials are prepared by the polymerization of fluorescent monomer or the blending a fluorescent dye with common polymer, the covalent immobilization of fluorescent dye onto common polymers is not the practical technique. In this paper, dansylated nitrile N&#8208;oxide (Dansyl&#8208;NO) has been designed and synthesized to be a stable nitrile N&#8208;oxide as the derivative of 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;naphthaldehyde. While Dansyl&#8208;NO shows good reactivity to an alkene and an alkyne to give fluorescent Dansyl&#8208;Ene and Dansyl&#8208;Yne, respectively, it hardly reacts to a nitrile. The results indicate that Dansyl&#8208;NO serves as a fluorescent dye clickable to alkenes and alkynes. To know the effects of solvent on the fluorescent properties, the UV&#8208;vis and fluorescence spectra of Dansyl&#8208;Ene are measured in three solvents. Dansyl&#8208;Ene shows fluorescent solvatochromism, which appears to be red&#8208;shifted along with the increase in solvent polarity. Poly(styrene&#8208;co&#8208;butadiene) directly reacts with Dansyl&#8208;NO to give fluorescent modified SB. The emission spectrum of modified SB is blue&#8208;shifted compared with that of Dansyl&#8208;Ene. The blue&#8208;shift could be possibly attributed to the presence of less polar polymer skeleton around the dansyl moieties of modified SB.

The blue-shift could be possibly attributed to the presence of less polar polymer skeleton around the dansyl moieties of &lt;b&gt;modified SB&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Gold&#8208;catalyzed endo&#8208;selective Ring&#8208;opening of Epoxides and its Application in Construction of Poly&#8208;ethers</title>

         <dc:description>
Graphical Abstract. An efficient, gold&#8208;catalyzed 6&#8208;endo selective ring&#8208;opening of epoxides to prepare 3&#8208;hydoxyl tetrahydropyran motifs is reported. This method also allows to construct the subunits of marine ladder&#8208;like poly&#8208;ethers (MLP), emulating the Nakanishi's hypothesis in biosynthesizing MLP toxins. In addition, tricyclic core of macrolide natural products lituarines A&#8722;C is synthesized over 8 steps from known started material.







Abstract
Tetrahydropyran and tetrahydropyran&#8208;fused poly&#8208;ethers scaffolds are found in many classes of natural products and medicinally relevant small molecules. Here we describe a catalytic system for 6&#8208;endo selective ring&#8208;opening of epoxides by Au(I) or Au(III) catalyst that provides rapid access to various tetrahydropyran&#8208;derived motifs. It also could efficiently construct the subunits of marine ladder&#8208;like poly&#8208;ethers through emulating the Nakanishi's hypothesis on the biosynthesis of these toxins. The synthetic utility of this method is also demonstrated in the preparation of the tricyclic core of tetrahydropyran&#8208;containing macrolide natural products lituarines A&#8722;C.

         <title>Carboranylphosphines: B9&#8208;Substituted Derivatives with Enhanced Reactivity for Anchoring to Dendrimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Specifically functionalized carboranes (bearing NH2 and OH groups) were synthesized to be grafted onto dendrimers, but steric hindrance prevents full substitution even of the hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene core, as illustrated by birds crowned by a carborane competing for access to food. The beaks are red (oxygen atoms), signifying the strongly nucleophilic OH. The feet are dark red (phosphorus atoms), which they could potentially use to complex a few metals after they have finished eating. More information can be found in the Research Article by A.&#8208;M. Caminade, E. Hey&#8208;Hawkins and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303867). Artwork by Dr. Chistoph Selg.

         <title>When is an Imine Directing Group a Transient Imine Directing Group in C&#8211;H Functionalization?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#8216;Transient&#8217; C&#8211;H functionalization has emerged in recent years to describe the use of a dynamic linkage, often an imine, to direct cyclometalation and subsequent functionalization. As the field continues to grow in popularity, we consider the features that make an imine directing group transient.&#160;A transient imine should be i) formed dynamically&#160;in situ, ii) avoid discrete introduction or cleavage steps, and iii) offer the potential for catalysis in both the directing group and metal.&#160;&#160;This concept article contrasts transient imines with pioneering early studies of imines as directing groups for the formation of metallacycles and the use of preformed imines in C&#8211;H functionalization. Leading developments in the use of catalytic additives to form transient directing groups (as aldehyde or amine) are covered including selected highlights of the most recent examples of catalytic imine directed C&#8211;H functionalization with transition metals.</dc:description>

         <title>Co(II) Substitution Enhances the Esterase Activity of a de Novo Designed Zn(II) Carbonic Anhydrase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbonic Anhydrases (CAs) are targets for de&#160;Novo protein designers due to the simplicity of the active site and rapid rate of the reaction. The first reported mimic contained a Zn(II) bound to three histidine imidazole nitrogens and an exogenous water molecule, closely mimicking the native enzymes&#8217; first coordination sphere. Co(II) has served as an alternative metal to interrogate CAs due to its d7 electronic configuration for more detailed solution characterization. We present here the Co(II) substituted [Co(II)(H2O/OH&#8722;)]N(TRIL2WL23H)3n+ that behaves similarly to native Co(II) substituted human&#8208;CAs. Like the Zn(II) analogue, the cobalt&#8208;derivative at slightly basic pH is incapable of hydrolyzing p&#8209;nitrophenylacetate (pNPA); however, as the pH is increased a significant activity develops, which at pH values above 10 eventually yields a catalytic efficiency that exceeds that of the [Zn(II)(OH&#8722;)]N(TRIL2WL23H)3+. X&#8208;ray absorption analysis is consistent with an octahedral species at pH 7.5 that converts to a 5&#8208;coordinate species by pH 11. UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy monitors this transition, giving a pKa value of 10.3. We assign this conversion to the formation of a 5&#8208;coordinate Co(II)(Nimid)3(OH)(H2O) species. The pH dependent kinetic analysis indicates the maximal rate (kcat) and catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km), follow the same pH profile as the spectroscopic conversion to the pentacoordinate species.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Liquid Crystallinity and Electroluminescence via Sulfonation of S&#8208;Annulated Perylene Tetraester</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study presents a comparative analysis of S&#8208;annulated perylene tetraester (PTE&#8208;S) and its sulfone (PTE&#8208;SO2) analogue. This sulfone modification reduced melting point and stabilized a room temperature columnar rectangular (Colr) phase in contrast to its parent PTE&#8208;S which showed a crystalline behaviour at room temperature. This molecular design also leads to red&#8208;shifted absorbance and emission in comparison to PTE&#8208;S, along with a tuning of photoluminescence from sky blue to green, achieving an impressive quantum yield of 85%. OLED devices fabricated using PTE&#8208;SO2 as emitter material at concentrations of 0.2, 0.5, and 1 wt.% in CBP as host material. A maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 2.9% was observed with the 0.5 wt.% PTE&#8208;SO2 in CBP with CIE coordinates of (0.45, 0.35), accompanied by an orange luminance of 848 cd/m2. Notably, a device with a 0.5 wt% doping concentration of PTE&#8208;S demonstrates an EQE of 3.5%, and cyan luminance of 2,598 cd/m2.</dc:description>

A maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 2.9% was observed with the 0.5 wt.% PTE-SO2 in CBP with CIE coordinates of (0.45, 0.35), accompanied by an orange luminance of 848 cd/m2. Notably, a device with a 0.5 wt% doping concentration of PTE-S demonstrates an EQE of 3.5%, and cyan luminance of 2,598 cd/m2.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Resorcinarene Hexameric Capsule as a Supramolecular Photoacid to Trigger Olefin Hydroarylation in Confined Space</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The self&#8208;assembled resorcinarene capsule C6 shows remarkable photoacidity upon light irradiation, which is here exploited to catalyze olefin hydroarylation reactions in confined space. An experimental pKa* value range of &#8208;3.3 &#8208; &#8208;2.8 was estimated for the photo&#8208;excited hexameric capsule C6*, and consequently an increase in acidity of 8.8 log units was observed with respect to its ground state (pKa = 5.5&#8208;6.0). This makes the hexameric capsule the first example of a self&#8208;assembled supramolecular photoacid. The photoacid C6* can catalyze hydroarylation reaction of olefins with aromatic substrates inside its cavity, while no reaction occurred between them in the absence of irradiation and/or capsule. DFT calculations corroborated a mechanism in which the photoacidity of C6* plays a crucial role in the protonation step of the aromatic substrate. A further proton transfer to olefin with a concomitant C&#8208;C bond formation and a final deprotonation step lead to product releasing.</dc:description>

         <title>QM/MM Study Into the Mechanism of Oxidative C=C Double Bond Cleavage by Lignostilbene&#8208;a,b&#8208;Dioxygenase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enzymatic biosynthesis of fragrance molecules from lignin fragments is an important reaction in biotechnology for the sustainable production of fine chemicals. In this work we investigated the biosynthesis of vanillin from lignostilbene by a nonheme iron dioxygenase using QM/MM and tested several suggested proposals via either an epoxide or dioxetane intermediate. Binding of dioxygen to iron(II) gives fast electron transfer from substrate to oxidant to generate an iron(II)&#8208;superoxo species with lignostilbene cation radical. The dioxygenase mechanism starts with electrophilic attack of the terminal oxygen atom of the superoxo group on the central C=C bond of lignostilbene, whereby the second&#8208;coordination sphere effects in the substrate binding pocket that led to preferential dioxetane formation. The work is rationalized with thermochemical cycles and valence bond schemes that explain the electron transfer processes during the reaction mechanism. Particularly, the polarity of the protein and the local electric field and dipole moments enable a facile electron transfer and an exergonic dioxetane formation pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Magnetic&#8211;Plasmonic Nanocomposites as Versatile Substrates for Surface&#8211;enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores magnetic&#8211;plasmonic nanocomposites for SERS, focusing on their design, fabrication, and surface functionalization. It highlights their potential in applications like medical diagnostics and environmental monitoring and anticipates significant future contributions to scientific and technological advancements in these fields.







Abstract
Surface&#8211;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy, a highly sensitive technique for detecting trace&#8211;level analytes, relies on plasmonic substrates. The choice of substrate, its morphology, and the excitation wavelength are crucial in SERS applications. To address advanced SERS requirements, the design and use of efficient nanocomposite substrates have become increasingly important. Notably, magnetic&#8211;plasmonic (MP) nanocomposites, which combine magnetic and plasmonic properties within a single particle system, stand out as promising nanoarchitectures with versatile applications in nanomedicine and SERS spectroscopy. In this review, we present an overview of MP nanocomposite fabrication methods, explore surface functionalization strategies, and evaluate their use in SERS. Our focus is on how different nanocomposite designs, magnetic and plasmonic properties, and surface modifications can significantly influence their SERS&#8208;related characteristics, thereby affecting their performance in specific applications such as separation, environmental monitoring, and biological applications. Reviewing recent studies highlights the multifaceted nature of these materials, which have great potential to transform SERS applications across a range of fields, from medical diagnostics to environmental monitoring. Finally, we discuss the prospects of MP nanocomposites, anticipating favorable developments that will make substantial contributions to various scientific and technological areas.

         <title>Divergent Electrochemical Synthesis of Indoles through pKa Regulation of Amides: Synthetic and Mechanistic Insights</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This manuscript describes an unprecedented chemo&#8208;divergent synthesis of C&#8208;3&#8208;free and C&#8208;3&#8208;selenylated indoles with exclusive chemoselectivity through controlled and selective electrochemical oxidation of 2&#8208;amino stilbene derivatives. The chemoselectivity was achieved by regulating the pKa of the N&#8722;H proton. Detailed experimental and computational studies assist in explaining the ambiguous chemical nature of diversely N&#8208;protected 2&#8208;amino stilbenes in synthesizing chemo&#8208;divergent indole frameworks.







Abstract
A divergent synthetic approach to access highly substituted indole scaffolds is illustrated. By virtue of a tunable electrochemical strategy, distinct control over the C&#8208;3 substitution pattern was achieved by employing two analogous 2&#8208;styrylaniline precursors. The chemoselectivity is governed by the fine&#8208;tuning of the acidity of the amide proton, relying on the appropriate selection of N&#8208;protecting groups, and assisted by the reactivity of the electrogenerated intermediates. Detailed mechanistic investigations based on cyclic voltametric experiments and computational studies revealed the crucial role of water additive, which assists the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer event for highly acidic amide precursors, followed by an energetically favorable intramolecular C&#8722;N coupling, causing exclusive fabrication of the C&#8208;3 unsubstituted indoles. Alternatively, the implementation of an electrogenerated cationic olefin activator delivers the C&#8208;3 substituted indoles through the preferential nucleophilic nature of the N&#8208;acyl amides. This electrochemical approach of judicious selection of N&#8208;protecting groups to regulate pKa/E&#176; provides an expansion in the domain of switchable generation of heterocyclic derivatives in a sustainable fashion, with high regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity.

         <title>Versatile Palladium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular cyclization to access new luminescent azaphosphaphenalene motifs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein a swift and versatile palladium cyclization is presented using readily accessible catalysts and starting materials to produce new azaphosphaphenalene motifs. The luminescent properties of these products were evaluated and some of the key compounds had their structure unambiguously confirmed by X&#8208;ray analysis. The phosphorus atom offers interesting possibilities for post functionalization.







Abstract
Using a straightforward sequence of diphosphonylation and a Pd&#8208;catalysed concerted&#8208;metalation&#8208;deprotonation (CMD), a synthetic strategy towards polyaromatic phosphorus containing heterocycles was developed. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of new azaphosphaphenalenes, using easily accessible palladium catalysts and starting materials. The key tetrahydroquinoline intermediates of the reaction were synthesised via a fast and effective procedure and could be isolated as such, or further reacted towards the target polyaromatic structures. The obtained products showed interesting luminescent properties and their emission, excitation and quantum yields were evaluated.

&lt;p&gt;Herein a swift and versatile palladium cyclization is presented using readily accessible catalysts and starting materials to produce new azaphosphaphenalene motifs. The luminescent properties of these products were evaluated and some of the key compounds had their structure unambiguously confirmed by X-ray analysis. The phosphorus atom offers interesting possibilities for post functionalization.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a straightforward sequence of diphosphonylation and a Pd-catalysed concerted-metalation-deprotonation (CMD), a synthetic strategy towards polyaromatic phosphorus containing heterocycles was developed. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of new azaphosphaphenalenes, using easily accessible palladium catalysts and starting materials. The key tetrahydroquinoline intermediates of the reaction were synthesised via a fast and effective procedure and could be isolated as such, or further reacted towards the target polyaromatic structures. The obtained products showed interesting luminescent properties and their emission, excitation and quantum yields were evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Generalist versus Specialist Self&#8208;Replicators</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Whether assembly&#8208;driven self&#8208;replicators that emerge from a mixture of two building blocks specialize on one resource or are generalists was found to depend on their supramolecular organization.







Abstract
Darwinian evolution, including the selection of the fittest species under given environmental conditions, is a major milestone in the development of synthetic living systems. In this regard, generalist or specialist behavior (the ability to replicate in a broader or narrower, more specific food environment) are of importance. Here we demonstrate generalist and specialist behavior in dynamic combinatorial libraries composed of a peptide&#8208;based and an oligo(ethylene glycol) based building block. Three different sets of macrocyclic replicators could be distinguished based on their supramolecular organization: two prepared from a single building block as well as one prepared from an equimolar mixture of them. Peptide&#8208;containing hexamer replicators were found to be generalists, i.&#8201;e. they could replicate in a broad range of food niches, whereas the octamer peptide&#8208;based replicator and hexameric ethyleneoxide&#8208;based replicator were proven to be specialists, i.&#8201;e. they only replicate in very specific food niches that correspond to their composition. However, sequence specificity cannot be demonstrated for either of the generalist replicators. The generalist versus specialist nature of these replicators was linked to their supramolecular organization. Assembly modes that accommodate structurally different building blocks lead to generalist replicators, while assembly modes that are more restrictive yield specialist replicators.

         <title>Strong Circularly Polarized Luminescence Promoted by AIE&#8208;active Chiral Co&#8208;assemblies in Liquid Crystal Polymer Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kind of chiral co&#8208;assembled liquid crystal polymer (PTZ doped in S&#8208;PB2) exhibits reversed and amplified yellow CPL emission (|glum|=0.13) after thermal annealing treatment. This is due to the variation of chiral co&#8208;assemblies from spherical aggregates to helical nanofibers. Noticeably, the largest glum value could reach up to +0.91/&#8208;0.82 by increasing the film thickness.







Abstract
Recently, extensive works have focused on increasing the dissymmetry factors (glum) of various circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials, which is one of the most important factors for future applications of CPL. Herein, we designed a chiral co&#8208;assembled liquid crystal polymer (LCP) PTZ@R/S&#8208;PB2, which was prepared by chiral binary co&#8208;polymer (R/S&#8208;PB2) doped with achiral phenothiazine derivation dye (PTZ). For comparison, ternary co&#8208;polymerized LCP (R/S&#8208;PT) was synthesized by co&#8208;polymerizing with mesogenic monomer, chiral monomer and emissive monomer. Both PTZ@R/S&#8208;PB2 and R/S&#8208;PT showed aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties. Interestingly, the CPL signals of both PTZ@R/S&#8208;PB2 and R/S&#8208;PT were reversed and amplified after thermal annealing treatment. The |glum| values of the co&#8208;assembled PTZ@R/S&#8208;PB2 were up to 0.13 at a 32&#8197;nm thickness, which was 5.4 times that of R/S&#8208;PT (|glum|=0.024). This is due to PTZ@R/S&#8208;PB2 could form more orderly chiral co&#8208;assembly structures. Noticeably, increasing the LCP film thickness could further improve the glum value, and the maximum glum of PTZ@R/S&#8208;PB2 could be enhanced to +0.91/&#8722;0.82 at a 220&#8197;nm thickness.

         <title>Application of quasi solid electrolytes in organic based electrochromic devices: A mini review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of quasi&#8208;solid electrolytes for the construction of electrochromic devices (ECDs) is attractive because of their ease of preparation, availability, low cost, improve electrochromic performance, good ionic conductivity and prevention of leakages in ECDs. Hence, It is important to understand the current state of developing quasi&#8208;solid electrolytes and ways of improving their efficiencies.







Abstract
The interest in all solid organic based electrochromic devices (ECDs) is on the increase. This is because these devices offer the applicability of electrochromic materials in products such as smart sensors, smart windows, flexible wearables and energy storage devices. The use of quasi&#8208;solid electrolytes for the construction of these ECDs is attractive because of their ease of preparation, availability, low cost, improve electrochromic performance, good ionic conductivity and prevention of leakages in ECDs. Hence, in this review, a detailed discussion is presented on the progress in the development of semi&#8208;solid electrolytes for ECDs fabrication. The preparation of the most common electrolytes that have been applied for organic based ECDs are summarized. Particular attention is given to efforts and strategies that have been adopted to improve the efficiency of quasi&#8208;solid electrolytes. Importantly, knowledge gaps that warrant further research are clearly identified and recommendations for future works are suggested. This review will be very beneficial for both established and new researchers in the field of electrochromic devices and material science.

         <title>Organic Donor&#8208;Acceptor Complexes As Potential Semiconducting Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article overviews the synthesis, characterization, and physico&#8208;chemical properties of the organic donor&#8208;acceptor complexes, often referred to as charge transfer complexes. Donors, categorized as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, nitrogen heterocycles, and sulphur&#8208;containing aromatic compounds, are examined in their reactions with various acceptors like TCNQ, TCNE, fullerenes, and others. The article delves into applications of resulting complexes for physico&#8208;electronic purposes and includes theoretical investigations to rationalize the observed properties.







Abstract
In this review article, the synthesis, characterization and physico&#8208;chemical properties of the organic donor&#8208;acceptor complexes are highlighted and a special emphasis has been placed on developing them as semiconducting materials. The electron&#8208;rich molecules, i.&#8201;e., donors have been broadly grouped in three categories, namely polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, nitrogen heterocycles and sulphur containing aromatic donors. The reactions of these classes of the donors with the acceptors, namely tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ), tetracyanoethylene (TCNE), tetracyanobenzene (TCNB), benzoquinone, pyromellitic dianhydride and pyromellitic diimides, fullerenes, phenazine, benzothiadiazole, naphthalimide, DMAD, maleic anhydride, viologens and naphthalene diimide are described. The potential applications of the resulting DA complexes for physico&#8208;electronic purposes are also included. The theoretical investigation of many of these products with a view to rationalise their observed physico&#8208;chemical properties is also discussed.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Driven Control Over Triply and Quadruply Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Supramolecular Assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Foldamers consisting of two hydrogen bonding motifs (HBMs) connected by a central azobenzene exhibit concentration and light dependent switching between four states.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymers offer tremendous potential to produce new &#8220;smart&#8221; materials, however, there remains a need to develop systems that are responsive to external stimuli. In this work, visible&#8208;light responsive hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular polymers comprising photoresponsive supramolecular synthons (I&#8211;III) consisting of two hydrogen bonding motifs (HBMs) connected by a central ortho&#8208;tetrafluorinated azobenzene have been characterized by DOSY NMR and viscometry. Comparison of different hydrogen&#8208;bonding motifs reveals that assembly in the low and high concentration regimes is strongly influenced by the strength of association between the HBMs. I, Incorporating a triply hydrogen&#8208;bonded heterodimer, was found to exhibit concentration dependent switching between a monomeric pseudo&#8208;cycle and supramolecular oligomer through intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions between the HBMs. II, Based on the same photoresponsive scaffold, and incorporating a quadruply hydrogen&#8208;bonded homodimer was found to form a supramolecular polymer which was dependent upon the ring&#8208;chain equilibrium and thus dependent upon both concentration and photochemical stimulus. Finally, III, incorporating a quadruply hydrogen&#8208;bonded heterodimer represents the first photoswitchable AB type hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular polymer. Depending on the concentration and photostationary state, four different assemblies dominate for both monomers II and III, demonstrating the ability to control supramolecular assembly and physical properties triggered by light.

         <title>Photoswitching in a Liquid Crystalline Pt(II) Coordination Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An example of single&#8208;component multimode photoswitch was demonstrated by designing a novel Pt(II) coordination complex decorated with spiropyran, which can deliver distinct apparent colors, photoluminescent colors and liquid crystal textures in response to light.







Abstract
Photoswitching of photoluminescence has sparked tremendous research interests for super&#8208;resolution imaging, high&#8208;security&#8208;level anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and other high&#8208;tech applications. However, the excitation of photoluminescence is usually ready to trigger the photoswitching process, making the photoluminescence readout unreliable. Herein, we report a new photoswitch by the marriage of spiropyran with platinum(II) coordination complex. Viable photoluminescence can be achieved upon excitation by 480&#8197;nm visible light while the photoswitching can be easily triggered by 365&#8197;nm UV light. The feasible photoswitching may be benefited from the formed liquid crystalline (LC) phase of the designed photoswitch as a crystalline spiropyran is normally unable to implement photoswitching. Compared to the counterparts, this LC photoswitch can show distinct and reliable apparent colors and emission colors before and after photoswitching, which may promise the utility in high&#8208;security&#8208;level anti&#8208;counterfeiting and other advanced information technologies.

         <title>Aurones: Unexplored Visible&#8208;Light Photoswitches for Aqueous Medium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aurone derivatives have been introduced for the first time as a novel class of visible&#8208;light photoswitches in aqueous medium possessing good quantum yields, high conversions in photostationary states and remarkably long (up to 7 years) lifetimes of the photoisomers. Moreover, the aurone scaffold can be easily modified with functional substituents without affecting its robust photochemical performance paving a way towards a range of applications.







Abstract
The development of synthetically accessible photoswitches showing an efficient performance in aqueous medium has recently become an urgent task due to the rapid progress of photopharmacology and novel biomedical applications. In response to this challenge, in this work, aurone derivatives are introduced as a novel class of efficient visible&#8208;light photoswitches for aqueous medium. In general, aurones exhibit superior performance in water, including significantly higher quantum yields, compared with other indigoid photoswitches (hemithioindigo and hemiindigo). Especially remarkable are the half&#8208;lives of the photoinduced E&#8208;isomers of aurones in water, reaching up to 7&#8197;years. Further modification of the aurone scaffold with substituents that increase water solubility does not affect most of the photoswitching characteristics and even improves some them. The highly advantageous property profile of the aurone photoswitches make them a perfect novel platform for the design of light&#8208;controllable systems in the areas requiring photoswitching in aqueous medium.

         <title>Covalent Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification of Metal&#8208;Organic Cages: Concepts and Recent Progress</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) is a powerful research paradigm capable of constructing metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) with customized structures and properties. A variety of efficient organic reactions have been developed for the functionalization of MOCs, and these new products have shown potential applications in multiple fields.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) are supramolecular coordination complexes that have internal cavities for hosting guest molecules and exhibiting various properties. However, the functions of MOCs are limited by the choice of the building blocks. Post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) is a technique that can introduce new functional groups and replace existing ones on the MOCs without changing their geometry. Among many PSM methods, covalent PSM is a promising approach to modify MOCs with tailored structures and functions. Covalent PSM can be applied to either the internal cavity or the external surface of the MOCs, depending on the functionality expected to be customized. However, there are still some challenges and limitations in the field of covalent PSM of MOCs, such as the balance between the stability of MOCs and the harshness of organic reactions involved in covalent PSMs. This concept article introduces the organic reaction types involved in covalent PSM of MOCs, their new applications after modification, and summarizes and provides an outlook of this research field.

         <title>Synthesis and functionalities of FeSn12 superatom prepared by single atom introduction with a dendrimer template</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Development of synthesis method for superatoms is significant for the design to mimic an atom. The asymmetric dendrimer &#8220;pyTPM G4&#8221; introduces one Fe atom, making solution&#8208;phase synthesis of FeSn12. The synthesis and obtained structure were clarified and the electronic state was investigated by theoretical calculations. The prepared superatom showed Near&#8208;IR emission and magnetism enhancement.







Abstract
Superatoms are promising as new building block materials that can be designed by precise controlling of the constituent atoms. Stannaspherene (Sn122&#8722;) is a rigid cage&#8208;like cluster with icosahedral symmetry, for which one&#8208;atom encapsulation was theoretically expected and detected in the gas phase. Here, a single&#8208;atom introduction method into stannaspherene using a dendrimer template with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) protection is demonstrated. This advanced solution&#8208;phase synthesis allows not only the selective doping of one atom into the cluster cage, but also enable further detail characterization of optical and magnetic properties that were not possible in the gas&#8208;phase synthesis. In other words, this liquid&#8208;phase synthesis method has enabled the adaptation of detailed analytical methods. In this study, FeSn12 was synthesized and characterized, revealing that a single Fe atom introduction in the Sn122&#8722; cage result in the appearance of near&#8208;infrared emission and enhancement in the magnetism.

         <title>Versatile Polymerization&#8208;Induced Emission Polymers from Barbier Polymerization of Cinnamic Esters with Tunable Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cinnamic ester was successfully used as monomer to prepare polymers with NTIL characteristics through Barbier PIE strategy, which exhibited adjustable NTIL from AIE type to ACQ type. Further potential applications and the mechanism of luminescent polymer in explosive detection were carried out.







Abstract
Cinnamic ester is a common and abundant chemical substance, which can be extracted from natural plants. Compared with traditional esters, cinnamic ester contains &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl structure with multiple reactive sites, resulting in more abundant reactivities and chemical structures. Here, a versatile polymerization&#8208;induced emission (PIE) is successfully demonstrated through Barbier polymerization of cinnamic ester. Attributed to its abundant reactivities of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl structure, Barbier polymerization of cinnamic esters with different organodihalides gives polyalcohol and polyketone via 1,2&#8208;addition and 1,4&#8208;addition, respectively, which is also confirmed by small molecular model reactions. Meanwhile, these organodihalides dependant polyalcohol and polyketone exhibit different non&#8208;traditional intrinsic luminescence (NTIL) from aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) type to aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) type, where novel PIE luminogens (PIEgens) are revealed. Further potential applications in explosive detection are carried out, where it achieves TNT detection sensitivity at&#8197;ppm level in solution and ng level on the test paper. This work therefore expands the structure and functionality libraries of monomer, polymer and NTIL, which might cause inspirations to different fields including polymer chemistry, NTIL, AIE and PIE.

         <title>&#8220;The Sulfur Dance&#8221; Around Arenes and Heteroarenes &#8208; the Reversible Nature of Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The features of a category of reversible nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions in view of their significance and wide scope in aromatic and heteroaromatic chemistry are presented. Exchange of sulfur components surrounding arenes and heteroarenes may occur at 25&#8201;&#176;C, in a process that one may call a &#8220;sulfur dance&#8221;. A dynamic covalent system involving four components illustrates the thermodynamically&#8208;driven formation of a thiacalix[2]arene[2]pyrimidine. This work stimulates the implementation of reversible SNAr reactions in organic, materials and covalent dynamic chemistry.







Abstract
We disclose the features of a category of reversible nucleophilic aromatic substitutions in view of their significance and generality in dynamic aromatic chemistry. Exchange of sulfur components surrounding arenes and heteroarenes may occur at 25&#8201;&#176;C, in a process that one may call a &#8220;sulfur dance&#8221;. These SNAr systems present their own features, apart from common reversible reactions utilized in dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC). By varying conditions, covalent dynamics may operate to provide libraries of thiaarenes with some selectivity, or conversion of a hexa(thio)benzene asterisk into another one. The reversible nature of SNAr is confirmed by three methods: a convergence of the products distribution in reversible SNAr systems, a related product redistribution between two per(thio)benzenes by using a thiolate promoter, and from kinetic/thermodynamic data. A four&#8208;component dynamic covalent system further illustrates the thermodynamically&#8208;driven formation of a thiacalix[2]arene[2]pyrimidine by sulfur component exchanges. This work stimulates the implementation of reversible SNAr in aromatic chemistry and in DCC.

         <title>Polymer Backbone Chemistry Shapes the Alkaline Stability of Metallopolymer Anion&#8208;Exchange Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metallopolymers employ a metal center to facilitate the transport of ions in anion&#8208;exchange membranes. The characteristics of metallopolymers emerge from the intricate interplay between the metal complex and polymer backbone. Our investigation scrutinizes the influence of polymer backbone chemistry on the metalation reaction and the alkaline resilience of metallopolymers.







Abstract
Anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells and water electrolyzers have garnered significant attention in past years due to their potential role in sustainable and affordable energy conversion and storage. However, the chemical stability of the polymeric anion&#8208;exchange membranes (AEMs), the key component in these devices, currently limits their lifespan. Recently, metallopolymers have been proposed as chemically stable alternatives to organic cations, using metal centers as ion transporters. In metallopolymer AEMs, various properties such as alkaline stability, water uptake, flexibility, and performance, are determined by both the metal complex and polymer backbone. Herein we present a systematic study investigating the influence of the polymer backbone chemistry on some of these properties, focusing on the alkaline stability of low&#8208;oxophilicity gold metallopolymers. Despite the use of a common N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand, upon gold metalation using the same reaction conditions, different polymer backbones end up forming different gold complexes. These findings suggest that polymer chemistry affects the metalation reaction in addition to the other properties relevant to AEM performance.

         <title>Luminescent Supramolecular Ionic Frameworks based on Organic Fluorescent Polycations and Polyanionic Phosphorescent Metal Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Emissive ionic frameworks are designed by associating blue emissive tetraphenylethylene moieties functionalized with four imidazolium heads and red&#8208;NIR phosphorescent dianionic Mo or tetracationic Re&#8208;based octahedral clusters. Resulting hybrids show a porous structure in their crystalline state and their chemical and thermal stability depends on the charge of the metal cluster. Emission in the red&#8208;NIR by 1PA and 2PA were evidenced in both cases.







Abstract
Emissive ionic supramolecular frameworks are designed by associating tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based tetra&#8208;cationic units and di&#8208;anionic molybdenum or tetra&#8208;anionic rhenium octahedral clusters. Obtained structures were characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The emission properties of the hybrids were investigated as dry powders or in various solvents by one photon and two photon absorption leading to a O2 concentration dependent luminescence color for the Mo based hybrid.

         <title>Functionalized Polyamine Synthesis with Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although polyamines are pivotal in various biological processes, the difficulties in accessing structurally modified polyamines have limited their exploration for discovering bioactive compounds. The cover feature picture shows how catalysts (left) are irradiated by light. Rapid photoredox&#8208;catalyzed functionalization of target polyamines (right) allows the attachment of various substituents to develop novel bioactive molecules and diverse molecular probes to advance chemical biology studies. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. Murakami and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202304374).

         <title>Controlled Ring Opening of a Tetracyclic Tetraphosphane with Twofold Metallocene Bridging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A direct route to a doubly ferrocene bridged tetracyclic tetraphosphane 1 was developed via reductive coupling of Fe(CpPCl2)2 (2a), where a chlorine terminated linear P4&#8208;compound 3 could be identified as an intermediate. Selective P&#8208;P bond activation was further achieved by reacting 1 with elemental selenium or [Cp*Al]4, where regioselective insertion of Se or Al atoms resulted in ferrocenylene bridged [P4Se] (4) or [P4Al] (7) moieties. Compound 7 can be transformed to a hydrogen terminated linear P4 species, 8, with protic solvents. Methylation of compound 1 with MeOTf, proceeds via intermediate formation of monomethylated species 5, which gradually produced Me2&#8208;terminated dicationic 6, again containing a linear P4&#8208;unit. Besides spectroscopic characterization, the structural details of compounds 1, 4, 6, and 8 could be determined by SC&#8208;XRD. Moreover, DFT calculations were used to rationalize the reactivity of 1, derived compounds and intermediates. As a key feature, 1 undergoes ring opening polymerization to a linear polyphosphane 9.</dc:description>

         <title>Cationic Hypervalent Chalcogen Bond Catalysis on the Povarov Reaction: Reactivity and Stereoselectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chalcogen bond catalysis, particularly cationic hypervalent chalcogen bond catalysis, is considered to be an effective strategy for organocatalysis. In this work, the cationic hypervalent chalcogen bond catalysis for the Povarov reaction between N&#8208;benzylideneaniline and ethyl vinyl ether was investigated by density functional theory (DFT). The catalytic reaction involves the cycloaddition process and the proton transfer process, and the rate&#8208;determining step is the cycloaddition process. Cationic hypervalent tellurium derivatives bearing CF3 and F groups exhibit superior catalytic activity. For the rate&#8208;determining step, the Gibbs free energy barrier decreases as the positive electrostatic potential of the chalcogen bond catalysts increases. More importantly, the Gibbs free energy barrier has a strong linear correlation with the electrostatic energy of the chalcogen bond in the catalyst&#8208;substrate complex. Furthermore, the catalytic reactions include the endo pathway and exo pathway. The C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interaction between the substituent of the ethyl vinyl ether and the aryl ring of the N&#8208;benzylideneaniline contributes to the endo&#8208;selectivity of the reaction. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of chalcogen bond catalysis, providing insights for designing chalcogen bond catalysts with high performance.</dc:description>

         <title>C 3&#8208;symmetric luminescent diketone with amido&#8208;linkage as a polymorphic fluorescence emitter</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The study introduces a novel C3&#8208;symmetric b&#8208;diketone compound, BTA&#8208;D3, and its monomeric counterpart, D, with a focus on their synthetic procedure, photophysical properties and aggregation behavior. Both compounds exhibit characteristic absorption and weak fluorescence in solution, with BTA&#8208;D3 displaying higher absorption coefficients due to its larger number of diketone units. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations suggest increased co&#8208;planarity of diketone groups in BTA&#8208;D3. A significant finding is the Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE) property of BTA&#8208;D3, as its fluorescence intensity increases dramatically when exposed to specific solvent ratios. The AIE behavior is attributed to intermolecular excitonic interaction between BTA&#8208;D3 molecules in self&#8208;organized aggregates. We also studied fluorescence anisotropy of BTA&#8208;D3 and D. Despite its larger size, BTA&#8208;D3 showed reduced anisotropy values because of efficient intramolecular energy migration among three diketone units. Furthermore, BTA&#8208;D3 demonstrates unique polymorphism, yielding different emission colors and structures depending on the solvent used. A unique approach is presented for promoting the growth of self&#8208;organized aggregate structures via solvent evaporation, leading to distinct fluorescence properties. This research contributes to the understanding of C3&#8208;symmetric structural molecules and provides insights into strategies for controlling molecular alignment to achieve diverse fluorescence coloration in molecular materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding Chemical Frontiers: Approaches for Generating Diverse and Bioactive Natural Product&#8208;Like Compounds Libraries from Extracts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The realms of natural products and synthetic compounds exhibit distinct chemical spaces that not only differ but also complement each other. While the convergence of these two domains has been explored through hemisynthesis and conventional pharmacomodulation endeavours applied to natural frameworks, a recent and innovative approach has recently emerged that involves the combinatorial generation of libraries of &#8216;natural product&#8208;like compounds&#8217; (NPLCs) through the direct synthetic derivatization of natural extracts. This has led to the production of numerous NPLCs that incorporate structural elements from both their natural (multiple saturated rings, oxygen content, chiral centres) and synthetic (aromatic rings, nitrogen and halogen content, drug&#8208;like properties) precursors. Through careful selection of extracts and reagents, specific bioactivities have been achieved, and this strategy has been deployed in various ways, showing great promise without reaching its full potential to date. This review seeks to provide an overview of reported examples involving the chemical engineering of extracts, showcasing a spectrum of natural product alterations spanning from simple substitutions to complete scaffold remodelling. It also includes an analysis of the accomplishments, perspectives and technical challenges within this field.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic, Oxidative Cleavage of C&#8722;C Bond in Lignin Models and Native Lignin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is challenging to realize the selective C&#8208;C bond cleavage of lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 linkages for production of high&#8208;value aromatic chemicals due to its intrinsic inertness and complex structure. Here we report a light&#8208;driven, chlorine&#8208;radical&#8208;based protocol to realize the oxidative C&#8208;C bond cleavage in various lignin model compounds catalyzed by commercially available TPT and CaCl2, achieving high conversion and good to high product yields at room temperature. Mechanistic studies reveal that the preferential activation of C&#946;&#8208;H bond facilitates the oxidation and C&#8208;C bond cleavage of lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 model via chlorine radical. Furthermore, this method is also applicable to the depolymerization of natural lignin extracts, furnishing the aromatic oxygenates from the cleavage of C&#945;&#8208;C&#946; bonds. This study provides experimental foundations to the depolymerization and valorization of lignin into high value&#8208;added aromatic compounds.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It is challenging to realize the selective C-C bond cleavage of lignin &#946;-O-4 linkages for production of high-value aromatic chemicals due to its intrinsic inertness and complex structure. Here we report a light-driven, chlorine-radical-based protocol to realize the oxidative C-C bond cleavage in various lignin model compounds catalyzed by commercially available TPT and CaCl2, achieving high conversion and good to high product yields at room temperature. Mechanistic studies reveal that the preferential activation of C&#946;-H bond facilitates the oxidation and C-C bond cleavage of lignin &#946;-O-4 model via chlorine radical. Furthermore, this method is also applicable to the depolymerization of natural lignin extracts, furnishing the aromatic oxygenates from the cleavage of C&#945;-C&#946; bonds. This study provides experimental foundations to the depolymerization and valorization of lignin into high value-added aromatic compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dynamics and Coordination of a P2N2 Ligand &#8211; from Twisted Conformation to Chelation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Based on their general spacial flexibility, their Lewis and Br&#248;nsted basicity, and ability to mimic second sphere effects the 1,5&#8208;diaza&#8208;3,7&#8208;diphosphacyclooctane ligand family and their complexes have re&#8208;gained substantial scientific interest. It was now possible to structurally analyze a recently reported member of this family with p&#8208;tolyl and t&#8208;butyl substituents on P and N, respectively, (P2p&#8208;tolN2tBu). Notably, the ligand crystallizes with a &#8216;twisted&#8217; backbone. This compound is the very first of its kind to have been unambiguously characterized with regard to its chemical and molecular structure as being in this conformation. A temperature&#8208;dependent NMR study provides insight into the molecular dynamics of two isomers in solution, which are most likely also both twisted, as judged by the observed limited reactivity. Despite the in principle unfavorable conformation of the free ligand, it was successfully chelated to tungsten and molybdenum centers in mononuclear carbonyl complexes. The ligand, a derivative thereof and four new complexes were comprehensively characterized and analyzed in comparison. This includes single crystal XRD molecular structures of P2p&#8208;tolN2tBu and all four complexes. P2p&#8208;tolN2tBu, regardless of its twisted conformation, is able to coordinate to metal centers given that enough energy (heat) for a conformational change is provided.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Structure of the Small Superelectrophile [C2(OH)2Me2]2+</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The acid&#8208;activation of 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds plays a key role in a variety of electrophilic reactions, some of which are only accessible in superacidic media when a superelectrophilic dication is formed. To obtain structural and electronic information about these elusive species, the vicinal dication [C2(OH)2Me2]2+ is synthesized and characterized by Raman spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction. Since this superelectrophile could not be stabilized in convenient superacids, the usage of liquid SO2 turned out to be crucial. The experimental data are discussed together with quantum&#8208;chemical calculations on the B3LYP/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ level of theory. Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analyses quantify the superelectrophilic interactions found in the solid state.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Formed Electron Inhibitor Enabling Dendrite&#8208;free Garnet Electrolytes: A Case Study of Fumed Silica</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ta&#8208;doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZTO) solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SEs) show great promise for solid&#8208;state batteries due to its high conductivity and safety. However, one of the challenges it faces is lithium dendrite propagation upon long&#8208;term cycling. To address this issue, we propose the incorporation of fumed silica (FS) at the grain boundaries of LLZTO to modify the properties of the garnet pellet, which effectively inhibits the dendrite growth. The introduction of FS has demonstrated several beneficial effects. Firstly, it reduces the migration barrier of lithium ions, which helps prevent dendrite formation and propagation. Additionally, FS reduces the electronic conductivity of the SEs pellet, suppressing the dendrite formation. Moreover, the formed lithium silicates from FS might also be acted as electron inhibitor, thus inhibiting the lithium dendrite growth upon cycling. By investigating the use of FS as a modifier in LLZTO&#8208;based electrolytes, our study contributes to advancing dendrite&#8208;free solid&#8208;state electrolytes and thus the development of high&#8208;performance all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulation of Electronic Structures of the Urchin&#8208;Like NiCoP/CoP Nanocatalysts for Fast Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The exploration of stable, efficient, and low&#8208;cost catalysts toward ammonia borane hydrolysis is of vital significance for the practical implementation of this hydrogen production technology. Integrating interface engineering and nano&#8208;architecture&#160;engineering is a favorable strategy to elevate catalytic performance, as it can modify the electronic structure and provide sufficient active sites simultaneously. In this work, urchin&#8208;like NiCoP/CoP heterostructures&#160;are prepared via a three&#8208;step hydrothermal&#8208;oxidation&#8208;phosphorization synthesis route. It is demonstrated that&#160;the original Ni/Co molar ratio and the amount of phosphorus are crucial for adjusting the morphology, enhancing the exposed surface area, facilitating charge transfer, and modulating the adsorption and activation of H2O molecules.&#160;Consequently, the optimal Ni1Co2P heterostructure displays remarkable catalytic properties in the hydrolysis of ammonia borane with a turnover frequency (TOF) value of 30.3 molH2&#183;min&#8208;1&#183;molmetal&#8208;1, a low apparent activation energy of 25.89&#160;kJ&#183;mol&#8208;1,&#160;and good stability. Furthermore, by combining&#160;infrared spectroscopy&#160;and isotope kinetics experiments, a possible mechanism for the hydrolysis of ammonia borane was proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Aryl&#8208;DABCO Salts as an Unprecedented Sensing Platform for the Detection of Thiols and Selenols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quaternary&#160;N&#8208;aryl&#8208;DABCO salts were introduced for the first time as a highly selective sensing platform for thiols and selenols. By employing this platform, a highly sensitive coumarin based "off&#8208;on" fluorescent probe was designed and synthesized. The probe possesses a good solubility in water, low background fluorescence, and, most importantly, demonstrates high selectivity to aryl thiols and selenols over their aliphatic counterparts and other common nucleophiles. A dramatic increase in fluorescent intensity is achieved through the selective cleavage of the quaternized DABCO&#8208;ring, yielding a piperazine derivatives with a high fluorescent quantum yield (~72%). Moreover, stability of the probe to the most used reducing agents DTT and TCEP was demonstrated. Limits of detection for&#160;p&#8208;thiocresol and phenyl selenide were evaluated to be 22 nM and 6 nM respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Size&#8208;Switchable Ru Nanoaggregates for Enhancing Phototherapy: Hyaluronidase&#8208;Triggered Disassembly to Alleviate Deep Tumor Hypoxia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hypoxia is a critical factor for restricting photodynamic therapy (PDT) of tumor, and it becomes increasingly severe with increasing tissue depth. Thus, the relief of deep tumor hypoxia is extremely important to improve the PDT efficacy. Herein, tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive size&#8208;switchable hyaluronic acid&#8208;hybridized Ru nanoaggregates (HA@Ru NAs) were developed via screening reaction temperature to alleviate deep tumor hypoxia for improving the tumor&#8208;specific PDT by the artful integration multiple bioactivated chemical reactions in situ and receptor&#8208;mediated targeting (RMT). In this nanosystem, Ru NPs not only enabled HA@Ru NAs to have near infrared (NIR)&#8208;mediated photothermal/photodynamic functions, but also could catalyze endogenous H2O2 to produce O2in situ. More importantly, hyaluronidase (HAase) overexpressed in the TME could trigger disassembly of HA@Ru NAs via the hydrolysis of HA, offering the smart size switch capability from 60 to 15 nm for enhancing tumor penetration. Moreover, the RMT characteristics of HA ensured that HA@Ru NAs could specially enter CD44&#8208;overexpressed tumor cells, enhancing tumor&#8208;specific precision of phototherapy. Taken together these distinguishing characteristics, smart HA@Ru NAs successfully realized the relief of deep tumor hypoxia to improve the tumor&#8208;specific PDT.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of defects and charges on the colloidal

stabilization of graphene in water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mastering graphene preparation is an essential step to its integration into practical applications.For large&#8208;scale purposes, full graphite exfoliation appears as a suitable route for grapheneproduction. However, it requires overpowering attractive van der Waals forces demanding largeenergy input, with the risk of introducing defects in the material. This difficulty can beovercome by using graphite intercalation compounds (GIC) as starting material. The greaterinter&#8208;sheet separation in GICs (compared with graphite) allows the gentler exfoliation ofsoluble graphenide (reduced graphene) flakes. A solvent exchange strategy, accompanied bythe oxidation of graphenide to graphene, can be implemented to produce stable aqueousgraphene dispersions (Eau de graphene, EdG), which can be readily incorporated into manyprocesses or materials. In this work, we prove that electrostatic forces are responsible for thestability of fully exfoliated graphene in water, and explore the influence of the oxidation andsolvent exchange procedures on the quality and stability of the EdG. We show that the amountof defects in graphene is limited if graphenide oxidation is carried out before exposing thematerial to water, and that gas removal of water before the incorporation of pre&#8208;oxidizedgraphene is advantageous for the long&#8208;term stability of the EdG.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Detrimental Functional Groups in Conductive Additives Toward High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conductive additives are of great importance for the adequate utilization of active materials in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries by establishing conductive networks in the composite cathode. However, it usually causes severe interfacial side reactions with solid electrolytes, especially sulfide electrolytes, leading to sluggish ion transportation and accelerated performance degradation. Herein, a simple hydrogen thermal reduction process is proposed on a commonly used conductive additive Super P, which effectively removes the surface oxygen functional groups and weakens the interfacial side reactions with sulfide. With a small amount of 1 wt% reduced Super P, ASSLBs demonstrates a competitive capacity of 180.2 mAh g&#8208;1, which is much higher than the 130.8 mAh g&#8208;1 of untreated Super P. Impressively, reduced Super P based ASSLBs also exhibit a higher capacity retention of 81.8% than 64.6% of untreated Super P. The cathode interfacial chemical evolutions reveal that reduced Super P could effectively alleviate the side reactions of sulfide. Reduced Super P shows better reversible capacity compared to reduced carbon nanofiber with almost no loss of capacity retention, due to its more complete conductive network. Our results highlight the importance of oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups for conductive additives, lightening the prospect of low&#8208;cost 0D conductive additives for practical ASSLBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Carbene Transformations for the Construction of All&#8208;Carbon Quaternary Centers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric catalytic carbene reactions have been well documented in the last few decades for the expeditious assembly of chiral molecules with structural diversity. However, the enantioselective construction of all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers remains a challenge in this area. In this review article, two types of asymmetric carbene reactions that beyond cyclopropanation, cyclopropenation, and B&#252;chner reaction, have been summarized for the construction of all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers: 1) using carbene species as a 1C synthon that reacts with a trisubstituted prochiral center; 2) sequential installation of two different C&#8208;C bonds on the carbene position, which features a gem&#8208;difunctionalization reaction. Especially, the asymmetric metal carbene gem&#8208;dialkylation process, which has emerged as a practical and versatile method for the expeditious assembly of complex architectures from readily available chemical resources, is a complementary approach for the expeditious assembly of all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers.</dc:description>

         <title>Spiropyran&#8208;Based Photoisomerizable &#945;&#8208;Amino Acid for Membrane&#8208;Active Peptide Modification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoisomerizable peptides are promising drug candidates in photopharmacology. While azobenzene&#8208; and diarylethene&#8208;containing photoisomerizable peptides have already demonstrated their potential in this regard, reports on the use of spiropyrans to photoregulate bioactive peptides are still scarce. This work focuses on the design and synthesis of a spiropyran&#8208;derived amino acid, (S)&#8208;2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;(6&#180;&#8208;methoxy&#8208;1&#180;,3&#180;,3&#180;&#8208;trimethylspiro&#8208;[2H&#8208;1&#8208;benzopyran&#8208;2,2&#180;&#8208;indolin&#8208;6&#8208;yl])propanoic acid, which is suitable for the preparation of photoisomerizable peptides. The utility of this amino acid is demonstrated by incorporating it into the backbone of BP100, a known membrane&#8208;active peptide, and by examining the photoregulation of the membrane perturbation by the spiropyran&#8208;containing peptides. The toxicity of the peptides (against the plant cell line BY&#8208;2), their bacteriotoxicity (E. coli), and actin&#8211;auxin oscillator modulation ability were shown to be significantly dependent on the photoisomeric state of the spiropyran unit.</dc:description>

         <title>3&#8208;Oxidopyridinium Ions Are Versatile Bioorthogonal Dipoles for Use in Cycloadditions with Cyclooctynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#8208;oxidopyridinium ions are water stable and soluble heteroaromatic betaines that behave as latent dipoles and undergo a wide variety of cycloadditions. Research into the cycloaddition reactions of 3&#8208;oxidopyridiniums was spearheaded by Alan R. Katritzky and collaborators from the early 1970s until the late 1980s, but they have yet to be used for bioorthogonal applications. Herein we report that 3&#8208;oxidopyridiniums can readily react with 4&#8208;dibenzocyclooctynol (DIBO), a common bioorthogonal handle, in a [3+2] cycloaddition. The mechanism was investigated by altering the electronics of the reaction by changing the substituent on the 5 position of the pyridinium. Electron&#8208;donating 5&#8208;substituents have been shown to significantly increase the rate of the reaction, with bimolecular rate constants ranging from 0.003 M&#8208;1s&#8208;1 with 5&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;N&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;oxidopyridinium to 1.07 M&#8208;1s&#8208;1 with 5&#8208;amino&#8208;N&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;oxidopyridinium. 3&#8208;oxidopyridiniums&#8217; appreciable cycloaddition rates and compatibility with bioorthogonally relevant environments give them the potential to be used in a variety of bioconjugation applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Reduction&#8208;Specified Coupling Reactions of Nitroarenes by Heterogeneous Cobalt Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Being different from conventional reductive coupling reactions of nitroarenes, structurally modifiable heterogeneous cobalt catalysts reveal excellent performance in precise use of a single intermediate during the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of the nitroarenes. This concept would provide a novel direction for the efficient utilization of nitroaromatics in the manufacture of high&#8208;value products.







Abstract
The in&#8208;depth study on reduction&#8211;specified coupling reactions of the nitroarenes by heterogeneous cobalt catalysis opens a door for diversified syntheses of functional N&#8208;containing molecules. Guided by the structure&#8211;function relationship of heterogeneous materials, rational design of nano&#8211;catalysts can effectively regulate the routes of organic reactions. Precise transformation of the intermediates generated during the nitroarene reduction with a suitable nano&#8211;catalyst is a promising way to develop new tandem reactions, and to synthesize structurally novel compounds that are of difficult access with the conventional approaches.

         <title>Mechanochemical C&#8722;H Arylation and Alkylation of Indoles Using 3&#8201;d Transition Metal and Zero&#8208;Valent Magnesium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report our recent discovery of mechanochemical C&#8722;H arylation and alkylation reaction of indoles using 3&#8201;d transition metal (iron and cobalt) via online preparation of highly sensitive organomagnesium reagents. This method addresses the limitations of the 3&#8201;d transition&#8208;metal catalytic C&#8722;H functionalization, and provides an efficient, concise, and sustainable approach for this field.







Abstract
Although the 3&#8201;d transition&#8208;metal catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization have been extensively employed to promote the formation of valuable carbon&#8208;carbon bonds, the persistent problems, including the use of sensitive Grignard reagents and the rigorous operations (solvent&#8208;drying, inert gas protection, metal pre&#8208;activation and RMgX addition rate control), still leave great room for further development of sustainable methodologies. Herein, we report a mechanochemical technology toward in&#8208;situ preparation of highly sensitive organomagnesium reagents, and thus building two general 3&#8201;d transition&#8208;metal catalytic platforms that enables regioselective arylation and alkylation of indoles with a wide variety of halides (including those containing post transformable functionalities and heteroaromatic rings). This mechanochemical strategy also brings unique reactivity and high step&#8208;economy in producing functionalized N&#8208;free indole products.

         <title>Photopharmacology of Protease Inhibitors: Current Status and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
No fear of the dark. Photopharmacology is an emerging technique in which bioactive molecules are turned on (or turned off) by means of light. This enables a spatial and temporal control of their activity. In this review, we discuss the progress of photopharmacology in the field protease inhibitors.







Abstract
Proteases are involved in many essential biological processes. Dysregulation of their activity underlies a wide variety of human diseases. Photopharmacology, as applied on various classes of proteins, has the potential to assist protease research by enabling spatiotemporal control of protease activity. Moreover, it may be used to decrease side&#8208;effects of protease&#8208;targeting drugs. In this review, we discuss the current status of the chemical design of photoactivatable proteases inhibitors and their biological application. Additionally, we give insight into future possibilities for further development of this field of research.

         <title>Organic Molecules Mimic Alkali Metals Enabling Spontaneous Harpoon Reactions with Halogens</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Octamethylcalix[4]pyrrole (omC4P) behaves like alkali metals and reacts with halogens (X) via the harpoon mechanism to form charge&#8208;separated omC4P+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;X&#8722; complexes.harpoon reactionlong range electron transferphotoelectron spectroscopy







Abstract
The harpoon mechanism has been a milestone in molecular reaction dynamics. Until now, the entity from which electron harpooning occurs has been either alkali metal atoms or non&#8208;metallic analogs in their excited states. In this work, we demonstrate that a common organic molecule, octamethylcalix[4] pyrrole (omC4P), behaves just like alkali metal atoms, enabling the formation of charge&#8208;separated ionic bonding complexes with halogens omC4P+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;X&#8722; (X=F&#8722;I, SCN) via the harpoon mechanism. Their electronic structures and chemical bonding were determined by cryogenic photoelectron spectroscopy of the corresponding anions and confirmed by theoretical analyses. The omC4P+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;X&#8722; could be visualized to form from the reactants omC4P+X via electron harpooning from omC4P to X at a distance defined by the energy difference between the ionization potential of omC4P and electron affinity of X.

         <title>Hierarchical Porous Aerogels With Multiple Adsorptive Interactions for Dye Wastewater Purification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 10, February 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composite aerogel composed of carboxymethyl chitosan, gelatin and tannic acid&#8208;reduced graphene oxide was successfully fabricated by the freeze&#8208;drying method, which could achieve the adsorption of multiple types of dye (such as methylene blue and methyl orange) due to the generation of hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interactions and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacks with dyes.







Abstract
Aerogels present a huge potential for removing organic dyes from printing and dyeing wastewater (PDW). However, the preparation of aerogels with multiple dye adsorption capabilities remains a challenge, as many existing aerogels are limited to adsorbing only a single type of dye. Herein, a composite aerogel (CG/T&#8208;rGO) with the addition of carboxymethyl chitosan, gelatin and tannic acid reduced graphene oxide (T&#8208;rGO) was synthesized by freeze&#8208;drying technology. The electrostatic interactions between dye molecular and GEL/CMCS (CG) networks, as well as the supramolecular interactions (H&#8208;bonds, electrostatic interactions and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacks) between T&#8208;rGO, have endowed the aerogel with the ability to adsorb multiple types of dye, such as methylene blue (MB) and methyl orange (MO). Results exhibited that the prepared CG/T&#8208;rGO aerogel possessed strong mechanical strength and a porous 3D network structure with a porosity of 96.33&#8201;%. Using MB and MO as adsorbates, the adsorption capacity (88.2&#8197;mg/g and 66.6&#8197;mg/g, respectively) and the mechanism of the CG/T&#8208;rGO aerogel were investigated. The adsorption processes of aerogel for MB and MO were shown to follow the pseudo&#8208;second&#8208;order kinetic model and Langmuir isotherm model, indicating the chemical adsorption of a monolayer. The proposed aerogel in this work has promising prospects for dye removal from PDW.

         <title>A Primer on 2D Descriptors in Selectivity Modeling for Asymmetric Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 10, February 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in modeling catalyst selectivity by using 2D structures of catalysts and substrates are highlighted in this brief review. Two&#8208;dimensional descriptors offer the advantage of lower cost and higher speed in calculations than quantum chemical parameters. We provide an overview of a typical quantitative structure&#8208;property relationship workflow, including model building and validation techniques, as well as applications of these methodologies in the design of asymmetric catalysis.







Abstract
Machine learning has permeated all fields of research, including chemistry, and is now an integral part of the design of novel compounds with desired properties. In the field of asymmetric catalysis, the preference still lies with models based on a physical understanding of the catalysis phenomenon and the electronic and steric properties of catalysts. However, such models require quantum chemical calculations and are thus limited by their computational cost. Here, we highlight the recent advances in modeling catalyst selectivity by using the 2D structures of catalysts and substrates.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Recent advances in modeling&lt;/b&gt; catalyst selectivity by using 2D structures of catalysts and substrates are highlighted in this brief review. Two-dimensional descriptors offer the advantage of lower cost and higher speed in calculations than quantum chemical parameters. We provide an overview of a typical quantitative structure-property relationship workflow, including model building and validation techniques, as well as applications of these methodologies in the design of asymmetric catalysis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machine learning has permeated all fields of research, including chemistry, and is now an integral part of the design of novel compounds with desired properties. In the field of asymmetric catalysis, the preference still lies with models based on a physical understanding of the catalysis phenomenon and the electronic and steric properties of catalysts. However, such models require quantum chemical calculations and are thus limited by their computational cost. Here, we highlight the recent advances in modeling catalyst selectivity by using the 2D structures of catalysts and substrates. While these have a less explicit mechanistic connection to the modeled property, 2D descriptors, such as topological indices, molecular fingerprints, and fragments, offer the tremendous advantages of low cost and high speed of calculations. This makes them optimal for the in-silico screening of large amounts of data. We provide an overview of common quantitative structure-property relationship workflow, model building and validation techniques, applications of these methodologies in asymmetric catalysis design, and an outlook on improving the understanding of 2D-based models.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Preparation of carbon&#8208;coated Fe2O3@Ti3C2Tx composites by mussel&#8208;like modifications as high&#8208;performance anodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 10, February 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;coated Fe2O3@Ti3C2Tx composites as high&#8208;performance anode were synthesized by a mussel&#8208;like modification method, where electronegative group (&#8722;OH) on polydopamine can easily coordinate with Fe3+ ions as well as form hydrogen bonds with the &#8722;OH terminal group on the Ti3C2Tx surface, which induces a uniform distribution of Fe2O3 on the Ti3C2Tx surface. Meanwhile, the polydopamine&#8208;derived carbon layer protects Ti3C2Tx from oxidation.







Abstract
Fe2O3 with high theoretical capacity (1007&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1) and low cost is a potential anode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), but its practical application is restricted by its low electrical conductivity and large volume changes during lithiation/delithiation. To solve these problems, Fe2O3@Ti3C2Tx composites were synthesized by a mussel&#8208;like modification method, which relies on the self&#8208;polymerization of dopamine under mild conditions. During polymerization, the electronegative group (&#8722;OH) on dopamine can easily coordinate with Fe3+ ions as well as form hydrogen bonds with the &#8722;OH terminal group on the surface of Ti3C2Tx, which induces a uniform distribution of Fe2O3 on the Ti3C2Tx surface and mitigates self&#8208;accumulation of MXene nanosheets. In addition, the polydopamine&#8208;derived carbon layer protects Ti3C2Tx from oxidation during the hydrothermal process, which can further improve the electrical conductivity of the composites and buffer the volume expansion and particle agglomeration of Fe2O3. As a result, Fe2O3@Ti3C2Tx anodes exhibit ~100&#8201;% capacity retention with almost no capacity loss at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 250 cycles, and a stable capacity of 430&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 500 cycles. The unique structural design of this work provides new ideas for the development of MXene&#8208;based composites in energy storage applications.

         <title>Chiral 4&#8208;MeO&#8208;Pyridine (MOPY) Catalyst for Enantioselective Cyclopropanation: Attenuation of Lewis Basicity Leads to Improved Catalytic Efficiency</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 10, February 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational design of Lewis base catalyst by fine&#8208;tuning of pyridine Lewis basicity has allowed for the development of chiral 4&#8208;MeO&#8208;pyridine (MOPY) catalyst for enantioselective cyclopropanation.







Abstract
The design of pyridine&#8208;derived organocatalysts aims at the increase of their Lewis basicity, however such an approach is not always efficient. For example, strongly Lewis basic DMAP is completely inefficient as catalyst in the cyclopropanation reaction. Herein we disclose an alternative approach that relies on attenuation of DMAP Lewis basicity. Specifically, the replacement of 4&#8208;dimethylamino substituent in DMAP for 4&#8208;MeO group delivered a highly efficient catalyst for cyclopropanation of electron&#8208;deficient olefins with &#945;&#8208;bromoketones. Kinetic studies provide compelling evidence that the superior catalytic efficiency of 4&#8208;MeO pyridine (MOPY) is to be attributed to the favorable balance between Lewis basicity and leaving group ability. The use of chiral, enantiomerically pure MOPY catalyst has helped to achieve high enantioselectivities (up to 91&#8201;:&#8201;9 er) in the previously unreported pyridine&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation reaction.

         <title>Cucurbit[7]uril&#8208;mediated Histidine Dimerization: Exploring the Structure and Binding Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 10, February 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Histidine amino acid forms a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex with cucurbit[7]uril (CB7), as confirmed using X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments. The affinity of histidine in oligopeptides strongly depends on the neighbouring residues in the sequence, with the strongest binding observed for Tyr&#8208;His and Leu&#8208;His.







Abstract
Cucurbit[7,8]urils are known to form inclusion complexes with hydrophobic amino acids such as Trp, Tyr, Phe, and Met, as well as peptides containing these residues at the N&#8208;terminus. Despite their widespread use in protein purification, the affinity of histidine (His) for cucurbit[7,8]urils has not been extensively explored. In this study, X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments were conducted to investigate the binding of two histidine moieties to the cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) cavity, resulting in a network of &#960;&#8211;&#960; and hydrogen bonds. This assembly was found to induce a His pKa shift of &#916;pKa=&#8722;4. Histidine weakly bound to CB7 or CB8; however, isothermal titration calorimetry revealed micromolar equilibrium dissociation constant values for CB7 and CB8 when bound to dipeptides containing His at the C&#8208;terminus. Conversely, dipeptides with His at the N&#8208;terminus exhibited millimolar values. Additionally, the His&#8208;Gly&#8208;Gly tripeptide formed a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex with CB7. These findings suggest the potential use of histidine and histidine&#8208;containing tags in conjunction with CB7 for various biological applications.

         <title>Hole&#8208;Transporting Materials based on Oligo(hetero)aryls with a Naphthodithiophene Core &#8211; Succinct Synthesis by Twofold Direct C&#8722;H Olefination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 10, February 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H cross&#8208;dehydrogenative couplings (direct C&#8722;H olefinations) are used as key step to access small&#8208;molecule hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs). NDT core&#8208;based HTMs incorporating additional olefins as &#960;&#8208;spacers substantially improve the PCE of perovskite solar cells of up to 17.2&#8201;%.







Abstract
This work demonstrated the first synthetic application of direct C&#8722;H olefinations in the step&#8208;saving preparation of various hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTM) for efficient perovskite solar cells (PSC). Cross&#8208;dehydrogenative couplings of naphthodithiophene (NDT) with vinyl arenes under palladium&#8208;catalysis facilely generated various new oligo(hetero)aryls with internal alkenes. Reaction conditions were optimized, which gave the product isolated yields of up to 71&#8201;% with high (E)&#8208;stereoselectivity.

     alt="Hole-Transporting Materials based on Oligo(hetero)aryls with a Naphthodithiophene Core &#8211; Succinct Synthesis by Twofold Direct C&#8722;H Olefination"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time, C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H cross-dehydrogenative couplings (direct C&#8722;H olefinations) are used as key step to access small-molecule hole-transporting materials (HTMs). NDT core-based HTMs incorporating additional olefins as &#960;-spacers substantially improve the PCE of perovskite solar cells of up to 17.2&#8201;%.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work demonstrated the first synthetic application of direct C&#8722;H olefinations in the step-saving preparation of various hole-transporting materials (HTM) for efficient perovskite solar cells (PSC). Cross-dehydrogenative couplings of naphthodithiophene (NDT) with vinyl arenes under palladium-catalysis facilely generated various new oligo(hetero)aryls with internal alkenes. Reaction conditions were optimized, which gave the product isolated yields of up to 71&#8201;% with high (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-stereoselectivity. These readily accessible NDT core-based small molecules involving olefin as &#960;-spacers displayed immediate power conversion efficiencies of up to 17.2&#8201;% without a device oxidation process that is required for the commercially available &lt;b&gt;spiro&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;OMeTAD&lt;/b&gt; and most other existing HTMs while fabricated in corresponding PSC devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
The covalent anchoring of electron acceptors derived of [6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;fullerene&#8208;methyl butyrate (PC61BM and PC71BM) to carbon dots (CD) was carried out successfully and the obtained hybrid nanomaterials characterized by means of AFM microscopy, and FTIR and XPS spectroscopies. Electrochemical and photophysical studies confirmed the electronic communication between the covalently connected units and their promise for further photo&#8208; and electronic applications.







Abstract
The covalent incorporation of C60 and C70 derivatives of the well&#8208;known n&#8208;type organic semiconductor PCBM ([6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester) onto carbon dots (CD) is described. Morphological and structural characterization reveal combined features of both pristine starting materials (CD and PCBM). Electrochemical investigations evidenced the existence of additional reduction processes to that of CD or PCBM precursors, showing rich electron&#8208;acceptor capabilities, with multistep processes in an affordable and narrow electrochemical window (ca. 1.5&#8197;V). Electronic communication in the obtained nanoconjugated species were derived from steady&#8208;state absorption and emission spectroscopies, which showed bathochromically shifted absorptions and emissions well entering the red region. Finally, the lower fluorescence quantum yield of CD&#8208;PCBM nanoconjugates, compared with CD, and the fast decay of the observed emission of CD, support the existence of an electronic communication between both CD and PCBM units in the excited state.

         <title>Aerobic Catalytic Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling of Furans with Indoles Provides Access to Fluorophores with Large Stokes Shift</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 10, February 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a general cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling between furans and indoles using earth&#8208;abundant metal catalyst FeCl3.6H2O in presence of oxygen. The reaction displayed scalability and aqueous compatibility, thus making it practical, operationally simple, and sustainable. The products were found to possess fluorescence properties with remarkable Stokes&#8217; shift of upto 205&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Sustainability in chemical processes is a crucial aspect in contemporary chemistry with sustainable catalysis as a vital parameter of the same. There has been a renewed focus on utilizing earth&#8208;abundant metal catalysts to expand the repertoire of organic reactions. Furan is a versatile heterocycle of natural origin used for multiple applications. However, it has scarcely been used in cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling. In this work, we have explored the cross&#8208;dehydrogentive coupling of furans with indoles using commonly available, inexpensive FeCl3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6H2O (&lt;0.25&#8197;$/g) as catalyst in the presence of so called &#8216;ultimate oxidant&#8217; &#8211; oxygen, without the need for any external ligand or additive. The reactions were found to be scalable and to work even under partially aqueous conditions. This makes the reaction highly economical, practical, operationally simple and sustainable. The methodology provides direct access to &#960;&#8208;conjugated short oligomers consisting of furan, thiophene and indole. These compounds were found to show interesting fluorescence properties with remarkably large Stokes shift (up to 205&#8197;nm). Mechanistic investigations reveal that the reaction proceeds through chemoselective oxidation of indole by the metal catalyst followed by nucleophilic trapping by furan.

         <title>Synthesis of Trifluoromethylated Monoterpenes by an Engineered Cytochrome P450</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 10, February 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carbene transfer reaction was realized in the biosynthetic pathway. Using L&#8208;limonene as the precursor, L&#8208;carveol was biotransformed by P411&#8208;PFA to generate unnatural terpenoid derivatives with trifluoromethyl group.







Abstract
Protein engineering of cytochrome P450s has enabled these biocatalysts to promote a variety of abiotic reactions beyond nature&#8216;s repertoire. Integrating such non&#8208;natural transformations with microbial biosynthetic pathways could allow sustainable enzymatic production of modified natural product derivatives. In particular, trifluoromethylation is a highly desirable modification in pharmaceutical research due to the positive effects of the trifluoromethyl group on drug potency, bioavailability, and metabolic stability. This study demonstrates the biosynthesis of non&#8208;natural trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted cyclopropane derivatives of natural monoterpene scaffolds using an engineered cytochrome P450 variant, P411&#8208;PFA. P411&#8208;PFA successfully catalyzed the transfer of a trifluoromethyl carbene from 2&#8208;diazo&#8208;1,1,1&#8208;trifluoroethane to the terminal alkenes of several monoterpenes, including L&#8208;carveol, carvone, perilla alcohol, and perillartine, to generate the corresponding trifluoromethylated cyclopropane products. Furthermore, integration of this abiotic cyclopropanation reaction with a reconstructed metabolic pathway for L&#8208;carveol production in Escherichia coli enabled one&#8208;step biosynthesis of a trifluoromethylated L&#8208;carveol derivative from limonene precursor. Overall, amalgamating synthetic enzymatic chemistry with established metabolic pathways represents a promising approach to sustainably produce bioactive natural product analogs.

         <title>Photophysical Analysis of Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE) Luminogens Based on Triphenylamine and Thiophene: Insights into Emission Behavior in Solution and PMMA Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 10, February 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photophysical analysis of the Triphenylamine&#8722;Thiophene Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission luminogen was conducted in solution and PMMA films. In a solution, emission can arise from either the locally excited (LE) or twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) state, depending on the solvent. In PMMA films, only LE state emission occurs, but excimer&#8208;like formations reduce emission intensity. This effect was probe in Luminescent Solar Concentrator.







Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE) luminogens have garnered significant interest due to their distinctive applications in different applications. Among the diverse molecular architectures, those based on triphenylamine and thiophene hold prominence. However, a comprehensive understanding of the deactivation mechanism both in solution and films remains lacking. In this study, we synthesized and characterized spectroscopically two AIE luminogens: 5&#8208;(4&#8208;(bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)amino)phenyl)thiophene&#8208;2&#8208;carbaldehyde (TTY) and 5&#8242;&#8208;(4&#8208;(bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)amino)phenyl)&#8208;[2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophene]&#8208;5&#8208;carbaldehyde (TTO). Photophysical and theoretical analyses were conducted in both solution and PMMA films to understand the deactivation mechanism of TTY and TTO. In diluted solutions, the emission behavior of TTY and TTO is influenced by the solvent, and the deactivation of the excited state can occur via locally excited (LE) or twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) state. In PMMA films, rotational and translational movements are constrained, necessitating emission solely from the LE state. Nevertheless, in the PMMA film, excimers&#8208;like structures form, resulting in the emergence of a longer wavelength band and a reduction in emission intensity. The zenith of emission intensity occurs when molecules are dispersed at higher concentrations within PMMA, effectively diminishing the likelihood of excimer&#8208;like formations. Luminescent Solar Concentrators (LSC) were fabricated to validate these findings, and the optical efficiency was studied at varying concentrations of luminogen and PMMA.

Nevertheless, in the PMMA film, excimers-like structures form, resulting in the emergence of a longer wavelength band and a reduction in emission intensity. The zenith of emission intensity occurs when molecules are dispersed at higher concentrations within PMMA, effectively diminishing the likelihood of excimer-like formations. Luminescent Solar Concentrators (LSC) were fabricated to validate these findings, and the optical efficiency was studied at varying concentrations of luminogen and PMMA.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of 3&#8208;Phenylserine by a Two&#8208;enzyme Cascade System with PLP Cofactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 10, February 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel cascade system was first proposed for the synthesis of 3&#8208;Phenylserine with transaminase and threonine aldolase. This cascade reaction system can not only facilitate the in&#8197;situ removal of the co&#8208;product benzaldehyde, enhancing the economic viability of the reaction, but also the PLP is utilized as the only cofactor in these reaction system.







Abstract
A two&#8208;enzyme cascade system containing &#969;&#8208;transaminase (&#969;&#8208;TA) and L&#8208;threonine aldolase (L&#8208;ThA) was reported for the synthesis of 3&#8208;Phenylserine starting from benzylamine, and PLP was utilized as the only cofactor in these both two enzymes reaction system. Based on the transamination results, benzylamine was optimized as an advantageous amino donor as confirmed by MD simulation results. This cascade reaction system could not only facilitate the in&#8197;situ removal of the co&#8208;product benzaldehyde, enhancing the economic viability of the reaction, but also establish a novel pathway for synthesizing high&#8208;value phenyl&#8208;serine derivatives. In our study, nearly 95&#8201;% of benzylamine was converted, yielding over 54&#8201;% of 3&#8208;Phenylserine under the optimized conditions cascade reaction.

         <title>Tumor Targeted Cuprous&#8208;Based Nanocomposite as Responsive Cascade Nanocatalyst for Efficient Tumor Synergistic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 10, February 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cascade nanocatalytic reaction system is fabricated. The reasonable combination of the high catalytic efficiency derived from Cu+, in&#8197;situ generation of endogenous H2O2 and consumption of intratumoral glucose induced by GOx, and the upregulation of ROS level evoked by selenocompounds has resulted in the excellent synergistic therapeutic effect in cancer treatment.







Abstract
The single&#8208;functionality of traditional chemodynamic therapy (CDT) reagents usually limits the therapeutic efficacy of cancer treatment. Synergistic nanocomposites that involve cascade reaction provide a promising strategy to achieve satisfactory anticancer effects. Herein, a cuprous&#8208;based nanocomposite (CCS@GOx@HA) is fabricated, which owns the tumor targeting ability and can undergo tumor microenvironment responsive cascade reaction to enhance the tumor therapeutic efficiency significantly. Surface modification of nanocomposite with hyaluronic acid enables the targeted delivery of the nanocomposite to cancer cells. Acid&#8208;triggered decomposition of nanocomposite in cancer cell results in the release of Cu+, Se2&#8722; and GOx. The Cu+ improves the Fenton&#8208;like reaction with endogenous H2O2 to generate highly toxic &#8226;&#8201;OH for CDT. While GOx can not only catalyze the in&#8197;situ generation of endogenous H2O2, but also accelerate the consumption of intratumoral glucose to reduce nutrient supply in tumor site. In addition, Se2&#8722; further improves the therapeutic effects of CDT by upregulating the reactive oxygen species (ROS) in tumor cells. Meanwhile, the surface modification endows the nanocomposite the good water dispersibility and biocompatibility. Moreover, in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo experiments demonstrate satisfactory anti&#8208;cancer therapeutic performance by the synergistic cascade function of CCS@GOx@HA than CDT alone.

         <title>Structural Impact of N&#8208;terminal Pyroglutamate in an Amyloid&#8208;&#946;(3&#8208;42) Fibril Probed by Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy</title>

Solid state NMR spectroscopy on fibrils of recombinant, pyroglutamylated [U&#8208;13C,15N]&#8208; pEA&#946;(3&#8208;42) show highly similar &#946;&#8208;strand positions and a conserved turn region around V24 comparable to LS&#8208;shaped A&#946;(1&#8208;42) fibrils. Due to missing D1&#8208;A2 and pE3 formation a salt bridge of K28&#8208;D1' is absent in pEA&#946;(3&#8208;42) fibrils. G37&#8208;G38 act as sensors for the N&#8208;terminal modifications in pEA&#946;(3&#8208;42) fibrils.







Abstract
Extracellular amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) plaques, primarily formed by A&#946;(1&#8208;40) and A&#946;(1&#8208;42) fibrils, are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. The A&#946; peptide can undergo a high variety of different post&#8208;translational modifications including formation of a pyroglutamate (pGlu, pE) at N&#8208;terminal Glu3 or Glu11 of truncated A&#946;(3&#8208;x) or A&#946;(11&#8208;x), respectively. Here we studied structural similarities and differences between pEA&#946;(3&#8208;42) and LS&#8208;shaped A&#946;(1&#8208;42) fibrils grown under identical conditions (pH&#8197;2) using solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. We show that the central region of pEA&#946;(3&#8208;42) fibrils including the turn region around V24 is almost identical to A&#946;(1&#8208;42) showing similar &#946;&#8208;strands also at the N&#8208;terminus. The missing N&#8208;terminal residues D1&#8208;A2 along with pE3 formation in pEA&#946;(3&#8208;42) preclude a salt bridge between K28&#8208;D1' as in A&#946;(1&#8208;42) fibrils. G37 and G38 act as highly sensitive internal sensors for the modified N&#8208;terminus, which remains rigid over ~five pH units.

The reactions of XeF6 and CrO2F2 in anhydrous HF and melts yield the dinuclear Cr(VI) oxyfluoro&#8208;dianion salts, [XeF5]2[Cr2O4F6], [XeF5]2[Cr2O4F6]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4HF, [XeF5]2[Cr2O4F6]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2XeOF4, and the mononuclear Cr(VI) dianion salt, [XeF5][Xe2F11][CrO2F4]. The salts were structurally characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. Gas&#8208;phase quantum&#8208;chemical calculations show that the intimately ion&#8208;paired cations and dianions interact through Xe&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;F &#963;&#8208;hole bonds.







Abstract
The fluorobasic character of the strong oxidative fluorinator, XeF6, and the oxidative resistance of the [XeF5]+ and [Xe2F11]+ cations have been exploited for the syntheses of several novel Cr(VI) dianion salts. The reactions of XeF6 and CrO2F2 in anhydrous HF and by direct fusion of the reactants in melts have yielded the first dinuclear Cr(VI) oxyfluoro&#8208;dianion salts, [XeF5]2[Cr2O4F6], [XeF5]2[Cr2O4F6]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4HF, [XeF5]2[Cr2O4F6]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2XeOF4, and mononuclear Cr(VI) oxyfluoro&#8208;dianion salt, [XeF5][Xe2F11][CrO2F4]. The salts were structurally characterized by low&#8208;temperature (LT) single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) and LT Raman spectroscopy. The [CrO2F4]2&#8722; and [Cr2O4F6]2&#8722; dianions have distorted octahedral cis&#8208;dioxo Cr(VI) coordination spheres in which two F&#8208;atoms are trans to one another and two F&#8208;atoms are trans to O&#8208;atoms, where the [Cr2O4F6]2&#8722; dianion is the fluorine&#8208;bridged dimer of the [CrO2F3]&#8722; anion. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations were used to obtain the energy&#8208;minimized, gas&#8208;phase geometries, and the calculated vibrational spectra of the gas&#8208;phase dianions and their ion&#8208;pairs, which were used to aid in the vibrational frequency assignments of the crystalline salts. NBO and MEPS analyses and SCXRD show these salts are comprised of intimate ion&#8208;pairs in which their cations and anions interact through primarily electrostatic Xe&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;F &#963;&#8208;hole bonds.

&lt;p&gt;The fluorobasic character of the strong oxidative fluorinator, XeF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, and the oxidative resistance of the [XeF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and [Xe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cations have been exploited for the syntheses of several novel Cr(VI) dianion salts.

The salts were structurally characterized by low-temperature (LT) single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) and LT Raman spectroscopy. The [CrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and [Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; dianions have distorted octahedral &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-dioxo Cr(VI) coordination spheres in which two F-atoms are trans to one another and two F-atoms are trans to O-atoms, where the [Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; dianion is the fluorine-bridged dimer of the [CrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anion. Quantum-chemical calculations were used to obtain the energy-minimized, gas-phase geometries, and the calculated vibrational spectra of the gas-phase dianions and their ion-pairs, which were used to aid in the vibrational frequency assignments of the crystalline salts. NBO and MEPS analyses and SCXRD show these salts are comprised of intimate ion-pairs in which their cations and anions interact through primarily electrostatic Xe-&#8201;-&#8201;-F &#963;-hole bonds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhancing Fluorescence in Both Solution and Solid States Induced by Imine Cage Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 10, February 16, 2024. </description>

The imine&#8208;bonded TPE&#8208;cage exhibits a remarkable enhancement (~520&#8208;fold) in fluorescence emission compared to the building block TPE&#8208;TA in both solution and solid states, highlighting the effect of rigidification&#8208;induced fluorescence enhancement.







Abstract
Developing luminescent materials that exhibit strong emissions in both solution and solid phases is highly desirable and challenging. Herein, we report imine&#8208;bond directed formation of a rigid organic cage (TPE&#8208;cage) that was synthesized by [2+4] imine condensation of a TPE&#8208;cored tetra&#8208;aldehyde (TPE&#8208;TA) with a clip&#8208;like diamine (XA) to illustrate confinement&#8208;induced fluorescence enhancement. Compared to the non&#8208;emissive TPE&#8208;TA (&#981;F=0.26&#8201;%) in the dichloromethane (DCM) solution, the TPE&#8208;cage achieved a remarkable (~520&#8208;fold) emission enhancement (&#981;F=70.38&#8201;%). In contrast, a monomeric tetra&#8208;imine model compound (TPE&#8208;model) showed only a minor enhancement (&#981;F=0.56&#8201;%) in emission compared to the parent tetra&#8208;aldehyde TPE&#8208;TA. The emission of TPE&#8208;cage was further enhanced by ~1.5&#8208;fold (&#981;F=80.96&#8201;%) in the aggregated state owing to aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE). This approach establishes the potential for synthesizing luminescent materials with high emission in both solution and solid&#8208;state by employing a single&#8208;step imine condensation reaction.

         <title>Pertechnetate/perrhenate&#8208;capped Zr/Hf&#8208;Dihydroxide Dimers: Elucidating Zr&#8722;TcO4 Co&#8208;Mobility in the Nuclear Fuel Cycle</title>

The well&#8208;known Zr/Hf4&#8208;tetramer is cleaved in aqueous solutions by perrhenate/pertechnetate to yield a dihydroxide dimer capped by these oxoanions. Structure and solution characterization of this complex along with solvent extraction studies elucidates 93Zr&#8208;99Tc co&#8208;extraction (two of the most abundant and problematic 235U fission products) during nuclear fuel reprocessing.







Abstract
Spent nuclear fuel contains heavy element fission products that must be separated for effective reprocessing for a safe and sustainable nuclear fuel cycle. 93Zr and 99Tc are high&#8208;yield fission products that co&#8208;transport in liquid&#8208;liquid extraction processes. Here we seek atomic&#8208;level information of this co&#8208;extraction process, as well as fundamental knowledge about ZrIV (and HfIV) aqueous speciation in the presence of topology&#8208;directing ligands such as pertechnetate (TcO4&#8722;) and non&#8208;radioactive surrogate perrhenate (ReO4&#8722;). In this context, we show that the flat tetrameric oxyhydroxyl&#8208;cluster [MIV4(OH)8(H2O)16]8+ (and related polymers) is dissociated by perrhenate/pertechnetate to yield isostructural dimers, M2(OH)2(XO4&#8722;)6(H2O)6&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H2O (M=Zr/HfIV; X=Re/TcVII), elucidated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. We used these model compounds to understand the pervasive 93Zr&#8208;99Tc coextraction with further speciation studies in water, nitric acid, and tetrabutylphosphate (TBP) &#8208;kerosene; where the latter two media are relevant to nuclear fuel reprocessing. SAXS (small angle X&#8208;ray scattering), compositional evaluation, and where experimentally feasible, ESI&#8208;MS (electrospray ionization mass spectrometry) showed that perrhenate/pertechnetate influence Zr/HfIV&#8208;speciation in water. In Zr&#8208;XO4 solvent extraction studies to simulate fuel reprocessing, we provide evidence that TcO4&#8722; enhances extraction of ZrIV, and compositional analysis of the extracted metal&#8208;complexes (Zr&#8208;ReO4 study) is consistent with the crystallized ZrIV2(OH)2(ReVIIO4&#8722;)6(H2O)6&#8901;dimer.

         <title>Skeletal Editing through Molecular Recombination of 2H&#8208;Indazoles to Azo&#8208;Linked&#8208;Quinazolinones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 10, February 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and environmentally benign single step methodology has been established for selectfluor mediated single atom skeletal manipulation of 2H&#8208;indazoles through internal C&#8208;atom insertion. Water&#8208;O18 labelling experiment confirms the carbonyl oxygen source is H2O.







Abstract
A new protocol by the combinatory use of two equivalent of indazoles starting material with one being the carbon source via its C3&#8208;reactivity and the other, the coupling partner has been developed for the selectfluor&#8208;mediated single atom skeletal editing of 2H&#8208;indazoles. The azo&#8208;linked&#8208;2,3&#8208;disubstituted quinazolin&#8208;4&#8208;one derivatives were obtained through a carbon atom insertion between the two nitrogens of the indazole ring and simultaneous oxidation at C3 position of both indazole moieties. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the amidic carbonyl oxygen of the product is derived from water and the reaction proceeds through in&#8208;situ generated N&#8208;centred indazolone radical intermediate.

     alt="Skeletal Editing through Molecular Recombination of 2H-Indazoles to Azo-Linked-Quinazolinones"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An efficient and environmentally benign single step methodology has been established for selectfluor mediated single atom skeletal manipulation of 2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-indazoles through internal C-atom insertion. Water-O&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; labelling experiment confirms the carbonyl oxygen source is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new protocol by the combinatory use of two equivalent of indazoles starting material with one being the carbon source &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; its C3-reactivity and the other, the coupling partner has been developed for the selectfluor-mediated single atom skeletal editing of 2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-indazoles. The azo-linked-2,3-disubstituted quinazolin-4-one derivatives were obtained through a carbon atom insertion between the two nitrogens of the indazole ring and simultaneous oxidation at C3 position of both indazole moieties. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the amidic carbonyl oxygen of the product is derived from water and the reaction proceeds through in-situ generated &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-centred indazolone radical intermediate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction of a Cyclic Zinc(II) Porphyrin Trimer with an Encapsulated Rhenium(I) Bipyridine Tricarbonyl Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 10, February 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduced a [Re(CO)3Br] fragment into the trimer to create a new heterobimetallic photocatalyst. The presence of ester groups in the Zn porphyrin trimer significantly deactivated CO2 reduction. After converting the ester groups to acetoxymethyl groups, the photocatalytic activity was remarkably enhanced. The modified trimer exhibited Re&#8208;induced phosphorescence, which was quenched by an electron donor, indicating efficient electron transfer during CO2 reduction.







Abstract
We previously reported a cyclic Zn(II) porphyrin trimer in which three Zn porphyrins are alternately bridged by three 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (bpy) moieties, enabling the encapsulation of metal complexes within the nanopore formed by the Zn porphyrins. In this study, we introduced a [Re(CO)3Br] fragment into one of the bpy moieties of the cyclic trimer to form the catalytic Re(4,4&#8217;&#8208;R2&#8208;bpy)(CO)3Br center (R=methyl ester). The ester groups (R) play an important role in the synthesis of the cyclic structure. However, it was observed that these ester groups significantly deactivated the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction. Therefore, we converted the ester groups with a suitable reducing reagent into hydroxymethyl groups, followed by acetylation to form acetoxymethyl groups. This modification remarkably enhanced the photocatalytic activity of the cyclic trimer=Re complex system for CO2 reduction. Moreover, in the modified system, the presence of the Re complex induced room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence of the Zn porphyrin. The phosphorescence was significantly quenched by 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole, indicating that efficient electron transfer mediated by the excited triplet state of the Zn porphyrin occurs during the photocatalytic CO2 reduction.

         <title>Unveiling the Anomaly of Reduction of Carborane&#8208;bis&#8208;silylene&#8208;Stabilised Silylone/Germylone Leading to Unusual Oxidation of Si0/Ge0 to SiI/GeI with EDA&#8208;NOCV Analyses</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 10, February 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The most favourable bonding scenario in carborane&#8208;bis&#8208;silylene stabilized silylone and germylone has been uncovered by density functional calculations and EDA&#8208;NOCV analyses. The interactions between the negatively charged carborane and positively charged bis&#8208;silylene fragments in their doublet states are likely to form one covalent electron&#8208;sharing bond and one covalent dative bond. These findings provide a detailed understanding of the bonding interactions within these species, helping us to infer why the carborane fragment undergoes intramolecular electronic rearrangements, and shed light on the fragments&#8217; stability, distribution of electron densities and often unusual reactivity.







Abstract
Researchers have successfully isolated Si0/Ge0 species, termed silylone and germylone, with two lone pairs of electrons on them. These elusive compounds have been stabilised in singlet ground states by using different donor base ligands. Driess et&#8197;al. in particular have made strides in this area, isolating carborane&#8208;bis&#8208;silylene&#8208;stabilised silylone/germylone and their N+/Pb analogues. Carborane (C2B10H10) plays a pivotal role as a redox&#8208;active ligand, converting from closo&#8208;carborane to nido&#8208;carborane with the addition of two electrons. Notably, anomalous oxidation of Si0/Ge0 centres in carborane&#8208;bis&#8208;silylene&#8208;stabilised species to SiI/GeI has been reported, resulting in the formation of dimeric SiI&#8722;SiI/GeI&#8722;GeI di&#8208;cationic units. The energy decomposition analysis coupled with natural orbital for chemical valence (EDA&#8208;NOCV) study focuses on the carborane&#8208;bis&#8208;silylene ligand in the free state, and its three other species, including silylone/germylone species. Interestingly, it reveals that the carborane unit in an anionic doublet state tends to form one electron&#8208;sharing bond and one dative bond with the counter fragment in its cationic doublet state. This helps us to rationalise why the carborane unit undergoes intramolecular electronic rearrangements leading to the formation of a di&#8208;anionic carborane unit with a significantly elongated C&#8722;C bond (2.38&#8211;2.68&#8197;&#197;) and undergoes unusual oxidation of Si0/Ge0 to SiI/GeI.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Responsive Polyoxometalate@Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Involving Ir Metalloligands for Highly Selective Photocatalytic Oxidation of Sulfides to Sulfoxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 10, February 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have synthesized a crystalline POM@MOF (Ir&#8722;SiW) by assembling Ir metalloligands and POMs for the first time. Ir&#8722;SiW has high activity for selective oxidation sulfide to sulfoxide, with a yield of 99.5&#8201;% within 2.5&#8197;h, which is higher than the currently known POM&#8208;based photocatalysts.







Abstract
The synthesis of highly efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive photocatalysts is fundamental to solving the problems of low efficiency and poor selectivity in photocatalytic organic synthesis reactions. We synthesized a crystalline polyoxometalate @metal&#8208;organic framework material {Zn4(H2O)8[Ir(ppy)2(dcbpy)]4[SiW12O40]}&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O (Ir&#8722;SiW) by self&#8208;assembly of Ir metalloligands with POMs. The introduction of Ir metalloligands extends the light absorbing range to visible light, improving the efficient utilization of solar energy. The transfer of photogenerated electrons from Ir metalloligands to SiW12 was observed under visible light irradiation, which boosted the carrier separation efficiency. The synergistic effect of the two components increased the photocatalytic thioether oxidation activity, and the product methyl phenyl sulfoxide for 2.5&#8197;h under visible light irradiation (&#955; &gt;400&#8197;nm) reached 99.5&#8201;%, which was higher than those of other POM&#8208;based photocatalysts. Meanwhile, the yield of methyl phenyl sulfoxide was still higher than 97&#8201;% after three cycles, demonstrating the high stability and reusability of Ir&#8722;SiW.

         <title>Conformations and Rearrangements of Collinolactone &#8211; Experiments and Theory on a Dynamic Cyclodecatriene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 10, February 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a series of new isomers of collinolactone A which were obtained from thermal, and acid promoted rearrangements of the natural product. We are able to rationalize these findings through detailed quantum chemical computations of the involved conformers and their reactions.







Abstract
Collinolactone A is a microbial specialized metabolite with a unique 6&#8208;10&#8208;7 tricyclic bislactone skeleton which was isolated from Streptomyces bacteria. The unusual cyclodecatriene motif features dynamic interconversions of two rotamers.

     alt="Conformations and Rearrangements of Collinolactone &#8211; Experiments and Theory on a Dynamic Cyclodecatriene"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report a series of new isomers of collinolactone A which were obtained from thermal, and acid promoted rearrangements of the natural product. We are able to rationalize these findings through detailed quantum chemical computations of the involved conformers and their reactions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collinolactone A is a microbial specialized metabolite with a unique 6-10-7 tricyclic bislactone skeleton which was isolated from &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt; bacteria. The unusual cyclodecatriene motif features dynamic interconversions of two rotamers. Given the biological profiling of collinolactone A as neuroprotective agent, semisynthetic modifications represent an invaluable strategy to enhance its efficacy. Since understanding conformations and reactions of bioactive substances is crucial for rational structure-based design and synthesis of derivatives, we conducted computational studies on conformational behavior as well as experiments on thermal and acid induced rearrangements of the cyclodecatriene. Experimental conformer ratios of collinolactone A and its biosynthetic ketolactone precursor are well reproduced by computations at the PW6B95-D3/def2-QZVPP//r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;SCAN-3c level. Upon heating collinolactone A in anhydrous dioxane at 100&#8201;&#176;C, three collinolactone B stereoisomers exhibiting enollactone structures form &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; Cope rearrangements. Our computations predict the energetic preference for a boat-like transition state in agreement with the stereochemical outcome of the main reaction pathway. Constriction of the ten-membered ring forms collinolactone C with four annulated rings and an exocyclic double bond. Computations and semisynthetic experiments demonstrate strong preference for an acid-catalyzed reaction pathway over an alternative Alder-ene route to collinolactone C with a prohibitive reaction barrier, again in line with stereochemical observations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Construction of Ni(II)&#8208;Incorporated Covalent Organic Framework for Metallaphotoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 10, February 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a facile bottom&#8208;up strategy to synthesize Ni(II)&#8208;incorporated covalent organic framework (LZU&#8208;713@Ni) as heterogeneous all&#8208;in&#8208;one metallaphotoredox catalyst. LZU&#8208;713@Ni showed excellent activity and recyclability in photoredox/nickel&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;O, C&#8722;S, and C&#8722;P cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The superiority of bottom&#8208;up strategy was exemplified by the increased activity of LZU&#8208;713@Ni compared to both the dual catalyst system and LZU&#8208;713/Ni prepared via post&#8208;synthetic modification.







Abstract
The construction of an all&#8208;in&#8208;one catalyst, in which the photosensitizer and the transition metal site are close to each other, is important for improving the efficiency of metallaphotoredox catalysis. However, the development of convenient synthetic strategies for the precise construction of an all&#8208;in&#8208;one catalyst remains a challenging task due to the requirement of precise installation of the catalytic sites. Herein, we have successfully established a facile bottom&#8208;up strategy for the direct synthesis of Ni(II)&#8208;incorporated covalent organic framework (COF), named LZU&#8208;713@Ni, as a versatile all&#8208;in&#8208;one metallaphotoredox catalyst. LZU&#8208;713@Ni showed excellent activity and recyclability in the photoredox/nickel&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;O, C&#8722;S, and C&#8722;P cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Notably, this catalyst displayed a better catalytic activity than its homogeneous analogues, physically mixed dual catalyst system, and, especially, LZU&#8208;713/Ni which was prepared through post&#8208;synthetic modification. The improved catalytic efficiency of LZU&#8208;713@Ni should be attributed to the implementation of bottom&#8208;up strategy, which incorporated the fixed, ordered, and abundant catalytic sites into its framework. This work sheds new light on the exploration of concise and effective strategies for the construction of multifunctional COF&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>Construction of Multifunctional Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 10, February 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoactive TAPA&#8722;BPy&#8722;COF and its metalated Pd@TAPA&#8722;BPy&#8722;COF, which can both serve as the efficient reusable photocatalysts for photocatalytic applications, are reported.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have recently drawn intense attention due to their potential applications in photocatalysis. Herein, we report a multifunctional COF which consists of triphenylamine (TPA) and 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (2, 2&#8242;&#8208;bipy) entities. The obtained TAPA&#8722;BPy&#8722;COF is a heterogeneous photocatalyst and can efficiently catalyze the oxidative coupling of thiols to disulfides. In addition, TAPA&#8722;BPy&#8722;COF can be further metalated by Pd(II) via 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipy&#8722;metal coordination. The generated Pd@TAPA&#8722;BPy&#8722;COF can highly promote photocatalytic synthesis of 3&#8208;cyanopyridines via cascade addition/cyclization of arylboronic acids with &#947;&#8208;ketodinitriles in heterogeneous way. This work has demonstrated the way for the rational design and preparation of more efficient photoactive COFs for photocatalysis.

The first general synthesis of &#947;&#8208;fluoro &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes was achieved from the corresponding silyl dienol ethers and N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI). The complete selectivity towards the &#947; position was rationalized thanks to DFT calculations.







Abstract
We describe the direct synthesis of &#947;&#8208;fluoro enals from the corresponding silyl dienol ethers. This simple process operates under mild conditions and is compatible with a wide range of functionalities. The high &#947; regioselectivity of this protocol was rationalized by means of theoretical calculations.

         <title>Ferrocenyl Dinuclear Gold(I) Complexes. Study of their Structural Features and the Influence of Bridging and Phosphane Ligands in a Catalytic Cyclization Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 10, February 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dinuclear gold(I) complexes with ferrocenylphosphane and different bridging ligands such as, chloride or pentafluorophenylthiolate have a significant influence in their reactivity. Chloride&#8208;bridged complexes excel as highly efficient catalysts, while thiolate&#8208;bridged ones exhibit varied conversion rates. Additionally, the use of monophosphane or diphosphane ligands introduces intriguing performance differences, offering prospects for customized catalytic systems.







Abstract
The combination of the ferrocene moiety with gold(I) catalysis remains a relatively unexplored field. In this article, we delve into the synthesis, characterization, and potential catalytic activity of four complexes utilizing both monodentate and bidentate ferrocenyl diphenylphosphane ligands (ppf and dppf), coordinated with two gold(I) metal centers, linked by either chloride or pentafluorophenylthiolate bridging ligands. This leads to the formation of cationic &#8220;self&#8208;activated&#8221; precatalysts capable of initiating the catalytic cycle without the need for external additives. The catalytic activity of these complexes was assessed through a model reaction in gold(I) catalysis, specifically the cyclization of a N&#8208;propargylbenzamide to produce an oxazole. In addition, we studied and compared the influence exerted by both the phosphane and the bridging ligand on the performance of these catalysts.

Abstract
A simple and effective organolithium approach to the synthesis of 2&#8208;substituted benzo[cd]indoles from peri&#8208;dihalonaphthalenes and nitriles has been developed. The reaction proceeds via a surprisingly easy intramolecular aromatic nucleophilic substitution facilitated by the &#8220;clothespin effect&#8221;. The discovered transformation provides good isolated yields, allows usage of an extensive range of nitriles, and demonstrates a good substituents tolerance. UV&#8208;absorption and NMR spectra of the obtained benzo[cd]indoles and their protonated forms demonstrated exclusive protonation to the indole nitrogen atom even in the presence of two NMe2 groups in positions 5 and 6 (i.&#8201;e. &#8220;proton sponge&#8221; moiety).

         <title>General Construction of Asymmetric Amine Ethers via Efficient Transesterification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 10, February 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of asymmetric amine ethers proceeds via efficient transesterification. Two tertiary amine alcohol hydrogen sulfates are prepared in high yields and applied as intermediates of transesterification to synthesize asymmetric amine ethers, which has significant advantages over the conventional process.







Abstract
A novel method to prepare asymmetric amine ethers is reported. Tertiary amine alcohol hydrogen sulfate intermediates are prepared through a reactive distillation process, followed by the transesterification process to afford eventually asymmetric amine ethers. Experiments and DFT calculations revealed the essential roles the sulfate group plays in the highly selective monoesterification process. This clean method is tolerant towards various functional groups with good yields under mild condition, which is obviously superior compared to the conventional processes.

         <title>Dynamic Configuration on a Chiral&#8208;at&#8208;Rhodium Catalyst Featuring a Flexible Tetradentate Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 10, February 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal catalyst with a dynamic configuration has been successfully synthesized and subsequently resolved. Both experimental and DFT studies show that the stereogenic rhodium center preserves its chiral information. Furthermore, the resolved complex provides enantiomeric ratios of up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 in the catalytic Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation of indoles. These findings highlight its immense potential in asymmetric catalysis.







Abstract
The unique dynamic configuration of an enantioselective chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal catalyst based on Rh(III) and a non&#8208;chiral tetradentate ligand is described and resolved. At room temperature, the catalyst undergoes a dynamic configuration process leading to the formation of two interconvertible metal&#8208;stereoisomers, remarkably without racemization. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that this metal&#8208;isomerization proceeds via a concerted transition state, which features a trigonal bipyramidal geometry stabilized by the tetradentate ligand. Furthermore, the resolved enantiopure complex shows high catalytic enantioinduction in the Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction, achieving enantiomeric ratios as high as 99&#8201;:&#8201;1.

         <title>Hybrid Membrane Composed of Nickel Diselenide Nanosheets with Carbon Nanotubes for Catalytic Conversion of Polysulfides in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 10, February 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid membrane composed of nickel diselenide nanosheets (NSN) modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs) has been succeeded in preparing via hydrothermal and vacuum filtration technology. The three&#8208;dimensional networks of CNTs facilitate the transport of electrons and ions. In this process, NSN acts as catalytic centers, thereby accelerating the redox conversion of polysulfide species remarkably elevating the cycle performance of the battery.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries demonstrate enormous energy density are promising forms of energy storage. Unfortunately, the slow redox kinetics and polysulfides shuttle effect are some of the factors that prevent the its development. To address these issues, the hybrid membrane with combination of nickel diselenide nanosheets modified carbon nanotubes (NSN@CNTs) and utilized Li2S6 catholyte for lithium sulfur battery. The conductive CNTs facilitates fast electronic/ionic transport, while the polarity of NSN as a strong affinity to lithium polysulfides, effectively anchoring them, facilitating the redox conversion of polysulfide species, and effectively diminishing reaction barriers. The cell with NSN@CNTs delivers the first discharge capacity of 1123.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and maintains 786.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 300&#8197;cycles (0.2&#8197;C) at the sulfur loading 5.4&#8197;mg. Its rate capability is commendable, enabling it to sustain a capacity of 559.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 even at a high discharge rate of 2&#8197;C. In addition, its initial discharge capacity can remain 8.33&#8197;mAh even at 10.8&#8197;mg for duration of 100&#8197;cycles. This research indicates the potential application of NSN@CNTs hybrid materials in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.

A ferrocene reflects on the moon surface, illuminating a bridge between two gold metal centers. This imagery captures the use of bridging ligands in the synthesis of ferrocenyl gold(I) dinuclear complexes. Two dragons embody distinct bridging ligands and their consequential structures. The green dragon symbolizes the incorporation of chloride bridging ligands, its pointed gaze directed towards the corresponding molecular structure of the chloronium gold(I) complex. The yellow dragon represents the use of the pentafluorophenylthiolate ligand, visually joined to its intricate X&#8208;ray diffraction structure. These dynamic depictions underscore the pivotal role of these bridging ligands in influencing catalytic reactions, particularly in the context of a cyclization reaction, thus establishing a visually compelling narrative of the study focus and outcomes. More information can be found in the Research Article by J.&#8197;C. P&#233;rez&#8208;S&#225;nchez, R.&#8197;P. Herrera and M.&#8197;C. Gimeno (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303585).

         <title>Substrate Selectivity Imparted by Self&#8208;Assembled Molecular Containers and Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 10, February 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substrate selectivity is the property of catalysts like enzymes to pick up one substrate among many others in solution. To implement substrate selectivity in artificial homogeneous catalysts, an emerging approach in homogeneous catalysis consists in exploiting self&#8208;assembled nano&#8208;catalysts and nanocontainers. The confinement effects provide supramolecular substrate recognition before the catalytic step. This review covers recent achievements in this challenging field of research.







Abstract
Recent trends in catalysis are devoted to mimicking some peculiar features of enzymes like site selectivity, through functional group recognition, and substrate selectivity, through recognition of the entire surface of the substrate. The latter is a specific feature of enzymes that is seldomly present in homogeneous catalysis. Supramolecular catalysis, thanks to the self&#8208;assembly of simple subunits, enables the creation of cavities and surfaces whose confinement effects drive the preferential binding of a substrate among others with consequent substrate selectivity. The topic is an emerging field that exploits recognition phenomena to discriminate the reagents based on their size and shape. This review deals this cutting&#8208;edge field of research covering examples of supramolecular self&#8208;assembled molecular containers and catalysts operating in organic as well as aqueous media, with special emphasis for catalytic systems dealing with direct competitive experiments involving two or more substrates.

         <title>Development of Platinum Complexes for Tumor Chemoimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 10, February 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemoimmunotherapy is a novel treatment for cancers via synergy between chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Pt complexes could be developed into chemoimmunotherapeutic agents as inducers of immunogenic cell death, inhibitors of immune checkpoint, stimulators of immune response, relievers of immunosupression, or modulators of immune signal. They reshape the tumor microenvironment and reinforce the antitumor activity.







Abstract
Platinum complexes are potential antitumor drugs in chemotherapy. Their impact on tumor treatment could be greatly strengthened by combining with immunotherapy. Increasing evidences indicate that the antitumor activity of platinum complexes is not limited to chemical killing effects, but also extends to immunomodulatory actions. This review introduced the general concept of chemoimmunotherapy and summarized the progress of platinum complexes as chemoimmunotherapeutic agents in recent years. Platinum complexes could be developed into inducers of immunogenic cell death, blockers of immune checkpoint, regulators of immune signaling pathway, and modulators of tumor immune microenvironment, etc. The synergy between chemotherapeutic and immunomodulatory effects reinforces the antitumor activity of platinum complexes, and helps them circumvent the drug resistance and systemic toxicity. The exploration of platinum complexes for chemoimmunotherapy may create new opportunities to revive the discovery of metal anticancer drugs.

The quality of separators is thoroughly assessed by systematically analyzing and scrutinizing aspects such as cost, functionality, safety, and environmental sustainability in their preparation. This comprehensive evaluation serves as a guide for the objectives and future directions for separators research of zinc ion batteries.







Abstract
With the increasing demand for low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;safety portable batteries, aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have been regarded as a potential alternative to the lithium&#8208;ion batteries, bringing about extensive research dedicated in the exploration of high&#8208;performance and highly reversible ZIBs. Although separators are generally considered as non&#8208;active components in conventional research on ZIBs, advanced separators designs seem to offer effective solutions to the majority of issues within ZIBs system. These issues encompass concerns related to the zinc anode, cathode, and electrolyte. Initially, we delve into the origins and implications of various inherent problems within the ZIBs system. Subsequently, we present the latest research advancements in addressing these challenges through separators engineering. This includes a comprehensive, detailed exploration of various strategies, coupled with instances of advanced characterizations to provide a more profound insight into the mechanisms that influence the separators. Finally, we undertake a multi&#8208;criteria evaluation, based on application standards for diverse substrate separators, while proposing guiding principles for the optimal design of separators in zinc batteries. This review aims to furnish valuable guidance for the future development of advanced separators, thereby nurturing progress in the field of ZIBs.

         <title>Electrochemical CO2 Reduction by Urea Hangman Mn Terpyridine species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Based on our previous study in chemical subtleties of the  proton tunneling distance for metal hydride formation (PTD&#8208;MH) to regulate the selectivity of CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), we have developed a family of Mn terpyridine derivatives, in which urea groups functioning as multipoint hydrogen&#8208;bonding hangman to accelerate the reaction rate. We found that such changes to the second coordination sphere significantly increased the turnover frequency (TOF) for CO2 reduction to ca. 360 s&#8208;1&#160;with this family of molecular catalysts while maintaining high selectivity (ca. 100% &#177; 3) for CO even in the presence of a large amount of phenol as proton source. Notably, the compounds studied in this manuscript all exhibit large value for CO&#160;as that achieved by Fe porphyrins derivates, while saving up to 0.55 V in overpotential with respect to the latter.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mesoporous metal nanomaterials (MPMNs) are pivotal in nanotechnology, especially in electrochemical applications, due to their unique structure. Unlike traditional nanomaterials, MPMNs possess hierarchical and mesoporous characteristics, providing more active sites for improved mass and electron transfer. This distinctive composition offers dual benefits, enhancing activity, stability, and selectivity for specific reactions. The intricate architecture, featuring interconnected pores, amplifies surface area, ensuring efficient use of active sites and boosting reactivity in electrocatalytic processes. Additionally, the mesoporous nature promotes superior diffusion kinetics, facilitating better transport of reactants and products. This intricate interplay of structural elements contributes not only to the increased efficiency of electrochemical reactions but also to the extended durability of PMNs during prolonged usage. This concept foucs on the synthesis and design strategies of MPMNs, aligning with the dynamic requirements of diverse electrocatalytic applications. The synergy resulting from these advancements not only accentuates the intrinsic properties of MPMNs but also broadens their scope for practical implementation in emerging fields of electrochemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Temperature Control of the Self&#8208;Assembly Process of 4&#8208;Aminoquinoline Amphiphile: Selective Construction of Perforated Vesicles and Nanofibers, and Structural Restoration Capability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of diverse and distinctive self&#8208;assembled structures in water, based on the control of the self&#8208;assembly processes of artificial small molecules, has received considerable attention in supramolecular chemistry. Cage&#8208;like perforated vesicles are distinctive and interesting self&#8208;assembled structures. However, the development of self&#8208;assembling molecules that can easily form perforated vesicles remains challenging. This paper reports a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) behavior&#8208;triggered self&#8208;assembly property of a 4&#8208;aminoquinoline (4&#8208;AQ)&#8208;based amphiphile with a tetra(ethylene glycol) chain, in HEPES buffer (pH 7.4). This property allows to form perforated vesicles after heating at 80 &#176;C (&gt; LCST). The self&#8208;assembly process of the 4&#8208;AQ amphiphile can be controlled by heating at 80 &#176;C (&gt; LCST) or 60 &#176;C (&lt; LCST). After cooling to room temperature, the selective construction of the perforated vesicles and nanofibers was achieved from the same 4&#8208;AQ amphiphile. Furthermore, the perforated vesicles exhibited slow morphological transformation into intertwined&#8208;like nanofibers but were easily restored by brief heating above the LCST.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Investigation of a Soluble Distannene with no Trans&#8208;Bent Angle or Twisting in the Solid&#8208;State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By treating KSiiPr3 with Sn[N(SiMe3)2]2 the distannene Sn2(TIPS)4 (TIPS = iPr3Si) is formed in a metathesis reaction. The crystal structure analysis of Sn2(TIPS)4 reveals a planar arrangement of the substituents in the solid&#8208;state and hence the second planar alkene like distannene of its kind. Due to the TIPS substituents, Sn2(TIPS)4 is well soluble in all commonly used organic solvents, opening the door for various analytics and reactivity studies. Due to its stability in solution, various reactions can be performed such as cycloaddition reactions with 2,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene (DMBD) and TMS&#8208;azide.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Methylation reactions are chemically simple but challenging to perform under mild and non&#8208;toxic conditions. A photochemical energy transfer strategy was merged with copper catalysis to enable fast reaction times of minutes and broad applicability to N&#8208;heterocycles, (hetero&#8208;)aromatic carboxylic acids, and drug&#8208;like molecules in high yields and good functional group tolerance. Detailed mechanistic investigations, using kinetic analysis, aprotic MS, UV/Vis, and luminescence quenching experiments revealed a triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer mechanism between hypervalent iodine(III) reagents and readily available photosensitizers.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization of Lantern&#8208;Type Metal&#8208;Organic Cages (MOCs) by Protective Control of Ligand Exchange Rates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembling systems in nature display remarkable complexity with assemblies of different sub&#8208;units to generate functional species. Synthetic analogues of such systems are a challenge, often requiring the ability to bias distributions that are under thermodynamic assembly control. Using lantern&#8208;type MOCs (metal&#8208;organic cages) as a prototypical self&#8208;assembling system, herein we explore the role that steric bulk plays in controlling the exchange rate of ligands in paddlewheel&#8208;based assemblies, and thus the stability of cages, in competitive self&#8208;assembling scenarios. The effective lifetime of the lantern&#8208;type MOCs varies over an order of magnitude depending on the steric bulk proximal to the metal nodes with lifetimes of the cages ranging from tens of minutes to several hours. The bulk of the coordinating solvents likewise reduces the rate of ligand exchange, and thus yields longer&#8208;lived species. Understanding this subtle effect has implications for controlling the stability of complex assemblies in competitive environments with implications for guest release and application.</dc:description>

         <title>Aggregation/Crystallization&#8208;Induced Emission in Naphthyridine&#8208;Based Carbazolyl&#8208;Modified Donor&#8208;Acceptor Boron Dyes Tunable by Fluorine Atoms</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Four donor&#8208;acceptor boron difluoride complexes based on the carbazole electron donor and the [1,3,5,2]oxadiazaborinino[3,4&#8208;a][1,8]naphthyridine acceptor were designed, synthesized, and systematically spectroscopically investigated in solutions, in dye&#8208;doped polymer films, and in the solid states. The dyes exhibit an intense blue to red solid&#8208;state emission with photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 59% in pure dye samples and 86% in poly(methyl methacrylate) films. All boron complexes show aggregation&#8208;induced emission and reversible mechanofluorochromism. The optical properties of these dyes and their solid state luminescence can be tuned by substitution pattern, i.e., the substituents at the naphthyridine unit. Exchange of CH3&#8208; for CF3&#8208;groups does not only increase the intramolecular charge transfer character, but also provides a crystallization&#8208;induced emission enhancement.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;Glycosylated Soluble Fas Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlled cell death is essential for the regulation of the immune system and plays a role in pathogen defense. It is often altered in pathogenic conditions such as cancer, viral infections and autoimmune diseases. The Fas receptor and its corresponding membrane&#8208;bound ligand (FasL) are part of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway activated in these cases. A soluble form of FasL (sFasL), produced by ectodomain shedding, displays a diverse but still elusive set of non&#8208;apoptotic functions and sometimes even serves as a pro&#8208;survival factor. To gather more knowledge about the characteristics of this protein and the impact N&#8208;glycosylations may have, access to homogeneous posttranslationally modified variants of sFasL is needed. Therefore, we developed a flexible strategy to obtain such homogeneously N&#8208;glycosylated variants of sFasL by applying chemical protein synthesis. This strategy can be flexibly combined with enzymatic methods to introduce more complex, site selective glycosylations.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing the Isolobal Relation between Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;NiP3 and White Phosphorus by Experimental Charge Density Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isolobale principle as established by Hoffmann was tested in this work by the highest level of experimental charge density analysis. X&#8208;ray restrained wavefunction fitting as well as multipolar modelling showed in accord that [Ni]P3 is a suitable isolobale analogue to white phosphorus. The deep dive into its bonding analysis reveals insights about the differences in reactivity compared to P4.







Abstract
An in&#8208;depth analysis of the description of bonding within Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Ni&#8208;cyclo&#8208;P3 (Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;=1,2,4&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcyclopentadienyl, [Ni]P3) employing X&#8208;ray diffraction based multipolar modeling, density functional theory (DFT) as well as an &#8220;experimental wavefunction&#8221; obtained from X&#8208;ray restrained wavefunction (XRW) fitting is presented. The results are compared to DFT calculations on white phosphorus &#8211; an isolobal analogue to [Ni]P3. A complementary bonding analysis shows insights into the reactivity of [Ni]P3. The isolobal principle is reflected in every aspect of our analysis and the employed methods seamlessly predict the differences in reactivity of [Ni]P3 and P4. Crystallographic modeling, solid&#8208;state NMR, and DFT calculations describe the dynamic behavior of the cyclo&#8208;P3 unit in the title molecule.

         <title>Structure and Photophysics of N&#8208;Tolanyl&#8208;phenochalcogenazines and their Radical Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photophysics of a series of N&#8208;tolanyl&#8208;phenochalcogenazines with O, S, Se, and Te heteroatoms is strongly structure&#8208;dependent. Time&#8208;resolved optical spectroscopy and DFT calculations indicate that the O and S dyads possess a pseudo&#8208;equatorial structure and the lowest energy excited singlet state has charge&#8208;transfer character, but the Se and Te dyads possess pseudo&#8208;axial structure and a tolan localised excited state.







Abstract
The study focuses on the structural and photophysical characteristics of neutral and oxidized forms of N&#8208;tolanyl&#8208;phenochalcogenazines PZX&#8208;tolan with X=O, S, Se, and Te. X&#8208;ray crystal structure analyses show a pseudo&#8208;equatorial (pe) structure of the tolan substituent in the O, S, and Se dyads, while the Te dyad possesses a pseudo&#8208;axial (pa) structure. DFT calculations suggest the pe structure for O and S, and the pa structure for Se and Te as stable forms. Steady&#8208;state and femtosecond&#8208;time resolved optical spectroscopy in toluene solution indicate that the O and S dyads emit from a CT state, whereas the Se and Te dyads emit from a tolan&#8208;localized state. The T1 state is tolan&#8208;localized in all cases, showing phosphorescence at 77&#8197;K. The heavy atom effect of chalcogens induces intersystem crossing from S1 to Tx, resulting in a decreasing S1 lifetime from 2.1&#8197;ns to 0.42&#8197;ps. The T1 states possess potential for singlet oxygen sensitization with a high quantum yield (ca. 40&#8201;%) for the O, S, and Se dyads. Radical cations exhibit spin density primarily localized at the heterocycle. EPR measurements and quasirelativistic DFT calculations reveal a very strong g&#8208;tensor anisotropy, supporting the pe structure for the S and Se derivatives.

         <title>Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling of Aliphatic Amines with Alkylboronic Esters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the Cu&#8208;catalysed coupling of alkylboronic esters and aliphatic amines. This mild method is functional group tolerant, and uses O2 from air as the terminal oxidant. Investigation into the mechanism suggest that the boronic ester reacts with an aminyl radical, formed in&#8197;situ, to generate an alkyl radical intermediate.







Abstract
We report a Cu&#8208;catalyzed oxidative coupling of aliphatic amines with benzylic and aliphatic boronic esters to give high value alkyl amines, products found widely in applications from medicinal chemistry to materials science. This operationally simple reaction, which can be performed on gram scale, runs under mild conditions and exhibits broad functional group tolerance. The terminal oxidant of the reaction is O2 from the air, avoiding the need for additional chemical oxidants. Investigation into the reaction mechanism suggests that the boronic ester is activated by an aminyl radical, formed through oxidation of the amine by the Cu catalyst, to give a key alkyl radical intermediate. To demonstrate its utility and potential for late&#8208;stage functionalization, we showcase the method as the final step in the total synthesis of a TRPV1 antagonist.

         <title>Synthesis of Chiral Sulfoxides by A Cyclic Oxidation&#8208;Reduction Multi&#8208;Enzymatic Cascade Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unconventional biocatalytic oxidation&#8208;reduction cascade system with cofactor regeneration was established for the synthesis of enantiopure sulfoxides using prochiral sulfildes as substrates. Heteroaryl alkyl, aryl alkyl and dialkyl sulfoxides in R configuration were prepared in &gt;90&#8201;% conversion with &gt;90&#8201;% ee through the cascade catalysis of MsrA, Fus&#8208;SMO and three other auxiliary enzymes (Trx, Trx&#8208;R, and GDH).

Optically pure sulfoxides are valuable organosulfur compounds extensively employed in medicinal and organic synthesis. In this study, we present a biocatalytic oxidation&#8208;reduction cascade system designed for the preparation of enantiopure sulfoxides. The system involves the cooperation of a low&#8208;enantioselective chimeric oxidase SMO (styrene monooxygenase) with a high&#8208;enantioselective reductase MsrA (methionine sulfoxide reductase A), facilitating &#8220;non&#8208;selective oxidation and selective reduction&#8221; cycles for prochiral sulfide oxidation. The regeneration of requisite cofactors for MsrA and SMO was achieved via a cascade catalysis process involving three auxiliary enzymes, sustained by cost&#8208;effective D&#8208;glucose. Under the optimal reaction conditions, a series of heteroaryl alkyl, aryl alkyl and dialkyl sulfoxides in R configuration were synthesized through this &#8220;one&#8208;pot, one step&#8221; cascade reaction. The obtained compounds exhibited high yields of &gt;90&#8201;% and demonstrated enantiomeric excess (ee) values exceeding 90&#8201;%. This study represents an unconventional and efficient biocatalytic way in utilizing the low&#8208;enantioselective oxidase for the synthesis of enantiopure sulfoxides.

         <title>Solvent Geometry Regulated J&#8208; and H&#8208;Type Aggregates of Photoswitchable Organogelator: Phase&#8208;Selective Thixotropic Gelation and Oil Spill Recovery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we demonstrated solvent geometry regulated J and H&#8208;type of aggregates of an azobenzene containing photo switchable organogelator (AZO&#8208;4). The supramolecular polymerization of AZO&#8208;4 leads to formation of 1D&#8208;nanofiber, which transforms into small length nanofiber upon UV irradiation due to trans&#8208;to&#8208;cis isomerization. This can gelate various hydrocarbon solvent and oil, thus can be used for oil spill recovery applications.







Abstract
We demonstrate supramolecular polymerization and formation of 1D nanofiber of azobenzene based organogelator (AZO&#8208;4) in cyclic hydrocarbon solvents (toluene and methylcyclohexane). The AZO&#8208;4 exhibits J&#8208; and H&#8208;type aggregates in toluene: MCH (9&#8201;:&#8201;1) and MCH: toluene (9&#8201;:&#8201;1) respectively. The type of aggregate was governed by the geometry of the solvents used in the self&#8208;assembly process. The J&#8208;type aggregates with high thermal stability in toluene is due to the enhanced interaction of AZO&#8208;4 &#960;&#8208; surface with the toluene &#960;&#8208;surface, whereas H&#8208;aggregate with moderate thermal stability in MCH was due to the interruption of the cyclic hydrocarbon in van der Waals interactions of peripheral chains of AZO&#8208;4 molecule. The light induced reversible photoisomerization is observed for both J&#8208; and H&#8208;aggregates. The macroscopic property revealed spontaneous and strong gelation in toluene preferably due to the strong interactions of the AZO&#8208;4 nanofibers with the toluene solvent molecules compared to the MCH. The rheological measurements revealed thixotropic nature of the gels by step&#8208;strain experiments at room temperature. The thermodynamic parameter (&#916;Hm) of gel&#8208;to&#8208;sol transition was determined for all the gels to get more insight into the gelation property. Furthermore, the phase selective gelation property was extended to the oil spill recovery application using diesel/water and petrol/water mixture.

&lt;p&gt;Here we demonstrated solvent geometry regulated J and H-type of aggregates of an azobenzene containing photo switchable organogelator (AZO-4). The supramolecular polymerization of AZO-4 leads to formation of 1D-nanofiber, which transforms into small length nanofiber upon UV irradiation due to &lt;i&gt;trans-to-cis&lt;/i&gt; isomerization.

         <title>Is Simultaneous Binding to DNA and Gyrase Important for the Antibacterial Activity of Cystobactamids?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How do they bind ? New cystobactamid derivatives with duplicated triarene unit served to elucidate their bent shape conformation (CX&#8208;CY&#8208;CZ angle of ~110 degrees) by NMR analysis. Elongation of the triarene unit of cystobactamids lead to increased DNA binding affinity implying that they exert their inhibitory activity by interaction with the gyrase itself as well as with DNA via their triarene unit.







Abstract
Cystobactamids are aromatic oligoamides that exert their natural antibacterial properties by inhibition of bacterial gyrases. Such aromatic oligoamides were proposed to inhibit &#945;&#8208;helix&#8208;mediated protein&#8208;protein interactions and may serve for specific recognition of DNA. Based on this suggestion, we designed new derivatives that have duplicated cystobactamid triarene units as model systems to decipher the specific binding mode of cystobactamids to double stranded DNA. Solution NMR analyses revealed that natural cystobactamids as well as their elongated analogues show an overall bent shape at their central aliphatic unit, with an average CX&#8208;CY&#8208;CZ angle of ~110 degrees. Our finding is corroborated by the target&#8208;bound structure of close analogues, as established by cryo&#8208;EM very recently. Cystobactamid CN&#8208;861&#8208;2 binds directly to the bacterial gyrase with an affinity of 9 &#956;M, and also exhibits DNA&#8208;binding properties with specificity for AT&#8208;rich DNA. Elongation/dimerization of the triarene subunit of native cystobactamids is demonstrated to lead to an increase in DNA binding affinity. This implies that cystobactamids&#8217; gyrase inhibitory activity necessitates not just interaction with the gyrase itself, but also with DNA via their triarene unit.

In&#8208;cell 19F&#8197;NMR methodology has been proved as a practical tool for investigating the conformations, dynamics and interactions of biomacromolecules. Herein, we review its unique benefits, recent progress of sample preparation and application in this field. Based on their in&#8208;vitro and in&#8208;vivo studies, we also provide the future directions and outlook.







Abstract
In vitro, 19F&#8197;NMR methodology is preferably selected as a complementary and straightforward method for unveiling the conformations, dynamics, and interactions of biological molecules. Its effectiveness in&#8197;vivo has seen continuous improvement, addressing challenges faced by conventional heteronuclear NMR experiments on structured proteins, such as severe line broadening, low signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, and background signals. Herein, we summarize the distinctive advantages of 19F&#8197;NMR, along with recent progress in sample preparation and applications within the realm of in&#8208;cell NMR. Additionally, we offer insights into the future directions and prospects of this methodology based on our understanding.

         <title>5&#8208;Hydroxypyrroloindoline Affords Tryptathionine and 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bis&#8208;Indole Peptide Staples: Application to Melanotan&#8208;II</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optionality for Indole&#8208;based Peptide Stapling: hydroxypyrroloindoline, used regularly in reaction with cysteine to form a tryptathionine (Ttn) staple is found to react competitively with an indole to form a 2&#8217;2&#8217;&#8208;bis&#8208;indole tether (BITe). Judicious choice of protecting groups provides for chemoselectivity for optionality in terms of which staple is formed. Both staples are featured on a melanocortin peptide macrocycle and show nanomolar dissociation constants.







Abstract
With peptides increasingly favored as drugs, natural product motifs, namely the tryptathionine staple, found in amatoxins and phallotoxins, and the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bis&#8208;indole found in staurosporine represent unexplored staples for unnatural peptide macrocycles. We disclose the efficient condensation of a 5&#8208;hydroxypyrroloindoline with either a cysteine&#8208;thiol or a tryptophan&#8208;indole to form a tryptathionine or 2&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;bis&#8208;indole staple. Judicious use of protecting groups provides for chemoselective stapling using &#945;&#8208;MSH, which provides a basis for investigating both chemoselectivity and affinity. Both classes of stapled peptides show nanomolar Ki&#8217;s, with one showing a sub&#8208;nanomolar Ki value.

         <title>Carbon quantum dots modified and Y3+ doped Ni3(NO3)2(OH)4 nanospheres with excellent battery&#8208;like supercapacitor performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NiY@CQDs electrode materials prepared by a hydrothermal method have an excellent electrochemical property with a mass&#8208;specific capacitance of 2,944&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. The NiY@CQDs//AC asymmetric supercapacitors can reach an energy density of 138.65&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a high power density of 1,500&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1.







Abstract
Supercapacitor is an important energy storage device widely used in the automobile industry, military production, and communication equipment because of its fast charge&#8208;discharge rate, and high power density. Herein, carbon quantum dots modified and Y3+ doped Ni3(NO3)2(OH)4 (NiY@CQDs) nanospheres are prepared by a solvothermal method and used as an electrode material. The electrochemical properties of NiY@CQDs were measured in a three&#8208;electrode system. An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) cell was assembled with activated carbon (AC) as the anode and NiY@CQDs as the cathode. The electrochemical properties of the ASC device were measured in a two&#8208;electrode system. Experimental results show the shape of NiY@CQDs is petal&#8208;shaped and the introducing carbon quantum dots and doping Y3+ significantly increases the specific surface area, conductivity, and specific capacitance of Ni3(NO3)2(OH)4. The mass&#8208;specific capacitance of NiY@CQDs reaches up to 2944&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. The asymmetric supercapacitor of NiY@CQDs//AC has a high energy density of 138.65&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 1500&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1, displaying a wide range of application prospects in the energy storage area.

         <title>Central Ring Puckering Enhances the Stokes Shift of Xanthene Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Central ring puckering of xanthene dyes leads to a substantial increase of their Stokes shift. This puckering can be induced in xanthene dyes by introducing sp3 hybridized bridging groups into their scaffold. The Stokes shift can be fine&#8208;tuned by the steric hindrance of the bridging group. Herein, we introduce this concept as a novel general strategy for fluorescent dyes design.







Abstract
Small&#8208;molecule dyes are generally designed based on well&#8208;understood electronic effects. However, steric hindrance can promote excited&#8208;state geometric relaxation, increasing the difference between the positions of absorption and emission bands (the Stokes shift). Accordingly, we hypothesized that sterically induced central ring puckering in xanthene dyes could be used to systematically increase their Stokes shift. Through a combined experimental/quantum&#8208;chemical approach, we screened a group of (9&#8208;acylimino)&#8208;pyronin dyes with a perturbed central ring geometry. Our results showed that an atom with sp3 hybridization in position 10 of (9&#8208;acylimino)&#8208;pyronins induces central ring puckering and facilitates excited&#8208;state geometric relaxation, thereby markedly enhancing their Stokes shifts (by up to ~2000&#8197;cm&#8722;1). Thus, we prepared fluorescent (9&#8208;acylimino)&#8208;pyronin pH sensors, which showed a Stokes shift disparity between acid and base forms of up to ~8700&#8197;cm&#8722;1. Moreover, the concept of ring puckering&#8208;enhanced Stokes shift can be applied to a wide range of xanthene analogues found in the literature. Therefore, central ring puckering may be reliably used as a strategy for enhancing Stokes shifts in the rational design of dyes.

         <title>Sniffing Out the Sustainable Future: The Renewability Revolution in Fragrance Chemistry**</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this review, the impact of the transition from today&#8217;s petrochemical economy towards a 100/100 renewable and biodegradable future is discussed: &#8220;citrus&#8221;, &#8220;green&#8221;, &#8220;fruity&#8221;, &#8220;floral&#8221;, &#8220;floriental&#8221;, &#8220;oriental&#8221;, &#8220;woody&#8221;, &#8220;chypre&#8221; and &#8220;foug&#232;re&#8221;. After benchmark data on ingredients usage, definitions on biodegradation and sustainability are given. Celebrating the 150th anniversary of svanillin, its historic synthesis from renewable starting materials serves as introduction. Citrus scents upcycled from the beverages industry are already an ideal case for 100/100 with new opportunities for artificial essential oils. In the fruity domain, transparent and lactonic ingredients are available in a sustainable manner. In the domain of green odorants, there is a lack of green chemistry for important key materials. In the floral family, renewability is more critical than biodegradability, but cost is an issue. Thanks to Ambrox and maltol, florientals and orientals will persist, while woody notes severely lack an Iso E Super replacer. In the chypre genre, patchouli became the new moss, but more musks are increasingly in demand. With their high percentage of linalool and dihydromyrcenol, the construction of foug&#232;res could well become a precedent for other families, despite challenges in vetiver and salicylates. Still, the challenges exemplified create immense opportunities for new perfumery materials</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into Sc(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Homologation of Ketones with Diazo Compounds: How Trans Influence Assists in Controlling Stereochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric one&#8208;carbon homologation or ring expansion of ketones with formal insertion of carbene intermediate, is a challenging but useful strategy to construct a complex skeleton. Sc(III) and chiral ligands have been employed in this regard. However, due to flexible conformations and a variety of stereo models, the origin of stereochemistry remains ambiguous. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to explore the interactions that control the stereoselectivity of a Sc(III)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric homologation. The trans influence of counterions was found to affect the coordination mode of ketone to Sc(III), and consequently affect the stereoselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Evolution of a Combined UV/Vis and NMR Setup with Fixed Pathlengths for Mass&#8208;limited Samples</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The investigation of reaction mechanisms is a complex task that usually requires the use of several techniques. To obtain as much information as possible on the reaction and any intermediates &#8208; possibly invisible to one technique &#8208; the combination of techniques is a solution. In this work we present a new setup for combined UV/Vis and NMR spectroscopy and compare it to an established alternative. The presented approach allows a versatile usage of different commercially&#8208;available components like mirrors and fiber bundles as well as different fixed pathlengths according to double transmission or single transmission measurements. While a previous approach is based on a dip&#8208;probe setup for conventional NMR probes, the new one is based on a micro&#8208;Helmholtz coil array (LiquidVoxel&#8482;). This makes the use of rectangular cuvettes possible, which ensure well&#8208;defined pathlengths allowing for quantification of species. Additionally, very low quantities of compound can be analyzed due to the microfabrication and small cuvette size used. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle this new setup for combined UV/Vis and NMR spectroscopy is used to examine a well&#8208;studied photochromic system of the dithienylethene compound class. A thorough comparison of the pros and cons of the two setups for combined UV/Vis and NMR measurements is performed.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of Pyridothiophene Compounds for PET Imaging of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aggregated &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;&#8208;syn) protein is a pathological hallmark of Parkinson&#8217;s disease (PD) and Lewy body dementia (LBD). Development of positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers to image &#945;&#8208;syn aggregates has been a longstanding goal.&#160; We the pyridothiophene scaffold for &#945;&#8208;syn PET radiotracers, where 47 derivatives of a potent pyridothiophene (asyn&#8208;44; Kd = 1.85 nM) were synthesized and screened against [3H]asyn&#8208;44 in competitive binding assays using post&#8208;mortem PD brain homogenates. Equilibrium inhibition constant (Ki) values of the most potent compounds were determined, of which three had Ki's between 12&#8208;15 nM. An autoradiography study confirmed that [3H]asyn&#8208;44 is promising for imaging&#160; multiple system atrophy and PD. Fluorine&#8208;18 labelled asyn&#8208;44 was synthesized in 6&#177;2% radiochemical yield (decay&#8208;corrected, n=5) with a molar activity of 263&#177;121 GBq/&#181;mol. Preliminary PET imaging of [18F]asyn&#8208;44 in rats showed high initial brain uptake (&gt;1.5 standardized uptake value (SUV)), moderate washout (~0.4 SUV at 60 min), and low variability. Radiometabolite analysis showed 60&#8208;80% parent tracer in the brain after 30 and 60 mins. While [18F]asyn&#8208;44 displayed good in vitro properties and acceptable brain uptake, troublesome radiometabolites precluded further PET imaging studies. The development of additional pyridothiophene derivatives are underway, with the goal of attaining improved affinity and metabolic stability.</dc:description>

         <title>TS&#8208;1@MCM&#8208;48 Core&#8208;Shell Catalysts for Efficient Oxidation of p&#8208;Diethylbenzene to High Value&#8208;Added Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TS&#8208;1@MCM&#8208;48 zeolite with core&#8208;shell structure was synthesized and used in the catalytic oxidation of p&#8208;diethylbenzene. The reaction conditions and the oxidation mechanism of p&#8208;diethylbenzene were determined. The synergistic effect of core&#8208;shell zeolite improves the oxidation activity of p&#8208;diethylbenzene, and improves the selectivity of products while taking into account the selectivity of raw materials.







Abstract
To expand the market capacity of p&#8208;diethylbenzene (PDEB), core&#8208;shell zeolite (TS&#8208;1@MCM&#8208;48) is designed as a catalyst for PDEB oxidation. TS&#8208;1@MCM&#8208;48 catalyst is synthesized by in&#8208;situ crystallization method and characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), N2 adsorption&#8208;desorption, in&#8208;situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and 29Si nuclear magnetic resonance (29Si MAS&#8208;NMR). Oxidation of PDEB by H2O2 was investigated systematically in liquid phase. The conversion of PDEB over TS&#8208;1@MCM&#8208;48 was 28.1&#8201;% and the total selectivity was 72.6&#8201;%, where the selectivity of EAP (p&#8208;ethylacetophenone) and EPEA (4&#8208;ethyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;methylbenzyl alcohol) was 28.6&#8201;% and 44.0&#8201;%, respectively. Compared with TS&#8208;1 and MCM&#8208;48 zeolite, the conversion rate of reactants and the selectivity of products have been significantly improved. The catalytic performance of TS&#8208;1@MCM&#8208;48 is derived from its well&#8208;crystallized microporous core and mesoporous shell with regular channels, which make active sites of TS&#8208;1 zeolite in the catalyst be fully utilized and mass transfer resistance be largely reduced. Further through theoretical calculation, we propose that the oxidation of PDEB is the result of the combination and mutual transformation of free radical process and carbocation process. Core&#8208;shell structure ensures the conversion rate of raw materials and improves the selectivity of products.

         <title>Monomeric gold hydrides for carbon dioxide reduction: ligand effect on the reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism for the reaction of gold(I) hydrides with carbon dioxide was elucidated, revealing a one&#8211;step concerted mechanism leading to the formation of a formate product. A comparative ligand screening suggests that anionic/zwitterionic ligands should be employed experimentally for a successful implementation of a stoichiometric or catalytic reaction at the Au(I)&#8722;H site.







Abstract
We analyzed the ligand electronic effect in the reaction between a [LAu(I)H]0/&#8722; hydride species and CO2, leading to a coordinated formate [LAu(HCOO)]0/&#8722;. We explored 20&#8197;different ligands, such as carbenes, phosphines and others, carefully selected to cover a wide range of electron&#8208;donor and &#8208;acceptor properties. We included in the study the only ligand, an NHC&#8208;coordinated diphosphene, that, thus far, experimentally demonstrated facile and reversible reaction between the monomeric gold(I) hydride and carbon dioxide. We elucidated the previously unknown reaction mechanism, which resulted to be concerted and common to all the ligands: the gold&#8211;hydrogen bond attacks the carbon atom of CO2 with one oxygen atom coordinating to the gold center. A correlation between the ligand &#963; donor ability, which affects the electron density at the reactive site, and the kinetic activation barriers of the reaction has been found. This systematic study offers useful guidelines for the rational design of new ligands for this reaction, while suggesting a few promising and experimentally accessible potential candidates for the stoichiometric or catalytic CO2 activation.

         <title>Immobilised Ruthenium Complexes for the Electrooxidation of5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular catalysts immobilised on mesoporous indium tin oxide (meso&#8208;ITO) electrodes are shown to be a promising candidate for the electrooxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). The reactions proceed in acidic aqueous media to prevent competing substrate decomposition.







Abstract
Abundantly available biomass&#8208;based platform chemicals, including 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), are essential stepping stones in steering the chemical industry away from fossil fuels. The efficient catalytic oxidation of HMF to its diacid derivative, 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), is a promising research area with potential applications in the polymer industry. Currently, the most encouraging approaches are based on solid&#8208;state catalysts and are often conducted in basic aqueous media, conditions where HMF oxidation competes with its decomposition. Efficient molecular catalysts are practically unknown for this reaction. In this study, we report on the synthesis and electrocatalysis of surface&#8208;bound molecular ruthenium complexes for the transformation of HMF to FDCA under acidic conditions. Catalyst immobilisation on mesoporous indium tin oxide electrodes is achieved through the incorporation of phosphonic acid anchoring groups. Screening experiments with HMF and further reaction intermediates revealed the catalytic route and bottlenecks in the catalytic synthesis of FDCA. Utilising these immobilised electrocatalysts, FDCA yields of up to 85&#8201;% and faradaic efficiencies of 91&#8201;% were achieved, without any indication of substrate decomposition. Surface analysis by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) post&#8208;electrocatalysis unveiled the desorption of the catalyst from the electrode surface as a limiting factor in terms of catalytic performance.

         <title>Focused Ultrasound&#8208;Responsive Nanocomposite with Near&#8208;Infrared II Mechanoluminescence for Spatiotemporally Selective Immune Activation in Lymph Nodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Focused ultrasound responsive immunomodulator&#8208;loaded nanomaterial (FURIN) for spatiotemporally controllable immune activation in the lymphatic system in&#8197;vivo. FURIN could be enriched in the lymph node (LN) of mice via subcutaneous injection and the mechanoluminescence (ML) of FURIN in the near&#8208;infrared region enables real&#8208;time, visualized feedback of FUS by bioimaging. FUS with high precision and deep penetration can activate dendritic cells (DCs) in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
The immune regulation of the lymphatic system, especially the lymph node (LN), is of great significance for the treatment of diseases and the inhibition of pathogenic organisms spreading in the body. However, achieving precise spatiotemporal control of immune cell activation in LN in&#8197;vivo remains a challenge due to tissue depth and off&#8208;target effects. Furthermore, minimally invasive and real&#8208;time feedback methods to monitor the regulation of the immune system in LN are lacking. Here, focused ultrasound responsive immunomodulator loaded nanoplatform (FURIN) with near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) luminescence is designed to achieve spatiotemporally controllable immune activation in LN in&#8197;vivo. The NIR&#8208;II persistent luminescence of FURIN can track its delivery in LN through bioimaging. Under focused ultrasound (FUS) stimulation, the immunomodulator encapsulated in FURIN can be released locally in the LN to activate immune cells such as dendritic cells and the NIR&#8208;II mechanoluminescence of FURIN provides real&#8208;time optical feedback signals for immune activation. This work points to a FUS mediated, spatiotemporal selective immune activation strategy in&#8197;vivo with the feedback control of luminescence signals via ultrasound responsive nanocomposite, which is of great significance in improving the efficacy and reducing the side effect of immune regulation for the development of potential immunotherapeutic methods in the future.

     alt="Focused Ultrasound-Responsive Nanocomposite with Near-Infrared II Mechanoluminescence for Spatiotemporally Selective Immune Activation in Lymph Nodes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focused ultrasound responsive immunomodulator-loaded nanomaterial (FURIN) for spatiotemporally controllable immune activation in the lymphatic system in&#8197;vivo. FURIN could be enriched in the lymph node (LN) of mice via subcutaneous injection and the mechanoluminescence (ML) of FURIN in the near-infrared region enables real-time, visualized feedback of FUS by bioimaging. FUS with high precision and deep penetration can activate dendritic cells (DCs) in&#8197;vivo.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The immune regulation of the lymphatic system, especially the lymph node (LN), is of great significance for the treatment of diseases and the inhibition of pathogenic organisms spreading in the body. However, achieving precise spatiotemporal control of immune cell activation in LN &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vivo&lt;/i&gt; remains a challenge due to tissue depth and off-target effects. Furthermore, minimally invasive and real-time feedback methods to monitor the regulation of the immune system in LN are lacking. Here, focused ultrasound responsive immunomodulator loaded nanoplatform (FURIN) with near-infrared II (NIR-II) luminescence is designed to achieve spatiotemporally controllable immune activation in LN &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vivo&lt;/i&gt;. The NIR-II persistent luminescence of FURIN can track its delivery in LN through bioimaging. Under focused ultrasound (FUS) stimulation, the immunomodulator encapsulated in FURIN can be released locally in the LN to activate immune cells such as dendritic cells and the NIR-II mechanoluminescence of FURIN provides real-time optical feedback signals for immune activation. This work points to a FUS mediated, spatiotemporal selective immune activation strategy &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vivo&lt;/i&gt; with the feedback control of luminescence signals via ultrasound responsive nanocomposite, which is of great significance in improving the efficacy and reducing the side effect of immune regulation for the development of potential immunotherapeutic methods in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chalcogen Atom Size: A Key Parameter in Modulating Carbonyl Compound Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;functional group! Replacing oxygen in a carbonyl functional group for the larger, but less electronegative chalcogens, sulfur or selenium, unexpectedly enhances the C=X group electronegativity in &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules and reduces the molecular &#960;HOMO&#8211;&#960;LUMO gap. This tunability of the properties of carbonyl compounds holds applications in many fields of chemistry, including supramolecular chemistry, organocatalysis, and photo(electro)chemistry.







Abstract
Exchanging oxygen in the functional group C=O (i.&#8201;e., carbonyl) for the less electronegative Group 16 elements, sulfur or selenium, unexpectedly enhances the electronegativity of the C=X group in &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules and reduces the molecular &#960; HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap. Quantum&#8208;chemical analyses revealed that the steric size of the chalcogen atom X is at the origin of this seemingly counterintuitive behavior. This tuning of the chemical properties of carbonyl compounds by varying the chalcogen atom size in the C=X bond can be applied in many fields of chemistry. This concept article delineates several useful applications in the fields of organocatalysis, supramolecular chemistry, and photo(electro)chemistry.

         <title>Boron&#8208; and Oxygen&#8208;Doped &#960;&#8208;Extended Helical Nanographene with Circularly Polarised Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence</title>

         <dc:description>
B, O&#8208;doped &#960;&#8208;extended helical nanographene has been explored for its optical and chiroptical properties. The presence of helical and nanographene segments stabilize the helicity and imparts tunable optical properties. Helical nanographene display circularly polarized thermally activated delayed fluorescence.







Abstract
Helical nanographenes have garnered substantial attention owing to their finely adjustable optical and semiconducting properties. The strategic integration of both helicity and heteroatoms into the nanographene structure, facilitated by a boron&#8208;oxygen&#8208;based multiple resonance (MR) thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), elevates its photophysical and chiroptical features. This signifies the introduction of an elegant category of helical nanographene that combines optical (TADF) and chiroptical (CPL) features. In this direction, we report the synthesis, optical, and chiroptical properties of boron, oxygen&#8208;doped &#928;&#8208;extended helical nanographene. The &#960;&#8208;extension induces distortion in the DOBNA&#8208;incorporated nanographene, endowing a pair of helicenes, (P)&#8208;B2NG, and (M)&#8208;B2NG exhibiting circularly polarized luminescence with glum of &#8722;2.3&#215;10&#8722;3 and +2.5&#215;10&#8722;3, respectively. B2NG exhibited MR&#8208;TADF with a lifetime below 5 &#956;s, and a reasonably high fluorescence quantum yield (50&#8201;%). Our molecular design enriches the optical and chiroptical properties of nanographenes and opens up new opportunities in multidisciplinary fields.

         <title>Impact of Endcap Molecules on Temperature&#8208;Responsive Cholesteric Liquid Crystal Oligomers in Structural Color Stability and Hypsochromic Shift</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Temperature&#8208;responsive structurally colored coatings are created using endcapped cholesteric liquid crystal oligomers. Newly synthesized and commercially available endcapping molecules are employed to terminate the liquid crystal oligomers. The impact of the endcap molecules in the oligomers on structural color stability and hypsochromic shift was studied. Commercial endcapping molecules were found to produce unstable coatings, while the new endcapped molecules led to stable coatings with reversible thermochromic behavior, making them intriguing for advanced optical applications.







Abstract
Cholesteric liquid crystal oligomers are an interesting class of temperature responsive structurally colored materials. However, the role of endcap molecules in these oligomers is rather unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate the role of endcap molecules on structural color stability and hypsochromic shift in temperature&#8208;responsive cholesteric liquid crystal oligomers. First, new liquid crystal monoacrylate endcap molecules are synthesized, which are then used to synthesize various cholesteric liquid crystal oligomers. In addition, cholesteric oligomers using commercial monoacrylate endcap molecules are also prepared. It is found that the molecular weight and the polydispersity of the oligomers can be tuned by the endcapping molecules. The oligomers are used to produce reflective, structurally colored coatings. It was found that the coatings using the commercial monoacrylate lose their color and crystallize over time, most likely due to the presence of crystalline dimers. The coatings containing the newly synthesized monoacrylate endcap molecules did not exhibit this crystallization, resulting in structurally colored coatings that remained stable over time. These latter coatings possessed temperature responsive hypochromic behavior, which makes them interesting for advanced optical applications.

         <title>Bi(III) Binding Stoichiometry and Domain&#8208;Specificity Differences Between Apo and Zn(II)&#8208;bound Metallothionein 1a</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bismuth is a xenobiotic metal with a high affinity to sulfur that is used in a variety of therapeutic applications. Bi(III) induces the cysteine&#8208;rich metallothionein (MT), a protein known to form two&#8208;domain cluster structures with certain metals such as Zn(II), Cd(II), or Cu(I). The binding of Bi(III) to MTs has been previously studied, but there are conflicting reports on the stoichiometry and binding pathway, which appear to be highly dependent on pH and initial metal&#8208;loading status of the MT. Additionally, domain specificity has not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, ESI&#8208;MS was used to determine the binding constants of [Bi(EDTA)]&#8208; binding to apo&#8208;MT1a and its individual &#945;MT fragment. The results were compared to previous experiments using &#946;MT1a and &#946;&#945;MT3. Domain specificity was investigated using proteolysis methods and the initial cooperatively formed Bi2MT was found to bind to cysteines that spanned across the traditional metal binding domain regions. Titrations of [Bi(EDTA)]&#8208; into Zn7MT were performed and were found to result in a maximum stoichiometry of Bi7MT, contrasting the Bi6MT formed when [Bi(EDTA)]&#8208; was added to apo&#8208;MT. These results show that the initial structure of the apo&#8208;MT determines the stoichiometry of new incoming metals and explains the previously observed differences in stoichiometry.</dc:description>

Domain specificity was investigated using proteolysis methods and the initial cooperatively formed Bi2MT was found to bind to cysteines that spanned across the traditional metal binding domain regions. Titrations of [Bi(EDTA)]- into Zn7MT were performed and were found to result in a maximum stoichiometry of Bi7MT, contrasting the Bi6MT formed when [Bi(EDTA)]- was added to apo-MT. These results show that the initial structure of the apo-MT determines the stoichiometry of new incoming metals and explains the previously observed differences in stoichiometry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Detecting protein&#8208;ligand interactions with nitroxide based paramagnetic cosolutes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An easy&#8208;to&#8208;use NMR method for studying protein&#8208;ligand interactions is presented, relying on the measurement of paramagnetic relaxation enhancements induced by soluble nitroxide molecules. The NMR method can be useful for detecting changes of the electrostatic potential of proteins triggered by ligand binding and for detecting the location of ligand binding sites.







Abstract
NMR spectroscopy techniques can provide important information about protein&#8208;ligand interactions. Here we tested an NMR approach which relies on the measurement of paramagnetic relaxation enhancements (PREs) arising from analogous cationic, anionic or neutral soluble nitroxide molecules, which distribute around the protein&#8208;ligand complex depending on near&#8208;surface electrostatic potentials. We applied this approach to two protein&#8208;ligand systems, interleukin&#8208;8 interacting with highly charged glycosaminoglycans and the SH2 domain of Grb2 interacting with less charged phospho&#8208;tyrosine tripeptides. The electrostatic potential around interleukin&#8208;8 and its changes upon binding of glycosaminoglycans could be derived from the PRE data and confirmed by theoretical predictions from Poisson&#8208;Boltzmann calculations. The ligand influence on the PREs and NMR&#8208;derived electrostatic potentials of Grb2 SH2 was localized to a narrow protein region which allowed the localization of the peptide binding pocket. Our analysis suggests that experiments with nitroxide cosolutes can be useful for investigating protein&#8208;ligand electrostatic interactions and mapping ligand binding sites.

         <title>Energy Transfer on Cytoskeleton of Red Blood Cell Ghosts and their Efficiency Control by KCl Concentration&#8208;induced Cell Shrinkage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Red blood cell ghosts (RBCGs), in which donor and acceptor molecules were chemically conjugated to a cytoskeleton network located beneath the inner membrane, exhibited energy transfer. Their efficiency varied depending on the amount and ratio of donor and acceptor modifications, as confirmed by experimental and theoretical analysis. Furthermore, the KCl concentration&#8208;induced RBCG shrinkage enhanced the energy transfer efficiency.







Abstract
Lipid bilayer membranes such as liposomes have been utilized as platforms for bioinspired artificial photosynthesis. Embedding functional compounds, including chromophores and catalysts, into two&#8208;dimensional lipid membranes allows their high local concentration and proximity, resulting in enhanced reactivity compared to that of homogeneous solutions. The control of photoreactions by the physical and chemical properties of membranes, such as fluidity and phase separation, has also been well studied in recent years. In contrast, it remains difficult to control chemical reactions via dynamic membrane deformation. Here, we report on the control of excitation energy transfer using red blood cell ghosts (RBCGs) as scaffolds, relying on their asymmetric lipid membranes and inherent and unique deformability. RBCGs, in which donor and acceptor molecules were chemically conjugated to a two&#8208;dimensional cytoskeleton located beneath the inner membrane, exhibited energy transfer, and their efficiency varied depending on the amount and ratio of donor and acceptor modifications, as confirmed by experimental and theoretical analysis. Furthermore, the KCl concentration&#8208;induced RBCG shrinkage enhanced the energy transfer efficiency. Our proposed method is expected to facilitate the construction of photoreaction systems that can be controlled via membrane deformation.

         <title>Different Reaction Modes Operating in ansa&#8208;Half&#8208;Sandwich Magnesium Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Magnesium&#8208;based catalysts are becoming popular for hydroelementation reactions specially using p&#8208;block reagents. Based on the seminal report from Sch&#228;fer&#8217;s group (ChemCatChem 2022, 14, e202201007), our study demonstrates that the reaction mechanisms exhibit a far greater degree of complexity than originally presumed. Magnesium has a variety of coordination modes (and access to different hybridizations) which allows this electron&#8208;deficient centre to modulate its catalytic power depending on the &#963;&#8208;donor properties of the reagent. DFT calculations demonstrate several reaction channels closely operating in these versatile catalysts. In addition, variations in limiting energy barriers resulting from catalyst modifications were examined as a function of the Hammett constant, thereby predicting enhanced efficiency in reaction conversions.</dc:description>

         <title>Hypervalent Iodine Compounds in Carbohydrate Chemistry: Glycosylation, Functionalization and Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This mini review article provides an overview on the use of hypervalent iodine compounds (HICs) in carbohydrate synthesis, focusing on their chemistry and recent applications. HICs are similar to transition metals in their reactivity but have the added benefit of being environmentally benign, and are therefore commonly used as selective oxidants and eco&#8208;friendly reagents in organic synthesis. Herein, we summarize various synthetic uses of hypervalent iodine reagents in reactions such as glycosylation, oxidations, functionalization, and C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming reactions. The goal of this review is to illustrate the advantages and versatility of using HICs as an environmentally sustainable alternative to heavy metals in carbohydrate chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Gas Evolution as a Tool to Study Reaction Kinetics Under Biomimetic Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The field of bioorthogonal chemistry is rapidly growing, presenting successful applications of organic and transition metal catalysed reactions in cells and living systems (in vivo). The development of such reactions typically proceeds through many iterative steps focused on biocompatibility and fast reaction kinetics to ensure product formation. However, obtaining kinetic data, even under simulated biological (biomimetic) conditions, remains a challenge due to substantial concentrations of salts and biomolecules hampering the use of typically employed solution&#8208;phase analytical techniques. In this study, we explored the suitability of gas evolution as a probe to study kinetics under biomimetic conditions. As proof of concept, we show that the progress of two transition metal&#8208;catalysed bioorthogonal chemical reactions can be accurately monitored, regardless of the complexity of the medium. As such, we introduce a protocol to gain more insight into the performance of a catalytic system under biomimetic conditions to further progress iterative catalyst development for&#160;in vivo&#160;applications</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetranuclear cores (M&#8211;E)2 of transition metals (M) and tetrylenes (EII = Si, Ge, Sn) are key motifs in homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. They exhibit a continuum of M&#8211;M and E&#8211;E bonding within the inorganic core that leads to a variety of structures for which there are no specific synthetic methods. Herein, we report a series of highly reduced [Ni0GeII]2 squares solely stabilized by bulky terphenyl (C6H3&#8208;2,6&#8208;Ar2) ligands, for which we provide complementary and high&#8208;yielding syntheses. Reactivity studies with common Lewis bases (carbene and CO) evince that the structure of the (M&#8211;E)2 core can be finely tuned. We have investigated this core modification by computational means, offering a rationale to better understand the continuum of bonding across these clusters.</dc:description>

         <title>Caged Dexamethasone to Photo&#8208;control the Development of Embryos through Activation of the Glucocorticoid Receptor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient tools for controlling molecular functions with exquisite spatiotemporal resolution are much in demand to investigate biological processes in living systems. Here we report an easily synthesized caged dexamethasone for photo&#8208;activating cytoplasmic proteins fused to the glucocorticoid receptor. In the dark, it is stable in vitro as well as in vivo in both zebrafish (Danio rerio) and Xenopus sp, two significant models of vertebrates. In contrast, it liberates dexamethasone upon UV illumination, which has been harnessed to interfere with developmental steps in embryos of these animals. Interestingly, this new system is biologically orthogonal to the one for photo&#8208;activating proteins fused to the estrogen ERT receptor, which brings great prospect for activating two distinct proteins down to the single cell level.</dc:description>

         <title>Solution&#8208;Phase Late&#8208;Stage Chemoselective Photocatalytic Removal of Sulfonyl and Phenacyl Groups in Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, BPC catalyzed visible&#8208;light&#8208;triggered target&#8208;specific late&#8208;stage solution phase desulfonylation from tryptophan in oligopeptides is portrayed by overcoming the isolation issue up to octamers. This robust and mild method is highly predictable and chemoselective, tolerating myriad of functional groups in aza&#8208;heteroaromatics and peptides. Interestingly, reductive desulfonylation is also amenable to biologically significant reactive histidine and tyrosine side chains, signifying the versatility of the strategy. Additional efficacy of BPC is demonstrated by solution phase phenacyl deprotection from C&#8208;terminal in peptides. Furthermore, excellent catalyst loading of 0.5 mol% and recyclability demonstrate the practical utility and applicability of this strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>TiO2/Loofah&#8208;Halloysite Bio&#8208;Hybrid Composites as Efficient Systems for VOCs Removal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), recognized as hazardous air contaminants, prompt the exploration of sustainable air purification methods. Solar photocatalytic oxidation emerges as a promising solution, utilizing semiconductor photocatalysts like titanium dioxide (TiO2). However, the raw material crisis necessitates reduced TiO2 usage, leading to investigations into TiO2 modification techniques. The study introduces a novel approach by employing natural fibers, specifically loofah sponge, as a TiO2 support. This method aims to maintain photocatalytic activity while minimizing TiO2 content. The article explores using halloysite, a natural clay mineral, as a supportive material, enhancing mechanical strength and adsorption properties. The resulting TiO2/loofah&#8208;halloysite composites are evaluated for their efficacy in gas&#8208;phase photocatalytic oxidation of toluene and ethanol, chosen as representative VOCs. The conversion of toluene and ethanol on the composite was 88% and 39%, respectively, with high selectivity toward CO2. In addition to its high performance, the bio&#8208;composite was stable for several conversion cycles, keeping the conversion activity unchanged. The study contributes to developing green hybrid materials for VOC removal, showcasing potential applications across industries.</dc:description>

         <title>Interaction of the Immune System TIM&#8208;3 Protein with a Model Cellular Membrane Containing Phosphatidyl&#8208;Serine Lipids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>T cell transmembrane, Immunoglobulin, and Mucin (TIM) are important immune system proteins which are especially present in T&#8208;cells and regulated the immune system by sensing cell engulfment and apoptotic processes. Their role is exerted by the capacity to detect the presence of phosphatidyl&#8208;serine lipid polar head in the outer leaflet of cellular membranes (correlated with apoptosis). In this contribution by using equilibrium and enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulation we unravel the molecular bases and the thermodynamics of TIM, and in particular TIM&#8208;3, interaction with phosphatidyl serine in a lipid bilayer. Since TIM&#8208;3 deregulation is an important factor of pro&#8208;oncogenic tumor micro&#8208;environment understanding its functioning at a molecular level may pave the way to the development of original immunotherapeutic approaches.</dc:description>

         <title>Access to a peri&#8208;Annulated Aluminium Compound via C&#8211;H Bond Activation by a Cyclic Bis&#8208;Aluminylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbocyclic aluminium halides [(ADC)AlX2]2 (2&#8208;X) (X = F, Cl, and I) based on an anionic dicarbene (ADC = PhC{N(Dipp)C}2, Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) framework are prepared as crystalline solids by dehydrohalogenations of the alane [(ADC)AlH2]2 (1). KC8 reduction of 2&#8208;I affords the peri&#8208;annulated Al(III) compound [(ADCH)AlH]2 &#160;(4) (ADCH = PhC{N(Dipp)C2(DippH)N}, DippH = 2&#8208;iPr,6&#8208;(Me2C)C6H3)) as a colorless crystalline solid in 76% yield. The formation of 4 suggests intramolecular insertion of the putative bis&#8208;aluminylene species [(ADC)Al]2 (3) into the methine C&#8211;H bond of HCMe2 group. Calculations predict singlet ground state for 3, while the conversion of 3 into 4 is thermodynamically favored by 61 kcal/mol. Compounds 2&#8208;F, 2&#8208;Cl, 2&#8208;I, and 4 have been characterized by NMR spectroscopy and their solid&#8208;state molecular structures have been established by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regulation of fluorescence and self&#8208;assembly of a salicylaldehyde azine&#8208;containing amphiphile by a water&#8208;soluble pillar[5]arene via host&#8211;guest recognition in water was realized. The fluorescence and the self&#8208;assembled aggregates of the bola&#8208;type amphiphile G can be tailored by adding different amounts of water&#8208;soluble pillar[5]arene (WP5). In addition, the emission property and self&#8208;assembly behavior of G and WP5 are responsive to pH conditions. Furthermore, the fluorescence emission property of G and the regulation by WP5 or pH conditions was applied as information encryption material, rewritable paper, and erasable ink. We believe that this fluorescence regulation strategy is promising for the construction of advanced fluorescent organic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Bidentate Phosphines Enabled by Photoinduced Reductive Diphosphination of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The diphosphination of alkenes through a radical pathway offers a promising approach for the rapid construction of aryl bisphosphines. However, such a synthetic strategy has not been successfully applied to the preparation of alkyl bisphosphines, partially due to the difficulties in the generation of phosphorus&#8208;centered radicals from common alkyl phosphine compounds. We herein demonstrate that this challenge can be overcome by hiring Janus&#8208;faced chlorophosphine as the phosphine source that can act as not only a radical precursor to generate phosphine&#8208;centered radicals but also a radicalphile to capture alkyl radicals. With this novel strategy, a photocatalyzed reductive diphosphination reaction has been established, allowing for a straightforward synthesis of both aryl and alkyl 1,2&#8208;bisphosphines from readily accessible alkenes and chlorophosphines.</dc:description>

         <title>Electropolymerization of Preferred&#8208;Oriented Conjugated Microporous Polymer Films for Enhanced Fluorescent Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;quality conjugated microporous polymer (CMP) films with orientation and controlled structure are extremely desired for applications. Here, we report the effective construction of CMP 3D composite films (pZn/PTPCz) with a controlled porosity structure and preferred orientation using the template&#8208;assisted electropolymerization (EP) approach for the first time. The structure of pZn/PTPCz composite thin films and nitrophenol sensing performance were thoroughly studied. When compared to the control CMP film made on flat indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates, the as&#8208;prepared pZn/PTPCz composite films showed significantly enhanced fluorescent intensity and much better sensing performance for the model explosive. This was attributed to the metal&#8208;enhanced fluorescence (MEF) of porous nanostructured zinc (pZn) and the additional macroporosity of the pZn/PTPCz composite films. This work provides a feasible approach for creating oriented 3D CMP&#8208;based thin films for advanced applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Synthesis of B&#8592;N Adducts by the Amine&#8208;Facilitated Trimerization of the Phenylboronic Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stable boroxine&#8208;amine adducts comprising dative B&#8592;N bond(s) were prepared by mechanochemically&#8208;induced reactions of phenylboronic acid (PBA) and amines (pyridine, DMAP, 1H&#8208;pyrazole, piperidine, DABCO, hexamethylenetetramine, or 4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine). In&#8208;situ Raman monitoring, ex&#8208;situ PXRD and DFT calculations were used for product identification. Stoichiometry of the product (3:1, 3:2 or 6:1 adduct) was controlled by the amine structure and the molar ratio of the reactants. The 1:2 H&#8208;bonded assembly of PBA and 4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (bpy) was confirmed as an intermediate in the adduct formation for bpy. Competitive binding experiments indicated that the exchange of the amines in the 3:1 adducts follows the computed adduct stabilities that increase with the amine basicity. Following the DFT prediction, the first adduct with two different amines, DMAP and pip, bound to one boroxine moiety was isolated and structurally characterized. Results show that calculations can be used to predict possible and preferred product(s) and their spectral characteristics.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidation of Alcohols in Continuous Flow with a Solid Phase Hypervalent Iodine Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One of the most useful transformations in the synthetic chemist arsenal is the oxidation of alcohols to their corresponding carbonyl congeners. Despite its seemingly straightforward nature, this transformative reaction predominantly relies on the use of metals or hazardous reagents, making these processes highly unsustainable. To address this challenge, we have developed a sustainable metal&#8208;free method for the oxidation of alcohols in continuous flow. Using a solid phase hypervalent iodine catalyst and nBu4HSO5 as a phase transfer catalyst and co&#8208;oxidant, primary and secondary alcohols were selectively oxidized to the corresponding carbonyl motifs. This operationally simple continuous&#8208;flow set&#8208;up is highly robust (15 cycles run without significant catalyst leaching or loss of reaction efficiency), uses green solvents, such as acetonitrile or acetic acid, and is readily scalable.</dc:description>
