         <title>The Future is Bright: The Emergence of Glassy Organic Dots for Biological Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glassy organic dots (g&#8208;Odots) are an emerging class of luminescent nanoparticles that offer enhanced photostability, superior brightness, and modular tunability compared to other commonly employed nanoparticles. In the last several years, they have been used as bioimaging probes for single&#8208; and multi&#8208;photon cellular imaging, exhibiting low cytotoxicity even after several days. While they are emerging as promising materials for use in biological applications, g&#8208;Odots face several key challenges before their use can become widespread. In this concept, we outline the state of the literature on g&#8208;Odots and highlight a few ways in which their design and use can be improved upon.</dc:description>

         <title>Application of Advanced Microscopy Techniques to The Characterization of Mixed Matrix Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) have emerged as promising materials for various separation processes due to their tunable properties, enhanced separation performance and reproducibility. In this review paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the methodologies, challenges, and applications associated with the characterization of MMMs using two advanced imaging techniques: Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB&#8208;SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). We begin by outlining the principles and capabilities of FIB&#8208;SEM and TEM, emphasizing their suitability for studying the microstructure, morphology, and composition of MMMs at nanoscale resolution. Subsequently, we discuss the specific challenges and limitations encountered in the characterization of MMMs using these techniques, including sample preparation, image acquisition, and data interpretation. Furthermore, we review the diverse applications of FIB&#8208;SEM and TEM in elucidating the structure&#8208;property relationships of MMMs. Through illustrative examples, we highlight the valuable insights gained from these imaging techniques in optimizing MMMs for various separation applications. Finally, we propose future directions and emerging trends in MMM characterization, including the integration of lasers into FIB&#8208;SEM and in situ characterization techniques, to address current challenges and push the boundaries of MMM design and performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of a Fluorinated&#8208;Anion Pillared Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Exhibiting Dual&#8208;Pore Architecture for Simultaneous Enhancement of C2H2 Adsorption Capacity and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Physisorption&#8208;based separation processes represents a promising alternative to the conventional thermally driven methods, such as cryogenic separation. However, a significant challenge lies in balancing the trade&#8208;off between adsorption capacity and selectivity of adsorbents. In this study, we introduce a novel fluorinated&#8208;anion pillared metal&#8208;organic frameworks (APMOFs) featuring a dual&#8208;pore architecture, constructed using a pyridine&#8208;oxazole bifunctional ligand. The inherent low symmetry of the ligand leads to significant distortion of the fluorinated&#8208;anion pillars, resulting in a distinctive type of APMOFs characterized by dual&#8208;pore architecture. On pore structure with constrict pore width is enriched with a high density of anion fluorinated pillars, offering numerous active sites advantageous for enhancing separation selectivity. Concurrently, the other pore structure exhibits larger dimensions, facilitating increased gas molecule accommodation and thereby augmenting adsorption capacity. Gas sorption studies reveal a substantial C2H2 adsorption capacity and a high C2H2/CO2 separation selectivity. Breakthrough experiments confirm its exceptional separation performance, while theoretical investigations elucidate a sequential adsorption process within these APMOFs, underscoring the efficacy of this strategy in overcoming trade&#8208;off limits in adsorbents.</dc:description>

         <title>Osmapentalenofurans Constructed by Reacting Os&#8801;C1 of Osmapentalyne with Phenols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article presents the efficient synthesis of osmapentalenofurans via the reaction of osmapentalyne containing Os&#8801;C1 with phenols, resulting in complexes with near&#8208;infrared luminescence. The TPE&#8208;derived osmapentalenofuran showed remarkable AIE properties, expanding the reactivity of these compounds and highlighting their potential in specialized functional materials and advanced luminescent applications.







Abstract
Over the past decade, significant research efforts have focused on osmapentalyne, characterized by the more reactive Os&#8801;C7 (Carbon atoms numbered in a clockwise direction on the osmapentalyne skeleton), across areas encompassing electrophilic, nucleophilic, and addition reactions. Nevertheless, the reactivity of osmapentalyne featuring Os&#8801;C1 remains ripe for further exploration. In this investigation, we effectively synthesized a lineage of osmapentalenofurans through the nucleophilic reaction of osmapentalyne incorporating Os&#8801;C1 with phenols. These resulting complexes demonstrate near&#8208;infrared luminescence traits in both solid and liquid states. Particularly noteworthy is the osmapentalenofuran derived from tetraphenylethane (TPE) unit, which showcases remarkable aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) property in the aggregated state. These osmapentalenofurans are also able to further extend their range of reactions, including reactions with base and isonitrile. This study not only broadens the scope of applications for metal aromatics but also furnishes valuable insights into the realm of specialized functional materials.

         <title>Chiral Amphiphilic Au23 Cluster and Its Specific Recognition to Remote Di&#8208;amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydrophility, amphiphilicity, chirality, thermostability, luminescence intensity and circularly polarized luminescence properties of the [Au23(CHT)16]&#8722; has been greatly improved after incorporating the captopril ligands, which further endows the clusters with specific recognizing capacity to remote di&#8208;amine structures such as Arg, Cys, and DNA strands. Chiral Amphiphilic Au23 Cluster and Its Specific Recognition to Remote Di&#8208;amines.







Abstract
The atomic precision of metal nanoclusters and variability of surface ligands pave the way for their rational design and functionalization, whereas the property strengthening in multiple ways has been long challenging. Herein, improved amphiphilicity, chirality, thermostability, and strong CPL (circularly polarized luminescence) properties have been accomplished by facile ligand exchange of [Au23(CHT)16]&#8722; with HCapt (HCHT and HCapt denote cyclohexanethiol and captopril). In addition, the obtained chiral [Au23(SR)16]&#8722; (short for [Au23(CHT)16&#8208;x(Capt)x]&#8722;) clusters show specific binding affinity to remote&#8208;diamines (such as arginine and single/double strand DNA), originating from the hydrogen bonding and Van der Waals interaction among the surface Capt ligands and the di&#8208;amine groups.

         <title>Exohedral Diels&#8208;Alder Reactivity of Endohedral Metallofullerene C36</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 58, October 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preferential position of 3d metal atoms inside the C36 cage and their effect on exohedral Diels&#8208;Alder reactivity is reported in comparison with the empty C360 and C362&#8722; cages. Among all [5&#8208;5], [6&#8208;5] and [6 6] C&#8722;C bonds the [5&#8208;5] bond is the most reactive bond in both the empty C36 and metallofullerene M@C36.







Abstract
Understanding the exohedral reactivity of metallofullerenes is crucial for its application in various fields. By systematically controlling the trapped species inside the fullerene its reactivity can be tamed. In this work we report the preferential position of 3d metal atoms inside the C36 cage and their effect on exohedral reactivity in comparison with the neutral and the dianionic cage. The Diels&#8208;Alder (DA) reaction between butadiene and all non&#8208;equivalent [5&#8208;5], [6&#8208;5] and [6&#8208;6] C&#8722;C bonds on the fullerene cage was considered for the analysis, by using density functional theory at the S12g/TZ2P level including COSMO solvation model to elucidate the complete mechanistic pathways. Our results indicate that the preferential position of the metal ion is at the position close to the upper hexagon, and that the general trend in the reactivity of bonds follows the order [5&#8208;5]&gt;[6&#8208;5]&gt;[6&#8208;6]. Moreover, the encapsulation of metal atoms further enhances the reactivity of these bonds, by lowering the LUMOs of the cage, hence maximizing the orbital interactions.

         <title>Binary and Ternary Deep Eutectic Solvents for Methylene Green Electropolymerization on Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes: Optimization, Characterization and Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 58, October 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new ternary deep eutectic solvent is used for the electropolymerization of methylene green on carbon nanotube modified glassy carbon electrodes. Modified electrode characterization is by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and morphology by scanning electron microscopy. It is successfully used as a sensor for simultaneous determination of 5&#8208;aminosalicylic acid and acetaminophen in pharmaceutical samples by differential pulse voltammetry.







Abstract
Choline chloride (ChCl) based binary and ternary deep eutectic solvents (DES) were evaluated for methylene green electropolymerization with oxalic acid (OA) and ethylene glycol (EG) as hydrogen bond donors. Binary DES ChCl&#8201;:&#8201;OA in molar ratios 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 and 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 and ChCl&#8201;:&#8201;EG 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 and ternary DES (tDES) in different molar ratios and percentages of water were evaluated. The highest polymer growth was in ChCl&#8201;:&#8201;OA&#8201;:&#8201;EG&#8208;tDES with 13% added water, that had a lower viscosity and higher ionic conductivity when associated with HCl as dopant. This enhanced the formation of more cation radicals and, consequently, more polymer formation. The PMG/MWCNT/GCE&#8208;tDES sensor was successfully applied to the simultaneous determination of 5&#8208;aminosalicylic acid (5&#8208;ASA) and acetaminophen (APAP) by differential pulse voltammetry in the concentration range 1&#8197;&#956;M&#8211;200&#8197;&#956;M, with detection limits of 0.37&#8197;&#956;M and 0.49&#8197;&#956;M for 5&#8208;ASA and APAP, respectively. The sensor demonstrated good repeatability, reproducibility and stability, and was successfully applied in pharmaceutical formulations.

         <title>Modification of an AIE Fluorescent Probe for Monitoring the Polarity of Lipid Droplets Based on a Series of Synthesized Aryl Naphthalizes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 58, October 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of fluorescent probes were designed based on the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) mechanism to target LDs and detected cell polarity. The probes were modified using oligo&#8208;oligomeric PEG to increase biocompatibility, and the triphenylamine moiety enabled the probes to exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced luminescence (AIE) properties. The Nap&#8208;TPA&#8208;PEG3 probe exhibited a high degree of sensitivity to polarity.







Abstract
Lipid droplets (LDs) are subcellular organelles that are dynamic and play a central role in energy homeostasis and lipid metabolism. They also contribute to the transport and maturation of cellular proteins and are closely associated with several diseases. The important role of the cellular microenvironment in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Changes in cell polarity, particularly in organelles, have been found to be strongly linked to inflammation, Alzheimer's disease, cancer, and other illnesses. It is essential to check the polarity of the LDs. A series of arylated naphthalimide derivatives were synthesized using the Suzuki reaction. Modification of synthesized aryl naphthalimides using oligomeric PEG based on intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) mechanism. A series of fluorescent probes were designed to target LDs and detect their polarity. Nap&#8208;TPA&#8208;PEG3 probe exhibited high sensitivity to polarity. The addition of oligomeric polyethylene glycol (PEG) to the probe not only significantly improved its solubility in water, but also effectively reduced its cytotoxicity. In addition, the probe exhibited excellent aggregation&#8208;induced luminescence (AIE) properties and solvent discolouration effects. Nap&#8208;TPA&#8208;PEG3 probe exhibited high Pearson correlation coefficient (0.957163) in lipid droplet co&#8208;localization in cells. Nap&#8208;TPA&#8208;PEG3 could be used as an effective hand tool to monitor cell polarity.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Reduction of NOx by NH3 with Unity Conversion on Nanofilament MnO2/Activated Semi&#8208;Coke Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 58, October 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique nanofilament MnO2 grown on activated semi&#8208;coke demonstrates a marked 100&#8201;% conversion rate of NO at low temperatures down to 70&#8211;90&#8201;&#176;C in NH3, resulting from the promoted interaction of NO with NH3 on the catalytic sites.







Abstract
Selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides with NH3 at low temperatures remains a crucial goal for industrial applications. However, effective catalysts operating at 70&#8211;90&#8201;&#176;C are rarely reported, limiting SCR scenarios to high&#8208;temperature conditions. Herein, we report a unique MnO2 nanofilament catalyst grown on activated semi&#8208;coke synthesized via a one&#8208;step in&#8197;situ hydrothermal approach, which exhibits a stable and marked 100&#8201;% conversion rate of NO to N2 with 100&#8201;% selectivity at 90&#8201;&#176;C, superior to the other prepared structures (nanowires, nanorods, and nanotubes). Temperature&#8208;programmed desorption shows a large number of acid sites on MnO2(NFs)/ASC, benefiting the formation of NH4+ ions. Meanwhile, diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy reveals the activation of NO with O2 to form bidentate nitrate/bridging nitrate NO2 intermediates via bidentate nitrate species, triggering the Fast SCR with NH3 at low temperatures. Such an effective, easy&#8208;to&#8208;prepare, and low&#8208;cost catalyst paves a new pathway for low&#8208;temperature SCR for a wide range of application scenarios.

         <title>Ficini Reaction with Acrylates for the Stereoselective Synthesis of Aminocyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 58, October 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe herein the first catalytic Ficini reaction between ynamides and acrylates. This approach enables the formation of stable tri&#8208;substituted cyclobutenes and subsequent selective synthesis of aminocyclobutanes with unique stereochemical patterns.







Abstract
The first Ficini reaction between ynamides and acrylates is reported herein. The reaction is catalyzed by B(C6F5)3 acting as a Lewis acid and is giving access to stable tri&#8208;substituted aminocyclobutenes in high yield. The resulting products can be hydrogenated and epimerized under basic conditions or in presence of a Lewis acid, providing two distinct trans&#8208; aminocyclobutane monoester stereoisomers in high yield and diastereoisomeric ratio (up to quantitative yield and &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr).

&lt;p&gt;The first Ficini reaction between ynamides and acrylates is reported herein. The reaction is catalyzed by B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; acting as a Lewis acid and is giving access to stable &lt;i&gt;tri&lt;/i&gt;-substituted aminocyclobutenes in high yield. The resulting products can be hydrogenated and epimerized under basic conditions or in presence of a Lewis acid, providing two distinct &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;- aminocyclobutane monoester stereoisomers in high yield and diastereoisomeric ratio (up to quantitative yield and &amp;gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Functionalized Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for NADH Regeneration by Hydrogen in a Redox Flow Bioreactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 58, October 17, 2024. </description>

This work explores enhancing NADH regeneration for industrial chemical production by immobilizing [Rh(Cp*)(bpy)Cl]+ onto a 3D metal&#8208;organic framework (NU&#8208;1000) on graphite felt and utilizing a gas diffusion electrode to efficiently oxidize H2, enabling effective NADH regeneration and highly efficient enzymatic synthesis of L&#8208;lactate in a flow bioreactor. This method achieves significant turnover numbers (TTN) and turnover frequencies (TOF), providing valuable insights for building efficient enzymatic electrosynthesis systems in industrial production.







Abstract
The electrochemical regeneration of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) using [Rh(Cp*)(bpy)Cl]+ holds significant promise for the industrial synthesis of chiral chemicals. However, challenges persist due to the high consumption of NADH and the limited efficiency of its cyclic regeneration, which currently hinder widespread application. To address these obstacles, based on in&#8208;situ growth of 3D ordered metal&#8208;organic framework (NU&#8208;1000) on the surface of graphite felt, [Rh(Cp*)(bpy)Cl]+ were immobilized on the Zr6 nodes of NU&#8208;1000 by solvent&#8208;assisted ligand incorporation (SALI), and applied in a flow bioreactor. Moreover, we employ a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) to oxidize H2, providing a clean proton source for the electrochemical regeneration of NADH. Consequently, highly efficient enzymatic electrocatalytic synthesis of L&#8208;lactate was achieved when coupled with L&#8208;lactate dehydrogenases (LDH) as a model reaction, and the total turnover number (TTN) reached 19600 and 1750 for [Rh(Cp*)(bpy)Cl]+ and NAD+ after 48&#8197;h, corresponding to a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 2350&#8197;h&#8722;1 and 210&#8197;h&#8722;1 for [Rh(Cp*)(bpy)Cl]+ and NAD+, respectively. This work provides new insights for the construction of efficient enzymatic electrosynthesis systems in industrial production.

         <title>Dual Aliovalent Dopants Cu, Mn Engineered Eco&#8208;Friendly QDs for Ultra&#8208;Stable Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 58, October 17, 2024. </description>

Doping eco&#8208;friendly ZnInSe2/ZnSe core/shell quantum dots (QDs) with Cu and Mn tailors their optical properties for anti&#8208;counterfeiting. The engineered QDs exhibit bright orange photoluminescence at 606&#8197;nm with improved color purity and stability. Integrated into PMMA, they create durable luminescent inks suitable for complex encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.







Abstract
Doping in semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) using optically active dopants tailors their optical, electronic, and magnetic properties beyond what is achieved by controlling size, shape, and composition. Herein, we synergistically modulated the optical properties of eco&#8208;friendly ZnInSe2/ZnSe core/shell QDs by incorporating Cu&#8208;doping and Mn&#8208;alloying into their core and shell to investigate their use in anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption. The engineered &#8220;Cu:ZnInSe2/Mn:ZnSe&#8221; core/shell QDs exhibit an intense bright orange photoluminescence (PL) emission centered at 606&#8197;nm, with better color purity than the undoped and individually doped core/shell QDs. The average PL lifetime is significantly extended to 201&#8197;ns, making it relevant for complex encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. PL studies reveal that in Cu:ZnInSe2/Mn:ZnSe, the photophysical emission arises from the Cu state via radiative transition from the Mn 4T1 state. Integration of Cu:ZnInSe2/Mn:ZnSe core/shell QDs into poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) serves as versatile smart concealed luminescent inks for both writing and printing patterns. The features of these printed patterns using Cu:ZnInSe2/Mn:ZnSe core/shell QDs persisted after 10&#8197;weeks of water&#8208;soaking and retained 70&#8201;% of PL emission intensity at 170&#8201;&#176;C, demonstrating excellent thermal stability. This work provides an efficient approach to enhance both the emission and the stability of eco&#8208;friendly QDs via dopant engineering for fluorescence anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.

         <title>Effects of Ring Functionalization in Anthracene&#8208;Based Cyclophanes on the Binding Properties Toward Nucleotides and DNA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 58, October 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclophanes with different substitution patterns were prepared and studied for binding of nucleoside triphosphates and double&#8208;stranded DNA. While the ortho&#8208;phenyl derivative showed high affinity for nucleoside triphosphates, the meta&#8208;derivative demonstrated GC&#8208;selectivity and an intercalation binding mode with DNA.







Abstract
Supramolecular recognition of nucleobases and short sequences is an emerging research field focusing on possible applications to treat many diseases. Controlling the affinity and selectivity of synthetic receptors to target desired nucleotides or short sequences is a highly challenging task. Herein, we elucidate the effect of substituents in the phenyl ring of the anthracene&#8208;benzene azacyclophane on the recognition of nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) and double&#8208;stranded DNA. We show that introducing phenyl rings increases the affinity for NTPs 10&#8208;fold and implements groove and intercalation binding modes with double&#8208;stranded DNA. NMR studies and molecular modeling calculations support the ability of cyclophanes to encapsulate nucleobases as part of nucleotides.

         <title>Cationic or Neutral: Dependence of Photophysical Properties of Bis&#8208;Alkynylphosphonium Pt(II) Complexes on Ancillary Ligand</title>

Trans&#8208;alkynyl complexes of Pt(II) with D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A alkynylphosphonium ligands and with various ancillary ligands (triphenylphosphine and cyanide) demonstrate bright luminescence. The variation of the linker in the alkynylphosphonium ligands allows fine&#8208;tuning of the luminescence wavelength, and the ancillary ligands turn on&#8208;off the emission in solution and solid state. DFT calculations show the complicated nature of luminescence for the complexes obtained.







Abstract
A series of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A alkynylphosphonium salts with different linker between donor and acceptor groups was used to synthesize two series of trans&#8208;bis&#8208;alkynylphosphonium Pt(II) complexes with different ancillary ligands (triphenylphosphine, P series, and cyanide, CN series). The nature of the ancillary ligand manages the overall charge and emission properties of the complexes obtained. In addition, the variation of the linker in alkynylphosphonium ligands allows fine&#8208;tuning the luminescence wavelength. Dicationic series P is unstable in solution under UV excitation, whereas in the solid state, these complexes are the first example of phosphorescent trans&#8208;phosphine&#8208;bis&#8208;alkynyl Pt(II) compounds. Neutral series CN demonstrates bright emission in solution, including dual emission for 2CN complex with biphenyl linker in alkynylphosphonium ligand. However, in the solid state for the CN series drastic decrease in the emission quantum yield compared to the P series was observed. DFT calculations reveal the complicated emission nature for the both P and CN series with various contributions of 3ILCT, 3LLCT and 3MLCT states. However, in the naphthyl&#8208;containing derivatives 3P and 3CN, the dominating 3LC character with some admixture of CT states is postulated.

However, in the naphthyl-containing derivatives &lt;b&gt;3P&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3CN&lt;/b&gt;, the dominating &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;LC character with some admixture of CT states is postulated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Solid&#8208;State Multi&#8208;Color Fluorescence Switching from a [2.2]Paracyclophane&#8208;Based Triarylborane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 58, October 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fluorescence of a [2.2]paracyclophane&#8208;based triarylborane, which is modified by an electron&#8208;donating dimethylamino (NMe2) and an electron&#8208;accepting [(2&#8208;dimesityllboryl)phenyl]ethynyl at the pseudo&#8208;gem position of [2.2]paracyclophane skeleton, can be switched among four bright fluorescent colors in the solid state (&#934;F=0.31&#8211;0.87) by combination of the tricolor mechanochromic fluorescence and acidochromic fluorescence.







Abstract
The fluorophores, the fluorescence of which can be switched between multi bright colors in the solid state, show promising applications not only in the sophisticated multicolor display but also in the advanced encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting systems. However, it is very challenging to obtain such fluorophores. Herein, we disclose such an example, g&#8208;BPhANMe2&#8208;Cp, which contains an electron&#8208;donating dimethylamino (NMe2) and an electron&#8208;accepting [(2&#8208;dimesitylboryl)phenyl]acetyl at the pseudo&#8208;gem position of [2.2]paracyclophane skeleton. This molecule can display tricolor mechanochromic luminescence (MCL) due to the different responses of the mechanically ground amorphous state to heating and solvent&#8208;fuming. Owing to the absence of intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions in the solid state, the fluorescence efficiency is very high irrespective of its morphological state (&#934;F=0.60&#8211;0.87). Moreover, this molecule also displays reversible acidochromic luminescence (ACL) by protonation and deprotonation of NMe2 with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and triethylamine (TEA), respectively. The protonated sample fluoresces (&#934;F=0.31) at much shorter wavelength due to the interruption of intramolecular charge transfer process. Therefore, with the combination of tricolor MCL and ACL properties, the solid&#8208;state emission of g&#8208;BPhANMe2&#8208;Cp can be switched among four bright fluorescence colors of yellow, green, cyan and blue via treatment with appropriate stimulus.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship of Fluorinated Benzenesulfonamides as Inhibitors of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Aggregation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 58, October 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of fluorinated benzenesulfonamides were synthesized and characterized by their anti&#8208;amyloid potential. We investigated compound structure relationship for inhibiting amyloid&#8208;beta (A&#946;) aggregation, which is considered to be the onset of Alzheimer's disease. The synthesized molecules were effective at slowing down the A&#946; aggregation by extending its nucleation phase and reduced aggregate toxicity to SHSY&#8208;5Y cells.







Abstract
Amyloid&#8208;beta aggregation is considered one of the factors influencing the onset of the Alzheimer's disease. Early prevention of such aggregation should alleviate disease condition by applying small molecule compounds that shift the aggregation equilibrium toward the soluble form of the peptide or slow down the process. We have discovered that fluorinated benzenesulfonamides of particular structure slowed the amyloid&#8208;beta peptide aggregation process by more than three&#8208;fold. We synthesized a series of ortho&#8208;para and meta&#8208;para double&#8208;substituted fluorinated benzenesulfonamides that inhibited the aggregation process to a variable extent yielding a detailed picture of the structure&#8208;activity relationship. Analysis of compound chemical structure effect on aggregation in artificial cerebrospinal fluid showed the necessity to arrange the benzenesulfonamide, hydrophobic substituent, and benzoic acid in a particular way. The amyloid beta peptide aggregate fibril structures varied in cross&#8208;sectional height depending on the applied inhibitor indicating the formation of a complex with the compound. Application of selected inhibitors increased the survivability of cells affected by the amyloid beta peptide. Such compounds may be developed as drugs against Alzheimer's disease.

         <title>Highly Active Immobilized Catalyst for Ethylene Polymerization: Neutral Single Site Y(III) Complex Bearing Bulky Silylallyl Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 58, October 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designing of a highly active neutral yttrium supported catalyst for ethylene polymerization can be achieved by electronic and steric tuning of the ligand attached to the yttrium metal. This catalyst was implemented at a pre&#8208;industrial scale, demonstrating unprecedented activity and the desired high&#8208;density polyethylenes (HDPE) with a broad molar mass distribution, which is advantageous for resin processing.







Abstract
Exploring the surface organometallic chemistry on silica of highly electrophilic yttrium complexes is a relatively uncommon endeavor, particularly when focusing on tris&#8208;alkyl complexes characterized by Y&#8722;C &#963;&#8208;alkyl bonds. A drawback with this class of complexes once grafted on silica, is the frequent occurrence of alkyl transfer by ring opening of siloxane groups, resulting in a mixture of species. Herein, we employed a more stable homoleptic yttrium allyl complex bearing bulky &#951;3&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis(trimethylsilyl)allyl ligand to limit this transfer reaction. This strategy has been validated by comparing the reactivity between [Y{ &#951;3&#8208;1,3&#8208;C3H3(SiMe3)2}3] and [Y(o&#8208;CH2PhNMe2)3] with SiO2&#8211;700, where the undesired alkyl transfer reaction occurred for [Y(o&#8208;CH2PhNMe2)3] leading to a bipodal [(&#8801;SiO)2Y(o&#8208;CH2PhNMe2)] as major surface species, 2, while [Y{ &#951; 3&#8208;1,3&#8208;C3H3(SiMe3)2}3] resulted selectively in a monopodal species, [(&#8801;SiO)Y{&#951;3&#8208;1,3&#8208;C3H3(SiMe3)2}2], 1. The materials obtained were characterized by DRIFT, solid state NMR, mass balance analysis and EXAFS. Catalyst 1 showed high activity compared to 2 in ethylene polymerization. The catalytic performance of this neutral catalyst 1 was extended to pre&#8208;industrial scale in the presence of hydrogen and 1&#8208;hexene. An unprecedented activity, up to 7400&#8197;gPE&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 was obtained even with very low concentration of scavenger AliBu3 (TIBA/Y=1.2). The obtained HDPE exhibited desired spherical particle morphology with broad molar mass distribution.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Aromatization&#8208;Driven Ring&#8208;Opening Amination and Oxygenation of Spiro Dihydroquinazolinones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 58, October 17, 2024. </description>

Abstract
Mild and inexpensive copper&#8208;catalyzed aromatization&#8208;driven ring&#8208;opening amination and oxygenation of spiro dihydroquinazolinones are presented, respectively. These protocols provide facile and atom&#8208;economical access to the aminated and the carbonyl&#8208;containing quinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones in good yields with good functional group compatibility, which are difficult to obtain by conventional methods. Remarkably, a telescoped procedure involving the condensation and the ring&#8208;opening/functionalization for simple cycloalkanone was found to be accessible. Mechanistic studies suggest a radical pathway for this transformation.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Dinitrogen Reduction to Ammonia Using Easily Reducible N&#8208;Fused Cobalt Porphyrins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 58, October 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
New single&#8208;site molecular electrocatalysts, based on easily reducible N&#8208;fused cobalt porphyrins, have been developed for dinitrogen reduction to ammonia. Faradic efficiencies have been achieved in the 6&#8211;7.5&#8201;% range with ammonia yield rates of 300&#8211;340&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at room temperature and neutral pH conditions. Mild reaction conditions for dinitrogen electro&#8208;reduction are accomplished.







Abstract
Single&#8208;site molecular electrocatalysts, especially those that perform catalytic conversion of N2 to NH3 under mild conditions, are highly desirable to derive fundamental structure&#8208;activity relations and as potential alternatives to the current energy&#8208;consuming Haber&#8208;Bosch ammonia production process. Combining theoretical calculations with experimental evidence, it has been shown that easily reducible cobalt porphyrins catalyze the six&#8208;electron, six&#8208;proton reduction of dinitrogen to NH3 at neutral pH and under ambient conditions. Two easily reducible N&#8208;fused cobalt porphyrins &#8211; CoNHF and CoNHF(Br)2 &#8211; reveal NRR activity with Faradic efficiencies between 6&#8211;7.5&#8201;% with ammonia yield rates of 300&#8211;340&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Contrary to this, much harder&#8208;to&#8208;reduce N&#8208;fused porphyrins &#8211; CoNHF(Ph)2 and CoNHF(PE)2 &#8211; reveal no NRR activity. The present study highlights the significance of tuning the redox and structural properties of single&#8208;site NRR electrocatalysts for improved NRR activity under mild conditions.

         <title>Tetradentate Pt(II) Complexes Based on Xylenylamino Linked Dual Pyrazolate Chelates for Organic Light Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 58, October 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functional tetradentate chelates composed of two pyrazolate chelates and one xylenylamino linker were employed in preparation of Pt(II) complexes showing efficient ligand&#8208;centered &#960;&#960;* transition characteristics. Upon fabrication of OLED devices, Pt4N2 and Pt4N3 based devices delivered efficient cyan and green emission, with an EQEmax of 15.2&#8201;% and 11.2&#8201;%, respectively, affirming the successfulness of the tetradentate chelating strategy.







Abstract
In this work, we report the syntheses of three Pt(II) emitters, namely, Pt4N1, Pt4N2, and Pt4N3, to which their tetradentate chelates were assembled by linking two pyrazolate chelates with a single xylenylamino entity. Functionalization of Pt4N1 was achieved upon the addition of electronegative CF3 substituent on pyridinyl groups and switching to more electron&#8208;deficient pyrazinyl groups in giving Pt4N2 and Pt4N3, respectively. The vertically arranged xylenylamino entity has effectively suppressed the inter&#8208;molecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and Pt&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt interaction, as shown by the single crystal X&#8208;ray structural analyses. Upon fabrication of OLED devices, Pt4N2 and Pt4N3 based devices delivered efficient cyan and green emission, with an EQEmax of 15.2&#8201;% and 11.2&#8201;%, respectively, affirming the successfulness of the tetradentate chelating strategy.

Mononuclear and multinuclear indium&#8208;based MOFs with water stability were synthesized by using DMA and DMF/DMSO/H2O mixed solvent, respectively. Two MOFs both exhibit good sensing properties for acetone and Fe3+ ions. Meanwhile, the multinuclear indium&#8208;based MOF also demonstrates exceptional CO2 adsorption capacity and selectivity.







Abstract
Two water&#8208;stable indium metal&#8208;organic frameworks, (NH2Me2)3[In3(BTB)4]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;12DMA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4.5H2O (In&#8208;MOF&#8208;1) and (NH2Me2)9[In9O6(BTB)8(H2O)4(DMSO)4]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;27DMSO&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;21H2O (In&#8208;MOF&#8208;2) (BTB=4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tribenzoate) with 3D interpenetrated structure has been constructed by regulating solvents. Structure analysis revealed that In&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 has a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) structure with a single metal core, while In&#8208;MOF&#8208;2 features an octahedron cage constructed by three kinds of metal clusters to further form a 3D structure. The fluorescence investigations showed that In&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 and In&#8208;MOF&#8208;2 are potential MOF&#8208;based fluorescent sensors to detect acetone and Fe3+ ions in EtOH or water with high sensitivity, excellent selectivity, recyclability and a low limit of detection. Moreover, the fluorescence mechanisms of In&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 and In&#8208;MOF&#8208;2 toward acetone and Fe3+ ions were further explained. In addition, In&#8208;MOF&#8208;2 has higher thermal and framework stability than In&#8208;MOF&#8208;1. The activated In&#8208;MOF&#8208;2 presents a high BET surface area of 998.82&#8197;m2g&#8722;1 and a pore size distribution of 8 to 16&#8197;&#197;. At the same time, In&#8208;MOF&#8208;2 exhibits high selective CO2 adsorption for CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2, respectively. Furthermore, the adsorption sites and adsorption isotherms were predicted using grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations, and the adsorption energy of the lowest&#8208;energy adsorption configuration was calculated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.

         <title>Fabrication of a Multi&#8208;Functional Separator Incorporating Crown ether&#8208; Polyoxometalate Supramolecular Compound for Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>

The KPW&#8208;CR6/GO/PP separator demonstrated the ability to synergistically capture and expedite the rapid conversion of lithium Polysulfides (LiPSs) during electrochemical processes. Moreover, the Crown ether&#8208;POM supramolecular complex, through its crown ether array, has shown a notable degree of success in preventing POM catalyst leaching. This augmentation markedly enhances the performance of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. As a result, the capacity remained significant even after 160 cycles at 0.5&#8197;C at a high sulfur loading density of 3.2&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2, decreasing from 543.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8211;487.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, with a capacity decay rate of merely 0.006&#8201;% per cycle.







Abstract
Recently, research on polyoxometalates (POMs) has gained significant momentum. Owing to their properties as electronic sponges, POMs catalyst harbor substantial potential in lithium&#8208;sulfur battery research. However, POMs undergo a transformation into reduced heteropoly blue (HPB) during electrochemical reactions, which then dissolve into the electrolyte, resulting in catalyst loss. In this research, we amalgamated 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 (CR6) with K3PW12O40, (KPW), synthesized a novel POM&#8208;based supramolecular compound, and integrated it with graphene oxide (GO) to fabricate a multi&#8208;functional composite polypropylene (PP) separator KPW&#8208;CR6/GO/PP. The crown ether array was employed to immobilize POM and construct ion transport channels, thereby enhancing the Li+ migration rate and capturing polysulfides. Subsequently, leveraging the stable structure and redox properties of POM, the polysulfide is catalyzed to transform and inhibit the shuttle effect, thereby protecting the Li anode. The lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries with the Crown ether&#8208;POM supramolecular compound separators, exhibit enhanced capacity and stability (1073.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1.0&#8197;C, and 81.5&#8201;% retention rate after 250 cycles). The battery (S loading: 3.2&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) presents an initial specific discharge capacity of 543.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;C, with 89.8&#8201;% of the capacity retained after 160 cycles. This underlines the practical application potential of Crown ether&#8208;POM supramolecular materials in Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Front Cover: Exohedral Diels&#8208;Alder Reactivity of Endohedral Metallofullerene C36 (Chem. Eur. J. 58/2024)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 58, October 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Diels&#8211;Alder reactivity of the C36 fullerene and endohedral metallofullerene results in various regiospecific cycloadducts. Our DFT calculations at S12g/TZ2P indicate that the [5&#8211;5] and [6&#8211;5] bonds are most reactive. Zinc remains in the center, whereas iron and scandium move towards the upper side of the cage. The presence of iron favors the bonds close to it, but scandium favors those on the opposite side of the cage. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Osuna, M. Swart and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202401568).

         <dc:description>
Cationic phosphine alkynylphosphonium PtII complexes are more efficient emitters in the solid state than neutral cyanide ones. The former are also the first example of triplet solid&#8208;state emitters among phosphine&#8208;alkynyl PtII systems. However, they do not demonstrate any solution luminescence. Cyanide systems are hardly soluble, but can have dual emission in DMSO. Changing the ligand linker in both series allows fine&#8208;tuning of the emission wavelength. More information can be found in the Research Article by E. Grachova and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202402242).

A new class of fluorinated benzenesulfonamide has been synthesized and characterized by their anti&#8208;amyloid potential. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202402330), D. Matulis and co&#8208;workers investigate the compounds&#8217; structure&#8211;activity relationship for inhibiting amyloid&#8208;beta (A&#946;) aggregation, which is considered to be the onset of Alzheimer's disease. The synthesized molecules were effective at slowing down A&#946; aggregation by extending its nucleation phase and reduced aggregate toxicity to SHSY&#8208;5Y cells.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A new class of fluorinated benzenesulfonamide&lt;/b&gt; has been synthesized and characterized by their anti-amyloid potential. In their Research Article (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202402330"&gt;10.1002/chem.202402330&lt;/a&gt;), D. Matulis and co-workers investigate the compounds&#8217; structure&#8211;activity relationship for inhibiting amyloid-beta (A&#946;) aggregation, which is considered to be the onset of Alzheimer's disease. The synthesized molecules were effective at slowing down A&#946; aggregation by extending its nucleation phase and reduced aggregate toxicity to SHSY-5Y cells.

         <title>Comparative analysis of tetravalent actinide Schiff base complexes: influence of donor and ligand backbone on molecular geometry and metal binding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of isostructural early actinide AnIV complexes was synthesized in order to investigate the influence of a conjugated framework in the ligand backbone on An bonding. Therefore, the AnIV complexes [An(pyrophen)2] (An = Th, U, Np, and Pu) with the pure N&#8208;donor ligand bis(2&#8208;pyrrolecarbonylaldehyde)&#8208;o&#8208;phenylenediamine referred to as pyrophen, were synthesized and characterized. Solid state analysis via single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD) reveals two sets of ligands binding in an almost orthogonal arrangement to the actinide center. For the larger actinides Th and U, the coordination sphere allows for additional coordination by a solvent molecule. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) studies show the presence of highly symmetrical complexes in solution in good agreement with the solvent&#8208;free solid structures. While SC&#8208;XRD suggests mainly ionic binding, an analysis of paramagnetic NMR contributions and quantum chemical bond analysis hint towards significant covalency in the U, Np, and Pu compounds. This series of An complexes allowed for a thorough structural and theoretical comparison of a conjugated system to a closely related N&#8208;donor ligand (pyren)[1], as well as to the mixed N,O Schiff base ligands salophen (conjugated) and salen (non&#8208;conjugated).</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Pnictogen and Ligand Framework on the Lewis Acidity and Steric Environment in Pnictogen Pincer Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pnictogen pincer complexes are a fascinating class of compounds due to their dynamic molecular and electronic structures, and valuable stoichiometric or catalytic reactivity. As recognition of their unique chemistry has grown, so too has the library of pincer ligands employed and pnictogen centres engaged to prepare them. Here we computationally study how the choice of pincer ligand framework and pnictogen influence the electronic and steric outcomes of the complexes obtained. The most relevant electronic parameter is the pnictogen&#8208;centred electrophilicity, which has been quantified by fluoride ion affinities and LUMO energies, while the most relevant steric parameter is the crowding around the central pnictogen, which has been quantified by the %Vbur values and visualized using steric maps. The resulting trends are analyzed with reference to binding pocket size, acceptor orbital type, electronic delocalization, &#960;&#8208;donor strengths, and heteroatom incorporation. Thus, considering 16 ligand frameworks and 4 heavy pnictogen centres, this study provides a broad&#8208;spectrum view of stereo&#8208;electronic variation in pnictogen pincer complexes, which, together with a recent study on geometric variation in the same family, provides a substantial dataset to guide future molecular design and reactivity studies.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two homologous series of pnictogen(III) dications, stabilized by 2,6&#8208;bis(benzimidazole&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyridine ligands have been prepared. Both series contain PnIII&#8722;X moieties (Pn = P, As, Sb, Bi; X = Cl or Ph) and have been fully characterized using spectroscopic methods including X&#8208;ray crystallography. The Lewis acidity of these compounds has also been probed by computational methods; the results suggest that the dictations are strong Lewis acids, with the PnCl2+ compounds being more acidic than the PnPh2+ compounds, and with Lewis acidity increasing from P to Bi, in both series. The PhP2+&#8208;containing compound was also found to be a versatile PIII transfer reagent, leading to new synthetic routes for various PhP&#8208;containing compounds. The redox chemistry of all compounds has also been probed using cyclic voltammetry and chemical reductions. In some cases the resulting PnI moieties could be trapped using diazabutadienes.</dc:description>

Acridinium&#8208;based organo&#8208;photocatalysts, notable for visible light responsiveness, efficiently functionalize inert C&#8722;H bonds under mild conditions without transition metals. This review highlights their role in green chemistry, enabling diverse, eco&#8208;friendly synthetic routes and the diversification of pharmaceuticals and complex molecules.







Abstract
Using organic dyes as photocatalysts is an innovative approach to photocatalytic organic transformations. These dyes offer advantages such as widespread availability, adaptable absorption properties, and diverse chemical structures. Recent progress has led to the development of organic photocatalysts that can utilize visible light to modify chemically inert C&#8722;H bonds. These catalysts are sustainable, selective, and versatile, enabling mild reactions, late&#8208;stage functionalization, and various transformations in line with green chemistry principles. As catalysts in photoredox chemistry, they contribute to the development of efficient and environmentally friendly synthetic pathways. Acridinium&#8208;based organic photocatalysts have proved valuable in late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization, enabling transformative reactions under mild conditions. This review emphasizes their innovative features, such as organic frameworks, efficient light absorption properties, and their applications in modifying complex molecules. It provides an overview of recent advancements in the use of acridinium&#8208;based organic photocatalysts for late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H bond functionalization without the need for transition metals, showcasing their potential to expedite the development of new molecules and igniting excitement about the prospects of this research in the field.

         <title>Strategies and Applications for Supramolecular Protein Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular hierarchical protein self&#8208;assembly is vital for constructing diverse and functional biomaterials, as well as to explore information exchange and cooperation between proteins. In this paper, the classical supramolecular protein assembly construction strategies and the flexible regulaion of assemblies are summarized and analyzed. In addition, the applications and the enormous potential and significance of supramolecular protein materials are also reviewed.







Abstract
Supramolecular chemistry achieves higher&#8208;order molecular self&#8208;assembly through non&#8208;covalent interactions. Utilizing supramolecular methods to explore the polymorphism of proteins, the building blocks of life, from a &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; perspective is essential for constructing diverse and functional biomaterials. In recent years, significant progress has been achieved in the design strategies and functional applications of supramolecular protein self&#8208;assembly, becoming a focal point for researchers. This paper reviews classical supramolecular strategies driving protein self&#8208;assembly, including electrostatic interactions, metal coordination, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, host&#8208;guest interactions, and other mechanisms. We discuss how these supramolecular interactions regulate protein assembly processes and highlight protein supramolecular assemblies&#8242; unique structural and functional advantages in constructing artificial photosynthetic systems, protein hydrogels, bio&#8208;delivery systems, and other functional materials. The enormous potential and significance of supramolecular protein materials are elucidated. Finally, the challenges in preparing and applying protein supramolecular assemblies are summarized, and future development directions are projected.

We discuss how these supramolecular interactions regulate protein assembly processes and highlight protein supramolecular assemblies&#8242; unique structural and functional advantages in constructing artificial photosynthetic systems, protein hydrogels, bio-delivery systems, and other functional materials. The enormous potential and significance of supramolecular protein materials are elucidated. Finally, the challenges in preparing and applying protein supramolecular assemblies are summarized, and future development directions are projected.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>C(sp2)&#8208;Arylsulfones Directly from Arylsulfonyl Chlorides with Boronic Acids by Photoactivation of Boosted EDA Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Directly with arylsulfonyl chlorides, a green and efficient deborylativesulfonylation of aryl(alkenyl)boronic acids has been developed to access both diarylsulfones and vinylarylsulfones in moderate to excellent yields at room temperature under visible&#8208;light irradiation. This protocol features broad C(sp2)&#8208;arylsulfone applicability, simple operation, accessibility of raw materials and ease of scale&#8208;up. The key to the success of this photoredox transformation is introducing catalytic amounts of additives, naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ols, thus boosting the formed electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes, which can dramatically improve not only the reaction efficiency but also the selectivity. This strategy&#160;was inspired and derived from specific substrates, representing a rare paradigm of how to exploit a more general reaction system. Moreover, extensive control experiments provide insights into the proposed mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>A Sodium Metal&#8722;Organic Framework with Deep Blue Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is a great challenge to manufacture room&#8208;temperature blue long afterglow phosphorescent materials adapted to environmental conditions. Herein, an Na&#8208;based metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF) was constructed using Na+ and 1H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole&#8208;3,5&#8208;dicarboxylic acid, which exhibits long&#8208;lived of 378.9 ms, deep blue and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence, meanwhile possesses the visible blue afterglow for 3~6 seconds after removing excitation light source. The three&#8208;dimensional coordination bonds network provided by Na&#8208;based MOF protects the organic ligands intrinsic hydrogen bond network, resulting in the phosphor lifetime and residual color remaining unchanged in different gas atmospheres. Furthermore, first&#8208;principles time&#8208;dependent density functional theory reveals that the rigid Na&#8208;based MOF structure can limit the rotation and vibration of the room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent organic ligands. This limitation results in the suppression of non&#8208;radiative decay for both singlet and triplet excitons, promotes intersystem crossing, and increases the rate of radiative decay, ultimately achieving long&#8208;lived room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulatory Mechanisms and Synergistic Enhancement of the Diiron YtfE Protein in Nitric Oxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The diiron&#8208;containing YtfE protein in Escherichia coli is pivotal in counteracting nitrosative stress, a critical barrier to bacterial viability. This study delves into the biochemical complexity governing YtfE's conversion of nitric oxide (NO) to nitrous oxide, a key process for alleviating nitrosative stress. Through site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, we explored YtfE's molecular structure, with a particular focus on two internal transport tunnels important for its activity. Our findings illuminate Tunnel 1 as the primary conduit for substrate transport, regulated by conformational shifts within the N&#8208;terminal domain that enable substrate access to the diiron core in the C&#8208;terminal domain. Tunnel 2 emerges as a secondary, supportive route, activated when Tunnel 1 is compromised. This result challenges a previous model of distinct tunnels for substrate entry and product exit, suggesting both tunnels are capable of transporting substrates and products. Our engineering efforts enhanced the role of Tunnel 2, enabling a synergistic operation with Tunnel 1 and tripling YtfE's enzymatic activity compared to its wild&#8208;type form. This research not only deepens our understanding of YtfE&#8217;s regulatory mechanism for NO reduction but also introduces a strategy to amplify its enzymatic efficiency. The outcomes offer new ravenues for modulating bacterial stress responses.</dc:description>

         <title>Physicochemical Analysis of Cu(II)&#8208;Driven Electrochemical CO2 Reduction and its Competition with Proton Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reduction of CO2 has become a key role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in efforts to search for long&#8208;term responses to climate change. We report a a couple of CO2&#8208;reducing molecular catalysts based on earth&#8208;abundant copper complexes. These are [Cu(DPA)(PyNAP)] (1) and [Cu(DPA)(PyQl)] (2) (where, DPA = pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarboxylic acid, PyNAP = 2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthyridine, and PyQl = 2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)quinoline). The copper metal&#8208;catalysed 2&#8208;electron reduction of CO2 to CO in the presence of 2&#8208;protons is challenging. These catalysts exhibit the production of CO gas in DMF/water mixtures, achieving an impressive faradaic efficiency of&#160; 84% and 72% for complex 1 and 2 at &#8208;1.7 V vs. SCE, respectively, for selective CO2 reduction. The production of H2 due to 2H+ + 2e&#8208; was also observed as a byproduct through the competitive proton reduction reaction. This was cross&#8208;verified by online gas and mass analysis.&#160;&#160;Our investigations confirmed the stability of the electrocatalysts under the electrocatalytic conditions. The mechanistic pathways were proposed to work with the EECC and ECEC (E: electrochemical and C: chemical) mechanisms. A CO2 insertion into an in&#8208;situ generated hydride from the Cu&#8208;center generates CO through the favourable path.</dc:description>

         <title>Steric Engineering of Rotaxane Catalysts: Benefits and Limits of Using the Mechanical Bond in Catalyst Design</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a series of BINOL based catalysts in which the number of interlocked macrocycles is varied. The thread, [2]rotaxane and [3]rotaxane show a drastically different behavior in catalysis. In enantioselective transformations, the interlocked macrocycles are detrimental to stereoselectivity whereas in lactide polymerization, they increase the molecular weight of the polymer.







Abstract
The mechanical bond is emerging as a novel design element in catalyst development. Here, we report a series of 1,1&#8217;&#8208;binaphthyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;diol (BINOL) based catalysts in which the number of interlocked macrocycles is varied. Unsurprisingly, the macrocycles have a profound steric influence on the catalytic performance of these molecules. However, in the enantioselective transformations examined, the macrocycles are detrimental to catalyst stereoselectivity whereas in lactide polymerization, they increase the molecular weight of the polymeric product.

         <title>Facile Method to Obtain Functionalised &#951;6&#8208;Bound Arenes in Ru(II) and Os(II) Half&#8208;Sandwich Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We pioneer the use of a practical C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp2) coupling method to obtain Ru(II)&#8208; and Os(II)&#8208;&#951;6&#8208;arene half&#8208;sandwich complexes with a wide variety of arene functionalities, including those that enable the formation of tether rings. We synthesise 28 new complexes bearing eight different substituents, mostly unreported for Ru(II) or Os(II) half&#8208;sandwich complexes, such as quinoline (tethered and non&#8208;tethered) and coumarin.







Abstract
Half&#8208;sandwich Ru(II)&#8208; and Os(II)&#8208;arene complexes have great potential for catalytic and biological applications. The possibility of fine&#8208;tuning their chemical reactivity by including modifications in the ligands around the metal adds to their many advantages. However, structural modifications at the &#951;6&#8208;bound arene have had significant synthetic limitations, particularly in the design of Os(II)&#8208;tethered complexes. For the first time, we have employed a practical C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp2) coupling to obtain 28 new Ru(II) and Os(II) &#951;6&#8208;arene half&#8208;sandwich complexes with a wide variety of arene functionalities, including those that enable the formation of tether rings, such as quinoline, and coumarin. The introduction of novel functional groups at the arene in Ru(II)&#8208; and Os(II) half&#8208;sandwich complexes can broaden the synthetic scope of this type of organometallic complexes, and help to take full advantage of their structural diversity, for example, in intracellular catalysis.

&lt;p&gt;We pioneer the use of a practical C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)-C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) coupling method to obtain Ru(II)- and Os(II)-&#951;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-arene half-sandwich complexes with a wide variety of arene functionalities, including those that enable the formation of tether rings. We synthesise 28 new complexes bearing eight different substituents, mostly unreported for Ru(II) or Os(II) half-sandwich complexes, such as quinoline (tethered and non-tethered) and coumarin.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Half-sandwich Ru(II)- and Os(II)-arene complexes have great potential for catalytic and biological applications. The possibility of fine-tuning their chemical reactivity by including modifications in the ligands around the metal adds to their many advantages. However, structural modifications at the &#951;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-bound arene have had significant synthetic limitations, particularly in the design of Os(II)-tethered complexes. For the first time, we have employed a practical C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)-C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) coupling to obtain 28 new Ru(II) and Os(II) &#951;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-arene half-sandwich complexes with a wide variety of arene functionalities, including those that enable the formation of tether rings, such as quinoline, and coumarin. The introduction of novel functional groups at the arene in Ru(II)- and Os(II) half-sandwich complexes can broaden the synthetic scope of this type of organometallic complexes, and help to take full advantage of their structural diversity, for example, in intracellular catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>From Double&#8208;Stranded Helicates to Abiotic Double Helical Supramolecular Assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The folding of oligomeric strands is the method that nature has selected to generate ordered assemblies presenting spectacular functions. In the purpose to mimic these biomacro&#8208;molecules and extend their properties and functions, chemists make important efforts to prepare artificial secondary, tertiary, and even quarternary structures based on folded abiotic backbones. A large variety of oligomers and polymers, encoded with chemical informations, were designed, synthesized and characterized, and the establishment of non&#8208;covalent interactions lead to complex and functional supramolecular architectures resulting from a spontaneous self&#8208;assembly process. The association of comple&#8208;mentary molecular strands into double helical structures is a common structural pattern of nucleic acids and proteins, so the synthesis of bio&#8208;inspired double helices has emerged as an important subject. In recent years, a number of synthetic oligo&#8208;mers have been reported to form stable double helices and it was shown that the equilibrium between single and double helices can be controlled via different stimuli like the modification of the solvent or the temperature. This kind of structure presents highly interesting functions, such as molecular recognition within the cavity of double helices, and some other potential applications will emerge in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Experimental and computational studies of steric factors in the isomerization of internal alkynes within the coordination environment of half&#8208;sandwich metal complexes</title>

         <dc:description>The isomerization of internal alkynes Ar1C&#8801;CAr2 within the coordination environment of low&#8208;valent half&#8208;sandwich [Ru(dppe)Cp]+ complexes via a 1,2&#8208;migration process affords vinylidene species [Ru{=C=C(Ar1)Ar2}(dppe)Cp]+. The rearrangement reactions of symmetrically and asymmetrically substituted substrates featuring different electron&#8208;donating and &#8208;withdrawing groups and of varying steric bulk were modelled using density functional theory (DFT), and the conclusions supported by experimental observations. Examination of the reaction pathway and associated activation barriers reveal a high solvent dependency for the generation of the key intermediate species [Ru(dppe)Cp]+ from [RuCl(dppe)Cp] by Na+ induced halide abstraction , with the lattice enthalpy of the NaCl by&#8208;product playing a critical role in the overall thermochemical balance of the reaction. The activation barriers associated with the reaction of [Ru(dppe)Cp]+ with Ar1C&#8801;CAr2, and the relative energies of the alkyne complexes [Ru(h2&#8208;Ar1C&#8801;CAr2)(dppe)Cp]+, are sensitive to the electron density of the alkyne and conformational changes associated with the &#8216;bend&#8208;back&#8217; of the substrate. The latter differs by up to 66.1 kJ/mol, which in turn impacts the barrier height of the subsequent 1,2&#8208;migration step . The relative importance of these factors is evinced by the successful rearrangement of the very sterically congested 1(9&#8208;anthryl)&#8208;2(9&#8208;phenanthryl) acetylene into the fully characterized diaryl vinylidene complex, which was isolated in 89% yield.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous Hydrogenation of an Insulated Diarylacetylene Dimer Incorporated as Axle Molecules in a Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based [c2]Daisy Chain Rotaxane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The [c2]daisy chain rotaxane is an attractive interlocked molecule for the development of functional materials because of its unique mechanical properties that respond to various external stimuli, resulting in extension and contraction motions along the molecular axis. The synthesis of several &#8216;impossible&#8217; [2]rotaxanes that do not exhibit obvious binding motifs between their axle and wheel moieties has been achieved through further chemical modification of their axle moieties within pre&#8208;prepared [2]rotaxanes. However, no &#8216;impossible&#8217; [c2]daisy chain rotaxane has been synthesized using similar strategies until now. In this study, we investigated the hydrogenation of diarylacetylene moieties within a permethylated &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (PM &#945;&#8208;CD)&#8208;based [c2]daisy chain rotaxane using Pd/C or Pd/CaCO3 under hydrogen. A new [c2]daisy chain rotaxane featuring two diarylethane moieties was successfully synthesized through the simultaneous full hydrogenation of the insulated diarylacetylene moieties under optimized conditions. The new rotaxane is classified as an &#8216;impossible&#8217; [c2]daisy chain rotaxane due to the lack of obvious binding motifs between diarylethane and the PM &#945;&#8208;CD. This work demonstrates for the first time that the insulated axle moieties of [c2]daisy chain rotaxanes can undergo novel chemical modifications using a synthetic strategy employing transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation, which can potentially advance the development of nanoarchitectures with functional interlocked molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Pure Shift NMR in Continuous Flow</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flow NMR is an expanding analytical approach with applications that include in&#8208;line analysis for process control and optimisation, and real&#8208;time reaction monitoring. The samples monitored by flow NMR are typically mixtures that yield complex 1D&#160;1H spectra. &#8220;Pure shift&#8221; NMR is a powerful approach to simplifying&#160;1H NMR spectra, but its standard implementation is not compatible with continuous flow because of interference between sample motion and the position&#8208;dependent spin manipulations that are required in pure shift NMR. Here we show that pure shift NMR spectra can be successfully collected for continuously flowing samples, thanks to an adapted acquisition scheme, robust solvent suppression, and a velocity&#8208;compensation strategy. The resulting method is used to collect ultrahigh resolution reaction monitoring data. Pure shift NMR spectra are expected to benefit many applications of flow NMR.</dc:description>

         <title>Syn vs. Anti? What Controls Addition Stereochemistry in Chlorolactonization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stereochemistry of the uncatalyzed chlorolactonization of 4&#8208;phenylpent&#8208;4&#8208;enoic acid at room temperature was examined to probe the reaction&#8217;s intrinsic diastereoselectivities as a function of chlorenium ion donor, solvent polarity, and reactant concentration ranges. Kinetic studies using Variable Time Normalization Analysis (VTNA) revealed differing reaction orders for the syn and anti alkene addition processes. Aided and illustrated by quantum chemical modeling, this detailed mechanistic analysis of the substrate&#8217;s intrinsic chlorolactonization reactions points to concerted AdE3&#8208;type paths for both syn and anti additions.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The stereochemistry of the uncatalyzed chlorolactonization of 4-phenylpent-4-enoic acid at room temperature was examined to probe the reaction&#8217;s intrinsic diastereoselectivities as a function of chlorenium ion donor, solvent polarity, and reactant concentration ranges. Kinetic studies using Variable Time Normalization Analysis (VTNA) revealed differing reaction orders for the syn and anti alkene addition processes. Aided and illustrated by quantum chemical modeling, this detailed mechanistic analysis of the substrate&#8217;s intrinsic chlorolactonization reactions points to concerted AdE3-type paths for both syn and anti additions. By illuminating the factors selecting for syn- vs anti-addition paths, the results provide key reference points for future studies of stereocontrol in halofunctionalization reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Emergent Behavior of a Photoswitchable Solute in a Biphasic Solvent System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to thermal E/Z isomerization, hydrazones in solution typically exist in thermodynamic equilibria between their isomers. Irradiation of such solutions leads to photostationary states that may differ from the equilibrium distribution. Operating such switchable hydrazones in a biphasic system of two immiscible solvents introduces three new degrees of freedom: the E/Z equilibrium in the second solvent and two equilibria for distribution of each of the isomers between the solvents. Irradiation of such a system can be performed in three different ways &#8211; the first solvent only, the second solvent only, and both solvents at once &#8211; all yielding distinct outcomes. Depending on the choice of materials and the mode of irradiation, such setup may lead to different emergent behaviors that are not immediately intuitive, including net cyclic transport or the accumulation of one photoswitched product in one of the phases, beyond what is reachable by irradiating a simple solution of the same photoswitch.</dc:description>

         <title>Manipulation of Supramolecular Chirality in Bicontinuous Networks of Bent&#8208;Shaped Polycatenar &#160;Dimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bicontinuous cubic liquid crystalline (LC) phases are of particular interest due their possible applications in electronic devices and special supramolecular chirality. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of first examples of achiral bent&#8208;shaped polycatenar dimers, capable of displaying mirror symmetry breaking in their cubic and isotropic liquid phases. The molecules have a taper&#8208;shaped 3,4,5&#8208;trialkoxybenzoate segment connected to rod&#8208;like building unit terminated with one terminal flexible chain. The two segments were connected using an aliphatic spacer with seven methylene units to induce bending of the whole structure. Investigated by the small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS), a double network achiral cubic phase Cub/Ia3 d, which is a meso&#8208;structure, and a chiral triple network cubic phase Cub/I23[*] are formed. The molecules self&#8208;assemble into molecular helices and progress along the networks. Interestingly, different linking groups such as ester or azo linkages and core fluorination lead to distinct local helicity, resulting in an alkyl chain volume dependent phase transition sequence Ia3d(L)&#8208;I23*&#8208;Ia3d(S). The re&#8208;entry of Iad phase and loss of supramolecular chirality is attributed to the delicate influence of steric effect at the mono&#8208;substitute end and interhelix interaction. Besides, aromatic core fluorination was proved to be a successful tool stabilizing the cubic phases in these dimers.</dc:description>

         <title>Ag108(PEt3)24Cl6: A Hexagonal Prismatic Metalloid Cluster</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ligands used for the protection of metalloid clusters heavily influence the resulting structure and shape. For silver, thiolate and alkynyl ligands are commonly used, while phosphines usually play a minor role as co&#8208;ligands. Herein, we report the synthesis and structural characterization of Ag108(PEt3)24Cl6 (1), the largest structurally characterized metalloid silver cluster with phosphines and halides as sole ligands. Instead of the frequently observed spherical shape of metalloid clusters, 1&#8217;s structure resembles a hexagonal prism. The highly light and temperature sensitive compound features many similarities to its smaller congener Ag64(PnBu3)16Cl6, though there are distinct structural and electronic differences present. Within 1, a Ag64 subunit can be found, which identifies these clusters as molecular seeds for the formation of faceted nanoparticles.</dc:description>

         <title>Widening the stimuli&#8208;responsiveness of aqueous biphasic systems by changing the ionic liquid cation basicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we demonstrate the formation of new stimuli&#8208;responsive aqueous biphasic systems (ABS), able to respond simultaneously to temperature and pH, or just to one stimulus, therefore allowing the design of more sustainable separation processes. This dual behavior is achieved with ABS formed by mono or dicationic protic ionic liquids as phase&#8208;forming components, being defined by the ionic liquid cation chemical structure or its basicity. While ABS comprising monocationic ionic liquids only respond to the effect of temperature, systems comprising dicationic ionic liquids are simultaneously affected by both temperature and pH variations. Dicationic ionic liquids are here identified as the key to unlock a double response to stimuli, which is due to the presence of two pKa values afforded by the cation. The reported findings contribute to increase the customizability of double stimuli&#8208;responsive ABS based on ionic liquids, whose development was up to date limited to ionic liquids bearing pH&#8208;responsive anions, opening the door towards the development of more sustainable separation processes.</dc:description>

         <title>CoFe2O4 with the In&#8208;Situ Formed Oxygen Vacancies and Co Particles as an Efficient Bifunctional Catalyst for Rechargeable Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries (RZABs) are considered as one of the most promising clean energy device due to their abundant resources, low cost and environmental friendliness. However, their energy efficiency and cycle life are far from satisfactory due to the poor activity and stability of bi&#8208;functional electrocatalyst in air cathode. In this work, an efficient bi&#8208;functional catalyst (rGO&#8208;CoFe2O4/Co) was derived from its precursor (rGO&#8208;CoFe2O4) through a simple annealing process. Electrochemical measurements prove that rGO&#8208;CoFe2O4/Co with the in&#8208;situ formed Co nano particles and rich oxygen vacancies appears excellent oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction catalytic activity compared to its counterpart. Its half&#8208;wave potential is 0.81 V (vs RHE) and the OER overpotential is only 310 mV (vs RHE). In addition, rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries assembled with rGO&#8208;CoFe2O4/Co show the highest peak power density (128.9 mW cm&#8208;2) and cycling stability compared to rGO&#8208;CoFe2O4 and commercial Pt/C&#8208;RuO2 catalysts. This work provides a simple strategy for the design of advanced bifunctional catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Designing Artificial Laccase Catalysts by Introducing Substrate Oxidation Metals into Oxygen&#8208;Reducing Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Cu&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;67</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Laccase, a multi&#8208;copper oxidase, is limited by its optimal temperature range and isolation costs. To overcome these challenges, we synthesized copper&#8208;doped zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;67 (Cu&#8208;ZIF&#8208;67) with 16 mol% Cu as an artificial laccase catalyst. The introduced Cu site acts as the phenol oxidation site, and Co&#8208;based ZIF&#8208;67 is the four&#8208;electron oxygen reduction site. Laccase also employs this division of oxidation and reduction sites. Cu&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;67 demonstrated significant catalytic activity, superior to natural laccase, especially at elevated temperatures, and maintained stability across multiple reaction cycles. These findings suggest that Cu&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;67 is a robust, reusable alternative for industrial applications requiring high thermal stability and efficient catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Targeted and Untargeted Amine Metabolite Quantitation in Single Cells with Isobaric Multiplexing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We developed a single cell amine analysis approach utilizing isobarically multiplexed samples of 6 individual cells along with analyte abundant carrier. This methodology was applied for absolute quantitation of amino acids and untargeted relative quantitation of amines in a total of 108 individual cells using nanoflow LC with high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry. Together with individually determined cell sizes, this provides quantification of intracellular&#160;concentrations within individual cells. The targeted method was partially validated for 10 amino acids with limits of detection in low attomoles, linear calibration range covering analyte amounts typically from 30 amol to 120 fmol, and correlation coefficients (R) above 0.99. This was applied with cell sizes recorded during dispensing to determine millimolar intracellular amino acid concentrations. The untargeted approach yielded 249 features that were detected in at least 25% of the single cells, providing modest cell type separation on principal component analysis. Using Greedy forward selection with regularized least squares, a sub&#8208;selection of 100 features explaining most of the difference was determined. These features were annotated using MS2 from analyte standards and accurate mass with library search. The approach provides accessible, sensitive, and high&#8208;throughput method with the potential to be expanded also to other forms of ultrasensitive analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Zn Deposition Manner by Confining the Reactivity of Free Water in the Electric Double Layer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous Zn ion batteries (AZIBs) are promising candidates of next&#8208;generation energy storage devices with high safety and theoretical capacity. However, the irreversibility of metallic Zn anode, attributed to dendrite growth and water decomposition, severely limits the cycling durability of AZIBs and restricts their further development. Herein, a facile surface engineering strategy is put forward to tackle the issue of poor reversibility of the Zn anode. Benzotriazole (BTA) is employed as a functional additive of ZnSO4 electrolyte to confine the reactivity of free water situated in the electric double layer (EDL). Experimental results and theoretical simulation reveal that BTA can preferiencially adsorb onto the Zn surface to uniform Zn2+ ion distribution and alleviate H2O&#8208;involved side reactions like hydrogen evolution, and surface passivation. Consequently, in BTA&#8208;modulated aqueous electrolyte, the lifespan of the Zn anode is extended from 170 h to 1092 h at 1 mA cm&#8208;2/1 mAh cm&#8208;2. The reversibility improvement of Zn anode also benefits the cycling durability of full devices including supercapacitors and batteries. Zn||I&#8322; batteries assembled in as&#8208;designed electrolyte witness only 11.3% capacity decay over 17000 cycles at 1 A g&#8208;1, far outstripping that observed in ZnSO4 counterpart (~ 4675 cycles).</dc:description>

         <title>ACuGa6S10 (A = Rb, Cs): Design and Synthesis of Two New Cavity&#8208;Chalcopyrite Chalcogenides Based on "Iterative Substitution" Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two new non&#8208;centrosymmetric chalcogenides, ACuGa6S10 (A = Rb, Cs) have been successfully synthesized by an "iterative substitution" strategy based on chalcopyrite CuFeS2 structural template. Benefiting from the substitution of Fe3+ cations by Ga3+ cations, ACuGa6S10 (A = Rb, Cs) exhibit wide suitable band gap of 2.48 and 2.40 eV, respectively, which is about five times higher than their structure template CuFeS2, and the large second harmonic generation response (1.5 and 1.8 &#215; AgGaS2). Combining theoretical calculation and structural analysis confirm that the [GaS4] tetrahedra make the main contribution on their good liner and nonlinear optical (NLO) performances. The "iterative substitution" strategy expands the design idea of materials and can lead to the discovery of a large number of IR NLO compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic seawater splitting by Earth&#8208;abundant catalysts: metal&#8208;semiconductor metamaterials made of plasmonic magnesium diboride and transitional metal dichalcogenides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;semiconductor metamaterials hold great promise for photocatalytic water splitting due to their excellent light harvesting in a broad spectral range as well as efficient charge carrier generation and transfer. In majority of such metamaterials, semiconductors are used to initiate the water splitting reaction, while their metal counterparts are employed to improve light harvesting through plasmonic effects. Here, we describe for the first time an exceptional reversed case of metal&#8208;semiconductor photocatalysts in which metals are used to initiate the water splitting reaction and semiconductors are employed to improve light harvesting through blackbody effect and serve as co&#8208;catalysts. The studied photoanodes are made of non&#8208;noble plasmonic MgB2 combined with transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). The plasmonic resonances of the MgB2 component contribute to field confinement, plasmon&#8211;exciton coupling, and hot&#8208;electron transfer providing an enhancement of photoactivity in the entire solar spectrum capable of water splitting. The TMDC component provides impedance matching and enhances light absorption by the metal catalyst. We demonstrate seawater splitting with MgB2&#8208;TMDCs photoanodes attaining current densities of ~ 3 mA&#8901;cm&#8208;2 at solar radiation. The overall efficiency of hydrogen production in seawater splitting by sunlight with the help of the studied photoanodes is 3% at bias voltage of Vbias = 0.3 V.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable Cu (I) Complexes for Intracellular Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Azide Alkyne Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) has heralded a new era of chemical biology and biomedicine. However, caveats of CuAAC include formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and other copper&#8208;related toxicity. This limits utility in sensitive biological samples and matrices. Towards addressing these caveats, we synthesized and fully characterized two air and water stable trinuclear Cu (I) dimer complexes. The complexes were stable to oxidation in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, acid, base, and other chelators, which was reasoned to be due to the linear benzimidazole&#8208;Cu&#8208;benzimidazole geometry. Computational investigations of the catalytic cycle implicated two of the three coppers in the trimer complex as the active metal centers. The complexes were shown to catalyze the reaction at far below sub&#8208;toxic concentrations for intracellular click reactions to label triple negative breast cancer cells and compared to the current CuSO&#173;4&#8208;THPTA standard.</dc:description>

         <title>Adaptation of the BaAl4 Type to Small Cations: The Case of NaGa4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystal structure of NaGa4 presents a branch of the BaAl4 type characterized by an unusually large c/a ratio. This distortion allows the BaAl4 type to accommodate small cations, providing an alternative to the monoclinic distortion observed in the CaGa4 type.







Abstract
Single&#8208;phase NaGa4 samples were prepared by annealing stoichiometric element mixtures at 200&#8201;&#176;C, 300&#8201;&#176;C, and 450&#8201;&#176;C in closed tantalum ampoules. No compositional homogeneity range was detected. While single crystals annealed at 200&#8201;&#176;C feature a fully ordered crystal structure, a crystal annealed at 300&#8201;&#176;C reveals a defect with mutual exchange of Na atoms and Ga2 dumbbells. The structure motif caused by the violation of translational symmetry resembles the CeMg2Si2 type of structure. The NaGa4 structure constitutes a branch of the BaAl4 type distinguished by a notably high c/a ratio (space group I4/mmm; a=4.2261(1) &#197;, c=11.2633(6) &#197;, c/a=2.67). This distortion enables the adaption of the BaAl4&#8208;type to small cations, when the further shortening of the apical&#8211;apical distance d(Ga&#8211;Ga) is not possible any more. Therefore, NaGa4 offers an adaption alternative to the monoclinic distortion observed in CaGa4 and YbGa4. Conductivity measurements validate the metallic behavior anticipated by NMR measurements in earlier studies.

         <title>Networked Multicomponent Ensemble as AND Gate with FRET Output</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A networked supramolecular logic AND gate system is accomplished using precise chemical communication within a multicomponent ensemble via metal ion&#8208;driven self&#8208;sorting processes. The cybernetic AND gate is composed of a copper(I)&#8208;loaded nanoswitch, an aza&#8208;crown ether and a rhodamine receptor. The modus operandi of the AND gate, from state (0,0), was induced with stoichiometric amounts of two inputs (IN&#8208;1&#160;= Hg2+,&#160;IN&#8208;2&#160;= Li+) generating copper(I) ions as output only in state (1,1). Generation of state (1,1) from state (0,0) involves selective Cu+&#160;ion translocation from the nanoswitch to the aza&#8208;crown ether in the first step (IN&#8208;1) and then from the aza&#8208;crown ether to the rhodamine receptor in the second step (IN&#8208;2). The released copper(I) output acts as a messenger that binds to the rhodamine receptor, triggering it's spiro&#8208;lactam ring opening, which leads to a diagnostic FRET emission from the copper(I)&#8208;loaded Rhodamine scaffold accompanied by a remarkable fluorescence and colour change from pale yellow to pink.</dc:description>

         <title>Cleavage of a Peroxide Bond via a Dual Attack by Functional&#160;Mimics of Glutathione Peroxidase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nonmetal&#8208;containing peroxidase enzymes, including glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and peroxiredoxins, control cellular redox levels by catalyzing the reduction of H2O2. The remarkably higher reactivity of GPx enzyme as compared to the fully dissociated synthetic selenolate/thiolate molecule is probably due to the dual&#8208;attack on the peroxide bond (HO1&#8208;O2H) by the enzyme; The first one is a nucleophilic attack of the selenolate/thiolate moiety to O1 atom and the second attack at the O2 atom of the peroxide bond by the acidic &#8220;parked proton&#8221; from Trp or His residue present at the enzyme&#8217;s active site, leading to the facile cleavage of O&#8208;O bond. Herein, we report two synthetic compounds (1 and 2), having a selenolate (Se&#8722;) and a proton donor (imidazolium or &#8211;COOH group) moieties, which showed excellent GPx&#8208;like activity via dual&#8208;attack on the peroxide bond. The combined effect of selenolate moiety that donates electrons to the antibonding&#160;orbital of O1&#8208;O2 bond and the imidazolium or carboxylic acid moiety at the side chain that forms a strong H&#8208;bonding with the O2 atom facilitates O&#8208;O bond cleavage of H2O2 more efficiently. 1 and 2 exhibit remarkable ability in protecting Cu(I)&#8208;complex [TpmCu(CH3CN)]+ (9) against H2O2 by acting as a sacrificial antioxidant, thereby preventing metal&#8208;mediated ROS production.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating solvated sheath with anion chelant enables 4.6 V ultra&#8208;stable commercial LiCoO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Increasing cut&#8208;off voltage of lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) (&gt; 4.6 V) is an effective strategy to satisfy the ever&#8208;increasing demand for high energy density. However, the irreversible phase transition significantly destroys the structure of high&#8208;voltage LCO, especially the surface lattice. Considering that the structural stability of LCO is primarily dominated by the intrinsic merits of electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface (EEI), we explored and disclosed the operating mechanism of anion chelating agent tris(pentafluorophenyl) borane (TPFPB) and regulate the CEI layer on LCO electrode. Benefiting from the high HOMO energy level and preferential decomposition of TPFPB&#8208;PF6&#8722;, a robust LiF&#8208;rich CEI layer is constructed and greatly improves the stability of electrode/electrolyte interface. The well&#8208;designed electrolyte composed of 1 mol L&#8208;1 LiPF6 in EC/EMC with TPFPB additives endows Li/LCO half cells and 4 Ah Gr/LCO pouch cell with enhanced cycling stability under a high voltage condition. This work provides pave a new direction for the development of economical high&#8208;voltage LIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Diels&#8208;Alder Reactivity of Triisopropylsilyl Ethynyl Substituted Acenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We investigated the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of 6,13&#8208;bis(triisopropylsilyl)pentacene (1) with small dienophiles such as (bridged) dihydronaphthalenes/cyclohexenes that yielded adducts at the central ring, the other dienophiles predominantly or exclusively attacked the unsubstituted off&#8208;center ring. The difference in regioselectivity was investigated by DFT calculations. Apart from dispersion interactions, it is due to the steric demand of the dienophiles, which need to fit in between the silylethynyl substituents to react at the central ring. Epoxynaphthalene adducts of 1 as well as its anthracene and tetracene congeners were deoxygenated, easily furnishing triarenobarrelenes with TIPS&#8208;ethynyl substituents at the bridge heads, attractive building blocks for porous solids and higher acene&#8208;based trimers.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective H/D Exchange Based on Reversible C&#8208;H Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the increasing use of copper in C&#8208;H functionalizations, the Cu&#8208;catalyzed direct deuteration of C&#8208;H bonds remains a significant challenge due to its inherent low reactivity in inverse C&#8208;H bond reconstruction. In this paper, a novel strategy had been developed to reverse the copper&#8208;catalyzed concerted metalation&#8208;deprotonation process by inhibiting the unexpected disproportionation of Cu(II) to Cu(III). Picolinic acid was identified as a powerful ligand for facilitating this H/D exchange with D2O as deuterium source, and its inhibition activity was supported by preliminary control experiments and DFT studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Contorted Polycyclic Aromatic Compounds via Alkyne Benzannulation on Zigzag&#8208;Edged Dibenzochrysene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic dyes are interesting building blocks for the preparation of organic semiconductors as they possess synthetic handles that can be used to functionalize them and, consequently, change their electronic properties. However, reactions to extend their &#960;&#8208;conjugated framework through ring annulation have only been scarcely tested. Herein, we report the use of alkyne benzannulation on 2,8&#8208;dibromo&#8208;dibenzo[def,mno]chrysene (vat orange 3) and 2,9&#8208;dibromo&#8208;dibenzo[b,def]chrysene (vat orange 1) to extend the conjugation and reduce their bandgap. Unexpectedly, the ring closure reaction takes place at the most sterically hindered positions (peri to the substituent) to yield contorted polycyclic compounds. More surprisingly, both TIPS&#8208;acetylene&#8208;functionalized derivatives underwent a tandem dearomative spirocyclization to form bent polycyclic compounds. Absorption spectroscopy reveals that ring annulation on both 2,9&#8208;dibromo&#8208;dibenzo[b,def]chrysene and 2,8&#8208;dibromo&#8208;dibenzo[def,mno]chrysene resulted in a decrease of 0.38 and 0.12 eV in bandgap values, respectively, despite inducing a contorted conformation.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasonication is applied to aqueous Resorcinol&#8208;Formaldehyde Resin Nanoparticle&#8208;based bromine removal and upgraded applications, including silver recovery, MnO2&#8208;involved closed&#8208;loop material cycling, and battery electrode modification. With the benign and scalable acoustic boost, the efficiency of bromine fixation and related post&#8208;applications are significantly improved. The processes motivate the strategic design of water purification with high&#8208;safety and post&#8208;value&#8208;added utilizations.







Abstract
Bromine (Br2) and related species removal from water systems are rather complicated due to the complicated chemistry instability, and materials with high Br2 removal rate and efficiency, along with stimuli/apparatus suitable for highly corrosive environments, are necessary. Ultrasonication as a non&#8208;destructive process is especially suitable in scenarios where conventional stir apparatus is not applicable, such as highly corrosive environments. Considering the validity nature of Br2 and combining the advantages of ultrasonic with a highly stable Br2 fixation method through aromatic polymer nanoparticles, we demonstrate highly efficient acoustic&#8208;aided Br2 removal in aqueous solutions with two times capacity compared to the non&#8208;treated sample. Related aquatic applications are also proposed for the materials to be cost&#8208;effective, including silver (Ag) recovery, recyclable MnO2&#8208;mediated Br2 deep removal, and aqueous zinc anode modification. The coupled novel&#8208;material&#8208;based processes motivate the strategic design of water purification with high&#8208;safety and sustainable industrial procedures and post&#8208;value&#8208;added utilizations.

         <title>Discrete Macrocyclic Polymer Hosts&#8208;Induced Cascade Luminescence Enhancement and Application in Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of polymer, macrocycles and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) molecules brings infinite vitality to the construction of luminescent materials for bioimaging. Herein, we proposed discrete macrocyclic polymers hosts for assembling AIE molecules to induce cascade luminescence enhancement in water and to achieve desirable bioimaging performance via the cooperation of hydra&#8208;headed macrocycles containing two or three pillar[5]arene units, the block polymer F127 and AIE molecules.







Abstract
The integration of polymers, supramolecular macrocycles and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) molecules provides numerous possibilities for constructing various functional supramolecular systems. Herein, we constructed supramolecular assembled systems based on discrete macrocyclic polymer hosts via the cooperation of hydra&#8208;headed macrocycles containing two or three pillar[5]arene units (defined as P2, P3), the block polymer F127 and AIE molecules (alkyl&#8208;cyano modified tetraphenylethene, alkyl&#8208;triazole&#8208;cyano modified 9,10&#8208;distyrylanthracene, defined as TPE&#8208;(CN)4 and DSA&#8208;(TACN)2). Compared with the binary assembly between hydra&#8208;headed hosts or F127 and AIE molecules, cascaded supramolecular assembly&#8208;induced emission enhancement (SAIEE) in aqueous solution was achieved in discrete macrocyclic polymer&#8208;based supramolecular assembled systems. Considering the cascaded SAIEE performance, we have successfully applied discrete macrocyclic polymer&#8208;based supramolecular assembled systems to bioimaging and constructed an artificial light&#8208;harvesting system (LHs) to explore more potential applications. The supramolecular assembly form of discrete macrocyclic polymers hosts and AIE molecules proposed in this work provides new inspiration for the construction and application of high&#8208;performance supramolecular luminescent systems.

         <title>Photo&#8208;/Electrocatalytic Difunctionalization of Alkenes Enabled by C&#8722;H Radical Functionalization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in photo&#8208;/electocatalyzed alkene difunctionalization enabled by C&#8722;H radical functionalization are summarized, which are divided to four sections based on the final terminating step, including oxidative radical&#8208;polar crossover coupling, reductive radical&#8208;polar crossover coupling, radical&#8208;radical coupling and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed coupling, along with selected impressive synthetic examples to showcase the importance of the C&#8722;H radical functionalization&#8208;enabled alkene difunctionalization in synthesis.







Abstract
The difunctionalization of alkenes represents a powerful tool to incorporate two functional groups into the alkene bones for increasing molecular complexity and has been widely utilizations in chemical synthesis. Upon the catalysis of the green, sustainable, mild photo&#8208;/electrochemistry technologies, much attentions have been attracted to the development of new tactics for the transformations of the important alkene and alkane feedstocks driven by C&#8722;H radical functionalization. Herein, we summarize recent advances in the photo&#8208;/electrocatalytic difunctionalization of alkenes enabled by C&#8722;H radical functionalization. We detailedly discuss the substrate scope and the mechanisms of the photo&#8208;/electrocatalytic alkene difunctionalization reactions by selecting impressive synthetic examples, which are divided into four sections based on the final terminated step, including oxidative radical&#8208;polar crossover coupling, reductive radical&#8208;polar crossover coupling, radical&#8208;radical coupling, and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed coupling.

         <title>Non&#8208;Medical Applications of Inorganic Medicines. A Switch Based on Mechanistic Knowledge</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting from the description of integrated approaches for unveiling the molecular interactions underlying the biological effects of metallodrugs, through selected examples, it is highlighted how the obtained mechanistic information may turn relevant for the application of inorganic drugs in fields different from medicine.







Abstract
Metals have been used in medicine for centuries. However, it was not until much later that the effects of inorganic drugs could be rationalized from a mechanistic point of view. Today, thanks to the technologies available, this approach has been functionally developed and implemented. It has been found that there is probably no single biological target for the pharmacological effects of most inorganic drugs. Herein, we present an overview of some integrated and multi&#8208;technique approaches to elucidate the molecular interactions underlying the biological effects of metallodrugs. On this premise, selected examples are used to illustrate how the information obtained on metal&#8208;based drugs and their respective mechanisms can become relevant for applications in fields other than medicine. For example, some well&#8208;known metallodrugs, which have been shown to bind specific amino acid residues of proteins, can be used to solve problems related to protein structure elucidation in crystallographic studies. Diruthenium tetraacetate can be used to catalyze the conversion of hydroxylamines to nitrones with a high selectivity when bound to lysozyme. Finally, a case study is presented in which an unprecedented palladium/arsenic&#8208;mediated catalytic cycle for nitrile hydration was discovered thanks to previous studies on the solution chemistry of the anticancer compound arsenoplatin&#8208;1 (AP&#8208;1).

         <title>Neutral Adducts of Molybdenum Hexafluoride: Structure and Bonding in MoF6(NC5H5) and MoF6(NC5H5)2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molybdenum hexafluoride was shown to form Lewis acid base adduct with the organic base pyridine, the first neutral transition metal adducts beyond those of WF6. The MoF6(NC5H5) and MoF6(NC5H5)2 adducts adopt capped trigonal prismatic geometries. The trigonal prismatic MoF6 moiety in the adducts can be explained by the high electrostatic potentials of the square faces, where pyridine can coordinate.







Abstract
The first Lewis acid base adducts of MoF6 and an organic base have been synthesized, i.&#8201;e., MoF6(NC5H5) and MoF6(NC5H5)2. These adducts are structurally characterized with X&#8208;ray crystallography, showing that both adducts adopt capped trigonal prismatic structures. The MoF6(NC5H5) and MoF6(NC5H5)2 adducts are fluxional on the NMR time scale at room temperature. Two different fluorine environments could be resolved by 19F NMR spectroscopy at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C for the 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 adduct, MoF6(NC5H5)2, whereas MoF6(NC5H5) remains fluxional at that temperature. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations aide the assignment of the infrared and Raman spectra. Natural Bond Order and Molecular Electrostatic Potential analyses elucidate the structures and properties of the MoF6 pyridine adducts. Regions of significantly higher molecular electrostatic potential, i.&#8201;e., &#963;&#8208;holes, in trigonal prismatic compared to octahedral MoF6 rationalize the capped trigonal prismatic geometry of the adducts. Whereas MoF6(NC5H5) is stable at room temperature under exclusion of moisture, MoF6(NC5H5)2 decomposes at 60&#8201;&#176;C in pyridine solvent, and the solid slowly decomposes at room temperature after 24&#8197;h.

Two different fluorine environments could be resolved by &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F NMR spectroscopy at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C for the 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 adduct, MoF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(NC&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, whereas MoF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(NC&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) remains fluxional at that temperature. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations aide the assignment of the infrared and Raman spectra.

         <title>Cyanide Linkage Isomerization Induced by Cobalt Oxidation&#8208;State Changes at a Co&#8722;Fe Prussian&#8208;Blue Analogue/ZnO Interface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
VSFG spectroscopy in combination with electrochemistry reveals critical interplay between interfacial oxidation and cyanide flip in Co&#8722;Fe Prussian Blue/ZnO heterostructure. Tuning the fabrication temperature for such heterostructure gives access to an easily accessible approach for controlling interfacial composition. This work shows that co&#8208;operativity at the molecular level facilitate kinetically demanding chemical processes at such interfaces.







Abstract
Understanding the interfacial composition in heterostructures is crucial for tailoring heterogenous electrochemical and photoelectrochemical processes. This work aims to elucidate the structure of a series of Co&#8722;Fe Prussian blue analogue modified ZnO (PBA/ZnO) electrodes with interface&#8208;sensitive vibrational sum frequency generation (VSFG) spectroscopy. Our measurements revealed, for the first time, a cyanide linkage isomerism at the PBA/ZnO interface, when the composite is fabricated at elevated temperatures. In situ VSFG spectro&#8208;electrochemistry measurements correlate the CoII&#8594;CoIII oxidation with the flip of the bridging CN ligand from Co&#8722;NC&#8722;Fe coordination mode to a Co&#8722;CN&#8722;Fe one. Photoluminescence measurements and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal that this unprecedented linkage isomerism originates from surface defects, which act as oxidation sites for the PBA. The presence of such surface defects is correlated with the fabrication temperature for PBA/ZnO. Thus, this contribution identifies the interplay between the surface states of the ZnO substrates and the chemical composition of PBA at the ZnO surface, suggesting an easily accessible approach to control the chemical composition of the interface.

         <title>Enhanced Photodynamic Therapy for Neurodegenerative Diseases: Development of Azobenzene&#8208;Spiropyran@Gold Nanoparticles for Controlled Singlet Oxygen Generation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A groundbreaking nano&#8208;photosensitizer: a core&#8208;shell merocyanine&#8208;azobenzene on gold nanoparticles. This cutting&#8208;edge technology demonstrates remarkable efficacy in generating singlet oxygen. With its long&#8208;lasting stability and enhanced biocompatibility, it holds immense potential for advancing phototherapy in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.







Abstract
The development of durable photosensitizers is pivotal for advancing phototherapeutic applications in biomedicine. Here, we introduce a core&#8208;shell azobenzene&#8208;spiropyran structure on gold nanoparticles, engineered to enhance singlet oxygen generation. These nano&#8208;photosensitizers exhibit increased structural stability and thermal resistance, as demonstrated by slowed O&#8722;N&#8722;C bond recombination dynamics via in&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy. Notably, the in&#8208;situ formation of merocyanine and a light&#8208;induced compact shell arrangement extend its half&#8208;life from 47&#8197;minutes to over 154&#8197;hours, significantly boosting singlet oxygen output. The nano&#8208;photosensitizer also shows high biocompatibility and notably inhibits tau protein aggregation in neural cells, even with phosphatase inhibitors. Further, it promotes dendritic growth in neuro cells, doubling typical lengths. This work not only advances chemical nanotechnology but also sets a foundation for developing long&#8208;lasting phototherapy agents for treating neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>Interrogating Explicit Solvent Effects on the Mechanism and Site&#8208;Selectivity of Aryl Halide Oxidative Addition to L2Pd(0)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvent identity influences the rate and site&#8208;selectivity of (hetero)aryl (pseudo)halide oxidative addition to Pd(PCy3)2 in several ways. Substrates with H&#8208;bond donating groups are deactivated in polar solvents with high solvent hydrogen bonding basicity, whereas electron deficient substrates and aryl triflates undergo faster oxidative addition in more polar solvents.







Abstract
We report a study of solvent effects on the rate, selectivity, and mechanism of (hetero)aryl (pseudo)halide oxidative addition to Pd(PCy3)2 as an exemplar of L2Pd(0) species. First, 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;3&#8208;aminopyridine is observed to undergo faster oxidative addition in toluene compared to more polar solvents, which is not consistent with the trend we observe with many other 2&#8208;halopyridines. We attribute this to solvent basicity hydrogen bonding between solvent and substrate. Greater hydrogen bond donation from the substrate leads to a more electron&#8208;rich aromatic system, and therefore slower oxidative addition. We demonstrate how this affects rate and site&#8208;selectivity for hydrogen bond donating substrates. Second, electron&#8208;deficient multihalogenated pyridines exhibit improved site&#8208;selectivity in polar solvents, which we attribute to different C&#8722;X sites undergoing oxidative addition by two different mechanisms. The C&#8722;X site that favours the more polar nucleophilic displacement transition state is preferred over the site that favours a less&#8208;polar 3&#8208;centered transition state. Finally, (hetero)aryl triflates consistently undergo faster oxidative addition in more polar solvents, which we attribute to highly polar nucleophilic displacement transition states. This leads to improved site&#8208;selectivity for C&#8722;OTf oxidative addition, even in the presence of highly reactive 2&#8208;pyridyl halides.

Indolizines are important N&#8208;fused heterocycles which exist widely in natural products, pharmaceuticals, and organic optoelectronic materials. In this communication, A base promoted oxidative [4+2] annulation of pyrrole&#8208;2&#8208;carbaldehyde derivatives with o&#8208;hydroxyphenyl propargylamines for the synthesis of highly substituted indolizines has been developed. Using DBN as base, a broad range of 5,6,7&#8208;trisubstituted indolizines have been prepared in good to excellent yields under mild conditions, and many useful functional groups can be tolerated.

Due to the increasing interest in halo compounds in chemotherapy and protein modification/targeting in chiral bioenvironments, controlling the halogenation stereoselectivity is state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art science. Halogenation of carbamoyl group (&#8722;NHC=O) has never been mechanistically studied. Herein, we dive into depths of regioselectivity and stereoselectivity, provide the first comprehensive mechanism highlighting the selectivity&#8208;limiting factors and provide subsequent inspirations to control the (E/Z)&#8208;stereochemical output and insights into multidisciplinary applications.







Abstract
Organic halogen compounds are cornerstones of applied chemical sciences. Halogen substitution is a smart molecular design strategy adopted to influence reactivity, membrane permeability and receptor interaction. Chiral bioreceptors may restrict the stereochemical requirements in the halo&#8208;ligand design. Straightforward (but expensive) catalyzed stereospecific halogenation has been reported. Historically, PCl5 served access to uncatalyzed stereoselective chlorination although the stereochemical outcomes were influenced by steric parameters. Nonetheless, stereochemical investigation of PCl5 reaction mechanism with carbamoyl (RCONHX) compounds has never been addressed. Herein, we provide the first comprehensive stereochemical mechanistic explanation outlining halogenation of carbamoyl compounds with PCl5; the key regioselectivity&#8208;limiting nitrilimine intermediate (8&#8208;Z.HCl); how substitution pattern influences regioselectivity; why oxadiazole byproduct (P1) is encountered; stereo&#8208;electronic factors influencing the hydrazonoyl chloride (P2) production; and discovery of two stereoselectivity&#8208;limiting parallel mechanisms (stepwise and concerted) of elimination of HCl and POCl3. DFT calculations, synthetic methodology optimization, X&#8208;ray evidence and experimental reaction kinetics study evidence all supported the suggested mechanism proposal (Scheme&#8197;2). Finally, we provide mechanism&#8208;inspired future recommendations for directing the reaction stereoselectivity toward elusive and stereochemically inaccessible (E)&#8208;bis&#8208;hydrazonoyl chlorides along with potentially pivotal applications of both (E/Z)&#8208;stereoisomers especially in medicinal chemistry and protein modification.

         <title>Ferrocenyl Dithiophosphonate Ag(I) Complexes: Synthesis, Structures, Luminescence, and Electrocatalytic Water Splitting Tuned by Nuclearity and Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of heterometallic mono&#8208; and di&#8208;nuclear Ag(I) ferrocenyl dithiophosphonates with various alkyl chains were characterized, and fluorescence emission at RT was detected for the first time with effective quantum yields. The HER activity reveals the impact of metallic nuclearity and peripheral ligand engineering. The electrolytic results with the proposed mechanism were supported by the DFT study and established a link between molecular structures and their physical and HER catalytic properties, advancing the field of renewable energy resources.







Abstract
The heterometallic [Ag(I)/Fe(II)] molecular electrocatalysts for hydrogen production were introduced here to recognize the mutual role of metallic nuclearity and ligand engineering. A series of ferrocenyl dithiophosphonate stabilized mononuclear [Ag(PPh3)2{S2PFc(OR)}] {where R=Me (1), Et (2), nPr (3), iPr (4), iAmyl (5); Fc=Fe (&#627;5&#8208;C5H4) (&#627;5&#8208;C5H5)} and dinuclear [Ag(PPh3){S2PFc(OR}]2 {where R=Et (2&#8201;a), and nPr (3&#8201;a)} complexes were synthesized and characterized by SCXRD, NMR (31P and 1H), ESI&#8208;MS, UV&#8208;Vis, and FT&#8208;IR spectroscopy. The comparative electrocatalytic HER behavior of 1&#8211;5 and 2&#8201;a&#8211;3&#8201;a showed effective current density of 1&#8197;mA/cm2 with overpotentials ranging from 772 to 991&#8197;mV, demonstrating the influence of extended and branched carbon chains in dithiophosphonates and metallic (mono&#8208;/di&#8722;) nuclearity, which correlates with documented tetra&#8208;nuclear [Ag4(S2PFc(OnPr)4], 6. DFT study suggests the coordinated (&#956;1&#8208;S) site of ligands is the reactivity center and the adsorption energy of intermediate [H*&#8208;SM] varies with the engineering of ligand and nuclearity. A catalytic mechanism using mononuclear (1) and di&#8208;nuclear (2&#8201;a) was proposed with the assistance of DFT. Each complex, being the first example of Ag(I) dithiophosphonates, exhibits intense photoluminescence with high quantum yields ranging from 33&#8201;% to 67&#8201;%. These results link the lower nuclearity structures to their physical and catalytic properties.

         <title>Development of Low&#8208;Toxicity Antimicrobial Polycarbonates Bearing Lysine Residues.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The broad&#8208;spectrum antimicrobial polycarbonates bearing natural amino acid residues are easy to synthesize and scale up cost&#8208;efficiently. Together with their good biocompatibility, these polymers show great potential as a new class of antibacterial biomaterials to treat bacterial infections and combat emerging antibiotic resistance.







Abstract
Antibiotic resistance has been threatening public health for a long period, while the COVID pandemic aggravated the scenario. To combat antibiotic resistance strains, host defense peptides (HDPs) mimicking molecules have attracted considerable attention. Herein, we reported a series of polycarbonates bearing cationic lysine amino acid residues that could mimic the mechanism of action of HDPs and possess broad&#8208;spectrum antimicrobial activity. Moreover, those polymers had negligible toxicity toward red blood cells and mammalian cells. The membrane&#8208;disruption mechanism endows the lysine&#8208;containing polycarbonates with low possibility of resistance development and the fast killing kinetics, making them promising candidates for antimicrobial development.

         <title>Quantum Information Patterns Between Atoms in a Molecule</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atoms in a molecule are conceptual open quantum systems that exchange information. Quantifying that information allows for the characterization of such quantum atoms and how they interact with their molecular environment.







Abstract
Quantum information theory provides a powerful toolbox of descriptors that characterize many&#8208;electron systems based on quantum information patterns between open quantum systems. Despite the wealth of insights gained in the condensed matter community, the use of these descriptors to study interactions between atoms in a molecule remains limited. In this study, we develop a quantum information framework for molecules that characterizes the quantum information patterns between quantum atoms as defined in the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules. We show that quantum information analyses capture key properties of quantum atoms and how they interact with their molecular environment. Additionally, we show that the presence of bond critical points can remain invariant despite large changes in the quantum information patterns between the quantum atoms. Our findings indicate that quantum information theory can shed a new light on molecular electronic structure.

         <title>Visible Light Promoted de Mayo Type Reaction of Bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first de Mayo&#8208;type reaction of bicyclobutanes has been successfully achieved via triplet energy transfer photocatalysis. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the reaction proceeds through a [2&#960;+2&#963;]&#8208;retro&#8208;aldol cascade, culminating in syn&#8208;specific difunctionalization butanes.







Abstract
We reported herein a visible light mediated de Mayo&#8208;type reaction between 1,3&#8208;diketones and BCB. The reaction proceeds through a [2&#960;+2&#963;] cycloaddition and retro&#8208;aldol sequence, producing cis&#8208;difunctionalized cyclobutanes in high yields with good regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity.

         <title>Double Chalcogen Bonding Recognition Arrays in Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work focused on the dimerization of newly synthetized Pyrselen derivatives, being evaluated both at the solid state (by XRD analysis) and in solution, by 77Se NMR dilution experiments carried out in CDCl3 at 298&#8197;K. Notably, the self&#8208;assembly at the liquid state is persistently observed in different solvents, highlighting the charge&#8208;transfer contribution of this interaction.







Abstract
N&#8208;substituted pyridino&#8208;based congeners of Ebselen, named here as Pyrselen, incorporating proximal Se and N atoms, undergo dimerization in solution and the solid state through a dual donor&#8208;acceptor arrangement of chalcogen bonding sites. Dimerization constants were measured within the 5&#8211;50&#8197;M&#8722;1 range. Computational studies on the dimers depict a notable charge&#8208;transfer contribution to the association, validating Pyrselen as an effective scaffold for designing chalcogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;based recognition motifs.

         <title>Heterometallic&#8208;Organic Cages with Customized Cavities: Constructed by Bottom&#8208;Up Step&#8208;Wise Coordination&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Assembly</title>

         <dc:description>
Three heterometallic&#8208;organic cages with customized size and cavity have been precisely constructed using bottom&#8208;up step&#8208;wise coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly strategy. First, three Ru2+&#8208;connected dendritic ligands were synthesized from initial tripodal building blocks. Then, further self&#8208;assembly of metal&#8208;organic ligands with Fe2+ quantitatively generate the desired tetrahedral cages, respectively.







Abstract
Accurately synthesizing coordination&#8208;driven metal&#8208;organic cages with customized shape and cavity remains a great challenge for chemists. In this work, a bottom&#8208;up step&#8208;wise coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly approach was put forward. Employing this strategy, three terpyridyl heterometallic&#8208;organic truncated tetrahedral cages with different sizes and cavity were precisely synthesized. Firstly, the coordination of tripodal organic ligands with Ru2+ afforded dendritic metal&#8208;organic ligands L1&#8208;L3. Then the Ru building blocks complexed with Fe2+ and shrunk to form the desired heterometallic&#8208;organic cages (C1&#8208;C3). These discrete heterometallic&#8208;organic supramolecular cages were fully characterized and displayed the large and open cavities varied from 7205&#8197;&#197;3 to 9384&#8197;&#197;3. Notably, these cages could not be directly constructed by single&#8208;step assembly process using initial organic ligands or dimeric metal&#8208;organic ligands, indicative of the irreplaceability of a bottom&#8208;up step&#8208;wise assembly strategy for size&#8208;customized architectures. This work paves a new way for precisely constructing metal&#8208;organic cages with well&#8208;defined cavities.

         <title>Fast and Efficient Sensing of Drugs in Water Using Self&#8208;Assembling D&#8208;Glucamine&#8208;Functionalized Naphthalenediimide and 1,8&#8208;Naphthalimide Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We employed two self&#8208;assembling fluorophores functionalized with D&#8208;Glucamine, as fluorescent sensors for emerging pollutants in water, such as drugs, belonging to different classes and differing significantly in structure.







Abstract
Fast and sensitive quantification of drugs as emerging pollutants in water bodies is a pressing need in contemporary society, to prevent serious environmental concerns that could negatively impact on human health. This explains the surge of interest in this field, and the need to identify highly selective sensing systems. Addressing this issue, in this work we synthesized two D&#8208;glucamine functionalized fluorophores bearing self&#8208;assembling cores, as 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide and naphthalene diimide. We studied their self&#8208;assembly in water solution, and characterized the aggregated formed by determining their stability constant, their morphology and size by scanning electron microscopy, resonance light scattering and dynamic light scattering, as well their solid&#8208;state emission ability. Then, we studied their sensing ability, in water, towards pharmaceutically active compounds such as ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, carbamazepine and diclofenac sodium salt, by fluorescence investigation. Data collected show that the self&#8208;assembling ability is significantly affected by the fluorophore structure, which in turn also determines sensing ability. In particular, the naphtalene diimide&#8208;based probe was the most sensitive, with LOD as low as 0.01&#8197;&#956;M in the presence of nalidixic acid, which is in line and competitive with more complex sensing systems, recently reported in the literature.

         <title>Access to Diverse Carbonyl Compounds by Catalyst&#8208;Free and Photoinduced Aerobic Cleavage of C=N Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalyst&#8208;free and photoinduced aerobic cleavage of C=N bonds has been developed using oxygen from air as green oxidant. This strategy features broad substrate scope and a series of carbonyl compounds including ketones, aldehydes, carboxylic acids and relative drug analogues were obtained. Moreover, the easy&#8208;operation and gram&#8208;scale synthesis indicates the practicality of this method.







Abstract
Functional group interconversion is of great significance in organic synthesis. However, aerobic cleavage of C=N bonds to access carbonyl compounds still suffered from some limitations such as harsh reaction conditions, stoichiometric oxidants, poor substrate scope and use of toxic reagents. Herein, we report a catalyst&#8208;free and photo&#8208;induced aerobic cleavage of C=N bonds to afford diverse carbonyl compounds using oxygen from air as green oxidant. This mild methodology permits N&#8208;tosylhydrazones converted into the corresponding carbonyl compounds including ketones, aldehydes and carboxylic acids, showing broad functional group tolerance and compatibility. Moreover, the gram&#8208;scale reaction and post&#8208;modification of complicated molecules proved the applicability and efficiency of this strategy. Finally, a plausible mechanism was proposed based on spectroscopic investigations and detailed mechanistic studies.

         <title>THz&#8208;EPR&#8208;based Magneto&#8208;Structural Correlations for Cobalt(II) Single&#8208;Ion Magnets With Bis&#8208;Chelate Coordination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An experimental basis for understanding the structure&#8208;property relationships for tetrahedrally coordinated cobalt&#8208;based single&#8208;ion magnets is derived from precise zero&#8208;field splitting energies directly obtained by THz&#8208;EPR spectroscopy. A large elongation increases the magnetization barrier, while twisting of the chelate planes increases rhombicity and thus promotes relaxation by undesired quantum tunneling processes.







Abstract
New cobalt(II)&#8208;based complexes with [N2O2] coordination formed by two bis&#8208;chelate ligands were synthesized and characterized by a multi&#8208;technique approach. The complexes possess an easy&#8208;axis anisotropy (D&lt;0) and magnetic measurements show a field&#8208;induced slow relaxation of magnetization. The spin&#8208;reversal barriers, i.&#8201;e., the splitting of the two lowest Kramers doublets (UZFS), have been measured by THz&#8208;EPR spectroscopy, which allows to distinguish the two crystallographically independent species present in one of the complexes. Based on these experimental UZFS energies together with those for related complexes reported in literature, it was possible to establish magneto&#8208;structural correlations. UZFS linearly depends on the elongation parameter &#1013;T of the (pseudo&#8208;)tetrahedral coordination, which is given by the ratio between the average obtuse and acute angles at the cobalt(II) ion, while UZFS was found to be virtually independent of the twist angle of the chelate planes. With increasing deviation from the orthogonality of the latter, the rhombicity (|E/D|) increases.

         <title>Eludicating Heavy&#8208;Atom&#8208;Tunneling Kinetics in the Cope Rearrangement of Semibullvalene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
When heavy atom tunneling regime is attained, the free energy reaction profile tunnels below the potential energy profile due to the inclusion of nuclear quantum effects. Ring Polymer Molecular Dynamics simulations are able to provide free energy and rate constants describing this phenomenon. Here we use the Cope's rearrangement of semibullvalene as prototypical reaction.







Abstract
In this work, we characterize the temperature dependence of kinetic properties in heavy atom tunneling reactions by means of molecular dynamics simulations, including nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) via Path Integral theory. To this end, we consider the prototypical Cope rearrangement of semibullvalene. The reaction was studied in the 25&#8211;300&#8197;K temperature range observing that the inclusion of NQEs modifies the temperature behavior of both free energy barriers and dynamical recrossing factors with respect to classical dynamics. Notably, while in classical simulations the activation free energy shows a very weak temperature dependence, it becomes strongly dependent on temperature when NQEs are included. This temperature behavior shows a transition from a regime where the quantum effects are limited and can mainly be traced back to zero point energy, to a low temperature regime where tunneling plays a dominant role. In this regime, the free energy curve tunnels below the potential energy barrier along the reaction coordinate, allowing much faster reaction rates. Finally, the temperature dependence of the rate constants obtained from molecular dynamics simulations was compared with available experimental data and with semi&#8208;classical transition state theory calculations, showing comparable behaviors and similar transition temperatures from thermal to (deep) tunneling regime.

A series of CTFs decorated with different substituents (H, MeO, and F) were synthesized, and they were effective photocatalysts for C&#8722;H activation due to their unique structures and optoelectronic properties. Methoxy&#8208;substituted CTF (MeO&#8208;CTF) exhibited extraordinary catalytic performance and reusability in C&#8722;H functionalization by constructing an electronic donor&#8208;acceptor system, achieving the highest yield in the photocatalytic C3&#8208;H hydroxylation of 2&#8208;phenylimidazole[1,2&#8208;&#945;]pyridine.







Abstract
Covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) are promising heterogeneous photocatalyst candidates owing to their excellent stability, conjugacy, and tunability. In this study, a series of CTFs decorated with different substituents (H, MeO, and F) were synthesised and utilised as photocatalysts for C&#8722;H activation reactions. The corresponding optoelectronic properties could be precisely regulated by the electronic effects of different substituents in the nanopore channels of the CTFs; these CTFs were effective photocatalysts for C&#8722;H activation in organic synthesis due to their unique structures and optoelectronic properties. Methoxy&#8208;substituted CTF (MeO&#8208;CTF) exhibited extraordinary catalytic performance and reusability in C&#8722;H functionalization by constructing an electronic donor&#8208;acceptor system, achieving the highest yield in the photocatalytic C3&#8211;H hydroxylation of 2&#8208;phenylimidazole[1,2&#8208;&#945;]pyridine. This strategy provides a new scaffold for the rational design of CTFs as efficient photocatalysts for organic synthesis.

         <title>Structure Elucidation of Pharmaceutically Relevant Compounds Within Pyrene&#8208;Based Frameworks</title>

Using the predictable packing arrangement of guanidinium organosulfonate with a pyrene core a host of different small molecules can be encapsulated and their structures elucidated.







Abstract
Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) is the preferred and most accurate technique for determining molecular structures. However, it can present challenges when dealing with specific small molecules and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), as many do not form quality crystals without coformers or can be unstable. In this study, we introduce tetrakis(guanidinium) pyrenetetrasulfonate (G4PYR), a robust guanidinium&#8208;organosulfonate (GS) framework that efficiently encapsulates small molecules and APIs rich in functional groups. The hydrogen bonding frameworks formed by G4PYR display well&#8208;ordered structures with predictable pyrene&#8208;pyrene distances, making them ideally suited for targeting arene&#8208;based APIs with pendant groups. Successful encapsulation of various guests, including benzaldehyde, benzamide, and arenes containing multiple hydrogen bond donors and acceptors like uracil and thymine, was achieved. Furthermore, we successfully encapsulated important pharmaceutical and biologically relevant compounds, such as lidocaine, ropinirole, adenosine, thymidine, and others. Notably, we present a workflow for investigating host&#8208;guest complex formation using powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and high throughput experimentation.

         <title>Recent Advances in DNA&#8208;Based Nanoprobes for In vivo MiRNA Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept review summarizes signal amplification strategies including DNAzyme catalytic reaction, hybrid chain reaction (HCR), catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) to enhance detection signal of lowly expressed miRNAs; external stimuli and internal stimuli to prevent nonspecific activation; and the development of NIR&#8208;II fluorescent probes for in&#8197;vivo miRNA imaging and indicated current challenges for in&#8197;vivo miRNA imaging.







Abstract
As a post transcriptional regulator of gene expression, microRNAs (miRNA) is closely related to many major human diseases, especially cancer. Therefore, its precise detection is very important for disease diagnosis and treatment. With the advancement of fluorescent dye and imaging technology, the focus has shifted from in&#8197;vitro miRNA detection to in&#8197;vivo miRNA imaging. This concept review summarizes signal amplification strategies including DNAzyme catalytic reaction, hybrid chain reaction (HCR), catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) to enhance detection signal of lowly expressed miRNAs; external stimuli of ultraviolet (UV) light or near&#8208;infrared region (NIR) light, and internal stimuli such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), glutathione (GSH), protease and cell membrane protein to prevent nonspecific activation for the avoidance of false positive signal; and the development of fluorescent probes with emission in NIR for in&#8197;vivo miRNA imaging; as well as rare earth nanoparticle based the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) nanoprobes with excellent tissue penetration and depth for in&#8197;vivo miRNA imaging. The concept review also indicated current challenges for in&#8197;vivo miRNA imaging including the dynamic monitoring of miRNA expression change and simultaneous in&#8197;vivo imaging of multiple miRNAs.

         <title>A Two&#8208;Step Intermolecular Interaction Of Molecular Macroions With Multivalent Counterions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular cluster U60 macroion exhibits a very different solution behavior depending on the valences of added counterions. When multivalent counterions are introduced, unlike monovalent counterions, there is an additional step for the macroion&#8208;counterion interaction. The two&#8208;step mechanism can be nicely correlated to the microscopic (self&#8208;assembly) and macroscopic (gelation) phase transitions observed in the macroionic aqueous systems.







Abstract
Macroion&#8208;counterion interaction is essential for regulating the solution behaviors of hydrophilic macroions, as simple models for polyelectrolytes. Here, we explore the interaction between uranyl peroxide molecular cluster Li68K12(OH)20[UO2(O2)OH]60 (U60) and multivalent counterions. Different from interaction with monovalent counterions that shows a simple one&#8208;step process, isothermal titration calorimetry, combined with light/X&#8208;ray scattering measurements and electron microscopy, confirm a two&#8208;step process for their interaction with multivalent counterions: an ion&#8208;pairing between U60 and the counterion with partial breakage of hydration shells followed by strong U60&#8208;U60 attraction, leading to the formation of large nanosheets with severe breakage and reconstruction of hydration shells. The detailed studies on macroion&#8208;counterion interaction can be nicely correlated to the microscopic (self&#8208;assembly) and macroscopic (gelation or phase separation) phase transitions in the dilute U60 aqueous solutions induced by multivalent counterions.

Different from interaction with monovalent counterions that shows a simple one-step process, isothermal titration calorimetry, combined with light/X-ray scattering measurements and electron microscopy, confirm a two-step process for their interaction with multivalent counterions: an ion-pairing between &lt;b&gt;U&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; and the counterion with partial breakage of hydration shells followed by strong &lt;b&gt;U&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;U&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; attraction, leading to the formation of large nanosheets with severe breakage and reconstruction of hydration shells. The detailed studies on macroion-counterion interaction can be nicely correlated to the microscopic (self-assembly) and macroscopic (gelation or phase separation) phase transitions in the dilute &lt;b&gt;U&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; aqueous solutions induced by multivalent counterions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual, Photo&#8208;Responsive and Redox&#8208;Active Supramolecular Foldamers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report on the development of novel dual light&#8208;responsive and redox&#8208;active foldamers that demonstrate multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive behaviour of the supramolecular scaffold and display low levels of operational fatigue upon cyclic treatments with light and oxidative/reductive conditions.







Abstract
We report on dual, light&#8208;responsive and redox&#8208;active foldamers that demonstrate reversible and robust stimuli&#8208;induced behaviour. Herein, UV/Vis, 1H NMR and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry have been used to establish the reversibility and highly robust nature of the light&#8208; and redox&#8208;driven behaviour of these new foldamers with minimal levels of fatigue observed even upon multiple cyclic treatments with irradiative/non&#8208;irradiative and oxidative/reductive conditions. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept work paves the way towards the creation of novel stimuli&#8208;responsive foldamers of increasing sophistication capable of demonstrating reversible and robust responses to multiple distinct stimuli.

         <title>Covalent Lysozyme Immobilization on Enzymatic Cellulose Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TEMPO&#8208;oxidized cellulose nanocrystals (TO&#8208;CNCs) are an excellent substrate for the covalent immobilization of lysozyme from chicken egg white. The bioconjugates are synthesized, isolated and characterized and are potential candidates as antibacterial materials.







Abstract
Nanostructured materials represent promising substrates for biocatalyst immobilization and activation. Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), accessible from waste and/or renewable sources, are sustainable and biodegradable, show high specific surface area for anchoring a high number of enzymatic units, and high thermal and mechanical stability. In this work, we present a holistic enzyme&#8208;based approach to functional antibacterial materials by bioconjugation between the lysozyme from chicken egg white and enzymatic cellulose nanocrystals. The neutral CNCs were prepared by endoglucanase hydrolysis from Avicel. We explore the covalent immobilization of lysozyme on enzymatic CNCs and on their TEMPO oxidized derivatives (TO&#8208;CNCs), comparing immobilization yields, material properties, and enzymatic activities. The materials were characterized by X&#8208;ray diffractometry (XRD), attenuated total reflectance Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;FTIR), bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay, field&#8208;emission scanning electron microscopy (FE&#8208;SEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). We demonstrate the higher overall efficiency of the immobilization process carried out on TO&#8208;CNCs, based on the success of covalent bonding and on the stability of the isolated bioconjugates.

         <title>Orthogonal Geometry Enhancing the Intersystem Crossing and Photosensitive Efficiency of Spiro Organoboron Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations are conducted to investigate the potential photosensitivity of spiro organoboron compounds. Geometric analysis reveals that the configuration of S1 determines the molecular ISC rate constants, and PSs with a (N, N) acceptor exhibit higher theoretical sensitization efficiency than those with a (N, O) acceptor, which is contributed by the donor&#8208;acceptor orthogonal feature.







Abstract
Based on the reported spiro organoboron compounds (PS1 and PS2 as potent 1O2 sensitizers), several new organoboron molecules (PS4&#8211;PS9) were constructed through structural modification, and their low&#8208;lying excited states and photophysical properties have been explored by density functional theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent DFT (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations. The predicted effective intersystem crossing (ISC) processes arise from the S1&#8594;T2 transition for PS4&#8211;PS6 and the S1&#8594;T4 transition for PS1, and corresponding KISC rate constants reach the order of magnitude of 109 (s&#8722;1). The organoboron compounds with a (N, N) chelate acceptor are predicted to exhibit relatively higher ISC efficiency than those bearing a (N, O) acceptor, and the planar C3NBN ring and the orthogonal configuration between the donor and acceptor moieties are responsible for the ISC rate enhancement. Importantly, the geometric features of the lowest singlet excited state (S1) for these compounds play a decisive role in their photosensitive efficiency. The present results provide a basis for better understanding of the photosensitivity of these spiro organoboron compounds and the structural modification effect.

         <title>Constructing Cyclic Hydrogen Bonding to Suppress Side Reactions and Dendrite Formation on Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;hydroxymethylacetamide additives in 2&#8197;M ZnSO4 electrolytes disrupt water molecule networks, inhibiting dendrite growth and improving zinc anode stability, while guiding uniform zinc deposition, significantly enhancing battery cycle life and Coulombic efficiency. This work underscores the potential of electrolyte additives to address critical limitations in zinc metal batteries.







Abstract
The high electrochemical reactivity of H2O molecules and zinc metal results in severe side reactions and dendrite formation on zinc anodes. Here we demonstrate that these issues can be addressed by using N&#8208;hydroxymethylacetamide (NHA) as additives in 2&#8197;M ZnSO4 electrolytes. The addition of NHA molecules, acting as both a hydrogen bond donor and acceptor, enables the formation of cyclic hydrogen bonding with H2O molecules. This interaction disrupts the existing hydrogen bonding networks between H2O molecules, hindering proton transport, and containing H2O molecules within the cyclic hydrogen bonding structure to prevent deprotonation. Additionally, NHA molecules show a preference for adsorption on the (101) crystal surface of zinc metal. This preferential adsorption reduces the surface energy of the (101) plane, facilitating the homogeneous Zn deposition along the (101) direction. Thus, the NHA enables Zn||Zn symmetric cell with a cycle lifespan of 1100&#8197;hours at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and Zn||Cu asymmetric cell with a high Coulombic efficiency over 99.5&#8201;%. Moreover, the NHA&#8208;modified Zn||AC zinc ion hybrid capacitor is capable of sustaining 15000 cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. This electrolyte additive engineering presents a promising strategy to enhance the performance and broaden the application potential of zinc metal&#8208;based energy storage devices.

         <title>Two&#8208;Coordinate Dinuclear Donor&#8208;Gold(I)&#8208;Acceptor Complexes Exhibiting Multiple Excitation Wavelength Dependent Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dinuclear donor&#8208;Au&#8208;acceptor complexes with intramolecular aurophilic interactions were synthesized. The increased metal contribution to the highest occupied molecular orbital enlarges S1&#8208;T1 energy gap, which disables the thermally activated delayed fluorescence. Moreover, unexpected excitation wavelength dependent multiple phosphorescence was observed, attributed to the poor internal conversion originating from the large energy separation and spatially isolated orbital between various excited states.







Abstract
Two&#8208;coordinate Au(I) complexes with a donor&#8208;metal&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;M&#8208;A) structure have shown rich luminescent properties. However, charge&#8208;neutral dinuclear donor&#8208;metal&#8208;acceptor type Au(I) complexes featuring aurophilic interactions have been seldom explored. Herein, we describe the structures and photoluminescence properties of two dinuclear Au(I) complexes, namely DiAu&#8208;Ph and DiAu&#8208;Me. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structural analysis of DiAu&#8208;Ph reveals a short intramolecular Au&#8208;Au distance of 3.224&#8197;&#197;. In dilute solution and doped films, excitation wavelength dependent multiple phosphorescence phenomena were observed for these dinuclear complexes. Theoretical calculations reveal that the aurophilic interaction causes increased contribution of the Au d orbital to the highest occupied molecular orbitals. Thus, the gap between singlet and triplet excited states (&#916;EST) is enlarged, which disables the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Moreover, the large energy separation (0.45&#8211;0.52&#8197;eV) and the different orbital configurations between the various excited states result in an inefficient internal conversion, accounting for their multiple phosphorescence properties.

     alt="Two-Coordinate Dinuclear Donor-Gold(I)-Acceptor Complexes Exhibiting Multiple Excitation Wavelength Dependent Phosphorescence"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dinuclear donor-Au-acceptor complexes with intramolecular aurophilic interactions were synthesized. The increased metal contribution to the highest occupied molecular orbital enlarges S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; energy gap, which disables the thermally activated delayed fluorescence. Moreover, unexpected excitation wavelength dependent multiple phosphorescence was observed, attributed to the poor internal conversion originating from the large energy separation and spatially isolated orbital between various excited states.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-coordinate Au(I) complexes with a donor-metal-acceptor (D-M-A) structure have shown rich luminescent properties. However, charge-neutral dinuclear donor-metal-acceptor type Au(I) complexes featuring aurophilic interactions have been seldom explored. Herein, we describe the structures and photoluminescence properties of two dinuclear Au(I) complexes, namely &lt;b&gt;DiAu-Ph&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;DiAu-Me&lt;/b&gt;. Single crystal X-ray structural analysis of &lt;b&gt;DiAu-Ph&lt;/b&gt; reveals a short intramolecular Au-Au distance of 3.224&#8197;&#197;. In dilute solution and doped films, excitation wavelength dependent multiple phosphorescence phenomena were observed for these dinuclear complexes. Theoretical calculations reveal that the aurophilic interaction causes increased contribution of the Au d orbital to the highest occupied molecular orbitals. Thus, the gap between singlet and triplet excited states (&#916;&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt;) is enlarged, which disables the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Moreover, the large energy separation (0.45&#8211;0.52&#8197;eV) and the different orbital configurations between the various excited states result in an inefficient internal conversion, accounting for their multiple phosphorescence properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Columnar Organization of Nonalternant Fluorinated Dehydrobenzannulenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
I'm still stacking! Partially fluorinated dehydrobenzannulene macrocycles have been synthesized using a combination of Pd&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira couplings and oxidative alkyne dimerizations. They stack into extended slipped columns despite their low symmetry which prevents full electronic self&#8208;complementarity. These stacking arrangements are mediated by slipped [&#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;] interactions between fluorinated arene rings and fluoroarene&#8208;arene short contacts. Computations suggest that this assembly is dispersion&#8208;driven.







Abstract
Two new partially fluorinated dehydrobenzannulenes have been prepared by inter&#8208; and intramolecular oxidative homocoupling of diyne precursors. These systems contain fluorinated and nonfluorinated arene rings in a desymmetrized non&#8208;alternant arrangement. Both macrocycles are roughly planar and organize into extended columns in the solid state. The assembly of these columns is mediated by the combination of dispersion interactions, slipped [&#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;] stacking interactions of the perfluorinated rings with each other, and their association with the nonfluorinated rings in the molecules of the neighboring macrocycles. These results suggest that partial fluorination of dehydrobenzannulenes can serve as a versatile motif for their assembly into columnar superstructures.

         <title>Twist along Central C&#8722;C Bonds in a Series of Fully &#960;&#8208;Fused Propellanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twist in a series of &#960;&#8208;fused propellanes is investigated by both theoretical and experimental methods. A biphenyl&#8208;fused [4.4.4]propellane gives D3&#8208;symmetric enantiomers stable at 146&#8201;&#176;C, whereas naphthalene&#8208;fused [3.3.3]propellane and [4.3.3]hybrid show non&#8208;twisted form and fast twist inversion at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C between (P/M)&#8208;conformations, respectively. The twist is correlated with large changes of NMR chemical shifts and other physical properties.







Abstract
Without stereogenic carbon centers, organic molecules can be chiral when they have large energy barriers for conformational inversion. In this work, conformational behaviors are investigated for a series of tricyclic propellane skeletons with increasing 6&#8208;membered&#8208;ring peripheral moieties fused with aromatic rings. According to theoretical calculations, trinaphtho[3.3.3]propellane has three vertical naphthalene rings like triptycene shape without torsion along the central C&#8722;C single bond. On the other hand, hexabenzo[4.4.4]propellane shows hexaphenylethane&#8208;like ca. 60&#176; twist along the bond with large activation energy of 64&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for twist inversion because of the high congestion caused by three 6&#8208;membered&#8208;ring loops. Indeed, the [4.4.4]propellane gives a stable pair of chiroptical enantiomers toward heating at 146&#8201;&#176;C. By contrast, a hybrid [4.3.3]propellane exhibits fast interconversion between two twisted conformations even at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Rational Design of Mesoporous ZnFe2O4@g&#8208;C3N4 Heterojunctions for Environmental Remediation and Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mesoporous magnetic nanocomposites (MNCs) comprising g&#8208;C3N4@ZnFe2O4, featuring tiny mesopores and effective heterojunctions, demonstrate superior catalytic performance for hydrogen evolution and dye degradation under solar illumination, with recyclability and easy separation using magnets.







Abstract
Mesoporous catalysts with a high specific surface area, accessible pore structures, and appropriate band edges are desirable for optimal charge transfer across the interfaces, suppress electron&#8208;hole recombination, and promote redox reactions at the active sites. The present study demonstrates the rational design of mesoporous ZnFe2O4@g&#8208;C3N4 magnetic nanocomposites (MNCs) with different pore sizes and pore volumes following a combination of facile thermal itching and thermal impregnation methods. The MNCs preserve the structural, morphological, and physical attributes of their counterparts while ensuring their effectiveness and superior catalytic capabilities. The morphological analysis confirms the successful grafting and confinement of ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles with the polymeric g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets to form heterojunctions with numerous interfaces. The MNCs possess uniformly distributed small mesopores (pore size &lt;4&#8197;nm), ample active sites, and a high specific surface area of 62.50&#8197;m2/g. The mesoporous ZnFe2O4@g&#8208;C3N4 notably improve hydrogen evolution rate and methylene blue dye degradation. The optimal loading weight of ZnFe2O4 is 20&#8201;%, in which the MNCs display the highest hydrogen evolution rate of 1752&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and photo&#8208;Fenton dye degradation rate constants of 0.147&#8197;min&#8722;1, upon solar&#8208;light illumination. Furthermore, the photocatalysts demonstrate recyclability over five consecutive cycles, confirming their stability, while easy separation using a simple magnet underscores practical utility.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Method for the Selective Synthesis of Amides and N&#8208;Acylureas from Carboxylic Acids and Thioureas</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the presence of a base and photocatalyst, thiourea undergoes deprotonation and a single&#8208;electron transfer process, subsequently leading to desulfurization and the formation of carbodiimide. Ultimately, the carboxylic acid reacts with carbodiimide, and can selectively produce amides and N&#8208;acylureas.







Abstract
In this work, we developed a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven method for the selective synthesis of amides and N&#8208;acylureas from carboxylic acids and thioureas. This protocol was featured as avoidance of additional oxidants and transition metal catalysts, simple manipulations, low cost, broad substrate scope, and good functional group tolerance. As only oxygen serves as the oxidation reagent, this method provides a promising synthesis candidate for the formation of N&#8208;aryl amides and N&#8208;acylureas, including late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex pharmaceutical molecules and biologically active molecules.

Abstract
Disclosed here is an efficient approach for the preparation of quinoxaline&#8208;2,3&#8208;diones using air (O2) as a green oxidant via acid&#8208;promoted self&#8208;photocatalyzed regioselective oxidation of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones at C&#8208;3 position. This protocol presents a novel synthetic route for the preparation of quinoxaline&#8208;2,3&#8208;dione derivatives, featuring mild reaction conditions, simple operation, and a wide range of substrates, without the need for external photocatalysts, metal reagents, and strong oxidants.

         <title>Lewis Acid Regulation Strategy for Constructing D&#8208;A&#8208;A Covalent Organic Frameworks with Enhanced Photocatalytic Organic Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of D&#8722;A&#8208;A COFs are constructed by a novel Lewis acid regulatory strategy. In here, Lewis acid sites can be used as electron acceptors to facilitate the separation and transfer of h+&#8722;e&#8722; pairs and further increase optoelectronic properties. Among them, PYBP&#8208;MgCl2&#8208;COF exhibited the best activity for the visible light&#8208;induced aerobic hydroxylation conversion of arylboronic acids with excellent yield and substrates compatibility.







Abstract
Owing to their excellent photoelectric properties, donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) type photocatalytic covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have attracted significant research interest in recent years. However, the limited D&#8722;A structural units of existing COFs restrict the development of novel and efficient photocatalytic COF materials. To solve this problem, we developed a series of D&#8722;A&#8208;A&#8208;type COFs utilizing a Lewis acid regulation strategy, in which Lewis acids act as the coordination centers, and pyridine and cyano groups act as ligands. Lewis acid sites in COFs serve as electron acceptors, facilitating the separation and transfer of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs. This process is crucial for photocatalysis because it significantly increases the efficiency of the catalytic reaction by reducing the recombination rate of charge carriers. The developed Lewis acid&#8208;activated D&#8722;A&#8208;A COFs efficiently catalyzed the hydroxylation of various phenylboronic acid compounds under visible light. The developed catalysts are expected to contribute to increasing the fabrication efficiency of industrially important organic materials.

A novel protocol for the efficient synthesis of benzofuro[3,2&#8208;d]pyrimidin&#8208;2&#8208;amines through a chemselective one&#8208;pot cascade [4+2] annulation/aromatization between benzofuran&#8208;derived azadienes and cyanamides has been described. The calculated studies well explained the chemoselectivity between carbodiimide anions and the isomerized cyanamide anions.







Abstract
The chemoselective [4+2] annulation/aromatization reactions between benzofuran&#8208;derived azadienes and N&#8722;Ts cyanamides are developed, affording a convenient method for synthesizing benzofuro[3,2&#8208;d]pyrimidin&#8208;2&#8208;amines under mild conditions. Herein, N&#8722;Ts cyanamides participated in reactions selectively via carbodiimide anion intermediates and the corresponding cyanamide anion intermediates derived products were not observed. The proposed chemoselective stepwise reaction mechanism was well supported by DFT calculations.

         <title>Harnessing Gene Editing Technology for Tumor Microenvironment Modulation: An Emerging Anticancer Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emergence of gene editing technologies, particularly the CRISPR&#8208;Cas system, offers promising new strategies for the cancer treatment. Benefiting from nanomaterial strategies, the limitations of CRISPR&#8208;Cas system for in&#8197;vivo application are dramatically improved and can effectively regulate the tumor microenvironment, which provides a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art avenue for tumor therapy.







Abstract
Cancer is a multifaceted disease influenced by both intrinsic cellular traits and extrinsic factors, with the tumor microenvironment (TME) being crucial for cancer progression. To satisfy their high proliferation and aggressiveness, cancer cells always plunder large amounts of nutrients and release various signals to their surroundings, forming a dynamic TME with special metabolic, immune, microbial and physical characteristics. Due to the neglect of interactions between tumor cells and the TME, traditional cancer therapies often struggle with challenges such as drug resistance, low efficacy, and recurrence. Importantly, the development of gene editing technologies, particularly the CRISPR&#8208;Cas system, offers promising new strategies for cancer treatment. Combined with nanomaterial strategies, CRISPR&#8208;Cas technology exhibits precision, affordability, and user&#8208;friendliness with reduced side effects, which holds great promise for profoundly altering the TME at the genetic level, potentially leading to lasting anticancer outcomes. This review will delve into how CRISPR&#8208;Cas can be leveraged to manipulate the TME, examining its potential as a transformative anticancer therapy.

         <title>Computational Design of 3D Lantern Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a computational design of a new 3D Lantern Organic Framework&#8208;(LOFs) materials by using trisilasumanene and porphyrin&#8208;cored bases. Using Density Functional Theory shows that HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps of these 3D&#8208;LOFs are mainly determined by the base units, with minimal impact from vertical stacking via sp3&#8208;hydrocarbon bridges on such a property. Consequently, 3D&#8208;LOF materials promisingly have various applications such as host&#8208;guest chemistry.







Abstract
This study employed a computational approach, particularly Density Functional Theory at B3LYP&#8722;D3/6&#8208;31+G(d) level to design two new classes of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) Lantern Organic Frameworks (LOFs) materials based on trisilasumanene and porphyrin core building units. Particularly, we detail strategies for transitioning from 1D&#8208;LOF nanowires to extended 3D structures: first by connecting planar&#8208;molecule base units of trisilasumanene or porphyrin using benzene&#8208;based linkers, and then connecting silicon anchoring atoms on the bases with other bases that are vertically stacked by sp3&#8208;hydrocarbon chains. The 3D&#8208;LOF structures are designed to have different pore sizes through the use of various bases, bridges, and linkers. Comparisons of electronic properties of these 3D structures lead to one designing rule. That is, the gap between highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the 3D materials depends only on its base and is nearly independent of the stack size or the length of the sp3&#8208;hydrocarbon bridges. Additionally, connecting base units with linkers also extends &#960;&#8208;electron conjugation system leading to a reduction in HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap. For instance, linking two trisilasumanene molecules significantly narrows HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap by 1.75&#8197;eV while stacking these bases vertically and connecting them by linear pentane&#8208;based bridges yield insignificant change to the gap.

A microwave promoted tandem reaction of free primary arylamines with diazo compounds in water for clean synthesis of 2,2&#8208;disubstituted 3&#8208;oxindoles is present. Water plays important roles in the whole cascade process: O&#8722;H insertion to diazo, air oxidation, ortho C&#8722;H functionalization, cyclization and 1,2&#8208;ester migration. In particular, water play a mediation role in the site selective ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H addition.

         <title>The Possible Aromatic Conjugation via the Different Edges of (Car)Borane Clusters: Can the Relationship Between 3D and 2D Aromatic Systems Be Reconciled?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interaction between the 2D and 3D units in the (car)borane&#8208;fused 2D ring systems was investigated computationally. Although aromatic conjugation can be excluded, other factors, such as negative hyperconjugation and ring strain, play a crucial role in the overall stability of these systems and should be taken into account during their investigation.







Abstract
The possible aromatic conjugation between 3D and 2D aromatic units is in the focus since the synthesis of benzocarborane. It has been showed that in the 3D aromatic icosahedral 1,2&#8208;dicarba&#8208;closo&#8208;dodecaborane systems fused with 2D aromatic rings a global 3D/2D aromaticity does not exist. Despite this fact during the last years several studies proposed interactions between 2D and 3D moieties. Herein, while tuning the size and the effective charge of the (car)borane systems, we demonstrate that global aromatic character can be excluded in any investigated cases, and the detectable conjugative properties can be explained the effect of the well&#8208;known negative hyperconjugation.

         <title>Pnictogen&#8208;Assisted Self&#8208;Assembly as a Means to Study Mediated Thiol/Disulfide Exchange in Supramolecular Dynamic Covalent Assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Disulfide formation and thiol&#8208;disulfide exchange are well&#8208;studied phenomena in dynamic covalent chemistry. We have shown previously that pnictogen&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly enables formation of discrete disulfide assemblies using a variety of alkyl thiols. In this report we expand the method to include aryl thiols, and we show this self&#8208;assembly method revises some prevailing wisdom on product distributions in classical disulfide formation/exchange reactions.







Abstract
Thiol&#8208;disulfide interchange has been a large field of study for both biochemists and physical organic chemists alike due to its prevalence within biological systems and fundamentally interesting dynamic nature. More recently, efforts have been made to harness the power of this reversible reaction to make self&#8208;assembling systems of macrocyclic molecules. However, less effort has focused on the fundamental work of isolating these assemblies and studying the factors that control the assembly and sorting of these emerging cyclic systems. A more complete fundamental understanding of factors controlling such self&#8208;assembly could also improve understanding of the complex systems biology of thiol exchange while also aiding in the design of dynamic thiol assembly to enable applications ranging from drug delivery and biosensing to new materials synthesis. We have shown previously that pnictogen&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly enables formation of discrete disulfide macrocycles and cages without competition from polymer formation for a wide variety of alkyl thiols. In this study, we report the expansion of pnictogen&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly methods to form disulfide bearing macrocycles from aryl thiol containing ligands, allowing access to previously unreported molecules. These studies complement classical physical organic and chemical biology studies on the rates and products of aryl thiol oxidation to disulfides, and we show that this self&#8208;assembly method revises some prevailing wisdom from these key classical studies by providing new product distributions and new isolable products in cyclic disulfide formation.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trivalent phosphorus (PIII) doped heterosumanenes (HSEs) and their phosphonium salts are synthesized. The valence states of P&#8208;dopants exert discernible effects on the molecular geometries, electronic structures, photophysical properties, and chemical reactivities of P&#8208;doped HSEs.







Abstract
Doping polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with heteroatoms enables manipulation of their electronic structures. Herein, the structures and properties of phosphorus (P) doped heterosumanenes (HSEs) are regulated by varying the valence states of P&#8208;dopant. The phosphine sulfide (PV) and chalcogens (S, Se, Te) co&#8208;doped HSEs (1&#8208;3) are reduced to trivalent phosphorus (PIII) doped analogues 4&#8211;6. Then, the PIII&#8208;dopants on 4&#8211;6 are converted to phosphonium salts (R4P+), giving 7&#8211;9. The valence states of P&#8208;dopant show great influence on molecular geometries and electronic structures. Taking P and S co&#8208;doped HSEs as example, bowl&#8208;depths increase in the order of 1 (PV)&lt;7 (R4P+)&lt;4 (PIII), and the HOMO energy levels and HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps increase to be 7&lt;1&lt;4. Consistent with the theoretical calculation, the first oxidation potentials decrease and the absorption/emission bands show blue shift from 7 to 1 to 4. The transformation of PV to PIII leads to large variations on the coordination with Ag+, owing to the alteration of coordination site from P=S to PIII. The phosphonium salts show ring&#8208;opening of phosphole rings under electrochemical reduction. It is found that chalcogen atoms play pivotal roles on coordination patterns of coordination complexes and the conversion rates of ring&#8208;opening reactions.

         <title>Conjugated Coordination Nanosheets with Molecular Rotors for Pseudocapacitors: Nanoarchitectonics and Enhanced Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three novel conjugated CNs develop by utilizing the full conjugation of the terpyridine&#8208;attached flexible tetraphenylethylene (TPE) units as the molecular rotors at the center. These nanosheets grow on bare Ni&#8208;foam through a hydrothermal route for pseudocapacitive application. Among three CNs, the high surface area with a favorable electronic configuration of RV&#8208;10&#8208;Co achieves a high specific capacity of 670.8&#8197;C/g at 1&#8197;A/g current density.







Abstract
High&#8208;level pseudocapacitive materials require incorporations of significant redox regions into conductive and penetrable skeletons to enable the creation of devices capable of delivering high power for extended periods. Coordination nanosheets (CNs) are appealing materials for their high natural electrical conductivities, huge explicit surface regions, and semi&#8208;one&#8208;layered adjusted pore clusters. Thus, rational design of ligands and topological networks with desired electronic structure is required for the advancement in this field. Herein, we report three novel conjugated CNs (RV&#8208;10&#8208;M, M=Zn, Ni, and Co), by utilizing the full conjugation of the terpyridine&#8208;attached flexible tetraphenylethylene (TPE) units as the molecular rotors at the center. We prepare binder&#8208;free transparent nanosheets supported on Ni&#8208;foam with outstanding pseudocapacitive properties via a hydrothermal route followed by facile exfoliation. Among three CNs, the high surface area of RV&#8208;10&#8208;Co facilitates fast transport of ions and electrons and could achieve a high specific capacity of 670.8&#8197;C/g (1677&#8197;F/g) at 1&#8197;A/g current density. Besides, the corresponding flexible RV&#8208;10&#8208;Co possesses a maximum energy density of 37.26&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 171&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and 70&#8201;% capacitance retention even after 1000 cycles.

         <title>Research Progress on Ni&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts for the Electrochemical Reduction of Nitrogen to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nickel&#8208;based catalysts are particularly advantageous for electrochemical ammonia synthesis due to their low cost, high efficiency, and readily available resources. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the properties and catalytic mechanisms of various nickel&#8208;based catalysts employed in nitrogen reduction reactions. Furthermore, it explores future research directions for advancing nickel&#8208;based catalyst technologies.







Abstract
The electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) to synthesize ammonia (NH3) is considered as a promising method due to its approvable advantages of zero&#8208;pollution emission, feasible reaction proceedings, good safety and easy management. The multiple efforts have been devoted to the exploration of earth&#8208;abundant&#8208;element&#8208;based nanomaterials as high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts for realizing their industrial applications. Among these, the Ni&#8208;based nanomaterials is prioritized as an attractive non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal electrocatalysts for catalyzing NRR because they are earth&#8208;abundance and exceedingly easy to synthesize as well as also delivers the potential of high electrocatalytic activity and durability. In this review, after briefly elucidating the underlying mechanisms of NRR during the electrochemical process, we systematically sum up the recent research progress in representative Ni&#8208;based electrocatalysts, including monometallic Ni&#8208;based nanomaterials, bimetallic Ni&#8208;based nanomaterials, polymetallic Ni&#8208;based nanomaterials, etc. In particular, we discuss the effects of physicochemical properties, such as phases, crystallinity, morphology, composition, defects, heteroatom doping, and strain engineering, on the comprehensive performance of the abovementioned electrocatalysts, with the aim of establishing the nanostructure&#8208;function relationships of the electrocatalysts. In addition, the promising directions of Ni&#8208;based electrocatalysts for NRR are also pointed out and highlighted. The generic approach in this review may expand the frontiers of NRR and provides the inspiration for developing high&#8208;efficiently Ni&#8208;based electrocatalysts.

         <title>Counterion Exchange Enhances the Brightness and Photostability of a Fluorous Cyanine Dye</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
While useful tools for studying perfluorocarbons, fluorous soluble fluorophores (fluorofluorophores) are often less bright and prone to rapid photobleaching in the fluorous phase. Here, we utilized a counterion modification on a fluorous pentatmethine dye (FCy5) to promote favorable cyanine character, resulting in a brighter and more photostable fluorofluorophore.







Abstract
Fluorofluorophores are a unique class of fluorophores that can be solubilized in perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and used to study biological systems. However, because of the low dielectric constant and high oxygen solubility in the fluorous phase, the brightness and photostability of the fluorofluorophores are significantly diminished. Here, we leveraged the tight ion pairing in the fluorous phase to improve the photophysical properties of a fluorous soluble pentamethine dye (FCy5) via counterion exchange. We found that larger, softer, fluorinated, aryl borate counterions promote the ideal polymethine state where charge delocalization across the polymethine chain increases the brightness (6&#8208;fold) and photostability (55&#8208;fold) of FCy5.

         <title>Platinum(II)&#8208;Salphen Complexes as DNA Binders and Photosensitisers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;activated cytotoxic agents are attractive compounds as potential anticancer drugs. A library of 21 platinum(II) complexes is presented together with a systematic study of their DNA binding affinities, photophysical and photochemical properties, cellular imaging and phototoxicity. A lead compound has been identified which is not toxic in the dark against cancer cells, but toxic at nanomolar concentrations upon irradiation.







Abstract
Current anticancer therapies suffer from issues such as off&#8208;target side effects and the emergence of drug resistance; therefore, the discovery of alternative therapeutic approaches is vital. These can include the development of drugs with different modes of action, and the exploration of new biomolecular targets. For the former, there has been increasing interest in drugs that are activated by an external stimulus (e.&#8201;g. light irradiation) to generate cytotoxic chemicals such as reactive oxygen species (ROS). For the latter, significant efforts are being directed to explore non&#8208;canonical DNA and RNA structures (e.&#8201;g. guanine&#8208;quadruplexes), as alternative biomolecular targets. Herein we report the synthesis of a library of 21 new platinum(II)&#8208;Salphen complexes (square planar platinum(II) complexes coordinated to tetradentate O,N,N,O&#8208;Schiff base ligands), and the investigation, for all complexes, of their photophysical and photochemical properties, their interactions with duplex and quadruplex DNA, and their cytotoxicity against HeLa cancer cells both in the dark and upon light irradiation. Thanks to the intrinsic phosphorescence of the platinum(II) complexes, confocal microscopy was used for six of the complexes to determine their cellular permeability and localisation in two cancer cell lines (HeLa and U2OS). Altogether, these studies have allowed us to identify two lead platinum(II) complexes with high guanine&#8208;quadruplex DNA affinity and selectivity, good cell permeability and nuclear localisation, and high cytotoxicity against HeLa cancer cells upon irradiation with no detected cytotoxicity in the dark.

For the former, there has been increasing interest in drugs that are activated by an external stimulus (e.&#8201;g. light irradiation) to generate cytotoxic chemicals such as reactive oxygen species (ROS). For the latter, significant efforts are being directed to explore non-canonical DNA and RNA structures (e.&#8201;g. guanine-quadruplexes), as alternative biomolecular targets. Herein we report the synthesis of a library of 21 new platinum(II)-Salphen complexes (square planar platinum(II) complexes coordinated to tetradentate O,N,N,O-Schiff base ligands), and the investigation, for all complexes, of their photophysical and photochemical properties, their interactions with duplex and quadruplex DNA, and their cytotoxicity against HeLa cancer cells both in the dark and upon light irradiation. Thanks to the intrinsic phosphorescence of the platinum(II) complexes, confocal microscopy was used for six of the complexes to determine their cellular permeability and localisation in two cancer cell lines (HeLa and U2OS). Altogether, these studies have allowed us to identify two lead platinum(II) complexes with high guanine-quadruplex DNA affinity and selectivity, good cell permeability and nuclear localisation, and high cytotoxicity against HeLa cancer cells upon irradiation with no detected cytotoxicity in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rh(I)/Sulfoxide&#8208;Imine&#8208;Olefin Complex Catalyzed Enantioselective Allylic Alkylation of 2&#8208;Fluoromalonate: Synthesis of Chiral &#945;&#8208;Fluorolactone Bearing Vicinal Stereogenic Centers</title>

Chiral fluorolactones A novel chiral sulfoxide&#8208;imine&#8208;olefin ligand is applyed to a rhodium catalyzed allylic substitution with monofluoro building block, resulting in high regio&#8208; and enantioselective fluorine containing allylic compounds which can be transferred to chiral fluorinated &#948;&#8208;lactones bearing vicinal stereogenic centers.







Abstract
Highly enantioselective Rh&#8208;catalyzed allylic substitution of the racemic branched allylic substrates with 2&#8208;fluoromalonate was realized enabled by a novel chiral sulfoxide&#8208;imine&#8208;olefin ligand under mild reaction conditions. The utilization of CuSO4 is beneficial for improving the enantioselectivity. Notably, the chiral fluoro&#8208;containing allyl products can be employed in a selective cyclic esterification to form chiral &#945;&#8208;fluorolactone bearing vicinal stereogenic centers.

         <title>Complexes of a Frustrated Lewis Pair&#8208;Supported P(&#8722;1) Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zinc complex of a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP)&#8208;supported P(&#8722;1) ligand is presented. This Zn complex allows access to various other P(&#8722;1)&#8208;ligated species through transmetallation. Additionally, the reaction of an FLP&#8208;chelated P(+1) compound with Na[Co(CO)4] leads to an &#951;2&#8208;phosphaborene complex which is isoelectronic to &#951;2&#8208;olefin complexes.







Abstract
Several complexes of the intramolecular frustrated Lewis pair (FLP)&#8208;supported P(&#8722;1) ligand [iPr2P(C6H4)BCy2{P}]&#8722; are presented (Cy=cyclohexyl). Chief among these is the first example of a monomeric zinc bis(phosphido) complex, which was synthesized as a potential precursor for the solution&#8208;phase deposition of Zn3P2. While this goal was ultimately unsuccessful, the Zn(II) complex acts as a convenient springboard to other metal phosphide species via transmetallation: affording a tellurium bis(phosphido) complex and a formal adduct of the phosphorus subhalide PPCl2. Trapping experiments show that the PPCl2 adduct can also be prepared directly through the in&#8197;situ reduction of PCl3 in the presence of an intramolecular FLP ligand. Lastly, we report a formal &#951;2&#8208;phosphaborene complex of cobalt(&#8722;1) which is isoelectronic to olefin complexes, and explore its bonding via density functional theory (DFT) computations.

         <title>Controlled Photooxidation via Singlet Oxygen Generation by Triplet Harvesting in a Heavy Atom Free Pure Organic Dithienylethene&#8208;Naphthalene Diimide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The content demonstrated efficient control over singlet oxygen generation using a switchable photosensitizer, where the open isomeric form of compound 7 indicated &#8220;on&#8208;state&#8221; and the closed isomeric form of compound 7 effectively switch &#8220;off&#8221; the singlet oxygen generation process.







Abstract
Noninvasive control over the reversible generation of singlet oxygen (1O2) has found the enormous practical implications in the field of biomedical science. However, metal&#8208;free pure organic emitters, connected with a photoswitch, capable of generating &#8220;on&#8208;demand&#8221; 1O2 via triplet harvesting remain exceedingly rare; therefore, the utilization of these organic materials for the reversible control of singlet oxygen production remains at its infancy. Herein, an ambient triplet mediated emission in quinoline&#8208;dithienylethene (DTE)&#8208;core&#8208;substituted naphthalene diimide (cNDI) derivative is unveiled via delayed fluorescence. The quinoline&#8208;DTE&#8208;cNDI triad displayed enhanced photoswitching efficiency via double FRET mechanism. It was found to have direct utilization in controlled photosensitized organic transformations via efficient generation of singlet oxygen (yield &#934;&#916;~0.55 in DCM and 0.73 in methanol). The designed molecule exhibits a long&#8208;lived emission (&#964;&#8764;1.1&#8197;&#956;s) and very small singlet&#8208;triplet splitting (&#916;EST) of 0.13&#8197;eV empowering it to display delayed fluorescence. Comprehensive steady state and time&#8208;resolved emission spectroscopy (TRES) analyses along with DFT calculations offer detailed understandings into the excited&#8208;state manifolds of organic compound and energy transfer (ET) pathways involved in 1O2 generation.

Rational engineering of metal tips on CdSe@CdS dot&#8208;in&#8208;rods is conducted. The optimized configuration, a gold&#8208;platinum core&#8208;shell tip with a rough surface, showed a remarkable fivefold quantum efficiency enhancement, exhibiting the maximum hydrogen&#8208;evolution rates under visible and AM1.5&#8197;G irradiation. Kinetic study reveals a large extent and a longer lifetime of the charge&#8208;separated state on the tips.







Abstract
This study explores the optimal morphology of photochemical hydrogen evolution catalysts in a one&#8208;dimensional system. Systematic engineering of metal tips on precisely defined CdSe@CdS dot&#8208;in&#8208;rods is conducted to exert control over morphology, composition, and both factors. The outcome yields an optimized configuration, a Au&#8722;Pt core&#8208;shell structure with a rough Pt surface (Au@r&#8208;Pt), which exhibits a remarkable fivefold increase in quantum efficiency, reaching 86&#8201;% at 455&#8197;nm and superior hydrogen evolution rates under visible and AM1.5&#8197;G irradiation conditions with prolonged stability. Kinetic investigations using photoelectrochemical and time&#8208;resolved measurements demonstrate a greater extent and extended lifetime of the charge&#8208;separated state on the tips as well as rapid water reduction kinetics on high&#8208;energy surfaces. This approach sheds light on the critical role of cocatalysts in hybrid photocatalytic systems for achieving high performance.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Synthesis of GeTe Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aim of this work is preparation of GeTe nanoparticles by low temperature synthetic method exploiting new organometallic precursors. The GeTe nanoparticles are amorphous and characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction, transmission and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy, laser ablation time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometry, Raman scattering spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering.







Abstract
Nanoparticles can offer an alternative approach to fabricate phase&#8208;change materials. The chemical synthesis of GeTe nanoparticles using organometallic precursors exploits high&#8208;boiling solvents and relatively high temperatures (close or even above crystallization temperatures), as reported in the available literature. The aim of this work is the preparation of GeTe nanoparticles by a low&#8208;temperature synthetic method exploiting new organometallic precursors and common organic solvents. Indeed, different preparation methods and characterization of GeTe nanoparticles is discussed. The characterization of the prepared nanomaterial was performed on the basis of X&#8208;ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy, laser ablation time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometry, Raman scattering spectroscopy, and dynamic light scattering. The results show that the low&#8208;temperature synthetic route leads to amorphous GeTe nanoparticles. Exploited organometallic precursor is stabilised by neutral ligand which can be isolated after the reaction and repeatedly used for further reactions. Furthermore, GeTe nanoparticle size can be tuned by the conditions of the synthesis.

&lt;p&gt;Nanoparticles can offer an alternative approach to fabricate phase-change materials. The chemical synthesis of GeTe nanoparticles using organometallic precursors exploits high-boiling solvents and relatively high temperatures (close or even above crystallization temperatures), as reported in the available literature. The aim of this work is the preparation of GeTe nanoparticles by a low-temperature synthetic method exploiting new organometallic precursors and common organic solvents. Indeed, different preparation methods and characterization of GeTe nanoparticles is discussed. The characterization of the prepared nanomaterial was performed on the basis of X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, laser ablation time-of-flight mass spectrometry, Raman scattering spectroscopy, and dynamic light scattering. The results show that the low-temperature synthetic route leads to amorphous GeTe nanoparticles. Exploited organometallic precursor is stabilised by neutral ligand which can be isolated after the reaction and repeatedly used for further reactions.

         <title>Total Synthesis and Structural Reassignment of the Antitubercular Natural Product Evybactin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The escalating threat posed by antibiotic resistance is a global concern and underscores the need for new antibiotics. In this context, the recent discovery of evybactin, a nonribosomal depsipeptide antibiotic that selectively and potently inhibits the growth of M. tuberculosis, is particularly noteworthy. Here, we present the first total synthesis of this natural product, along with a revision of its assigned structure. Our studies revealed a disparity between the structure originally proposed for evybactin and its actual configuration. Specifically, the 3&#8208;methylhistidine residue present in the evybactin core macrocycle was found to be of the d&#8208;configuration rather than the previously assigned l&#8208;His(Me). Having addressed this, we further optimized our solid&#8208;phase synthetic route to provide access to evybactin on a multi&#8208;hundred&#8208;milligram scale. Access to such quantities will allow for more comprehensive studies with this promising antibiotic.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Regulation of a Multi&#8208;Component Co2P2O7&#8208;MoN/NC Electrocatalyst for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Realizing efficient and durable non&#8208;precious metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) still remains a great challenge. Here, a multi&#8208;component composite of Co2P2O7&#8208;MoN/NC containing pyrophosphate, nitride, and nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon is successfully prepared via a facile two&#8208;step synthesis method. Combining the structural regulation between the active metal&#8208; and non&#8208;metal&#8208;based species, Co2P2O7&#8208;MoN/NC demonstrates superior activity and durability for OER, requiring an overpotential of 278 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2, a Tafel slope of 83.3 mV dec&#8722;1, and long&#8208;term stability over 100 h in an alkaline solution. Post&#8208;characterizations reveal that synergistic effect among stable Co2P2O7, partially dissolved MoN, N&#8208;doped carbon, and new&#8208;formed CoOOH nanosheets enable structural reconstruction, fast charge transfer, and formation of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates, promoting the OER performance significantly. This work provides a promising pathway to tune multi&#8208;components to fabricate efficient transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts in energy conversion applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Higly Luminescent Aceno[6]helicenones by Intramolecular Radical Cyclization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Helicenes and helicenoid structures are promising candidates for future applications exploiting circularly polarized light. Ideal candidates should possess near&#8208;quantitative photoluminescence quantum yield, high a luminescence dissymmetry factor and an adjustable HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap. However, carbo[n]helicenes are poorly luminescent compounds and they absorb light mainly in the ultraviolet region. Here we show that the incorporation of a carbonyl group into helical scaffold significantly improves the fluorescence quantum yield and shifts the absorption to visible region. Although the carbonyl group is commonly considered as detrimental to efficient emission, fluorescence quantum yields up to &#934; = 0.43 were recorded. A straightforward synthetic approach to a highly luminescent tetraceno[6]helicenone and an aza analogue has been developed. The key step is a radical cyclization which is achieving dehydrative &#960;&#8208;extension. The aza&#8208;analogue was incorporated as an emitter in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) and showed good performance.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reliable radical precursors are crucial for photocatalytic processes. In particular, heteroatom&#8208;stabilized radicals have attracted considerable research interest in photocatalysis. Among them, &#945;&#8208;amino radicals have received the most attention, while the research on &#945;&#8208;hydroxy radicals is much less developed. Herein, we present O&#8208;PMP &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxylic acids as novel precursors for the formation of oxygen&#8208;stabilized radicals. These radicals have been successfully used as building blocks in Pd&#8208;catalyzed allylation reactions, Ni&#8208;catalyzed arylation and alkenylation reactions, and Giese reactions.

         <title>Comparison of Different Organometallics Towards Electrophilic Aromatic 211At&#8208;Astatinations of Highly Reactive Tetrazines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organometallics can be used as precursors for electrophilic 211At&#8208;statinations. In this report, we compared the potential of aryl trimethylsilanes, &#8208;germanes, or &#8211;stannanes to be used as precursors to 211At&#8208;label highly reactive tetrazines. Tetrazines can be used for pretargeted radioligand therapies or be applied as synthons to radiolabel rapidly and orthogonally a broad set of precursors such as peptides, mAbs or nanomedicines. All precursors could successfully be synthesized and radiolabeled. The reactivity of organogermanium reagents ranged between those of respective organotin and organosilicon precursors. Moreover, organogermanium reagents proved promising for accessing more complex and polar tetrazine scaffolds. In contrast to organotin derivatives, the use of protecting groups could be avoided for organogermanium and &#8208;silicon precursors. The developed 211At&#8208;labeled tetrazines could be labeled in radiochemical conversions of 60&#8208;90%. Organogermanium and &#8208;silicon precursors were clearly advantaged as additional deprotection steps could avoided. Reported labeling procedures allow astatinations of highly reactive tetrazines to be used for pretargeted approaches or to applied as highly reactive synthons to label the next&#8208;generation of 211At&#8208;labeled radiopharmaceuticals.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactivity of Polynuclear Niobium Oxynitride Cluster Anions Nb4N5&#8211;xOx&#8722; (x = 0&#8211;5) toward N2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The activation of N&#8322; under mild conditions remains a significant challenge in chemistry. Understanding how the composition of ligands modulates the reactivity of metal centers is pivotal for the rational design of efficient catalysts for nitrogen fixation. Herein, the reactions between polynuclear niobium oxynitride anions Nb4N5&#8208;xOx&#8722; (x = 0&#8211;5) and N2 were investigated by employing mass spectrometry, photoelectron imaging spectroscopy, and theoretical calculations. The rate constants of Nb4N5&#8208;xOx&#8722;/N2 gradually decrease for x = 0 to x = 4, and then increase again for x = 5. The sharp increase of the rate constants of Nb4O5&#8722;/N2 corresponds to a decrease in the electron detachment energy of the Nb4O5&#8722; cluster in the photoelectron spectroscopic experiment. Theoretical calculations suggest that the low&#8208;coordinated Nb&#8208;Nb site in Nb4N5&#8208;xOx&#8722; (x = 0&#8211;5) behaves as the active center to bind N2 in the side&#8208;on/end&#8208;on manner. Mechanistic analysis reveals that raising the O/N ratio leads to higher electron densities on the active Nb&#8208;Nb center and decreased positive charge on the metal atoms, which hinders the approach of N2 to the clusters. This finding discloses fundamental insights into the impact of N/O ratios in fine&#8208;tuning the reactivity of metal centers towards N2 adsorption in related catalytic processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Spin Crossover and Its Application in Organometallic Catalysis: Concepts and Recent Progress</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spin crossover is one of the most important properties of open&#8208;shell metal complexes. In organometallic catalytic reactions, catalysts can alter reaction kinetics by spin crossover, i.e., accelerating or hindering the reaction progression, as well as altering reaction pathways, modulating the reaction selectivity or promoting new reactions. This personal account outlines the introduction and development of important concepts such as &#8220;two&#8208;state reactivity&#8221; involving spin crossover, and proposes a new concept, "spin&#8208;responsive catalysis" to summarize the catalytic processes in which spin effects are present. Finally, the electronic mechanism of spin crossover accelerating the reaction and the role of spin crossover in changing the reaction path and regulating the reaction selectivity are introduced by taking two recent typical iron&#8208;catalyzed reactions recently reported by our group as examples.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells with Efficient Charge Mobility and Separation Capabilities Studied by DFT</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The properties of the active layer materials play a decisive role in determining the power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells (OSCs). Chlorophyll and its derivatives are abundant and environmentally friendly functional organic molecular materials. Using density functional theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT), we have calculated the absorption spectra and their excited state properties based on optimized ground state structures. It was found that bacteriochlorin exhibits superior structural properties, a smaller energy gap and hole reorganization energy, redshifted absorption spectra, and higher hole mobility compared to the donor D18. This suggests that bacteriochlorin exhibits superior donor properties. Comparative studies between o&#8208;AT&#8208;2Cl and m&#8208;AT&#8208;2Cl showed that o&#8208;AT&#8208;2Cl had superior acceptor properties, implying that differences in substitution positions can influence the physicochemical properties of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs). Subsequently, six bulk heterojunctions (BHJs) were constructed by combining three donors with nonfused ring electron acceptors, o&#8208;AT&#8208;2Cl and m&#8208;AT&#8208;2Cl. The bacteriochlorin&#8208;based BHJs performed well among them, with BChl3/o&#8208;AT&#8208;2Cl and BChl4/o&#8208;AT&#8208;2Cl having the largest interfacial charge separation rate. The results suggested that BHJs composed of bacteriochlorin and NFAs can improve OSCs' photovoltaic performance, providing a feasible scheme for designing efficient OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Photooxidation of Toluene Derivatives under HAT and ROS Synergy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The valorization of toluene offers a dual solution by addressing its environmental impact while also facilitating the synthesis of a diverse array of valuable fine chemicals and pharmaceutical intermediates, thus ensuring both ecological sustainability and economic viability. We report herein a synergistic approach that harmonizes hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process with the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under mild condition and low catalyst loading, which enables the efficient synthesis of a broad spectrum of esteemed benzoic acid derivatives and aryl ketones through the photocatalytic oxidation of toluene derivatives.

         <title>Triscyanocorrole, the Newest and Most Intriguing Member of the C1&#8208;Substituted Corrole Family</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Considering the potential advantages of minimally sized corroles for diverse applications, this study reports a facile access to cyano&#8208;substituted derivatives via a rare CF3/CN conversion. Investigation of the fully characterized gallium, phosphorus, and cobalt complexes discloses multiple effects of the meso&#8208;nitrile groups attached to the macrocycle. This corrole appears to be the most electron poor derivative which comes into play in the redox potentials of the corresponding complexes. Compared to its precursor, both the absorption and emission are strongly red shifted and the fluorescence lifetime and quantum yield are much larger. The coordination chemistry is affected as well, by virtue of axial ligands being perpendicular rather than parallel relative to each other.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Ultrafast Excitation Energy Transfer in Tetraarylpyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole&#8208;BODIPY Dyads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have synthesized two dyads (dyad 1 and 2) comprising of tetraarylpyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole (TAPP) and BODIPY. In dyad 1, two BODIPYs are directly connected with TAPP moiety whereas in dyad 2, BODIPYs are connected through phenylethynyl linkers. TAPP is a blue energy donor which is easy to synthesize and functionalize as compared to other well&#8208;known blue energy donors like pyrene, perylene etc. This is the first report of using TAPP as an energy donor in BODIPY based dyad molecules. Complete quenching of TAPP fluorescence in the dyads suggests fast energy transfer from TAPP to BODIPY unit (ETE ~ 99.9%). Ultrafast fluorescence and transient absorption spectroscopic studies of dyad 1 showed TAPP to BODIPY energy transfer in 125 fs (kET = 8.0 x 1012 s&#8208;1) which is one of the fastest energy transfer events in BODIPY based dyad reported so far. Whereas, in dyad 2, energy transfer is almost four times slower (480 fs, kET = 2.1 x 1012 s&#8208;1). These results were rationalized by theoretical F&#246;rster formulations. This study shows that suitably matched optical properties of TAPP and BODIPY dyes along with their easy syntheses will be the key to develop highly efficient energy transfer systems in future for multiple applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterogenization of Palladium Trimer and Nanoparticles through Polymerization Boosted Catalytic Efficiencies in Recyclable Coupling and Reduction Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of heterogeneous palladium catalysts has shown continuous vitality in the field of catalysis and materials. In this work, we report one concise free radical&#160;polymerization approach to accomplish the aromatic palladium trimer functionalized polymers PSSy&#8208;[Pd3]+&#160;(2) and its&#160;derived palladium nanoparticles (3). Full characterizations&#160;could confirm&#160;the successful combination of cationic [Pd3]+&#160;or nanoparticles with poly(p&#8208;sulfonated styrene) skeleton. Compared to their monomeric tri&#8208;palladium precursor (1) and common&#160;Pd(dba)2, Pd(PPh3)4, Pd(OAc)2, heterogeneous PSSy&#8208;[Pd3]+&#160;(2) shows&#160;much superior catalytic activities (0.15 mol%, TOF = 1333.3&#160;h&#8208;1) in the SMCC reaction. The identically ligated PdNPs (3)&#160;are formed in&#8208;suit&#160;in the presence of NaBH4&#160;and&#160;accomplish quantitative reduction of&#160;4&#8208;nitrophenol in just 320&#160;s&#160;(0.50 mol%, TOF = 2250 h&#8208;1).&#160;Moreover, these heterogeneous catalysts are&#160;reused for 5&#8208;6&#160;times without significant loss of catalytic activity. Their superior catalytic ability is&#160;probably attributed to the synergistic effect of polymer entanglement and the tri&#8208;palladium fragment.&#160;This work enlightens&#160;that the immobilization of palladium&#160;clusters&#160;or nanoparticles by polymerization could offer multiple advantages in stability, efficiency&#160;and recyclability&#160;for&#160;their involved&#160;catalyses and show far&#8208;reaching future implications.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemistry with Plane&#8208;Polarized Light: Controlling Selectivity of a Photochemical Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over the past 50 years, a principal approach to controlling conventional photochemical reactions has relied on imposing geometric constraints on reactant or transition state via conducting photochemistry in the organized or constraining media. Herein, we describe a fundamentally different approach to affect the course of photochemical reactions (photochemical rearrangements) by utilizing spatially selective excitation of specific electronic transitions with plane&#8208;polarized light in the reactant molecules uniformly aligned in the nematic liquid crystal phase. In particular, we focused on the Type B enone rearrangement of 4,4&#8208;diarylcyclohexenones &#8208;&#160;one of the most common photochemical rearrangements. We demonstrated that the aryl migratory aptitude in this reaction was attenuated in response to changing an angle between the polarization plane of the incident light and the alignment direction of nematic liquid crystal, with the enhanced aryl migration achieved when the polarization plane coincided with the transition dipole moment leading to the excited state responsible for this migration. The spatially&#8208;selective initial excitation therefore was overruling the electronic factors responsible for the relative ratio of the two alternative photoproducts. The experimental findings were further supported by the results of a computational study. This work showcases a new fundamental paradigm in controlling photochemical reactivity and selectivity of photoreactions.</dc:description>

         <title>&#173;&#173;Steric Activation in the Nazarov Cyclization of Fully Substituted Divinyl Ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fully substituted divinyl ketones (fsDVKs) have long been regarded as resistant to Nazarov cyclization (NC) unless they contain strategically positioned electronically&#8208;activating substituents. Here, however, we show that fsDVKs bearing only electronically neutral alkyl or aryl groups actually undergo facile NC due to steric&#8208;crowding in the pentadienyl cation intermediate, which raises its energy and reduces the barrier height to cyclization. Strongly ionizing and suitably bulky acid moieties further increase the energy of this intermediate cation, favoring cyclization. These features enable NCs of fsDVKs to be employed in the ready construction of multiple contiguous all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters under mild conditions, in the absence&#160; of electronically activating groups.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with kagom&#233; lattice are attractive for their unique physical and chemical properties, but little attention has been paid to their catalytic properties. Herein, we report a 2D MOF based on a phosphonato&#8208;amino&#8208;carboxylate ligand (NaHL), i.e., [Na0.33Co(L)(CH3OH)2](NO3)0.33 (2), which exhibits an unconventional kagom&#233; lattice. The formation of this kagom&#233; lattice is caused by the selective recognition of the NO3&#8208; anion by the phenolato group of L2&#8208; as evidenced by theoretical calculations. Compound 2 can be utilized for the &#945;&#8208;methoxymethylation and aminomethylation of aromatic ketones using methanol as a C1 source. Interestingly, compound 2 can be exfoliated in&#8208;situ into nanosheets with one&#8208;layer thickness under catalytic reaction conditions, which improves the catalytic efficiency. Based on the results of experiments and theoretical calculations, we proposed possible pathways for the catalytic reaction.</dc:description>

Based on the results of experiments and theoretical calculations, we proposed possible pathways for the catalytic reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoinduced Self&#8208;assembly: An Alternative Strategy for the Construction of Coordination Oligomers and Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembled oligonuclear and polynuclear complexes have numerous functionalities and potential applications. Generally, such compounds have been constructed by thermal substitution reactions with bridging ligands. Herein, we report bottom&#8208;up and photochemical construction of functional coordination oligomers and polymers by photosubstitution&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly. The photosubstitution reactions of a ruthenium precursor complex with bridging ligands having pyrazole moieties afford mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, and pentanuclear ruthenium complexes, Ru1&#8211;Ru5, which have one&#8208;dimensional architectures. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding between each bridging ligand is a key to construct the molecular nanowires. All the complexes have been isolated and thoroughly characterized. The photochemically synthesized ruthenium complexes act as synthons for longer metal&#8208;complex&#8208;based nanowires with a length of the order of tens&#8208;of nanometers. The multinuclear complexes are generated by photoinduced self&#8208;assembly in the presence of a base, and they undergo photoinduced disassembly in the presence of acid.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phenols play a crucial role as core structural motifs in natural products and also serve as fundamental building blocks in synthetic chemistry. Apart from the known protocols for the conversion of aryl precursors to phenols (i.e., decarboxylative oxygenation), we report here the efficient synthesis of phenols from the stable and readily available benzylic carboxylic acids under mild reaction conditions. The photocatalytic conversion of carboxylic acids to peroxides is a crucial step in this strategy, allowing the subsequent C&#8208;O bond formation via Hock rearrangement.</dc:description>

         <title>Anisotropic porosity and interface synergy enhanced gas permselectivity in heterolayer metal&#8208;organic framework membrane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pursuit of sustainable, carbon&#8208;free separation technology hinges on the efficient separation of gas mixtures with high separation factors and flow rates, i.e. high permselectivity. However, achieving this objective is arduous due to the meticulous engineering at the angstrom scale and intricate chemical manipulation required to design the pores within membranes. To address this challenge, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for an anisotropic porous membrane has been devised. Employing a meticulous step&#8208;by&#8208;step methodology, two distinct porous metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are integrated to form a monolithic anisotropic membrane. By harnessing pore anisotropy (3.4 to 6 &#197;) aligned with the gas permeation direction and a unique interface characterized by cross&#8208;linked pores derived from the two distinct MOFs, this membrane transcends the performance limitations inherent in the individual MOF membranes (~45% enhanced selectivity). This approach not only sheds light on the heterolayer membrane design strategy but also elucidates the intricate CO2/N2 permselectivity relationship inherent in the interface structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Endogenous Cu(II) Labeling for Distance Measurements on Proteins by EPR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In&#8208;cell measurements of the relationship between structure and dynamics to protein function is at the forefront of biophysics. Recently, developments in EPR methodology have demonstrated the sensitivity and power of this method to measure structural constraints in&#8208;cell. However, the need to spin label proteins ex&#8208;situ or use noncanonical amino acids to achieve endogenous labeling remains a bottleneck. In this work we expand the methodology to endogenously spin label proteins with Cu(II) spin labels and describe how to assess in&#8208;cell spin labeling. We quantify the amount of Cu(II)&#8208;NTA in cells, assess spin labeling, and account for orientational effects during distance measurements. We compare the efficacy of using heat&#8208;shock and hypotonic swelling to deliver spin label, showing that hypotonic swelling is a facile and reproducible method to efficiently deliver Cu(II)&#8208;NTA into E. coli. Notably, over six repeats we accomplish a bulk average of 57 &#956;M spin labeled sites, surpassing existing endogenous labeling methods. The results of this work open the door for endogenous spin labeling that is easily accessible to the broader biophysical community.</dc:description>

         <title>Model catalytic studies on the thermal dehydrogenation of the benzaldehyde/cyclohexylmethanol LOHC system on Pt(111)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We investigated the dehydrogenation reaction and the thermal robustness of the liquid organic hydrogen carrier (LOHC) couple benzaldehyde/cyclohexylmethanol on a Pt(111) model catalyst in situ in synchrotron radiation photoelectron spectroscopy&#8208; and complementary temperature&#8208;programmed desorption experiments. The system stores hydrogen in a cyclohexyl group and a primary alcohol functionality and achieves an attractive hydrogen storage capacity of 7.0 mass%. We observed a stepwise dehydrogenation mechanism, characterized by a low temperature dehydrogenation of the alcohol group at 235 K. However, stability limitations challenge the system&#8217;s applicability as reversible hydrogen storage solution, as the resultant aldehyde was found to decompose during the dehydrogenation of its cyclohexyl group (between 250 and 350 K). A comparison of cyclohexylmethanol with the structurally related secondary alcohol (1&#8208;cyclo&#173;hexylethanol; 6.3 mass% hydrogen) revealed a parallel stepwise dehydrogenation pattern for both compounds, but a technically relevant superior thermal robustness of the latter. This demonstrates the influence of the alcohol group&#8217;s substitution degree on the dehydrogenation characteristics of alcohol&#8208;functionalized LOHC compounds. Density functional theory calculations are in good agreement with the experimentally observed stability trend.</dc:description>

         <title>Formulation and Release of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients using a Supramolecular Self&#8208;healing Two&#8208;component Gel</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A two&#8208;component low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelator (LMWG) formed from a modified amino acid and an aldehyde was formulated with active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). Basic APIs (propranolol, atropine) can be mixed with the LMWG prior to gel assembly while acidic APIs (naproxen, rosuvastatin) inhibit assembly by disrupting the LMWG imine bond and were loaded by diffusion after gel assembly. For diffusion&#8208;loaded gels, the API in the liquid&#8208;like phase was rapidly released, with the remainder, interacting with gel fibres, retained in the gel. Rosuvastatin release was particularly low with STD NMR indicating interactions between the aromatic ring and the self&#8208;assembled gel network. Propranolol also interacted with the gel via its aromatic unit, and its release led to gel erosion. Using agarose as a polymer gelator additive reinforced the gel, restricting erosion. In contrast, atropine was readily released over a period of hours &#8211; it is primarily in the liquid&#8208;like phase with STD NMR indicating no interactions with the gel network. The atropine&#8208;loaded gel retained its thixotropic properties. Overall, APIs must be carefully chosen to optimise formulation/release. Of the APIs investigated, atropine has most potential for further development. Atropine has applications in treating myopia, and our results suggest potential ophthalmic applications of supramolecular gels.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We present an improved and convenient synthesis of [2.2]paracyclophane&#8208;imidazoline N,O&#8208;ligands with central and planar chirality in seven steps starting from [2.2]paracyclophane. The utility of these ligands in organozinc additions to aldehydes is described. The asymmetric ethylation of aldehydes proceeded with enantioselectivities of up to 97% ee, while the asymmetric arylation of aldehydes gave up to 95% ee (R) and 82% ee (S) using (S,S,SP)&#8208;UCD&#8208;Imphanol and (S,S,RP)&#8208;UCD&#8208;Imphanol, respectively.</dc:description>
