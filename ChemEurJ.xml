         <title>Enhancing Auxiliary&#8208;mediated Native Chemical Ligation at Challenging Junctions with Pyridine Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To expand the scope of native chemical ligation (NCL) beyond reactions at cysteine, ligation auxiliaries are appended to the peptide N&#8208;terminus. We introduced the first pyridine&#8208;containing auxiliary which provided access to challenging junctions (proline or &#946;&#8208;branched amino acids). Probing the role of the pyridine ring nitrogen, we observed side reactions leading to preliminary auxiliary loss. Herein, we introduce a new, easy to attach &#946;&#8208;mercapto&#8208;&#946;&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxy&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinyl)&#8208;ethyl (MMPyE) auxiliary, which 1) has increased stability, 2) enables NCL at sterically encumbered junctions (e.g. Leu&#8208;Val) and 3) allows removal under mildly basic (pH 8.5) conditions. The synthesis of a 120 aa long peptide containing eight MUC5AC tandem repeats via ligation of two 60mers demonstrates the usefulness. Making use of hitherto unexplored NCL to tyrosine, the MMPyE auxiliary provided access to a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail&#8208;cyclized 21&#8208;mer peptide and a His  6  &#8208;tagged hexaphosphorylated peptide comprising 6 heptapeptide repeats of the RNA polymerase II C&#8208;terminal domain.</dc:description>

         <title>General Design Strategy of Anti&#8208;aromatic Porphyrinoids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 51, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We summarized six strategies to construct a high anti&#8208;aromatic porphyrinoid: 1)&#8197;Constructing a (4n) &#960;&#8208;electron anti&#8208;aromatic system; 2)&#8197;Increasing the number of pyrrole/thiophene/furan units on the &#960;&#8208;electron current ring flowing pipe; 3)&#8197;The heteroatom selecting order is &#8722;O&#8722; (optimal choice), &#8722;NH&#8722; (second choice), and &#8722;S&#8722; (last choice); 4)&#8197;The C&#8722;C=C&#8722;C unit is not beneficial for the anti&#8208;aromatic properties; 5)&#8197;Avoiding the crowded groups in the core space of an anti&#8208;aromatic macrocycle; 6)&#8197;The &#8220;circular&#8221; macrocycle is the best skeleton.







Abstract
A systematic investigation to arrange the typical anti&#8208;aromatic porphyrinoids in sequence was performed. Based on density functional theory calculations, six rules are summarized to obtain the high&#8208;performance anti&#8208;aromatic porphyrinoids: (1)&#8197;when two atoms are deleted/added on the 18&#960; electron current ring flowing pipe, we will immediately obtain a 16&#960;/20&#960; electron anti&#8208;aromatic system; (2)&#8197;it is a good idea to increase the number of pyrrole/thiophen/furan units on the &#960;&#8208;electron current ring flowing pipe; (3)&#8197;the heteroatom selecting order is &#8722;O&#8722; (optimal choice), &#8722;NH&#8722; (second choice), and &#8722;S&#8722; (last choice); (4)&#8197;it is worth noting that the C&#8722;C=C&#8722;C unit is not beneficial for the anti&#8208;aromatic properties; (5)&#8197;it is very significant to avoid the crowded environment in the core space of an anti&#8208;aromatic molecule. In this view, &#8722;O&#8722; is much better than &#8722;S&#8722; and &#8722;NH&#8722;; (6)&#8197;the &#8220;circular&#8221; skeleton is much better than an &#8220;ellipse&#8208;like&#8221;, &#8220;rectangular&#8221;, or &#8220;parallelogram&#8208;like&#8221; one.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Based Materials as Lithium Hosts for Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 51, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Owing to their low costs, high specific surface areas, high electrical conductivities, and wide electrochemical stabilities, carbon&#8208;based materials are prime candidates for use as Li hosts. This concept article describes a series of structurally&#8208;unique carbon&#8208;based materials that have been used in Li storage applications and includes an examination of the underlying mechanisms of Li dendrite growth and suppression as well as an outlook for the field.







Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal has attracted significant attention in areas that range from basic research to various commercial applications due to its high theoretical specific capacity (3860&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1) and low electrochemical potential (&#8722;3.04 vs. standard hydrogen electrode). However, dendrites often form on the surfaces of Li metal anodes during cycling and thus lead to battery failure and, in some cases, raise safety concerns. To overcome this problem, a variety of approaches that vary the electrolyte, membrane, and/or anode have been proposed. Among these efforts, the use of three&#8208;dimensional frameworks as Li hosts, which can homogenize and minimize the current density at the anode surface, is an effective approach to suppress the formation of Li dendrites. Herein, we describe the development of using carbon&#8208;based materials as Li hosts. While these materials can be fabricated into a variety of porous structures, they have a number of intrinsic advantages including low costs, high specific surface areas, high electrical conductivities, and wide electrochemical stabilities. After briefly summarizing the formation mechanisms of Li dendrites, various methods for controlling structural and surface chemistry will be described for different types of carbon&#8208;based materials from the viewpoint of improving their performance as Li hosts. Finally, we provide perspective on the future development of Li host materials needed to meet the requirements for their use in flexible and wearable devices and other contemporary energy storage techniques.

         <title>Cephem&#8208;Pyrazinoic Acid Conjugates: Circumventing Resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 51, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cephem&#8208;pyrazinoic acid (POA) conjugates were synthesized as novel agents for drug&#8208;resistant Tuberculosis (TB). Our strategy circumvents pncA&#8208;linked resistance mutations, which threaten continued use of the first&#8208;line antitubercular pyrazinamide (PZA), and also demonstrates promising activity against other resistant strains and models, achieving a codrug affect through combined action of the dual therapeutic modalities.







Abstract
Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading source of infectious disease mortality globally. Antibiotic&#8208;resistant strains comprise an estimated 10&#8201;% of new TB cases and present an urgent need for novel therapeutics. &#946;&#8208;lactam antibiotics have traditionally been ineffective against M. tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of TB, due to the organism's inherent expression of &#946;&#8208;lactamases that destroy the electrophilic &#946;&#8208;lactam warhead. We have developed novel &#946;&#8208;lactam conjugates, which exploit this inherent &#946;&#8208;lactamase activity to achieve selective release of pyrazinoic acid (POA), the active form of a first&#8208;line TB drug. These conjugates are selectively active against M. tuberculosis and related mycobacteria, and activity is retained or even potentiated in multiple resistant strains and models. Preliminary mechanistic investigations suggest that both the POA &#8220;warhead&#8221; as well as the &#946;&#8208;lactam &#8220;promoiety&#8221; contribute to the observed activity, demonstrating a codrug strategy with important implications for future TB therapy.

         <title>Calibrating Catalytic DNA Nanostructures for Site&#8208;Selective Protein Modification
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 51, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three protein&#8208;DNA conjugates were designed to calibrate the protein modification abilities of catalyst&#8208;functionalized DNA. For two catalysts, a clear correlation between distance and efficiency was found and both linker between DNA and protein as well as position and type of catalyst influenced the site of modification. Computational simulations were used to corroborate the findings.







Abstract
Many biomedical fields rely on proteins that are selectively modified. These can be attached using reactive or catalytic moieties, but the position where these moieties are attached is often poorly controlled. We assessed how catalyst position affects the efficiency and selectivity of protein modification. For this, we anchored a template DNA strand to three different proteins, which were subsequently hybridized to DNA strands that contained catalysts at different positions. We found a strong correlation between the catalyst&#8208;to&#8208;protein distance and the efficiency of protein modification for acyl transfer catalysts, which operate via a covalently bound reactant intermediate. Additionally, we found that the catalyst's distance and orientation with respect to the protein surface, also influences its site&#8208;selectivity. A catalyst operating with unbound reactant intermediates showed only enhanced efficiency. Our results are rationalized using computational simulations, showing that one&#8208;point anchoring of the DNA construct leads to notable differences in the site of modification.

         <title>Mechanistic and Kinetic Investigations of ON/OFF (Photo)Switchable Binding of Carbon Monoxide by Chromium(0), Molybdenum(0) and Tungsten(0) Carbonyl Complexes with a Pyridyl&#8208;Mesoionic Carbene Ligand</title>

Shining light on group 6&#8201;photochemistry: The reversible (photo)chemistry of chromium(0), molybdenum(0) and tungsten(0) carbonyl complexes containing a mesoionic carbene ligand has been investigated. Kinetic and mechanistic studies were performed by using (temperature&#8208;dependent) FTIR and UV/VIS spectroscopy, in combination with density functional theory calculations.







Abstract
This work tackles the photochemistry of a series of mononuclear Cr0, Mo0 and W0 carbonyl complexes containing a bidentate mesoionic carbene ligand of the 1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;5&#8208;ylidene type. FTIR spectroscopy, combined with density functional theory calculations, revealed a clean photo&#8208;induced reaction in organic solvents (acetonitrile, pyridine, valeronitrile) to give mainly one photoproduct with monosubstitution of a carbonyl ligand for a solvent molecule. The highest photodissociation quantum yields were reached for the Cr0 complex under UV irradiation (266&#8197;nm). Based on previous investigations, the kinetics of the dark reverse reactions have now been determined, with reaction times of up to several hours in pyridine. Photochemical studies in the solid state (KBr matrix, frozen solution) also showed light&#8208;induced reactivity with stabilization of the metastable intermediate with a free coordination site at very low temperature. The identified reactive species emphasizes a mechanism without ligand&#8211;sphere reorganization.

         <title>Pyrimidoquinazolinophenanthroline Opens Next Chapter in Design of Bridging Ligands for Artificial Photosynthesis
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 51, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new bridging ligand, namely pyrimidoquinazolinophenanthroline pqp, was successfully synthesized by a chemistry on the complex method using cross coupling and dehydrogenation reactions. The twisted geometry of pqp bridges the gap of already existing bridging ligands. Its photophysics can be significantly influenced by the introduction of a second metal center. Furthermore, light&#8208;induced redox catalysis was explored with a pqp&#8208;based dyad.







Abstract
The synthesis and detailed characterization of a new Ru polypyridine complex containing a heteroditopic bridging ligand with previously unexplored metal&#8208;metal distances is presented. Due to the twisted geometry of the novel ligand, the resultant division of the ligand in two distinct subunits leads to steady state as well as excited state properties of the corresponding mononuclear Ru(II) polypyridine complex resembling those of prototype [Ru(bpy)3]2+ (bpy=2,2'&#8208;bipyridine). The localization of the initially optically excited and the nature of the long&#8208;lived excited states on the Ru&#8208;facing ligand spheres is evaluated by resonance Raman and fs&#8208;TA spectroscopy, respectively, and supported by DFT and TDDFT calculations. Coordination of a second metal (Zn or Rh) to the available bis&#8208;pyrimidyl&#8208;like coordination sphere strongly influences the frontier orbitals, apparent by, for example, luminescence quenching. Thus, the new bridging ligand motif offers electronic properties, which can be adjusted by the nature of the second metal center. Using the heterodinuclear Ru&#8722;Rh complex, visible light&#8208;driven reduction of NAD+ to NADH was achieved, highlighting the potential of this system for photocatalytic applications.

Selective for selenate: An enzyme&#8208;based selenate reductase sensor has been developed for the detection of selenate. Under optimum conditions, the calibration curve was linear up to 3900.0&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 with a detection limit of 4.97&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;L&#8722;1. The recovery of selenate in real water samples was analyzed and the sensor's reliability was confirmed. None of SO42&#8722;, NO3&#8722;, NO2&#8722;, PO43&#8722; or AsO43&#8722; interfaces with selenate quantification.







Abstract
An enzymatic biosensor has been developed for the determination of selenate (SeO42&#8722;), in which selenate reductase (SeR) is chemically attached to a gold disk electrode by lipoic acid N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide ester as linker, allowing the catalytic reduction of the SeO42&#8722; to SeO32&#8722;. Modification of the gold electrode was characterized by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF&#8208;SIMS), and electrochemistry. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) measurements were performed in different buffers for selenate determination. Under optimum conditions, the calibration curve was linear over the range 7.0&#8211;3900.0&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 with limits of detection and quantification of 4.97 and 15.56&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;L&#8722;1, respectively. The possible interference of the relevant oxyanions SO42&#8722;, NO3&#8722;, NO2&#8722;, PO43&#8722; and AsO43&#8722; in the determination of SeO42&#8722; was studied. Finally, the proposed biosensor was used to determine SeO42&#8722; with recovery between 95.2 and 102.4&#8201;% in different real water samples.

         <title>Atmospheric&#8208;Temperature Chain Reaction towards Ultrathin Non&#8208;Crystal&#8208;Phase Construction for Highly Efficient Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 51, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multistep chain reaction at atmospheric temperature restructures the surface of high&#8208;crystallinity cobalt carbonate hydroxides (CCHs). An ultrathin (&#8764;5&#8197;nm) lattice&#8208;disorder layer of Fe(OH)3 on the CCH appeared to form CCH&#8722;FeOH hetero&#8208;interfaces, which are of great benefit for nano&#8208;interface exposure. The microscopic surface morphology of the material (CCH&#8722;FeOH&#8208;Dx) can be controlled by adjusting the degree of chain reaction. The as&#8208;obtained CCH&#8722;FeOH with an ultrathin shell structure is conducive to mass transfer and ion migration, giving excellent HER/OER performance.







Abstract
Combining the self&#8208;sacrifice of a highly crystalline substance to design a multistep chain reaction towards ultrathin active&#8208;layer construction for high&#8208;performance water splitting with atmospheric&#8208;temperature conditions and an environmentally benign aqueous environment is extremely intriguing and full of challenges. Here, taking cobalt carbonate hydroxides (CCHs) as the initial crystalline material, we choose the Lewis acid metal salt of Fe(NO3)3 to induce an aqueous&#8208;phase chain reaction generating free CO32&#8722; ions with subsequent instant FeCO3 hydrolysis. The resultant ultrathin (&#8764;5&#8197;nm) amorphous Fe&#8208;based hydroxide layer on CCH results in considerable activity in catalyzing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), yielding 10/50&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at overpotentials of 230/266.5&#8197;mV for OER and 72.5/197.5&#8197;mV for HER. The catalysts can operate constantly in 1.0&#8197;M KOH over 48 and 45&#8197;h for the OER and HER, respectively. For bifunctional catalysis for alkaline electrolyzer assembly, a cell voltage as low as 1.53&#8197;V was necessary to yield 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (1.7&#8197;V at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). This work rationally builds high&#8208;efficiency electrochemical bifunctional water&#8208;splitting catalysts and offers a trial in establishing a controllable nanolevel ultrathin lattice disorder layer through an atmospheric&#8208;temperature chemical route.

         <title>Aggregation Modes of Chiral Diketopyrrolo[3,4&#8208;c]pyrrole Dyes in Solution and Thin Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 51, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aggregation modes of four new chiral diketopyrrolo[3,4&#8208;c]pyrrole (DPP) dyes, functionalized with enantiopure alkyl groups from natural sources, were deeply investigated in condition of solution aggregation and thin films by electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectroscopy. ECD revealed superior capability, compared to absorbance spectroscopy, to provide information on the aggregation modes and to detect the possible co&#8208;existence of multiple aggregation pathways.







Abstract
The chiroptical features of chiral diketopyrrolo[3,4&#8208;c]pyrrole (DPP) derivatives have been only marginally investigated to date. In this regard, we have synthesized ad hoc four chiral DPP dyes, functionalized with enantiopure alkyl groups from natural sources either on the lactam moieties or on the terminal positions of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone, to promote an efficient self&#8208;assembly into chiral supramolecular structures. For each of them, the aggregation modes has been investigated by absorbance and ECD spectroscopies in conditions of solution aggregation and on thin films, considering the effects of deposition technique (drop casting vs. spin coating) and post&#8208;deposition operations (solvent and thermal annealing). The effect of the structure of lateral &#960;&#8208;conjugated units attached to the central DPP scaffold, as well as that of the position of the alkyl chiral group, has been assessed. ECD revealed superior capability, compared to absorbance spectroscopy, to provide information on the aggregation modes and to detect the possible co&#8208;existence of multiple aggregation pathways.

         <title>Facet Engineering on WO3 Mono&#8208;Particle&#8208;Layer Electrode for Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 51, September 12, 2022. </description>

Facet&#8208;aligned WO3 photoelectrodes: An electrode with planar configuration of massively assembled WO3 plates exposes (002) facets to the electrolyte so that bulk hole diffusion and interfacial charge transfer are facilitated. Photo&#8208;deposited Au at electron enriched {110} edges is positioned at the bottom to further improve charge collection to the substrate.







Abstract
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance of WO3 photoanodes for water splitting is heavily influenced by the orientation of crystal facets. In this work, mono&#8208;particle&#8208;layer electrodes, assembled by particulate WO3 square plates with highly uniform alignment along the (002) facet, improved PEC water oxidation kinetics and stability. Photo&#8208;deposition of Au along the cracks formed on the surface of the plates, which are the edges of {110} facets, was found to further enhance electron collection efficiency. Combination of these two strategies allowed the facet&#8208;engineered WO3 electrode to produce significantly higher efficiencies in charge separation and transfer than the electrode prepared without facet orientation. This work has provided a facile route for fabricating a structurally designed WO3 photoelectrode, which is also applicable to other regularly shaped semiconductor photocatalysts with anisotropic charge migration.

         <title>Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification of a Porous Hydrocarbon Cage to Give a Discrete Co24 Organometallic Complex
</title>

A robust porous cage was synthesized using irreversible alkyne coupling reactions. Reaction with dicobalt octacarbonyl gave exhaustive metalation of the 12 alkyne units to give the Co24(CO)72 adduct of the cage in a single pot.







Abstract
A new alkyne&#8208;based hydrocarbon cage was synthesized in high overall yield using alkyne&#8208;alkyne coupling in the cage forming step. The cage is porous and displays a moderately high BET surface area (546&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1). The cage loses crystallinity on activation and thus is porous in its amorphous form, while very similar cages have been either non&#8208;porous, or retained crystallinity on activation. Reaction of the cage with Co2(CO)8 results in exhaustive metalation of its 12 alkyne groups to give the Co24(CO)72 adduct of the cage in good yield.

         <title>[2+3] Amide Cages by Oxidation of [2+3] Imine Cages &#8211; Revisiting Molecular Hosts for Highly Efficient Nitrate Binding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 51, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of second generation amide cages were synthesized in high yields by converting imine cages by Pinnick oxidation reactions. By NMR titration experiments, one amide cage was identified having superior selectivities of nitrate vs. chloride (S=705) or hydrogensulfate (S &gt;13400) in combination with high association constants for nitrate.







Abstract
The pollution of groundwater with nitrate is a serious issue because nitrate can cause several diseases such as methemoglobinemia or cancer.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A series of second generation&lt;/b&gt; amide cages were synthesized in high yields by converting imine cages by Pinnick oxidation reactions. By NMR titration experiments, one amide cage was identified having superior selectivities of nitrate vs. chloride (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;=705) or hydrogensulfate (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt;13400) in combination with high association constants for nitrate.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pollution of groundwater with nitrate is a serious issue because nitrate can cause several diseases such as methemoglobinemia or cancer. Therefore, selective removal of nitrate by efficient binding to supramolecular hosts is highly desired. Here we describe how to make [2+3] amide cages in very high to quantitative yields by applying an optimized Pinnick oxidation protocol for the conversion of corresponding imine cages. By NMR titration experiments of the eight different [2+3] amide cages with nitrate, chloride and hydrogen sulfate we identified one cage with an unprecedented high selectivity towards nitrate binding vs. chloride (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;=705) or hydrogensulfate (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;&amp;gt;13500) in CD&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CD&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN (1&#8201;:&#8201;3). NMR experiments as well as single-crystal structure comparison of host-guest complexes give insight into structure-property-relationships.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8211;ligand Lability and Ligand Mobility Enables Framework Transformation via Ligand Release in a Family of Crystalline 2D Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 51, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional coordination polymers exhibit ligand extrusion into the vapour phase on heating to undergo an extensive structural reorganisation involving bond breaking and formation, ligand migration and reorientation. The reactions occur with retention of crystallinity and have been followed in&#8197;situ by PXRD.







Abstract
A family of seven silver(I)&#8208;perfluorocarboxylate&#8208;quinoxaline coordination polymers, [Ag4(O2CRF)4(quin)4] 1&#8211;5 (RF=(CF2)n&#8208;1CF3)4, n=1 to 5); [Ag4(O2C(CF2)2CO2)2(quin)4] 6; [Ag4(O2CC6F5)4(quin)4] 7 (quin=quinoxaline), denoted by composition as 4&#8201;:&#8201;4&#8201;:&#8201;4 phases, was synthesised from reaction of the corresponding silver(I) perfluorocarboxylate with excess quinoxaline. Compounds 1&#8211;7 adopt a common 2D layered structure in which 1D silver&#8208;perfluorcarboxylate chains are crosslinked by ditopic quinoxaline ligands. Solid&#8208;state reaction upon heating, involving loss of one equivalent of quinoxaline, yielding new crystalline 4&#8201;:&#8201;4&#8201;:&#8201;3 phases [Ag4(O2C(CF2)n&#8208;1CF3)4(quin)3]n (8&#8211;10, n=1 to 3), was followed in&#8197;situ by PXRD and TGA studies. Crystal structures were confirmed by direct syntheses and structure determination. The solid&#8208;state reaction converting 4&#8201;:&#8201;4&#8201;:&#8201;4 to 4&#8201;:&#8201;4&#8201;:&#8201;3 phase materials involves cleavage and formation of Ag&#8722;N and Ag&#8722;O bonds to enable the structural rearrangement. One of the 4&#8201;:&#8201;4&#8201;:&#8201;3 phase coordination polymers (10) shows the remarkably high dielectric constant in the low electric field frequency range.

         <title>Prussian Blue Type Cocatalysts for Enhancing the Photocatalytic Water Oxidation Performance of BiVO4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 51, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Six MII&#8208;CoIII Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) (M=Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn) cocatalysts are synthesized and deposited on the surface of BiVO4 for boosting the surface catalytic efficiency and enhancing photogenerated carries separation efficiency of BiVO4.







Abstract
The efficiency of photocatalytic overall water splitting reactions is usually limited by the high energy barrier and complex multiple electron&#8208;transfer processes of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Although bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) as the photocatalyst has been developed for enhancing the kinetics of the water oxidation reaction, it still suffers from challenges of fast recombination of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs and poor photocatalytic activity. Herein, six MII&#8208;CoIII Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) (M=Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn) cocatalysts are synthesized and deposited on the surface of BiVO4 for boosting the surface catalytic efficiency and enhancing photogenerated carries separation efficiency of BiVO4. Six MII&#8208;CoIII PBAs@BiVO4 photocatalysts all demonstrate increased photocatalytic water oxidation performance compared to that of BiVO4 alone. Among them, the Co&#8722;Co PBA@BiVO4 photocatalyst is employed as a representative research object and is thoroughly characterized by electrochemistry, electronic microscope as well as multiple spectroscopic analyses. Notably, BiVO4 coupling with Co&#8722;Co PBA cocatalyst could capture more photons than that of pure BiVO4, facilitating the transfer of photogenerated charge carriers between BiVO4 and Co&#8722;Co PBA as well as the surface catalytic efficiency of BiVO4. Overall, this work would promote the synthesis strategy development for exploring new types of composite photocatalysts for water oxidation.

         <title>Adamantyl Side Chains as Anti&#8208;Aggregating Moieties in Dyes for Dye&#8208;Sensitized Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 51, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel triarylamine dyes are reported, that are decorated with ethyladamantyl side chains on the &#960;&#8208;spacer (BSH&#8208;2), and on the donor (BSH&#8208;3). The ethyladamantyl modified dyes display higher photovoltages than the non&#8208;modified reference dye (JK&#8208;305). DSSC devices prepared with the adamantyl decorated donor dye (BSH&#8208;3) and the anti&#8208;aggregation additive CDCA display the best PCE of the series, at 6.1&#8201;%.







Abstract
Designing and evaluating novel dye concepts is crucial for the development of the field of dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). In our recent report, the novel concept of tethering the anti&#8208;aggregation additive chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) to dyes for DSSC was introduced. Based on the performance improvements seen for this modification, the aim of this study is to see if a simplified anti&#8208;aggregation unit could achieve similar results. The following study reports the synthesis and photovoltaic characterization of two novel dyes decorated with the steric ethyladamantyl moiety on the &#960;&#8208;spacer, and on the triarylamine donor. This modification is demonstrated to be successful in increasing the photovoltages in devices employing copper&#8208;based electrolytes compared to the non&#8208;modified reference dye. The best photovoltaic performance is achieved by a device prepared with the adamantyl decorated donor dye and CDCA, this device achieves a power conversion efficiency of 6.1&#8201;% (Short&#8208;circuit current=8.3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, Open&#8208;circuit voltage=1054&#8197;mV, Fill factor=0.69). The improved photovoltaic performance seen for the adamantyl decorated donor demonstrate the potential of ethyladamantyl side chains as a tool to ensure surface protection of TiO2.

         <title>Phosphorescence Induction by Host&#8208;Guest Complexation with Cyclodextrins &#8211; The Role of Regioisomerism and Affinity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 51, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8208;soluble aromatic thioethers reveal orange phosphorescence emission upon the formation of 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 inclusion complexes with &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin, which was proven by state of the art photophysical characterisations as well as ITC&#8208;, NMR&#8208; and fluorescence titration&#8208;measurements supported by molecular dynamics simulations. It was found that not only the binding affinity but also the orientation of the guest in and around the cavity is crucial to restrict motion able to induce the emission.







Abstract
We present an in&#8208;depth investigation of cyclodextrin complexes with guest compounds featuring complexation&#8208;induced room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in aqueous solution. Very interestingly, only the complexed regioisomers bearing lateral substituents on meta&#8208;position show RTP, whereas the stronger host&#8208;guest systems with para&#8208;substituted dyes show no RTP features. The reported systems were investigated regarding their complexation behavior in water using isothermal titration calorimetry and mass spectrometry. In the case of &#947;&#8208;CD very strong 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 inclusion complexes (Ka up to 5.13&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1) were unexpectedly observed. It was found that not only a strong binding to the cyclodextrin cavity is needed to restrict motion, inducing the emission, but also the conformation inside the cavity plays a pivotal role &#8211; as supported by an extensive NMR study and MD simulations.

         <title>Sterically Controlled Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization of Bulky Phosphines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 51, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to the high affinity of phosphines for transition metals, C&#8722;H functionalization of aryl phosphines is dominated by phosphorus&#8208;directed reactions. Here, we pair a sterically controlled borylation reaction of unprotected phosphines with phosphine self&#8208;assisted Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura reactions to grant ready access to libraries of functionalized phosphines with a positional selectivity that complements existing methods.







Abstract
The fine&#8208;tuning of metal&#8208;phosphine&#8208;catalyzed reactions relies largely on accessing ever more precisely tuned phosphine ligands by de&#8208;novo synthesis. Late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization and diversification of commercial phosphines offers rapid access to entire libraries of derivatives based on privileged scaffolds. But existing routes, relying on phosphorus&#8208;directed transformations, only yield functionalization of C
&#8722;H bonds in a specific position relative to phosphorus. In contrast to phosphorus&#8208;directed strategies, herein we disclose an orthogonal functionalization strategy capable of introducing a range of substituents into previously inaccessible positions on arylphosphines. The strongly coordinating phosphine group acts solely as a bystander in the sterically controlled borylation of bulky phosphines, and the resulting borylated phosphines serve as the supporting ligands for palladium during diversification through phosphine self&#8208;assisted Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reactions.

         <dc:description>
Kinetic and mechanistic investigations of the photo&#8208;induced reversible binding and release of CO to Cr0, Mo0 and W0 complexes with pyridyl&#8208;mesoionic carbene ligands ([LM(CO)4]) are reported. Irradiation of the complexes in the solid state at 10&#8197;K leads to a FTIR spectroscopically detectable intermediate [LM(CO)3] without ligand&#8211;sphere reorganization. In solution, clean conversion to a stable photoproduct [LM(CO)3Xaxial] (X=MeCN, BuCN, Py) is observed. The photodissociation quantum yield increases from W0 via Mo0 to Cr0 up to 46&#8201;%. It is remarkable that there is a fully reversible CO exchange, especially as the reverse recombination reaction with the solvated CO can take hours (Cr&#8810;Mo&lt;W); this opens a new field of highly selective (photo)switchable transition metal complexes. More information can be found in the Research Article by G. Niedner&#8208;Schatteburg, B. Sarkar, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201038).

         <title>Competing C&#8208;4&#8201;and C&#8208;5&#8208;Acyl Stabilization of Uronic Acid Glycosyl Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uronic acids have a unique reactivity in stereoselective glycosylation reactions. The competing intramolecular stabilization in uronic acid cations by the C&#8208;5 carboxylic acid or the C&#8208;4 acetyl group was studied using infrared ion spectroscopy and computational energy landscape maps. This reveals how the intrinsic interplay of the different functional groups influences the formation of the different regioisomeric products.







Abstract
Uronic acids are carbohydrates carrying a terminal carboxylic acid and have a unique reactivity in stereoselective glycosylation reactions. Herein, the competing intramolecular stabilization of uronic acid cations by the C&#8208;5 carboxylic acid or the C&#8208;4 acetyl group was studied with infrared ion spectroscopy (IRIS). IRIS reveals that a mixture of bridged ions is formed, in which the mixture is driven towards the C&#8208;1,C&#8208;5 dioxolanium ion when the C&#8208;5,C&#8208;2&#8208;relationship is cis, and towards the formation of the C&#8208;1,C&#8208;4 dioxepanium ion when this relation is trans. Isomer&#8208;population analysis and interconversion barrier computations show that the two bridged structures are not in dynamic equilibrium and that their ratio parallels the density functional theory computed stability of the structures. These studies reveal how the intrinsic interplay of the different functional groups influences the formation of the different regioisomeric products.

         <title>Reaction of Pertechnetate in Highly Alkaline Solution: Synthesis and Characterization of the Nitridotrioxotechnetate Ba[TcO3N]</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hot chemistry. The nitridotrioxotechnetate anion has been obtained by the reaction of ammonium pertechnetate under highly alkaline conditions. In addition to a single crystal structure analysis, Raman data proves the existence of Tc&#8722;O and Tc&#8722;N bonds. The oxidation state +VII has further been corroborate by XANES and EXAFS measurements.







Abstract
The preparation of novel technetium oxides, their characterization and the general investigation of technetium chemistry are of significant importance, since fundamental research has so far mainly focused on the group homologues. Whereas the structure chemistry of technetium in strongly oxidizing media is dominated by the 
 anion, our recent investigation yielded the new 
 anion. Brown single crystals of Ba[TcO3N] were obtained under hydrothermal conditions starting from Ba(OH)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;8H2O and NH4[TcO4] at 200&#8201;&#176;C. 
 crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system with the space group P21/n (a=7.2159(4)&#8197;&#197;, b=7.8536(5)&#8197;&#197;, c=7.4931(4)&#8197;&#197; and &#946;=104.279(2)&#176;). The crystal structure of 
 consists of isolated 
 tetrahedra, which are surrounded by Ba2+ cations. XANES measurements complement the oxidation state +VII for technetium and Raman spectroscopic experiments on Ba[TcO3N] single crystals exhibit characteristic Tc&#8722;O and Tc&#8722;N vibrational modes.

         <title>Elucidating the Nature of the External Acid Sites of ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolites Using NMR Probe Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure and acid properties of external sites of ZSM&#8208;5&#8201;zeolites, namely terminal SiOH groups, pore&#8208;mouth Br&#248;nsted, and tricoordinated Al&#8208;Lewis acid sites, are elucidated through the interaction of samples of distinct particle size with the NMR probe molecule trimethylphosphine oxide, assisted by computational methods.







Abstract
The identification of acid and nonacid species at the external surface of zeolites remains a major challenge, in contrast to the extensively&#8208;studied internal acid sites. Here, it is shown that the synthesis of zeolite ZSM&#8208;5 samples with distinct particle sizes, combined with solid&#8208;state NMR and computational studies of trimethylphosphine oxide (TMPO) adsorption, provides insight into the chemical species on the external surface of the zeolite crystals. 1H&#8211;31P HETCOR NMR spectra of TMPO&#8208;loaded zeolites exhibit a broad correlation peak at &#948;P &#8764;35&#8211;55&#8197;ppm and &#948;H &#8764;5&#8211;12&#8197;ppm assigned to external SiOH species. Pore&#8208;mouth Br&#248;nsted acid sites exhibit 31P and 1H NMR resonances and adsorption energies close to those reported for internal acid sites interacting with TMPO. The presence of an external tricoordinate Al&#8208;Lewis site interacting strongly with TMPO is suggested, resulting in 31P resonances that overlap with the peaks usually ascribed to the interaction of TMPO with Br&#248;nsted sites.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical coupling of amines and carboxylic acids generates a wide variety of amides and dipeptides. The operationally simple and robust process is mediated by iodide and produces triphenylphosphine oxide as a recyclable co&#8208;product. A combination of boron&#8208;doped diamond (BDD) anode and a platinum cathode ensures maximum performance. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Opatz et&#8197;al.

         <title>Photochromic Fentanyl Derivatives for Controlled &#956;&#8208;Opioid Receptor Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoresponsive fentanyl&#8208;based ligands provide the opportunity to spatially, temporally, and non&#8208;invasively regulate &#956;&#8208;opioid receptor activity by using light. The repertoire of such ligands has been expanded in this work, yielding a desirable selection that differ in photophysical properties and/or metabotropic response.







Abstract
Photoswitchable ligands as biological tools provide an opportunity to explore the kinetics and dynamics of the clinically relevant &#956;&#8208;opioid receptor. These ligands can potentially activate or deactivate the receptor when desired by using light. Spatial and temporal control of biological activity allows for application in a diverse range of biological investigations. Photoswitchable ligands have been developed in this work, modelled on the known agonist fentanyl, with the aim of expanding the current &#8220;toolbox&#8221; of fentanyl photoswitchable ligands. In doing so, ligands have been developed that change geometry (isomerize) upon exposure to light, with varying photophysical and biochemical properties. This variation in properties could be valuable in further studying the functional significance of the &#956;&#8208;opioid receptor.

         <title>Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence of a Dinuclear Platinum(II) Compound: Mechanism and Roles of an Upper Triplet State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A four&#8208;state (S0, S1, T1, and T2) model is proposed to rationalize the TADF behavior of a dinuclear Pt(II) compound and two up&#8208;conversion channels are found to contribute TADF at 300&#8197;K: the direct T1&#8594;S1 channel and the T2&#8208;mediated T1&#8594;T2&#8594;S1 one. Both channels contribute to TADF.







Abstract
A dinuclear Pt(II) compound was reported to exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF); however, the luminescence mechanism remains elusive. To reveal relevant excited&#8208;state properties and luminescence mechanism of this Pt(II) compound, both density function theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent DFT (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations were carried out in this work. In terms of the results, the S1 and T2 states show mixed intraligand charge transfer (ILCT)/metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand CT (MLCT) characters while the T1 state exhibits mixed ILCT/ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal CT (LMCT) characters. Mechanistically, a four&#8208;state (S0, S1, T1, and T2) model is proposed to rationalize the TADF behavior. The reverse intersystem crossing (rISC) process from the initial T1 to final S1 states involves two up&#8208;conversion channels (direct T1&#8594;S1 and T2&#8208;mediated T1&#8594;T2&#8594;S1 pathways) and both play crucial roles in TADF. At 300&#8197;K, these two channels are much faster than the T1 phosphorescence emission enabling TADF. However, at 80&#8197;K, these rISC rates are reduced by several orders of magnitude and become very small, which blocks the TADF emission; instead, only the phosphorescence is observed. These findings rationalize the experimental observation and could provide useful guidance to rational design of organometallic materials with superior TADF performances.

         <title>Infusion of Variable Chemical Structure to Tune Stacking among Metal&#8211;Organic Layers in 2D Nano MOFs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stacking vs thickness: Stacking between the metal&#8211;organic layers (MOLs) of MOFs determines their thickness: the higher the stacking, the higher the thickness. This thickness plays an important role in controlling the function of the material, hence, regulating the stacking in 2D nano&#8208;MOFs might be very important. We tuned the stacking by modulating the chemical structure of the organic linkers in a series of isostructural MOFs. AFM, XRPD, FESEM, etc. showed the chemical functionality of the linkers to play a pivotal role in modulating stacking efficiency. Such an approach might open a new avenue in controlling the thickness of 2D materials. More information can be found in the Research Article by B. Manna, S. Ida et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201665).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,3&#8208;Dipolar cycloadditions of azomethine ylide (three atoms highlighted in yellow) and a broad scope of alkenyl boronates (the former C=C bond is highlighted in green) provide bi&#8208; and trifunctional 3&#8208;borylated pyrrolidines with diverse substitution patterns (including fused and spirocyclic ones) valuable for synthetic and medicinal chemistry. The background photo of a beautiful steep shore was taken at the locally well&#8208;recognized Stanislav canyon in the Kherson region, Ukraine. More information can be found in the Research Article by O.&#8197;O. Grygorenko and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202117).

         <title>Vibrational Circular Dichroism Unravels Supramolecular Chirality and Hydration Polymorphism of Nucleoside Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular VCD of nucleoside crystal solvomorphs: Vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectra of guanosine microcrystals exhibit sign inversion upon reversible crystal hydration/dehydration. Such spectral changes occur due to alteration of molecular arrangement in the crystal. Supramolecular chirality of the crystals brings about two&#8208;orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude enhancement of the VCD signal, thus enabling almost instantaneous spectra measurements. This could be utilized in pharmaceutical industry, e.&#8201;g. for quality and stability control.







Abstract
Vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectroscopy has been widely used to study (bio)molecules in solution. However, its solid&#8208;state applications have been restricted due to experimental limitations and artifacts. Having overcome some of them, the first VCD study of nucleoside crystals is now presented. A two&#8208;orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude enhancement of VCD signal was observed due to high molecular order in the crystals and resulting supramolecular chirality. This allowed to obtain high&#8208;quality VCD spectra within minutes using minute amounts of samples. The VCD technique is extremely sensitive in detecting changes in a crystal order and is able to distinguish different hydration states of crystals. This elevates it to a new level, as a fast and efficient tool to study chiral crystalline samples. This study demonstrates that VCD is capable of near&#8208;instantaneous detection of hydration polymorphs and crystal degradation, which is of substantial interest in pharmaceutical industry (quality and stability control).

This study demonstrates that VCD is capable of near-instantaneous detection of hydration polymorphs and crystal degradation, which is of substantial interest in pharmaceutical industry (quality and stability control).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Charge&#8208;Transfer Transitions Govern the Reactivity and Photophysics of Vicinally Diphosphanyl&#8208;Substituted Diborapentacenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction provides facile access to the ambipolar dihydrodiborapentacene P with two vicinal Ph2P substituents. Irradiation with visible light leads to a pronounced P&#8208;to&#8208;B charge transfer, which impacts the optoelectronic properties and reactivity of P and can in turn be modulated by Ph2P oxidation or transition&#8208;metal coordination.







Abstract
2,3&#8208;Difluoro&#8208;5,14&#8208;dihydro&#8208;5,14&#8208;diborapentacene (DBP) was endowed with two vicinal Ph2P groups by an SNAr reaction at both CF sites using Ph2PSiMe3. Computations reveal the ambipolar product P to undergo P&#8208;to&#8208;B charge transfer under ambient light irradiation. Consequently, P is prone to photooxidation by air, yielding the Ph2P(O) species PO. With S8 or [Me3O][BF4], P furnishes the Ph2P(S) or Ph2P(Me)+ derivatives PS or [PMe][BF4]2. Along the series P, PO, PS, and [PMe][BF4]2, the redox potentials shift anodically from E1/2=&#8722;1.89&#8197;V to &#8722;1.02&#8197;V (CH2Cl2). Thus, derivatization of the Ph2P group allows late&#8208;stage modulation of the LUMO&#8208;energy level of the DBP. Derivatization also influences the emission properties of the compounds, as PO shows green (521&#8197;nm) and [PMe][BF4]2 red (622&#8197;nm) fluorescence in C6H6, while P and PS are dark. With CuBr and AgBr, P forms dimeric [M(&#956;&#8208;Br)]2 complexes [PCu]2 and [PAg]2, which show pronounced metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT), making P a promising ligand for photocatalysts.

         <title>Chemoselective Coupling of &#960;&#8208;Systems to Access Metallated 1,4&#8208; or 1,5&#8208;Skipped Dienes in Multicomponent Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Integrating distinct unsaturated C&#8211;C systems while simultaneously installing metallic groups has been significantly challenging to execute in a multicomponent reaction. Therefore, designing a suitable mechanistic pathway that provides the required reactivity and selectivity for target C&#8211;C bonds with metallic reagents to ensure successful coupling is the key to success. Copper&#8208;catalyzed borylallylation and silylallylation have emerged as the most efficient strategies for assembling borylated/silylated skipped (1,4 or 1,5) dienes by catalytically combining an organocopper intermediate with allyl electrophiles. However, reactions involving interelemental reagents (e.g., [Si]&#8211;[B]) to accomplish intermolecular atom&#8208;economic couplings have not been studied thoroughly. Therefore, to aid the development of new transformations in this research area, we attempted to include all precedents, including our recent studies. The present Concept article may be extremely useful for researchers working in this area as it provides a strong conceptual framework.</dc:description>

         <title>CH&#8208;&#960;&#160;Multi&#8208;Interaction&#8208;Driven Recognition and Isolation of Planar Compounds in a Spheroidal Polyaromatic Cavity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#960;&#8208;&#960; Interactions are established as a powerful supramolecular tool, whereas the usability of CH&#8208;&#960; interactions has been rather limited so far. Here we present (i) selective binding of planar polyaromatics and (ii) effective isolation of planar metal complexes by a polyaromatic capsule, utilizing multiple CH&#8208;&#960; interactions. In the spheroidal cavity, one molecule of large and medium&#8208;sized polyaromatic molecules (i.e., coronene and pyrene) is exclusively bound from mixtures bearing the same number of aromatic CH groups. Theoretical studies reveal that multiple host&#8208;guest CH&#8208;&#960; interactions (up to 32 interactions) are the predominant driving force for the observed selectivity. In addition, one molecule of planar metal complexes (i.e., porphine and bis(acetylacetonato) Cu(II) complexes) is quantitatively bound by the capsule through aromatic and aliphatic CH&#8208;&#960; multi&#8208;interactions, respectively. The ESR and theoretical studies demonstrate the isolation capability of the capsular framework and an unusual polar environment in the polyaromatic cavity.</dc:description>

         <title>A Photochemical Macrocyclization Route to Asymmetric Strained [3.2]Paracyclophanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: The intricate frameworks of paracyclophanes found in various chiral auxiliars, solar cells, high&#8208;performance plastics, pharmaceuticals, and molecular machines have become an important target for synthesis. Whereas numerous methods exist for the preparation of symmetric paracyclophanes, protocols for the efficient synthesis of strained asymmetric scaffolds are limited. Here we report a remarkable simple photochemical route to strained [3.2]paracyclophanes starting from readily available educts. By way of NMR and x&#8208;ray analyses, we discovered that UV&#8208;irradiation of an aromatic carboxylic ester tethered to a toluene moiety leads to the intramolecular formation of a new C&#8208;C bond, with loss of an alcohol. A systematic evaluation of the reaction conditions and substituents, as well as radical starter and triplet quenching experiments suggest a reaction mechanism involving an excited triplet state and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). The robust and versatile new method succeeded in the synthesis of range of cyclophanes with different substitutions, including an unusual diastereoisomer with two planar chiral centers and thus proved to be a valuable addition for the synthetic toolbox.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantiodivergent Chemoenzymatic Dynamic Kinetic Resolution: Conversion of Racemic Propargyl Alcohols into Both Enantiomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural lipases typically recognize enantiomers of alcohols based on size differences of substituents near the carbinol moiety and selectively react with (  R  )&#8208;enantiomers of secondary alcohols. Therefore, lipase&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of racemic secondary alcohols produces only (  R  )&#8208;enantiomers. We report herein a method for obtaining (  S  )&#8208;enantiomers by DKR of secondary 3&#8208;(trialkylsilyl)propargyl alcohols using a well&#8208;known (  R  )&#8208;selective  Pseudomonas fluorescens  lipase in combination with a racemization catalyst VMPS4, in which the silyl group reverses the size relationship of substituents near the carbinol moiety. Since we have already reported (  R  )&#8208;selective DKR of the corresponding propargyl alcohols without substituents on the ethynyl terminal carbon, the presence of an easily removable silyl group has enabled us to produce both enantiomers of propargyl alcohols in high chemical yields and with high enantiomeric excess. In addition, the immobilization of the lipase on Celite was found to be important for achieving the high efficiency of the DKR.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A visible&#8208;light mediated chemoselective transfer hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;aryl imino esters was demonstrated. The methodology has allowed the efficient and practical preparation of &#945;&#8208;amino acid esters. The mechanism of the reaction was probed by DFT calculations and deuteration experiments, indicated deuterium was introduced into amino acid esters efficiently (up to 99% D ratio), enabling a feasible way to obtain deuterated amino acids using D  2  O as a cheap deuterium source.</dc:description>

         <title>Observing Nearby Nuclei on Paramagnetic Trityls and MOFs via DNP and Electron Decoupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) is an NMR sensitivity enhancement technique that mediates polarization transfer from unpaired electrons to NMR&#8208;active nuclei. Despite its success in elucidating important structural information on biological and inorganic materials, the detailed polarization&#8208;transfer pathway&#8212;from the electrons to the nearby and then the bulk solvent nuclei, and finally to the molecules of interest&#8212;remains unclear. In particular, the nuclei in the paramagnetic polarizing agent play significant roles in relaying the enhanced NMR polarizations to more remote nuclei. Despite their importance, the direct NMR observation of these nuclei is challenging because of poor sensitivity. Here, we show that a combined DNP and electron decoupling approach can enable direct NMR detection of these nuclei. We achieved an ~80% improvement in NMR intensity via electron decoupling at 0.35 T and 80 K on trityl radicals. Moreover, we recorded a DNP enhancement factor of &#120576; ~ 90 and ~11% higher NMR intensity using electron decoupling on paramagnetic metal&#8208;organic framework, magnesium hexaoxytriphenylene (MgHOTP MOF).</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
&#8220;The introduction of pseudo&#8208;meta PCPs into carbon&#8208;based macrocycles allowed us to obtain four enantiopure polygon&#8208;shaped structures in high yield, displaying unprecedented large molar circular dichroism values for all&#8208;carbon macrocycles and high absorption dissymmetry factors.&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at 10.1002/chem.202201764).







Abstract
Invited for the cover of this issue is the group of Marcel Mayor at the University of Basel with co&#8208;workers Olaf Fuhr and Dieter Fenske from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. The image depicts the studied all&#8208;carbon polygon shaped macrocycles along with their intense circular dichroism spectra in the background. The bright light within the macrocycles displays its efficient conjugation. Read the full text of the article at 10.1002/chem.202201764.

         <title>Unprecedented Combination of Polyketide Natural Product Fragments Identifies the New Hedgehog Signaling Pathway Inhibitor Grismonone</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pseudo&#8208;natural products (pseudo&#8208;NPs) are de novo combinations of natural product (NP) fragments that define novel bioactive chemotypes. For their discovery, new design principles are being sought. Previously, pseudo&#8208;NPs were synthesized by the combination of fragments originating from biosynthetically unrelated NPs to guarantee structural novelty and novel bioactivity. We report the combination of fragments from biosynthetically related NP in novel arrangements to yield a novel chemotype with activity not shared by the guiding fragments. We describe the synthesis of the polyketide pseudo&#8208;NP grismonone and identify it as a structurally novel and potent inhibitor of Hedgehog signalling. The insight that the de novo combination of fragments derived from biosynthetically related NPs also may yield new biologically relevant compound classes with unexpected bioactivity may be considered a chemical extension or diversion of existing biosynthetic pathways and greatly expands the opportunities for exploration of biologically relevant chemical space by means of the pseudo&#8208;NP principle.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Strategies for Dendritic Magneto&#8208;Plasmonic Nanostructures Applied to Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical analyses in the field using surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) protocols are expected to be part of several analytical procedures applied to water quality monitoring. To date, these endeavors have been supported by developments on SERS substrate nanofabrication, instrumentation portability and the internet of things. Here, we report distinct chemical strategies for preparing magneto&#8208;plasmonic (Fe  3  O  4  :Au) colloids, which are relevant in the context of trace level detection of water contaminants due to their inherent multifunctionality. The main objective of this research is to investigate the role of poly(amidoamine) dendrimers (PAMAM) in the preparation of SERS substrates integrating both functionalities in single nanostructures. Three chemical routes have been investigated to design magneto&#8208;plasmonic nanostructures which translate into different ways for assessing SERS detection using distinct interfaces. Hence, a series of magneto&#8208;plasmonic colloids have been characterized and then assessed for their SERS activity by using a model pesticide (thiram) dissolved in aqueous samples.</dc:description>

         <title>Phomoxanthone A Targets ATP Synthase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phomoxanthone A is a naturally occurring molecule and a powerful anti&#8208;cancer agent, although its mechanism of action is unknown. To facilitate the determination of its biological target(s) we used affinity&#8208;based labelling using a phomoxanthone A probe. Labelled proteins were pulled down, subjected to chemoproteomics analysis using LC&#8208;MS/MS and ATP synthase was identified as a likely target. Mitochondrial ATP synthase was validated in cultured cells lysates and in live intact cells. Our studies show sixty percent inhibition of ATP synthase by 260&#160; m M phomoxanthone A.</dc:description>

         <title>Trianionic 1,3,2&#8208;Dioxaborine&#8208;Containing Polymethines: Bright Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Trianionic polymethines of the A&#8242;&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A&#8242; type comprising the dioxaborine rings (A) and different electron accepting end&#8208;groups (A&#8242;) were synthesized. The obtained dyes absorb and emit light in the near&#8208;infrared region with remarkably high molar attenuation coefficients (&#603;, up to 495&#8201;000 M&#8722;1cm&#8722;1  in DMF) and fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;f, up to 0.73 in DMF). Thus, the novel trianionic dyes take a stand among the brightest individual fluorophores known to date&#8212;with the magnitude of fluorescence brightness (&#603;&#8729;&#934;f) of 313&#8201;000 M&#8722;1cm&#8722;1  in DMF. The synthesized dyes demonstrate a minor negative solvatochromism and small Stokes shifts. The X&#8208;ray data reveal the nearly planar geometry of the trianionic chromophore. All the obtained compounds are stable in the solid state and in a solution, although the relative stability is much higher in polar aprotic than in protic solvents.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly active La(III)&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework as a heterogeneous Lewis acid catalyst for Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, a novel La(III)&#8208;based two&#8208;dimensional (2&#8208;D) metal&#8208;organic framework, [La  2/3  (qptca)  1/2  ] (referred to as SLX&#8208;2), from LaCl  3  and 1,1':4',1'':4'',1''':4''',1''''&#8208;quinquephenyl]&#8208;2,2'',2'''',5''&#8208;tetracarboxylic acid (H  4  qptca) was synthesized by conventional solvothermal method and thoroughly characterized using X&#8208;ray single crystal diffraction, powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, and thermogravimetric analyses. The 2&#8208;D SLX&#8208;2 features a unique lanthanum center exposed to the skeleton and then was used as an efficient Lewis acid catalyst for the Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation of indole and pyrrole with &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene along with a wide substrate scope, giving the desired products in good to high yields under the optimal reaction conditions. Furthermore, the catalyst was used for twenty cycles, with nearly no effect on its activity, and the reaction was heterogeneous in nature. Moreover, compared to the previous hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;donating MOF catalysts for such alkylation reactions, SLX&#8208;2 showed an excellent stability toward harsh acidic and basic environment, and gave comparable catalytic activities.</dc:description>

         <title>Bicomponent Cocatalyst Decoration on Flux&#8208;assisted CaTaO2N Single Crystals for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cubic&#8208;like CaTaO  2  N photocatalysts with high crystallinity and uniform particle size were successfully prepared by the flux&#8208;assisted nitridation method. The growth of CaTaO  2  N single crystals under different synthesis conditions was systematically investigated to understand the effects of the crystallinity and optical property on photocatalytic performance of CO  2  reduction. Moreover, the modification of CaTaO  2  N single crystals with core&#8208;shell Ni&#8208;Ag bicomponent cocatalyst by two&#8208;step decoration process exhibited higher rate of CO evolution than the deposition of sole Ag cocatalyst, because of the synergistic effects of bicomponent cocatalyst on the interfacial electron transfer and surface catalytic process. This study provides a valuable way to construct high&#8208;crystalline photocatalysts with effective bicomponent cocatalyst for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO  2  reduction with H  2  O.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrated reversible thermochromism, high Tc, dielectric switch and narrow band gap in one multifunctional ferroic</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic&#8208;inorganic Hybrid (OIH) materials for multifunctional switchable applications have attracted enormous attentions in recent years due to their excellent optoelectronic properties and good structural tunability. However, it still remains challenging to fabricate one simple OIH compound with multi&#8208;functionals properties, such as dielectric switching, thermochromic properties, semiconductor characteristics and ferroelasticity. Under this context, we successfully synthesized [2&#8208;(2&#8208;fluorophenyl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;amine]2SnBr6 (compound 1), which has a higher phase transition temperature of 427.7 K. Additionally, it exhibits a semiconducting property with an indirect band gap of 2.36 eV. Combining ferroelastic, narrow band gap, thermochromic, and dielectric properties, compound 1 can be considered as a rarely reported multi&#8208;functional ferroelastic material, which is expected to give inspiration for broadening the new applications in the multifunctional smart devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulation of metal carbonyl stretching frequencies in the second coordination sphere through the internal Stark effect</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Evolution of a Synthetic Strategy for Garsubellin A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Garsubellin A is a thirty&#8208;carbon meroterpenoid capable of enhancing the enzyme choline acetyltransferase whose decreased level is associated with the symptoms of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. Due to the potentially useful biological activity along with the novel molecular architecture, this plant metabolite has remained a popular synthetic target. Herein we report a full account of our synthetic investigations that have led to the enantioselective total synthesis of garsubellin A, establishing its absolute stereostructure. The protecting group&#8208;free, twelve&#8208;step synthetic route has enabled the syntheses of the natural (&#8211;)&#8208;garsubellin A and its unnatural (+)&#8208;antipode.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the Mechanistic Aspects on [3 + 2]&#160;Cycloaddition Reactions of Azides to Nitroolefins: A Computational and Kinetic Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>[3+2] cycloadditions of nitroolefins have emerged as a selective and catalyst&#8208;free alternative for the synthesis of 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles from azides. We describe mechanistic studies into the cycloaddition/rearomatization reaction sequence. DFT calculations revealed a rate&#8208;limiting cycloaddition step proceeding via an asynchronous TS with high kinetic selectivity for the 1,5&#8208;triazole. Kinetic studies reveal a second&#8208;order rate law, and  13  C kinetic isotopic effects at natural abundance were measured with a significant normal effect at the conjugated olefinic centers of 1.0158 and 1.0216 at the &#945; and &#946;&#8208;carbons of &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene. Distortion/interaction&#8208;activation strain and energy decomposition analyses revealed that the major regioisomeric pathway benefits from an earlier and less&#8208;distorted TS, while intermolecular interaction terms dominate the preference for 1,5&#8208; over 1,4&#8208;cycloadducts. In addition, the major regioisomer also has more favorable electrostatic and dispersion terms. Additionally, while static DFT calculations suggest a concerted but highly asynchronous  Ei  &#8208;type HNO  2  elimination mechanism, quasiclassical direct&#8208;dynamics calculations reveal the existence of a dynamic intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Architecture of an Amphiphilic Amino Alcohol as a Versatile Chiral Environment for Stereocontrolled Photoreaction of Various Anthracenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular architecture of an amphiphilic amino alcohol serves as unprecedentedly versatile chiral environment, which can efficiently control the stereochemistry of the self&#8208;photocyclodimerization of various anthracenes (71&#8211;98&#8201;% regio ratio, 76&#8211;86&#8201;% ee) as well as the cross&#8208;photocyclodimerization between two anthracenes (58&#8201;% chemo ratio, 83&#8201;% regio ratio, 90&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
The photocyclodimerization of 2&#8208;anthracenecarboxylic acid has been extensively studied as a model reaction of asymmetric photochemistry. So far, numerous chiral environments have been employed to control this photoreaction, while the scope of photoreactants has been limited only to 2&#8208;anthracenecarboxylic acid and its simple esters and amides. Here, we developed a systematic series of photoreactants (2&#8201;a&#8211;d) by introducing various substituents to 2&#8208;anthracenecarboxylic acid, which showed different reactivities and selectivities depending on the substituents. By using the photoreactants 2&#8201;a&#8211;d, we evaluated the performance of a chiral environment composed of an amphiphilic amino alcohol (1), where the photocyclodimerization of 2&#8201;a&#8211;d generally proceeded in excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities (71&#8211;98&#8201;% regio ratio, 76&#8211;86&#8201;% ee). Furthermore, by reacting 2&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b together in the chiral environment of 1, we succeeded in the first stereocontrolled cross&#8208;photocyclodimerization between two prochiral anthracenes (58&#8201;% chemo ratio, 83&#8201;% regio ratio, 90&#8201;% ee).

         <title>Unravelling the Role of the Pentafluoroorthotellurate Group as a Ligand in Nickel Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The homoleptic [Ni(OTeF5)4]2&#8722; anion has been selectively prepared and arises as an analogue of [NiF4]2&#8722;, but featuring the discrete tetrahedral geometry of the heavier halonickelates. This high&#8208;spin complex has enabled the investigation of the electronic properties of the [OTeF5]&#8722; group in coordination chemistry, showing that it behaves as the fluoride also in ligand&#8208;field terms.







Abstract
The pentafluoroorthotellurate group (teflate, OTeF5) is able to form species, for which only the fluoride analogues are known. Despite nickel fluorides being widely investigated, nickel teflates have remained elusive for decades. By reaction of [NiCl4]2&#8722; and neat ClOTeF5, we have synthesized the homoleptic [Ni(OTeF5)4]2&#8722; anion, which presents a distorted tetrahedral structure, unlike the polymeric [NiF4]2&#8722;. This high&#8208;spin complex has allowed the study of the electronic properties of the teflate group, which can be classified as a weak/medium&#8208;field ligand, and therefore behaves as the fluoride analogue also in ligand&#8208;field terms. The teflate ligands in [NEt4]2[Ni(OTeF5)4] are easily substituted, as shown by the formation of [Ni(NCMe)6][OTeF5]2 by dissolving it in acetonitrile. Nevertheless, careful reactions with other conventional ligands have enabled the crystallization of nickel teflate complexes with different coordination geometries, i.e. [NEt4]2[trans&#8208;Ni(OEt2)2(OTeF5)4] or [NEt4][Ni(bpyMe2)(OTeF5)3].

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Olefin Metathesis: Recent Theoretical and Experimental Advances</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron&#8208;catalyzed olefin metathesis is high on the list of existing challenges in chemistry. Iron is one of the most abundant elements in the earth&#8216;s crust, and, therefore, iron catalysts would offer highly attractive alternatives to Ru&#8208; and Mo&#8208;based catalysts. This Review summarizes the key recent theoretical and experimental advances towards the development of iron&#8208;catalyzed olefin metathesis.

The &#8220;metathesis reaction&#8221; is a straightforward and often metal&#8208;catalyzed chemical reaction that transforms two hydrocarbon molecules to two new hydrocarbons by exchange of molecular fragments. Alkane, alkene and alkyne metathesis have become an important tool in synthetic chemistry and have provided access to complex organic structures. Since the discovery of industrial olefin metathesis in the 1960s, many modifications have been reported; thus, increasing scope and improving reaction selectivity. Olefin metathesis catalysts based on high&#8208;valent group six elements or Ru(IV) have been developed and improved through ligand modifications. In addition, significant effort was invested to realize olefin metathesis with a non&#8208;toxic, bio&#8208;compatible and one of the most abundant elements in the earth&#8242;s crust; namely, iron. First evidences suggest that low&#8208;valent Fe(II) complexes are active in olefin metathesis. Although the latter has not been unambiguously established, this review summarizes the key advances in the field and aims to guide through the challenges.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Iron-catalyzed olefin metathesis&lt;/b&gt; is high on the list of existing challenges in chemistry. Iron is one of the most abundant elements in the earth&#8216;s crust, and, therefore, iron catalysts would offer highly attractive alternatives to Ru- and Mo-based catalysts. This Review summarizes the key recent theoretical and experimental advances towards the development of iron-catalyzed olefin metathesis.

         <title>Azobenzene&#8208;based Photochromic Delivery Vehicles for Ions and Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azobenzene&#8208;based supramolecular photochromic scaffold for the light&#8208;controlled binding and release of the guest molecules such as anions, cations, and neutral molecules have been demonstrated. These smart photochromic&#8208;hosts display light&#8208;induced change in molecular recognition and thus can act as the light&#8208;driven delivery vehicle for the external analytes.







Abstract
Molecular switches have been used as delivery vehicles for various molecular and ionic species. The ones that reversibly operate with light are arguably the best candidates for the purpose as they can be operated using light. The two states of these photoswitchable systems often possess remarkable differences in terms of their structural features and electronic properties. Photochromic systems with the appropriate embellishment of functionalities at suitable positions have thus been used as photoresponsive receptors. The use of light&#8208;driven alterations of the structural features has led to differential molecular recognition with these switchable host molecules. In this article, we discuss the use of such supramolecular systems as the delivery vehicles for ions and molecules that started with the pioneering work by Shinkai back in 1979. This review will explicitly cover the development from 2001 to 2022 with some past background and the future prospects of the field.

         <title>Dehydrocoupling Polymerization: Poly(silylether) Synthesis by Using an Iron &#946;&#8208;Diketiminate Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient iron catalyzed method for the formation of poly(silylether)s has been developed, where the only by&#8208;product of the reaction is hydrogen gas. Fourteen different polymers have been prepared, which show a range of different thermal properties. Insight into the reaction, which proceeds via a condensation polymerization mechanism is provided.







Abstract
We describe the iron&#8208;catalyzed polymerizations of diol and silane monomers to obtain fourteen different poly(silylether) products with number average molecular weights (Mn) up to 36.3&#8197;kDa. The polymerization reactions developed in this study are operationally simple and applicable to 1&#176; and 2&#176; silane monomer substrates and a range of benzylic and aliphatic diol substrates as well as one polyol example. The polymers were characterized by IR spectroscopy, DSC and TGA and, where solubility allowed, 1H, 13C{1H}, 29Si{1H} NMR spectroscopies, GPC and MALDI&#8208;TOF were also employed. The materials obtained displayed low Tg values (&#8722;70.6 to 19.1&#8201;&#176;C) and were stable upon heating up to T&#8211;5%,Ar 421.6&#8201;&#176;C. A trend in T&#8211;5%,Ar was observed whereby use of a 2&#176; silane leads to higher T&#8211;5%,Ar compared to those obtained using a 1&#176; silane. Reaction monitoring was undertaken by in situ gas evolution studies coupled with GPC analysis to follow the progression of chain&#8208;length growth which confirmed a condensation polymerization&#8208;type mechanism.

         <title>Hydrophilic Chitosan Derivatives: Synthesis and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nature&#8208;sourced polymer alternatives have attracted increasing attention for applications in medicine, cosmetics, agriculture, food, water purification, and more. Among those, chitosan, is the most versatile due to its full biodegradability, exceptional biocompatibility, multipurpose bioactivity, and low toxicity. Although remarkable progress has been made regarding its synthetic modifications using C3/C6 secondary/primary hydroxyl (&#8208;OH) and the C2 amino (&#8208;NH2) active sites, its solubility under physiological conditions remained limited and hampered larger&#8208;scale adoption. This minireview summarizes different synthetic methods that increase chitosan's hydrophilicity and water solubility using covalent modifications, namely, amino acid addition, quaternary ammonium formation, phosphorylation, and carboxymethylation. We also reviewed several applications for each type of substitution in fields such as cosmetics, medicine, agriculture, water purification etc., and provided an outlook and perspective for future modifications and implementations.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Various base&#8208;stabilized silyliumylidene ions with different ligands were synthesized. Their behaviour appeared strongly dependent on the type of ligand. Indeed, in contrast to the poorly reactive silyliumylidenes stabilized by strongly donating ligands (DMAP, NHC), the sulfide&#8208;supported one (SMe  2  ) exhibits higher reactivity toward various small molecules. Furthermore, their capability to successively activate multiple small molecules was clearly demonstrated by processes involving successive reactions with silane / formamide, CO  2  and H  2  . Of particular interest, the silyliumylidene&#8208;silylene complex is one of the very rare species able to activate two H  2  molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Capturing a Pentacyclic Fragment&#8208;Based Library Derived from Perophoramidine: Their Design, Synthesis and Evaluation as Anticancer Compounds by DNA Double&#8208;Strand Breaks (DSB) and PARP&#8208;1 Inhibition</title>

A Pentacyclic fragment inspired from Perophoramidine. Natural product inspired PARP inhibitor.







Abstract
Herein we have reported the discovery of a pentacyclic building block comprised of fused indole&#8208;quinoline and piperidinone from the natural product perophoramidine as a formidable anticancer agent. The compounds were synthesized in six steps where the key steps involved a blue LED mediated intramolecular cyclopropanation of the indole intermediates and concomitant reduction of the associated aryl nitro moiety to nitroso in the molecule. Cytotoxicity screening of the compounds against an array of cancer cells that is, MCF7, HCT116 and A549 demonstrated 0.6 to 9&#8197;&#956;M IC50s by few of the compounds. &#947;H2AX immunofluorescence assay of the two most potent molecules from the phenotypic screening with anti&#8208;&#947;&#8208;H2AX Alexa Fluor 488 antibody revealed extensive DNA damage of the A549 cells which indicated probable PARP inhibition (similar to Perophoramidine). Through molecular docking and molecular dynamic (MD) simulation studies the binding efficiency of our compounds with poly(ADP&#8208;ribose)polymerase 1 (PARP 1) enzyme was determined. Chemiluminescent PARP Assay with Histone&#8208;coated strips indicated that the most active compounds from the phenotypic screening induced PARP&#8208;1 inhibition with IC50s of 1.3&#8594;1.5&#8197;&#956;M.

Cytotoxicity screening of the compounds against an array of cancer cells that is, MCF7, HCT116 and A549 demonstrated 0.6 to 9&#8197;&#956;M IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;s by few of the compounds. &#947;H2AX immunofluorescence assay of the two most potent molecules from the phenotypic screening with anti-&#947;-H2AX Alexa Fluor 488 antibody revealed extensive DNA damage of the A549 cells which indicated probable PARP inhibition (similar to Perophoramidine). Through molecular docking and molecular dynamic (MD) simulation studies the binding efficiency of our compounds with poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase 1 (PARP 1) enzyme was determined. Chemiluminescent PARP Assay with Histone-coated strips indicated that the most active compounds from the phenotypic screening induced PARP-1 inhibition with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;s of 1.3&#8594;1.5&#8197;&#956;M.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Arylfluorination of Alkenes: A Powerful New Approach to Organofluorine Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multitasking: One of the newly developed methods for accessing organofluorine compounds is Pd&#8208;catalyzed arylfluorination, which simultaneously introduces an aryl group and a fluorine atom into an olefin framework. This review provides a concise overview of this powerful and versatile method.







Abstract
Fluorine incorporation into organic molecules is often beneficial to their absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties or bioactivity. As a consequence, organofluorine compounds have become quite common amongst drugs and agrochemicals, and their preparation is a highly important topic in both synthetic organic chemistry and pharmaceutical chemistry. One of the newly developed methods for accessing organofluorine compounds is Pd&#8208;catalyzed arylfluorination of alkenes. It is an olefin difunctionalization process that simultaneously introduces an aryl group and a fluorine atom into an alkene framework. This review provides a concise overview of this powerful and versatile method.

         <title>Free Aluminylenes: An Emerging Class of Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbene analogues: Free aluminylenes and mono&#8208;base&#8208;stabilized aluminylenes are extremely reactive species. The ambiphilicity of these species allows facile activation of inert chemical bonds as well as coordination to transition metals in diverse modes. Free aluminylenes are potent synthons for unusual aluminium species.







Abstract
Aluminylenes (R&#8722;Al) are aluminium analogs of carbenes. In contrast to isolable carbenes, aluminylenes are extremely rare species. In the past years, pioneered by Schn&#246;ckel, Roesky and Power, a few free aluminylenes and their complexes have been reported. Such compounds have the aluminium atom in the oxidation state +I, which contrasts with classical organoaluminium derivatives that contain the element in the +III oxidation state. Aluminylenes, either in their free state or in the coordination sphere of a Lewis base, are capable of coordinating to transition metals and activating inert chemical bonds. Free aluminylenes are emerging as potent synthetic platforms for unusual aluminium species.

         <title>Dioxygen Activation by Redox&#8208;Active Bis(aldimine) Ligand Bridged Diruthenium Complex Possessing Singlet Ground State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligand&#8208;centered dioxygen activation and oxygenation of bis(aldimine) core have been highlighted on a dinuclear Ru platform utilizing the concept of spin isomerism at the redox&#8208;active metal&#8208;ligand interface. Authentication of the complexes along with the redox non&#8208;innocence behavior of their bridge have been validated through structure, spectroelectrochemistry, and DFT calculations.







Abstract
The unexplored &#8216;actor&#8217; behavior of redox&#8208;active bis(aldimine) congener, p&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bis(picoline)aldimine (L1), towards dioxygen activation and subsequent functionalization of its backbone was demonstrated on coordination with {Ru(acac)2} (acac= acetylacetonate). Reaction under aerobic condition led to the one&#8208;pot generation of dinuclear complexes with unperturbed L1, imino&#8208;carboxamido (L2&#8722;), and bis(carboxamido) (L32&#8722;)&#8208;bridged isovalent {RuII(&#956;&#8208;L1)RuII}, 1/ {RuIII(&#956;&#8208;L32&#8722;)RuIII}, 3 and mixed&#8208;valent {RuII(&#956;&#8208;L2&#8722;)RuIII}, 2. Authentication of the complexes along with the redox non&#8208;innocence behavior of their bridge have been validated through structure, spectroelectrochemistry and DFT calculations. Kinetic and isotope labelling experiments together with DFT analyzed transition states justified the consideration of redox shuttling at metal/L1 interface for 3O2 activation despite of the closed shell configuration of 1 (S=0) to give carboxamido derived 2/3.

         <title>Bismuth gadolinium oxychloride with a remarkable visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive O2 evolution activity promoted by iodine doping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive bismuth&#8208;based oxyhalide has recently attracted extensive attention, however, the promotion of its charge separation is still challenging. Herein, we introduce iodine into Bi2GdO4Cl to synthetize I&#8208;doped Bi2GdO4Cl (denoted as yI&#8208;Bi2GdO4Cl, 0&#8804;y&#8804;2).   The incorporation of I&#8208;  ions is found to enhance light absorption and to accelerate charge separation by combining various characterizations such as density functional theory calculation, photoelectrochemical test, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectrum, and open&#8208;circuit voltage decay.  The O2&#8208;evolving performances of 1I&#8208;Bi2GdO4Cl with optimized dopant concentration of I&#8208;  ion and the IrO2  loaded 1I&#8208;Bi2GdO4Cl are tremendously promoted by  ca.  4 and 45 times compared with pristine Bi2GdO4Cl. Notably, The O2  evolution rate reaches as high as 154.8 &#956;mol&#183;h&#8208;1  with an apparent quantum efficiency of ~1.1% at 420 nm.  The synthetic iodine&#8208;doped photocatalyst remains stability after long&#8208;term photoreaction, demonstrating its potential  in the field of photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Two Tags in One Probe: Combining Fluorescence&#8208; and Biotin&#8208;based Detection of the Trypanosomal Cysteine Protease Rhodesain</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly potent, bimodal activity&#8208;based probe for the therapeutically relevant cysteine protease rhodesain was developed. We utilized two different access points at the coumarin fluorophore for incorporation of the rhodesain inhibitor part and the biotin affinity label. The two reporter tags were employed for on&#8208;blot chemiluminescence detection and affinity purification as well as post&#8208;labeling quantification of the target protein by size exclusion chromatography with fluorescence detection.







Abstract
Rhodesain is the major cysteine protease of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei and a therapeutic target for sleeping sickness, a fatal neglected tropical disease. We designed, synthesized and characterized a bimodal activity&#8208;based probe that binds to and inactivates rhodesain. This probe exhibited an irreversible mode of action and extraordinary potency for the target protease with a kinac/Ki value of 37,000&#8197;M&#8722;1s&#8722;1. Two reporter tags, a fluorescent coumarin moiety and a biotin affinity label, were incorporated into the probe and enabled highly sensitive detection of rhodesain in a complex proteome by in&#8208;gel fluorescence and on&#8208;blot chemiluminescence. Furthermore, the probe was employed for microseparation and quantification of rhodesain and for inhibitor screening using a competition assay. The developed bimodal rhodesain probe represents a new proteomic tool for studying Trypanosoma pathobiochemistry and antitrypanosomal drug discovery.

We designed, synthesized and characterized a bimodal activity-based probe that binds to and inactivates rhodesain. This probe exhibited an irreversible mode of action and extraordinary potency for the target protease with a &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;inac&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; value of 37,000&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Two reporter tags, a fluorescent coumarin moiety and a biotin affinity label, were incorporated into the probe and enabled highly sensitive detection of rhodesain in a complex proteome by in-gel fluorescence and on-blot chemiluminescence. Furthermore, the probe was employed for microseparation and quantification of rhodesain and for inhibitor screening using a competition assay. The developed bimodal rhodesain probe represents a new proteomic tool for studying &lt;i&gt;Trypanosoma&lt;/i&gt; pathobiochemistry and antitrypanosomal drug discovery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Non&#8208;covalent integration of a [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase mimic to multiwalled carbon nanotubes for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface integration of molecular catalysts inspired from the active sites of hydrogenase enzymes represents a promising route towards developing noble metal&#8208;free and sustainable technologies for H  2  production. Efficient and stable catalyst anchoring is a key aspect to enable this approach. Here, we report the preparation and electrochemical characterization of an original diironhexacarbonyl&#160;complex including two pyrene groups per catalytic unit in order to allow for its smooth integration, through  pi&#8208;pi&#160;  interactions, onto MWNT based electrodes. In this configuration, the grafted catalyst could reach turnover numbers for H  2  production (TON  H2  ) of up to 3.5 &#177; 1.6 x 10  3  within 20 hours of bulk electrolysis, operating at neutral pH.  Post operando  analysis of catalyst func&#173;tionalized electrodes revealed the degradation of the catalytic unit occurred  via  loss of the Fe  2  (CO)  6  units, while the anchoring groups and most part of the ligand remained attached onto MWNT.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkyne Activation in the Diversity Oriented Synthesis of sp2&#8208;Rich Scaffolds: A Biased Library Approach for Targeting Polynucleotides (DNA/RNA)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polynucleotides, DNA and RNA (mRNA and non&#8208;coding RNAs), are critically involved in molecular pathways. Small molecule binding interactions with polynucleotides can modify functional polynucleotide topologies and/or their interactions with proteins. Current approaches to library design (lead&#8208;like or fragment&#8208;like libraries) are based on protein&#8208;ligand interactions and often include careful consideration of the 3&#8208;dimensional orientation of binding motifs and exclude &#960;&#8208;rich compounds (polyfused aromatics) to avoid off&#8208;target R/DNA interactions. In contrast to proteins, where &#960;,&#960;&#8208;interactions are weak, polynucleotides can form strong &#960;,&#960;&#8208;interactions with suitable &#960;&#8208;rich ligands. To assist in designing a polynucleotide&#8208;biased library, a scaffold&#8208;divergent synthesis approach to polyfused aromatic scaffolds has been undertaken. Initial screening hits that form moderately stable polynucleotide&#8208;ligand&#8208;protein ternary complexes can be further optimised through judicious incorporation of substituents (R&#8208;groups) to increase protein&#8208;ligand interactions. An example of this approach is given for topoisomerase&#8208;1 (TOP1), generating a novel TOP1 inhibitory chemotype.</dc:description>

         <title>Discriminating Chiral Supramolecular Motions by Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular motions from the molecular level to the macroscopic scale were discriminated by circularly polarized luminescence, which was associated with the stage of assembly and the geometry of the hierarchically organized particles.







Abstract
Molecular motions are closely associated with the behaviors and properties of organic materials. However, monitoring molecular motions is challenging. Herein, a chiral supramolecular system consisting of L&#8208;/D&#8208;phenylalanine (LPF/DPF) as a chiral inducer and an achiral tetraphenylethene derivative (TPEF) as a molecular rotor has been proposed and explored for real&#8208;time discriminating the supramolecular motions by the visualization of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) signal variations. Derived from the ordered molecular motions of TPEF induced by LPF/DPF, highly organized aggregates have been progressively assembled in a controlled manner with differentiated morphologies, including spherical particles, one&#8208;dimensional fibers, and floor&#8208;shaped supercrystals. Notably, increasing level of ordered aggregates, in turn, led to quenching emissions, while the CPL signals have been dramatically amplified accompanying by a sharp enhancement of luminescence dissymmetry factors (glum) from nearly 0 to &#8722;0.1. The significant amplification of CPL is attributed to the ordered aggregates of supramolecules, leading to the decrease of electric transition dipole moments in supramolecular system. As a result of the chiral supramolecular motions powered by supramolecular crystallization, the supramolecular motions are conveniently discriminated by visual CPL signal variation with an enhancement of glum value from 0 to &#8722;0.1 in real time.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral macrocyclic dimers, trimers, and tetramers composed of paraphenylene and tethered binaphthyl were synthesized, and their molecular structures and chiroptical properties were investigated. X&#8208;ray analysis and theoretical calculations revealed that multiple twisted molecular structures&#8212;dimer, trimer, and tetramer&#8212;adopt figure&#8208;eight, M&#246;bius triangle, and concave rectangle, respectively. These homologues provide large e values in their absorption spectra because of the &#960;&#8208;conjugation of the naphthalene&#8208;phenylene&#8208;naphthalene frameworks. Owing to the shape&#8208;persistent ring structure and tethering with &#8208;OCH  2  CH  2  O&#8208;, high fluorescence quantum yields and a relatively high dissymmetry factor  g  CPL  in circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectra were achieved.&#160;This results in CPL brightness (  B  CPL  ) over 100, which is greater than that of the conventional organic CPL&#8208;dye.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing the effect of surface composition on multiwalled carbon nanotubes supported Pt&#8208;Fe alloy electrocatalysts for methanol oxidation performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The designs of efficient and inexpensive Pt&#8208;based catalysts for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) are essential to boost the commercialization of direct methanol fuel cells. Here, the highly catalytic performance PtFe alloys supported on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) decorating nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (NC) have been successfully prepared via co&#8208;engineering of the surface composition and electronic structure. The Pt  1  Fe  3  @NC/MWCNTs catalyst with moderate Fe  3+  feeding content (0.86 mA/mg  Pt  ) exhibits 2.26&#8208;fold enhancement in MOR mass activity compared to pristine Pt/C catalyst (0.38 mA/mg  Pt  ). Furthermore, the CO oxidation initial potential of Pt  1  Fe  3  @NC/MWCNTs catalyst is lower relative to Pt/C catalyst (0.71 V and 0.80 V). Benefited from the optimal surface compositions, the anti&#8208;corrosion ability of MWCNT, strong electron interaction between PtFe alloys and MWCNTs and the N&#8208;doped carbon (NC) layer, the Pt  1  Fe  3  @NC/MWCNTs catalyst presents an improved MOR performance and anti &#8208; CO poisoning ability. This study would open up new perspective for designing efficient electrocatalysts for the DMFCs field.</dc:description>

         <title>Intermetallic Nanocrystals: Seed&#8208;Mediated Synthesis and Applications in Electrocatalytic Reduction Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, intermetallic nanocrystals (IMNCs) have attracted extensive attention in the field of electrocatalysis. However, precise control over the size, shape, composition, structure and exposed crystal facet of IMNCs seems to be a challenge to the traditional method of high&#8208;temperature annealing although these parameters have a significant effect on the electrocatalytic performance. Controllable synthesis of IMNCs by the wet chemistry method in the liquid phase shows great potential compared with the traditional high&#8208;temperature annealing method. In this review, we attempt to summarize the preparation of IMNCs by the seed&#8208;mediated synthesis in the liquid phase, as well as their applications in electrocatalytic reduction reactions. Several representative examples are purposely selected for highlighting the huge potential of the seed&#8208;mediated synthesis approach in chemical synthesis. Specifically, we personally perceive the seed&#8208;mediated synthesis approach as a promising tool in the future for precise control over the size, shape, composition, structure, and exposed crystal facet of IMNCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade Reaction in Water to Imidazo[1,2a]pyridazines as Switchable DSEgens, AIEgens, and ACQgens</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dual&#8208;state emission (DSE) luminophores exhibit strong emissions in both solution and solid states, filling the gaps between aggregation&#8208;induced emissions (AIE) and aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ). However, limited design concepts and complicated synthetic strategies restrict the discovery of novel DSE molecules. Developing efficient and green methodologies to access novel DSE scaffolds  via  rational design remains highly desirable. In this work, we report a water&#8208;promoted Pd&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction for the synthesis of multi&#8208;substituted imidazo[1,2&#8208;  a  ]pyridazine derivatives with DSE properties. The intramolecular interactions of the neighboring benzene rings restrict molecular motion, leading to emissions in the solid state(quantum yield: 11%), and the newly constructed core structure of imidazo[1,2&#8208;  a  ]pyridazine ensures considerable planarity, allowing for emissions in solution. Further removal of the neighboring phenyl groups resulted in ACQgens, while additional methyl groups led to AIEgens. Subsequent live cell imaging investigations suggested that the novel DSEgens could serve as specific lipid droplet (LD) probes in a wide concentration range.</dc:description>

         <title>A Vicinal Diol Approach for the Total Synthesis of Molestin E, ent&#8208;Sinulacembranolide A and ent&#8208;Sinumaximol A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The convergent total synthesis of furanocembranoids (FC) molestin E, ent&#8208;sinulacembranolide A and ent&#8208;sinumaximol A was achieved in 20&#8211;21 steps in the longest linear sequence (LLS). Building blocks were coupled through a furan metalation sequence and macrocycle formation was effected by Shiina lactonisation. The primary target molestin E was elaborated late&#8208;stage to 12 novel FC compounds.







Abstract
In this work an approach for the synthesis of furanocembranoid natural products containing the C&#8208;7,8&#8208;diol moiety is disclosed. This culminated in the first total synthesis of the natural product molestin E, together with ent&#8208;sinulacembranolide A and ent&#8208;sinumaximol A as well as a thorough exploration of their chemistry. Late&#8208;stage ring&#8208;closure of the C&#8208;7,8&#8208;diols to the corresponding epoxides was also demonstrated. Key features of this synthetic strategy include a stereoselective Baylis&#8208;Hillman reaction, ring&#8208;closing metathesis and Shiina macrolactonisation. Chiral&#8208;pool materials were deployed to ensure the desired absolute stereochemistry which was confirmed by late&#8208;stage single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Investigation of an Azaoxyallyl Cation&#8208;Templated Intramolecular Aryl Amination Leading to Oxindole Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detailed investigation on the reactivity of &#945;&#8208;arylated azaoxyallyl cation undergoing intramolecular nucleophilic aryl&#8208;amination under catalyst&#8208;free conditions is presented. Azaoxyallyl cation&#8208;guided ortho&#8208;activation of the adjacent aromatic ring is central to this process aided by HFIP. This reaction manifold offers broad access to oxindole derivatives.







Abstract
Herein, development and detailed investigation of a SN&#8242;&#8208;type intramolecular aromatic substitution reaction involving &#945;&#8208;arylazaoxyallyl cation intermediate, is disclosed. The study showcased that while &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;chlorohydroxamate could be activated by a combination of base and 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (HFIP) into the corresponding azaoxyallyl cations, it could further emerge into a &#960;&#8208;extended species involving the adjacent &#945;&#8208;aryl moiety, and this transition is contingent on electronic effects of the aromatic ring as well as on &#945;&#8208;substituents. An effective activation of the &#945;&#8208;aromatic ring could pave the path for intramolecular Ar(Csp2)&#8208;N bond formation towards oxindoles. Control experiments and DFT calculations suggested that a non&#8208;pericyclic nucleophilic amination pathway is most likely operative and precluded the possibility of concerted or electrophilic amination mechanism. HFIP as the reaction solvent plays pivotal roles in the transformation.

         <title>Stabilization of Extra&#8208;Large&#8208;Pore Zeolite by Boron Substitution for the production of commercially applicable catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boron substitution stabilizes the extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore zeolite EWT and increases its thermal stability to 850&#8201;&#176;C. B atoms preferentially substitute the interrupted Q3 sites and are partially converted into 3&#8208;coordination to relax framework deformation upon heating. After Al&#8208;reinsertion post&#8208;treatment, it shows higher ethylbenzene selectivity and ethylene conversion rate than commercial ZSM&#8208;5 and Beta zeolite in benzene alkylation reaction.







Abstract
Stable extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore zeolites are desirable for industrial purposes due to their ability to accommodate bulky reactants and diffusion through channels. Although there are several extra&#8208;large pore zeolites reported, stable ones are rare. Thus, their stabilization is a feasible strategy for industrial applications. Here, an extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore zeolite EWT with boron substitution is presented, and the resulting zeolite B&#8208;RZM&#8208;3 increased the thermal stability from 600&#8201;&#176;C in its silica form to 850&#8201;&#176;C. The crystal structure, determined by combining continuous rotation electron diffraction (cRED) and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD), shows that B atoms preferentially substitute the interrupted (HO)T(OT)3 (Q3) sites and are partially converted into 3&#8208;coordination to relax framework deformation upon heating. After Al&#8208;reinsertion post&#8208;treatment, Al&#8208;B&#8208;RZM&#8208;3 shows higher ethylbenzene selectivity and ethylene conversion rate per mol acid site than commercial ZSM&#8208;5 and Beta zeolite in benzene alkylation reaction. Synthesizing extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore zeolite in borosilicate form is a potential approach to stabilize interrupted zeolites for commercial applications.

         <title>Differential Tunneling&#8208;Driven and Vibrationally&#8208;Induced Reactivity in Isomeric Benzazirines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quantum mechanical tunneling of heavy&#8208;atoms and vibrational excitation chemistry are unconventional and scarcely explored types of reactivity. Once fully understood, they might bring new avenues to conduct chemical transformations, providing access to a new world of molecules or ways of exquisite reaction control. In this context, we present here the discovery of two isomeric benzazirines exhibiting differential tunneling&#8208;driven and vibrationally&#8208;induced reactivity, which constitute exceptional results for probing into the nature of these phenomena. The isomeric 6&#8208;fluoro&#8208; and 2&#8208;fluoro&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2  H  &#8208;benzazirines (  3&#8208;a  and  3'&#8208;s  ) were generated in cryogenic krypton matrixes by visible&#8208;light irradiation of the corresponding triplet nitrene  3  2&#8208;a  , which was produced by UV&#8208;light irradiation of its azide precursor. The  3'&#8208;s  was found stable under matrix dark conditions, whereas  3&#8208;a  spontaneously rearranges (&#964;  1/2  ~64 hours at 10 and 20 K) by heavy&#8208;atom tunneling to  3  2&#8208;a  . Near&#8208;IR&#8208;light irradiation at the first OH stretching overtone frequencies (remote vibrational antenna) of the benzazirines induces the  3'&#8208;s  ring&#8208;expansion reaction to a seven&#8208;member cyclic ketenimine, but the  3&#8208;a  undergoes 2  H  &#8208;azirine ring&#8208;opening reaction to triplet nitrene  3  2&#8208;a  . Computations demonstrate that  3&#8208;a  and  3'&#8208;s  have distinct reaction energy profiles, which explain the different experimental results. The spectroscopic direct measurement of the tunneling of  3&#8208;a  to  3  2&#8208;a  constitutes a unique example of an observation of a species reacting only by nitrogen tunneling. Moreover, the vibrationally&#8208;induced sole activation of the most favorable bond&#8208;breaking/bond&#8208;forming pathway available for  3&#8208;a  and  3'&#8208;s  provides pioneer results regarding the selective nature of such processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Sterically and electronically flexible pyridylidene amine dinitrogen ligands at palladium: hemilabile cis/trans coordination and application in dehydrogenation catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ligand design is crucial for the development of new catalysts and materials with novel properties. Here we describe the synthesis and unique hemilabile coordination properties of new bispyridylidene amine (bis&#8208;PYE) ligands to palladium, and preliminary catalytic activity of these complexes in formic acid dehydrogenation. The synthetic pathway to form cationic complexes [Pd(bisPYE)Cl(L)]X with a  cis  &#8208;coordinated  N,N&#8208;  bidentate bis&#8208;PYE ligand is flexible and provides access to a diversity of Pd(II) complexes with different ancillary ligands (L = pyridine, DMAP, PPh  3  , Cl, P(OMe)  3  ). The  1  H NMR chemical shift of the  trans  &#8208;positioned PYE N&#8211;CH  3  unit is identified as a convenient and diagnostic handle to probe the donor properties of these ancillary ligands and demonstrates the electronic flexibility of the PYE ligand sites. In the presence of a base, the originally  cis  &#8208;coordinated bis&#8208;PYE ligand adopts a  N,N,N  &#8208;tridentate coordination mode with the two PYE units in mutual  trans  position. This  cis&#8208;trans  isomerization is reverted in presence of an acid, demonstrating a unique structural and steric flexibility of the bis&#8208;PYE ligand at palladium in addition to its electronic adaptability. The palladium complexes are active in formic acid dehydrogenation to H  2  and CO  2  . The catalytic performance is directly dependent on the ligand bonding mode, the nature of the ancillary ligand, the counter anion, and additives. The most active system features a bidentate bisPYE ligand, PPh  3  as ancillary ligand and accomplishes turnover frequencies up to 525 h  &#8722;1  in the first hour and turnover numbers of nearly 1000, which is the highest activity reported for palladium&#8208;based catalysts so far.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical synthesis of fluorinated allyl silanes and boronates was disclosed. The addition of electrogenerated boryl or silyl radicals onto many &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl or &#945;&#8208;difluoromethylstyrenes in an undivided cell allowed the formation of a large panel of synthetically useful  gem  &#8208;difluoro and &#947;&#8208;fluoroallyl boronates and silanes (64 examples, from 31% to 95% yield). In addition, a scale up of the reactions under continuous flow was showcased using an electrochemical reactor with promising volumetric productivity (688 g.L  &#8208;1  .h  &#8208;1  and 496 g.L  &#8208;1  .h  &#8208;1  ). Moreover, the synthetic utility of these building blocks was highlighted through versatile transformations. Finally, plausible reaction mechanisms were suggested to explain the formation of the products.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Au(I) Alkynyl Emitters: Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence and Solution&#8208;Processed OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;coordinate donor&#8208;metal&#8208;acceptor type coinage metal complexes displaying efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) have been unveiled to be highly appealing candidates as emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Herein a series of green to yellow TADF gold(I) complexes with alkynyl ligands has been developed for the first time. The complexes exhibit high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of up to 0.76 in doped films (5 wt% in PMMA) at room temperature. The modifications of alkynyl ligands with electron&#8208;donating amino groups together with the use of electron&#8208;deficient carbene ligands induce ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer excited states that give rise to TADF emission. Spectroscopic and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the roles of electron&#8208;donating capability of the alkynyl ligand in tuning the excited&#8208;state properties. Solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) using the present complexes as emitters achieve maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of up to 20%.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Helicenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Helicenes and helicene&#8208;like molecules, usually containing multiple  ortho  &#8208;fused aromatic rings, possess unique helical chirality. These compounds have found a wide range of important applications in many research fields, such as asymmetric catalysis, molecular recognition, sensors and responsive switches, circularly polarized luminescence materials and others. However, the catalytic enantioselective synthesis of helicenes was largely underexplored, when compared with the enantioselective synthesis of molecules bearing other stereogenic elements (e.g. central chirality and axial chirality). Since the pioneer work of asymmetric synthesis of helicenes via enantioselective [2+2+2] cycloaddition of triynes by Star&#225; and Star&#253;, last two decades have witnessed the tremendous development in the catalytic enantioselective synthesis of helicenes. In this review, we comprehensively summarized the advances in this field, which include methods enabled by both transition metal catalysis and organocatalysis, and provide our perspective on its future development.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microbial electro&#8208; and photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction represents an opportunity to tackle the environmental demand for sustainable fuel production. Nanomaterials critically impact the electricity&#8208; and solar&#8208;driven microbial CO2 reduction processes. This minireview comprehensively summarizes the recent developments in the configuration and design of nanomaterials for enhanced the bacterial adhesion and extracellular electron transfer (EET) processes, based on the modification technologies of improving chemical stability, electrochemical conductivity, biocompatibility, and surface area. Furthermore, we detail the investigation of incorporating non&#8208;photosynthetic microorganisms using advanced light&#8208;harvesting nanostructured photoelectrodes for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion, as well as the current understanding of EET mechanisms occurring at photosynthetic semiconductor nanomaterials&#8208;bacteria biohybrid interface. The crucial factors influencing the performance of microbial CO2 reduction systems and future perspectives are discussed to provide guidance for the realization of their large&#8208;scale application.</dc:description>

         <title>Proteophenes &#8211; Amino Acid Functionalized Thiophene&#8208;based Fluorescent Ligands for Visualization of Protein Deposits in Tissue Sections with Alzheimer's Disease Pathology</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proteophenes. A palette of fluorescent thiophene&#8208;based ligands with distinct amino acid side&#8208;chain functionalities along the conjugated backbone was synthesized. Ligands with specific side&#8208;chain functionalities displayed selectivity towards distinct protein aggregates in tissue sections with Alzheimer's disease pathology. We foresee that proteophenes will significantly expand the toolbox of ligands for fluorescent assignment of disease&#8208;associated protein aggregates.







Abstract
Protein deposits composed of specific proteins or peptides are associated with several neurodegenerative diseases and fluorescent ligands able to detect these pathological hallmarks are vital. Here, we report the synthesis of a class of thiophene&#8208;based ligands, denoted proteophenes, with different amino acid side&#8208;chain functionalities along the conjugated backbone, which display selectivity towards specific disease&#8208;associated protein aggregates in tissue sections with Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. The selectivity of the ligands towards AD associated pathological hallmarks, such as aggregates of the amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptide or tau filamentous inclusions, was highly dependent on the chemical nature of the amino acid functionality, as well as on the location of the functionality along the pentameric thiophene backbone. Finally, the concept of synthesizing donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor proteophenes with distinct photophysical properties was shown. Our findings provide the structural and functional basis for the development of new thiophene&#8208;based ligands that can be utilized for optical assignment of different aggregated proteinaceous species in tissue sections.

         <title>Bimetallic Ruthenium Nitrosyl Complexes with Enhanced Two&#8208;Photon Absorption Properties for Nitric Oxide Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitric oxide delivery: A series of bimetallic RuNO complexes with quadrupolar electronic structures exhibit TPA cross&#8208;section up to 1523&#8197;GM under irradiation at &#955;=700&#8197;nm, in the therapeutic window of transparency of biological tissues. The biologically active nitric oxide radical (NO&#8901;) is released in any case.







Abstract
One monometallic and three bimetallic ruthenium nitrosyl (RuNO) complexes are presented and fully characterized in reference to a parent monometallic complex of formula [FTRu(bpy)(NO)]3+, where FT is a fluorenyl&#8208;substituted terpyridine ligand, and bpy the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine. These new complexes are built with the new ligands FFT, TFT, TFFT, and TF&#8208;CC&#8208;TF (where an alkyne C&#8801;C group is inserted between two fluorenes). The crystal structures of the bis&#8208;RuNO2 and bis&#8208;RuNO complexes built from the TFT ligand are presented. The evolution of the spectroscopic features (intensities and energies) along the series, at one&#8208;photon absorption (OPA) correlates well with the TD&#8208;DFT computations. A spectacular effect is observed at two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) with a large enhancement of the molecular cross&#8208;section (&#963;TPA), in the bimetallic species. In the best case, &#963;TPA is equal to 1523&#177;98&#8197;GM at 700&#8197;nm, in the therapeutic window of transparency of biological tissues. All compounds are capable of releasing NO&#8901; under irradiation, which leads to promising applications in TPA&#8208;based drug delivery.

         <title>Improving Photocatalytic Performance through the Construction of a Supramolecular Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular organic framework&#8208;type photocatalyst is constructed by host&#8208;guest complexation. Benefiting from the multivalent supramolecular assembly, it exhibits a higher effective concentration of catalytic sites and better stability to temperature, substrate, and light irradiation. As a result, the supramolecular organic framework shows improved catalytic performance in the photocatalytic oxidation of aryl boronic acids and thioethers.







Abstract
A supramolecular organic framework&#8208;type photocatalyst, named TM&#8208;SOF, is constructed by the self&#8208;assembly of cucurbit[8]uril and a tetra&#8208;arm monomer containing four N, N&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl 2,5&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridinium)thiazolo[5,4&#8208;d]thiazole (MPT) moieties. Benefiting from the multivalent assembly, a photocatalytically active supramolecular MPT dimer can be stably formed in TM&#8208;SOF. In addition, TM&#8208;SOF exhibits better stability against temperature, substrate, and light irradiation. As a result, TM&#8208;SOF shows a significantly improved performance for the photocatalytic aerobic oxidation of aryl boronic acids and thioethers. It is anticipated that this line of research will provide a facile approach for fabricating high&#8208;performance supramolecular photocatalysis systems.

         <title>Recent Progress of Phosphoric Acid Retention in High Temperature Proton Exchange Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Great efforts have been conducted to develop high temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell (HT&#8208;PEMFC) due to its features of enhanced electrocatalyst reactivity, simplified hydrothermal management system and high CO tolerance of catalysts, and remarkable progress has been achieved. However, the easy leaching of phosphoric acid (PA) from the membranes&#160;during operation limits its commercial scale&#8208;up in complicated environments. This concept here mainly focuses on the recent developments for mitigation of PA loss in PA doped PEMs. The probably mechanisms of PA loss are proposed. The approaches to improve PA retention e.g. via introduction of phosphonic acid by covalent bond, using ion&#8208;pairs interaction and siphoning effect, and blending with inorganic nanoparticles are described in detail. Among these strategies, the siphoning effect from the intrinsic microporous PEMs is the most efficient and enables the cell to operate flexibly within a broad temperature range. Therefore, this concept may provide new ideas for the scientists to retain PA, to improve the cell performance and expand the potential applications of PA doped PEMs at elevated humidity and wide temperature range.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing Water to Enhance Quadrupolar NMR Spectroscopy and Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>17  O and  14  N are attractive targets for  in vivo  NMR spectroscopy and imaging, but low gyromagnetic ratios &#947; and fast spin relaxation complicate these observations. This work explores indirect ways for detecting some of these sites with the help of proton&#8208;detected double resonance techniques. As standard coherence transfer methods are of limited usefulness for such indirect detections, alternative routes for probing the quadrupolar spectra on  1  H were tested. These centered on modulating the broadening effects imparted onto protons adjacent to the low&#8208;g species via J&#8208;couplings through either continuous wave or spin&#8208;echo double resonance decoupling/recoupling sequences. As in all cases the changes imparted by these double&#8208;resonance strategies were small due to the fast relaxation undergone by the quadrupoles, the sensitivity of these approaches was amplified by porting their effects onto the abundant water  1  H signal. These amplifications were mediated by the spontaneous exchanges that the labile  1  Hs bound to  17  O or  14  N undergo with the water protons. In experiments designed on the basis of double&#8208;resonance spin echoes, these enhancements were imparted by looping the transverse encodings together with multiple longitudinal storage periods, leading to Decoupling&#8208;Recoupling with EXchange (D&#8208;REX) sequences. In experiments designed on the basis of continuous on/off quadrupolar decoupling, these solvent exchanges were incorporated into chemical&#8208;exchange saturation transfer schemes, leading to Decoupling&#8208;Recoupling with Saturation Transfer (D&#8208;REST) sequences.&#160; Both of these variants harnessed sizable proportions of the easily detectable water signals, in order to characterize the NMR spectra and/or to image with atomic&#8208;site specificity the  17  O and  14  N species.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Multichromophoric systems showing both fluorescence and photoisomerization are fascinating, with complex interchromophoric interactions. The experimental and theoretical study of a series of compounds, bearing a variable number of 4&#8208;dicyanomethylene&#8208;2&#8208;  tert  &#8208;butyl&#8208;6&#8208;(  p  &#8208;(  N  &#8208;(2&#8208;azidoethyl)&#8208;  N  &#8208;methyl) aminostyryl)&#8208;4H&#8208;pyran (DCM) units are reported. The photophysical properties of multi&#8208;DCM derivatives, namely  2DCM  and  3DCM  , were compared to the single model azido&#8208;functionalized  DCM  , in the  E  and  Z  isomers. The (  EE  )&#8208;  2DCM  and (  EEE  )&#8208;  3DCM  were synthesized  via  the click reaction. Steady&#8208;state spectroscopy and photokinetics experiments under UV or visible irradiation indicated the presence of intramolecular energy transfer processes among the DCM units. Homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;energy transfer processes between adjacent chromophores were confirmed by fluorescence anisotropy and decays. Molecular dynamics simulations for  2DCM  were carried out and analyzed using a Markov state model, providing geometrical parameters (orientation and distance between chromophores) and energy transfer efficiency. This work contributes to a better understanding and rationalization of multiple energy transfer processes occuring within multichromophoric systems.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Bismuth&#8208;oxygen&#160;moieties are beneficial for high&#8208;efficiency CO  2  RR producing formate, however, the preservation of bismuth&#8208;oxygen&#160;moietyis challenging while applying a cathodic potential. This work reports&#160;preparation of ultrathin Bi  2  O  2  O/Bi  2  O  2  (OH)(NO  3  )&#160;nanosheets&#160;(BiON&#8208;uts)  via  &#160;in&#8208;situ&#160;tailoring hydrogen bonds&#160;in Bi  2  O  2  (OH)(NO  3  ) precursor.&#160;The&#160;BiON&#8208;uts exhibits&#160;a&#160;formate faradaic efficiency of 98%&#160;with higher partial current density than that&#160;of&#160;most&#160;reported Bi&#8208;based catalysts. Mechanistic&#160;studies demonstrate that the ultrathin nanosheet morphology facilitates ion&#8208;exchange reaction between BiON&#8208;uts and electrolyte to produce Bi  2  O  2  CO  3  &#160;intermediate, and adsorption&#160;reaction of CO  2  &#160;with surface Bi  2  O  2  O. DFT calculations reveal that the rate&#8208;limiting first electron transfer is effectively improved because of the high electron affinity of Bi  2  O  2  CO  3  . More importantly, high&#8208;efficiency CO  2  RR in turn protects bismuth&#8208;oxygen&#160;moieties from being reduced and thus&#160;helps to maintain&#160;excellent CO  2  RR activity.&#160;This work offers an interactive mechanism of CO  2  RR promotion and bismuth&#8208;oxygen&#160;moiety preservation, opening up&#160;new opportunities&#160;for developing high&#8208;performance catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Magnetic Hyperthermia Enhancement in Iron&#8208;based Materials Driven by Carbon Support Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Magnetic hyperthermia (MH) shows a great potential in clinical applications because of its very localized action and minimal side effects. Because of their high saturation magnetization values, reduced forms of iron are promising candidates for MH. However, their protection is mandatory to overcome their toxicity and instability (i. e. oxidation) in biological conditions. In this work, a novel methodology for the protection of iron nanoparticles through confinement within graphitic carbon layers after thermal treatment of preformed nanoparticles supported on carbon is reported. We demonstrate that the size and composition of the nascent confined iron nanoparticles and the thickness of their protective carbon layer can be controlled by selecting the nature of the carbon support. Our findings reveal that a higher nanoparticle&#8208;carbon interaction mediated by the presence of oxygen&#8208;containing groups, induces the formation of small and well&#8208;protected &#945; &#8208;Fe&#8208;based nanoparticles, which exhibit promising results towards MH based on their enhanced specific absorption rate&#160;values.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of 3&#8208;Borylated Pyrrolidines by 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition of Alkenyl Boronates and Azomethine Ylide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable and efficient approach to the synthesis of 3&#8208;borylated pyrrolidine building blocks with various substitution patterns (including fused and spirocyclic sp3&#8208;rich derivatives) through the 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of azomethine ylide is disclosed. The target compounds were prepared on a multigram scale, and their potential for C&#8722;C and C&#8722;heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions is illustrated.







Abstract
A scalable and efficient process for the preparation of 3&#8208;borylated pyrrolidines by 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of N&#8208;benzyl azomethine ylide generated in&#8197;situ has been developed. The optimized method included the use of LiF in DMSO at 110&#8201;&#176;C and was suitable for &#945;&#8208;mono&#8208;, &#945;,&#946;&#8208;di&#8208;, and &#945;,&#946;,&#946;&#8208;trialkyl&#8208;, &#946;,&#946;&#8208;(hetera)cycloalkylidene&#8208;, CO2Et&#8208;, as well as most &#946;&#8208;(het)aryl&#8208;substituted alkenyl boropinacolates. The 1,3&#8208;dipolar reaction proceeded on a multigram scale providing 3&#8208;borylated pyrrolidines with diverse substitution patterns (including fused and spirocyclic ones) in a diastereoselective manner. The Pd(OH)2&#8208;mediated N&#8208;debenzylation of pyrrolidine hydrochlorides was successfully performed to give the corresponding bifunctional building blocks on an up to 130&#8197;g scale, thus providing a substantial expansion of the synthetic and medicinal chemist's toolbox. Other reactions included the preparation of trifluoroborates, Zweifel&#8208;Aggarwal sp3&#8208;sp2 coupling, and oxidative deborylation as an example of C&#8208;heteroatom bond formation.

         <title>Dipole&#8208;Dipole and Anion&#8208;&#960;+ Interaction Manipulation Synergistically Enhance Intrinsic Antibacterial Activities of AIEgens</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic manipulation strategy of dipole&#8208;dipole and anion&#8208;&#960;+ interaction is proposed to enhance the binding affinity of dyes toward pathogenic bacteria and to construct highly efficient luminescence&#8208;guided antimicrobials with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) feature independent of light and the surrounding oxygen.







Abstract
Pathogenic bacteria infections, especially multidrug resistant bacteria infections have aroused worldwide attention due to their severe threats to human beings. Thus, the development of highly effective antibacterial reagents is very important. However, the design of antimicrobials is still quite challenging for the lack of a universal design strategy. Here, a synergistic manipulation strategy of dipole&#8208;dipole and anion&#8208;&#960;+ interaction is proposed for constructing highly efficient antimicrobials with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) feature. Firstly, four anion&#8208;&#960;+&#8208;type AIE luminogens were designed and synthesized. Due to the electron&#8208;donating and hydrophilic characteristic of methoxy groups, 3MOTPO containing three methoxy groups showed the largest dipole moment (5.06 Debye) and dual anion&#8208;&#960;+ interactions in the solid state. Driven by both dipole&#8208;dipole and anion&#8208;&#960;+ interactions, 3MOTPO showed the strongest bacterial binding ability and the best antibacterial activities (MIC90=3.76&#8197;&#956;M). The work offers a deep insight into the rational design of highly efficient antimicrobials for luminescence&#8208;guided antibacterial study.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficient Ultrathin PdCuMo Porous Nanosheets with Abundant Defects for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin PdCuMo porous nanosheets with rich cavities and structural defects have been successfully prepared by a simple method. Due to the novel structures which can provide extensive active sites and the electronic interaction between Cu, Pd and Mo elements, ultrathin PdCuMo porous nanosheets display outstanding catalytic activities and stabilities.







Abstract
To reduce the over&#8208;dependence on Pt, Pd&#8208;based catalysts have become one of the most effective candidates for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In order to further accelerate the ORR kinetics and strengthen the catalytic performance of Pd catalysts, component optimization and morphology design have been adopted. Although great progress has been made, it is still difficult to obtain porous ultrathin nanosheets with excellent performance by a simple method. Here, ultrathin PdCuMo porous nanosheets (PdCuMo NSs) were successfully prepared. This structure possessed a large specific surface area with rich cavities and structural defects, significantly enhancing its ORR performance. In special, the mass activity of PdCuMo NSs was 1.46&#8197;A&#8201;mg&#8722;1 at 0.90&#8197;V, which was 12.2, 8.6, and 2.7&#8197;times as high as that of Pd/C, Pt/C, and PdCuMo nanoparticles (PdCuMo NPs), respectively. In addition, it had an excellent ability to resist CO poisoning and exhibited remarkable long&#8208;term stability.

         <title>Fusion of Aza&#8208; and Oxadiborepins with Furans in a Reversible Ring&#8208;Opening Process Furnishes Versatile Building Blocks for Extended &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Materials</title>

         <dc:description>
Merging furan rings with 1,2,7&#8208;oxa&#8208; and &#8208;azadiborepins. This modular synthesis proceeds through a reversible ring&#8208;opening process and furnishes the novel heteropolyaromatic compounds from a common precursor. The tricyclic systems are overall aromatic, and weak aromaticity in the diboron heterocycles favors &#960; electron delocalization over the bifuran unit. The &#960;&#8208;conjugated system is easily extended through the &#945;&#8208;positions of the furan rings.







Abstract
A modular synthesis of both difurooxa&#8208; and difuroazadiborepins from a common precursor is demonstrated. Starting from 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bifuran, after protection of the positions 5 and 5&#8217; with bulky silyl groups, formation of the novel polycycles proceeds through opening of the furan rings to a dialkyne and subsequent re&#8208;cyclization in the borylation step. The resulting bifuran&#8208;fused diborepins show pronounced stability, highly planar tricyclic structures, and intense blue light emission. Deprotection and transformation into dibrominated building blocks that can be incorporated into &#960;&#8208;extended materials can be performed in one step. Detailed DFT calculations provide information about the aromaticity of the constituent rings of this polycycle.

         <title>A Macrocyclic Furan with Accessible Oxidation States: Switching Between Aromatic and Antiaromatic Global Ring Currents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first macrocyclic furan with accessible oxidation states was synthesized using a post&#8208;macrocyclization approach. It exhibits low oxidation potentials, and switching between antiaromatic and aromatic global ring currents upon oxidation.







Abstract
Macrocyclic furans are predicted to switch between global aromaticity and antiaromaticity, depending on their oxidation states. However, the macrocyclic furans reported to date are stabilized by electron withdrawing groups, which result in inaccessible oxidation states. To circumvent this problem, a post&#8208;macrocyclization approach was applied to introduce methylene&#8208;substituted macrocyclic furans, which display an extremely low oxidation potential of &#8722;0.23 vs. Fc/Fc+, and are partially oxidized in ambient conditions. Additional oxidation to the dication results in aromaticity switching to a global 30&#960;e&#8722; aromatic state, as indicated by the formation of a strong diatropic current observed in the 1H&#8197;NMR spectrum. NICS and ACID calculations support this trend and provide evidence for a different pathway for the global current in the neutral and dicationic states. According to these findings, macrocyclic furans can be rendered as promising p&#8208;type materials with stable oxidation states.

         <title>[Nb@Ge13/14]3&#8722;: New Family Members of Ge&#8208;Based Intermetalloid Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new clusters [Nb@Ge13]3&#8722; and [Nb@Ge14]3&#8722; were successfully synthesized; they represent the first 13&#8208; and 14&#8208;vertex endohedral Ge cages. HOMO&#8208;2 orbital of [Nb@Ge13]3&#8722; (left) shows a bonding character with respect to the shortest Nb&#8722;Ge contact, whereas the analogous HOMO&#8208;2 orbital of [Nb@Ge14]3&#8722; (right) shows anti&#8208;bonding character over the related fragment.







Abstract
During the past two decades, single&#8208;atom&#8208;centered medium&#8208;sized germanium clusters [M@Gen] (M=transition metals, n&gt;12) have been extensively explored, both from theoretical perspectives and experimental gas&#8208;phase syntheses. However, the actual structural arrangements of the Ge13 and Ge14 endohedral cages are still ambiguous and have long remained an unresolved problem for experimental implementation. In this work, we successfully synthesize 13&#8208;/14&#8208;vertex Ge clusters [Nb@Ge13]3&#8722; (1) and [Nb@Ge14]3&#8722; (2), which are structurally characterized and exhibit unprecedented topologies, neither classical deltahedra nor 3&#8208;connected polyhedral structures. Theoretical analysis indicates that the major stabilization of the Ge backbones arises due to the substantial interaction of Ge 4p&#8208;AOs with the endohedral Nb 4d&#8208;AOs through three/four&#8208;center two&#8208;electron bonds with an enhanced electron density accumulated over the shortest Nb&#8722;Ge13 contact in 1. Low occupancies of the direct two&#8208;center two&#8208;electron (2c&#8211;2e) Nb&#8722;Ge and Ge&#8722;Ge &#963; bonds point to a considerable degree of electron delocalization over the Ge cages revealing their electron deficiency.

         <title>Enhanced Optical Properties of Azaborole Helicenes by Lateral and Helical Extension</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#960;&#8208;Extended Azaborole Helicenes. A unique set of &#960;&#8208;extended azaborole helicenes, assembled from N&#8208;heteroaromatic and dibenzo[g,p]chrysene building blocks, shows excellent optical properties. The lateral and helical extensions of the helicene scaffold significantly enhanced emission quantum yields and dissymmetry factors.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of laterally extended azabora[5]&#8208;, &#8208;[6]&#8208; and &#8208;[7]helicenes, assembled from N&#8208;heteroaromatic and dibenzo[g,p]chrysene building blocks is described. Formally, the &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems of the pristine azaborole helicenes were enlarged with a phenanthrene unit leading to compounds with large Stokes shifts, significantly enhanced luminescence quantum yields (&#934;) and dissymmetry factors (glum). The beneficial effect on optical properties was also observed for helical elongation. The combined contributions of lateral and helical extensions resulted in a compound showing green emission with &#934; of 0.31 and |glum| of 2.2&#215;10&#8722;3, highest within the series of &#960;&#8208;extended azaborahelicenes and superior to emission intensity and chiroptical response of its non&#8208;extended congener. This study shows that helical and lateral extensions of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems are viable strategies to improve features of azaborole helicenes. In addition, single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis of configurationally stable [6]&#8208; and &#8208;[7]helicenes was used to provide insight into their packing arrangements.

         <title>Single&#8208;Layer 2D Ni&#8722;BDC MOF Obtained in Supercritical CO2&#8208;Assisted Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chip off the old MOF: A CO2 molecule can exchange with the lattice&#8208;coordinated H2O molecules and side&#8208;on coordinate with the metal Ni sites on Ni&#8722;BDC surface simultaneously; finally this breaks the interlayer hydrogen bond of bulk Ni&#8722;BDC and helps to form 2D MOF.







Abstract
The development of an efficient strategy for fabricating two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) nanosheets with high yield and high stability is desirable. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that large, single&#8208;layer 2D nickel&#8208;benzene dicarboxylate (Ni&#8722;BDC) MOF nanosheets can be fabricated with the assistance of supercritical (SC) CO2 in a pure aqueous system. Detailed experimental evidence reveals that the SC CO2 molecule can exchange with the lattice&#8208;coordinated H2O molecules, side&#8208;on coordinate with the metal Ni1 sites on the Ni&#8722;BDC surface, and finally break the interlayer hydrogen bond to exfoliate the bulk Ni&#8722;BDC into a 2D MOF. More importantly, a thin SC CO2 layer building up at the water&#8722;Ni&#8722;BDC interfaces can transform the pristine hydrophilic interface into a super&#8208;hydrophobic one. This super&#8208;hydrophobic layer at the water&#8208;MOF interface can effectively prevent dissociation, thus promoting the stability of Ni&#8722;BDC in aqueous system.

         <dc:description>
Trifluoromethylselenolation of vinylic substrates was performed through a palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation. This reaction was based on the use of 5&#8208;methoxy&#8208;8&#8208;amino&#8208;quinoline as directing group and trifluoromethyl tolueneselenosulfonate as trifluoromethylselenolating reagent. This method was also extended to fluoroalkylselenolation reactions.







Abstract
Trifluorometylselenolation via C&#8722;H activation is barely described in literature. In particular, no such vinylic functionalization has been yet described. Herein, a palladium&#8208;catalyzed trifluoromethylselenolation of vinylic C&#8722;H bonds is described. The 5&#8208;methoxy&#8208;8&#8208;aminoquinoline has been used as auxiliary directing group to perform this reaction. The reaction gives excellent yields with &#945;&#8208;substituted compounds whatever the substituents and a microwave activation can be used to accelerate the reaction. With &#946;&#8208;substituted substrates lower yields, but still satisfactory, are obtained. This methodology was also successfully extended to other fluoroalkylselenyl groups.

Combustion time! The synthesis of a &#948;&#8208;ketohydroperoxide is described, addressing the compatibilities of ketones and hydroperoxides in these elusive combustion&#8208;relevant species. The hydroperoxide is installed through sulfonylhydrazine substitution, in which it is found that 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane is an advantageous medium for the transformation. The synthesis is scalable and safe, providing material for future chemical kinetics studies.







Abstract
A synthesis of a &#948;&#8208;ketohydroperoxide is described, addressing potential functional&#8208;group compatibilities in these elusive species relevant to combustion and atmospheric chemistries. The hydroperoxide is installed via sulfonylhydrazine substitution, which was found to be more effective than displacement of secondary halides. As part of this protocol, it was observed that 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane is an advantageous medium for the reaction, avoiding the formation of a tetrahydrofuran hydroperoxide side product. This discovery facilitated the multigram synthesis (6&#8197;steps, 41&#8201;% yield overall) and discrete characterization of the target &#948;&#8208;ketohydroperoxide.

         <title>Acid&#8208;Modulated Synthesis of Novel &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Microporous Polymers for Efficient Metal&#8208;Free Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an approach to construct two structurally different (&#946;&#8208;ketoenamine and boranil&#8208;based) CMPs from identical monomers via simple acid modulation (BF3.Et2O and CH3COOH). The polymers display distinctly different optical and electronic properties. Boranil CMP display superior photocatalytic activity producing hydrogen at a superior rate of 252&#8197;&#956;mol/g over &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine polymer (100&#8197;&#956;mol/g).







Abstract
Simple synthetic modifications that tune the molecular structures, thereby the properties of the molecules, are of topical interest. Herein, we report the synthesis of two novel cationic rosaniline&#8208;based conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) from identical monomers via simple acid modulation (Acetic acid and BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Et2O). The condensation reaction of rosaniline with 2,4,6&#8208;triformylphloroglucinol in acetic acid renders &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked CMP (CMP&#8208;A) while changing the acid to BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Et2O, the linkages transform to enol and undergoes BF2&#8208;complexation, leading to boranil CMP (CMP&#8208;B). BF2&#8208;functionalities in boranil CMP significantly modified the optical and functional properties compared to &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked CMP. The cationic&#8208;delocalization along with the extended &#960;&#8208;delocalization supported by chromophoric BF2&#8208;groups allow CMP&#8208;B to exhibit broad absorption spanning the visible to Near&#8208;Infrared region (NIR). The absorption red&#8208;edge of CMP&#8208;B appears around 1277&#8197;nm (optical band gap &#8764;1.58&#8197;eV) while CMP&#8208;A displays at 981&#8197;nm (optical band gap &#8764;1.83&#8197;eV). Most interestingly, as a photocatalyst, CMP&#8208;B catalyzes hydrogen evolution with a superior rate of 252&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 over CMP&#8208;A (100&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1). It is about 2.5&#8197;times higher performance. The transient photocurrent measurements, electrochemical impedance data, and in&#8208;depth mott&#8208;Schottky analysis demonstrate that the BF2&#8208;group in CMP&#8208;B generates photoinduced charge carriers and their migration towards the active sites for photocatalysis. These polymers show significant photocatalytic H2 generation without any supportive metal co&#8208;catalyst. The BF2 complexed building blocks are a unique class of metal&#8208;free photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution through green and cost&#8208;effective approach.

         <title>Photocatalytic Reduction of Nicotinamide Co&#8208;factor by Perylene Sensitized RhIII Complexes
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a catalytically active intramolecular photocatalyst, which combines a perylene photosensitizer and a RhIII catalyst. Spectroscopic studies reveal the formation of a charge&#8208;separated perylene radical cation&#8208;RhII intermediate that results in a catalytically active species in the presence of protons.







Abstract
The ambitious goal of artificial photosynthesis is to develop active systems that mimic nature and use light to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. Intramolecular design concepts are particularly promising. Herein, we firstly present an intramolecular photocatalyst integrating a perylene&#8208;based light&#8208;harvesting moiety and a catalytic rhodium center (RhIIIphenPer). The excited&#8208;state dynamics were investigated by means of steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved absorption and emission spectroscopy. The studies reveal that photoexcitation of RhIIIphenPer yields the formation of a charge&#8208;separated intermediate, namely RhIIphenPer.+, that results in a catalytically active species in the presence of protons.

         <title>Cucurbit[7]uril&#8208;Encapsulation&#8208;Controlled Supramolecular Photoproduct and Radical Fluorescence Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Control and stabilize: A host&#8211;guest interaction controlled photoproduct and organic radical fluorescence emission by using cucurbit[7]uril (Q[7])&#8208;based pseudorotaxane structures is reported. Tetrakis(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)ethylene (TPyE) derivatives can be assembled as cationic guests by the Q[7] host to form a [5]pseudorotaxane in aqueous solution. The host stabilizes the radical fluorescence emission of the photoirradiation&#8208;triggered intermediate of the guest, thus implying that the macrocyclic assembly has potential applications in the development of luminescent radical materials.







Abstract
Herein, a host&#8211;guest interaction&#8211;controlled photoproduct created by using cucurbit[7]uril (Q[7])&#8208;based pseudorotaxane structures is reported. The assembly exhibited controlled behavior towards the reduction of the ethylene (C=C) bond in the tetrakis(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)ethylene (TPyE) guest molecule under UV light irradiation. This can be attributed to the Q[7] encapsulation masking the four pyridinium arms of the guest, which inhibits planarization of the TPyE core to form the cyclization product. In particular, the strong affinity of Q[7] for the butyl&#8208;substituted guest (TPyE&#8208;4C) led to an unusual radical fluorescence emission of the photoirradiation&#8208;triggered intermediate of the guest molecule being observed in aqueous solution. This work provides a valuable paradigm and new insight for macrocycle&#8208;based host&#8722;guest interactions in supramolecular catalysis and luminescent radical materials.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Control and stabilize&lt;/b&gt;: A host&#8211;guest interaction controlled photoproduct and organic radical fluorescence emission by using cucurbit[7]uril (Q[7])-based pseudorotaxane structures is reported. Tetrakis(pyridin-4-yl)ethylene (TPyE) derivatives can be assembled as cationic guests by the Q[7] host to form a [5]pseudorotaxane in aqueous solution. The host stabilizes the radical fluorescence emission of the photoirradiation-triggered intermediate of the guest, thus implying that the macrocyclic assembly has potential applications in the development of luminescent radical materials.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, a host&#8211;guest interaction&#8211;controlled photoproduct created by using cucurbit[7]uril (Q[7])-based pseudorotaxane structures is reported. The assembly exhibited controlled behavior towards the reduction of the ethylene (C=C) bond in the tetrakis(pyridin-4-yl)ethylene (TPyE) guest molecule under UV light irradiation. This can be attributed to the Q[7] encapsulation masking the four pyridinium arms of the guest, which inhibits planarization of the TPyE core to form the cyclization product. In particular, the strong affinity of Q[7] for the butyl-substituted guest (TPyE-4C) led to an unusual radical fluorescence emission of the photoirradiation-triggered intermediate of the guest molecule being observed in aqueous solution. This work provides a valuable paradigm and new insight for macrocycle-based host&#8722;guest interactions in supramolecular catalysis and luminescent radical materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
2D ultrathin metal&#8211;organic layers (MOLs) with bis&#8208;metallic sites have been developed for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction. The expanded checkerboard represents the 2D MOL structure. The two differently colored pawns represent bis&#8208;metallic sites, the cream one being responsible for transferring electrons to CO2, and the cyan one denoting protons coupling with CO2. The ingenious layout makes them work synergistically resulting in a magical effect that is crucial for efficient CO2 photoreduction to CO.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Linker Containing Detergents for Membrane Protein Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is pressing but still challenging to explore the structure and function of membrane proteins (MPs). One of the main obstacles lies in the limited availability of matched detergents in the handling of the specific MPs. We describe herein a new design of detergent by the incorporation of a transition linker between the hydrophilic head and the hydrophobic tail. This design allows a gradual change of hydrophobicity between outside and inside of micelles, in contrast to the abrupt switch in conventional detergents. Notably, many of these detergents assembled into micelles in smaller sizes while retaining the low critical micelle concentrations. Meanwhile, thermal stabilizing evaluation identified superior detergents for representative MPs, including G protein&#8208;coupled receptors and a transporter protein. Among them, selected detergent further improved the NMR study of MPs. We anticipate these optimal results would encourage future detergent expansion through the new remodeling on the traditional detergent scaffold.</dc:description>

         <title>1,2,5&#8208;Triarylcycloalka[c]arsoles: Structural Effects of Fused&#8208;cycloalkanes on Stability and Photophysical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we have synthesized a variety of cycloalkane&#8208;fused arsoles. Cyclopentane and cyclohexane were incorporated into the cycloalkane&#8208;fused arsoles. Surprisingly, cyclohexane&#8208;fused arsole  2a  gradually decomposed via oxidative ring&#8208;opening under ambient conditions, while cyclopentane&#8208;fused  1a  was stable. In addition, the Stokes shift of  2a  (7766 cm  &#8211;1  ) is larger than that of  1a  (5120 cm  &#8211;1  ). The effects of the fused cycloalkane on the stability and photophysical properties were attributed to the distortion of the cycloalkane. Computational calculations demonstrated that the cyclohexane moiety in  2a  was frustrated upon being incorporated into the rigid arsole ring, while the cyclopentane moiety in  1a  was much less distorted.</dc:description>

         <title>Shedding Light on the Enigmatic TcO2&#183;xH2O Structure with Density Functional Theory and EXAFS Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The &#946;&#8208;emitting  99Tc isotope is a high&#8208;yield fission product in  235U and  239Pu nuclear reactors, raising special concern in nuclear waste management due to its long half&#8208;life and the high mobility of pertechnetate (TcO4&#8722;  ). In the conditions of deep nuclear waste repositories, retention of Tc is achieved via biotic and abiotic reduction of TcO4&#8722;  to compounds like amorphous TcO2&#183;xH2O precipitates. It is generally accepted that these precipitates have linear (Tc(&#956;&#8208;O)2(H2O)2)n  chains, with trans H2O. Although corresponding Tc&#8208;Tc and Tc&#8208;O distances have been obtained from Extended X&#8208;ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy, this structure is largely based on analogy with other compounds. Here, we combine Density&#8208;Functional Theory with EXAFS measurements of fresh and aged samples to show that, instead, TcO2&#183;xH2O forms zigzag chains that undergo a slow aging process whereby they combine to form longer chains and, later, a tridimensional structure that might lead to a new TcO2  polymorph.</dc:description>

         <title>Effective Charge Carrier Utilization of BiVO4 for Solar Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solar energy&#8208;driven overall water splitting (OWS) is an attractive way for generating green hydrogen. This review focuses on the current research status of BiVO4&#8208;constituted photo(electro)catalytic OWS systems, and summarizes the effective strategies for BiVO4 photo(electro)catalysts in a mainline of efficient charge utilization. It is hoped to provide comprehensive guidance for the construction of advanced solar OWS systems.







Abstract
Solar energy&#8208;driven overall water splitting (OWS) is an attractive way for generating clean and renewable green hydrogen. One key challenge is the construction of OWS systems with high solar energy conversion efficiencies, in which how to manipulate photoexcited charge carriers to efficiently participate in the reaction is the top priority. In recent years, bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) has emerged as one of the most promising materials for photo(electro)catalytic OWS and considerable progress has been achieved. In this review, recent advances of BiVO4&#8208;constituted OWS systems in both photoelectrocatalytic and photocatalytic approaches are presented in a mainline of effective charge carrier utilization. Various strategies for improved charge carrier utilization, including band structure engineering, improving charge separation, reducing charge recombination, and accelerating reaction kinetics, are summarized and analyzed in detail. Finally, perspective and outlook on further exploring the application potential of BiVO4 are proposed.

Stacking is directly proportional to the thickness of 2D moieties. This study showed the tuning of stacking among metal&#8208;organic layers (MOLs) which leads to regulate the thickness of 2D stacked MOFs. Integration of variable chemical structs in linkers of MOFs, is found to be a crucial factor to tune the stacking trend.







Abstract
Thickness of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) govern their intriguing functionalities. Primarily this thickness is controlled by the stacking between the metal&#8208;organic layers (MOL). It is observed that until now such modulating factors for stacking efficiency of MOL are not well studied. Here, we report a fundamental hypothesis to comprehend regulation of stacking efficiency among MOLs as a function of chemical structure of organic ligands (dicarboxylic acids and pillar linkers). This basically involves a series of isostructural three&#8208;dimensional (3D) MOFs which contain linkers of variable chemical nature that could be depillared to generate 2D stacked MOFs of different thickness. Depending on the linkers, we encountered the formation of single MOL to stacked multiple MOLs as evidenced from atomic force microscopic and other experimental analysis. The present study gives a concrete correlation between the stacking within 2D MOFs (from monolayer to multilayers), and their 3D counter parts, which may provide a thickness tuning pathway for 2D MOFs.

         <title>Two novel three&#8208;dimensional Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based rare earth MOFs with ultra&#8208;high proton conductivity and performance stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, the two examples of La(III) based&#160;MOFs (rare earth based metal organic frameworks), Eu&#8208;ETTB and Gd&#8208;ETTB, were obtained by self&#8208;assembly. Both materials showed extremely high proton conductivity, where the proton conductivity value of Eu&#8208;ETTB was 1.53 &#215; 10&#8722;2 S/cm at 98% relative humidity (RH) and 85 &#176;C, while Gd&#8208;ETTB had a proton conductivity value of 2.63 &#215; 10&#8722;2 S/cm at 98% RH and 75 &#176;C. This was almost the best performance observed for three&#8208;dimensional porous MOFs without post&#8208;synthetic modification and was based on milder conditions than most materials. Furthermore, cycle test experiment and continuous work test showed that both materials had excellent performance both in terms of stability and durability. Water vapor adsorption experiment showed that a large number of water molecules are adsorbed, the hydrogen bond network was rebuilt by the adsorbed water molecules in the pore channel and optimized the channels for proton transfer, explained its high performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Sulfur Atoms on TADF Properties from Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer Excited States</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The harnessing of heavy atom effect of chalcogen elements offers a way for boosting the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) of purely organic luminescent materials that can harvest triplet excitons. However, the conformational and electronic variations induced by the heavy and large atoms may also have adverse effects on the TADF properties. Herein, the design, synthesis, and structures of a new type of through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) emitters containing benzothiazino[2,&#8203;3,&#8203;4&#8208;&#8203;kl]&#8203;phenothiazine (DPTZ) as the donor unit are reported. The influences of S atoms on the emission properties have been systematically investigated by means of theoretical simulations, electrochemical and spectroscopic studies. Although the presence of &#960;&#8208;stacking interactions and calculated spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) values are beneficial for TSCT&#8208;TADF properties, the triplet TSCT states are uplifted to above the locally excited LE state of the acceptor moieties. As a result, the new emitters display longer delayed fluorescence lifetimes (&#964;  DF  ) of 255.0&#8210;114.3 &#956;s and lower PLQYs of 45&#8210;61% in comparison with the O&#8208;containing congeners (&#964;  DF  = 26.9&#8210;6.8 &#956;s; PLQYs = 74&#8210;71%). This work highlights that a full consideration of various effects is essential when making use of heavy chalcogen atoms for the design of TADF emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Oxygen Configuration in Hierarchically Porous Carbon Nanosheets for High&#8208;Rate and Durable Na+ Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface oxygen functionalities (particularly C&#8722;O configuration) in carbon materials have negative influence on their electrical conductivity and Na+ storage performance. Herein, we propose a concept from surface chemistry to regulate the oxygen configuration in hierarchically porous carbon nanosheets (HPCNS). It is demonstrated that the C&#8722;O/C=O ratio in HPCNS reduces from 1.49 to 0.43 and its graphitization degree increases by increasing the carbonization temperature under a reduction atmosphere. Remarkably, such high graphitization degree and low C&#8722;O content of the HPCNS&#8208;800 are favorable for promoting its electron/ion transfer kinetics, thus endowing it with high&#8208;rate (323.6 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.05 A g&#8722;1 and 138.5 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20.0 A g&#8722;1) and durable (96% capacity retention over 5700 cycles at 10.0 A g&#8722;1) Na+ storage performance. This work permits the optimization of heteroatom configurations in carbon for superior Na+ storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Fabrication of Highly Luminescent and Thermally Stable Phosphors through In&#8208;Situ Formation of BaSO4 on Sulfur Nanodots</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly luminescent and thermally stable hybrid phosphors of sulfur nanodots@BaSO4 were fabricated through an in&#8197;situ precipitation method. Sulfur nanodots are incorporated in the matrix of BaSO4, and BaSO4 provides passivation effect for surface ligands or traps, resulting in the promotion of photoluminescence quantum yield from 23&#8201;% to 58&#8201;%, and the BaSO4 matrix also leads to promotion of thermal stability.







Abstract
Producing high performance phosphors using abundant and non&#8208;toxic precursors yet straightforward methods are promising but still a challenging task. Herein, highly luminescent and thermally stable phosphors were fabricated through an in&#8197;situ precipitation synthesis strategy. Sulfur nanodots (S&#8208;dots) act as the precursors for precipitation reactions and also provide the luminescent centers. Structural and optical characterization investigations suggest that S&#8208;dots are incorporated in the matrix of BaSO4, and BaSO4 provides passivation effect for the surface ligands or traps of S&#8208;dots. This results in the promotion of photoluminescence quantum yield from 23&#8201;% to 58&#8201;%, and the BaSO4 matrix also leads to the obvious promotion of thermal stability. These merits endow the construction of phosphor&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes by utilizing the S&#8208;dots@BaSO4 hybrid phosphors as a color conversion layer. These research results are significant for developing sulfur&#8208;based luminescent materials, and also provide a solid and universal theory to produce high quality phosphors.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling of Thioesters and Organomanganese Reagents
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article discloses the development of an iron(III)&#8208;catalyzed coupling of thioesters with aliphatic organomanganese reagents. The good functional group tolerance resulted in successful transformation of a range of thioesters, including biologically relevant compounds. The presence of accessible &#946;&#8208;hydrogen atom in the organomanganese reagent seems crucial for an effective catalyst activation. The liberated thiolate stabilizes the generated alkylferrate(II) species.







Abstract
We report a Fukuyama&#8208;type coupling of thioesters with aliphatic organomanganese reagents utilizing a cheap and easily available iron(III) precatalyst. The reactions exhibit a wide tolerance of solvents and functional groups, allowing for the conversion of thioesters derived from natural products and pharmaceutical compounds. A strong steric impact from each reaction component (carboxylic moiety, thiol substituent and manganese reagent) was displayed, which enabled regioselective transformation of dithioesters. Mechanistic investigations showed that the released thiolate does not act as a mere spectator ligand, but rather positively influences the stability of intermediate alkyl(II)ferrates.

Move along!: Herein, we report the B(C6F5)3&#8208;catalyzed E&#8208;selective isomerization of alkenes. The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free method is applicable across a diverse array of readily accessible substrates, accessing a broad range of synthetically useful products containing versatile stereodefined internal alkenes. Synthetic and computational mechanistic studies indicate that the isomerization proceeds along competing 1,2&#8208;hydride shift and hydride abstraction pathways.

         <title>Influence of the Intramolecular Hydrogen Bond on the Fluorescence of 2&#8208;ortho&#8208;Aminophenyl Pyridines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular hydrogen bonds play an important role in the fluorescence of 2&#8208;ortho&#8208;aminophenyl pyridines, shifting the emission colour from deep blue to cold white. These multi&#8208;emissive dynamic systems bearing excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) moieties are susceptible to pH. The cover feature illustrates how DFT and td&#8208;DFT calculations can elucidate why different levels of protonation lead to different emission colours. Photochemists are depicted as sailing through the waves of a spectrum. More information can be found in the Research Article by A.&#8197;M.&#8197;S. Silva, S. Guieu, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201844).

         <title>Heterobimetallic Gold/Ruthenium Complexes Synthesized via Post&#8208;functionalization and Applied in Dual Photoredox Gold Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acting in concert: Novel heterobimetallic AuI/RuII complexes synthesized in a Diels&#8208;Alder reaction are reported. The applied post&#8208;functionalization strategy allows which isomer is obtained to be controlled. Their application as catalysts in carbon&#8208;phosphorus cross&#8208;coupling showed that the dinuclear complexes can outperform their monometallic counterparts







Abstract
The synthesis of heterobimetallic AuI/RuII complexes of the general formula syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;[{AuCl}(L1&#8745;L2){Ru(bpy)2}][PF6]2 is reported. The ditopic bridging ligand L1&#8745;L2 refers to a P,N hybrid ligand composed of phosphine and bipyridine substructures, which was obtained via a post&#8208;functionalization strategy based on Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between a phosphole and a maleimide moiety. It was found that the stereochemistry at the phosphorus atom of the resulting 7&#8208;phosphanorbornene backbone can be controlled by executing the metal coordination and the cycloaddition reaction in a different order. All precursors, as well as the mono&#8208; and multimetallic complexes, were isolated and fully characterized by various spectroscopic methods such as NMR, IR, and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy as well as cyclic voltammetry. Photophysical measurements show efficient phosphorescence for the investigated monometallic complex anti&#8208;[(L1&#8745;L2){Ru(bpy)2}][PF6]2 and the bimetallic analogue syn&#8208;[{AuCl}(L1&#8745;L2){Ru(bpy)2}][PF6]2, thus indicating a small influence of the {AuCl} fragment on the photoluminescence properties. The heterobimetallic AuI/RuII complexes syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;[{AuCl}(L1&#8745;L2){Ru(bpy)2}][PF6]2 are both active catalysts in the P&#8208;arylation of aryldiazonium salts promoted by visible light with H&#8208;phosphonate affording arylphosphonates in yields of up to 91&#8201;%. Both dinuclear complexes outperform their monometallic counterparts.

         <title>Boosting the Enantioselectivity of Conjugate Borylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Disubstituted Cyclobutenones with Monooxides of Chiral C2&#8208;Symmetric Bis(phosphine) Ligands</title>

A chiral bis(phosphine) monooxide (BPMO) derived from a C2&#8208;symmetric bis(phosphine) ligand does magic to the copper&#8208;catalyzed conjugate borylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted cyclobutenones. Yields and levels of stereoselection, especially enantioselectivity, are exceedingly high (see scheme).







Abstract
Chiral bis(phosphine) monooxides (BPMOs) derived from C2&#8208;symmetric bis(phosphines) have been found to induce superior levels of enantioselection in copper&#8208;catalyzed conjugate borylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted cyclobutenones. More precisely, enantiomeric excesses as well as chemical yields are exceedingly high with (R,R)&#8208;Bozphos as the chiral ligand while these values are low with parent (R,R)&#8208;Me&#8208;Duphos. A similar yet less pronounced effect was seen in the corresponding 1,6&#8208;addition to para&#8208;quinone methides.

A transition metal&#8208;free method for the trans&#8208;hydroboration of 1,3&#8208;diynes to afford (E)&#8208;1&#8208;boryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;enynes is reported. Boron adds to the external carbon of the diyne framework. Experimental and DFT studies suggest that phosphine attack on the diyne is a key step in the catalytic cycle.







Abstract
We report a transition metal&#8208;free, regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selective, phosphine&#8208;catalyzed method for the trans hydroboration of 1,3&#8208;diynes with pinacolborane that affords (E)&#8208;1&#8208;boryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;enynes. The reaction proceeds with excellent selectivity for boron addition to the external carbon of the 1,3&#8208;diyne framework as unambiguously established by NMR and X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies. The reaction displays a broad substrate scope including unsymmetrical diynes to generate products in high yield (up to 95&#8201;%). Experimental and theoretical studies suggest that phosphine attack on the alkyne is a key process in the catalytic cycle.

         <title>Metalloenzyme&#8208;Mediated Thiol&#8208;Yne Addition Towards Photoisomerizable Fluorescent Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regioselective metalloenzyme&#8208;directed synthesis of a vinyl sulfide&#8208;based inhibitor, which has shown to be involved in an unexpected Z to E photoisomerization process, is reported. Tuning of the spectral features guided by theoretical studies revealed structural modifications for effective bidirectional photoconversion of thermally bistable vinyl sulfide diastereoisomers, while maintaining the high biological activity of the parent inhibitor.







Abstract
Proteins are able to irreversibly assemble biologically active ligands from building blocks bearing complementary reactive functions due their spatial proximity, through a kinetic target&#8208;guided synthetic process (also named in&#8197;situ click chemistry). Although linkages thus formed are mostly passive, some of them have shown to significantly contribute to the protein binding through for instance hydrogen bonding and stacking interactions. Biocompatible reactions and click chemistry are a formidable source of inspiration for developing such new protein&#8208;directed ligations. This study reports a proximity&#8208;induced thiol&#8208;yne synthesis of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Not only this example widens the arsenal of kinetic target&#8208;guided synthesis (KTGS) eligible reactions, but the obtained product displayed unsuspected photophysical properties. The corresponding vinyl sulfide linkage conjugated to a coumarin core proved to be engaged in a monodirectional Z to E photoisomerization process. Further investigations guided by theoretical calculations showed that fine&#8208;tuning of the nature of the substituents on the coumarin moiety allows to obtain a bidirectional photochemical process, thus discovering a new photoswitching moiety, displaying moreover fluorescence properties. Due to the spectral tunability of coumarin derivatives, this work should open new opportunities for the design of vinyl sulfide&#8208;based photoswitch systems with modular photophysical properties.

         <title>Synthesis of Cage&#8208;Shaped Borates Bearing Pyrenylmethyl Groups: Efficient Lewis Acid Catalyst for Photoactivated Glycosylations Driven by Intramolecular Excimer Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cage&#8208;shaped borate 3aB having pyrenylmethyl groups was synthesized. The obtained 3aB functioned as a photoactivated Lewis acid catalyst. The photoactivation originates from the deformation of the cage&#8208;shaped scaffold driven by intramolecular excimer formations of the pyrenes, allowing the catalytic O&#8208;glycosylation using glycosyl fluorides to proceed with a high efficiency.







Abstract
We describe the synthesis and characterization of a photoactivated boron&#8208;based Lewis acid catalyst based on a cage&#8208;shaped triphenolic ligand with three pyrenylmethyl moieties. The obtained cage&#8208;shaped borate functioned as a photoactivated Lewis acid catalyst thanks to the flexible three pyrenylmethyl moieties. The deformation of the cage&#8208;shaped scaffold driven by intramolecular excimer formations of the pyrenes is a critical factor in realizing the photoactivation. Mannich&#8208;type reactions and glycosylations significantly were accelerated under 370&#8197;nm light irradiations. It is noteworthy that various glycosyl fluorides, which are not easily activated in photocatalytic systems due to their high C&#8722;F bond stability, are activated by the photoimproved catalytic activity of the catalyst.

         <title>Controlling Electronic Events Through Rational Structural Design in Subphthalocyanine&#8211;Corrole Dyads: Synthesis, Characterization, and Photophysical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of covalently linked subphthalocyanine&#8211;corrole (SubPc&#8208;Cor) dyads have been prepared. In four of the reported examples, Cor.+&#8208;SubPc.&#8722; charge&#8208;separated states have been observed, whereas in the case of the electron&#8208;rich SubPc and the electron&#8208;deficient Cor dyad, only energy transfer has been detected.







Abstract
Porphyrinoids are considered perfect candidates for their incorporation into electron donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) arrays due to their remarkable optoelectronic properties and low reorganization energies. For the first time, a series of subphthalocyanine (SubPc) and corrole (Cor) were covalently connected through a short&#8208;range linkage. SubPc axial substitution strategies were employed, which allowed the synthesis of the target molecules in decent yields. In this context, a qualitative synthetic approach was performed to reverse the expected direction of the different electronic events. Consequently, in&#8208;depth absorption, fluorescence, and electrochemical assays enabled the study of electronic and photophysical properties. Charge separation was observed in cases of electron&#8208;donating Cors, whereas a quantitative energy transfer from the Cor to the SubPc was detected in the case of electron accepting Cors.

         <title>Synthesis of Metal Chalcogenide Semiconductors by Thermal Decomposition of Organosulfur and Organoselenium Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable and facile solid&#8208;state synthesis method using thiourea has been investigated to obtain chalcogenide semiconductors, such as CdSxSe1&#8208;x solid solution. Thiourea was found to work as a molten reaction medium at moderate temperature, although it leaves organic residues in the solid phase.







Abstract
Metal chalcogenides &#8211; because of their excellent optical and electrical properties &#8211; are important semiconductor materials for optical devices, such as solar cells, sensors, and photocatalysts. The challenges associated with metal chalcogenides are the complexity of the conventional synthesis methods and the stringent synthesis conditions. In this study, the synthesis conditions were simplified in a solvent&#8208;free synthesis method using cadmium precursor, thiourea and selenium to synthesize metal chalcogenides, such as CdS and CdSe, which have particularly suitable band gaps for the optical devices. CdSxSe1&#8208;x solid solution was successfully synthesized under molten thiourea as the reactive reaction medium at relatively low temperatures, even at 180&#8201;&#176;C, with residual melamine derivatives in the solid phase. The luminescence properties of CdSxSe1&#8208;x and the products in the gas and solid phases were investigated. Optimization of the synthesis conditions for solid solutions of CdSxSe1&#8208;x and the role of organic compounds in the formation of metal chalcogenides are discussed.

         <title>Catalysis by [Ga4L6]12&#8722; Metallocage on the Nazarov Cyclization: The Basicity of Complexed Alcohol is Key</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Nazarov cyclization process performed inside a metallocage is much faster than in solution. This is mainly due to the change of basicity of the substrate (an alcohol) once encapsulated.







Abstract
The Nazarov cyclization is investigated in solution and within K12[Ga4L6] supramolecular organometallic cage by means of computational methods. The reaction needs acidic condition in solution but works at neutral pH in the presence of the metallocage. The reaction steps for the process are analogous in both media: (a) protonation of the alcohol group, (b) water loss and (c) cyclization. The relative Gibbs energies of all the steps are affected by changing the environment from solvent to the metallocage. The first step in the mechanism, the alcohol protonation, turns out to be the most critical one for the acceleration of the reaction inside the metallocage. In order to calculate the relative stability of protonated alcohol inside the cavity, we propose a computational scheme for the calculation of basicity for species inside cavities and can be of general use. These results are in excellent agreement with the experiments, identifying key steps of catalysis and providing an in&#8208;depth understanding of the impact of the metallocage on all the reaction steps.

         <title>Bioorthogonal Click of Colloidal Gold Nanoparticles to Antibodies In vivo</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining nanotechnology and bioorthogonal chemistry. Due to their size, nanomedicines target tumors passively. Whereas bioorthogonal chemistry allows for a pretargeting approach. Herein, we demonstrate &#8208; for the first time &#8208; the possibility to successfully ligate Tz&#8208;AuNPs in&#8197;vivo to pretargeted monoclonal antibodies.







Abstract
Combining nanotechnology and bioorthogonal chemistry for theranostic strategies offers the possibility to develop next generation nanomedicines. These materials are thought to increase therapeutic outcome and improve current cancer management. Due to their size, nanomedicines target tumors passively. Thus, they can be used for drug delivery purposes. Bioorthogonal chemistry allows for a pretargeting approach. Higher target&#8208;to&#8208;background drug accumulation ratios can be achieved. Pretargeting can also be used to induce internalization processes or trigger controlled drug release. Colloidal gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have attracted widespread interest as drug delivery vectors within the last decades. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the possibility to successfully ligate AuNPs in&#8197;vivo to pretargeted monoclonal antibodies. We believe that this possibility will facilitate the development of AuNPs for clinical use and ultimately, improve state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art patient care.

         <dc:description>The strongly oxidizing, powerful electrophilic fluorination reagent [FXe][OTf] is shown to effect direct oxidative monofluorination of sulfoxides. This one&#8208;step, chloride promoter&#8208;free methodology provides access to so far inaccessible, yet highly desirable strongly Lewis acidic fluorosulfoxonium cations from electron&#8208;deficient and/or sterically demanding sulfoxides that are shown to be practically unreactive towards the previously reported XeF2/NEt4Cl system. Experimental and density functional theory studies have been conducted to assess the Lewis acidities of the prepared sulfur(VI) cations. Preliminary results obtained with chiral sulfoxides provide early insights into the mechanism of these fluorination reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Functional Liquid Crystal Elastomers Based on Dynamic Covalent Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of advanced liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) with dynamic nature is of paramount significance for a new generation of "smart" applications such as soft robotics, 3D/4D printing, adaptive camouflage, and beyond. The marriage with emerging dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) is known to endow the LCEs with exciting functional behaviors, hardly seen in ordinary LCEs, such as reprogramming, reprocessing, chemical recycling, and self&#8208;healing properties. In this review, we address a systematic overview of LCEs based on DCC, starting with a brief introduction to the structural properties of traditional LCEs and their conventional synthetic chemistries. Emphasis is then on the chemistry of the dynamic covalent bonds (DCBs) so far found in LCEs, focusing on the exchangeable reaction mechanisms, alignment fundamentals, and the influence of composition and topology of the polymer LCE system on their ultimate dynamic properties. Finally, future challenges and opportunities in the development of promising dynamic LCEs and their potential applications are discussed. This review is expected to provide new insights into the development of intelligent liquid crystalline materials that embraces chemistry, nanoscience, materials science, device engineering, and nanotechnology.</dc:description>

Finally, future challenges and opportunities in the development of promising dynamic LCEs and their potential applications are discussed. This review is expected to provide new insights into the development of intelligent liquid crystalline materials that embraces chemistry, nanoscience, materials science, device engineering, and nanotechnology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dynamic Timing Control of Molecular Photoluminescent Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic control of molecular photoluminescence offers chemical solutions for designing functional emissive materials. Although stimuli&#8208;switchable molecular luminescent systems have been well established, it remains challenging how to encode these dynamic emissive systems in a &#8220;timing&#8221; manner, i.e., time&#8208;dependent luminescent properties. This Concept aims at summarizing the design principles of dynamic timing molecular photoluminescent systems by discussing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progresses of this topic and shaping the fabrication strategies at both molecular and supramolecular levels. Outlook and perspectives are given to outline the future opportunities and challenges on the rational design and potential applications of these smart emissive systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Solution structure of a lanthanide&#8208;binding DNA aptamer determined using high quality pseudocontact shift restraints</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this contribution we report the high&#8208;resolution NMR structure of a recently identified lanthanide&#8208;binding aptamer (LnA). We demonstrate that the rigid lanthanide binding by LnA allows for the measurement of anisotropic paramagnetic NMR restraints which to date remain largely inaccessible for nucleic acids. One type of such restraints &#8208; pseudocontact shifts (PCS) induced by four different paramagnetic lanthanides &#8208; was extensively used throughout the current structure determination study and the measured PCS turned out to be exceptionally well reproduced by the final aptamer structure. This finding opens the perspective for a broader application of paramagnetic effects in NMR studies of nucleic acids through the transplantation of the binding site found in LnA into other DNA/RNA systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Controlled Selective Mono vs Di&#8208;ortho&#8208;Arylation for the Synthesis of Arylhydrazine Derivatives.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the method of palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H arylation assisted with 3,4,4&#8208;trimethylpyrazol&#8208;5&#8208;on directing group providing selectively mono&#8208; and di&#8208;  ortho  &#8208;arylated products. Steric hindrance appearing between the directing group and the already introduced aryl substituent enables control of mono  vs  diarylation selectivity by the temperature of the reaction. Taking advantage of this, a series of monosubstituted and disubstituted derivatives were obtained in good yields. Moreover, unsymmetrical double&#8208;arylation in a one&#8208;pot procedure was developed to give corresponding products in reasonable yields. Additionally, synthesis and X&#8208;ray study of intermediate palladium metallacycles of both, the first and second arylation reactions, were conducted. X&#8208;ray structure comparison emphasizes the geometrical differences that were consistent with the observed reactivity. Finally, decarboxylative cleavage of the pyrazolone directing group under mild conditions gave synthetically useful hydrazones. The presented solution opens the alternative synthetic way to such  ortho  arylated derivatives of arylhydrazines.</dc:description>

         <title>Enabling Aromatic Hydroxylation in a Cytochrome P450 Monooxygenase Enzyme through Protein Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cytochrome P450 (CYP) family of heme monooxygenases catalyse the selective oxidation of C&#8208;H bonds under ambient conditions. The CYP199A4 enzyme from  Rhodopseudomonas palustris  catalyses aliphatic oxidation of 4&#8208;cyclohexylbenzoic acid but not the aromatic oxidation of 4&#8208;phenylbenzoic acid, due to the distinct mechanisms of aliphatic and aromatic oxidation.&#160;The aromatic substrates 4&#8208;benzyl&#8208;, 4&#8208;phenoxy&#8208; and 4&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;benzoic acid and methoxy&#8208;substituted phenylbenzoic acids were assessed to see if they could achieve an orientation more amenable to aromatic oxidation. CYP199A4 could catalyse the efficient benzylic oxidation of 4&#8208;benzylbenzoic acid. The methoxy substituted phenylbenzoic acids were oxidatively demethylated with low activity. However, no aromatic oxidation was observed with any of these substrates. Crystal structures of CYP199A4 with 4&#8208;(3&#162;&#8208;methoxyphenyl)benzoic acid demonstrated that the substrate binding mode was like that of 4&#8208;phenylbenzoic acid. 4&#8208;Phenoxy&#8208; and 4&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;benzoic acid bound with the ether or ketone oxygen atom hydrogen&#8208;bonded to the heme aqua ligand. We also investigated if the substitution of phenylalanine residues in the active site could permit aromatic hydroxylation. Mutagenesis of the F298 residue to a valine did not significantly alter the substrate binding position or enable the aromatic oxidation of 4&#8208;phenylbenzoic acid. The F182L mutant was able to catalyse 4&#8208;phenylbenzoic acid oxidation generating 2'&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;, 3'&#8208;hydroxy&#8208; and 4'&#8208;hydroxy metabolites in a 83:9:8 ratio, respectively. Molecular dynamics simulations, in which the distance and angle of attack were considered, demonstrated that in the F182L variant, in contrast to the wild&#8208;type enzyme, the phenyl ring of 4&#8208;phenylbenzoic acid attained a productive geometry for aromatic oxidation to occur.</dc:description>

         <title>Computational insights of selective intramolecular O&#8208;atom transfer mediated by bioinspired copper complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stereoselective copper&#8208;mediated hydroxylation of intramolecular C&#8208;H bonds from tridentate ligands is reinvestigated using DFT calculations. The computational study aims at deciphering the mechanism of C&#8208;H hydroxylation obtained after reaction of Cu(I) precursors with dioxygen, using ligands bearing either activated (  L  1  ) or non&#8208;activated (  L  2  ) C&#8208;H bonds. Configurational analysis allows rationalization of the experimentally observed regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. The computed mechanism involves the formation of a&#160;  side&#8208;on  &#160;peroxide species (  P  ) in equilibrium with the key intermediate bis&#8208;(&#956;&#8208;oxo) isomer (  O  ) responsible for the C&#8208;H activation step. The&#160;  P/O  &#160;equilibrium yields the same activation barrier for the two complexes.&#160; However, the main difference between the two model complexes is observed during the C&#8208;H activation step , where the complex bearing the non&#8208;activated C&#8208;H bonds yields a higher energy barrier, accounting for the experimental lack of reactivity of this complex under those conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrostannylation of Red Phosphorus: A Convenient Route to Monophosphines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The preparation of valuable and industrially relevant organophosphorus compounds currently depends on inefficient and indirect multi&#8208;step procedures involving difficult&#8208;to&#8208;handle white phosphorus as a common P atom source, alongside extremely hazardous, toxic, and/or corrosive reactants and intermediates. Herein, we report a practical and versatile method for the synthesis of a variety of monophosphorus compounds directly from the bench&#8208;stable allotrope red phosphorus (P red ). The productive functionalisation of relatively inert P red is achieved using the cheap and readily available radical reagent tri&#8208; n &#8208;butyltin hydride, and subsequent treatment with electrophiles yields useful P 1 compounds. Remarkably, these transformations require only modest inert atmosphere techniques and use only reagents that are inexpensive, commercially available, and easy to safely handle, making this a convenient and practical methodology accessible in most laboratory settings.</dc:description>

         <title>Insights into the effect of adsorption preference of additives on the anisotropic growth of ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zeolite morphology plays a crucial role to affect catalytic performance, while it is persistently challenging to tailor via crystal anisotropic growth. It has been recognized that specific additives can be introduced in the synthetic process of zeolites to achieve anisotropic growth, while their role and the underlying mechanism are yet well understood. Herein, the effect of eight specific additives on the anisotropic growth of ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite was unveiled within the framework of crystallization engineering. Either the inhibition effect or the promotion effect is revealed for each additive according to the crystallization kinetics. The adsorption preference of typical additives on different surfaces was demonstrated by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) and transmission X&#8208;ray microscopy (TXM) together with 3D reconstruction. The calculated adsorption energy difference between MFI [100]/[101] and [010] surfaces was proposed as a key descriptor to estimate the possible morphology induced by additive. ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites varying from sphere&#8208;like, plate&#8208;like to noodle&#8208;like morphology could be synthesized by employing specific additives with increasing adsorption strength difference on distinct surfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Chemoselective Catalytic Photooxidations Using Solvent as a Sacrificial Electron Acceptor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:  Catalyst recovery is an integral part of photoredox catalysis. It is often solved by adding another component&#8208;a sacrificial agent&#8208; whose role is to convert the catalyst back into its original oxidation state. However, an additive may cause a side reaction thus decreasing the selectivity and overall efficiency. Herein, we present a novel approach towards chemoselective photooxidation reactions based on suitable solvent&#8208;acetonitrile acting simultaneously as an electron acceptor for catalyst recovery, in combination with anaerobic conditions. This is allowed by the unique properties of the catalyst, 7,8&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;5&#8208;phenyl&#8208;5&#8208;deazaflavinium chloride existing in both strongly oxidizing and reducing forms, whose strength is increased by excitation with visible light. Usefulness of this system is demonstrated in chemoselective dehydrogenations of 4&#8208;methoxy&#8208; and 4&#8208;chlorobenzyl alcohols to aldehydes without over&#8208;oxidation to benzoic acids achieving yields up to 70%. 4&#8208;Substituted 1&#8208;phenylethanols were oxidized to ketones with yields 80&#8208;100% and, moreover, with yields 31&#8208;98% in the presence of benzylic methyl group, diphenylmethane or thioanisole which are readily oxidized in the presence of oxygen but these were untouched with our system. Mechanistic studies based on UV&#8208;VIS spectro&#8208;electrochemistry, EPR and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy measurements showed the process involving an electron release from an excited deazaflavin radical to acetonitrile forming solvated electron is crucial for the catalyst recovery.</dc:description>

Herein, we present a novel approach towards chemoselective photooxidation reactions based on suitable solvent-acetonitrile acting simultaneously as an electron acceptor for catalyst recovery, in combination with anaerobic conditions.

Usefulness of this system is demonstrated in chemoselective dehydrogenations of 4-methoxy- and 4-chlorobenzyl alcohols to aldehydes without over-oxidation to benzoic acids achieving yields up to 70%. 4-Substituted 1-phenylethanols were oxidized to ketones with yields 80-100% and, moreover, with yields 31-98% in the presence of benzylic methyl group, diphenylmethane or thioanisole which are readily oxidized in the presence of oxygen but these were untouched with our system.

         <title>Mechanism of BPh3&#8208;Catalyzed N&#8208;Methylation of Amines with CO2 and Phenylsilane: Cooperative Activation of Hydrosilane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>BPh3 catalyzes the N&#8208;methylation of secondary amines and the C&#8208;methylenation (methylene&#8208;bridge formation between aromatic rings) of N,N&#8208;dimethylanilines or 1&#8208;methylindoles in the presence of CO2 and PhSiH3, and these reactions proceed at 30&#8211;40 &#176;C under solvent&#8208;free conditions. In contrast, B(C6F5)3 shows little or no activity. 11B NMR spectra suggested the generation of [HBPh3]&#8211;. The detailed mechanism of the BPh3&#8208;catalyzed the N&#8208;methylation of N&#8208;methylaniline (1) with CO2 and PhSiH3 was studied by DFT calculations. BPh3 promotes the conversion of two substrates (N&#8208;methylaniline and CO2) into a twitterionic carbamate to give three&#8208;component species [Ph(Me)(H)N+CO2&#8211;&#183;&#183;&#183;BPh3]. The carbamate and BPh3 act as the nucleophile and Lewis acid, respectively, for the activation of PhSiH3 to generate [HBPh3]&#8211;, which is used to produce key CO2&#8208;derived species, such as silyl formate and bis(silyl)acetal, essential for the N&#8208;methylation of 1. DFT calculations also suggested other mechanisms involving water for the generation of [HBPh3]&#8211; species.</dc:description>
