         <title>Bis(phenylsulfonyl)methane (BPSM) as Multifunctional Electrolyte Additive Constructing a Stable Interfaces for LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/graphite batteries at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bis(phenylsulfonyl)methane (BPSM) is used as a functional electrolyte additive to assist in the construction of stable electrode/electrolyte interfacial films to improve the performance of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/graphite batteries at room and low temperatures. And compared to the non&#8208;BPSM&#8208;containing batteries, rate and cycling performance of BPSM&#8208;containing batteries can also be enhanced. After 1200 cycles at 25 &#176;C, the capacity retention of the battery with BPSM increases from 8.68% to 83.07%. After 130 cycles at &#8208;10 &#176;C, the capacity retention of the battery with BPSM increases from 21.01% to 98.97%. The spectroscopic characterizations and theoretical calculations demonstrate that BPSM is preferentially oxidized and reduced on the cathode and anode respectively to construct stable and high&#8208;conductivity electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphase. The enhanced performance reveals that BPSM is an effective film&#8208;forming additive with promising applications in nickel&#8208;rich lithium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Implementation of the Hard&#8208;Soft Acid&#8208;Base Principle for the Direct Synthesis of Bimetallic Zirconium&#8208;Nickel and Hafnium&#8208;Nickel Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks with a Polar Pore Environment</title>

         <dc:description>An important direction in MOFs is the development of materials with well&#8208;defined and ordered heterogeneity towards novel functionalities and control of important properties at the atomic scale. A great approach is the designed synthesis of mixed metal MOFs (M&#8217;MOFs) made of different building units, based on distinct metal cations. However, their in&#8208;situ formation and co&#8208;assembly into an extended crystalline framework present great challenges due to the different kinetic and thermodynamic parameters. We report the successful synthesis of two isostructural, bimetallic Zr&#8208;Ni and Hf&#8208;Ni M&#8217;MOFs following the hard and soft acid and base (HSAB) principle. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed the formation of a 3D structure that features an in&#8208;situ formed [Ni(HPyC)4Cl2]4&#8208; 4&#8208;c non&#8208;planar metallo&#8208;ligand, that bridges 8&#8208;c Zr(Hf)6&#8208;clusters. The resulting (4, 8)&#8208;c scu type framework shows polygonal 1D channels, with a largest pore diameter of approximately 9 &#197;, decorated by Cl&#8208; anions. This polar pore environment was found fully accessible and both materials were investigated for Xe/Kr and CO2/CH4 separation. The results are very promising showing that the IAST selectivity calculated for a 20:80 Xe/Kr molar mixture is 8.2 and 7.1 at 298K for the Zr_Ni&#8208;scu&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 and Hf_Ni&#8208;scu&#8208;MOF&#8208;1, respectively, which is comparable to some of the best performing materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Indole&#8208;2&#8208;Carboxylic Acid Ligand&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Stable Perovskite Nanocrystals for Fast Responsive Photodetector</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cesium lead bromide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) show great potential for photoelectric properties. However, due to their poor stability and the insulating nature of passivating ligands, they suffer from practical applications. Herein, in an approach to passivate NCs surface by introducing a ligand, Indole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid (ICA), we synthesized a mixed CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 NCs by ligand&#8208;assisted re&#8208;precipitation approach. Incorporating ICA ligand in place of long chain insulating Oleic acid (OA) effectively reduced the loss of non&#8208;radiative recombination induced by surface trap states. Through all the performed compositional and structural characterization, the existence of CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 mixed NCs was confirmed. The obtained CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 mixed NCs show green emission at 518 nm and superior stability under ambient conditions compared to CsPbBr3 NCs. The photoluminescence (PL) of the CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 mixed NCs increased approximately three times, and the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) increased from 75 &#177; 2% to 94 &#177; 2% as compared to CsPbBr3 NCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring Self&#8208;Assembled Peptide Hydrogels with Antimicrobial or Cell Adhesive Properties for Tissue Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a simple strategy to generate self&#8208;assembling peptide&#8208;based hydrogels by combining sequences that include a SaU and a bioactive motif &#8208;either cell&#8208;adhesive (RGD) or antimicrobial (LF)&#8208; with HA. The resulting systems form 3D fibrillar networks that are physicochemically characterized and exhibit selective biological functions, supporting their application in tissue engineering and the prevention of biomaterial&#8208;associated infections.








Abstract
Bacterial colonization on biomaterials is a major issue, leading to approximately 20% of implant failures due to infection and biofilm formation. To address this, peptide&#8208;based hydrogels incorporating tailored bioactive peptides have emerged as promising candidates for applications in tissue engineering and infection control. Here, we have designed peptide sequences that incorporate i) a self&#8208;assembling unit (SaU) and ii) bioactive motifs, including the well&#8208;known arginine&#8208;glycine&#8208;aspartate (RGD) sequence to promote cell adhesion or an antimicrobial peptide derived from lactoferrin (LF) to exhibit antibacterial properties. To aid in the gelation, these peptides were combined with hyaluronic acid (HA), rendering peptide&#8208;based hydrogels without the need for additional external assembly triggers, simplifying their application in biomedical contexts. This protocol allowed for a spontaneous formation of a 3D fibrillar network, with structural and physicochemical properties suitable for tissue engineering. The biological evaluation revealed the ability of RGD&#8208;based hydrogels to increase the adhesion and spreading of osteoblastic cells compared to controls, while the LF&#8208;based hydrogels significantly reduced the viability and attachment of both Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative strains, clearly affecting bacterial morphology. This report demonstrates the feasibility of this technology to produce hydrogels incorporating distinct biological cues, highlighting their potential as versatile biomaterials to address diverse biomedical challenges.

         <title>Development of CPA&#8208;Catalyzed &#946;&#8208;Selective Reductive Amination of Cardenolides for the Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Hydrolytically Stable Analogs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a new method to produce hydrolytically stable cardiotonic steroids using a CPA&#8208;controlled diastereoselective reductive amination of cardenolide aglycones. The oleandrin and digitoxigenin analogs exhibited promising activity against various cancer cell lines in the NCI&#8208;60 screen.

This article describes the development of novel, hydrolytically stable cardiotonic steroid analogs featuring a 3&#946;&#8208;amine moiety instead of the commonly found 3&#946;&#8208;carbohydrates such as oleandrose. To establish the desired 3&#946;&#8208;configuration stereoselectively, a new method based on chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;controlled diastereoselective reductive amination with Hantzsch esters was developed. This method utilizes readily available unsubstituted (S)&#8208;BINOL&#8208;based hydrogen phosphate as the catalyst, enabling the synthesis of 13 different 5&#946;&#8208;androsterone and digitoxigenin analogs with up to 36:1&#160;&#946;:&#945; diastereoselectivity. Additionally, this strategy was applied to generate two novel oleandrigenin analogs 15a and 15g in 3 steps from readily available gitoxigenin. The synthetic analogs were subjected to the NCI&#8208;60 human tumor cell lines screen, and several different digitoxigenin derivatives with tumor cell growth inhibitory power in submicromolar range were identified. The subsequent in vitro evaluation of digitoxigenin and oleandrin derivatives 13a, 13g, 15a, and 15g demonstrated that these four analogs reduced steady&#8208;state ATP1A1 levels in T98G cells in the 12&#8211;96&#160;nM range. Interestingly, only the oleandrin analog 15g lowered also steady&#8208;state levels of the cellular prion protein (PrPC), the main therapeutic target for the treatment of prion diseases.

&lt;p&gt;We describe a new method to produce hydrolytically stable cardiotonic steroids using a CPA-controlled diastereoselective reductive amination of cardenolide aglycones. The oleandrin and digitoxigenin analogs exhibited promising activity against various cancer cell lines in the NCI-60 screen. Additionally, nanomolar concentrations of a new oleandrin analog lowered levels of the cellular prion protein in T98G cells.

         <title>Sustainable Approaches for the Protection and Deprotection of Functional Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shield: Protection and deprotection are key to selective synthesis, but conventional methods can lack sustainability. This review highlights electrochemical and photochemical strategies as greener alternatives, emphasizing their mechanisms, functional group tolerance, and broad synthetic utility.








Abstract
While functional group tolerance is a critical consideration in synthetic method development, many functional groups often fail to remain intact under diverse reaction conditions. Therefore, the protection of specific functional groups and subsequent deprotection are convenient choices for the efficient and selective synthesis of target compounds, for which the strategies have been securely established. Meanwhile, the development of sustainable synthetic methods, particularly electrochemistry and photochemistry, has recently played a significant role in the field of organic synthesis, and these approaches have proven useful in the methods of functional group protection and deprotection. This review explores electrochemical and photochemical strategies for the protection and deprotection of functional groups, with a focus on their mechanistic diversity, sustainability, and synthetic utility across various functional group classes.

         <title>Synthesis of Siphonazole B Through Domino Cycloisomerization&#8208;Oxazolonium Ion Rearrangements</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study by Strand and co&#8208;workers describes a concise synthesis of siphonazole B. Both oxazole units are formed from a simple propargylamine using a novel domino cycloisomerization&#8208;rearrangement approach. Additional synthetic features include a direct aldol&#8208;type reaction for assembling the tricyclic siphonazole core and an oxidative amidation reaction to install the sensitive (E)&#8208;penta&#8208;2,4&#8208;dieneylamide.








Abstract
4&#8208;Alkenyl&#8208; and 4&#8208;acyloxazoles represent important substructures across a diverse array of bioactive molecules. Practical methods to synthesize these motifs are, therefore, of considerable interest. Here, we develop a novel domino process wherein a cycloisomerization is followed by a 1,2&#8208;rearrangement via an oxazolonium ion to yield 4&#8208;alkenyloxazoles from an abundant &#946;&#8208;chloro&#8208;N&#8208;benzyl propargylamine and acyl chlorides. The synthetic utility of the method is highlighted by its application to both oxazole units of siphonazole B, leading to a concise convergent total synthesis of this natural product.

         <title>Synthesis, Photophysical, and Chemiexcitation Properties of Luminol&#8208;Fullerene Dyads: Toward Chemiexcitation Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emission properties of fullerene&#8208;luminol dyads, following either irradiation or chemiexcitation, are evaluated. Strong luminol (chemi)luminescence quenching is partially attributed to electron transfer.








Abstract
Fullerene&#8208;based donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) dyads have been extensively studied for their unique electronic properties, with applications in photoinduced energy conversion devices. In these systems, dynamic quenching of the excited donor's emission occurs, via energy or electron transfer to the fullerene acceptor. However, there are no reports on fullerene dyads bearing chemiluminescent donor analogues. In this context, the synthesis of two luminol&#8208;fullerene D&#8208;A dyads, bridged with alkyl chains of different lengths, is reported herein. The electronic communication between the two moieties was thoroughly evaluated, following either the photo&#8208; or chemi&#8208;excitation of the linked units. Steady state and time&#8208;resolved absorption studies, combined with emission techniques, were employed to monitor the deactivation fate of excited species. In general, a significant quenching of the excited luminol&#8208;derived emission signals was observed, revealing detectable intramolecular interactions between the two moieties. Unlike what is usually observed in other luminol&#8208;based D&#8208;A systems, quenching of the excited species generated upon photo&#8208; and chemi&#8208;excitation of the luminol&#8208;fullerene dyads is attributed to electron rather than energy transfer. This was found to be consistent with the estimated Gibbs energy of photoinduced electron transfer and with DFT theoretical calculations.

         <title>Pd[B(S2O7)2]2 and Pd[B(SO4) (S2O7)]2: Two Borosulfates with Pd2+ in Octahedral and One with Pd2+ in Square Planar Oxygen Coordination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two polymorphs of Pd[B(S2O7)2]2 have been obtained as blue crystals, respectively. The [B(S2O7)2]&#8722; &#8211;anions coordinate the central Pd2+ cations via oxygen atoms in octahedral fashion. With Pd2+ as d8 high&#8208;spin cations the bulk samples are paramagnetic. Furthermore, Pd[B(SO4)(S2O7)] has been obtained as side product in form of red crystals. The structure exhibits chain&#8208;like borosulfate anions and Pd2+ cations in square planar coordination.








Abstract
The reaction of elemental palladium with B2O3 and SO3 at elevated temperature results in the formation of blue crystals of Pd[B(S2O7)2]2. Dependent on the reaction conditions, the compound crystallizes in two different polymorphs obtained as bulk samples. In both structures the Pd2+ cations are coordinated by six oxygen atoms in form of an almost perfect octahedron. All oxygen atoms belong to the borosulfate anions [B(S2O7)2]&#8722; and link via Pd2+ cations to an extended network structure. Within the uncommon octahedral oxygen coordination, the Pd2+ cations reveal a d8 high&#8208;spin configuration, which leads to paramagnetism. Occasionally, red crystals are formed during the reaction next to the major fraction of blue crystals of Pd[B(S2O7)2]2. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structure analysis on the red crystals reveals the sum formula Pd[B(SO4)(S2O7)]2 with Pd2+ in square&#8208;planar coordination.

         <title>Ring Contraction of Cyclooctatetraenes toward Non&#8208;Benzenoid Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons by Au(111)&#8208;Catalysis and Bulk Pyrolysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Au(111)&#8208;catalyzed cyclodehydrogenation of tetraphenylated DA&#8208;COT and TA&#8208;COT is compared with bulk pyrolysis. On Au(111), a strain&#8208;induced contraction of the central COT unit toward six&#8208;membered rings occurs. For TA&#8208;COT, a rearrangement toward a non&#8208;benzenoid polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon containing five&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered rings is observed as an alternative reaction product. Uncatalyzed bulk pyrolysis only gives the ring contraction product for both COT derivatives.








Abstract
The Au(111)&#8208;catalyzed cyclodehydrogenation of tetraphenylated diacenaphtho&#8208;cyclooctatetraene (DA&#8208;COT) and tetraacenaphtho&#8208;cyclooctatetraene (TA&#8208;COT) was investigated and compared with their uncatalyzed bulk pyrolysis. On Au(111), a strain&#8208;induced contraction of the central COT unit toward six&#8208;membered rings upon extrusion of alkynes occurred. For TA&#8208;COT, an alternative reaction pathway opened up due to the increased ring strain of the eliminated alkyne product. This pathway involved a rearrangement toward a non&#8208;benzenoid polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon containing a sesquifulvalene core. Intermediates and (by&#8208;)products were observed by high&#8208;resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy (nc&#8208;AFM), verifying the predicted reaction mechanism. Formation of [8]circulene derivatives was not observed. Uncatalyzed bulk pyrolysis only gave one ring contraction product, respectively, for both COT derivatives.

         <title>What Can be Learned From the Electrostatic Environments Within Nitrogenase Enzymes?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic M&#8208;clusters of nitrogenase enzymes exhibit characteristic electrostatic patterns around the sites involved in N2 fixation. Specifically, a strong local electric field pointing away from the Fe2 site is consistently identified, as well as a minor field pointing toward the Fe6 sites. Furthermore, a significant long&#8208;range field along the Fe2&#8211;Fe6 axis is computed. These patterns may significantly impact the chemical reactivity of these clusters.








Abstract
Nitrogen fixation is a fundamental, and yet challenging, chemical transformation due to the intrinsic inertness of dinitrogen. Whereas industrial ammonia synthesis relies on the energy&#8208;intensive Haber&#8211;Bosch process, nitrogenase enzymes achieve this transformation under ambient conditions&#8212;yet at the expense of a remarkably high ATP demand. Understanding their mode of operation could inspire the development of more efficient synthetic catalysts. In this study, we scrutinize the electrostatic environment surrounding nitrogenase's active site, the so&#8208;called M&#8208;cluster. Strikingly, we observe that all types of M&#8208;clusters exhibit similar trends, with distinct patterns around the individual metal sites that have been proposed as potential N2&#8208;coordination sites. Specifically, a strong local electric field pointing away from the Fe2 site is identified, as well as a minor field pointing toward the Fe6 sites. Furthermore, a significant oriented long&#8208;range field along the Fe2&#8211;Fe6 axis is computed across the entire family of nitrogenases. In the final part of the manuscript, we discuss how the observed electrostatic patterns may impact chemical reactivity, and how they can be connected to previously made mechanistic hypotheses. Overall, this study provides further evidence for the ubiquitousness of local electric fields in enzyme catalysis, even when substrates that seemingly have only limited electrostatic susceptibility are involved.

         <title>Synergistic Enhancement Mechanisms of Lithium&#8208;Ion Storage in Black Phosphorus@Ti3C2Tx (BP@Ti3C2Tx) Composite Thin&#8208;Film Electrodes</title>

         <dc:description>
A binder&#8208;free BP@Ti3C2Tx composite film electrode was prepared by vacuum filtration. Ti3C2Tx MXene forms a 3D conductive network and Ti&#9472;O&#9472;P bonds, inhibits the volume expansion of BP, achieves high capacity (685.92 mAh/g at 0.1 a /g) and excellent stability.








Abstract
A binder&#8208;free BP@Ti3C2Tx composite thin&#8208;film electrode was fabricated via a one&#8208;step vacuum filtration method, enabling precise control over morphology and scalability. The Ti3C2Tx MXene framework constructs a 3D conductive network that enhances charge transfer kinetics and mechanically confines black phosphorus (BP) particles through robust Ti&#9472;O&#9472;P bonding, effectively suppressing BP's volume expansion during cycling. Structural characterization (XRD, SEM, EDS, etc.) confirms the homogeneous &#8220;Mosaic&#8221; architecture, with BP particles uniformly embedded in the MXene matrix. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis further reveals enhanced Ti&#9472;C bonding and significant Ti&#8208;O&#8208;P interfacial interactions. Electrochemical evaluation demonstrates exceptional performance: the composite electrode achieves a discharge capacity of 685.92 mAh/g at 0.1 A/g after 100 cycles, near&#8208;100% Coulombic efficiency, and remarkable capacity recovery (783.21 mAh/g) after high&#8208;rate cycling (1.5 A/g). Kinetic analysis via cyclic voltammetry further indicates a reduced polarization (&#916;V&#160;=&#160;0.06&#160;V) and enhanced capacitive contribution (b&#8208;value&#160;=&#160;0.663&#8211;0.799), attributed to MXene's dual role in facilitating ion diffusion and electron transport. This work provides a scalable, binder&#8208;free electrode design strategy, offering fundamental insights into MXene&#8208;phosphorus synergism for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries.

         <title>A Modular Solid Phase Synthesis Approach for Glycocalix[4]Arene Derivatives and Their Multivalent Presentation on Ultrasmall Gold Nanoparticles.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we present a calix[4]arene building block suitable for modular solid&#8208;phase polymer synthesis and the preparation of functional glycocalix[4]arene. This allows us to incorporate carbohydrate ligands and further functionalities, such as alkynes at a specific position at the upper or lower rim of the calix[4]arene as demonstrated for the conjugation onto Au nanoparticles.








Abstract
Gold nanoparticles and calix[n]arenes are well&#8208;established platforms for creating multivalent carbohydrate ligands that enhance binding avidity and selectivity toward carbohydrate&#8208;recognizing receptors, such as bacterial lectins. In this study, we present a modular synthesis protocol for tailor&#8208;made and (multi)functional glycocalix[4]arene derivatives using solid&#8208;phase polymer synthesis. A calix[4]arene building block with a single carboxyl group on the lower rim and four nitro groups at the upper rim is introduced. This building block is attached to a solid support using standard solid phase peptide coupling conditions, followed by reduction of the upper rim nitro functionalities to yield four amine groups, that are further functionalized through solid&#8208;phase polymer synthesis. Using this modular approach, we access a series of glyco&#8208;calix[4]arene structures that are then further conjugated onto ultrasmall gold nanoparticles. Conjugation is promoted either via one or via four alkyne groups on the glycocalixarene structure, providing a handle to tune the overall valency of the final glyco[4]calixarene&#8208;gold nanoparticle conjugates. Finally, the glycocalix[4]arene derivatives and conjugates are evaluated for their inhibitory potential against bacterial adhesion showing the importance of multivalent carbohydrate presentation to effectively block Escherichia coli (E. coli) adhesion.

         <title>Quasiracemic Crystallization of Luminescent Chiral Molecules: Mechanochromic Luminescence and Sign Inversion of Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of naphthalene&#8208; and benzothiadiazole&#8208;substituted (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;binaphthol derivatives was designed as luminescent quasiracemates. Quasiracemic crystals of these compounds exhibit CPL, which cannot be observed in racemic crystals.








Abstract
The arrangement of molecules plays a crucial role in governing the luminescent properties of organic crystals. While quasiracemic crystallization, based on the co&#8208;crystallization of two structurally similar but nonidentical enantiomeric molecules, offers a promising strategy for organizing distinct species within a single crystal, its potential for tuning luminescent behavior remains largely unexplored.

&lt;p&gt;A pair of naphthalene- and benzothiadiazole-substituted (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)- and (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-binaphthol derivatives was designed as luminescent quasiracemates. Quasiracemic crystals of these compounds exhibit CPL, which cannot be observed in racemic crystals.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arrangement of molecules plays a crucial role in governing the luminescent properties of organic crystals. While quasiracemic crystallization, based on the co-crystallization of two structurally similar but nonidentical enantiomeric molecules, offers a promising strategy for organizing distinct species within a single crystal, its potential for tuning luminescent behavior remains largely unexplored. Herein, we have prepared quasiracemic crystals from a pair of enantiomeric binaphthyl derivatives functionalized with either ethynylnaphthalene or ethynylbenzothiadiazole groups. The molecular arrangement of the quasiracemic crystal is analogous to that of the racemic ethynylnaphthalene derivative, whereas the quasiracemic crystals exhibit mechanochromic luminescence (MCL) behavior similar to that of the racemic ethynylbenzothiadiazole derivative. Notably, the quasiracemic crystals exhibit circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), and the CPL sign is inverted relative to that of the enantiopure crystal of the ethynylbenzothiadiazole derivative. These results highlight quasiracemic crystallization as a new strategy for modulating MCL and CPL properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reassessing the Possibility of &#960;&#8211;&#963;&#8211;&#960; Full Electron Delocalization Through 3D Aromatic Carboranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromatic carborane clusters interact with &#960;&#8208;systems primarily through local negative hyperconjugation. This interaction is highly dependent on the cluster's size and symmetry. Significant through&#8208;cage delocalization occurs mainly in radical species, though similar behavior can also be observed in simple hydrocarbons.








Abstract
Over the past few decades, considerable attention has been devoted to explore the electronic interactions of various substituents with 3D aromatic carboranes. In the case of substituents possessing available p&#8208;orbitals, conjugation between the &#960;&#8208;system and the &#963;&#8208;framework of the carborane is possible via negative hyperconjugation, where electron density from a filled &#960;&#8208;orbital overlaps with an adjacent &#963;* orbital. However, this is inherently a local effect, which was further bolstered by the fact that aromatic conjugation between planar (2D) &#960;&#8208;systems and the 3D aromatic carborane cage does not exist. Nevertheless, recent studies have raised the intriguing possibility that 3D aromatic carboranes may function as &#963;&#8208;conjugated bridges, enabling electronic communication between spatially separated &#960;&#8208;systems. Herein, we investigated the potential conjugation of various substituents with or through carborane systems to better understand the nature of the possible interaction. We demonstrated that significant delocalization through the carborane cluster can be achieved only in the case of radical systems; however, this type of interaction is not a unique feature of carboranes, as similar behavior can also be observed in saturated hydrocarbons.

A new photoactivatable bioorthogonal function was added to the photoactivatable bioorthogonal toolbox by transiently disabling the bioorthogonal reactivity of the hydroxylamine moiety with a photolabile protecting group. The photocaged bioorthogonal function was further equipped with a HaloTag substrate to enable its use in live&#8208;cell labeling schemes.

         <title>Chloride Selective, Nonprotonophoric Ion Transport with Macrocyclic Halogen Bonding Anionophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocyclic halogen bonding anionophores are reported, which enable very high chloride over proton and hydroxide transport selectivity. This ion selectivity profile is key for future potential therapeutic applications, and its origin is explored through DFT and MD simulations at the membrane.








Abstract
Synthetic ion transporters hold promise as both chemical probes and potential therapeutics for diseases linked to malfunctioning protein ion transporters. However, their application in biological systems is limited, partly due to the cytotoxicity arising from unselective ion transport. Here, we demonstrate that highly active and selective anionophores can be accessed by combining halogen bonding anion recognition with macrocyclic anion encapsulation. Anion transport experiments in large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) revealed over 300&#8208;fold selectivity for chloride transport over proton/hydroxide ions, which is key for potential future therapeutic applications, where the dissipation of cellular pH gradients must be avoided. The mechanism underpinning selectivity is studied through Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at the membrane interface, demonstrating that the cyclic structure imposes an energetic preference for chloride binding over hydroxide, as well as a greater desolvation of hydroxide, which further disfavors its transport. We anticipate that these results will accelerate the transition toward the use of artificial chloride transport in biology.

         <title>Influence of Sequence Structure of Donor/Acceptor&#8208;Containing Segment on Crystallization&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Assembly Behavior and Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Activity#</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of sequence structure of donor&#8208;acceptor &#960;&#8208;conjugated segment on CDSA behavior and photophysical/chemical properties is examined by using block copolymers containing block&#8208;like BT&#8208;OPE5&#8208;BT and alternative&#8208;like B&#8208;alt&#8208;BT segments, respectively, as model samples. The results reveal that B&#8208;alt&#8208;BT segments exhibit more pronounced intra/ intermolecular charge transfer than BT&#8208;OPE5&#8208;BT, which leads to much stronger intermolecular interactions for B&#8208;alt&#8208;BT&#8208;b units, higher resistance toward the dissolution for the seed micelles with a B&#8208;alt&#8208;BT core and appealing photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity for B&#8208;alt&#8208;BT&#8208;based fiber&#8208;like micelles.








Abstract
Crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA) has emerged as a facile strategy to generate donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) &#960;&#8208;conjugated nanofibers with potential applications from photocatalysis to nanomedicine. However, the reports on CDSA of D&#8208;A &#960;&#8208;conjugated&#8208;polymer&#8208;based block copolymers (BCPs) are rather rare. In this context, we report two types of BCPs containing the same corona&#8208;forming poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) segment, but different core&#8208;forming D&#8208;A &#960;&#8208;conjugated blocks, one of which (BT&#8208;OPE5&#8208;BT) contains an OPE5 segment flanked by two electron&#8208;deficient benzothiadiazole (BT) unit and another one of which (B&#8208;alt&#8208;BT) contains four phenylene (B) units and three BT units placed in an alternate way. The BT&#8208;OPE5&#8208;BT&#8208;based seed micelles were not kinetically frozen with obvious micellar dissolution at room temperature, whereas almost no micellar dissolution occurred for B&#8208;alt&#8208;BT&#8208;based seed micelles. However, only polydisperse fiber&#8208;like micelles can be formed by self&#8208;seeding approach owing to presence of multiple packing modes for B&#8208;alt&#8208;BT&#8208;b&#8208;PNIPAM36 over the micellar elongation. The B&#8208;alt&#8208;BT exhibited much more pronounced intra/intermolecular charge transfer effect than BT&#8208;OPE5&#8208;BT, and thus the micelles of B&#8208;alt&#8208;BT&#8208;b&#8208;PNIPAM36 exhibited about 50&#160;nm red&#8208;shift in UV/vis absorption band than that of BT&#8208;OPE5&#8208;BT&#8208;b&#8208;PNIPAM36 and appealing photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activities. This work highlights the importance of sequence structure of D/A units of D&#8208;A segments on both CDSA behavior and photophysical/ chemical properties.

         <title>Tailored Watson&#8211;Crick Pairing Partners for Xanthosine in RNA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
RNAs with kappa&#8208;xanthosine (K&#8211;X) or 2&#8208;iminocytidine&#8208;xanthosine (2imC&#8211;X) base pairs form stable double helices that have higher melting temperatures than those of the A&#8211;U or G&#8211;U references. Access to these novel 2imC&#8208;modified RNAs is possible through the mild, selective chemical conversion of 2&#8208;thiocytidine RNA precursors.








Abstract
The deamination of guanosine nucleobases results in the formation of xanthosine (X)&#8208;containing RNA. This process formally resembles adenine deamination (A&#8208;to&#8208;I editing). The biological significance and basic chemical consequences of X&#8208;modified RNA are poorly understood. In this study, we examine xanthosine interactions with tailored pyrimidine nucleobases. We synthesized RNAs that provide either the 2,4&#8208;diaminopyrimidine C&#8208;nucleoside kappa (K) or 2&#8208;iminocytidine (2imC) as an &#8220;ideal&#8221; tridendate Watson&#8211;Crick pairing partner. For K&#8208;modified RNA, we used a phosphoramidite previously introduced for RNA solid&#8208;phase synthesis. For 2imC&#8208;modified RNA, we developed access via synthetic 2&#8208;thiocytidine (2sC)&#8208;modified RNA, followed by osmium tetroxide (OsO&#8324;)&#8208;ammonium chloride (NH&#8324;Cl)&#8208;mediated transformation into 2imC&#8208;modified RNA. RNAs with K&#8211;X or 2imC&#8211;X base pairs indeed showed stable duplex formation with significantly higher melting temperatures than X&#8211;C or X&#8211;U containing RNAs and higher still than A&#8211;U or G&#8211;U containing RNA references. Furthermore, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallographic structure analysis confirmed the tridendate Watson&#8211;Crick pair geometry of K&#8211;X within an RNA double helix. Our findings suggest that K&#8211;X and 2imC&#8211;X pairs could be used in RNA decoding processes, thereby expanding the RNA genetic alphabet. However, their potential for use in biochemical and cellular applications remains to be seen.

         <title>Small Cations for Engineering 3D Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept article provides a critical overview on the role of organic cation in defining the physical properties of 3D hybrid perovskites, explores alternative potential cations suitable for perovskite structure formation, and aims to answer the fundamental question if it is still worth looking for new 3D perovskites.








Abstract
Within the last 15 years, 3D hybrid perovskites made a breakthrough in the development of new semiconducting materials for diverse applications. This concept article addresses several critical questions central to the development and understanding of 3D hybrid perovskites. Specifically, it explores: (1) which organic cations are currently known to stabilize 3D perovskite structures; (2) the potential for discovering and utilizing new cations to support these structures; (3) the influence of the organic cation on physical, chemical, and optoelectronic properties of 3D hybrid perovskites; and (4) whether ongoing research should focus on the synthesis of novel 3D perovskites with alternative small organic cations. By examining these questions, this article aims to provide insights into the structural versatility, property optimization, and future directions for this rapidly evolving field, while also critically evaluating the feasibility and value of expanding the library of organic cations for 3D hybrid perovskite materials.

         <title>Amine&#8208;AlH3 Adducts as Energetic Materials for a New Generation of Solid Fuels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New amine&#8208;AlH&#8323; adducts offer a more environmentally friendly, high&#8208;energy alternative to conventional rocket propellants, and exhibit ultra&#8208;fast ignition. They can be synthesized by mechanochemical method under hydrogen pressure starting from aluminum metal directly or by wet chemical processes with AlH3.








Abstract
Energetic materials, mainly propellants, explosives, and pyrotechnics, are crucial in various civilian applications, such as fuels for rockets and spacecraft. Current energetic fuels rely on highly toxic and polluting ammonium perchlorate (AP) or carcinogenic hydrazine derivatives, encouraging the search for greener and safer substitutes. This work demonstrates the first use of amine&#8208;AlH3 adducts as potential solid fuels with promising hypergolic properties, high energy content, and without toxic derivatives. The herein presented four amine&#8208;AlH3 adducts, AlH3 coordinated with quinuclidine (Quin), triethylenediamine (TEDA), hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA), and tetraazatricyclododecane (TATD), illustrate a unique strategy to create new solid fuels by combining AlH3 with an energy&#8208;rich nitrogen&#8208;containing molecule. The crystal structures of new compounds ([HMTA&#8208;AlH3]n and [TATD&#8208;AlH3]n) are determined from powder X&#8208;ray diffraction data. Differential scanning calorimetry&#8208;thermogravimetric analysis (DSC&#8208;TGA) of the samples combined with mass spectrometry (MS) evidence high thermal stability. The ultrashort ignition delays as low as one&#160;ms show an excellent hypergolic response. Four amine&#8208;AlH3 adducts have higher combustion heat (&gt;&#160;29&#160;kJ&#160;g&#8722;1) than conventional hydrazine fuels (19.5&#160;kJ&#160;g&#8722;1). Finally, the successful mechanochemical syntheses of Quin2AlH3 and [HMTA&#8208;AlH3]n are introduced, showcasing a green chemistry approach to energetic materials.

Bone&#8208;tired? Not for long, calcium. Just step into the light! Calcium compounds, know to engage in hydrophosphination catalysis, experience accelerated reactivity under photocatalytic conditions. Ancillary ligands are a critical factor, shifting the catalysis from radical to closed&#8208;shell. More information can be found in the Research Article by R. Waterman and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202500223). Artwork by Pamela Vargas de los Santos.

         <title>Cover Feature: Pyrazine&#8208;Functionalized Ru(II)&#8208;Complexes as Visible&#8208;Light Activated Photobases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 36, June 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature shows a [Ru(dqpyz)2]2+ complex in an aqueous medium. A metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer process can be induced by optical excitation at 490 nm. This leads to a redistribution of electron density towards the pyrazine moiety of the ligand, with blue and red representing the depletion and accumulation of negative charge, respectively. This process is denoted photobasicity and results in an excited&#8208;state proton transfer reaction with a neighboring water molecule (dotted line). More information can be found in the Research Article by U. S. Schubert, B. Dietzek&#8208;Ivan&#353;i&#263; and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202404033).

A review of HRMs over the last 10 years is presented, including aspects of their supramolecular chemistry, magnetic properties, and applications.








Abstract
The extension of previous studies of heterometallic rings (HMRs) is described, including new synthetic chemistry and physics. These HMRs feature a ring of, typically, eight metal centers with a central charge&#8208;balancing cation. New HMRs and related molecules are described, varying the number of metals present. The eight metal HMRs have been used as components of larger supramolecular assembly, most often by making the HMRs into [2]rotaxanes or pseudo&#8208;rotaxanes, where the thread of the rotaxane is terminated by a binding group such as pyridine. This allows the formation of [n]rotaxanes, where n&#160;=&#160;3, 4, 5,7, 13, or 1014. Mass spectrometry and NMR studies of the HMRs have given greater understanding of the host&#8208;guest chemistry of these metal analogues of crown ethers. Physical studies have included 4D&#8208;inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and continuous wave and pulsed EPR spectroscopy to measure magnetic interactions between spin components of the supramolecular assemblies. The use of the HMRs as resists for high&#8208;resolution lithography is also discussed.

         <title>Photocatalytic Oxidation of Alcohols with Organic Dyes: From Homogeneous Systems to Sensitized Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 36, June 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We discuss the developments in the light&#8208;driven oxidation of alcohols with PC. We report cases where the homogeneous systems can be interfaced with electrochemical tools or adapted in flow and where the PC are integrated in sensitized materials.








Abstract
The oxidation of alcohols retains an enormous importance in industry and in synthetic organic chemistry. The renaissance in photocatalysis is offering new routes to conduct this class of transformations under benign and sustainable conditions. In this concept article, we highlight the efforts that have been conducted in light&#8208;driven oxidation of alcohols using organic photocatalysts (PC). After an overview of relevant industrial processes, we will discuss relevant examples of PC employed in solution or when integrated in photosynthetic schemes within semiconductor slides or nanoparticles. The combination of the photochemical systems with electrochemical routes or their engineering in flow will be considered. Where possible, we highlight also mechanistic aspects that reveal the key steps involved and contribute to improve the performance of the process. We finally present an outlook on the future perspectives and developments in the field.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Precise Synthesis of Non&#8208;Hexagonal Ring&#8208;Embedded Graphene Nanoribbons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 36, June 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced on&#8208;surface synthesis enables fabrication of non&#8208;hexagonal ring&#8208;embedded graphene nanoribbons via four principal strategies: Ullmann coupling followed by cyclodehydrogenation, [2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition, lateral fusion reactions, and skeletal rearrangement.








Abstract
Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), as quasi&#8208;one&#8208;dimensional carbon nanostructures, combine the exceptional properties of graphene with tunable bandgaps. The incorporation of periodic non&#8208;hexagonal ring motifs into GNR frameworks offers an effective approach to significantly tailor their electronic and magnetic properties. However, synthesis of GNRs incorporating non&#8208;hexagonal rings remains challenging, due to the thermodynamic instability compared to their hexagonal counterparts. Advancements in on&#8208;surface synthesis and in&#8208;situ characterization techniques have emerged as powerful methods for the atomically precise fabrication of novel carbon nanostructures. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the recent progress in on&#8208;surface synthesis of non&#8208;hexagonal ring&#8208;embedded GNRs via sophisticated design of precursors and optimized reaction pathways. This review aims to provide insights into strategies for constructing carbon polygons into nanostructures via surface&#8208;mediated chemical reactions, thereby enabling their multifunctional applications in electronics and spintronics.

         <title>Nonconventional Silicon&#8208;Hybrid Luminophores of Hyperbranched Polymer: Fluorescence Regulation and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 36, June 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The excellent luminescent properties of nonconventional polymer materials have attracted broad attention. In this paper, we systematically review the nonconjugated luminescence mechanism and multicolor tunable optical properties of nonconventional polymers&#8208;hyperbranched polysiloxanes (HBPSi) and their derivatives, explore the role of molecular engineering strategies in promoting their luminescent properties and biocompatible functionalization, and look forward to the potential of their applications in bioimaging and other fields. 








Abstract
Hyperbranched polysiloxanes are a class of nonconventional polymers with unique structural features and excellent physicochemical properties, which have attracted great attention in the field of luminescent materials. This review summarizes the recent progress in the study of luminescence mechanisms and optical properties of various hyperbranched polymers containing Si&#9472;O&#9472;C segments with Si as branching points, including hyperbranched polysiloxanes, hyperbranched polyborosiloxanes, and hyperbranched polysilphosphates. Through molecular design and structural regulation, researchers have successfully achieved multicolor fluorescence and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence emission ranging from blue to red in these polymers, with quantum yields reaching up to 54.1% and fluorescence lifetimes up to 9.73 &#181;s. The AIE properties and excellent biocompatibility of these polymers provide new materials and strategies for applications in bioimaging, controlled drug release, information security encryption, and ion detection. Moreover, the opportunities and challenges for further development are briefly discussed.

         <title>Pyrazine&#8208;Functionalized Ru(II)&#8208;Complexes as Visible&#8208;Light Activated Photobases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 36, June 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible light excitation leads to the accumulation of electron density in pyrazine&#8208;containing Ru(II) complexes via metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT). In aqueous solutions of appropriate pH, excited&#8208;state proton transfer (ESPT) takes place on a timescale of hundreds of ps. We resolve the underlying kinetics via transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy and corroborate our studies by photometric titrations and DFT calculations.








Abstract
Excited&#8208;state proton transfer (ESPT) roots in significantly increased acidities or basicities of up to ca. 10 pKa units in the excited state compared to the ground state. While organic photobases are either of &#8220;single use&#8221; in the case of photobase generators or are limited functionally by their UV absorption, metal complex&#8208;based photobases offer intriguing properties. By exciting the characteristic metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transitions in the visible range, multiple and reversible ESPT processes can be triggered. In this contribution we present the synthesis of two novel Ruthenium(II)&#8208;complexes with pyrazine&#8208;functionalized polypyridyl ligands and study their photobasic properties by ultrafast spectroscopy. We find that MLCT excitation in aqueous solution leads to a &#916;pKa of 9 units and that the involved ESPT process takes place within ca. 300 picoseconds. Our investigations combine experimental spectroscopy with theoretical calculations.

&lt;p&gt;Visible light excitation leads to the accumulation of electron density in pyrazine-containing Ru(II) complexes via metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT). In aqueous solutions of appropriate pH, excited-state proton transfer (ESPT) takes place on a timescale of hundreds of ps. We resolve the underlying kinetics via transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy and corroborate our studies by photometric titrations and DFT calculations.

         <title>DFT&#8208;Guided Synthesis, Electrochemical, and Photophysical Properties of Ruthenium(II) Polypyridyl Complexes Featuring Flavin&#8208;Inspired &#960;&#8208;Extended Ligands</title>

The photophysical properties as well as the multielectron storage capacity of a several ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complexes with flavin&#8208;inspired &#960;&#8208;extended ligands are investigated in a joint synthetic&#8208;spectroscopic&#8208;theoretical approach.








Abstract
Light&#8208;driven electron transfer and subsequent multielectron storage is among the key aspects of photochemical reactions in artificial photosynthesis and molecular electronics. Following our previously introduced design and characterization of Ru(II)&#8208;based photosensitizers, four new Ru complexes with &#960;&#8208;extended ligands featuring a flavin&#8208;inspired subunit were investigated via density functional theory in order to evaluate their electrochemical properties ahead of a time and resource&#8208;demanding synthesis. Two complexes, Ru&#8208;Me2alloxB and Ru&#8208;Me2deazaalloxB, with a bent ligand architecture, were identified as promising candidates for application in light&#8208;driven charge accumulation and subsequently synthesized. The electrochemical characterization of Ru&#8208;Me2alloxB confirmed the theoretical predictions and its photophysical properties were investigated using UV/Vis absorption, resonance Raman, time&#8208;resolved emission, and time&#8208;resolved absorption spectroscopy in combination with quantum chemical simulations. Furthermore, first insights into the electronic distribution in the singly reduced complex were modelled computationally and obtained by EPR and UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy and spectroelectrochemistry. These results underline the promising multielectron storage capacity of the newly designed &#960;&#8208;extended alloxazine ligand.

         <title>Chloride Double Perovskites Doped With Sb3+/Er3+ as Stable and Effective Luminescence Material in the Vis&#8208;NIR Region</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 36, June 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The luminescence properties of Sb3+/Er3+&#8208;doped chloride double perovskites Cs2Ag0.4Na0.6InCl6 have been investigated across 250&#8208;1600&#160;nm. Structural and spectroscopic analyses have been performed using XRD, SEM, Raman, XPS, and ToF&#8208;SIMS methods. Energy transfer from Sb3+ to Er3+ enables emission at 525, 552, 665, 805 and&#160;1540&#160;nm. The LED prototype has been &#8208; developed, demonstrating potential for optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
The luminescence properties of stable chloride double perovskites Cs2BIInCl6, where BI is 4 at.% Ag, 6 at.% Na, doped with Sb3+ and Er3+ &#160;were investigated for the first time in the 250&#8208;1600 nm region and revealed significant potential for advanced application. We employed XPS and ToF&#8208;SIMS for chemical analyses, while SEM, XRD, and Raman spectroscopy provided insights into the morphology, crystal structure, and vibrational characteristics of the samples. The crystal structures of Cs2Ag0.292Na0.708InCl6, Cs2Ag0.285Na0.715In0.971Er0.029Cl6, Cs2Ag0.16Na0.84In0.893Er0.017Sb0.09Cl6 were examined using single&#8208;crystal methods. The excited Sb3&#8314; ions emitted blue light at 450&#160;nm due to electronic absorption at sub&#8208;band gap levels, facilitating energy transfer to Er3&#8314; ions. Notably, the Er3&#8314; emitted radiation at 1540&#160;nm, a wavelength particularly useful for optical communication applications. Additionally, emissions at 525&#160;nm, 552&#160;nm, 665&#160;nm, and 805&#160;nm were observed, corresponding to f&#8208;f transitions of Er3&#8314; ions. These compelling results were supported with calculations based on the Modified Crystal Field Theory, explaining the effects of varying concentrations of Sb3&#8314; and Er3&#8314; on the crystal structure and luminescent properties. By using the synthesized materials, we successfully developed an LED prototype that utilized a UV chip (320&#160;nm) combined with the Cs2Ag0.4Na0.6In0.9Er0.01Sb0.09Cl6 powder as a stable and effective luminophore for possible application in optoelectronics.

         <title>Photocatalytic Hydrophosphination Using Calcium Precatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 36, June 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcium compounds are competent photocatalysts for hydrophosphination. Returning to the compounds reported by Barrett and Hill, visible light irradiation at ambient temperature activates simple calcium derivatives comparable to thermal catalysis. Ancillary ligands are key to radical versus nonradical reactivity under these conditions.








Abstract
Hydrophosphination using calcium compounds as catalysts under irradiation is described as a foray into s&#8208;block photocatalysis. Transition&#8208;metal compounds have been highly successful hydrophosphination catalysts under photochemical conditions, utilizing substrates previously considered inaccessible. A calcium hydrophosphination precatalyst, Ca(nacnac) (THF) (N(SiMe3)2) (1, nacnac&#160;=&#160;HC[(C(Me)N&#8208;2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3)]2), reported by Barrett and Hill, as well as the presumed intermediate, Ca(nacnac) (THF) (PPh2) (2), and the Schlenk equilibrium product, Ca[N(SiMe3)2]2(THF)2 (3) were screened under photochemical conditions with a range of unsaturated substrates including styrenic alkenes, Michael acceptors, and dienes with modest to excellent conversions, though unactivated alkenes were inaccessible. All compounds exhibit enhanced catalysis under irradiation by light emitting diode (LED)&#8208;generated blue light. Nacnac&#8208;supported compounds generate radicals as evidenced by Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and radical trapping reactions, whereas unsupported calcium compounds are EPR silent and appear to undergo hydrophosphination akin to thermal reactions with these compounds. These results buttress the notion that photoactivation of &#960;&#8208;basic ligands is a broad phenomenon, extending beyond the d&#8208;block, but like d&#8208;block metals, consideration of ancillary ligands is essential to avoid radical reactivity.

This study presents a strategy to synergistically enhance iodine capture by flexible cyclictriphosphonitrile&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks(COFs) (CTP&#8208;X&#8208;COF, X&#160;= PDA, ODA, BPY, DPT). The adsorption capacities of CTP&#8208;PDA&#8208;COF, CTP&#8208;ODA&#8208;COF, CTP&#8208;BPY&#8208;COF, and CTP&#8208;DPT&#8208;COF for iodine vapor are 4.65&#160;g&#160;g&#8722;1, 4.18 g g&#8722;1, 2.38 g g&#8722;1, and 3.57 g g&#8722;1, respectively.








Abstract
The development of highly efficient materials for trapping radioactive iodine is essential for the safe use of nuclear energy. Herein, we present a strategy to synergistically enhance iodine capture by exploiting the flexible building blocks with the affinity properties of electrically rich heteroatoms by combining the cyclic triphosphonitrile derivative with amine linkers of different molecular lengths and constructing triangular pore&#8208;structured flexible cyclotriphosphonitrile&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks. A series of cyclotriphosphonitrile&#8208;based COFs (CTP&#8208;X&#8208;COF, X&#160;= PDA, ODA, BPY, DPT) with triangular pore topology were synthesized using CTP&#8208;6 as the node and connection point of p&#8208;phenylenediamine (PDA), 4,4&#8208;diaminodiphenyl ether (ODA), 5,5&#8208;diamino2,2&#8208;bipyridine (BPY), and 4,4&#8208;diaminotribiphenyl (DPT) with different molecular lengths. It was found that the adsorption capacities of CTP&#8208;PDA&#8208;COF, CTP&#8208;ODA&#8208;COF, CTP&#8208;BPY&#8208;COF, and CTP&#8208;DPT&#8208;COF for iodine vapor were 4.65&#160;g g&#8722;1, 4.18&#160;g g&#8722;1, 2.38&#160;g g&#8722;1, and 3.57&#160;g g&#8722;1, respectively. The results showed that the adsorption capacities of CTP&#8208;PDA&#8208;COF, CTP&#8208;ODA&#8208;COF, CTP&#8208;BPY&#8208;COF, and CTP&#8208;DPT&#8208;COF for iodine in cyclohexane were 281.50&#160;mg g&#8722;1, 221.67&#160;mg g&#8722;1, 161.14&#160;mg g&#8722;1, and 222.67&#160;mg g&#8722;1, respectively. It was found that the four COFs adsorbed iodine in cyclohexane solution was a mixed adsorption process with chemical adsorption playing a predominant role and physical adsorption as an auxiliary mechanism.

         <title>Porous Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Nb2C Nanosheets for Electrocatalytic ORR to Selectively Produce H2O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 36, June 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous N&#8208;doped Nb2C nanosheets (N&#8208;Nb2C) obtained via a room&#8208;temperature ammonia etching method are presented here. The doping of N via ammonia etching results in pore structures and also effectively modulates the electronic structure, therefore leading to a larger specific surface area and more active sites of N&#8208;Nb2C. Significant improvements in two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction catalytic performance have been achieved, resulting in a H2O2 yield of 86.8%.








Abstract
The two&#8208;electron pathway in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) represents an efficient and environmentally friendly approach for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. Among various types of potential catalysts, MXene have garnered significant attention due to their outstanding electrical conductivity, abundant edge active sites, and low costs. In this study, we successfully synthesize porous N&#8208;doped Nb2C nanosheets (N&#8208;Nb2C) via a room&#8208;temperature ammonia etching method and investigate their ORR performance toward the formation of H2O2. The doping of nitrogen effectively modulates the electronic structure of Nb2C nanosheets, while the abundant surface pores formed during ammonia etching facilitate the ORR process. Hence, the electrocatalytic performance of N&#8208;Nb2C nanosheets is significantly improved, demonstrating excellent long&#8208;term stability and durability. Notably, in rotating ring&#8208;disk electrode (RRDE) tests, the N&#8208;Nb2C catalyst achieves a remarkable H2O2 yield of 86.8%, highlighting its potential for selective H2O2 production through electrocatalytic ORR. Our findings suggest that N&#8208;doped Nb2C holds great promise for applications in two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction for H2O2 synthesis.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Vibration and Liquefaction of Flexible and Naturally Bent Single Crystals</title>

Single crystals obtained by cocrystallization of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;azopyridine and long&#8208;chain fatty acids exhibit versatile stimuli&#8208;responsive properties: UV&#8208;induced rapid vibration, temporary photoliquefaction, and mechanical deformation. These remarkable photo&#8208;responsive properties arise from photoisomerization and photothermal effects, whereas flexible molecular packing enabled by long alkyl chains imparts deformability.








Abstract
Single crystals obtained by cocrystallization of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;azopyridine with long&#8208;chain fatty acids, viz. lauric acid, myristic acid, and palmitic acid, exhibit a variety of light&#8208;responsive properties. The molecular arrangement of the cocrystal components in the crystal structure, coupled with the flexibility of the long alkyl chains and the presence of the azo group, enables the elastic and plastically deformable crystals to demonstrate light responsiveness, which manifests as bending, vibration, and liquefaction. The photoresponses arise from two primary mechanisms: the photoisomerization of azopyridine groups within the crystal lattice and the photothermal effect that generates localized heat under UV light. Consequently, the single crystals display reversible bending and vibrational motion in response to on/off light cycles, as well as temporary liquefaction of the crystalline materials when exposed to higher&#8208;intensity UV light. The arrangement of the long alkyl chains and the presence of weak interactions within the crystal structure impart deformability to the single crystals while lowering melting points. This work illustrates how adaptive crystalline materials can be developed by modulating the crystal structure of light&#8208;sensitive molecular components through non&#8208;covalent synthesis.

         <title>A Linear {FeIII2NiII} Cluster, a Structurally Closely Related Quasi 1D {FeIII2NiII} Chain</title>

         <dc:description>
The synthesis, characterization, and magnetic properties of two closely related heterometallic {FeIII2NiII} species are reported, upon employment of suitable amino acid Schiff&#8208;base ligands; a discrete {FeIII2NiII} trimetallic cluster and a {FeIII2Ni&#921;&#921;}n chain. Despite their striking structural similarity, they display contrasting magnetic properties, with the former showing ferromagnetic and the latter antiferromagnetic behavior.








Abstract
The solvothermal reaction between FeCl3&#183;6H2O, NiCl2&#183;6H2O, 2&#8208;hydroxynaphthaldehyde, and glycine (gly) in MeOH results in the formation of the trinuclear heterometallic cluster [Fe&#921;&#921;&#921;2Ni&#921;&#921;(L1)4(MeOH)4] (1) in good yield, while the same reaction upon replacing gly with methyl&#8208;alanine (mAla), results in the formation of the closely related quasi 1D coordination polymer {[Fe&#921;&#921;&#921;2Ni&#921;&#921;(L2)4(MeOH)2]n} (2) (L1, L2: the dianionic form of the Schiff&#8208;base ligand derived from the condensation of 2&#8208;hydroxynaphthaldehyde and gly (L1 for 1), or mAla (L2 for 2)). The structure of 1 describes a linear trimetallic {FeIII2Ni} unit, whereas complex 2 consists of repeating linear {FeIII2Ni} units with each one connected to two neighboring units via four coordination bonds, forming a quasi&#8208;1D chain. The structural similarity between complex 1 and the repeating unit of complex 2 is remarkable. However, their magnetic properties differ significantly, with complex 1 displaying dominant ferromagnetic interactions, and complex 2 showing antiferromagnetic interactions.

&lt;p&gt;The solvothermal reaction between FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;6H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, NiCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;6H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, 2-hydroxynaphthaldehyde, and glycine (gly) in MeOH results in the formation of the trinuclear heterometallic cluster [Fe&lt;sup&gt;&#921;&#921;&#921;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sup&gt;&#921;&#921;&lt;/sup&gt;(L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(MeOH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) in good yield, while the same reaction upon replacing gly with methyl-alanine (mAla), results in the formation of the closely related quasi 1D coordination polymer {[Fe&lt;sup&gt;&#921;&#921;&#921;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sup&gt;&#921;&#921;&lt;/sup&gt;(L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(MeOH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;} (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) (L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: the dianionic form of the Schiff-base ligand derived from the condensation of 2-hydroxynaphthaldehyde and gly (L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; for &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), or mAla (L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;)). The structure of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; describes a linear trimetallic {Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ni} unit, whereas complex &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; consists of repeating linear {Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ni} units with each one connected to two neighboring units via four coordination bonds, forming a &lt;i&gt;quasi&lt;/i&gt;-1D chain. The structural similarity between complex &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and the repeating unit of complex &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; is remarkable. However, their magnetic properties differ significantly, with complex &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; displaying dominant ferromagnetic interactions, and complex &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; showing antiferromagnetic interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Revealing the Origin of Emission Quenching on Trivalent Europium &#946;&#8208;Diketonate Complex Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 36, June 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We uncover the key quenching mechanism in Eu(III) &#946;&#8208;diketonate complex NPs: coordinated water molecules enhance interactions with external water, accelerating nonradiative deactivation. While aggregation&#8208;induced quenching is minimal, Eu(III) complexes without phenyl groups show enhanced concentration quenching. triphenylphosphine oxide (TPPO) ligation significantly stabilizes luminescence, highlighting ligand design as crucial for optimizing emission in aqueous environments.








Abstract
Eu(III) complex nanoparticles (NPs) prepared via reprecipitation exhibit characteristic emission in aqueous solutions without amphiphilic substituents, making them promising for bioimaging applications. However, although it is well established that water efficiently quenches emissions of Eu(III) complexes, reported emission quantum yields of water&#8208;soluble Eu(III) complex NPs vary significantly among studies, and the factors governing these emission properties have yet to be fully elucidated. In this study, we systematically investigated the emission quenching mechanisms of Eu(III) &#946;&#8208;diketonate complex NPs by time&#8208;resolved absorption and emission spectroscopies. We found that the primary pathway is the interaction between coordinated and external water molecules, which strongly enhances nonradiative deactivation. Notably, coordinated water facilitates stronger interactions with the surrounding water, further promoting quenching. Additionally, we also found that aggregation causes emission quenching in Eu(III) complexes lacking phenyl groups in the &#946;&#8208;diketonate moiety, which have smaller molecular volumes. These findings clarify the origin of luminescence variability in Eu(III) complex&#160;NPs and provide a foundation for rational material design to enhance luminescence stability in aqueous environments.

         <title>Polypyrrole as a Photothermal Reactor to Conduct Solvent&#8208;Free Pericyclic Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 36, June 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polypyrrole photothermal materials can serve as reactors for conducting solvent&#8208;free pericyclic reactions (such as Diels&#8208;Alder reactions, 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions, and electrocyclizations) with yields of up to 90% under irradiation by halogen lamp. The photothermal reactor is recyclable, scalable, and energy&#8208;efficient, offering a green and sustainable strategy for organic synthesis.








Abstract
Solvent&#8208;free organic reactions have proven to be a sustainable strategy in organic synthesis, such as&#160;mechanochemical, microwave&#8208;assisted, and ultrasound&#8208;irradiated methods. As a complementary strategy, photothermal materials may also be used in solvent&#8208;free chemistry. Polypyrroles, the black conjugated polymers, feature facile synthesis, high stability, and excellent light&#8208;harvesting capability, enabling them to serve as photothermal reactors to conduct solvent&#8208;free thermal&#8208;induced reactions. Here, a series of polypyrroles have been synthesized in the presence of various surfactants. The usage of dodecyl dimethyl betaine afforded PPy&#8208;BS, which achieved the highest photothermal performance (241&#176;C under 100&#160;W halogen&#8208;lamp irradiation). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Dynamic light scattering (DLS), and Brunauer&#8208;Emmett&#8208;Teller (BET) analyses suggest that the excellent photothermal performance of PPy&#8208;BS is likely attributed to the well&#8208;organized assembly based on the uniform particle. On this basis, PPy&#8208;BS was employed as a photothermal reactor for Diels&#8208;Alder, dipolar cycloaddition, and electrocyclization reactions under solvent&#8208;free conditions. All trials afforded good to excellent yields up to 90%. Notably, PPy&#8208;BS photothermal reactor exhibits excellent recyclability, a high loading amount of substrates, and upscaling to 1000&#160;mg per batch. In brief, this study highlights the advantages of PPy&#8208;BS photothermal reactors for pericyclic reactions, offering a recyclable, up&#8208;scalable, and solvent&#8208;free platform for sustainable organic synthesis.

A ZnS&#8208;decorated reduced graphene oxide (rGO@ZnS) composite has been developed as a multifunctional host for the sulfur cathode in rechargeable Li&#8211;S batteries. The host exhibits excellent polysulfides adsorption and catalytic conversion during the battery cycling. The experimental results are verified with molecular dynamics simulations, revealing the role of ZnS in accelerating polysulfide conversion kinetics.








Abstract
We present a high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery cathode based on a reduced graphene oxide (rGO)&#8208;decorated ZnS nanosphere structure, which serves as a multifunctional sulfur host. The rGO framework provides a high&#8208;surface&#8208;area conductive network for enhanced sulfur loading, while ZnS acts as an electrocatalyst to accelerate polysulfide conversion. Fabricated via a one&#8208;step hydrothermal method, the composite achieves a high sulfur content (&#8764;80%) with efficient polysulfide confinement and catalytic conversion as an Li&#8211;S battery cathode. As a result, it delivers an initial capacity of 1014 mAh/g at 0.1 C and retains 592 mAh/g at 1C, demonstrating excellent rate capability and cycling stability (479 mAh/g over 200 cycles at 1C). To further understand the interfacial interactions, molecular dynamics simulations were conducted, revealing the role of ZnS in accelerating lithium polysulfide (LiPS) conversion, particularly from Li&#8322;S&#8324; to Li&#8322;S. The study analyzed LiPS diffusion coefficients and potential energy across different sulfur species, confirming the superior efficiency of the rGO@ZnS host. These findings highlight the potential of ZnS&#8208;decorated rGO structures as a promising approach to improving Li&#8211;S battery performance through enhanced sulfur utilization and polysulfide regulation.

         <title>Vinylene&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks with Ammonium&#8208;Promoted&#8208;Proton Transfer for Photocatalysis of H2O2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 36, June 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two vinylene&#8208;linked COFs modified with methoxyl groups were successfully synthesized, which feature promising semiconducting activities and hydrophilicity. Upon treated with ammonium ions, the resultant COFs composites exhibited visible&#8208;light photocatalysis of H2O2 production with more than eight times higher in compared with neat COF samples.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as effective photocatalysts for the environmentally friendly synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) under solar sunlight. Besides electron transfer in an ORR process, proton transport also serves as an important role in promoting kinetic rate, which was majorly improved via modifying the chemical structures of COFs, but seldom to be explored through a simple additive composition. In work, we report the preparation of two new vinylene&#8208;linked COFs termed g&#8208;TDM&#8208;COF and g&#8208;TBD&#8208;COF, respectively, by Knoevenagel condensation of trimethylpyridine (TMP) and 2,5&#8208;Dimethoxyterephthalaldehyde (DMTP) or 3,3&#8242;&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;[1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarbaldehyde (DMBD). They were crystalized in a hexagonal lattice and adopting AA stacking modes. Their porous structures with high surface areas and micro&#8208;/nano&#8208;channels were revealed. The methoxyl substituents pended on and pyridine atoms embedded in the backbones of these COFs rendered them with hydrogen bond donating capabilities. Combined with their substantial semiconducting properties, the COFs enable photocatalysis of hydroperoxide (H2O2) production. Simply compositing these COFs with ammonium ions markedly improved the photoelectric properties, leading to an over eightfold enhancement of photocatalytic H2O2 production relative to the neat COFs, and an increase in apparent quantum yields (AQYs) from 0.70% to 4.22% at 500&#160;nm. Such a phenomenon could be attributed to the efficient interaction of ammonium ions with the COFs via hydrogen&#8208;bond interaction, thus favorable for broadening light&#8208;harvesting, narrowing band gaps, and strengthening proton conductivity. As a consequence, their photocatalytic performance could be distinctly enhanced.

&lt;p&gt;Two vinylene-linked COFs modified with methoxyl groups were successfully synthesized, which feature promising semiconducting activities and hydrophilicity. Upon treated with ammonium ions, the resultant COFs composites exhibited visible-light photocatalysis of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production with more than eight times higher in compared with neat COF samples.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as effective photocatalysts for the environmentally friendly synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) through the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) under solar sunlight. Besides electron transfer in an ORR process, proton transport also serves as an important role in promoting kinetic rate, which was majorly improved via modifying the chemical structures of COFs, but seldom to be explored through a simple additive composition. In work, we report the preparation of two new vinylene-linked COFs termed g-TDM-COF and g-TBD-COF, respectively, by Knoevenagel condensation of trimethylpyridine (TMP) and 2,5-Dimethoxyterephthalaldehyde (DMTP) or 3,3&#8242;-dimethoxy-[1,1&#8242;-biphenyl]-4,4&#8242;-dicarbaldehyde (DMBD). They were crystalized in a hexagonal lattice and adopting AA stacking modes. Their porous structures with high surface areas and micro-/nano-channels were revealed. The methoxyl substituents pended on and pyridine atoms embedded in the backbones of these COFs rendered them with hydrogen bond donating capabilities. Combined with their substantial semiconducting properties, the COFs enable photocatalysis of hydroperoxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) production. Simply compositing these COFs with ammonium ions markedly improved the photoelectric properties, leading to an over eightfold enhancement of photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production relative to the neat COFs, and an increase in apparent quantum yields (AQYs) from 0.70% to 4.22% at 500&#160;nm. Such a phenomenon could be attributed to the efficient interaction of ammonium ions with the COFs via hydrogen-bond interaction, thus favorable for broadening light-harvesting, narrowing band gaps, and strengthening proton conductivity. As a consequence, their photocatalytic performance could be distinctly enhanced.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Ketol&#8208;Acid Reductoisomerase Inhibitor That Has Antituberculosis and Herbicidal Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 36, June 26, 2025. </description>

1a and 1f are potent inhibitors of ketolacid reductoisomerase (KARI). 1f has good antituberculosis activity and 1a has herbicidal activity against Brassica campestris and Amaranthus retroflexus.








Abstract
Ketol&#8208;acid reductoisomerase (KARI) is a target for the development of new biocidal agents. This is based on its essential role in branched chain amino acid biosynthesis in plants and microorganisms, and its absence in animals. The lack of success in developing KARI inhibitors as biocides may be because the inhibitors assessed to date compete directly with the substrate, 2&#8208;acetolactate (AL). As a result, effectiveness diminishes when AL accumulates in cells. Furthermore, as these inhibitors are slow binding, an organism could avoid growth slowdown by increasing KARI production. Here, we show a pyrimidinedione, 1f is a competitive but time&#8208;dependent inhibitor of AL and NADPH for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mt) KARI (Ki = 23.3&#160;nM). A crystal structure of this compound bound to the MtKARI homolog from Staphylococcus aureus (Sa), SaKARI, illustrates this dual competition. In contrast, for Oryza sativa KARI, no time&#8208;dependent inhibition by 1f is observed, though it inhibits AL competitively (146&#160;nM) and NADPH uncompetitively. Despite differences in inhibition properties, 1f has an MIC of 12.7&#160;&#181;m for MtH37Rv and inhibits Brassica campestris growth by 63% at 10&#160;mg mL&#8722;1. Therefore, KARI inhibitors that are competitive for NADPH and show no time&#8208;dependent inhibition have excellent potential as biocides.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Induced Sulfonamidation of [1.1.1]Propellane Promoted by Energy Transfer Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 36, June 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present an EnT&#8208;promoted photocatalytic strategy for the efficient synthesis of diverse C3&#8208;substituted bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanesulfonamides. This method enables the sulfonamidation of [1.1.1]propellane using readily available substrates under mild conditions, providing a sustainable and efficient route to BCP sulfonamides and facilitating their application as valuable building blocks in drug discovery.








Abstract
Sulfonamides represent an important structural motif present in numerous drugs, however, the scarcity of synthetic methods for bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanesulfonamides has limited the applicability of this compound class. Herein, we report an energy transfer (EnT) promoted photocatalytic strategy for the synthesis of bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanesulfonamides via sulfonamidation of [1.1.1]propellane. This approach utilizes N&#8208;nitrososulfonamides as precursors, facilitating the generation of sulfonamide radicals through homolytic cleavage under EnT promotion. These radicals were then found to engage in an addition reaction with [1.1.1]propellane, generating bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) radicals that undergo subsequent C&#9472;H, C&#9472;X, C&#9472;S, or C&#9472;C coupling reactions to afford a variety of C3&#8208;substituted bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanesulfonamides. This strategy featured mild conditions, operational simplicity, with high atomic utilization, and therefore not only offers an efficient synthesis of a range of C3&#8208;versatile&#8208;substituted BCP sulfonamides, but also significantly broadens the potential applicability of BCP&#8208;sulfonamides in drug discovery.

         <title>Solvent Effect on the Chiral Arrangement for Two Achiral Metal&#8208;Organic Colloids in the Vortex Field: Rheological Study and Retention Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 36, June 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two achiral metal&#8208;organic colloids with similar chemical components but different solvents exhibit distinct vortex&#8208;responsive chiroptical properties. Rheological studies reveal that the strong solvent&#8208;colloidal particle interactions are the underlying reason why the colloid can generate dynamic chiral arrangement and exhibit chiroptical properties.








Abstract
The vortex features a helical structure and exhibits macroscopic chirality. Over the past few decades, scientists have observed that several achiral compounds display chiroptical activity within the vortex field. The researchers believe that chiral arrangement may have occurred in this process. Herein, we investigate two achiral metal&#8208;organic colloids (Zn3L/DMSO and Zn3L/DMF) which have similar chemical components but exhibit distinct vortex&#8208;responsive chiroptical properties. In the vortex field, the Zn3L/DMSO colloid presents chiroptical activity, whereas the Zn3L/DMF colloid remains chiroptically silent. Rheological studies reveal the possible underlying reasons. The strong solvent&#8208;colloidal particles interactions in the Zn3L/DMSO colloid endow the system with excellent viscoelasticity and reversible thixotropy. These characteristics enable the Zn3L/DMSO colloid to form a reversible chiral arrangement within the vortex. In contrast, the Zn3L/DMF colloid fails to respond to the vortex. Furthermore, the addition of the charged molecule D enhanced the rheological properties of the Zn3L/DMSO colloid, with the potential to preserve its chiroptical activity. Overall, this research is expected to provide new insights into the vortex&#8208;induced chirality of supramolecular colloids, contributing to a deeper understanding of the underlying principles of chiroptical property in such systems.

         <title>Ultrasmall Gold Nanoparticles (2&#160;nm) Decorated with a High Density of Photochemically Switchable Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 36, June 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoswitchable azo ligands can be conjugated to the surface of ultrasmall gold nanoparticles with a high density (about 50 ligands on each nanoparticle). Their photoswitching is not constrained by the binding to the gold surface and can be used to induce a nematic&#8208;to&#8208;isotropic phase transition in a liquid crystal.








Abstract
Ultrasmall gold nanoparticles (2&#160;nm) were surface&#8208;coated with photoswitchable 3&#8208;azopyridine ligands by ligand exchange with n&#8208;dodecanethiol&#8208;stabilized gold nanoparticles. Each gold nanoparticle carried about 66 dodecanethiol (DDT) ligands and 49 azo ligands. The azo ligands were reversibly switchable between the stable E&#8208; and the metastable Z&#8208;isomer by UV and green light irradiation as shown by UV&#8208;Vis and NMR spectroscopy. The photoswitching was not significantly affected by the conjugation of the azo ligand to the nanoparticle surface, despite the high density of ligands on the particle surface. This offers a pathway for photoswitchable systems on the nanoscale, for example, to manipulate supramolecular systems. The introduction of 0.5 wt% of the nanoparticles into a liquid crystalline host yielded a photoresponsive material which showed a reversible nematic&#8208;to&#8208;isotropic phase transition upon irradiation

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultrasmall gold nanoparticles (2&#160;nm) were surface-coated with photoswitchable 3-azopyridine ligands by ligand exchange with n-dodecanethiol-stabilized gold nanoparticles. Each gold nanoparticle carried about 66 dodecanethiol (DDT) ligands and 49 azo ligands. The azo ligands were reversibly switchable between the stable &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;- and the metastable &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-isomer by UV and green light irradiation as shown by UV-Vis and NMR spectroscopy. The photoswitching was not significantly affected by the conjugation of the azo ligand to the nanoparticle surface, despite the high density of ligands on the particle surface. This offers a pathway for photoswitchable systems on the nanoscale, for example, to manipulate supramolecular systems. The introduction of 0.5 wt% of the nanoparticles into a liquid crystalline host yielded a photoresponsive material which showed a reversible nematic-to-isotropic phase transition upon irradiation&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aryl Shift Rearrangement in Scholl&#8208;Type Reaction Toward Nanographene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 36, June 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Scholl&#8208;type reaction involving both 1,4&#8208;aryl&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;aryl shift rearrangements was discovered, converting a Z&#8208;shaped precursor into nanographene. We establish the principle of the rearrangement mechanism through thermodynamic and kinetic studies using DFT. Our findings indicate that the selection of arenium cation&#8208; or radical cation mechanisms depends on the sizes and positions of the shifting aryl groups.








Abstract
Oxidative dehydrogenation, known as Scholl reaction, is a powerful method for synthesizing many polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Sometimes, unexpected rearrangements can lead to the formation of new structures that are usually difficult to obtain. Here, we discover a novel Scholl&#8208;type reaction involving both 1,4&#8208;aryl&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;aryl shift rearrangements, resulting in the production of armchair nanographene. Additionally, we establish the principle of the rearrangement mechanism through thermodynamic and kinetic studies using density functional theory (DFT). Theoretical studies indicate that the rearrangement reaction involves both arenium cation&#8208; and radical cation mechanisms. The selection of arenium cation&#8208; or radical cation mechanisms depends on the sizes and positions of the shifting aryl groups. Large biphenyl or triphenylenyl groups undergo the arenium cation mechanism, while a small monophenyl group favors the radical cation mechanism. Our findings offer new insights into the controllable rearrangements in Scholl reaction and provide new synthetic methods for obtaining a variety of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are typically challenging to design.

First report on 7&#8208;membered cyclic nucleotides, 2',3'&#8208;cNTDPs, obtained from all&#8208;natural free ribonucleosides in robust, step&#8208;economic synthesis involving instantaneous and regio&#8208;selective reaction. DFT calculations confirmed the feasibility of 7&#8208;membered cyclic nucleotide formation and deciphered the basis for regioselectivity. 2',3'&#8208;cNTDPs were characterized by their solution conformation, hydrolytic stability, and acidity.








Abstract
7&#8208;membered cyclic nucleotides have remained unknown despite the natural abundance of their 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered counterparts. Here, we report the first synthesis of 2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;cyclic nucleosides (tetrathio)diphosphonate (2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;cNTDPs) by a rapid one&#8208;step, regioselective, and protection&#8208;free reaction of U, A, C, I, and G, with methylene&#8208;bis(1,3,2&#8208;dithia&#8208;phospholane&#8208;2&#8208;sulfide) (DTPS). The reaction proceeds instantaneously, even at &#8208;35 &#176;C, resulting in the quantitative conversion of methylene&#8208;bis&#8208;DTPS. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of &#8710;Gr confirm the synthetic feasibility and regioselectivity, attributing the efficiency to strain release in DTPS rings and entropic gain from thiirane elimination. The resulting 2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;cNTDPs exhibited remarkable hydrolytic stability and greater solution structural rigidity than free nucleosides.

         <title>Novel Helical Metallocryptand for Size&#8208;Selective Recognition of Amino Acid Derivatives with Aliphatic Side Chains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 36, June 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel tris(salen)&#8208;type metallocryptand, LNi3, was synthesized, which was found to exist as a pair of P/M helical enantiomers. This LNi3 selectively recognized various amino acid derivatives via non&#8208;covalent interactions, showing a selectivity to those bearing an aliphatic side chain. The LNi3 metallocryptand also exhibited unique P/M helix inversion preferences depending on the guest side chains, offering potential applications in biochemical sensing and enantioselective detection.








Abstract
The novel tris(salen)&#8208;type metallocryptand, LNi3, was designed and synthesized. Its crystallographic analysis revealed the presence as a helical enantiomeric pair, right&#8208;handed (P) and left&#8208;handed (M) forms, rather than the meso form, which was energetically supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This LNi3 host was capable of recognizing amino acid derivatives by several non&#8208;covalent interactions, showing a selectivity to those bearing an aliphatic side chain. Its shape&#8208;persistent nature of the cryptand facilitated the size&#8208;based discrimination, which was clearly demonstrated by 1H NMR spectroscopic titration studies. Recognition of some of the guests caused the emergence of CD signals, indicating the biased P/M helix inversion equilibrium of LNi3. Three aliphatic side&#8208;chain guests, Val, Ile, and Leu, caused an M&#8208;favored shifting, while two &#960;&#8208;containing side&#8208;chain guests, Arg and Trp, showed a preference to the P form. This metallocryptand, LNi3, overcomes the limitation in recognition of less polar amino acids having an alkyl side chain and provides future applications in molecular recognition, biochemical sensing, and enantiomeric sensing.

         <title>Reversible Photocyclization of Imidazoleisoindole&#8208;Based Stilbene Derivative Apparently over NonTriene Form</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 36, June 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imidazoleisoindole&#8208;based stilbene analogue undergoes E&#8211;Z photoisomerization and unusual photocyclization over a formal nontriene C&#9552;C&#9472;C&#9552;C&#9472;C&#9472;N structure, which is rationally supported by X&#8208;ray and DFT&#8208;based analyses. The photochemical quantum yields over 0.3 is observed for the cyclization reaction. While the hexatriene structure is assumed as a minor mesomeric form, the ground state HOMO/LUMO symmetry resembles usual diarylethenes and satisfies Woodward&#8211;Hoffmann rules for photocyclization.








Abstract
Diarylethene is one of the most extensively studied photochromic compounds due to its remarkable properties. Recently, nitrogen&#8208;based diarylethenes (DAEs) have been reported to exhibit unusual photochromic behavior. In this study, we synthesized an imidazoleisoindole&#8208;based stilbene analogue, which involves a neutral C&#9552;C&#9472;C&#9552;C&#9472;C&#9472;N framework, along with a C&#9552;C&#9472;C&#9552;C&#9472;C&#9552;N form as a minor mesomeric form. Crystal structural analysis supported the major contribution of the former form. Surprisingly, the molecule exhibited not only E&#8211;Z photoisomerization but also the photocyclization reaction with a quantum yield of 0.3. The orbital symmetry of the HOMO and LUMO around the reactive center closely resembled to that of typical DAEs and satisfied the Woodward&#8211;Hoffmann rules. Imidazolium analogue is also studied for comparison. The imidazoleisoindole&#8208;based stilbene analogue represents a novel and unusual example of photocyclization in DAEs, uncovering the importance of the symmetric feature of LUMO and HOMO around the reactive center for the photocyclization.

         <title>Functionalization, Fragmentation, and Expansion of cyclo&#8208;P4R2 Ligands</title>

Three isolobal transition metal (TM) units are demonstrated to impact the transformation of coordinated P4 ligands in different ways. The observed reactivity primarily depends on the nature of the TM, an effect so far underexplored in phosphorus chemistry. This in&#8208;depth analysis shines light on the underlying mechanistic principles and exploits them to access a plethora of unprecedented fully functionalized polyphosphorus compounds.








Abstract
In this study, three isolobal complexes of the form [{LnM}(&#951;3&#8208;P4R2)]+ ({LnM}&#160; = {CpMo(CO)2} (A), {Cp'''Ni} (B), {Cp'''Co}&#8211; (C), R = Ph, iPr; Cp''' = 1,2,4&#8208;tBu3C5H2) are reacted with nucleophilic carbenes (L). While C does not show any reactivity, the cationic complexes A and B undergo addition reactions. The respective products [CpMo(CO)2(&#951;3&#8208;P4R2L)]+ (1a &#8211; d) and [Cp'''Ni(&#951;1:1&#8208;P4R2L)]+ (3a &#8211; d) show different geometries for the L&#8208;P3PR2 ligands. Their reactivity towards EtO&#8211; results in either a simple addition (for 1) or a complex addition, ring&#8208;opening, rearrangement sequence (for 3). Moreover, [Cp'''Ni(&#951;2&#8208;IDippPP(OEt)PPiPr2)] (4) could be methylated by the reaction with MeOTf, which affords an iso&#8208;tetraphosphine ligand, marking the first example of complete functionalization of a polyphosphorus ligand to a complexed phosphine. Mechanistic studies shed light upon the fundamental principles, which differentiate the influence of the isolobal {CpMo(CO)2}, {Cp'''Ni}, and {Cp'''Co}&#8211; transition metal units. Lastly, 3a&#8211;d were chosen as model substrates for further nucleophilic functionalization. In this regard, 3 reacts with [CN]&#8722; in a [3+1] fragmentation reaction affording the dimerized species [{Cp'''Ni}2(&#956;,&#951;1:1:1:1&#8208;cyclo&#8208;P4(PR2)2)] (6a: R = Ph, 6b: R&#160; = &#160;iPr) together with IDippP&#8208;CN. In contrast, the reaction with [ECO]&#8722; (E = P, As) led to an extension of the pnictogen framework yielding [Cp'''Ni(&#951;1:1&#8208;EP4Ph2IDipp)] (8a: E = P, 8b: E = As).

         <title>Pyridyl/Phenyl&#8208;Appended Acrylonitrile &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Molecules: Thermally Stable Organic Crystals for Amplified Spontaneous Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 36, June 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized t&#8208;butyl&#8208; and pyridyl/phenyl&#8208;substituted CDSBs, forming emissive crystals via solution processing. Pyridyl groups influenced the crystal structure and enhanced thermal stability through hydrogen bonding, enabling ASE under intense laser irradiation. This highlights pyridyl modification as a strategy for stable, solid&#8208;state laser materials.








Abstract
Highly solid&#8208;state emissive molecular crystals have attracted attention as gain media for organic lasers. There is a need to develop solid&#8208;state luminescent molecules with excellent solubility and thermal stability through chemical design approaches despite the structural and functional diversity of organic molecular materials toward such media. Here, we report the synthesis and properties of the t&#8208;butyl&#8208; and pyridyl or phenyl&#8208;appended cyano&#8208;&#946;&#8208;substituted distyrylbenzenes (CDSBs). A solution process at room temperature could prepare each crystal of these molecules modified with pyridyl/phenyl. The crystal structure analysis results suggest that the difference in the pyridyl/phenyl group affects the crystal system. Solid&#8208;state emissions were similar due to the molecular structural differences affecting only the crystal structure. The emission spectrum of the crystal exhibited amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) properties with the formation of population inversion. However, the pyridyl&#8211;pyridyl interactions contributed to the thermal stability of the crystal, which was stable even under high&#8208;energy density laser irradiation. Therefore, molecular modification with the pyridyl group offers a new strategy for controlling crystal structures and rigid frameworks.

         <title>A Reductively Activatable Phototheranostic Agent Based on a Water&#8208;Soluble Nickel Naphthalocyanine Precursor</title>

This report describes the synthesis of nickel naphthalocyanine (NiNc) precursors bearing two alkoxy groups on their core structure and the evaluation as the turn&#8208;on&#8208;type photosensitizer for theranostics. In glutathione&#8208;overexpressing cancer cells, reductive conversion of the precursor proceeded efficiently, resulting in enhanced photoacoustic (PA) signal intensity and phototoxicity based on the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photothermal conversion of NiNc.








Abstract
Metal naphthalocyanine (MNc) is one of the most promising near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes as a photosensitizer for phototheranostics, combining photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and photothermal therapy (PTT). However, the extremely low solubility of MNc has limited its practical application as a theranostic agent. In this research, we synthesized NiNc precursors (ox&#8208;NiNc) having two alkoxy groups on the &#945;&#8208;carbons of the diagonal pyrroles with significantly improved solubility. We also prepared an amphiphilic derivative, ox&#8208;NiNc&#8208;PEG, and investigated its conversion to NiNc through reductive aromatization. We demonstrated that ox&#8208;NiNc&#8208;PEG was efficiently converted to NiNc in cancer cells with elevated glutathione levels, resulting in enhanced photoacoustic signals and increased phototoxicity based on photothermal conversion under NIR light irradiation. The target&#8208;oriented reductive aromatization in response to the reducing environment in cancer cells offers a critical strategy for developing PAI/PTT theranostic agents.

         <title>An Efficient Thiol&#8208;ene Mediated Protocol for Thiolated Peptide Synthesis and On&#8208;Resin Diversification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 36, June 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a sequential acyl&#8208;thiol&#8208;ene/S&#8208;deacetylation protocol for selective installation of thiol residues onto synthetic peptides, on&#8208;resin, is demonstrated. The hydrothiolation/S&#8208;deacetylation protocol offers a novel synthetic tool for direct peptide conjugation on&#8208;resin and for the preparation of novel disulfide containing neuropeptides displaying non&#8208;natural ring sizes without intermediate purification steps.








Abstract
The unique nucleophilic and redox properties of the sulfhydryl group render it highly useful as a synthetic handle for the diversification of peptide structure, including macrocyclization, ligation, and bioconjugation. Herein, a sequential acyl&#8208;thiol&#8208;ene/S&#8208;deacetylation protocol for selectively installing thiol residues onto bioactive peptides on&#8208;resin is demonstrated. Through judicious placement of appropriate unsaturated residues, the hydrothiolation/S&#8208;deacetylation protocol offers a novel synthetic strategy to investigate the structure&#8208;activity relationship of disulfide&#8208;containing peptides displaying different ring sizes. Furthermore, a new and generally applicable fluorescent labeling strategy is introduced to facilitate direct on&#8208;resin conjugation without intermediate purification steps. These new methods provide a robust and versatile platform for peptide macrocyclization and bioconjugation, with broad applications in peptide synthesis and chemical biology.

&lt;p&gt;Herein, a sequential acyl-thiol-ene/&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-deacetylation protocol for selective installation of thiol residues onto synthetic peptides, on-resin, is demonstrated. The hydrothiolation/S-deacetylation protocol offers a novel synthetic tool for direct peptide conjugation on-resin and for the preparation of novel disulfide containing neuropeptides displaying non-natural ring sizes without intermediate purification steps.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unique nucleophilic and redox properties of the sulfhydryl group render it highly useful as a synthetic handle for the diversification of peptide structure, including macrocyclization, ligation, and bioconjugation. Herein, a sequential acyl-thiol-ene/&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-deacetylation protocol for selectively installing thiol residues onto bioactive peptides on-resin is demonstrated. Through judicious placement of appropriate unsaturated residues, the hydrothiolation/&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-deacetylation protocol offers a novel synthetic strategy to investigate the structure-activity relationship of disulfide-containing peptides displaying different ring sizes. Furthermore, a new and generally applicable fluorescent labeling strategy is introduced to facilitate direct on-resin conjugation without intermediate purification steps. These new methods provide a robust and versatile platform for peptide macrocyclization and bioconjugation, with broad applications in peptide synthesis and chemical biology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Novel bispidine&#8208;based Cu(II) CPs show remarkable selective VOC adsorption and 1D to 2D transformations.








Abstract
This study presents novel bispidine&#8208;based Cu(II) coordination polymers (CPs) with remarkable dynamic properties, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) exchange, and selective adsorption capabilities. The coordination requirements of Cu(II) enable, as demonstrated by SC&#8208;XRD and Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (P&#8208;XRD), the formation of either 1D ribbon&#8208;like (1&#8208;TCMSC and 1&#8208;H2OSC) or 2D (1&#8208;MeCNSC) extended frameworks depending on the ability of the trapped solvents to interact as hydrogen bond (HB) donor with the metal's counterion. Hirshfeld Surface (HS) analysis and in situ VT SC&#8208; and P&#8208;XRD experiments reveal different interchain interactions in 1D vs 2D CPs. Solvent exchange experiments on both single crystals (SCs) and microcrystalline samples, set up to evaluate differences in the CPs&#8217; dynamic nature, confirm the drastic effect of CP dimensionality. Additionally, an amorphous desolvated phase 1&#8208;AmorphPwd was tested for VOC adsorption and demonstrated to display affinity for acetonitrile and nitromethane, with high selectivity for the latter, but also to have the ability to trap aromatic VOCs, capturing up to ca. 2&#160;mmol/g of solvent. The adsorption experiments, conducted at r.t., 1 atm, and no prior activation, underscore the potential of these materials for environmental and industrial applications. This work emphasizes the unique dynamic and selective behavior of bispidine&#8208;based CPs and provides a foundation for their scalability and practical implementation in VOCs capture technologies.

         <dc:description>
The total synthesis of the 5/5/5/6 caged&#8208;like natural product daphnenoid A has been accomplished for the first time. The synthesis features NHK coupling to prepare a precursor (12) and a Michael/Michael cascade to forge a norbornane scaffold.








Abstract
Total synthesis of the 5/5/5/6 caged&#8208;like natural product daphnenoid A was accomplished for the first time. The de novo synthesis started with the commercially available (R)&#8208;carvone. A key Nozaki&#8208;Hiyama&#8208;Kishi reaction was employed to build the precusor for the stepwise Mukaiyama Michael/Michael cascade which constructed a norbornane substructure. The caged tetracarbocyclic skeleton was forged using the ring closure metathesis.

         <title>Reversible Decarbonylation of a Metal Phosphaketene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 36, June 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a metalated phosphastannene through the base&#8208;induced decarbonylation of a metal phosphaethynolate complex is described. This decarbonylation reaction appears to be reversible, allowing for the transfer of the phosphaethynolate moiety to other metal centers through salt&#8208;metathesis reactions with concomitant release of a stannylene.








Abstract
The synthesis of a metalated phosphastannene by reaction of the known cobalt(I) phosphaketene complex Co(DippPDI)(PCO) (DippPDI = 1,1&#8242;&#8208;(pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;diyl)bis(N&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;imine) with Sn[CH(SiMe3)2]2 is described. The resulting compound, Co(DippPDI)(CO){P&#9552;Sn[CH(SiMe3)2]2}, contains a localized P&#9552;Sn double bond, yet reacts like a phosphaketene transfer reagent, suggesting that, in solution, Co(DippPDI)(CO){P&#9552;Sn[CH(SiMe3)2]2} appears to exist in equilibrium with Co(DippPDI)(PCO) and Sn[CH(SiMe3)2]2. This is facilitated by the fact that, on decarbonylation with Sn[CH(SiMe3)2]2, the carbon monoxide extruded from the phosphaketene precursor Co(DippPDI)(PCO) remains in the coordination sphere of cobalt. The novel phosphaketene compounds (IDipp)Au(PCO) (IDipp = 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) and (DippNacNac)Zn(PCO) (DippNacnac = HC[C(Me)N(Dipp)]2; Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) can be synthesized by reaction of Co(DippPDI)(CO){P&#9552;Sn[CH(SiMe3)2]2} with Au(IDipp)Cl or (DippNacNac)ZnCl&#183;LiCl(OEt2)2, respectively. In the case of the former, the released stannylene Sn[CH(SiMe3)2]2 ultimately inserts into the Au&#9472;PCO bond, affording the tin(IV) complex (IDipp)AuSn(PCO)[CH(SiMe3)2]2.

         <title>Structural Insights and Advanced Spectroscopic Characterization of Thiazolothiazoles: Unveiling Potential for Optoelectronic and Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 36, June 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
TzTz derivatives are promising materials for flexible optoelectronic and sensing applications due to their easy synthesis, tunable properties, and stability. This study analyzes 10 TzTz derivatives, detailing their synthesis, spectroscopic characterization (FTIR, NMR, UV&#8208;Vis), fluorescence behavior, and synchrotron XANES findings, showcasing their potential for advanced electronic and optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
Thiazolothiazoles (TzTzs) are planar, &#960;&#8208;conjugated heterocyclic compounds exhibiting unique structural and optoelectronic properties. In this study, a series of symmetrically substituted thiazolothiazole (TzTz) derivatives including imidazolyl, o&#8208;vanillyl, p&#8208;vanillyl, phenyl, thiazolyl, cinnamoyl, and trifluoromethylphenyl were synthesized and extensively characterized using X&#8208;ray crystallography (XRD), Fourier&#8208;transformed infrared (FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and ultraviolet&#8208;visible (UV&#8208;Vis) spectroscopies, photoluminescence, X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure (XANES, S K&#8208;edge), and density functional calculations. The compounds demonstrated diverse intermolecular interactions, including &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking and chalcogen bonding, which directly influenced their optical properties and electronic band structures. Several derivatives displayed promising features such as large Stokes shifts over 0.4&#160;eV in solution and up to 1&#160;eV in solid state and reversible resistive switching behavior, positioning them as attractive candidates for use in optoelectronic devices and emerging memristive technologies.

In this study, a series of symmetrically substituted thiazolothiazole (TzTz) derivatives including imidazolyl, &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-vanillyl, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-vanillyl, phenyl, thiazolyl, cinnamoyl, and trifluoromethylphenyl were synthesized and extensively characterized using X-ray crystallography (XRD), Fourier-transformed infrared (FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopies, photoluminescence, X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES, S K-edge), and density functional calculations. The compounds demonstrated diverse intermolecular interactions, including &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt; stacking and chalcogen bonding, which directly influenced their optical properties and electronic band structures. Several derivatives displayed promising features such as large Stokes shifts over 0.4&#160;eV in solution and up to 1&#160;eV in solid state and reversible resistive switching behavior, positioning them as attractive candidates for use in optoelectronic devices and emerging memristive technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Anionic Vanadium Thionitrosyl Complex Supported by an Anilide&#8208;Bis(aryloxide) Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reaction of [{K(dme)}{(ONO)V&#8801;N}]2 ([ONO]3&#8211; = anilide&#8208;bis(aryloxide)) with elemental sulfur afforded an anionic thionitrosyl complex [K(dme)4][(ONO)V(NS)], which could be isolated as a dark red solid. The solid&#8208;state metrical parameters suggest that it is best described with a thio&#8208;imido resonance form. The thionitrosyl complex was shown to react with a variety of substrates at the thionitrosyl sulfur atom and across the V&#8211;N bond. Reaction with PPh3 occurred with sulfur atom transfer to form the nitride and SPPh3. The thionitrosyl complex underwent S&#8208;alkylation with alkyl halides to form a sulfenylimido complex [(ONO)V(NSR)] (R = Me, CH2C6H4&#8208;4&#8208;Me). Reactions with Me3SiCl and BPh3 resulted in the formation of [(ONO)V(NSiMe3)] and [K(dme)4][(ONO)V(NBPh3)] along with concomitant loss of sulfur. When treated with CO2, CS2, and PhNCS, the reactions took place across the V&#8211;N bond to generate [(ONO)VE] (E = O, S). The thionitrosyl complex was unstable in toluene and underwent dimerization via loss of K2S to afford [{(ONO)V}2(&#956;&#8208;NSN)]. Reaction of the thionitrosyl complex with [Cp2Fe][PF6] gave a mixture of products containing the NSN complex and [{(ONO)V}2(&#956;&#8208;NSSN)].</dc:description>

         <title>Zirconium&#8208;Mediated Hydroaminoalkylation of Conjugated Dienes Probed by a Computational Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An in&#8208;depth computational probe of the hydroaminoalkylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes with N&#8208;aryl substituted amines by a tethered bis(ureate)&#8208;ligated zirconium compound is reported. The mechanistic proposal derived from smooth energy profiles acquired by employing a reliable computational protocol complies with previous experimental mechanistic studies, providing a more advanced understanding of intricate mechanistic aspects. The high degree of regioselectivity achieved for reversible diene insertion and butenyl tether protonolysis is instrumental for the generation of main product, (E)&#8208;4,1 linear homoallylic amine. Product liberation and regeneration of the zirconaaziridine favours a two&#8208;step sequence comprising transamination with incoming amine, followed by &#946;&#8208;hydrogen abstraction at the intervening zircona bis&#8208;amide. The irreversible transamination is likely the regioselectivity&#8208;determining event that dictates the product composition. The &#946;&#8208;hydrogen abstraction at the zircona bis&#8208;amide, which likely constitutes the catalyst resting state, is turnover limiting. Its DFT&#8208;assessed defining barrier conforms with reported catalyst performance data. The role of the smaller, more nucleophilic dimethylamide in the catalytic transformation has been revealed.</dc:description>

         <title>Ni&#8208;metalated Ge9&#160;Zintl clusters as single site homogeneous catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Homogeneous catalytic reactions performed without or with highly abundant transition metals is an increasing field of research due to cost&#8208;effectiveness and sustainability. Therefore, using main group element Zintl cluster as support material for transition metals via synthesizing single site homogeneous catalysts (SSHoC) could be a way to make such metals feasible for catalysis, without the risk of metal loss or agglomeration like in classical single site catalysts. A synthetic protocol for four cluster compounds K[Hyp3Ge9NiPR3] (Hyp&#160;=&#160;Si(SiMe3)3;&#160;R = Ph, ptolyl, iPr, Me, 1&#8208;4) is presented, in which the nickel atom is embedded into the cluster core. The products were characterized by NMR spectroscopy, ESI/MS as well as for 1 and 3 by single crystal X&#8208;ray structure determination comprising a closo&#8208;[Ge9Ni] core. The cleavage of the triphenylphosphine ligand in 1 in THF, with and without 2.2.2&#8208;crypt, and acetonitrile as well as the isomerization of 1&#8208;hexene in the same solvents have been investigated via NMR spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with reversible redox&#8208;active units are promising materials for electrochemical energy storage devices. The highly extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated redox&#8208;active PPDA&#8208;TFPT&#8208;COF is synthesized via Schiff&#8208;base condensation between p&#8208;phenylenediamine (PPDA) and 2,4,6&#8208;tris&#8208;(p&#8208;formyl phenoxy)1,3,5&#8208;triazine (TFPT) monomers. The ample redox active sites of PPDA&#8208;TFPT&#8208;COF enabled exceptional energy storage, achieving a maximum specific capacitance of 250 F g&#8208;1 and an energy density of 34.72 Wh kg&#8208;1 at a power density of 500 W kg&#8208;1 at 1 A g&#8208;1 current density. The material demonstrated extraordinary cycling stability, retaining over 100% capacitance after 5000 cycles at 7 A g&#8208;1 current density. This superior performance is attributed to &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, abundant redox&#8208;active centers, and an efficient charge transport pathway, making it an ideal supercapacitor electrode material.

         <title>Synthesis of Cyclopentadienyl Rhodium Catalysts by Co&#8208;Cyclization of Two Different Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclopentadienyl rhodium complexes (C5R5)RhLx are widely used as homogeneous catalysts. Herein we report the synthesis of such complexes with structurally diverse cyclopentadienyl ligands in one step directly from alkynes. Specifically, reactions of bulky terminal alkynes (tert&#8208;butylacetylene or trimethylsilylacetylene) with activated internal alkynes (ethyl 2&#8208;butynoate or dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate) and [(cod)RhCl]2 produce either cyclopentadienyl or pentalene&#8208;type complexes (L)Rh(cod) in 60&#8208;95% yields. Oxidation of these Rh(I) complexes with halogens afforded the corresponding Rh(III) derivatives [(L)RhHal2]2 which can catalyze C&#8208;H activation of phenylhydroxamate giving products with varying regioselectivity depending on the substituents in pi&#8208;ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Luminescent Systems with High&#8208;Contrast Fluorescence and Phosphorescence through a Host&#8208;Guest Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have received significant attention because of their potential applications in information storage, bioimaging, sensors, and so on. However, the design of high&#8208;performance stimulus&#8208;responsive RTP materials remains challenging. In this work, multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive RTP systems are constructed by utilizing the acid&#8208;base responsive properties of the pyridine group, the heavy&#8208;atom effect of halogen and sulfur atoms, and d&#8208;p&#960; bonds. Six phenothiazine derivatives are designed and synthesized.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Abstract: Organic room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have received significant attention because of their potential applications in information storage, bioimaging, sensors, and so on. However, the design of high-performance stimulus-responsive RTP materials remains challenging. In this work, multi-stimuli-responsive RTP systems are constructed by utilizing the acid-base responsive properties of the pyridine group, the heavy-atom effect of halogen and sulfur atoms, and d-p&#960; bonds. Six phenothiazine derivatives are designed and synthesized. A systematic investigation is conducted on the effects of molecular structure, molecular conformation, stacking modes, and intermolecular interactions on their luminescence properties. Using phenothiazine derivatives as guests and their corresponding 5,5-dioxide phenothiazine derivatives as hosts, host-guest doping is achieved through slow solvent evaporation and melting blending methods. The host-guest doping system exhibits highly efficient and long-lived phosphorescence through the formation of triplet exciplexes, with a phosphorescence quantum yield of up to 63.6%. The doping systems exhibit higher-contrast acid-base, acid-thermal, and multistimuli-responsive luminescence characteristics than the single compounds. The potential applications of these systems in sensors, multicolor patterning, and multi-information encryption are explored.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Diverse Array of Catalytic Photoredox Reactions Based on Alu&#8208;minum(III)&#8208;Salen Complexes: Understanding the Enhancement of Catalytic Activity via Amine Association</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the diversity of the photoredox reactions based on Al&#8208;salen catalysts. The combination of an Al&#8208;salen catalyst with an amine under visible&#8208;light irradiation allowed the reductive transformations of aryl chlorides, carbonyl compounds, and perfluoroalkylarenes, and the oxidative transformations of amines. Mechanistic studies using transient absorption spectroscopy suggested that the Al&#8208;salen complex associates with the amine via its vacant site to improve its excited&#8208;state reducing power.








Abstract
Since aluminum is an earth&#8208;abundant and environmentally benign main&#8208;group metal, the development of aluminum&#8208;complex&#8208;based photoredox catalysts remains a significant issue. Herein, we report aluminum(III)&#8208;salen complexes (Al&#8208;salens) as versatile photoredox catalysts. The combination of an Al&#8208;salen catalyst with an amine under visible&#8208;light irradiation allowed the hydrodechlorinative transformations of aryl chlorides, the reductive coupling of carbonyl compounds, and the defluoroallylation of perfluoroalkylarenes. Mechanistic studies using transient absorption spectroscopy suggested that the Al&#8208;salen complex associates with the amine via its vacant site to improve the reducing ability of its excited state. After electron transfer between the excited state of the Al&#8208;salen/amine complex and an appropriate oxidant, the generated aminium radical cation is leveraged to achieve the oxidative transformations of amines, such as &#945;&#8208;arylation and &#945;&#8208;cyanation. The diversity of the catalytic photoredox reactions based on Al&#8208;salen complexes is comparable to that of heavy&#8208;precious&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts.

         <dc:description>Allenes are a class of important organic compounds, and their synthesis has always been of great interest. In this article, we have developed a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed photoredox strategy, providing an alternative and efficient approach for the synthesis of 1,3&#8208;diarylallenes from propargyl alcohols. The reaction utilized organic amines as a hydrogen source to avoid the use of conventional hydride additives, and does not require the addition of extra ligands to activate the cobalt catalyst, achieving a mild reaction condition. As a result, the reaction was able to synthesize the desired 1,3&#8208;diarylallene compounds with good yields and functional group compatibility.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling Topology of a Telomeric G&#8208;quadruplex DNA With a Chemical Cross&#8208;link</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermodynamically stable G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) DNA: Chemical cross&#8208;linking between distant nucleotides led to formation of G4&#8208;DNA that is stable in the presence of complementary DNA. This methodology can be used to reliably form G4s within DNA fibers for subsequent structural studies of G4&#8208;protein interactions.








Abstract
DNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) are noncanonical structures formed in guanine&#8208;rich sequences. Within the human genome, they are nonrandomly distributed and influence DNA replication, gene expression, and genome maintenance. Numerous proteins involved in these processes have been identified as G4&#8208;binding proteins. However, the interaction of proteins with G4s in the context of double&#8208;stranded DNA in vitro has been difficult to study due to the transient nature of G4s in the presence of complementary DNA. To overcome this challenge, introducing internal covalent cross&#8208;links between distant nucleotides within the DNA sequence may promote pre&#8208;folding of G4 structures, thereby shifting the thermodynamic equilibrium toward G4&#8208;formation. We used a Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition to create a cross&#8208;link between 2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;propargylguanosine and N6&#8208;azidoethyl&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine in the DNA telomeric sequence (TAG3T)2. A cross&#8208;link between G3 and A8 reinforced the parallel G4 topology that was stable in the presence of complementary DNA. Moreover, even in the presence of its complementary strand, this cross&#8208;linked G4 recruited the parent native DNA (TAG3T)2 to form a hybrid G4. These results suggest that cross&#8208;linking provides a useful tool for stabilizing noncanonical DNA structures in the presence of complementary strands, enabling their study within the context of genomic DNA.

         <title>Nucleophilic Addition versus Migratory Insertion Pathways in the Gold&#8208;Catalysed Heck Reaction: A Computational Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The initial reaction steps in the formation of Heck&#8208;type arylated alkenes catalysed by P^N chelated Au(III) complexes have been studied computationally. Two mechanistic alternatives have been explored: (1) alkene coordination and insertion into a gold&#8208;carbon bond, and (2) nucleophilic attack on a gold(III) alkene adduct. The common starting point, the [(P^N)AuPh(alkene)]2+ dication (alkene = C2H4, H2C=CHEt or H2C=CEt2), shows unequal bonding to the olefinic carbons of the 1&#8208;alkenes (P^N = 1,2&#8208;C6H4NMe2(PR2); R = H, Me, 1&#8208;adamantyl). This polarisation increases with steric hindrance and with inclusion of an OTf&#8209; anion in the model. While the reaction pathways are strongly governed by the trans&#8208;influence of the ligand, the effects of steric hindrance in the ligand and alkene are remarkably small. In all cases the nucleophilic attack pathway is energetically favoured. However, changing the ligand from a P^N to a P^P chelate, with a strongly electron&#8208;donating &#8208;PMe2 donor trans to Ph, sufficiently destabilises the Au&#8208;Ph bond to make alkene insertion competitive. Alkene 1,2 insertion regiochemistry is always preferred, unlike Pd&#8208;catalysed Heck reaction that requires a 2,1&#8208;insertion. Based on these results, an alkene insertion pathway en&#8208;route to Heck&#8208;type olefins can therefore be ruled out.</dc:description>

         <title>Skeletal Editing of Alkenes and Alkynes via Single&#8208;Carbon&#8208;Atom Insertion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically surveys progress since 2017 in single&#8208;carbon insertion into alkenes and alkynes, emphasizing mechanistic insights, substrate scope, and synthetic utility. We highlight key methodologies, discuss unresolved challenges, and outline future directions for this rapidly evolving field, with potential applications in complex molecule synthesis and functional material design.








Abstract
Skeletal editing has emerged as a pivotal complement to retrosynthetic analysis strategies. This approach enables simple bulk chemical feedstocks to achieve precise atomic&#8208;level modifications&#8212;such as insertion, deletion, or swapping&#8212;facilitating the rapid assembly of complex, high value&#8208;added functional organic molecules. Currently, single&#8208;carbon&#8208;atom insertion reactions predominantly emphasize the functionalization of (hetero)aromatic systems, leaving the site&#8208;specific editing of unsaturated C&#9472;C bond frameworks such as alkenes and alkynes, comparatively underexplored. This review provides detailed analysis and summary of recent progress in the skeletal editing of functional alkenes and alkynes derivatives via single&#8208;carbon&#8208;atom insertion, and outlining the future potential directions of this technology.

         <title>Biodegradable Elastomers: Where Is the Solution?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective explores the scientific and translational challenges in developing biodegradable elastomers as sustainable alternatives to traditional rubbers. It highlights polysaccharide&#8208;based architectures, dynamic covalent and supramolecular chemistries, and the trade&#8208;offs between durability and degradation. Emphasis is placed on aligning material design with regulatory frameworks, public education, and STEM integration to scale real&#8208;world, environmentally responsible solutions.








Abstract
The last three decades have witnessed a paradigm shift in the polymer industry, driven by the urgent need for sustainable materials. Growing awareness of environmental sustainability, coupled with increasingly stringent chemical regulations, has catalyzed significant investments in sustainable polymer materials. While much of the focus has been on plastics, rubbery materials have received comparatively less attention. With mechanical and chemical recycling as the current primary mode for disposing rubber waste, prospects for a suitable pathway to minimize hazardous microplastics derived from these highly crosslinked polymers sources seem bleak. This article aims to envision a future where the pathway toward biodegradable rubber materials becomes a more realistic possibility. We delve into the challenges, advancements, and future perspectives of biodegradable rubbery materials, with a particular emphasis on exploring the potential of utilizing polysaccharides derived from biomass combined with synthetic elastomers &#8211; including the utilization of dynamic covalent bonding and supramolecular chemistry approaches. In addition to the discussion on scientific questions, we address complementary issues on STEM education to put forth a more comprehensive vision for sustainability relating to broader society.

         <title>Reactivity of &#948;&#8208;Functionalized Para&#8208;Quinone Methides in Nucleophilic Addition Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivities of &#948;&#8208;functionalized para&#8208;quinone methides (pQMs) were characterized by kinetic studies of their reactions with carbanions in DMSO. Evaluating the second&#8208;order rate constants (k2) by the Mayr&#8208;Patz equation gave the electrophilicities E of pQMs. Reactivities of unseen &#948;&#8208;functionalized pQMs can be predicted by using the linear relationship of E with a combination of quantum chemically calculated methyl anion affinities (MAA) and buried volumes (%Vbur).








Abstract
The electrophilic reactivities of para&#8208;quinone methides (pQMs) with functional groups (FG) at the exocyclic polarized carbon&#8211;carbon double bond were determined by photometrically monitoring the kinetics of their reactions with carbanions in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 20 &#176;C. The experimental second&#8208;order rate constants k2 were evaluated by the Mayr&#8208;Patz equation, that is, the linear free energy relationship lg k2&#160;=&#160;sN(N&#160;+&#160;E), which was leveraged to determine the electrophilicity descriptors E of the pQMs. These electrophilicity parameters E were subsequently used to successfully predict the scope of the pQM reactions with C&#8208;, H&#8208;, N&#8208;, O&#8208;, and S&#8208;centered nucleophiles. Moreover, the electrophilicity parameters E correlate linearly with a linear combination of quantum&#8208;chemically calculated methyl anion affinities (MAAs) and buried volumes (%Vbur). While MAA values mainly reflect the thermodynamic driving force of the carbon&#8211;carbon bond formation, %Vbur values take account of the variable steric effects of substituents at the electrophilic &#948;&#8208;position of the pQMs. Knowledge of MAA and %Vbur thus enables chemists to tailor novel pQMs with predictable reactivity properties.

         <title>Benzo&#8208;Extended Thiaquasi[7]Circulenes: Strategic Scholl&#8208;Type Synthesis, Tunable Electronic, and Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through Scholl oxidative cyclization, we efficiently synthesize unique &#960;&#8208;conjugated TQCs in high yield. These molecules feature a negatively curved geometry, bifacial aromatic&#8211;antiaromatic character, and tunable optoelectronic properties with enhanced fluorescence and mechanochromic luminescence. Their exceptional redox activity and electrochemical stability make TQCs promising for organic electronics and energy storage.








Abstract
Thia&#8208;quasi[7]circulenes (TQCs) are a novel class of &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules exhibiting unique electronic, optical, and electrochemical properties. We report a highly efficient bottom&#8208;up synthesis of TQCs via Scholl oxidative cyclization, achieving exceptional yields and structural precision. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis confirms their negatively curved geometry, featuring a central antiaromatic heptagonal core and a surrounding aromatic rim, leading to bifacial electronic properties. TQCs demonstrate stable redox behavior with tunable Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO)&#8211;Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) energy levels. Their remarkable electrochemical stability highlights potential as redox&#8208;active materials. TQCs exhibit blue&#8208;shifted fluorescence compared to carbo&#8208;quasi[7]circulenes, with enhanced quantum yields upon benzoannulation. Additionally, they display mechanochromic luminescence upon grinding, revealing tunable molecular characteristics. These findings establish TQCs as versatile molecular frameworks, bridging fundamental chemistry and next&#8208;generation functional materials, making them promising candidates for organic electronics, energy storage, and optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Influence of Compactness and Crystallinity on Hole Transfer Ability of Nickel Oxide Layer in Modal Coupling Regime</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates how structural properties influence the hole migration behavior of nickel oxide (NiOx). Our findings reveal that both crystallinity and compactness significantly affect the hole transport capability of NiOx layers. The Au&#8208;NPs/NiOx/Pt&#8208;film photocathode exhibited cathodic photocurrent at wavelengths below 800&#160;nm, with a maximum incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency of 0.16% at 600&#160;nm.








Abstract
This study investigates how structural properties influence the hole migration behavior of nickel oxide (NiOx) by evaluating its photoelectrochemical performance. Two fabrication methods were employed for preparing NiOx layers. One is a sol&#8208;gel wet process, which allows wide&#8208;area coating without the need for specialized equipment. The other is atomic layer deposition (ALD), which enables uniform and conformal coverage on 3D surfaces with the compact oxide layer by leveraging a self&#8208;limiting, layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth mechanism. Our findings reveal that both crystallinity and compactness significantly affect the hole transport capability of NiOx layers. We further integrated the NiOx layer as a hole transport layer in an Au&#8208;NPs/NiOx/Pt&#8208;film photocathode operating under a modal coupling regime. This photocathode exhibited cathodic photocurrent at wavelengths below 800&#160;nm, with a maximum incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency of 0.16% at 600&#160;nm. These results demonstrate that not only the hole injection process but also hole migration properties of the NiOx layer influence the charge separation under modal coupling conditions.

The other is atomic layer deposition (ALD), which enables uniform and conformal coverage on 3D surfaces with the compact oxide layer by leveraging a self-limiting, layer-by-layer growth mechanism. Our findings reveal that both crystallinity and compactness significantly affect the hole transport capability of NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; layers. We further integrated the NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; layer as a hole transport layer in an Au-NPs/NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/Pt-film photocathode operating under a modal coupling regime. This photocathode exhibited cathodic photocurrent at wavelengths below 800&#160;nm, with a maximum incident photon-to-current efficiency of 0.16% at 600&#160;nm. These results demonstrate that not only the hole injection process but also hole migration properties of the NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; layer influence the charge separation under modal coupling conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Li Heteroepitaxial Deposition on Single Crystalline Ni Substrates With Enhanced Cycling Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The heteroepitaxial Li deposition occurs on single&#8208;crystalline Ni(110) substrates, exhibiting the same {110}&lt;001&gt;&#160;texture with the substrate and a planar morphology. Using the {110}&#8208;textured epitaxial layer as the Li anode, the Li||LiPeO4 full cell presents improved cycle life, compared with the {111}&#8208;textured Li anode and untextured Li anode.








Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal is recognized as a highly promising anode material for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries. Nonetheless, dendrite growth and low coulombic efficiency (CE) significantly impede the practical application of Li metal anodes. The deposition morphology and chemical stability of Li are intricately linked to its crystallographic orientation. This study presents a substrate engineering approach that employs single&#8208;crystalline nickel (Ni) to facilitate epitaxial Li deposition due to their excellent lattice matching. The findings reveal that the Ni(110) substrate exhibits a more pronounced heteroepitaxial effect than Ni(111). A robust {110}&#8208;textured Li deposition was prepared on Ni(110) with a uniform planar morphology due to the lower Li self&#8208;diffusion barrier on the Li(110) plane. The {110}&#8208;textured Li epitaxial deposition improves the cycling stability in Ni&#8208;Li cells and full cells. Notably, the Li||LiFePO4 full cell utilizing the {110}&#8208;textured Li anode exhibits a high capacity retention of 109.6 mAh cm&#8722;2 over 350 cycles at 1 C under a low negative&#8208;to&#8208;positive capacity ratio of 1.26. This investigation highlights the crucial role of substrate&#8208;induced heteroepitaxy in improving Li plating/stripping dynamics and provides insights for the development of stable Li metal anodes by crystallographic orientation modification.

         <dc:description>We report an efficient double&#8208;click strategy combining copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) with (thia&#8208;)Diels&#8211;Alder (DA) reactions, enabled by newly designed heterobifunctional platforms bearing orthogonal clickable groups: alkyne&#8211;dithioester, alkyne&#8211;maleimide, or azide&#8211;diene. These platforms were evaluated through both one&#8208;pot sequential protocols (CuAAC/DA or CuAAC/thia&#8208;DA) and three&#8208;component reactions (3CR), using model substrates with complementary functionalities. The use of a highly reactive s&#8208;cis&#8208;constrained exocyclic diene, enabled rapid cycloadditions with maleimide or phosphonodithioester dienophiles. All reactions were performed under mild, biocompatible conditions (37&#8239;&#176;C, 1:1 H&#8322;O/iPrOH, 1&#8208;2&#8239;h), and most afforded the desired conjugates in good isolated yields. The methodology was further validated through the successful bioconjugation of three small peptides with either a fluorophore or biotin, demonstrating its efficiency, versatility, and compatibility with biologically relevant functional groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Single Sodium&#8208;Ion Conducting Sulfonated Polytriazole and Composite Electrolyte Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ongoing energy crisis and the increasing demand for lithium metal batteries (LMBs) have raised concerns about the availability and affordability of lithium. In light of their abundance and lower production costs, sodium metal batteries (SMBs) have the potential to replace LMBs. However, due to the reactivity of organic electrolytes with the sodium anode, it is essential to design safer electrolytes to prevent short&#8208;circuiting. This study focuses on the design and evaluation of fillers and single&#8208;ion conducting polymer electrolytes (SICPEs), including Na&#8208;SGO, PTSICPE&#8208;90, and various blend composites, which outperform Celgard 2400 in terms of thermal, mechanical, and dimensional stability. The Na&#8208;SGO filler demonstrated a desirable Na&#8208;ion conductivity of 11.91 &#215; 10&#8208;2 Scm&#8208;1 at 90 &#176;C in a solvated state. Due to the high solvent absorption (70 wt.%), good wettability (22.2&#176;), and significant porosity (58%) of the SICPEs, notable Na&#8208;ion conductivities of 0.23 &#215; 10&#8208;5 Scm&#8208;1 (non&#8208;solvated at 30 &#176;C) and 1.17 &#215; 10&#8208;5 Scm&#8208;1 (solvated at 40 &#176;C) were observed. These properties make them an appealing choice for electrolytic applications in SMBs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report a mechanochemical approach for the ruthenium catalyzed trifluoromethylation of arylboronic acids and phenols under the synergy of trifluoromethylacetamide and pyrylium tetrafluoroborate (Pyry&#8208;BF&#8324;). This is the first ever report on trifluoromethylation using in situ generated of N&#8208;trifluoromethylpyridinium tetrafluoroborate as the CF3 source under ball&#8208;milling conditions. The present one&#8208;pot transformation enabled direct trifluoromethylation of arylboronic acids and phenols to deliver the respective trifluoromethyl arenes and aryl trifluoromethyl ethers. It has also shown a remarkable compatibility toward aroyltrifluoroborates for the mechanochemical synthesis of aryl trifluoromethyl ketones. This method offers several advantages, including operational simplicity and broad substrate compatibility. Moreover, the current mechanochemical approach not only proceeds under sustainable conditions but also provides a practical route for the late&#8208;stage modifications of related substrates to access the valuable fluorinated compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Ring Cleavage for Ring Construction: Oxidative Heterocyclic Segregation toward Tribenzophenanthrolines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Let's scrap and build! Skeletal editing induced by two&#8208;electron oxidation of selenadiazole&#8208;fused quinodimethane enables preparative&#8208;scale synthesis of hexacyclic derivatives of phenanthroline, which afford fluorescent metal complexes. In this process, the two nitrogen atoms within a single heterocycle in the starting material are segregated into two different ring systems in the product.








Abstract
Intramolecular double C&#9472;N bond formation followed by deselenylation enables a one&#8208;pot skeletal editing of selenadiazole&#8208;fused naphthoquinodimethanes into previously unknown tribenzophenanthroline derivatives, which serve as precursors to fluorescent metal complexes. This transformation involves the disappearance of the original selenadiazole ring containing two nitrogen atoms and the concurrent formation of two new pyridine rings, each containing a single nitrogen atom. This &#8220;heterocyclic segregation (Het&#8208;Seg)&#8221; reaction is triggered by two&#8208;electron oxidation of sterically congested quinodimethane substrates with a folded geometry. The resulting twisted dicationic intermediates are crucial for driving the unique skeletal reorganization.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled Ni&#8208;C Bond Formation via Selective Gas&#8208;Phase C&#8722;C Bond Cleavage in 1,3&#8208;Diketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanistic investigations into the selective cleavage of C&#8722;C bonds to form M&#8722;C (M: metal) bonds are crucial for the comprehension, optimization, and design of chemical reactions. In this study, collision&#8208;induced dissociation experiments reveal that [(phen)NiL]+ (where L and phen represent a 1,3&#8208;diketone ligand and 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, respectively) cations facilitate the selective cleavage of C&#8722;C bonds, leading to the formation of alkyl&#8208;metal ions possessing M&#8722;C bonds. In contrast, the [NiL]+ cation, without the phen ligand, produces small neutral molecules, such as CH4, CO, and C6H6. Theoretical calculations suggest that a decarboxylation&#8208;like mechanism is responsible for the generation of the M&#8722;C bond in [(phen)Ni(bac)]+ (bac = benzoylacetone). Although the phen ligand is not directly involved in the fragmentation of nickel complex cations, it significantly alters the electronic structures and fragmentation mechanisms of nickel complex cations. This work presents a novel approach for the generation of M&#8722;C bonds through a gas&#8208;phase method, and provides molecular&#8208;level insights into the selective cleavage of C&#8722;C bonds in homogeneous catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Orthogonal Photoswitching in Nematic Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoresponsive liquid crystals can be obtained by doping with molecular photoswitches. Photoisomerization results in a fast and reversible transition between the&#160;nematic liquid crystalline and isotropic liquid phase. Simultaneous doping with two orthogonal photoswitches enables optical manipulation of the liquid crystal using selected wavelength ranging from ultraviolet to near infrared light.








Abstract
Photoresponsive materials capable of orthogonal and path&#8208;independent switching are crucial for developing adaptive materials and smart technologies. In this work, we showcase a dual light&#8208;responsive nematic liquid crystalline system based on peri&#8208;anthracenethioindigo (PAT) and arylazopyrazole (AAP) doped into the liquid crystal 4&#8208;cyano&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;pentylbiphenyl (5CB). The co&#8208;assembled supramolecular material exhibits a reversible phase transition between the nematic liquid crystalline and isotropic liquid state upon irradiation with different wavelengths of light ranging from ultraviolet to near infrared. These transformations are clearly visible using polarized optical microscopy, displaying either bright birefringent or completely dark images depending on the phase state. A key feature of this system is its ability to achieve independent and highly efficient photoisomerization of both photoswitches, ensuring orthogonality and path independence in solution as well as in the liquid crystalline phase. This orthogonal switching capability enables precise and reversible modulation of material properties, allowing sequential interconversion between multiple distinct states. Such a system represents an important proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for future multifunctional materials that leverage light as a noninvasive external stimulus.

         <title>Dual Excitation and Dual Emission in a 1,4&#8208;Diazepine Bearing an Extended &#960;&#8208;System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclodehydrogenation of a previously reported nanographene BDI leads to the formation of a 1,4&#8208;diazepine via scandium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H bond formation. This compound exhibits a unique combination of dual excitation and dual emission. The dual emission was found to be caused by a combination of charge transfer and geometric relaxation in the excited state.








Abstract
We present the synthesis of a benzo[b]benzo[11,12]tetracene[5,6&#8208;ef][1,4]diazepine (BBTDZ) and a benzo[g]phenanthro[9,10,1&#8208;cde]indazolium (BPIZ), two novel N&#8208;heterocyclic nanographenes. Both molecules were independently isolated from 2,3&#8208;Dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ)&#8208;mediated cyclodehydrogenation reaction of the previously reported benzo[f,g]tetracene &#946;&#8208;diketiminate (BT&#8208;BDI). Our mechanistic investigation shows the instrumental role of Sc(OTf)3 in allowing for C&#9472;N bond formation over N&#9472;N bond formation. Unexpectedly, the BBTDZ compound shows unique dual emission and dual excitation (DE/DE) properties. A combination of spectroscopic and computational studies provides a rationalization of these features. Charge transfer followed by geometric relaxation were found to cause the dual, strongly red&#8208;shifted emission. The understanding of both the reaction mechanism and mechanism of DE/DE can contribute to the rational design of materials with unique photophysical properties.

From fleeting intermediates to well&#8208;defined molecular structures, carbenes (neutral divalent carbon) remind us that the most reactive ideas often make a large impact. Despite their wide&#8208;ranging applications, the direct characterization of these reactive species remains a persistent experimental challenge. This concept article explores widely adopted strategies for their detection and structural elucidation, highlighting both their capabilities and limitations.

         <title>Significant Enhancement in Performance and Durability of Near&#8208;Infrared Reflective Flexible Triboelectric Nanogenerators Through Surface Modification Strategy via Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a surface modification strategy for boosting performance and durability of ITO&#8208;free flexible TENG via self&#8208;assembled monolayers, yielding record&#8208;high power density (27.28&#160;W/m2) and excellent durability upon 5,000 times of bending. Moreover, through optical design for the electrode, our TENG can unprecedentedly exhibit reduced heat gain from solar radiation.








Abstract
Although triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG) have been explored as a promising candidate for applications in multifunctional intelligent systems, the realization of highly efficient TENG that synchronously possess reasonable light transparency, high near&#8208;infrared reflectivity against solar heat gain, and good mechanical flexibility still remains challenging. Here, we present a reliable strategy that can substantially boost the performance and durability of indium tin oxide (ITO)&#8208;free transparent flexible TENG by surface modification via self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAM). Through the modification of Sb2O3/Ag/Sb2O3 electrode and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) dielectric layer with SAM of 12&#8208;(dodecylphosphonic acid) triethyl ammonium bromide and perfluorinated molecules, respectively, triboelectric charge generation is facilitated due to relatively large work function (WF) difference between the tribolayers. The resulting flexible TENG not only afford record&#8208;breaking power density (27.28&#160;W/m2) for ITO&#8208;free transparent flexible TENG, but also possess high durability against 5,000 cycles of bending owing to good adhesion at the SAM/substrate interfaces and high robustness of electrode. More encouragingly, the use of Sb2O3/Ag/Sb2O3 electrode endows TENG with both reasonable light transparency and high near&#8208;infrared reflectivity, which is beneficial against heat gain from solar radiation. This work showcases a promising route towards realizing transparent flexible TENG with high performance and durability, which represents a new platform for the design of next&#8208;generation wearable electronics.

         <title>Chemical Valence of Metal Impurity in Single&#8208;Wall Carbon Nanotubes Dominate Their Cytotoxicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synchrotron radiation&#8208;based analytical techniques are applied to characterize chemical species of metal impurities in single&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and to map intracellular accumulation of SWCNTs. The SWCNTs containing higher amounts of metal impurities such as Fe0 and Co0 are found to generate higher hydroxyl radicals and induce stronger cytotoxicity. Therefore, chemical valence rather than the quantity of metal impurities in SWCNTs dominates cytotoxicity.









Abstract
Metal impurities are believed to play a role in carbon nanotube (CNT) toxicity, however, redox properties of metal impurities can vary remarkably. It thus becomes necessary to investigate whether altered chemical valence of metal impurities in CNTs elicits diverse cytotoxicity effects. Studies on this issue are scarce partly due to the technical challenges of characterizing the chemical valence of metal impurities. Herein, synchrotron radiation&#8208;based technology was applied to qualify and quantify the chemical species and valence of metal impurities in two single wall CNTs and to in situ map intracellular metal distribution after CNT exposure. Surprisingly, the CNT containing a much lower amount of metal displayed significantly higher cytotoxicity compared with the higher metal one. Further analysis indicated that the CNT with lower metal content possessed higher amounts of zero&#8208;valent iron (Fe0) and cobalt (Co0). Results from electron spin resonance spectroscopy further confirmed that CNT with lower metal content generated more hydroxyl radicals, which was attributed to the high amounts of Fe0 and Co0. Taken together, our findings with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art synchrotron radiation techniques demonstrated that chemical valence rather than the quantity of metal impurities in CNTs determine their cytotoxicity, thereby revealing a novel aspect of the cytotoxicity mechanism of CNTs.

A facile synthesis of unsymmetrical 1,1&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted ferrocene derivatives based on the desymmetrization of 1,1&#8217;&#8208;diborylferrocene was developed. Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling (SMCC) reaction of 1,1&#8217;&#8208;diborylferrocene afforded mono&#8208;substituted products without significant loss of the second boryl group, and the subsequent second SMCC reaction afforded the desired unsymmetrical 1,1&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted ferrocene derivatives. This method provides a versatile synthetic platform for tuning the electronic and steric properties of functional ferrocene derivatives.








Abstract
Unsymmetrical 1,1&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted ferrocene is a versatile scaffold for various functional molecules, including organic electronics, catalysts, and bioactive molecules. Herein, we report a facile synthesis of unsymmetrical 1,1&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted ferrocene derivatives based on the desymmetrization of 1,1&#8217;&#8208;diborylferrocene. We found that Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling (SMCC) reaction using 1,1&#8217;&#8208;bis(Bpin)ferrocene affords the mono&#8208;substituted product without significant loss of the second boryl group. Then, second SMCC reaction of the obtained 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8217;&#8208;(Bpin)ferrocene affords the desired unsymmetrical 1,1&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted ferrocene derivatives in reasonable yields. This method provides a versatile synthetic platform for tuning the electronic and steric properties of functional ferrocene derivatives and for the structural development of bioactive compounds.

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Directed Structure&#8208;Specific Carbon Nanothreads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon nanothread (CNTh) is a family of 1D diamond&#8208;like materials, which was predicted to have extremely high strength, stiffness, and tenacity, but suffered from its disordered intrathread bonding. By a nonsymmetric F&#8208;substitution on benzene, we synthesized atom&#8208;scale ordered CNTh with specific structure out of many isomeric competitors. Our work paved the way to the precise construction of diamond&#8208;like material.








Abstract
Carbon nanothread (CNTh) is a sp3&#8208;bonded one&#8208;dimensional nanomaterial that was predicted to combine the extreme strength with excellent flexibility. However, the reported CNTh usually has a nonuniform intrathread structure, and the synthesis of structure&#8208;specific CNTh is still a big challenge. Here, we selected 1,2,3&#8208;trifluorobenzene (1,2,3&#8208;TFB) with strong dipole as a precursor. By compressing 1,2,3&#8208;TFB to 20.1&#160;GPa, a CNTh with a &#8220;zipper polymer&#8221; structure is obtained. Under applied pressure, 1,2,3&#8208;TFB are anti&#8208;parallelly stacked in column, and polymerize via selective sequential [4&#160;+&#160;2] polymerization between H&#8208;carbon dienophile/F&#8208;carbon dienophile and F, H&#8208;carbon diene within the column, followed by the &#8220;zippered&#8221; bonding of the rest atoms. The obtained CNTh is highly hydrophobic with contact angle of 124.6&#176;. The excellent columnar anti&#8208;parallel &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; stacking and distinct reactivities of carbon atoms introduced by the F&#8208;substitution are responsible for the high reaction selectivity, which provides new insight for the precise synthesis of atom&#8208;level ordered CNThs.

         <title>Fine&#8208;tuning the Photochemistry of Sulfur&#8208;Based Linkages with Ruthenium(II) Polypyridyl Complexes for Optimal PACT Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemistry of thioether&#8208;and sulfoxide&#8208;based Ru&#8208;S&#8208;linkages in ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complexes was studied for fine&#8208;tuning their application in PACT. The higher photocytotoxicity of thioether&#8208;Ru(II) polypyridyls was correlated to the facile photorelease of thioethers compared to sulfoxide ligands.








Abstract
The thioether&#8208;based monodentate ligands are reported to be efficient photoreleasable groups from Ru(II)&#8208;photocages designed for photoactivated chemotherapy (PACT). However, the direct comparison and systematic studies of the photochemical behavior of sulfur linkages of varied electronic/oxidation states, i.e., sulfoxides, thioethers, or thiols coordinated with Ru(II)&#8208;polypyridyls, remain unexplored. To delve into the intricate photochemistry of Ru(II)&#8208;S linkages, two Ru(II)&#8208;polypyridyls: [Ru(ttpy)(phen)(DMSO)](PF6)2 [1](PF6)2 and [Ru(ttpy)(phen)(DAS)](PF6)2 [2](PF6)2, [ttpy&#160;=&#160;4&#8242;&#8208;tolyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8243;&#8208;terpyridine, phen&#160;=&#160;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, DAS&#160;=&#160;diallyl sulfide, DMSO&#160;=&#160;dimethyl sulfoxide] were synthesized. Here, we used DMSO for the typical sulfoxide linkage, while DAS a biologically potent phytochemical, probed as a thioether linkage with Ru(II). The photosolvolysis monitored by UV/Vis and 1H NMR studies with white LED in CH3CN indicated more facile substitution of DAS than that of DMSO. The water&#8208;soluble [1](NO3)2 and [2](NO3)2 exhibited facile photorelease of DAS than DMSO from {Ru(ttpy)(phen)}2+&#8208;photocages in water. The cytotoxicity and photocytotoxicity studies with HeLa and Caco2 cells showed that [2](PF6)2 and [2](NO3)2 were more photocytotoxic with higher photoindices (PI) compared to [1](PF6)2 and [1](NO3)2. This apparently led to the conclusion that markedly facile photorelease of DAS resulted in higher photocytotoxicity of the DAS&#8208;based complexes. Therefore, thioether&#8208;based Ru(II)&#8208;polypyridyls portray better options for photocaging of prodrugs and PACT applications.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Ionic Liquid&#8208;Modified Resorcinol Formaldehyde Resins: Synthesis and Applications to Methylene Blue Removal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The order in the recipe matters! New semiconducting resorcinol&#8208;formaldehyde resins (RFs) have been synthesized using butyl&#8208;methylimidazolium methylcarbonate ionic liquid. Depending on the pre&#8208; or post&#8208;functionalization strategies, new materials present different benefits: dispersity control, variation of the band gap, and significant improvement the absorption properties toward methylene blue.








Abstract
Two new imidazolium&#8208;functionalized resorcinol&#8208;formaldehyde resins RFs were synthesized, using butyl&#8208;methyl imidazolium resorcinate [C1C4Im][Res] as a new precursor or using a post&#8208;functionalization method. During its synthesis, [C1C4Im][Res] spontenaously co&#8208;crystallizes with resorcinol (in a 1: 1 stoichiometry): the crystal structure shows H&#8208;bonds between resorcinol and resorcinate, and rarely observed &#960;+&#8211;&#960;&#8722; and C&#8211;H &#8211; &#960; interactions between the imidazolium ring and resorcinate. New RFs presented substantial decreases of the band gap compared to unmodified RF (2.0&#8211;1.72 eV). The use of [C1C4Im][Res] significantly improves particle size uniformity compared to unmodified RF, whereas the post&#8208;functionalization method partially degrades their structure. As RF, the two new resins efficiently catalyze the photodegradation of the methylene blue cation, and the post&#8208;functionalized resin has excellent adsorption properties for this&#160;dye.

         <title>Ca2+ Stabilized by Carborate Anions: Synthesis, Structure and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The syntheses of calcium carborates, Ca[HexCB11Cl11]2, 1, Ca[HCB11Cl11]2, 2, and Ca[MeCB11Cl11]2&#183;2(o&#8208;DFB), 3&#183;2(o&#8208;DFB), (o&#8208;DFB = 1,2&#8208;difluorobenzene) including the structure of 2&#183;4(o&#8208;DFB) are described. The large size of the Ca2+ cation is reflected by the coordination geometry with the Ca center being coordinated by three Cl donors from each of the carborate anions and one F donor from each of the two coordinated solvent molecules. Based on 11B NMR and DOSY NMR studies the salts 1, 2 and 2&#183;2(o&#8208;DFB) form close ion pairs in PhBr and o&#8208;DFB solutions. The Fluoride Ion Affinities (FIA) in PhBr for the salts 1 and 2&#183;2(o&#8208;DFB) were DFT&#8208;calculated (&#969;B97XD/6&#8211;31 + G**) at 211.3 kJ mol&#8208;1 and 217.5 kJ mol&#8208;1, respectively, which is below that of the landmark Lewis acid B(C6F5)3 (241.5 kJ mol&#8208;1). The Ca2+ center in salt 1 is sufficiently Lewis acidic to coordinate 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene (1,5&#8208;COD) and 2,6&#8208;octadiyne and to catalyze the hydrosilylation of 1&#8208;hexene and several alkynes, albeit slowly. Compound 1 also displays moderate activity as catalyst for transfer hydrogenation catalysis and carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis, a first for Ca compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitrile Hydroboration by Cooperative Iron Catalysis: An Experimental and Computational Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reductive amination is a challenging reaction in catalysis that often gives poor yield and selectivity. We present an ironcatalyzed approach of synthesizing amines through reduction of nitriles through hydroboration with good yield under ambient conditions. Our detailed mechanistic study establishes the factors that influence the selectivity and turnover. The kinetics and mechanism of the iron&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration of benzonitrile to bis(boryl)benzylamine has been investigated by initial rates, temperature dependence, kinetic isotope effects and computational studies. In contrast to other iron&#8208;catalyzed nitrile hydroboration, this study reveals that B&#8211;H bond activation is not rate&#8208;determining. Moreover, the rate&#8208;determining step was revealed to be C&#8211;H bond reductive elimination with an equilibrium isotope effect in operation. Through this combined approached, an Fe(0)/(II) catalytic manifold proceeding via metal&#8208;ligand cooperativity has been determined.</dc:description>

         <title>Removal of Phaeocystis globosa from seawater via polyvinylpyrrolidone&#8208;modified pyrite activated persulfate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phaeocystis globosa (P. globosa) is a highly motile and toxic harmful algal bloom (HAB) species in marine environments. The outbreak of P. globosa poses severe threats to aquaculture and coastal nuclear power safety, and causes economic losses. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore novel algal removal technologies to control P. globosa blooms. Herein, polyvinylpyrrolidone modified pyrite (PVP&#8208;FeS2) was synthesized as a catalyst to activate persulfate (PS) for removing P. globosa in seawater. The introduction of PVP effectively modulated the morphology, particle size, and catalytic performance of FeS2. The results demonstrated that a system containing 0.3 g/L PVP&#8208;FeS2 and 0.8 mM PS achieved 95.9% removal efficiency of P. globosa within 4 h. The Fe and S species on the PVP&#8208;FeS2 surface played critical roles in activating PS to generate hydroxyl radicals (&#183;OH) for algal cell oxidation, and produce iron hydroxides to promote the flocculation of algal cells. In addition, the PVP&#8208;FeS2/PS system maintained the integrity of algal cells and avoid the release of large amounts of intracellular organic matter. More importantly, the PVP&#8208;FeS2/PS system can simultaneously remove multiple HABs from seawater, and is expected to be applied in the field of emergency mitigation of red tide events.</dc:description>

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Alkylation of Ketones Using Primary Alcohols: Unveiling the Role of Manganese&#8208;Salen Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones with primary alcohols has been systematically investigated using two distinct phosphine&#8208;free Manganese&#8208;complexes (Mn&#8208;ph and Mn&#8208;en) bearing tetradentate Salen ligands. Remarkably, the complex Mn&#8208;ph with aromatic imine bridge was found to be efficient in comparison to Mn&#8208;en, leading to excellent yield of &#945;&#8208;alkylated ketone with good selectivity under operationally convenient conditions. Interestingly, a wide range of aromatic, cyclic, and heterocyclic ketones are effectively alkylated under the optimized reaction conditions. Notably, the transformation proceeds via an environmentally benign and atom&#8208;efficient pathway, generating water as the sole byproduct. The control experiments reveal the involvement of dehydrogenation of alcohols and hydrogen autotransfer (HA) pathway. These findings highlight the potential of Mn(II)&#8208;salen complexes in catalytic HA processes, expanding their applications in sustainable C&#8722;C bond formation strategies.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Polyelectrolyte Film for Spontaneous Electricity Generation with Photoresponsive Output Signals and Intrinsic Recyclability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing recyclable polymeric films for spontaneous power generation with stimuli&#8208;responsive output signals is a significant step towards sustainable wearable sensors, fashion textiles, etc., which remains highly challenging. Herein, we developed polyelectrolyte films for moisture&#8208;sorption&#8208;based electricity generation with photoresponsive electrical output signals from supramolecular co&#8208;assembly of alkaline solutions of lipoic acid (LA) and hyaluronic acid (HA) with amphiphilic azobenzene dopant and ionic liquid via an evaporation&#8208;induced polymerization process. Due to the intrinsic hygroscopic property and layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer structure with water channels, the corresponding polyelectrolyte films can absorb ambient moisture to induce charged ions dissociation and ion flow in the water channels, enabling spontaneous electricity generation. The polyelectrolyte film (0.4 cm &#215; 1.5 cm) generated currents up to 11.8 nA at ambient conditions (21.6 &#176;C and 69% RH). Notably, an immediate increase of current signal was observed by exposure to UV light because of variations in molecular geometry and polarity of the azobenzene dopant between trans and cis isomers. Besides, the polyelectrolyte films were easily recycled by dissolving in water and subsequent re&#8208;evaporation. The results demonstrated a new and simple pathway for developing recyclable supramolecular materials featuring spontaneous electricity generation with photoresponsive output signals, providing attractive opportunities for future sustainable advanced materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulated &#946;&#8208;phase crystallization of strong and tough polypropylene through hyperbranched topology</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving both enhanced strength and improved toughness of polypropylene (PP) remains a significant challenge for industrial applications. The present study addresses this limitation by constructing a robust crystalline network through the strategic integration of hyperbranched topology. We demonstrate that a hyperbranched nucleating agent (HBPN) effectively induces high&#8208;content &#946;&#8208;crystal formation in PP, which organizes into an interconnected crystalline architecture. This &#946;&#8208;phase network significantly enhances the mechanical performance of PP, with tensile strength and notched impact strength increasing by 35.78 % (to 42.5 MPa) and 140 % (to 13.2 KJ/m&#178;), respectively, compared to pure PP. Mechanistic studies reveal that the synergy between strength and toughness originates from HBPN mediated &#946;&#8208;phase crystallization, which refines the morphology of spherulites and increases the degree of crystallinity. The hyperbranched topology of HBPN inhibits entangled PP chains and facilitates crystallization of PP chains. Thus, it contributes efficient stress redistribution by dissipating localized energy through multidirectional load transfer, while arresting crack advancement via microvoid&#8208;induced stress relaxation. This work demonstrates an effective conceptual approach to engineering high&#8208;performance PP, unlocking its potential for various value&#8208;added applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Diethenyl Sulfoximine (DESI) as an Irreversible Lysine&#8208;Targeting Warhead Enables the Design of Covalent Allosteric EGFR Inhibitor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Targeting lysine residues with covalent inhibitors is challenging due to their abundance in the proteome and the protonation of lysine's &#949;&#8208;amino group, which diminishes its reactivity. This study introduces diethenyl sulfoximine (DESI) as a novel bio&#8208;orthogonal aminophilic electrophile which can react with lysine via double conjugate addition to form a cyclic adduct. The second addition promotes the entire and efficient electrophilic attack by the &#949;&#8208;amino of lysine on the ethenyl groups. DESI exhibits superior aqueous stability, overcoming the hydrolysis issue encountered by most reported lysine&#8208;targeting covalent agents. Incorporation of DESI in the allosteric pocket binder EAI045 of oncoprotein epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) yields compound 4, which specifically reacts to the catalytic lysine (Lys745). Compound 4 showed potent inhibition of EGFR&#8208;driven cell proliferation with IC50 values of 0.789 &#181;M and 1.22 &#181;M in engineered BaF3&#8208;EGFRL858R/T790M/C797S and NCI&#8208;H1975 cells, respectively, overcoming EAI045's limitation of lack in cellular potency as a single agent. Tyrosine kinases panel profiling confirmed selectivity toward mutant EGFR while sparing the wild type with minimal off&#8208;targets. These findings highlight DESI's potential as a versatile strategy for targeting lysine residues irreversibly, offering solutions to overcome drug resistance in cancer therapy and advance next&#8208;generation precision medicines.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorinated trimers for enhancing the stability and solubility of organic small molecules without spectral shifts: Ultrastable ultraviolet absorbers for transparent polyimide films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of highly stable organic small molecules for optical applications is of growing interest. Multimerization of monomeric small molecules can enhance stability via increased &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, but it often reduces solubility and induces undesirable spectral shifts due to &#960;&#8208;extension. To overcome this trade&#8208;off, we report a trimeric small molecule (F&#8208;TPBT) derived from a model monomer (Tinuvin 327) using a 1,3,5&#8208;fluorinated phenyl linker. This design markedly improves thermal stability and solubility while minimizing changes in the optical absorption spectrum. F&#8208;TPBT shows superior thermal properties (5 wt% decomposition temperature = 427&#8239;&#176;C; weight loss after 1&#8239;h at 300&#8239;&#176;C = 0.32&#8239;wt%) and excellent solubility (5.3 wt% in dichloromethane; 6.4 wt% in N&#8208;methylpyrrolidone), with an absorption spectrum nearly identical to that of Tinuvin 327. These properties make F&#8208;TPBT a promising UV light absorber for transparent polyimide films, which require processing above 300&#8239;&#176;C and are widely used in flexible displays. Notably, F&#8208;TPBT&#8208;containing films retain their absorption properties even after 80&#8239;h of accelerated UV irradiation, demonstrating excellent photostability. This study presents a broadly applicable molecular design strategy for enhancing the stability and solubility of organic small molecules while avoiding significant spectral shifts.</dc:description>

         <title>Porous Co@NC Materials Obtained by Pyrolyzing Metal&#8208;Organic Framework&#8208;Supported Multinuclear Metal Clusters for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multinuclear metal clusters Co4O4 were employed as precursors to synthesize metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon materials (Co@NC). The resulting Co@NC with Co nanoparticles and single&#8208;atomic Co&#9472;N4 sites exhibits efficient electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance.








Abstract
The design and development of efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts have become a key challenge for fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries. As a cutting&#8208;edge field in electrocatalysis, single&#8208;atom catalysts have been widely used in ORR due to their maximum atomic utilization and tunable coordination environment. In this study, multinuclear metal clusters were selected as precursors to construct metal nanoparticles and single&#8208;atomic metal sites doped carbon materials for electrocatalytic ORR. Specifically, Co&#8208;based metal clusters Co4O4 were prepared as precursors and Zn&#8208;based zeolitic imidazolate frameworks ZIF&#8208;8 were selected as supports. The resulting metal Co&#8208;supported nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (Co@NC) materials were obtained by pyrolyzing ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;Co4O4 hybrids. Both Co nanoparticles and single&#8208;atomic Co&#8211;N4 sites were observed on porous NC supports. Porous structures were attributed to the departure of Zn and O at the high&#8208;temperature. Co@NC catalyst exhibits a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.86&#160;V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, vs. RHE) for the ORR measured in a 0.1&#160;M KOH solution. This work provides a new idea for constructing single&#8208;atomic catalysts for electrocatalysis using multinuclear metal clusters as active sites.

         <title>Understanding the SN2 Versus E2 Competition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We provide an intuitive framework rooted in quantitative molecular orbital theory to understand the factors that govern the competition between the SN2 and E2 reaction pathways. The guiding concepts are: characteristic distortivity, transition state acidity, intrinsic nucleophilicity, and apparent nucleophilicity.








Abstract
Bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN2) and base&#8208;induced elimination (E2) generally compete, and it is, therefore, essential to be in control of this competition in synthetic organic chemistry. Herein, we establish guiding principles based on quantitative molecular orbital (MO) theory and the activation strain model to understand and tune the competition between the SN2 and E2 reactions. We discuss the role of key factors, such as the nature of the Lewis base, leaving group, substrate structure, and the solvent. To this end, we introduce the concepts of characteristic distortivity, transition state acidity, intrinsic nucleophilicity, and apparent nucleophilicity.

     alt="Understanding the SN2 Versus E2 Competition"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We provide an intuitive framework rooted in quantitative molecular orbital theory to understand the factors that govern the competition between the S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 and E2 reaction pathways. The guiding concepts are: &lt;i&gt;characteristic distortivity&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;transition state acidity&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;intrinsic nucleophilicity&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;apparent nucleophilicity&lt;/i&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2) and base-induced elimination (E2) generally compete, and it is, therefore, essential to be in control of this competition in synthetic organic chemistry. Herein, we establish guiding principles based on quantitative molecular orbital (MO) theory and the activation strain model to understand and tune the competition between the S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 and E2 reactions. We discuss the role of key factors, such as the nature of the Lewis base, leaving group, substrate structure, and the solvent. To this end, we introduce the concepts of &lt;i&gt;characteristic distortivity&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;transition state acidity&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;intrinsic nucleophilicity&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;apparent nucleophilicity&lt;/i&gt;. These intuitive concepts equip chemists with conceptual tools to better understand and design reactions for organic synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Relaxing amid Three: Slow Magnetization Relaxation in Three&#8208;Coordinate Chromium(II) N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Some members of a family of three&#8208;coordinate S&#160;=&#160;2 CrII complexes bearing NHC and amido donors display field&#8208;induced slow magnetization relaxation. Magnetostructural correlations are drawn within this family, and comparisons are made with literature CrII SIMs.








Abstract
Three&#8208;coordinate, paramagnetic CrII complexes of type [Cr(amido)nBnm(NHC)], NHC&#160;=&#160;N, N&#8217;&#8208;bis&#8208;(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (IMes); N, N&#8217;&#8208;bis&#8208;(2,6&#8208;di&#8208;isopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazol(in)&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene, (S)IDiPP; N, N&#8217;&#8208;bis&#8208;(2,6&#8208;di&#8208;isopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazol&#8208;4&#8208;ylidene, (aIDiPP); amido&#160;=&#160;N(SiMe3)2, NH(DiPP); Bn&#160;=&#160;benzyl, n&#160;=&#160;2, m&#160;=&#160;0; n&#160;=&#160;1, m&#160;=&#160;1, were prepared by substitution or aminolysis and thermolysis methods from [Cr{N(SiMe3)2}2(THF)2] or [CrBn2((S)IDiPP)], respectively. Depending on the nature of the NHC and the amido ligands, different geometries at CrII (ranging from distorted trigonal planar, to extended Y&#8208;, compressed Y&#8208;, and distorted T&#8208;shaped) and conformations, were observed. HFEPR spectroscopy was employed to accurately determine spin Hamiltonian parameters, consisting of zero&#8208;field splitting (axial D and rhombic E components) and g&#8208;values,&#160;of five S&#160;=&#160;2 complexes exhibiting D and E/D in the range from &#8722;2.98 to &#8722;1.63&#160;cm&#8722;1 and 0.026&#160;&#8722;&#160;0.069, respectively. AC magnetometry established slow magnetization relaxation in three complexes, operating by Raman or combined Raman&#8208;Orbach processes. Ab initio calculations provided computed zfs&#160;values, in good agreement with those obtained by HFEPR. Magnetostructural comparisons are made within this three&#8208;coordinate CrII family, as well as with previously studied two&#8208; or four&#8208; coordinate CrII complexes.

         <title>Crystal Structure of Carbonic Acid (H2CO3) at&#160; Elevated Pressures from Single Crystal Diffraction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single crystals of carbonic acid (H2CO3) were synthesized in a laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cell at moderate pressures between 5&#8208;13 GPa by reacting H2O with CO2. Its monoclinic crystal structure (P21/n with Z = 4) has been obtained from synchrotron single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments at ~8 GPa. The positions of the hydrogen atoms have been determined from the experimental data. Density functional theory&#8208;based calculations in combination with experimental Raman spectroscopy confirmed the structural model derived from the diffraction data. This is the first single crystal structure solution of water&#8208;free carbonic acid, H2CO3. The structural model provided here differs from structural models reported earlier for lower pressures derived from neutron powder diffraction data.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioorthogonal Click&#8208;to&#8208;Release of Branched Pro&#8208;Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioorthogonal click&#8208;to&#8208;release prodrug activation strategies should be fast and high yielding. However, in strain&#8208;promoted alkene&#8208;azide click&#8208;to&#8208;release, a fast click&#8208;step translates to slow and inefficient drug release. To improve drug yield, branched dual&#8208;core scaffolds that increase drug release are reported. The dual&#8208;core consists of an exposed electron&#8208;deficient aryl azide (core&#8208;1) attached to an electron&#8208;rich self&#8208;immolating branched linker (core&#8208;2). Core&#8208;1, a tetrafluoroaryl azide with methyl&#8208;substitution at the benzylic carbon, facilitates a rapid click reaction with trans&#8208;cyclooctenes (TCOs). Core&#8208;2 had an N&#8208;methyl carbamate or ether linker and a 1,4/1,4&#8208; or 1,4/1,6&#8208;self&#8208;immolating scaffold. Various release rates of a fluorophore were observed across the series, with 1,4/1,6&#8208;self&#8208;immolating core&#8208;2, linked via the N&#8208;methyl carbamate, having sustained and enhanced fluorophore release. The second order rate constant for cycloaddition of this 1,4/1,6&#8208;self&#8208;immolating analogue and d&#8208;TCO is, to the best of our knowledge, the fastest to date (22.0 M&#8208;1 s&#8208;1). A persistent intermediate was observed, leading to a long, sustained release of fluorophore from the branched scaffold, though activation under acidic conditions (pH = 5.5) led to &#8776;15% higher fluorophore release compared to activation at pH 7.4. Therefore, combinations of core&#8208;1 and core&#8208;2 could improve future pre&#8208;targeted in vivo bioorthogonal click&#8208;to&#8208;release prodrug strategies, especially in the acidic tumour environment.</dc:description>

         <title>Machine Learning Interatomic Potential&#8208;Enabled Discovery of Chlorofullerenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chlorination is an effective method for stabilizing fullerenes with pentagon adjacencies, transforming reactive sp2 carbon sites into sp3 hybridization to release local strain and reorganize orbital and spin distributions. Yet, the immense variety of fullerene isomers and their diverse chlorination sites pose significant challenges for accurate structural prediction. This study introduces a DFT&#8208;accurate machine learning potential (MLP) for the C&#8208;Cl system, facilitating high&#8208;throughput screening of chlorinated fullerenes. The MLP precisely replicates a range of experimentally identified chlorofullerenes and establishes correlations between parent fullerenes and their chlorinated derivatives in terms of structural features and stability, offering theoretical insights into the formation principles of chlorofullerenes.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative annulation of 2&#8208;arylimidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines with maleimides, representing the first example of the regioselectivity reversal for this class of substrates. Notably, the transformation proceeds efficiently with a low catalyst loading (1.5 mol %). A plausible reaction mechanism is proposed, supported by control experiments and in situ HRMS analysis. Photophysical investigations of the annulated products reveal moderate to high quantum yields, highlighting their potential for optoelectronic applications. Furthermore, these molecules demonstrate promising sensitivity as picric acid&#8208;sensing probes.</dc:description>

Photophysical investigations of the annulated products reveal moderate to high quantum yields, highlighting their potential for optoelectronic applications. Furthermore, these molecules demonstrate promising sensitivity as picric acid-sensing probes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;Activated Molecules Targeting G&#8208;Quadruplex Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We shine a spotlight on the molecular recognition mechanisms and phototherapeutic potential of light&#8209;activated compounds targeting G&#8209;quadruplex nucleic acids, critically evaluating recent breakthroughs and charting the key challenges that must be overcome to drive this promising field forward.








Abstract
Phototherapies harness light's spatial and temporal precision to noninvasively modulate biomolecular interactions, providing a powerful platform for precision oncology. This approach is particularly effective in targeting disease&#8208;associated molecular structures such as G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s), noncanonical nucleic acid conformations found in oncogene promoters and telomeres. These unique structures can impede DNA polymerase progression along the duplex, triggering DNA damage that ultimately compromises genomic stability. Stabilizing G4s with tailored ligands is currently being explored as a promising anticancer strategy, as it may induce toxic DNA damage specifically in rapidly dividing cancer cells. Unlike conventional G4 ligands, which remain continuously active, newly developed light&#8208;responsive molecules incorporate an OFF&#8208;ON switching mechanism that allows for spatiotemporal control over G4 dynamics and phototherapeutic effects. This concept article reviews a diverse array of light&#8208;responsive molecular tools, including photosensitizers (PSs), photocages, photochemically transformed ligands, and photoswitches, that selectively modulate G4&#8208;interactive binding properties, thereby laying the foundation for a versatile photopharmacological platform. Additionally, the article highlights recent advancements in this rapidly evolving field and discusses the challenges that remain for clinical translation, underscoring the significant potential of G4&#8208;targeted phototherapies to shape next&#8208;generation cancer treatments.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Ligand Cooperativity via &#928;&#8211;&#928; Interactions Supporting Outer&#8208;Sphere Hydride Transfer</title>

         <dc:description>
A set of new Ru(II)&#8208;CNC pincer complexes with benzimidazolylidenes and their catalytic activity toward &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones using primary alcohols is reported. These complexes can operate via inner&#8208; and outer&#8208;sphere mechanisms for the alcohol dehydrogenation step; however, the outer&#8208;sphere path is favored for the subsequent steps. The outer&#8208;sphere hydride transfer is found to be supported by &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions as a new type of metal&#8211;ligand cooperativity.








Abstract
A set of phosphine&#8208;free Ru(II)&#8208;CNC pincer complexes with benzimidazolylidene&#8208;based CNC&#8208;ligands has been synthesized and characterized, which show excellent catalytic activity toward &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones using primary alcohols. DFT investigations revealed that these seemingly nonbifunctional complexes can operate via inner&#8208; and outer&#8208;sphere mechanisms for the alcohol dehydrogenation step; however, the outer&#8208;sphere path is favored for the subsequent steps. The outer&#8208;sphere path is found to be supported by &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction between the extended aromatic ring system of the benzimidazolylidene&#8208;based CNC&#8208;ligand and aromatic rings of the substrates in a new, unprecedented case of metal&#8211;ligand cooperativity.

         <title>Fine Tuning of the Redox&#8208;Active Diguanidine Ligand in Cationic Cobalt Complexes for Electronic Structure Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work we show that the redox chemistry of hexacoordinated cobalt complexes with redox&#8208;active diguanidine ligands could be tuned by modifying the diguanidine and/or the co&#8208;ligands. In this way, one&#8208;electron oxidation could be directed to be either ligand&#8208; or metal&#8208;centered, leading to high&#8208;spin CoII complexes with an oxidized, radical&#8208;monocationic diguanidine ligand (ligand&#8208;centered oxidation), or low&#8208;spin CoIII complexes with a reduced, neutral diguanidine ligand. Further fine tuning of the redox&#8208;active diguanidine ligand leads to a harmonization of the energies of both redox isomers. Consequently, ligand&#8208; as well as metal&#8208;centered one&#8208;electron oxidation is observed, resulting in a mixture of both redox isomers. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations confirm the energetic proximity of the two redox isomers in this bistable system. The results of this work contribute to the development of a directed approach toward the design of bistable cobalt&#8208;guanidine complexes and their possible applications in spin switching devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding Small Molecule Activation Promoted by Heavier Benzene 1,4&#8208;diides: Interplay Between Diradical Character and Aromaticity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intricate relationship between diradical character, aromaticity, and reactivity in annulated heavier Group 14 benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diides (see picture) has been investigated through Density Functional Theory and ab initio calculations. A direct correlation between reactivity and diradical character, both of which increase down Group 14, is found.








Abstract
The intricate relationship between diradical character, aromaticity, and reactivity in annulated heavier Group 14 benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diides, that is, [(ADC)E]2 (E&#160;=&#160;Si, Ge, Sn), based on an anionic dicarbene framework, (ADC&#160;=&#160;PhC{N(Ar)C}2: Ar&#160;=&#160;aryl), has been investigated through Density Functional Theory and ab initio calculations. The diradical character of both homo&#8208; [(ADC)E]2 and heteroleptic [(ADC)2EE'] systems (E &#8800; E') has been accurately computed, while the aromaticity of their corresponding closed&#8208;shell (CS) and open&#8208;shell (OS) singlet states has been evaluated using magnetic descriptors. Additionally, the key factors governing dihydrogen activation and cycloaddition with acetylene have been quantitatively analyzed in detail by applying the combination of the Activation Strain Model (ASM) of reactivity and Energy Decomposition Analysis (EDA) methods. The findings reveal a direct correlation between reactivity and diradical character, both of which increase down Group 14.

         <title>Effects of Fluorine Substitution on the Human Telomeric RNA G&#8208;Quadruplex Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2&#8242;&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;fluoroarabinoguanosine (2&#8242;F&#8208;araG) at specific positions in the human telomeric RNA sequence allows remarkable stabilization of the parallel&#8208;type G&#8208;quadruplex structure. The mechanism of this stabilization results from electrostatic interactions via pseudo hydrogen bonds, induced by the effect of fluorine substitution in local nucleoside.








Abstract
DNA G&#8208;quadruplex structures can adopt different topologies, whereas RNA G4 predominantly forms parallel&#8208;type structures. While previous studies have reported the stabilization of DNA G&#8208;quadruplex topologies using syn&#8208;favored nucleosides, stabilization of parallel&#8208;type RNA G&#8208;quadruplexes through chemical modification remains unachieved. Here, we demonstrate that substitution with 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;fluoroarabinoguanosine (2&#8242;F&#8208;araG) at specific positions in the human telomeric RNA sequence stabilizes the parallel&#8208;type G&#8208;quadruplex structure. This stabilization arises from electrostatic interactions via pseudo hydrogen bonds, induced by the 2&#8242;F&#8208;araG modification.

         <title>Rapid and Efficient Solid&#8208;State Mechanosynthesis of Bipyridine Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanochemistry reaction of more than 10 metallic precursors of Ru, Ir, Pt, Pd, Fe, and Co with 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine afford the target complexes in high yield, in a short reaction time with very low E&#8208;factor and excellent Effective Mass Yield (EMY) values respect to of conventional solvothermal synthesis.








Abstract
2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine is considered to be the most widely used chelating ligand and it has been extensively studied especially in the areas of coordination chemistry, medicine, materials, and catalysis. A mechanochemical reaction is a process that involves the application of mechanical energy and it provides a high yield in a shorter reaction time and eliminates the need for bulk solvents, typically request in solvothermal reaction.
Notwithstanding the importance of the synthesis of bipyridine&#8208;metal compounds for several decades and recent advancements in the mechanochemical synthesis the development of a mechanochemical protocol for the synthesis of metal complexes bearing bipyridine remains unexplored.
In this work, we extensively studied the mechanochemistry reaction of more than 10 metallic precursors of Ru, Ir, Pt, Pd, Fe, and Co with 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine in different stoichiometric ratio without utilization of bulk solvents, under ambient conditions and without air&#8208;sensitive procedures. A comparison of the yield, reaction time, temperature, frequency, green metrics (E&#8208;factor and the Effective Mass Yield (EMY)) of conventional solvothermal methodologies and mechanochemical synthesis clearly indicates that the mechanochemical approach is more sustainable and efficient. Mechanochemistry approach can be complementary to common solvothermal approach, and in the future, it will be required greater attention in the field of organometallic chemistry.

         <title>Efficient Photocatalytic Degradation of Methylene Blue from Aqueous Solution Using Hybrid Biomass&#8208;Derived Nanostructured Carbon&#8208;TiO2 Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Industrial dye usage results in substantial wastewater discharge, posing environmental and health hazards. Hence, developing efficient, sustainable, and cost&#8208;effective treatment technologies is crucial. Photocatalysis using TiO2 has emerged as a promising approach for dye degradation. This study explores the photocatalytic removal of methylene blue (MB), a model dye pollutant, using a composite of biomass&#8208;derived carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) and nanosized TiO2 under UV light. The CNPs were synthesized via one&#8208;step pyrolysis from waste coffee leaves, offering a sustainable carbon source. The resulting carbon nanospheres (CL&#8208;10) and the TiO2&#8208;CNP composite (PC@CL&#8208;10) were thoroughly characterized using advanced techniques. Incorporating carbon significantly reduces the band gap of TiO2 from ~3.2 eV to 2.91 eV, enhancing photocatalytic activity. Degradation studies under varying catalyst doses, dye concentrations, and pH levels demonstrate effective MB removal under UV irradiation. Photocatalytic experiments revealed up to 99% degradation of MB under UV light, while tests conducted in the dark showed negligible activity, confirming the light&#8208;dependent efficiency. Kinetic analysis indicated that intra&#8208;particle diffusion governs the dye degradation process. Moreover, recyclability tests over six&#8208;cycles showed consistent performance with minimal decline, highlighting the catalyst&#8217;s stability and reusability.</dc:description>

         <title>Acceptor&#8208;Adaptive Automated Glycosylation Optimization For Automated Glycan Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optimization of glycosylation temperatures is essential for automated solid phase glycan assembly. Constructing a reliable optimization system that mimics key reaction components is crucial for increasing the atom economy and the energy efficiency of the process. Although glycosyl acceptors play a pivotal role in glycosylation, evaluating their effect on glycosylation efficiency is nontrivial. While screening various glycosyl acceptors for optimization is impractical, compromising for simple alkyl acceptors produces results of dubious relevance. We demonstrate that optimization with a modified trans&#8208;4&#8208;aminocyclohexanol&#8208;based acceptor accurately reflects the optimal glycosylation temperature of several glycosyl acceptors, overcoming previous limitations. The contextual use of both n&#8208;alkyl and glycan&#8208;mimetic acceptors for automated optimization enabled translation of optimized glycosylation temperature to highly efficient solid phase synthesis of disaccharides.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;Valent Group 14 Species Supported by BICAAC: Isolation of a Germylone and a Digermanium Compound</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study deals with the syntheses, isolation, and characterization of tricoordinate bicyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (BICAAC) adducts with germylene and stannylene halides. Subsequent KC8 reduction of BICAAC&#8208;germylene adducts afforded a bent (BICAAC)2Ge(0) species and a BICAAC stabilized trans&#8208;bent (Ge&#9552;Ge) digermanium complex. The reactivity of BICAAC&#8208;SnX2 adducts were investigated toward complexation with Fe2(CO)9, which afforded the corresponding donor&#8208;acceptor (Sn&#8594;Fe) metal adducts.








Abstract
Herein, we have disclosed the successful isolation and spectroscopic characterization of a series of bicyclic (alkyl)(amino) carbene (Me/iPrBICAAC) complexes of GeCl2 and SnX2; [MeBICAAC&#8208;GeCl2 (1); iPrBICAAC&#8208;GeCl2 (2); MeBICAAC&#8208;SnX2 (X = Cl (3); X = Br, (4))]. The in&#8208;situ KC8 reduction of GeCl2&#183;dioxane in the presence of MeBICAAC led to the isolation of a zero&#8208;valent di&#8208;coordinated germylone [(MeBICAAC)2Ge] (5), whereas the reduction of adduct 2 afforded a trans&#8208;bent digermanium complex, [iPrBICAAC&#8594;Ge&#9552;Ge&#8592;iPrBICAAC] (6), having a Ge&#9552;Ge (2.3652(5) &#197;) double bond. Additionally, complexes 3 and 4 were reacted with diironnonacarbonyl Fe2(CO)9 to produce the corresponding Sn&#8594;Fe adducts 7 and 8, respectively. Further, attempts were made to convert the MeBICAAC&#8208;Sn adducts 3 and 4 to the corresponding tin&#8208;hydride complex, by treatment with LiBH4, however, in both the attempts, uncontrolled hydrogenation occurred to give the dihydrogented MeBICAAC complex, MeBICAAC(H2) (9). The solid&#8208;state structures of compounds 1&#8211;8 have also been elucidated using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction technique. Further, computational investigations were performed to explain the bonding situation in 3&#8211;8 that establishes the ylidone character of 5, and supports the formation of 7&#8211;8 via donation of the lone pair at Sn to the Fe center.

         <title>Titanium cis&#8208;DACH Salan Catalyst for the Efficient Epoxidation of Nonactivated Olefins with Hydrogen Peroxide&#8208;Terminal&#8208;Selective Epoxidation of Multiply Unsaturated Terpenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Terminal&#8208;selective epoxidation&#8211;catalytic, simple, and with H2O2 as oxidant. The titanium complex of a new type of salan ligand, accessible in one step from cis&#8208;DACH and 3&#8208;(pentafluorophenyl)salicylic aldehyde, is an efficient catalyst for the epoxidation of nonconjugated olefins with H2O2. Most importantly, the novel catalyst is highly regioselective for terminal double bond epoxidation when multiply unsaturated substrates are employed.








Abstract
We report a new generation of highly active and readily available homogeneous titanium catalysts for the epoxidation of nonactivated olefins with aqueous hydrogen peroxide. Key feature is the introduction of pentafluorophenyl substituents into a salan ligand derived from cis&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane (cis&#8208;DACH). Our novel salan ligand is accessible in one single step by reductive alkylation of cis&#8208;DACH with 3&#8208;(pentafluorophenyl)salicylic aldehyde. In situ complexation with Ti(OiPr)4 of the cis&#8208;DACH salan provides the titanium catalyst, which, in the presence of aqueous hydrogen peroxide, smoothly epoxidizes a broad spectrum of olefins with up to 95% yield at a catalyst loading of 0.5&#160;mol&#8208;% only. The achiral cis&#8208;DACH salan catalyst showed syn&#8208;selectivity (4.7:1) in the epoxidation of a chiral, racemic terminal allylic alcohol. This catalyst furthermore allows the regioselective (up to 49:1) epoxidation of the terminal double bond in multiply unsaturated terpenes such as myrcene, (S)&#8208;citronellene, and (R)&#8208;linalool. For the latter two substrates, syn/anti&#8208;selectivity of up to 9:1 was observed. Augmented syn/anti selectivity (up to 50:1 syn or 25:1 anti) can be induced in the epoxidation of the chiral substrates (S)&#8208;citronellene and (R)&#8208;linalool when the &#8220;matched&#8221; enantiomer of the chiral &#8220;Berkessel salalen ligand&#8221; is employed.

The titanium complex of a new type of salan ligand, accessible in one step from &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-DACH and 3-(pentafluorophenyl)salicylic aldehyde, is an efficient catalyst for the epoxidation of nonconjugated olefins with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Most importantly, the novel catalyst is highly regioselective for terminal double bond epoxidation when multiply unsaturated substrates are employed.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report a new generation of highly active and readily available homogeneous titanium catalysts for the epoxidation of nonactivated olefins with aqueous hydrogen peroxide. Key feature is the introduction of pentafluorophenyl substituents into a &lt;i&gt;salan&lt;/i&gt; ligand derived from &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-1,2-diaminocyclohexane (&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-DACH). Our novel &lt;i&gt;salan&lt;/i&gt; ligand is accessible in one single step by reductive alkylation of &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-DACH with 3-(pentafluorophenyl)salicylic aldehyde. In situ complexation with Ti(O&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; of the &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-DACH salan provides the titanium catalyst, which, in the presence of aqueous hydrogen peroxide, smoothly epoxidizes a broad spectrum of olefins with up to 95% yield at a catalyst loading of 0.5&#160;mol-% only. The achiral &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-DACH salan catalyst showed &lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt;-selectivity (4.7:1) in the epoxidation of a chiral, racemic terminal allylic alcohol. This catalyst furthermore allows the regioselective (up to 49:1) epoxidation of the terminal double bond in multiply unsaturated terpenes such as myrcene, (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-citronellene, and (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-linalool. For the latter two substrates, &lt;i&gt;syn/anti&lt;/i&gt;-selectivity of up to 9:1 was observed. Augmented &lt;i&gt;syn/anti&lt;/i&gt; selectivity (up to 50:1 &lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt; or 25:1 &lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;) can be induced in the epoxidation of the chiral substrates (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-citronellene and (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-linalool when the &#8220;matched&#8221; enantiomer of the chiral &#8220;Berkessel &lt;i&gt;salalen&lt;/i&gt; ligand&#8221; is employed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pulsed Electrolysis Promotes CO2 Reduction on Tin Oxide Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study compared electrochemical CO2 reduction performance catalyzed by SnO2 under constant cathodic potential (Ec) and pulsed modes with periodic cathodic (Ec) and anodic (Ea) potentials. The latter strategy shows higher formate selectivity because pulsed electrolysis can regenerate active SnOx phase. This work enables the control of CO2 reduction selectivity by tuning the applied potential program.








Abstract
The performance of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is determined by multiple factors, including the optimization of catalysts and electrolyser, along with the electrolysis technique. Recently, pulsed electrolysis has been found to tailor the selectivity and prolong the stability of CO2RR on a variety of catalysts, with the most focus on Cu&#8208;based materials. The investigation of pulsed electrolysis on Sn&#8208;based materials remains at early stage. Herein, we evaluate the CO2 reduction selectivity of tin oxide electrocatalyst under constant potential electrolysis (CPE) and pulsed potential electrolysis (PPE). Tin oxide achieves higher selectivity toward formate under PPE conditions in comparison with CPE. Induced by applied potential, tin oxide catalyst undergoes obvious reconstruction and into the composite of Sn&#8208;SnO2 in the process of CO2 reduction under both PPE and CPE conditions. The high selectivity under PPE condition is ascribed to the formation of SnOx on the catalyst surface due to the applied anodic potential.

         <title>Accessing Single&#8208;Molecule Properties of Heptacene Using a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heptacene was synthesized within a MOF through in situ photochemical conversion of the precursor molecule. This approach accelerated the transformation reaction and suppressed the undesirable side reactions of heptacene via geometrical constraints. The bulk production of isolated heptacene molecules enabled the exploration of single&#8208;molecule properties, revealing the elusive electronic ground state of pristine heptacene.








Abstract
Acenes, classic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons composed of linearly fused benzene rings, represent a model system for exploring the physical properties of 1D &#960;&#8208;conjugated structures. Isolating individual molecules at the single&#8208;molecule level provides a means to investigate their intrinsic properties, which is typically done by dissolving in solutions. However, this approach becomes increasingly difficult to apply for higher acenes owing to their high insolubility and instability. Thus, the electronic structure of higher acenes has long been a subject of intense discussion. This paper introduces a method to encapsulate heptacene within a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) through in situ photochemical conversion of a precursor molecule. The transformation reaction of the precursor is significantly accelerated upon inclusion. This approach stabilizes otherwise unstable heptacene by suppressing undesirable side reactions through the spatial constraint. The bulk production of heptacene in an isolated state enables its exploration through various analytical techniques, providing insights into its single&#8208;molecule properties and leading to the first observation of its fluorescence. Moreover, experimental and theoretical studies reveal the electronic ground state of pristine heptacene.

         <title>A Dilute Hybrid Electrolyte with Trimethylolpropane Additive for High&#8208;Voltage Aqueous Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries Operated at Low Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous sodium&#8208;ion batteries (ASIBs) have attracted significant attention due to the advantages of high safety and low cost for energy storage devices. However, the narrow electrochemical stability window (ESW) of aqueous electrolytes and freezing at low temperatures limit practical applications. Herein, we broaden the ESW to 2.85 V and reduce the freezing point (below &#8208;80&#176;C) by using trimethylolpropane (TMP) additive to 1 M NaNO3 aqueous solution. Based on this hybrid electrolyte and equipped with a bimetallic Prussian blue analogue (NaCuHCF) cathode and 3, 4, 9, 10&#8208;perylenetetracarboxylic diimide (PTCDI) anode, the full cells display a specific capacity of 56.6 mAh g&#8208;1, 88% capacity retention after 800 cycles. Even at low temperatures of &#8208;20&#176;C, a specific capacity of 50.1 mAh g&#8208;1 after 500 cycles is also achieved. A series of spectral tests illustrate the interaction between TMP and water molecules which realizes the excellent electrochemical performances, especially at low temperature. This work provides a new strategy for the application of ASIBs in extreme weather and expands the practical application of aqueous batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Continuous Light&#8208;Induced Water Oxidation in Polyoxometalate&#8208;Based Photocatalytic Protocells and Prototissues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic protocells (Ru4PCVs) incorporating a Ru&#8208;based POM synzyme are constructed&#160;via&#160;the membranization of polymer/nucleotide coacervates. In the presence of a photosensitizer and a sacrificial electron acceptor, Ru4CVs are capable of continuously performing light&#8208;induced water oxidation at room temperature. Assembled into tissue&#8208;like sheets and spheroids, Ru4PCVs continue to perform light&#8208;induced water oxidation, showing enhanced activity and higher&#8208;order behaviours.








Abstract
The bottom&#8208;up construction of leaf&#8208;like materials capable of using visible light and water to produce oxygen and chemical energy is a major goal of artificial photosynthesis. In this work, we show that robust artificial cells (protocells) prepared by the membranization of polymer/nucleotide coacervate droplets with a bio&#8208;inspired Ru&#8208;based polyoxometalate (POM) catalytic oxygen&#8208;evolving center are capable of continuous light&#8208;assisted water oxidation at room temperature. We present a method to electrostatically assemble millions of the photocatalytic protocells into tissue&#8208;like protocellular sheets and spheroids and demonstrate that the protocellular assemblies exhibit enhanced rates of photocatalytic water oxidation compared with individual protocells. Our results highlight opportunities for synergistically integrating key aspects of photocatalysis, cytomimetics, and bottom&#8208;up engineering toward the development of modular photosynthetic active matter and applications in artificial photosynthesis and energy capture.

         <title>One&#8208;step Conversion of Bisphenol A Polycarbonate into Aliphatic Polycarbonate Polyols for Recyclable Polyurethane Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The growing accumulation of plastic waste emphasizes the pressing need for sustainable recycling technologies. In this study, we present a one&#8208;step conversion of bisphenol A based polycarbonate (BPA&#8208;PC) waste into aliphatic polycarbonate (APC) polyols using diols with varying chain lengths. The resulting APC polyols were subsequently utilized as soft segments in combination with 4,4&#8217;&#8208;methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) in the production of thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPUs). These TPUs exhibited excellent mechanical properties, with a maximum tensile strength of 58 MPa and elongation at break of 397%, as well as robust hydrolytic stability, maintaining performance even after prolonged water exposure. Notably, the APC&#8208;based TPUs exhibited excellent recyclability through organocatalytic depolymerization, which facilitated the simultaneous hydrolysis of both urethane and carbonate bonds.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The growing accumulation of plastic waste emphasizes the pressing need for sustainable recycling technologies. In this study, we present a one-step conversion of bisphenol A based polycarbonate (BPA-PC) waste into aliphatic polycarbonate (APC) polyols using diols with varying chain lengths. The resulting APC polyols were subsequently utilized as soft segments in combination with 4,4&#8217;-methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) in the production of thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPUs). These TPUs exhibited excellent mechanical properties, with a maximum tensile strength of 58 MPa and elongation at break of 397%, as well as robust hydrolytic stability, maintaining performance even after prolonged water exposure. Notably, the APC-based TPUs exhibited excellent recyclability through organocatalytic depolymerization, which facilitated the simultaneous hydrolysis of both urethane and carbonate bonds. This process yielded the selective formation of 4,4&#8242;-methylenedianiline (MDA), an industrial precursor to MDI, and 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BD) with remarkably high yields of 96% and 95%, respectively. This work provides valuable insights into designing closed-loop recyclable polymers by upcycling plastic waste via a straight-forward process. Additionally, it offers a practical and impactful solution for the end-of-life management of upcycled polyurethane products, thereby contributing to a circular plastic economy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemoenzymatic synthesis and&#160;in vitro&#160;selection of&#160;de novo&#160;thiazole&#8208;containing macrocyclic peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Backbone thiazole moieties prevail in bioactive peptidic natural products and play important roles in their biological functions. However, the de novo discovery of artificial thiazole&#8208;containing peptide ligands remains challenging. Here, we report an mRNA display&#8208;based selection platform for thiazole&#8208;containing macrocyclic peptides (ThzteMP), established through a dedicated posttranslational chemoenzymatic transformation. This method exploits the unique reactivity of ribosomally incorporated thioamides, enabling enzyme&#8208;free spontaneous heterocyclization to form thiazoline, which is further oxidized using the substrate&#8208;tolerant azoline dehydrogenase (GodE) to yield a thiazole moiety. By integrating this chemoenzymatic process with chloroacetyl&#8208;mediated thioether macrocyclization and mRNA display, we have successfully discovered thiazole&#8208;containing macrocyclic peptide ligands with high binding affinities against p&#8208;21 activated kinase 4 (PAK4). This study establishes a robust system to expedite ligand discovery of pseudo&#8208;natural peptides and to investigate the functional benefit of their backbone thiazoles.</dc:description>

         <title>An Aptamer&#8208;Conjugated AIEgen for Targeted Bioimaging and Photodynamic Therapy of Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has emerged as a promising noninvasive treatment for cancer and other diseases. Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) photosensitizers are excellent candidates for enhancing the efficacy of image&#8208;guided PDT due to their unique properties. DNA&#8208;modified AIE luminogens (AIEgens) offer an effective approach for nucleic acid detection and biospecies sensing, but their applications in tumor cell imaging and image&#8208;guided PDT have been rarely reported. Herein, we designed a light&#8208;up probe, named ApApt, for targeted imaging and image&#8208;guided PDT of cancer cells. The probe was prepared by conjugating AIEgen with aptamer and displayed specific targeting ability to EpCAM&#8208;positive cancer cells. ApApt exhibits good water solubility and shows very low emission in aqueous solution. However, it emits strong fluorescence as a result of the restricted intramolecular motion activation of AIEgens, which is triggered by the specific binding between the aptamer SYL3C and EpCAM protein. Upon delivery to cancer cells, ApApt efficiently generates ROS for targeted PDT under light irradiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Tuning in NHC Ligands: Synergistic Effects of BIAN  &#960; &#8208;Conjugation and Aryl  &#963; &#8208;Modulation in Gold(I) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we explore extended design of metal&#8211;NHC complexes that relies on dual strategies for tuning ligand properties: (i) electronic modulation through &#960;&#8208;extended frameworks such as bis(imino)acenaphthene (BIAN), and (ii) systematic aryl substitution to influence &#963;&#8208;donor strength and steric environment. We report the first integrated exploration of these two strategies on a unified ligand platform. A series of Au(I)/BIAN&#8211;NHCX complexes were synthesized by introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents (X = F, Cl, Br, CF&#8323;) at the ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208;, and para&#8208;positions of the N&#8208;aryl groups. This hybrid tuning approach allowed us to probe the synergistic and antagonistic effects arising from &#960;&#8211;&#963; interplay across multiple dimensions. Each complex was thoroughly characterized with respect to synthetic yield, structural features (including X&#8208;ray structure and dynamics in solution), photophysical properties (UV&#8208;Vis and luminescence), catalytic performance in hydroamination of phenylacetylene, and cytotoxicity in HEK293T cells. Structure&#8211;property correlations revealed distinct cooperative and counteractive regimes depending on the substituent type and position. These findings demonstrate that combining orthogonal electronic control elements enables a more predictive and fine&#8208;grained design of NHC&#8208;based metal complexes, with future implications for catalysis, materials science, and biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Oxidative Radical Polar Crossover Route to 1,4&#8208;Keto Carboxylates Mediated by Anchimeric Assistance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 1,4&#8208;keto carboxylate scaffold is present in the structure of many biologically relevant compounds. To date, there are only a branch of methods to prepare them, using either transition metal catalysts, or non&#8208;commercially available and sensitive starting materials. Herein, we describe a sustainable electrochemical methodology starting from commercially available and highly stable 1,3&#8208;diketones and alkenes to prepare 1,4&#8208;keto aryl and alkyl carboxylates in a highly efficient manner, without the need of an external catalyst or harsh reaction conditions. This electrochemical oxidative radical polar crossover transformation presents a broad scope, is compatible with many functional groups, and can even be applied in flow chemistry. In addition, the key stabilization of the intermediate carbocation by anchimeric assistance allows a high diastereo&#8208; and regio&#8208;control of the reaction. Moreover, the utility of these 1,4&#8208;keto carboxylates was demonstrated in several derivatizations and applications in the late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrophobic And Polarized Aromatic Residues Promote Internalization Of Arg&#8208;Rich Cell Penetrating Peptides Through Ionpair&#8208;&#960; Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) are small sequences that can cross cell membranes. Arg and Trp are highly prevalent amino&#8208;acids in natural and synthetic efficient CPP sequences. In particular, Trp is essential and cannot be substituted by other hydrophobic or aromatic amino&#8208;acids. The aim of the present study is to decipher the role of Trp in synthetic Arg/Trp CPP sequences. To do so, a small peptide library in which this residue was substituted by other natural or non&#8208;natural amino&#8208;acids was designed. Internalization of these peptides in cells was evaluated and it appeared that combining aromaticity and hydrophobicity in the presence of Arg residues leads to enhanced internalization. The study of the interaction of these peptides with model lipid membranes revealed that the modulation of hydrophobicity promoted insertion in bilayers, but had little impact on the binding affinity. On the other hand, more hydrophobic substitutes of Trp led to more favorable binding enthalpies to heparin. With DFT analysis, we suggest that ion&#8208;pair&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions between the aromatic ring and the ion pair formed by the positively charges Arg and the negatively charged cell surface groups can be established, and could be at the origin of the unique internalization properties of Trp&#8208;containing Arg&#8208;rich CPPs.</dc:description>

         <title>Small Molecule Donor/Polymer Acceptor Organic Solar Cells with Efficiency of 13.65% Enabled by Film Formation Kinetics and Phase Separation Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optimal donor&#8208;acceptor miscibility and face&#8208;on packing have been achieved with PY2S&#8208;F, which contains F&#8208;substituted end groups. The minimized phase separation leads to OSCs based on small molecular donors and polymer acceptors with a record PCE of 13.65% (JSC&#160;=&#160;20.73&#160;mA cm&#8315;2, FF&#160;=&#160;72.93%).








Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on small molecular donor and polymer acceptor (SD/PA&#8208;type) show low photovoltaic performance due to the unideal morphology. However, previous work mainly focused on the aspects of donors, but how the polymer acceptor influences its morphology and device performances is lacking in study. In this work, we apply three polymerized nonfullerene small molecules as acceptors, combining film&#8208;forming kinetics and microstructure characterization to investigate the efficient SD/PA&#8208;type OSCs requirements on polymers. We found the following two results: Strong miscibility between donor and acceptor would facilitate the acceptor inducing the donor to adopt a face&#8208;on packing; under similar miscibility, the inferior crystallinity of the acceptor facilitates a more proper phase separation. Hence, the DTBDT&#8208;C3&#8208;D6:PY2S&#8208;F&#8208;based SD/PA&#8208;type OSCs with the best miscibility achieve an impressive PCE of 13.65% with both high short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc) of 20.73&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and fill factor (FF) of 72.93%, which are among the highest values in the reported binary SD/PA&#8208;type OSCs so far. Our work provides a new perspective for the development of highly efficient SD/PA&#8208;type OSCs with polymer acceptor matched to small molecule donor.

&lt;p&gt;Optimal donor-acceptor miscibility and face-on packing have been achieved with PY2S-F, which contains F-substituted end groups. The minimized phase separation leads to OSCs based on small molecular donors and polymer acceptors with a record PCE of 13.65% (&lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on small molecular donor and polymer acceptor (S&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;/P&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;-type) show low photovoltaic performance due to the unideal morphology. However, previous work mainly focused on the aspects of donors, but how the polymer acceptor influences its morphology and device performances is lacking in study. In this work, we apply three polymerized nonfullerene small molecules as acceptors, combining film-forming kinetics and microstructure characterization to investigate the efficient S&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;/P&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;-type OSCs requirements on polymers. We found the following two results: Strong miscibility between donor and acceptor would facilitate the acceptor inducing the donor to adopt a face-on packing; under similar miscibility, the inferior crystallinity of the acceptor facilitates a more proper phase separation. Hence, the DTBDT-C3-D6:PY2S-F-based S&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;/P&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;-type OSCs with the best miscibility achieve an impressive PCE of 13.65% with both high short-circuit current density (&lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;sc) of 20.73&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and fill factor (FF) of 72.93%, which are among the highest values in the reported binary S&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;/P&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;-type OSCs so far. Our work provides a new perspective for the development of highly efficient S&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;/P&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;-type OSCs with polymer acceptor matched to small molecule donor.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Design and Synthesis of&#160;Bimetallic Cu(II) Compounds as Potent Antibacterial and Antibiofilm Agents with Metallo&#8208; &#946; &#8208;Lactamase Inhibitory Activityagainst Multidrug Resistant  Pseudomonas aeruginosa</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this research, a novel class of biologically active bimetallic Cu(II) compounds have been discovered as cutting&#8208;edge antibiofilm agents with metallo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactamase (MBL) inhibitory activity against the clinically isolated multidrug resistant (MDR) gram&#8208;negative bacterium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa&#8208;CI&#8208;1). Thus, the 2,6&#8208;bis[N&#8208;{N&#8208;(carboxymethyl)&#8208;N&#8208;(pyridylmethyl)amine}methyl]&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenol (H3L)&#8208;incorporated three bimetallic Cu(II) compounds, [Cu2L(H2O)(Cl)]&#8729;H2O (1), [Cu2L(H2O)(NO3)]&#8729;H2O (2) and [Cu2L(H2O)(CH3CO2)]&#8729;H2O (3) have been strategically designed and synthesized with unsymmetrical coordination arrangement that synergistically modifies the electronic environment of Cu centres for the enhancement of antibacterial and antibiofilm activity. The standard nitrocefin assay disclosed that 1&#8208;3 significantly inhibited the activity of MBLs produced by Pa&#8208;CI&#8208;1 at their 1/2 MIC doses. Molecular docking study revealed an excellent propensity of these Cu compounds for binding with different MBL&#8208;producing proteins.&#160;All three Cu(II) compounds displayed significantly high antibacterial and antibiofilm activity as established by multiple bioassays, including ex&#8208;vivo applicability studies. They showed an exceptional combinatorial activity when examined with commercially accessible five different &#946;&#8208;lactam&#8208;based antibiotics such as amoxicillin (AMX), chloramphenicol (CHL), cefotaxime (CTX), ceftriaxone (CTR) and Cefoxitin (CX) against Pa&#8208;CI&#8208;1. Our study disclosed that 1&#8208;3 could be the emergent drug leads and attract great attention to the inorganic, material&#160;and biological chemists, combating antimicrobial resistance.</dc:description>

         <title>Scandium&#8208;Catalyzed Highly Selective Deoxygenation of Alcohols by Using Hydrosilanes as Reductants</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we present a straightforward and efficient scandium&#8208;based catalytic system that enables highly selective reduction of &#963; bonds (C&#8211;O) in the presence of more reactive &#960; (C=O) or O&#8211;H bonds. Employing 5&#160;mol% of Sc(OTf)3 as the catalyst, a diverse range of aryl and alkyl hydrosilanes proved to be highly effective in reducing secondary and tertiary alcohols to the corresponding alkanes. Furthermore, this protocol was extended to the deoxygenation of ketones and the hydrodehalogenation of alkyl halides.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#160;Dispersion of Copper Nanoparticles on Carbon Black in Minimal Loadings Enhances the Electroreduction of CO2 to CO</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical CO&#8322; reduction (ECR) offers a promising route for converting CO&#8322; emissions into valuable chemicals. To enhance economic viability, the development of efficient and low&#8208;cost catalysts based on non&#8208;noble metals is crucial. This study focuses on copper (Cu) nanoparticles highly dispersed on a carbon black support, synthesized via a solvothermal method that allows for precise control over particle size and loading. We demonstrate that tuning these properties is essential to steer the selectivity of CO&#8322; reduction towards carbon monoxide (CO). Notably, a low catalyst loading of only 0.159 mg/cm&#178; was sufficient to achieve high performance. The optimized catalyst delivered a CO partial current density of 66 mA/cm&#178; (total current density of 100 mA/cm&#178; with 66% Faradaic efficiency for CO) at a cell voltage of 3.2 V. Furthermore, our results highlight the critical role of the gas diffusion layer (GDL), showing that its composition significantly impacts catalyst activity. This underscores the necessity of engineering advanced GDLs with tailored conductivity, stability, and hydrophobicity to further boost the performance of Cu&#8208;based catalysts in CO&#8322; electrolysis.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stability of pairwise tryptophan (Trp) edge&#8208;to&#8208;face aromatic interactions has been exploited in the design of small tryptophan zipper (Trpzip) peptides. Herein, we report a systematic study of the regiospecific impact of four constitutional isomers of non&#8208;natural fluoro&#8208;Trp, regarding their incorporation at either edge&#8208; or face&#8208;position. Single fluorine substituents withdraw electron density from the indole moiety and introduce a highly electronegative component while the native geometry of Trp is maintained. We employed a library approach based on the sequence of Trpzip2 and assessed peptide structure and stability using CD, FTIR, and NMR spectroscopy. Global hairpin stability was improved or compromised upon site&#8208;specific incorporation of a single monofluoro&#8208;Trp regioisomer. Fluorine substitution revealed key CH/&#960; interactions within the Trp/Trp packing and holds potential for the future optimization of aromatic interactions involving Trp.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;free Electrode Fabrication for Next&#8208;generation Batteries: Inception or an Endgame?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The challenges and opportunities of the emerging solvent&#8208;free electrode fabrication method are discussed in the conceptual review considering the aspects of environmental impact, cost of production, and the resultant energy density.








Abstract
Solvent&#8208;free electrode fabrication (SEF) is a revolutionary advancement in the field of battery manufacturing, providing a compelling, solvent&#8208;free alternative to conventional slurry&#8208;based processing. SEF offers significant benefits, including reduced energy consumption resulting from the elimination of toxic solvents, solvent recovery steps, a lower environmental impact, overall cost reduction, and overcoming of binder migration, encountered during the fabrication of thicker electrodes. However, the practical application of SEF must overcome key challenges, such as achieving uniform particle distribution, ensuring strong electrode cohesion and adhesion, and scaling up to meet industrial production demands. This review provides a comprehensive assessment of the current landscape in dry electrode fabrication technologies, featuring advanced techniques such as dry pressing, spray dry deposition, and 3D printing. The fundamental chemistry of materials in addition to the mechanical, and electrochemical factors critical for optimizing battery performance is elaborated with a clear focus on lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) from lab to manufacturing stage. Moreover, the article highlights significant recent advancements, identifies critical technical barriers, and outlines imperative research directions necessary to unleash the full potential of dry electrode manufacturing in the realm of sustainable energy storage.

         <title>The Low Oxidation State Paradigm is More Consistent with XFEL Observations of the S&#8323; &#8594; [S&#8324;] &#8594; S&#8320; Transition in Photosystem II</title>

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations within the LOS paradigm reproduce key XFEL observations of the S&#8323; &#8594; [S&#8324;] &#8594; S&#8320; transition in PSII. In contrast to the HOS model, the LOS framework explains both the disappearance of Ox during O&#8211;O bond formation and the unchanged Mn4&#8211;O5 distance in the peroxide intermediate.








Abstract
Photosynthetic water splitting catalyzed by the Mn4CaO5/6 cluster in the oxygen&#8208;evolving complex (OEC) of photosystem II (PSII) is crucial for sustaining the supply of oxygen on the Earth. A recent serial femtosecond X&#8208;ray crystallography (XFEL) study has provided unprecedented insights into the structural dynamics of the OEC during the S&#8323; &#8594; [S&#8324;] &#8594; S&#8320; transition, revealing that this process involves a peroxide intermediate formed via oxo&#8208;oxyl radical coupling between O5 and Ox. However, computational models based on the high oxidation state (HOS) paradigm have failed to explain key XFEL observations, including the apparent loss of Ox upon peroxide formation and the largely unchanged Mn4&#9472;O5 distance from S&#8324; to the peroxide intermediate. Here, we apply density functional theory to remodel the S4 &#8594; S0 transition within the low oxidation state (LOS) paradigm and show that this model yields results more consistent with the XFEL observations. Notably, this study demonstrates that the LOS paradigm can support the formation of an oxyl radical species essential for O&#9472;O coupling and subsequent O2 generation, a capability previously thought to be exclusive to the HOS model. Our findings offer an alternative explanation that complements existing models and broadens our understanding of the OEC mechanism.

         <title>Enhancing Proton Reaction Chemistry of Aqueous Zn&#9472;MnO2 Battery by Phosphate Proton Reservoir</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZPH as a proton reservoir enhances MnO&#8322; cathode performance in aqueous Zn&#9472;MnO&#8322; batteries. ZPH optimizes proton reaction chemistry, enabling high rate performance (219.2&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;&#185; at 3&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;&#185;), specific capacity (347.3&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;&#185; at 0.1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;&#185;), and cycling stability (1500 cycles at 2&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;&#185;). This scalable strategy improves proton&#8208;involved reaction dynamics for grid&#8208;scale energy storage.








Abstract
Aqueous rechargeable Zn&#9472;MnO&#8322; batteries have emerged as promising candidates for grid&#8208;scale energy storage due to their low cost, high safety, natural abundance, and high working potential. However, their widespread application is hindered by rapid capacity degradation and sluggish reaction kinetics. In this study, we introduce Zn&#8323;(PO&#8324;)&#8322; 4H&#8322;O (ZPH) as a proton reservoir to significantly enhance the electrochemical performance of MnO&#8322; by optimizing proton reaction chemistry. Specifically, ZPH stores protons during charging and releases them during discharging, creating a localized H&#8314;&#8208;rich environment that facilitates proton intercalation of Mn&#8308;&#8314;/Mn3&#8314; and the two&#8208;electron transfer reaction of Mn&#8308;+/Mn2&#8314;. Leveraging the proton storage capability of ZPH, the layered MnO&#8322; cathode demonstrates exceptional rate performance (219.2&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;&#185; at 3&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;&#185;), high specific capacity (347.3&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;&#185; at 0.1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;&#185;), and remarkable cycling performance (1500 cycles at 2&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;&#185;). This work provides a scalable and electrolyte&#8208;compatible pathway to optimize proton&#8208;involved reaction dynamics in aqueous Zn&#9472;MnO&#8322; batteries.

         <title>On the Importance of Balancing the pKa of the Additive in &#946;&#8208;Ketoenamine COF Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#946;&#8208;ketoenamine COFs are usually synthesized in the presence of acetic acid. Here, we report the surprising role of organobases TEA and DIPEA in achieving TpPa with high Brunauer&#8208;Emmett&#8208;Teller&#160;surface areas (&gt;1400 m2/g) and high crystallinity. The similar pKa values of TEA and DIPEA (10.8 and 11.0, resp.) and Tp (10.8) mark the importance of balancing the pKa for high&#8208;quality &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine COFs.








Abstract
Due to the irreversible tautomerization of imine linkages to their corresponding ketoenamines, &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) are a stable type of COF that displays high surface areas. In the solvothermal synthesis of such COFs, the use of (acetic) acid is ubiquitous. However, the effect of the added acid on the COF properties (notably their surface area) has never been investigated. Building on an extensive literature overview, we systematically studied the effect of the pKa of several added acids on COF performance characteristics and extended the investigation by including a series of (organo&#8208;)bases with varying pKa. Interestingly, the highest BET surface areas, above 1400 m2/g, were found in the alkaline region of the pKa window, with a maximum near pKa &#8764;10.8 for triethylamine (TEA) and N,N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA). Considering the pKa values related to the three phenolic hydroxyl groups of 2,4,6&#8208;triformylphloroglucinol, one of the COF building blocks, these organobases fully deprotonate two of these hydroxyl groups and partly deprotonate the third one, which optimizes the reaction rate of the &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine bond formation, explaining the improved COF crystallinity and associated microporosity. The largely overlooked use of organobases in the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked COFs thus offers a promising approach to improve the COF performance.

         <title>Electronic and Magnetic Properties of Ferrous Iron in a True Square&#8208;Planar Molecular Environment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin Hamiltonian parameters of an iron(II) phthalocyanine are obtained by pNMR, THz&#8208;EPR, and quantum chemical calculations. Large zero field splitting and the peculiar g&#8208;tensor pattern originate from mixing of the 3A2g ground state with two 3Eg&#8208;excited states of almost the same energy. This forms the basis for correlations between magnetism, structure, and reactivity of iron in this important coordination environment.








Abstract
The electronic and magnetic properties of ferrous iron in the iron(II)&#8208;2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24&#8208;octakis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenoxy)phthalocyanine (FePcOAr), exhibiting a true square&#8208;planar molecular environment, are investigated. Inhibition of intermolecular interactions by steric substituents allows detailed investigation of the electronic structure arising from the planar geometry of the d6 electron configuration. Complementary magnetometry, M&#246;ssbauer, FD&#8208;FT THz&#8208;EPR (frequency&#8208;domain Fourier&#8208;transform terahertz electron paramagnetic resonance) and pNMR (nuclear magnetic resonance of paramagnetic molecules) spectroscopies show that FePcOAr has an S&#160;=&#160;1 ground state with large positive axial zero&#8208;field splitting (ZFS) and a strongly anisotropic g&#8208;tensor, with two g&#8208;values much larger than the free electron g&#8208;value and one smaller. Correlation between the magnetic properties and the electronic structure is provided by high&#8208;level quantum chemical calculations. The calculations indicate a nearly triply degenerate ground level, in which spin&#8208;orbit coupling mixes the isolated 3A2g ground state with two excited 3Eg states, whose energy gaps to the ground state are almost identical. These findings provide valuable insights in the electronic structure of iron phthalocyanines and the long&#8208;standing discussion on their true electronic ground level, which has important implications for the application of this important class of complexes in catalysis and magnetic materials.

Complementary magnetometry, M&#246;ssbauer, FD-FT THz-EPR (frequency-domain Fourier-transform terahertz electron paramagnetic resonance) and pNMR (nuclear magnetic resonance of paramagnetic molecules) spectroscopies show that FePc&lt;sup&gt;OAr&lt;/sup&gt; has an &lt;i&gt;S&#160;&lt;/i&gt;=&#160;1 ground state with large positive axial zero-field splitting (ZFS) and a strongly anisotropic &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;-tensor, with two &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;-values much larger than the free electron &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;-value and one smaller. Correlation between the magnetic properties and the electronic structure is provided by high-level quantum chemical calculations. The calculations indicate a nearly triply degenerate ground level, in which spin-orbit coupling mixes the isolated &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt; ground state with two excited &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; states, whose energy gaps to the ground state are almost identical. These findings provide valuable insights in the electronic structure of iron phthalocyanines and the long-standing discussion on their true electronic ground level, which has important implications for the application of this important class of complexes in catalysis and magnetic materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structural Engineering of 1D Porphyrin&#8208;Crbazole Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a rational 1D COF design strategy through building&#8208;block engineering, revealing how structural topology and charge separation govern photocatalytic performance. Optimized H2Por&#8208;Ph&#8208;CZ achieves superior photocatalytic activity in both oxidative amine coupling and &#945;&#8208;bromoacetophenone dehalogenation via enhanced surface area and charge transfer efficiency.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with 1D architectures hold great potential for photocatalysis but face challenges in rational structural design and charge transfer optimization. Herein, we report a series of 1D porphyrin (Por)&#8208;carbazole (CZ)&#8208;based COFs (MPor&#8208;Phn&#8208;CZ; M&#160;=&#160;H2, Zn; n&#160;=&#160;0, 1) constructed via symmetry&#8208;guided Schiff&#8208;base condensation. The integration of a phenyl spacer (Ph) and metal&#8208;free Por knots in H2Por&#8208;Ph&#8208;CZ enabled an eclipsed AA stacking mode, yielding enhanced crystallinity, a high specific surface area, and optimal donor&#8211;acceptor interactions. Systematic optoelectronic characterization revealed that H2Por&#8208;Ph&#8208;CZ exhibited superior visible&#8208;light absorption, minimized charge recombination, and directional electron transfer from CZ donors to Por acceptors, as validated by DFT calculations. These attributes endowed H2Por&#8208;Ph&#8208;CZ with exceptional photocatalytic activity in both the oxidative coupling of amines and reductive dehalogenation of &#945;&#8208;bromoacetophenone derivatives, outperforming Zn&#8208;incorporated and spacer&#8208;free analogs. This work establishes a design paradigm for 1D COFs through synergistic topology control and electronic modulation, advancing their application in sustainable organic synthesis.

         <title>Valence Electron Dependent Contraction of P6 Ring in [(CpM)2(&#956;,&#951;6:&#951;6&#8208;P6)] (M&#160;&#9552;&#160;V, Mo): A DFT Study</title>

         <dc:description>
VEC dictates the reactivity and extent of NHC&#8208;induced ring contraction in triple&#8208;decker (TD) complexes: 28 VEC leads to the contraction of P6 to a P&#8325; ring, whereas 26 VEC results in further contraction to a P&#8324; middle deck, facilitated by outer&#8208;sphere electron transfer.








Abstract
The P6 ring in [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;,&#951;6:&#951;6&#8208;P6)] contracts to the P5 complex [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;,&#951;5:&#951;5&#8208;P5)][(MeNHC)2P] by MeNHC. In contrast, P6 ring in [(Cp*V)2(&#956;,&#951;6:&#951;6&#8208;P6)] contracts to P5 and P4 complexes [(Cp*V)2(&#956;,&#951;5:&#951;5&#8208;P5)][(MeNHC)2P] and [(Cp*V)2(&#956;,&#951;4:&#951;4&#8208;P4MeNHC)]. In addition, an anionic form of the precursor [(Cp*V)2(&#956;,&#951;6:&#951;6&#8208;P6)][(MeNHC)2P] is also produced here. Mechanistic investigation using TPSSh&#8208;d4/Def2&#8208;TZVP method shows the importance of different spin states in the reaction and a possible outer sphere electron transfer aiding the ring contraction of P5 to P4. Valence electron count (VEC) determines the variety of spin states accessible to the complexes and plays a decisive role in deciding the fate of the middle deck.

         <title>Supercritical CO2&#8208;Induced Ferromagnetism in 2D C3N4 for Catalysis in Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D ferromagnetic amorphous carbon nitride (a&#8208;C3N4) was successfully synthesized via supercritical CO2 treatment. The 2D ferromagnetic amorphous C3N4 substrate tuned the spin charge density of the loading Ru nanoparticles and accelerated the electrocatalytic HER kinetics.








Abstract
The exploration of highly efficient catalysts has been an essential challenge for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, 2D amorphous carbon nitride (a&#8208;C3N4) with obvious ferromagnetism was achieved through a typical supercritical CO2 (SC CO2) treatment process. The experimental results revealed the structural and chemical transformations during the formation of a&#8208;C3N4. Subsequently, a&#8208;C3N4 anchored with Ru nanoparticles (Ru/a&#8208;C3N4) was successfully synthesized and employed as a catalyst for the electrocatalytic HER, exhibiting a significantly enhanced catalytic performance compared to Ru nanoparticles anchored on 2D graphitized carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) without SC CO2 treatment. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further demonstrate that the ferromagnetic g&#8208;C3N4 substrate not only promotes disassociation of water molecules under alkaline conditions but also influences the charge distribution and modulates the free energy of H adsorption, finally accelerating the HER kinetics. These results impart significant insights into the electrocatalytic HER process and establish a foundation for the design of advanced catalysts with enhanced performance for energy conversion and storage applications.

         <title>Multifunctional Organelle&#8208;Targeting Probes for Intracellular Imaging and Enhanced Cancer Phototherapy</title>

Cy&#8208;NBD&#8208;5F was synthesized as a responsive photodynamic theranostic agent, featuring GSH&#8208;activated fluorescence signaling and enhanced Type&#8208;I&amp;II PDT for effective cancer treatment. After reacting with GSH, the active compound (Cy&#8208;OH&#8208;5F) successfully provides NIR emission and induces cancer cell death under light irradiation. In addition, the dual&#8208;organelle&#8208;targeting ability of this molecule could benefit the efficient therapeutic effects.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) represents a promising modality for cancer treatment; however, its clinical application is hindered by challenges such as glutathione (GSH)&#8208;mediated quenching of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and autofluorescence interference during visible light imaging. This study introduces Cy&#8208;NBD&#8208;5F, a photosensitizer engineered to address these limitations. Upon activation by GSH, Cy&#8208;NBD&#8208;5F exhibits 5.5&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement at 701&#160;nm, producing its reduced form, Cy&#8208;OH&#8208;5F, which demonstrates enhanced ROS generation, including a 1.4&#8208;fold increase in singlet oxygen and 1.2&#8208;fold increase in superoxide anion radicals. Under light irradiation, Cy&#8208;OH&#8208;5F induces significant cytotoxicity (IC50&#160;&lt;&#160;3 &#181;M). Additionally, the molecule predominantly localizes within lysosomes and the endoplasmic reticulum, showing organelle&#8208;specific effects to improve therapeutic efficacy. These findings show the potential of Cy&#8208;NBD&#8208;5F as a precise and effective tool for cancer theranostics.

Upon activation by GSH, &lt;b&gt;Cy-NBD-5F&lt;/b&gt; exhibits 5.5-fold fluorescence enhancement at 701&#160;nm, producing its reduced form, &lt;b&gt;Cy-OH-5F&lt;/b&gt;, which demonstrates enhanced ROS generation, including a 1.4-fold increase in singlet oxygen and 1.2-fold increase in superoxide anion radicals. Under light irradiation, &lt;b&gt;Cy-OH-5F&lt;/b&gt; induces significant cytotoxicity (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;&amp;lt;&#160;3 &#181;M). Additionally, the molecule predominantly localizes within lysosomes and the endoplasmic reticulum, showing organelle-specific effects to improve therapeutic efficacy. These findings show the potential of &lt;b&gt;Cy-NBD-5F&lt;/b&gt; as a precise and effective tool for cancer theranostics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Mediated Il&#8208;8 Binding to Heparan Sulfate Evaluated by Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy</title>

EIS demonstrates the effect of metal ion mediation of sulfation pattern and uronic acid stereochemistry&#8208;dependent IL&#8208;8 binding.








Abstract
Heparan sulfate (HS) interactions with interleukin 8 (IL&#8208;8) are crucial for immune system response. The structural features of the HS and the environmental entities, such as metal ions, can regulate these interactions. However, it is challenging to evaluate the effect of each parameter on the interactions because of low accessibility to well&#8208;defined saccharides and the lack of characteristic features to be determined by analytical tools. We evaluated the effect of the HS structural features on IL&#8208;8 binding affinity utilizing electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). We showed that the metal ions Ca2+ and Mg2+ dissimilarly mediate the interactions of HS and IL&#8208;8 in structure&#8208;dependent manner of the HS. We showed that in all glycans, a positive synergistic effect on IL&#8208;8 binding was observed. For several glycans, the presence of ions resulted in a dramatic increase in the affinity to IL&#8208;8, while for other glycans, a milder effect was observed. This demonstrated that both structural motifs and environmental features are crucial for maintaining the interactions between the HS and IL&#8208;8.

         <title>Accelerating or Slowing: Fine Tuning the De&#8208;Threading Kinetics of a T&#8208;Shaped Benzimidazolium Pumping Cassette</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of T&#8208;shaped benzimidazole&#8208;based dumbbell threads with variable stopper sizes, in combination with crown ether wheels, to elucidate the influence of structural parameters on [2]pseudorotaxane stability and de&#8208;threading kinetics. These findings establish key design principles for tailoring energy landscapes in benzimidazole&#8208;based molecular pumps.








Abstract
Artificial molecular machines (AMMs) rely on precise control of molecular motion, often enabled by mechanically interpenetrated architectures such as pseudorotaxanes. Here, we systematically investigated a library of [2]pseudorotaxanes formed by the combination of T&#8208;shaped benzimidazolium threads featuring variable stopper sizes and crown ether wheels (24C6, B24C6, and 23C6), to elucidate how structural parameters govern [2]pseudorotaxane stability and de&#8208;threading kinetics. Using ring&#8208;closing metathesis and subsequent hydrogenation, we synthesized 10 neutral [2]pseudorotaxanes in high yields (76&#8211;87%). Kinetic studies in DMSO&#8208;d&#8326; at 338&#160;K revealed that de&#8208;threading half&#8208;lives (t&#8321;/&#8322;) span five orders of magnitude, from 0.237&#160;hours (3a&#8315;, &#916;G&#8225; = 24.63&#160;kcal/mol) to 436&#160;hours (5c&#8315;, &#916;G&#8225; = 31.87&#160;kcal/mol). Notably, stopper enlargement and macrocycle rigidification (eg., via B24C6) significantly suppressed de&#8208;threading rates; 4d&#8315;, bearing a benzylic phenyl stopper and B24C6, showed a &#916;G&#8225; of 29.04&#160;kcal/mol and a t&#8321;/&#8322; of 168&#160;hours. Gas&#8208;phase modeling and NMR analyses further elucidated the roles of stopper geometry and host&#8211;guest interactions in modulating energy barriers. These findings provide design principles for the construction of pseudorotaxane&#8208;based modules, paving the way for programmable molecular pumps and advanced AMMs.

         <title>Zinc(II) Monomeric, Dimeric and Trimeric Photosensitizers with Microsecond&#8208;lived Intra&#8208;Ligand Charge Transfer Excited States Investigated through Time&#8208;resolved Optical and X&#8208;ray Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>ZnII photosensitizers relative to CuI complexes have received less attention due to their energetically&#8208;higher metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer states. Three ZnII complexes namely a Monomer, a bimetallic helicate and a trimetallic helicate, bearing phenanthroline ligands are hereby studied through time&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray absorption (tr&#8208;XAS) and femto&#8208;microsecond optical transient absorption spectroscopy (OTA). The formation of intraligand singlet charge transfer (IILCT) excited states is achieved within femtoseconds, followed by intersystem crossing (ISC) in nanoseconds to generate microsecond&#8208;lived triplet (3ILCT) states. Femtosecond OTA shows that the 1ILCT states in the Monomer, Dimer and Trimer occur within 235 fs, 683 fs and 730 fs, respectively, while &#160;nano&#8208;microsecond OTA and tr&#8208;XAS show their 3ILCT states &#160;to decay within 1.00 &#181;s, 1.48 &#181;s and 1.51 &#181;s. The ISC from the 1ILCT to the 3ILCT state for the Trimer is 42.8 ns compared to the Monomer and Dimer with ISC rates less than 13 ns. These differences arise due to the stabilization by &#960;&#8208;&#960; and CH&#8208;&#960; non&#8208;covalent interactions of the phenanthroline ligands. The dihedral and torsional angles indicate stronger ligand strains in the excited states of the Dimer and Trimer vs the Monomer. DFT calculations for the electrochemical oxidation potentials further highlight their capability in inducing&#160;photoredox processes.</dc:description>

         <title>The Ascent of Supramolecular Polymers and Gels in Asymmetric Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymers and gels, formed by the spontaneous assemblies of small molecules through various types of non&#8208;covalent interactions, are attractive materials for many applications. Their modularity also offers many opportunities in asymmetric catalysis, that have been tackled in the last two decades and more intensively in the last one. In this review, strategies adopted to develop efficient asymmetric catalysts supported on supramolecular polymers and gels are first categorized according to the chiral or achiral nature of the monomers used for their construction and second to their ability to be commuted into different states. Catalytic supramolecular polymers have been described for which enantioselectivity stems mostly from the molecular chirality located next to the reactive group, or at opposite ends of the spectrum, exclusively from the chiral environment provided by the supramolecular helices. New paradigms revealed by these systems include: (i) the organization of catalytic sites at the periphery of modular and well&#8208;structured one&#8208;dimensional assemblies, (ii) the possibility to conduct asymmetric reactions with a sub&#8208;catalytic amount of chiral inducers and even in absence of chiral monomers, and (iii) the development of a new class of switchable asymmetric catalysts.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactions of the monomeric C,N&#8208;chelated organogermanium(II) hydride L(H)Ge&#183;BH3 (1) with potassium alkoxides KOR provided potassium hydrido&#8208;alkoxo&#8208;germanato&#8208;borates {K(THF)2[BH3&#183;Ge(L)(H)(OR)]}2 (R = tBu (2), C(CH3)2CH2CH3 (3)) as products of KOR addition. Compounds 2 and 3 react with benzaldehyde under formation of alkyl esters of benzoic acid along with elimination of a neutral complex L(H)Ge&#183;BH3 (1).

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The reactions of the monomeric C,N-chelated organogermanium(II) hydride L(H)Ge&#183;BH3 (1) with potassium alkoxides KOR provided potassium hydrido-alkoxo-germanato-borates {K(THF)2[BH3&#183;Ge(L)(H)(OR)]}2 (R = tBu (2), C(CH3)2CH2CH3 (3)) as products of KOR addition. Compounds 2 and 3 react with benzaldehyde under formation of alkyl esters of benzoic acid along with elimination of a neutral complex L(H)Ge&#183;BH3 (1). Thus complex 1 was tested as a useful catalyst for esterification of aldehydes by KOtBu. The GC-MS analysis revealed formation of t-butyl esters of appropriated carboxylic acids. The mechanistic studies for the esterification of benzaldehyde with KOtBu catalysed by 1 were also performed either theoretically (DFT calculations), or experimentally (NMR and IR spectroscopy).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>On the Reaction of Pacman&#8208;Phosphanes with Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactions of Pacman phosphanes (1a) with Lewis acids such as R3B (R = C6H5, C6F5) and GaCl3 was investigated. While equilibria between mono&#8208; and di&#8208;adducts were found in the reaction with BPh3, B(C6F5)3 preferentially formed the di&#8208;adduct (1a&#183;2B(C6F5)3), which could be isolated and fully characterized. DFT calculations showed that the N&#8208;bonded adducts are thermodynamically more stable than the P&#8208;bonded adducts. In contrast to the reaction of the Pacman phosphane with boranes, GaCl3 reacted with 1a to give an unusual [Pacman&#8208;GaCl2]+[GaCl4]&#8211; salt, featuring a nearly planar GaN2C2 heterocycle as part of the Pacman macrocycle. In addition, the coordination geometry on one P atom changes from triple to an unusual quadruple coordination, although it is still a formal P atom in the +III oxidation state, as shown by quantum chemical calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>A supramolecular system of bioactive ionic liquid, peony extract, and peptide for enhanced permeability and synergistic skincare benefits</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The growing demand for safe and sustainable cosmetics has led to a marked inclination toward natural extracts and peptides as raw materials. In this study, we developed a sustainable system with multiple anti&#8208;aging effects by combining peony extract (PE) and acetyl hexapeptide&#8208;8 (AHP8) to simultaneously treat static and dynamic wrinkles, as well as skin dullness. As the poor skin permeability of AHP8 limited its efficacy, we used a bioactive ionic liquid derived from betaine and malic acid ([Bet][MA]) as a permeation enhancer. In vitro and in vivo zebrafish experiments indicated that [Bet][MA] not only significantly enhances transdermal and cellular penetration but also exerts synergistic anti&#8208;aging effects. While being biosafe, [Bet][MA] significantly increased the transdermal permeation, skin retention, and cellular uptake of AHP8. Theoretical calculations revealed that [Bet][MA] improved the anti&#8208;wrinkle and whitening efficacies of AHP8 and PE through supramolecular interactions; it modulated their electron cloud distribution and molecular polarity and thus intensified their affinity to target proteins in aqueous solutions. The supramolecular PE/AHP8/[Bet][MA] system demonstrated excellent radical&#8208; and reactive oxygen species&#8208;scavenging capability, collagen production, and tissue repair capability while concurrently inhibiting tyrosinase activity, motion signaling, and inflammation. The study findings pave the way for sustainable and multifunctional skincare solutions.</dc:description>

         <title>Coverage&#8208; and Temperature&#8208;Dependent Rates of Metalation, Ring Fusion and Polymerization of Benzoporphyrins on Cu(111)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using scanning&#8208;tunneling microscopy (STM), temperature&#8208;programmed desorption (TPD), X&#8208;ray photo&#173;electron spectroscopy (XPS) and density&#8208;functional theory (DFT), we have investigated metalation, ring fusion and polymerization of three different benzoporphyrins, tetraphenyl&#173;trans&#173;disbenzoporphyrin (2&#8208;Benzo), copper&#8208;tetraphenyltransdibenzo&#173;porphy&#173;rin (Cu 2&#8208;Benzo) and tetra&#173;phenyl&#173;&#173;tetra&#173;benzo&#173;porphyrin (4&#8208;Benzo), from 280 to 1000 K on Cu(111), and compare with previous data of tetraphenylporphyrin (0&#8208;Benzo) on Cu(111).
Using STM, we observe 2&#8208;Benzo to adsorb as individual, rather&#8208;immobile molecules at room tempe&#173;rature, which coalesce into elongated islands of metalated molecules at 373 K. N 1s XPS spectra confirm the metalation, and DFT&#8208;calculated structures and simulated STM images confirm the appearance in STM. Upon further heating to 398 K, the islands become rough and irregularly shaped, before completely dissolving at 423 K, most likely related to intramolecular ring fusion. Heating to 950 K leads to complete polymerization and a rough structure on the surface.
Using H2 TPD, we follow the coverage&#8208;dependent rates of metalation, ring fusion and polymerization for all four molecules. The metalation rate is found to correlate with, sometimes abrupt, changes in the adsorption structures, whereas the rates of ring fusion and polymerization decrease gradually with increasing coverage, for all molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamics of Ligand and Guest in 1D Hg(II)&#8208;Bispidine Coordination Polymers with Different Topologies Investigated by Solid&#8208;State NMR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1D coordination polymers (CPs) made of parallel, weakly interacting chains have been recently proposed for the selective adsorption of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), one of the main sources of air and water pollution. Since the efficiency of adsorption for VOC removal strongly depends on the specific and stable interactions between the volatile species and the CP framework, the characterization at the atomic level of host&#8208;guest interactions and guest dynamics is of particular interest. Here, low&#8208; and high&#8208;resolution solid&#8208;state NMR experiments were applied to acquire information on ligand and guest dynamics for two 1D CPs (1&#8208;ClBz and 2&#8208;ClBz), both containing a bispidine organic ligand, Hg(II) as metal center, and chlorobenzene trapped within the framework, but featuring different topologies. By combining analyses of on resonance 1H free induction decays, 1H and 13C longitudinal relaxation times, and 2H quadrupole echo spectra, it was found that chlorobenzene undergoes fast dynamics, mainly isotropic, in 1&#8208;ClBz, while it shows slower anisotropic motions in 2&#8208;ClBz, indicating stronger interactions between framework and adsorbate in the latter associated to the lower available free volume. Ligands are quite rigid for both CPs in the investigated frequency scale, apart from methyl groups, which undergo fast motions about their ternary symmetry axes.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorenyl Cations: Synthesis and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review covers the history of fluorenyl cations from Deno&#8217;s first report in 1954 on the parent fluorenyl cation to the present. The parent cation and most derivatives have only been observed as a fleeting species by mass spectrometry, UV/Vis spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, or NMR spectroscopy. The most common synthetic routes to fluorenyl cations are by dihydroxylation and halide abstraction of substituted fluorenyl precursors. Over the 71 year history, many advancements have been made with recent developments leading to isolable species including two characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction. The scope of this review covers the field of fluorenyl cations in addition to related species with different aromatic groups in place of benzene fused to the cycopentadienyl core.</dc:description>

         <title>Computational Study on the Relationship between Charge Localization and Second Hyperpolarizability in Mixed&#8208;Valence Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular systems with symmetric resonance structures with invertible polarization (SRIP) have been reported to exhibit negative second hyperpolarizability, which is unusual for ordinal molecular systems. We herein report that mixed&#8208;valance systems can also be recognized as SRIP systems showing negative second hyperpolarizability. Since electronic structures of MV systems are often represented by the Robin&#8211;Day classification, we theoretically investigated the correlation between the Robin&#8211;Day class and second hyperpolarizability &#947; in simple MV systems such as He2&#183;+ and biaryl derivatives. We found that the absolute value of &#947; increases and its sign reverses near the boundary of the Robin&#8211;Day class&#8208;III and II, where the charge begins to localize. The significant validation of &#947; was rationalized by the context of the intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) transitions, which are unique to MV systems. The calculated &#947; for MV systems is more than 100 times larger in absolute value than in the neutral state near the charge localization boundary, and the sign of &#947; switches at the class&#8208;II/III boundary. These results suggest that the nonlinear optical response of materials can be significantly switched by redox stimuli.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly, Aggregation Mechanisms, and Morphological Properties of Asymmetric Perylene Diimide&#8208;based Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability to control the self&#8208;assembly behavior of functional molecules offers pathways for optimizing their properties and structures for targeted applications. Asymmetric perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives, bearing similar oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) chains and increasing numbers of hydrophobic alkyl chains were used to investigate the effects of hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups on the properties of the resulting supramolecular polymers (SMPs). Tetrahydrofuran/water (THF/H2O) mixtures were found to be an optimal system to induce the self&#8208;assembly behavior of these asymmetric PDI derivatives; the behavior of these new systems was monitored by recording ultraviolet&#8208;visible (UV/Vis) spectra and analyzing changes in absorbance intensity. Temperature&#8208;dependent UV/Vis studies yielded thermodynamic parameters for the self&#8208;assembly processes and showed a transition from an isodesmic to a cooperative assembly mechanism with an increase in the number of hydrophobic alkyl chains. Detailed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) investigations revealed the formation of nanofiber&#8208;based supramolecular structures that exhibit a coiling tendency during their assembly process accompanied by the increase in the number (and total volume) of hydrophobic alkyl chains. Exploring these carefully tuned asymmetric PDI systems provides new opportunities to tune not only self&#8208;assembled structures, but also mechanisms of assembly.</dc:description>

         <title>Mono&#8208; IrIII&#160;versus heterobimetallic IrIII&#8208;AuI&#160;complexes for circularly polarized luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fundamental rationalization of the structural&#8211;circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity relationship is a challenging task. Herein, a pair of enantiopure, heterobimetallic IrIII&#8211;AuI&#160;complexes&#160;IrAu&#8208;4&#160;featuring chirality&#8208;at&#8208;metal is thoroughly investigated by means of spectroscopical and computational techniques, also including spin&#8208;orbital coupling (SOC) effects. Upon resolution of the racemic mixture of the starting chloro&#8208;bridged dimer via a chiral auxiliary ligand, the complexes IrIII&#8211;AuI&#160;are straightforwardly prepared in a stepwise procedure with retention of configuration in good yields. The&#160;IrAu&#8208;4&#160;complexes display moderate orange phosphorescence arising from an admixed metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand and ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MLCT/3LLCT) excited state and good chiroptical activity, as shown by both electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and CPL spectroscopy. A comparison between the parental mononuclear pairs&#160;&#916;&#8208;Ir(ppy)2(acac)&#160;and&#160;&#923;&#8208;Ir(ppy)2(acac)&#160;and the binuclear&#160;IrAu&#8208;4&#160;counterparts also provides interesting insights. The latter possess higher dissymmetry factor (glum) values despite the very similar ECD activity of the lower&#8208;lying&#160;1MLCT band with enantiospecific polarization bias of the light dictated by the chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal configuration. The different nature of the emissive excited state between the two families of complexes and its implication onto the radiative rate constant and the dipolar force is tentatively accounted for the increased CPL&#8208;activity observed in&#160;IrAu&#8208;4.</dc:description>

         <title>Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Insights into Direct Electron Transfer Between FDX1 and Elesclomol&#8208;Cu2+ complex in Cuproptosis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper&#8208;induced cell death, known as cuproptosis, is distinct from other forms of apoptosis. Previous studies have proposed Elesclomol (ES) as a potent cuproptosis inducer, with the mitochondrial ferredoxin protein FDX1 postulated as its primary target. However, the mechanistic details of electron transfer (ET) between Elesclomol&#8208;Cu2+ (ES&#8208;Cu2+) and FDX1 remain elusive, particularly lacking direct spectroscopic evidence. Here, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was employed to characterize the direct ET process between FDX1 and ES&#8208;Cu2+ complexes. Comprehensive low&#8208;temperature EPR measurements validated the efficient ET from reduced FDX1 (FDX1red) to oxidized ES&#8208;Cu2+ complex both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, ES&#8208;Cu2+ complex exhibited a greater propensity for accepting electrons from FDX1 compared to free copper ions (Cu2+), demonstrating the high efficiency of ES&#8208;Cu2+ as a primary electron scavenger for FDX1 in cells. In addition, EPR power saturation experiments and molecular docking analysis indicated that FDX1 has a much higher binding affinity for ES&#8208;Cu2+ than its homologue FDX2, providing crucial insights into the functional specificity between FDX1 and FDX2. This work advances our understanding of ET processes in cuproptosis and underscores the significant potential of EPR spectroscopy in the study of important redox events in cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Perspectives of Soft Lattice Halide Perovskite Photocatalysts, Mechanisms and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have shown significant promise in the realm of photocatalysis due to their distinctive optical and electrical properties. In this Perspective, we review the latest advancements in MHPs for photocatalysis, summarizing common modification methods aimed at enhancing photocatalytic efficiency and stability. We then highlight the changes in lattice and band structures exhibited by MHPs before and after photoexcitation, with a particular focus on the intricate and varied transformations observed in LFPMs. By emphasizing the importance of these lattice and band changes, we demonstrate how they can be leveraged to construct effective heterostructures and rationally design and synthesize novel perovskite materials with robust photocatalytic capabilities. We hope that this Perspective can offer researchers new insights into MHPs photocatalysis and advance the application of LFPMs in the field of photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Properties of an Aryloxenium Cation with a Triplet Electronic Ground State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryloxenium cations contain a formally positively&#8208;charged, monovalent oxygen atom with an incomplete electron shell. In spite of this unusual structural element, they are key intermediates in many important processes, such as biological oxidation reactions and the industrial generation of thermoplastics. However, the development of new applications is hindered by the lack of knowledge on their fundamental chemical properties. While most past studies have focused on aryloxenium cations with singlet electronic ground states, minor structural modifications can produce aryloxenium cations that have a triplet ground state. Unfortunately, examination of the reactivity of triplet aryloxenium cations is limited to just two studies that reported the detection of H atom abstraction from solvents. A detailed kinetic reactivity study involving cyclohexane, allyl iodide and dimethyl disulfide reagents is reported here for an aryloxenium cation with a triplet electronic ground state, the 2&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;pyridyloxenium cation.</dc:description>
