         <title>Standing on the Shoulders of Giants &#8211; Your Mentors and Role Models Will Shape Your Career</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our role models and mentors are very important in our personal and professional development. However, in most cases, we do not spend enough time or pay enough attention choosing them. Herein, I explain how to select our role models and mentors, what characteristics they should have, and how to get the most out of them. Finally, I comment on the advantages of volunteering in an international scientific organization where you will find people with similar interests with whom to grow with purpose.







Abstract
Choosing the right mentors and role models has a profound impact in both our lives and professional careers; however, most often, not enough time or thought is given to this important decision. Because of that, we may miss some great opportunities and limit the potential benefits. In this invited contribution, I share my personal experience on nurturing the relationship with mentors and on choosing role models with my same values and a strong sense of service.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Spectrum of the First Excited State of Au2+</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Au2+ cation: The high&#8208;resolution near&#8208;infrared spectrum of the lowest excited electronic state of this simple diatomic cation recorded by Ar&#8208;tagging photodissociation exhibits a surprisingly simple vibronic structure. Analysis by standard TD&#8208;DFT calculations provides the first spectroscopic information about the chemical bond in Au2+ in both the ground and excited electronic states.







Abstract
Au2+ is a simple but crucial model system for understanding the diverse catalytic activity of gold. While the Au2+ ground state (X2&#931;g+) is understood reasonably well from mass spectrometry and computations, no spectroscopic information is available for its first excited state (A2&#931;u+). Herein, we present the vibrationally resolved electronic spectrum of this state for cold Ar&#8208;tagged Au2+ cations. This exceptionally low&#8208;lying and well isolated A2&#931;(u)+&#8592;X2&#931;(g)+ transition occurs in the near&#8208;infrared range. The observed band origin (5738&#8197;cm&#8722;1, 1742.9&#8197;nm, 0.711&#8197;eV) and harmonic Au&#8722;Au and Au&#8722;Ar stretch frequencies (201 and 133&#8197;cm&#8722;1) agree surprisingly well with those predicted by standard time&#8208;dependent density functional theory calculations. The linearly bonded Ar tag has little impact on either the geometric or electronic structure of Au2+, because the Au2+&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ar bond (&#8764;0.4&#8197;eV) is much weaker than the Au&#8722;Au bond (&#8764;2&#8197;eV). As a result of 6&#8197;s&#8592;5d excitation of an electron from the antibonding &#963;u* orbital (HOMO&#8208;1) into the bonding &#963;g orbital (SOMO), the Au&#8722;Au bond contracts substantially (by 0.1&#160;&#197;).

         <title>Singlet&#8208;Oxygen&#8208;Induced Phospholipase A2 Inhibition: A Major Role for Interfacial Tryptophan Dioxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We showed that singlet oxygen produced from cold physical plasma efficiently inactivated the PLA2 enzyme. Experimental and computational analysis proved that the dioxidation of interfacial tryptophan residue to N&#8208;formylkynurenine led to the decay of appropriate interactions between the enzyme and phospholipid, which prevented the enzyme attachment to the membrane consequently inhibited the enzyme efficiently.







Abstract
Several studies have revealed that various diseases such as cancer have been associated with elevated phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity. Therefore, the regulation of PLA2 catalytic activity is undoubtedly vital. In this study, effective inactivation of PLA2 due to reactive species produced from cold physical plasma as a source to model oxidative stress is reported. We found singlet oxygen to be the most relevant active agent in PLA2 inhibition. A more detailed analysis of the plasma&#8208;treated PLA2 identified tryptophan 128 as a hot spot, rich in double oxidation. The significant dioxidation of this interfacial tryptophan resulted in an N&#8208;formylkynurenine product via the oxidative opening of the tryptophan indole ring. Molecular dynamics simulation indicated that the efficient interactions between the tryptophan residue and phospholipids are eliminated following tryptophan dioxidation. As interfacial tryptophan residues are predominantly involved in the attaching of membrane enzymes to the bilayers, tryptophan dioxidation and indole ring opening leads to the loss of essential interactions for enzyme binding and, consequently, enzyme inactivation.

A domino organocatalyst&#8208;mediated enantioselective Michael reaction and aldol condensation provided centrally chiral dihydronaphthalenes with excellent enantioselectivity, from which an enantiodivergent chirality conversion from central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality was achieved.

         <title>Diastereoselective Double C&#8208;H Functionalization of Chiral Ferrocenes with Heteroaromatics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diastereoselective double C&#8208;H heteroarylation of chiral ferrocenes provides valuable compounds with multiple functionalities using mild reaction conditions and simple reagents. Pd&#8208;Complexes with chiral mono&#8208;protected amino acids afforded corresponding heteroarylated ferrocenyl amines in good yields and high diastereomeric purities. In this way, a variety of indole, thiophene, pyrrole, or furan substituents were introduced to the ferrocene moiety. Furthermore, a range of relevant functional groups, e.g. ketone, ester, chloro, nitro, silyl, are tolerated by this method. An alternative combination of amino acid and ferrocenyl amine configurations was leveraged to provide the complementary diastereomeric products. The products of C&#8208;H heteroarylation can be transformed into corresponding phosphines. Absolute configurations of CH&#8208;activation products were confirmed by the combination of X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and CD spectroscopy.  19  F NMR kinetic study and DFT calculations provided insights into the reaction mechanism and reasons governing stereoinduction.</dc:description>

Furthermore, a range of relevant functional groups, e.g. ketone, ester, chloro, nitro, silyl, are tolerated by this method. An alternative combination of amino acid and ferrocenyl amine configurations was leveraged to provide the complementary diastereomeric products. The products of C-H heteroarylation can be transformed into corresponding phosphines. Absolute configurations of CH-activation products were confirmed by the combination of X-ray crystallographic analysis and CD spectroscopy.  19  F NMR kinetic study and DFT calculations provided insights into the reaction mechanism and reasons governing stereoinduction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanochromic Luminescence (MCL) of Purely Organic Two&#8208;Component Dyes: Wide&#8208;Range MCL over 300&#8197;nm and Two&#8208;Step MCL by Charge&#8208;Transfer Complexation</title>

         <dc:description>
Two components, two steps: Control over the mechanochromic luminescence (MCL) of a dibenzofuran&#8208;based bis(1&#8208;pyrenylmethyl)diamine was achieved using a two&#8208;component donor&#8208;acceptor approach. Wide&#8208;range MCL with a solid&#8208;state emission wavelength shift of 340&#8197;nm and two&#8208;step MCL that can respond to mechanical stimuli of different intensity were realized for two&#8208;component mixtures composed of this diamine and a variety of non&#8208;MCL acceptor dyes.







Abstract
Despite recent extensive studies on mechanochromic luminescence (MCL), rational control over the magnitude of the emission&#8208;wavelength shift in response to mechanical stimuli remains challenging. In the present study, a two&#8208;component donor&#8208;acceptor approach has been applied to create a variety of organic MCL composites that exhibit remarkable emission&#8208;wavelength switching. Dibenzofuran&#8208;based bis(1&#8208;pyrenylmethyl)diamine and typical organic fluorophores have been employed as donor and acceptor dyes, respectively. Outstanding wide&#8208;range MCL with an emission&#8208;wavelength shift of over 300&#8197;nm has been achieved by mixing the diamine with 3,4,9,10&#8208;perylenetetracarboxylic diimide. Unprecedented two&#8208;step MCL in response to mechanical stimuli of different intensity has also been realized for a two&#8208;component mixture with 9,10&#8208;anthraquinone. Fluorescence microscopy observations at the single&#8208;particle level revealed that the segregation and mixing of the two&#8208;component dyes contribute to the stimuli&#8208;responsive emission&#8208;color switching of the MCL composites.

         <title>The Coordinate Reaction Model: An Obstacle to Interpreting the Emergence of Chemical Complexity</title>

Accurate descriptions: Time&#8208;invariant (T1) models are the basis of the molecular description of modern organic chemistry. However, applied to open systems far from equilibrium, they may lead to erroneous interpretations. In such systems, stationary states must be described, in both their stability and evolution (generalized evolution criterion), through irreversibility (time variant, T&#8722;1) by macroscopic systems methods. Even ordinate, abscissa and curves, in reductionistic graphical descriptions; have different meanings.







Abstract
The way chemical transformations are described by models based on microscopic reversibility does not take into account the irreversibility of natural processes, and therefore, in complex chemical networks working in open systems, misunderstandings may arise about the origin and causes of the stability of non&#8208;equilibrium stationary states, and general constraints on evolution in systems that are far from equilibrium. In order to be correctly simulated and understood, the chemical behavior of complex systems requires time&#8208;dependent models, otherwise the irreversibility of natural phenomena is overlooked. Micro reversible models based on the reaction&#8208;coordinate model are time invariant and are therefore unable to explain the evolution of open dissipative systems. The important points necessary for improving the modeling and simulations of complex chemical systems are: a) understanding the physical potential related to the entropy production rate, which is in general an inexact differential of a state function, and b) the interpretation and application of the so&#8208;called general evolution criterion (GEC), which is the general thermodynamic constraint for the evolution of dissipative chemical systems.

         <title>Modulating the Enantiodiscrimination Features of Inherently Chiral Selectors by Molecular Design: A HPLC and Voltammetry Study Case with Atropisomeric 2,2&#8217;&#8208;Biindole&#8208;Based Monomers and Oligomer Films</title>

A series of inherently chiral electroactive selectors based on the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;biindole atropisomeric scaffold is studied in two enantiodiscrimination contests: as probes in enantioselective HPLC and as selectors in chiral voltammetry for successful discrimination of the enantiomers of chiral electroactive probes, either by conversion into enantiopure electroactive electrode surfaces or as chiral additive in achiral ionic liquid.







Abstract
A family of inherently chiral electroactive selectors based on the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;biindole atropisomeric scaffold, of easy synthesis and modulable functional properties, is studied in cascade in two enantioselection contexts. They are at first investigated as probes in enantioselective HPLC, studying molecular structure and temperature effects, and achieving very efficient semipreparative enantioseparation. The enantiomers thus obtained, of remarkable chiroptical features (optical rotation as well as circular dichroism), are successfully applied as selectors in chiral voltammetry in different media for discrimination of the enantiomers of chiral electroactive probes, either by conversion into enantiopure electroactive electrode surfaces by electrooligomerization on glassy carbon substrate (the two monomers with shorter alkyl chains), or as chiral additive in achiral ionic liquid (the monomer with longest alkyl chains). Discrimination is conveniently and reproducibly achieved in terms of significant potential differences for the two enantiomers, specularly inverting either probe or selector configuration. In one case successful discrimination is also observed with the two probe enantiomers concurrently present, either as racemate or with enantiomeric excesses, neatly accounted for by the peak current ratios.

         <title>The Role of Alkali Cation Intercalates on the Electrochemical Characteristics of Nb2CTX MXene for Energy Storage</title>

Different size cations from aqueous salt electrolyte intercalating into layered Nb2CTx electrode in supercapacitor were explored. The extent of interlayer expansion of electrode material varies with the size of the intercalation cations. Na+ ions showed the slowest permeation rate in the spacing between Nb2CTx layers compared to Li+ and K+.







Abstract
The intercalation of cations into layered&#8208;structure electrode materials has long been studied in depth for energy storage applications. In particular, Li+&#8208;, Na+&#8208;, and K+&#8208;based cation transport in energy storage devices such as batteries and electrochemical capacitors is closely related to the capacitance behavior. We have exploited different sizes of cations from aqueous salt electrolytes intercalating into a layered Nb2CTx electrode in a supercapacitor for the first time. As a result, we have demonstrated that capacitive performance was dependent on cation intercalation behavior. The interlayer spacing expansion of the electrode material can be observed in Li2SO4, Na2SO4, and K2SO4 electrolytes with d&#8208;spacing. Additionally, our results showed that the Nb2CTx electrode exhibited higher electrochemical performance in the presence of Li2SO4 than in that of Na2SO4 and K2SO4. This is partly because the smaller&#8208;sized Li+ transports quickly and intercalates between the layers of Nb2CTx easily. Poor ion transport in the Na2SO4 electrolyte limited the electrode capacitance and presented the lowest electrochemical performance, although the cation radius follows Li+&gt;Na+&gt;K+. Our experimental studies provide direct evidence for the intercalation mechanism of Li+, Na+, and K+ on the 2D layered Nb2CTx electrode, which provides a new path for exploring the relationship between intercalated cations and other MXene electrodes.

         <title>Ready Access to Anhydrous Anionic Lanthanide Acetates by Using Imidazolium Acetate Ionic Liquids as the Reaction Medium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 52, Page 13181-13189, September 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward pathway to synthesize anhydrous lanthanide acetate complexes from lanthanide chloride hydrates and the ionic liquid (IL) 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium acetate ([C2mim][OAc]) is described. The combination of the lanthanide size and the amount of IL introduced allows the selective formation of two isostructural crystalline anhydrous compounds the dimeric, [C2mim]2[Ln2(OAc)8], and the polymeric, [C2mim]n[{Ln2(OAc)7}n].







Abstract
Access to lanthanide acetate coordination compounds is challenged by the tendency of lanthanides to coordinate water and the plethora of acetate coordination modes. A straightforward, reproducible synthetic procedure by treating lanthanide chloride hydrates with defined ratios of the ionic liquid (IL) 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium acetate ([C2mim][OAc]) has been developed. This reaction pathway leads to two isostructural crystalline anhydrous coordination complexes, the polymeric [C2mim]n[{Ln2(OAc)7}n] and the dimeric [C2mim]2[Ln2(OAc)8], based on the ion size and the ratio of IL used. A reaction with an IL&#8201;:&#8201;Ln&#8208;salt ratio of 5&#8201;:&#8201;1, where Ln=Nd, Sm, and Gd, led exclusively to the polymer, whilst for the heaviest lanthanides (Dy&#8722;Lu) the dimer was observed. Reaction with Eu and Tb resulted in a mixture of both polymeric and dimeric forms. When the amount of IL and/or the size of the cation was increased, the reaction led to only the dimeric compound for all the lanthanide series. Crystallographic analyses of the resulting salts revealed three different types of metal&#8208;acetate coordination modes where &#951;2&#956;&#954;2 is the most represented in both structure types.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Sensitive and Ultra&#8208;Stretchable Strain Sensors Based on Emulsion Gels with Broad Operating Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 52, Page 13161-13171, September 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
High stretchability (more than 1000&#8201;%) and conductivity (0.67&#8197;S/m) emulsion gels were fabricated from emulsions and the introduction of glycerol endowed them with broad operating temperature (&#8722;20 to 90&#8201;&#176;C). The emulsion gel based strain sensors showed high sensitivity (gauge factor=6.240), fatigue resistance, self&#8208;healing and adhesion properties, realizing the repeatable and accurate detection of full&#8208;range human motions.







Abstract
Hydrogels with mechanical elasticity and conductivity are ideal materials in wearable devices. However, traditional hydrogels are fragile upon mechanical loading and lose functions in climate change because the internal water undergoes freeze and dehydration. Herein, we synthesize stable emulsions at high and low temperatures by introducing glycerol into the W/W emulsions. Then the high&#8208;stable emulsions are used as templates to produce the freestanding emulsion gels with enhanced mechanical strength and conductivity. The introduction of glycerol endows emulsions and emulsion gels with high and low temperature resistance (&#8722;20 to 90&#8201;&#176;C). The fabricated strain sensors based on emulsion gels show high sensitivity (gauge factor=6.240), high stretchability (1081&#8201;%), fatigue resistance, self&#8208;healing and adhesion properties, realizing the repeatable and accurate detection of various human motions. These high&#8208;performance and eco&#8208;friendly emulsion gels can be promising candidates for next&#8208;generation artificial skin and human&#8208;machine interface.

         <title>Fluorescent Molecular Logic Gates Driven by Temperature and by Protons in Solution and on Solid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 52, Page 13268-13274, September 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single family of compounds, 1,3,5&#8208;triaryl&#8208;&#916;2&#8208;pyrazolines, produces fluorescent logic gates in aqueous solution and on solid silica microparticles with H+ and temperature as inputs. H+&#8208;driven YES, PASS 1, YES+PASS 1, NOT, as well as temperature&#8208;driven NOT gates are demonstrated. H+&#8208;driven logic gates are based on photoinduced electron transfer (PET), whereas the temperature&#8208;driven cases depend on C(5)&#8722;N(1) predissociation. Temperature&#8208;driven YES logic gates based on polyacrylamide polymers alongside push&#8211;pull benzofurazans are also introduced for tagging solid particles.







Abstract
Temperature&#8208;driven fluorescent NOT logic is demonstrated by exploiting predissociation in a 1,3,5&#8208;trisubstituted &#916;2&#8208;pyrazoline on its own and when grafted onto silica microparticles. Related &#916;2&#8208;pyrazolines become proton&#8208;driven YES and NOT logic gates on the basis of fluorescent photoinduced electron transfer (PET) switches. Additional PASS 1 and YES+PASS 1 logic gates on silica are also demonstrated within the same family. Beside these small&#8208;molecule systems, a polymeric molecular thermometer based on a benzofurazan&#8208;derivatized N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide copolymer is attached to silica to produce temperature&#8208;driven fluorescent YES logic.

         <title>[Ni(NHC)2] as a Scaffold for Structurally Characterized trans [H&#8722;Ni&#8722;PR2] and trans [R2P&#8722;Ni&#8722;PR2] Complexes</title>

         <dc:description>
Whole lotta terminal phosphidos: A combined experimental and computational study of the reactivity of [Ni(NHC)2] (NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) towards secondary and primary phosphines has been undertaken. P&#8722;H bond activation, as well as P&#8722;P activation of diphosphines, yields an extensive series of structurally characterised terminal phosphido complexes that exhibit unusual trans&#8208;phosphido hydrido and novel trans&#8208;bis&#8208;phosphido geometries.







Abstract
The addition of PPh2H, PPhMeH, PPhH2, P(para&#8208;Tol)H2, PMesH2 and PH3 to the two&#8208;coordinate Ni0 N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene species [Ni(NHC)2] (NHC=IiPr2, IMe4, IEt2Me2) affords a series of mononuclear, terminal phosphido nickel complexes. Structural characterisation of nine of these compounds shows that they have unusual trans [H&#8722;Ni&#8722;PR2] or novel trans [R2P&#8722;Ni&#8722;PR2] geometries. The bis&#8208;phosphido complexes are more accessible when smaller NHCs (IMe4&gt;IEt2Me2&gt;IiPr2) and phosphines are employed. P&#8722;P activation of the diphosphines R2P&#8722;PR2 (R2=Ph2, PhMe) provides an alternative route to some of the [Ni(NHC)2(PR2)2] complexes. DFT calculations capture these trends with P&#8722;H bond activation proceeding from unconventional phosphine adducts in which the H substituent bridges the Ni&#8722;P bond. P&#8722;P bond activation from [Ni(NHC)2(Ph2P&#8722;PPh2)] adducts proceeds with computed barriers below 10&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. The ability of the [Ni(NHC)2] moiety to afford isolable terminal phosphido products reflects the stability of the Ni&#8722;NHC bond that prevents ligand dissociation and onward reaction.

Structural characterisation of nine of these compounds shows that they have unusual &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; [H&#8722;Ni&#8722;PR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] or novel &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; [R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&#8722;Ni&#8722;PR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] geometries. The bis-phosphido complexes are more accessible when smaller NHCs (IMe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;gt;IEt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;gt;I&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and phosphines are employed. P&#8722;P activation of the diphosphines R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&#8722;PR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, PhMe) provides an alternative route to some of the [Ni(NHC)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(PR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] complexes. DFT calculations capture these trends with P&#8722;H bond activation proceeding from unconventional phosphine adducts in which the H substituent bridges the Ni&#8722;P bond. P&#8722;P bond activation from [Ni(NHC)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&#8722;PPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)] adducts proceeds with computed barriers below 10&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The ability of the [Ni(NHC)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] moiety to afford isolable terminal phosphido products reflects the stability of the Ni&#8722;NHC bond that prevents ligand dissociation and onward reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The first comprehensive solid&#8208;state NMR characterization of geminal alane&#8208;phosphane frustrated Lewis pairs (Al/P FLPs) is reported. For measuring internuclear Al&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;P distances a new resonance&#8208;echo saturation&#8208;pulse double&#8208;resonance (RESPDOR) experiment was developed by using efficient saturation via frequency&#8208;swept wideband uniform rate smooth truncation (WURST) pulses.

Abstract
The first comprehensive solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) characterization of geminal alane&#8208;phosphane frustrated Lewis pairs (Al/P FLPs) is reported. Their relevant NMR parameters (isotropic chemical shifts, direct and indirect 27Al&#8208;31P spin&#8208;spin coupling constants, and 27Al nuclear electric quadrupole coupling tensor components) have been determined by numerical analysis of the experimental NMR line shapes and compared with values computed from the known crystal structures by using density functional theory (DFT) methods. Our work demonstrates that the 31P NMR chemical shifts for the studied Al/P FLPs are very sensitive to slight structural inequivalences. The 27Al NMR central transition signals are spread out over a broad frequency range (&gt;200&#8197;kHz), owing to the presence of strong nuclear electric quadrupolar interactions that can be well&#8208;reproduced by the static 27Al wideband uniform rate smooth truncation (WURST) Carr&#8208;Purcell&#8208;Meiboom&#8208;Gill (WCPMG) NMR experiment. 27Al chemical shifts and quadrupole tensor components offer a facile and clear distinction between three&#8208; and four&#8208;coordinate aluminum environments. For measuring internuclear Al&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;P distances a new resonance&#8208;echo saturation&#8208;pulse double&#8208;resonance (RESPDOR) experiment was developed by using efficient saturation via frequency&#8208;swept WURST pulses. The successful implementation of this widely applicable technique indicates that internuclear Al&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;P distances in these compounds can be measured within a precision of &#177;0.1&#8197;&#197;.

         <title>Non&#8208;conventional Behavior of a 2,1&#8208;Benzazaphosphole: Heterodiene or Hidden Phosphinidene?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 52, Page 13149-13160, September 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dualistic behavior of the titled 2,1&#8208;benzazaphosphole, behaving as a heterodiene versus a hidden phosphinidene, has been theoretically predicted based on an NTR analysis. This spectacular feature has been proven chemically as well. Thus, it is able to participate in hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reactions forming expected heterocycles, but it also serves as a 4e ligand, using two phosphorus electron lone pairs, bridging two transition metals (Au, Ag and Co).







Abstract
The titled 2,1&#8208;benzazaphosphole (1) (i.&#8201;e. ArP, where Ar=2&#8208;(DippN=CH)C6H4, Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) showed a spectacular reactivity behaving both as a reactive heterodiene in hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder (DA) reactions or as a hidden phosphinidene in the coordination toward selected transition metals (TMs). Thus, 1 reacts with electron&#8208;deficient alkynes RC&#8801;CR (R=CO2Me, C5F4N) giving 1&#8208;phospha&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;iminonaphthalenes 2 and 3, that undergo hydrogen migration producing 1&#8208;phosphanaphthalenes 4 and 5. Compound 1 is also able to activate the C=C double bond in selected N&#8208;alkyl/aryl&#8208;maleimides RN(C(O)CH)2 (R=Me, tBu, Ph) resulting in the addition products 7&#8211;9 with bridged bicyclic [2.2.1] structures. The binding of the maleimides to 1 is semi&#8208;reversible upon heating. By contrast, when 1 was treated with selected TM complexes, it serves as a 4e donor bridging two TMs thus producing complexes [&#956;&#8208;ArP(AuCl)2] (10), [(&#956;&#8208;ArP)4Ag4][X]4 (X=BF4 (11), OTf (12)) and [&#956;&#8208;ArP(Co2(CO)6)] (13). The structure and electron distribution of the starting material 1 as well as of other compounds were also studied from the theoretical point of view.

         <title>Hybrid Self&#8208;Assembled Gel Beads for Tuneable pH&#8208;Controlled Rosuvastatin Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 52, Page 13203-13210, September 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
It&#8242;s all in the delivery: Self&#8208;assembled gel beads have been fabricated using different supramolecular gelators in combination with a calcium alginate polymer gelator and loaded with the statin drug rosuvastatin. The rate of rosuvastatin release is shown to depend on both the pH of the receiving solution and the precise gel bead composition. As such, these gel beads are capable of doubly controlled release.







Abstract
This article describes the fabrication of new pH&#8208;responsive hybrid gel beads combining the polymer gelator calcium alginate with two different low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelators (LMWGs) based on 1,3&#8201;:&#8201;2,4&#8208;dibenzylidene&#8208;d&#8208;sorbitol: pH&#8208;responsive DBS&#8208;COOH and thermally responsive DBS&#8208;CONHNH2, thus clearly demonstrating that different classes of LMWG can be fabricated into gel beads by using this approach. We also demonstrate that self&#8208;assembled multicomponent gel beads can be formed by using different combinations of these gelators. The different gel bead formulations exhibit different responsiveness &#8211; the DBS&#8208;COOH network can disassemble within those beads in which it is present upon raising the pH. To exemplify preliminary data for a potential application for these hybrid gel beads, we explored aspects of the delivery of the lipid&#8208;lowering active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) rosuvastatin. The release profile of this statin from the hybrid gel beads is pH&#8208;dependent, with greater release at pH&#8197;7.4 than at pH&#8197;4.0 &#8211; primary control of this process results from the pKa of the API. The extent of pH&#8208;mediated API release is also significantly further modified according to gel bead composition. The DBS&#8208;COOH/alginate beads show rapid, highly effective drug release at pH&#8197;7.4, whereas the three&#8208;component DBS&#8208;COOH/DBS&#8208;CONHNH2/alginate system shows controlled slow release of the API under the same conditions. These initial results indicate that such gel beads constitute a promising, versatile and easily tuned platform suitable for further development for controlled drug&#8208;delivery applications.

The release profile of this statin from the hybrid gel beads is pH-dependent, with greater release at pH&#8197;7.4 than at pH&#8197;4.0 &#8211; primary control of this process results from the p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of the API. The extent of pH-mediated API release is also significantly further modified according to gel bead composition. The DBS-COOH/alginate beads show rapid, highly effective drug release at pH&#8197;7.4, whereas the three-component DBS-COOH/DBS-CONHNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/alginate system shows controlled slow release of the API under the same conditions. These initial results indicate that such gel beads constitute a promising, versatile and easily tuned platform suitable for further development for controlled drug-delivery applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Binding Sites, Vibrations and Spin&#8208;Lattice Relaxation Times in Europium(II)&#8208;Based Metallofullerene Spin Qubits</title>

         <dc:description>
The investigation of the spin dynamics in a series of chemically designed europium(II)&#8208;based endohedral metallofullerenes (EMFs) is reported. As a unique structural difference, metal&#8208;cage binding site can be introduced in EMFs and is demonstrated to play a key role in determining rigidity of the three low&#8208;energy metal&#8208;displacing vibrations and the spin&#8208;lattice relaxation times (T1). Normalized by the frequencies of these vibrations, the temperature dependence of T1 shows a universal behavior for different compounds in frozen CS2 solution.







Abstract
To design molecular spin qubits with enhanced quantum coherence, a control of the coupling between the local vibrations and the spin states is crucial, which could be realized in principle by engineering molecular structures via coordination chemistry. To this end, understanding the underlying structural factors that govern the spin relaxation is a central topic. Here, we report the investigation of the spin dynamics in a series of chemically designed europium(II)&#8208;based endohedral metallofullerenes (EMFs). By introducing a unique structural difference, i.&#8201;e. metal&#8208;cage binding site, while keeping other molecular parameters constant between different complexes, these manifest the key role of the three low&#8208;energy metal&#8208;displacing vibrations in mediating the spin&#8208;lattice relaxation times (T1). The temperature dependence of T1 can thus be normalized by the frequencies of these low energy vibrations to show an unprecedentedly universal behavior for EMFs in frozen CS2 solution. Our theoretical analysis indicates that this structural difference determines not only the vibrational rigidity but also spin&#8208;vibration coupling in these EMF&#8208;based qubit candidates.

         <title>Topological Transformation of Mg&#8208;Containing Layered Double Hydroxide Nanosheets for Efficient Photodriven CH4 Coupling</title>

A heterostructural Co&#8208;doped MgO&#8208;based catalyst, MgCo&#8208;800, was synthesized by topological transformation of a MgCo&#8208;layered double hydroxide (MgCo&#8208;LDH) precursor. With its highly dispersed active sites and abundant interfaces, MgCo&#8208;800 enabled surface activation of CH4 to methyl species and showed remarkable photodriven CH4 coupling to C2H6 with a selectivity of 41.60&#8201;% within 3&#8197;h under full&#8208;spectrum irradiation.







Abstract
Direct conversion of methane (CH4) to fuels and other high value&#8208;added chemicals is an attractive technology in the chemical industry; however, practical challenges to sustainable processes remain. Herein, we report the preparation of a heterostructured Co&#8208;doped MgO&#8208;based catalyst through topological transformation of a MgCo&#8208;layered double hydroxide (LDH) calcination from 200 to 1100&#8201;&#176;C. Remarkably, the catalyst can activate CH4 coupling to produce C2H6 with a selectivity of 41.60&#8201;% within 3&#8197;h under full&#8208;spectrum irradiation through calcination of LDH at 800&#8201;&#176;C. Characterization studies and catalytic results suggest that the highly dispersed active sites and large interfaces amongst the Co&#8208;doped MgO&#8208;based catalysts enable surface activation of CH4 to methyl (CH3*), in turn promoting coupling of CH3* to C2H6. This study introduces a promising pathway for photodriven CH4 coupling to give high value&#8208;added chemicals by using layered double hydroxides as a precursor.

         <title>Selective Oxygen and Hydrogen Functionalization of the h&#8208;BN/Rh(111) Nanomesh</title>

Confined functionalization: In this study, we achieved covalent functionalization of the hexagonal boron nitride nanomesh on Rh(111) with oxygen molecules and hydrogen atoms. The adsorption and thermal stability were investigated using synchrotron radiation&#8208;based in&#8197;situ high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, temperature&#8208;programmed X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. It was found that the functionalization is restricted to the pores of the nanomesh leading to spatially defined chemical modification of the two&#8208;dimensional material.







Abstract
We present detailed studies on the covalent adsorption of molecular oxygen and atomic hydrogen on the hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) nanomesh on Rh(111). The functionalization of this two&#8208;dimensional (2D) material was investigated under ultra&#8208;high vacuum conditions using synchrotron radiation&#8208;based in&#8197;situ high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, temperature&#8208;programmed X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. We are able to provide a deep insight into the adsorption behavior and thermal stability of oxygen and hydrogen on h&#8208;BN/Rh(111). Oxygen functionalization was achieved via a supersonic molecular beam while hydrogen functionalization was realized using an atomic hydrogen source. Adsorption of the respective species was observed to occur selectively in the pores of h&#8208;BN leading to spatially defined modification of the 2D layer. The adsorption of the observed molecular oxygen species was found to be an activated process that requires high&#8208;energy oxygen molecules. Upon heating to 700&#8197;K, oxygen functionalization was observed to be almost reversible except for small amounts of boron oxides evolving due to the reaction of oxygen with the 2D material. Hydrogen functionalization of h&#8208;BN/Rh(111) was fully reversed upon heating to about 640&#8197;K.

Circles in a spiral: The synthesis and physical properties of a helical chiral bicyclic hydrocarbon are presented. The design of the Gel&#228;nder architecture is based on a rigid, chiral, room&#8208;temperature&#8208;stable central ortho&#8208;tetraphenylene subunit, which is further developed and twice macrocyclized to provide the target structure. Pure enantiomers are obtained by chromatography with a chiral stationary phase and allow the investigation of the chiroptical properties. Comparison between recorded and simulated CD spectra allows these enantiostable model compounds to be assigned.







Abstract
A new type of &#8220;Gel&#228;nder&#8221; molecule based on a ortho&#8208;tetraphenylene core is presented. The central para&#8208;quaterphenyl backbone is wrapped by a 4,4&#8217;&#8208;di((Z)&#8208;styryl)&#8208;1,1&#8217;&#8208;biphenyl banister, with its aryl rings covalently attached to all four phenyl rings of the backbone. The resulting helical chiral bicyclic architecture consists exclusively of sp2&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms. The target structure was assembled by expanding the central ortho&#8208;tetraphenylene subunit with the required additional phenyl rings followed by a twofold macrocyclization. The first macrocyclization attempts based on a twofold McMurry coupling were successful but low yielding; the second strategy, profiting from olefin metathesis, provided satisfying yields. Hydrogenation of the olefins resulted in a saturated derivative of similar topology, thereby allowing the interdependence between saturation and physico&#8208;chemical properties to be studied. The target structures, including their solid&#8208;state structures, were fully characterized. The helical chiral bicycle was synthesized as a racemate and separated into pure enantiomers by HPLC on a chiral stationary phase. Comparison of recorded and simulated chiroptical properties allowed the enantiomers to be assigned.

The central &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-quaterphenyl backbone is wrapped by a 4,4&#8217;-di((&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;)-styryl)-1,1&#8217;-biphenyl banister, with its aryl rings covalently attached to all four phenyl rings of the backbone. The resulting helical chiral bicyclic architecture consists exclusively of sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-hybridized carbon atoms. The target structure was assembled by expanding the central &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-tetraphenylene subunit with the required additional phenyl rings followed by a twofold macrocyclization. The first macrocyclization attempts based on a twofold McMurry coupling were successful but low yielding; the second strategy, profiting from olefin metathesis, provided satisfying yields. Hydrogenation of the olefins resulted in a saturated derivative of similar topology, thereby allowing the interdependence between saturation and physico-chemical properties to be studied. The target structures, including their solid-state structures, were fully characterized. The helical chiral bicycle was synthesized as a racemate and separated into pure enantiomers by HPLC on a chiral stationary phase. Comparison of recorded and simulated chiroptical properties allowed the enantiomers to be assigned.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
The way chemical transformations are described by models based on microscopic reversibility does not take into account the irreversibility of natural processes, and therefore, in complex chemical networks working in open systems, misunderstandings may arise about the origin and causes of the stability of non&#8208;equilibrium stationary states, and general constraints on evolution in systems that are far from equilibrium. For more details, see the Concept by J.&#8197;M. Rib&#243; and D. Hochberg on page 13098&#8197;ff.

         <title>Front Cover: Non&#8208;conventional Behavior of a 2,1&#8208;Benzazaphosphole: Heterodiene or Hidden Phosphinidene? (Chem. Eur. J. 52/2021)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 52, Page 13092-13092, September 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a Natural Resonance Theory study, 2,1&#8208;benzazaphosphole exhibits a dualistic behavior and can serve as a heterodiene or a hidden phosphinidene. This intriguing property has been confirmed chemically. It is able to react with established dienophiles via hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction, thereby forming new heterocyclic compounds, but it also donates two transition metals as a 4e ligand, thus mimicking a phosphinidene character. More information can be found in the Full Paper by Z. Benk&#337;, L. Dost&#225;l, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101686).

An efficient approach to patterning 2D MoS2 through covalent functionalization of electron beam lithography (EBL)&#8208;defined guiding patterns has been demonstrated by A. Hirsch et al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102021). This approach opens a convenient avenue for spatially designing and engineering MoS2 nanostructures, and would benefit further exploration of MoS2&#8208;based devices and facilitate efficient manufacture.

         <title>Cover Feature: Selective Oxygen and Hydrogen Functionalization of the h&#8208;BN/Rh(111) Nanomesh (Chem. Eur. J. 52/2021)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 52, Page 13095-13095, September 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using an atomic hydrogen source and a supersonic molecular beam of oxygen, the hexagonal boron nitride nanomesh on Rh(111) was covalently functionalized with molecular oxygen and atomic hydrogen. Investigation of the system by high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals that only the pores of the nanomesh are functionalized whereas the wires remain unaffected. This selectivity leads to spatially defined chemical functionalization of the corrugated two&#8208;dimensional material. More information can be found in the Full Paper by C. Papp et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101946).

Taking the strain: An emulsion gel with high stretchability and conductivity was fabricated and could be used as a strain sensor to detect human motion over a broad operating temperature. First, an emulsion that was ultra&#8208;stable at high and low temperatures was prepared by introducing glycerol into a W/W emulsion. Then, the continuous phase was polymerized to produce a macroporous emulsion gel. Finally, an emulsion&#8208;gel&#8208;based strain sensor with good flexibility, conductivity, self&#8208;healing, and adhesion properties was fabricated to detect the full range of human body movement. The sensor exhibited remarkable sensing sensitivity, rapid responsiveness, and reliability. For more information, see the Full Paper by J. Hao et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101472).

         <title>Allenes and Dienes as Chiral Allylmetal Pronucleophiles in Catalytic Enantioselective C=X Addition: Historical Perspective and State&#8208;of&#8208;The&#8208;Art Survey</title>

Beyond preformed allylmetal reagents: In this review, the emerging use of allenes and dienes as chiral allylmetal pronucleophiles in catalytic enantioselective reductive additions to aldehydes, ketones, imines, carbon dioxide and other C=X (X=C, O, N) electrophiles is exhaustively catalogued.







Abstract
The use of allenes and 1,3&#8208;dienes as chiral allylmetal pronucleophiles in intermolecular catalytic enantioselective reductive additions to aldehydes, ketones, imines, carbon dioxide and other C=X electrophiles is exhaustively catalogued together with redox&#8208;neutral hydrogen auto&#8208;transfer processes. Coverage is limited to processes that result in both C&#8722;H and C&#8722;C bond formation. The use of alkynes as latent allylmetal pronucleophiles and multicomponent C=X allylations involving allenes and dienes is not covered. As illustrated in this review, the ability of allenes and 1,3&#8208;dienes to serve as tractable non&#8208;metallic pronucleophiles has evoked many useful transformations that have no counterpart in traditional allylmetal chemistry.

         <title>Covalent Patterning of 2D MoS2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 52, Page 13117-13122, September 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The patterned 2D MoS2 surface was achieved through covalent functionalization of electron beam lithography (EBL) defined guiding areas. The patterned MoS2 surface displays switchable surface characteristics in a spatially defined manner, confirmed by scanning Raman spectroscopy and PL mapping, which may hold great promise for the development of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electronic and optoelectronic devices.







Abstract
The development of an efficient method to patterning 2D MoS2 into a desired topographic structure is of particular importance to bridge the way towards the ultimate device. Herein, we demonstrate a patterning strategy by combining the electron beam lithography with the surface covalent functionalization. This strategy allows us to generate delicate MoS2 ribbon patterns with a minimum feature size of 2&#8197;&#956;m in a high throughput rate. The patterned monolayer MoS2 domain consists of a spatially well&#8208;defined heterophase homojunction and alternately distributed surface characteristics, which holds great interest for further exploration of MoS2 based devices.

         <title>Targeted Chemical Modifications Identify Key Features of Carbohydrate Assemblies and Generate Tailored Carbohydrate Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 52, Page 13139-13143, September 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Site&#8208;specific modifications identified key non&#8208;covalent interactions responsible for the supramolecular assembly of a disaccharide model. Electron diffraction (ED) and tomography enabled the correlation between molecular structure and nanoscale architecture, confirming that C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; edge&#8208;to&#8208;face type interactions between the aromatic rings and water&#8208;bridged hydrogen bonds between specific hydroxyl groups stabilized the assembly. The synthetic compounds were used to generate carbohydrate&#8208;based nanotubes, twisted ribbons, as well as spherical particles that were characterized with molecular level resolution.







Abstract
The molecular level description of carbohydrate assemblies is hampered by their structural complexity and the lack of suitable analytical methods. Here, we employed systematic chemical modifications to identify key non&#8208;covalent interactions that triggered the supramolecular assembly of a disaccharide model. While some modifications disrupted the supramolecular organization, others were tolerated, delivering important information on the aggregation process. The screening identified new geometries, including nanotubes, and twisted ribbons that were characterized with electron tomography and electron diffraction (ED) methods. This work demonstrates that the combination of synthetic chemistry and ED methods is a powerful tool to draw correlations between the molecular structure and the nanoscale architecture of carbohydrate assemblies.

The interactions causing the action: Square planar platinum complexes aggregate into polymorphs with different intermolecular interactions leading to unique photophysical properties. Strong intermolecular interactions stabilize the aggregate to such an extent that the polymorphs can be separated by column chromatography. Solid&#8208;state structures, quantum chemical calculations, concentration&#8208;dependent excitation&#8211;emission spectroscopy, and solid&#8208;state emission spectroscopy help to rationalize and shed light on the nature of this phenomenon.

Platinum complexes aggregate into polymorphs with different intermolecular interactions leading to different photophysical properties. Strong intermolecular interactions stabilize the aggregate to such an extent that the polymorphs can be separated directly by column chromatography.

         <title>Ytterbium (II) Hydride as a Powerful Multielectron Reductant</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 52, Page 13144-13148, September 15, 2021. </description>

A molecular ytterbium(II) hydride enables the two&#8208;electron aromatization of 1,3,5,7&#8208;cyclooctatetraene to provide an inverse sandwich diytterbium cyclooctatetraenyl derivative and hydrogen gas. This reactivity was extended to the more challenging two&#8208;electron reduction of polyaromatic hydrocarbons, including naphthalene (E0=&#8722;2.60&#8197;V), with retention of metal oxidation state. This reactivity proceeds via consecutive polarized Yb&#8722;H/C=C insertion and deprotonation pathways that occurs at the dimeric hydride reagent.







Abstract
A dimeric &#946;&#8208;diketiminato ytterbium(II) hydride affects both the two&#8208;electron aromatization of 1,3,5,7&#8208;cyclooctatetraene (COT) and the more challenging two&#8208;electron reduction of polyaromatic hydrocarbons, including naphthalene (E0=&#8722;2.60&#8197;V). Confirmed by Density Functional Theory calculations, these reactions proceed via consecutive polarized Yb&#8722;H/C=C insertion and deprotonation steps to provide the respective ytterbium (II) inverse sandwich complexes and hydrogen gas. These observations highlight the ability of a simple ytterbium(II) hydride to act as a powerful two&#8208;electron reductant at room temperature without the necessity of an external electron to initiate the reaction and avoiding radicaloid intermediates.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A molecular ytterbium(II) hydride&lt;/b&gt; enables the two-electron aromatization of 1,3,5,7-cyclooctatetraene to provide an inverse sandwich diytterbium cyclooctatetraenyl derivative and hydrogen gas. This reactivity was extended to the more challenging two-electron reduction of polyaromatic hydrocarbons, including naphthalene (E&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;=&#8722;2.60&#8197;V), with retention of metal oxidation state. This reactivity proceeds via consecutive polarized Yb&#8722;H/C=C insertion and deprotonation pathways that occurs at the dimeric hydride reagent.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Iod(az)olium Salts &#8211; Potent Halogen&#8208;Bond Donors in Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 52, Page 13128-13134, September 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Heterocyclic iod(az)olium salts are introduced as highly potent halogen bonding (XB) organocatalysts reactivity in diverse test reactions based on the activation of halides and neutral species. Especially, N&#8208;methylated, dicationic derivatives outperformed all known monodentate iodine(I) and (III) XB&#8208;donors as well as the strong Lewis acid BF3.







Abstract
This article describes the application of N&#8208;heterocyclic iod(az)olium salts (NHISs) as highly reactive organocatalysts. A variety of mono&#8208; and dicationic NHISs are described and utilized as potent XB&#8208;donors in halogen&#8208;bond catalysis. They were benchmarked in seven diverse test reactions in which the activation of carbon&#8208; and metal&#8208;chloride bonds as well as carbonyl and nitro groups was achieved. N&#8208;methylated dicationic NHISs rendered the highest reactivity in all investigated catalytic applications with reactivities even higher than all previously described monodentate XB&#8208;donors based on iodine(I) and (III) and the strong Lewis acid BF3.

         <title>Cascade Reaction to Selectively Synthesize Multifunctional Indole Derivatives by IrIII&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Activation</title>

C&#8722;H activation cascade reaction: An effective way to synthesize a variety of functionalized indoles with potent biological properties has been developed. Notably, 2,4&#8208;dialkynyl indole products were obtained by direct double alkynylation of C&#8722;H bonds, whereas alkynyl on C4 position might convert to carbonyl to generate 2&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;3,4&#8208;diacetyl indoles. Additionally, relay catalysis allowed the synthesis of 2,5&#8208;di&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;3,4&#8208;diacetyl indoles by using an in&#8197;situ carbonyl group as the directing group.







Abstract
An effective and condition&#8208;controlled way to synthesize with high selectivity a variety of functionalized indoles with potent biological properties has been developed. Notably, 2,4&#8208;dialkynyl indole products were obtained by direct double C&#8722;H bond alkynylation, whereas alkynyl at the C4 position could convert to carbonyl to generate 2&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;3,4&#8208;diacetyl indoles fast and effectively. Additionally, a one&#8208;pot relay catalytic reaction led to 2,5&#8208;di&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;3,4&#8208;diacetyl indoles when using a carbonyl group as the directing group and by controlling the type and quantity of additives. A possible mechanism was proposed based on many studies including deuterium&#8208;exchange experiments, the necessary conditions of product conversion, and the effect of water on the reaction.

&#8220;The dual behavior of the 2,1&#8208;benzazaphosphole mentioned in the title of this manuscript predicted by a theoretical NRT study represents the most significant point of this paper. Thus, a quite easily accessible molecule allowed us to observe two totally different reactivities; i.e., heterodyne&#8208; versus phosphinidene&#8208;like, both of them being highly desirable regarding future applications.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;13149&#8197;ff.

         <title>Towards an Understanding of the Molecular Mechanisms of Variable Unnatural Base&#8208;Pair Behavior: A Biophysical Analysis of dNaM&#8208;dTPT3</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interdisciplinary study: The (d)NaM:(d)TPT3 unnatural base pair (UBP) can be replicated, transcribed, and translated in an organism, but its sequence context and orientation affects the fidelity and efficiency of these processes. We determined how this UBP affects nucleic acid duplexes, which provides mechanisms for variable behavior and can inform future UBP development.







Abstract
The series of unnatural base pairs (UBPs) developed by the Romesberg lab, which pair via hydrophobic and packing interactions have been replicated, transcribed, and translated inside of a living organism. However, as to why these UBPs exhibit variable fidelity and efficiency when used in different contexts is not clear. In an effort to gain some insights, we investigated the thermal stability and pairing selectivity of the (d)NaM&#8208;(d)TPT3 UBP in 11nt duplexes via UV spectroscopy and the effects on helical structure via CD spectroscopy. We observed that while the duplexes containing a UBP are less stable than fully natural duplexes, they are generally more stable than duplexes containing natural mispairs. This work provides the first insights connecting the thermal stability of the (d)NaM&#8208;(d)TPT3 UBP to the molecular mechanisms for varying replication fidelity in different sequence contexts in DNA, asymmetrical transcription fidelity, and codon:anticodon interactions and can assist in future UBP development.

         <title>Stepwise increase NdIII&#8208;based phosphorescence by AIE&#8208;active sensitizer: Broaden AIPE family from transition metals to discrete NIR lanthanide complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We designed two near&#8208;infrared lanthanide complexes [(  L  )  2  &#8208;Nd(NO  3  )  3  ] (  L  = TPE  2  &#8208;BPY for  1  , TPE&#8208;BPY for  2  ) by employing aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active tetraphenylethylene (TPE) derivatives as sensitizers, which possessed matched energy to Nd  III  , effectively preventing competitive deactivation under aggregation, even shifting the excitation window toward 600 nm by twisted intramolecular charge transfer. Furthermore, benefiting from the 4  f  electron shielding effect and antenna effect, the enhanced excitation energies of the AIE&#8208;active sensitizers by structural rigidification transferred into the inert Nd  III  excited state through  3  LMCT, affording the first aggregation&#8208;induced phosphorescence enhancement (AIPE)&#8208;active discrete NIR&#8208;emitting lanthanide complexes. As  1  equipped with more AIE&#8208;active TPE than  2  ,  L  &#8594;Nd energy transfer efficiency of the former was larger than that of the latter under the same conditions. Moreover, the crystal of  1  exhibited one of the longest lifetimes (9.69  &#956;  s) among Nd  III  &#8208;based complexes containing C&#8722;H bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Umbelliferone Decorated Water&#8208;soluble Zinc(II) Phthalocyanines &#8211; In Vitro Phototoxic Antimicrobial Anti&#8208;cancer Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Presented here are umbelliferone substituted water&#8208;soluble zinc(II)&#160;phthalocyanines, which are able to inactivate efficiently Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria and are also active against HepG2 cancer cells. The compounds were investigated concerning their phototoxicity as well as their photophysical properties and their aggregation behavior.







Abstract
In this contribution we report on the synthesis, characterization and application of water&#8208;soluble zinc(II) phthalocyanines, which are decorated with four or eight umbelliferone moieties for photodynamic therapy (PDT). These compounds are linked peripherally to zinc(II) phthalocyanine by a triethylene glycol linker attached to pyridines, leading to cationic pyridinium units, able to increase the water solubility of the system. Beside their photophysical properties they were analyzed concerning their cellular distribution in human hepatocyte carcinoma (HepG2) cells as well as their phototoxicity towards HepG2 cells, Gram&#8208;positive (S. aureus strain 3150/12 and B. subtilis strain DB104) and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria (E. coli strain UTI89 and E. coli strain Nissle 1917). At low light doses and concentrations, they exhibit superb antimicrobial activity against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria as well as anti&#8208;tumor activity against HepG2. They are even capable to inactivate Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, whereas the dark toxicity remains low. These unique water&#8208;soluble compounds can be regarded as all&#8208;in&#8208;one type photosensitizers with broad applications ranges in the future.

         <title>Group 15 and 16 Nitrene&#8208;Like Pnictinidenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Singlet&#8208;triplet gap energies are computed for simple pnictinidene moieties to offer theoretical insights and motivate future work on heavier pnictogen containing species.







Abstract
Pnictinidenes are an increasingly relevant species in main group chemistry and generally exhibit proclivity for the triplet electronic ground state. However, the elusive singlet electronic states are often desired for chemical applications. We predict the singlet&#8208;triplet energy differences (&#916;EST=ESinglet&#8722;ETriplet) of simple group 15 and 16 substituted pnictinidenes (Pn&#8722;R; Pn=P, As, Sb, or Bi) with highly reliable focal&#8208;point analyses targeting the CCSDTQ/CBS level of theory. The only cases we predict to have favorable singlet states are P&#8722;PH2 (&#8722;3.2&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and P&#8722;NH2 (&#8722;0.2&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1). &#916;EST trends are discussed in light of the geometric predictions as well as qualitative natural bond order analysis to elucidate some of the important electronic structure features. Our work provides a rigorous benchmark for the &#916;EST of fundamental Pn&#8722;R moieties and provides a firm foundation for the continued study of heavier pnictinidenes.

         <title>Titanium Vacancies in TiO2 Nanofibers Enable Highly Efficient Photodriven Seawater Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Erosion of corrosion: TiO2 nanofibers with rich Ti vacancies have been designed by a facile controllable calcination approach. They exhibit efficient charge transfer and resistance to corrosion by seawater owing to a unidirectional electron trap and superior H+ adsorption; which contribute to excellent activity and long&#8208;time stability in photodriven seawater splitting. This study could provide a promising strategy for the design of efficient semiconductors in marine applications.







Abstract
Photodriven seawater splitting is considered to be one of the most promising techniques for sustainable hydrogen production. However, the high salinity of seawater would deactivate catalysts and consume the photogenerated carriers. Metal vacancies in metal oxide semiconductors are critical to directed electron transfer and high salinity resistance; they are thus desirable but remain a challenge. We demonstrate a facile controllable calcination approach to synthesize TiO2 nanofibers with rich Ti vacancies with excellent photo/electro performances and long&#8208;time stability in photodriven seawater splitting, including photocatalysis and photo&#8208;electrocatalysis. Experimental measurements and theoretical calculations reveal the formation of titanium vacancies, as well as unidirectional electron trap and superior H+ adsorption ability for efficient charge transfer and resistance to corrosion by seawater. Therefore, atomic&#8208;/nanoscale characteristics and mechanism have been proposed to clarify the generation of titanium vacancies and the corresponding interfacial electron transfer.

         <title>Application of Multinuclear MAS NMR for the in&#8197;situ Monitoring of Hydrothermal Synthesis of Zeolites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potential of in&#8197;situ multinuclear MAS NMR spectroscopy for monitoring hydrothermal synthesis of zeolites is demonstrated in the Review. The technique enables the detection of intermediate species stable only under hydrothermal conditions, provides information on the kinetics of synthesis and gives insight into the mechanism of gel formation, gel aging, crystal nucleation and growth.







Abstract
In situ MAS NMR studies on the monitoring of hydrothermal synthesis of zeolites are reviewed. The first part of the review contains information on the experimental techniques used for the in&#8197;situ NMR studies in static and MAS conditions. In the second part, the main capabilities of the in&#8197;situ 1H, 11B, 13C, 14N, 19F, 23Na, 27Al, 29Si and 31P MAS NMR for the elucidation of the mechanism of hydrothermal synthesis of zeolites are examined and the data on NMR lines identification are summarized. In the last part the main application areas of the techniques are considered and illustrated with examples taken from the mechanistic studies of zeolites A, X, MFI and BEA synthesis. A cross&#8208;reference index between the materials studied, the experimental approaches used, the mechanistic information obtained, and the corresponding literature sources is established.

         <title>Low&#8208;Valent Germanylidene Anions: Efficient Single&#8208;Site Nucleophiles for Activation of Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stepwise reduction of germylenes via stable and isolable germanium radicals yields germanylidene anions supported by cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene and hypermetallyl ligands. The anions contain a highly electron&#8208;rich germanium centre with significant ylidone character and are efficient single&#8208;site nucleophiles that react even with weak electrophiles.







Abstract
Rare mononuclear and helical chain low&#8208;valent germanylidene anions supported by cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene and hypermetallyl ligands were synthesised by stepwise reduction from corresponding germylene precursors via stable and isolable germanium radicals. The electronic structures of the anions can be described with ylidene and ylidone resonance forms with the Ge&#8722;C &#960;&#8208;electrons capable of binding even weak electrophiles. The germanylidene anions reacted with CO2 to give &#956;&#8208;CO2&#8208;&#954;C:&#954;O complexes, a rare coordination mode for low&#8208;valent germanium and inaccessible for the related neutral germylones. These results implicate low&#8208;valent germanylidene anions as efficient single&#8208;site nucleophiles for activation of small molecules.

         <title>Selective One&#8208;Pot Syntheses of Mixed Silicon&#8208;Germanium Heteroadamantane Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Toward novel nanoclusters: The fourfold SiCl3&#8208;substituted Si4Ge6 ([0]), Si5Ge5 ([1]), and Si6Ge4 ([2]) heteroadamantane cores are accessible directly from Me2GeCl2 and Si2Cl6/Cl&#8722; in a time&#8208; and cost&#8208;efficient synthesis. In a chloride ion&#8208;mediated rearrangement, [2] is converted into [1] at room temperature and into [0] at 60&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
SixGey alloys are emerging materials for modern semiconductor technology. Well&#8208;defined model systems of the bulk structures aid in understanding their intrinsic characteristics. Three such model clusters have now been realized in the form of the SixGey heteroadamantanes [0], [1], and [2] through selective one&#8208;pot syntheses starting from Me2GeCl2, Si2Cl6, and [nBu4N]Cl. Compound [0] contains six GeMe2 and four SiSiCl3 vertices, whereas one and two of the GeMe2 groups are replaced by SiCl2 moieties in compounds [1] and [2], respectively. Chloride&#8208;ion&#8208;mediated rearrangement quantitatively converts [2] into [1] at room temperature and finally into [0] at 60&#8201;&#176;C, which is not only remarkable in view of the rigidity of these cage structures but also sheds light on the assembly mechanism.

         <title>Rational Fabrication of Multiple Dimensional Assemblies from Tryptophan&#8208;Based Racemate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Every dimension: Tryptophan&#8208;based racemate (RPWM) could assemble into 1D bundled nanofibers, 2D lamellar nanostructure and 3D urchin&#8208;like microflowers in ethanol/toluene, ethanol/H2O and ethanol/cyclohexane co&#8208;solvents (v:v=1&#8201;:&#8201;9), respectively. The uniform 0D nanospheres formed in ethanol/H2O under 4&#8201;&#176;C were able to convert into lamella spontaneously under ambient temperature. Taking advantages of the temperature&#8208;responsive morphological transformation, RPWM exhibited extremely high removal ability toward organic dye molecules and also possessed good reusability.







Abstract
Fabricating structural complex assemblies from simple amino acid&#8208;based derivatives is attracting great research interests due to their easy accessibility and preparation. However, the morphological regulation of racemates (an equimolar mixture of enantiomers) were largely overlooked. In this work, through rational modulation of kinetic and thermodynamic parameters, we achieved multiple dimensional architectures employing tryptophan&#8208;based racemate (RPWM). Upon assembling, 1D bundled nanofibers, 2D lamellar nanostructure and 3D urchin&#8208;like microflowers could be obtained depending on the solvents used. The corresponding morphology evolutions were successfully illustrated by changing the enantiomeric excess (ee) value. Moreover, for RPWM, uniform 0D nanospheres were formed in H2O under 4&#8201;&#176;C, which could spontaneously convert into lamella under ambient temperature. Taking advantages of its temperature&#8208;responsive phase change behavior, RPWM assemblies exhibited excellent removal efficiency for organic dye RhB, and could be reused for several consecutive cycles without significant changes in its removal performance. Taken together, it's rational to envision that the engineering of racemates assembly pathways can greatly increase the robustness in a wide variety of supramolecular materials and further lead to their blooming versatile applications.

         <title>Iron Binding in the Ferroxidase Site of Human Mitochondrial Ferritin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Human mitochondrial ferritin (hMTF) performs its ferroxidase activity by oxidizing Fe(II) to Fe(III) in the presence of dioxygen. Here, we performed kinetic measurements and time&#8208;lapse X&#8208;ray crystallography analysis, providing the first structural evidence of iron ions binding to the ferroxidase site of hMTF and of the transient iron binding sites occuring from the entry channel to the catalytic center.







Abstract
Ferritins are nanocage proteins that store iron ions in their central cavity as hydrated ferric oxide biominerals. In mammals, further the L (light) and H (heavy) chains constituting cytoplasmic maxi&#8208;ferritins, an additional type of ferritin has been identified, the mitochondrial ferritin (MTF). Human MTF (hMTF) is a functional homopolymeric H&#8208;like ferritin performing the ferroxidase activity in its ferroxidase site (FS), in which Fe(II) is oxidized to Fe(III) in the presence of dioxygen. To better investigate its ferroxidase properties, here we performed time&#8208;lapse X&#8208;ray crystallography analysis of hMTF, providing structural evidence of how iron ions interact with hMTF and of their binding to the FS. Transient iron binding sites, populating the pathway along the cage from the iron entry channel to the catalytic center, were also identified. Furthermore, our kinetic data at variable iron loads indicate that the catalytic iron oxidation reaction occurs via a diferric peroxo intermediate followed by the formation of ferric&#8208;oxo species, with significant differences with respect to human H&#8208;type ferritin.

         <title>The Influence of Secondary Interactions on the [N&#8722;I&#8722;N]+ Halogen Bond</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;center halogen bond modulates the reactivity of a halonium ion and is thereby applicable for controlling the halogenation of alkenes. Chelation, strain, steric hindrance, and electrostatic interactions influence the halonium release rate. Combined experimental and theoretical analysis of the reaction mechanism highlights the impact of secondary interactions, and is expected to provide a handle on the induction of stereoselectivity in electrophilic halogenation.

     alt="The Influence of Secondary Interactions on the [N&#8722;I&#8722;N]+ Halogen Bond"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A three-center halogen bond&lt;/b&gt; modulates the reactivity of a halonium ion and is thereby applicable for controlling the halogenation of alkenes. Chelation, strain, steric hindrance, and electrostatic interactions influence the halonium release rate. Combined experimental and theoretical analysis of the reaction mechanism highlights the impact of secondary interactions, and is expected to provide a handle on the induction of stereoselectivity in electrophilic halogenation.

         <title>Studies on the application of the Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi reaction to the synthesis of novel fluorinated scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the context of new scaffolds obtained by photochemical reactions, Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi reactions between heteroaromatic, trifluoromethylphenyl ketone and electron rich alkenes to give oxetanes are described. A comprehensive study has then been carried out on the reaction of aromatic ketones with fluorinated alkenes. Depending on the substitution pattern at the oxetane ring, a metathesis reaction is described as a minor side process to give mono fluorinated alkenes. Overall, this last reaction corresponds to a photo&#8208;Wittig reactions and yield amid isosteres. In order to explain the uncommon regioselectivity of the Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi reaction with these alkenes, electrostatic&#8208;potential derived charges (ESP) have been determined. In a second computational study, the relative stabilities of the typical 1,4&#8208;diradical intermediates of the Patern&#242;B&#252;chi reaction have been determined. The results well explain the regioselectivity. Further transformations of the oxetanes or previous functionalization of the fluoroalkenes open perspectives for oxetanes as core structures for biologically active compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Li Plating and Stripping using Vertically Aligned Graphene/CNT Channels Decorated with ZnO Particles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium (Li) metal is regarded as an ultimate anode material for use in Li batteries due to its high theoretical capacity (3860 mA h g&#8208;1). However, the Li dendrites that are generated during iterative Li plating/stripping cycles cause poor cycling stability and even create vital safety risks, and thus severely handicap the commercial utility of Li metal anodes. Herein, we describe a graphene&#8208; and carbon nanotube (CNT)&#8208;based Li host material that features vertically aligned channels with attached ZnO particles (designated as ZnO@G&#8208;CNT&#8208;C) and show that the material effectively regulates Li plating and stripping. The ZnO@G&#8208;CNT&#8208;C is prepared from an aqueous suspension of Zn(OAc)2, CNTs, and graphene oxide using ice to template channel growth. ZnO@G&#8208;CNT&#8208;C was found to be mechanically robust and capable of guiding Li deposition on the inner walls of the channels without the formation of Li dendrites. When used as an electrode, the material exhibits relatively low polarization for Li plating, fast Li&#8208;ion diffusion, and high Coulombic efficiency, even over hundreds of Li plating/stripping cycles. Moreover, full cells prepared using ZnO@G&#8208;CNT&#8208;C as Li host and LiFePO4 as cathode exhibit outstanding performance in terms of specific capacity (155.9 mA h g&#8208;1 at 0.5 C), rate performance (91.8 mA h g&#8208;1 at 4 C), cycling stability (109.4 mA h g&#8208;1 at 0.5 C after 800 cycles). The methodology described can be readily adapted to enable the use of carbon&#8208;based electrodes with well&#8208;defined channels in a wide range of contemporary applications that pertain to energy storage and delivery.</dc:description>

         <title>Trinuclear cyano&#8208;bridged [Cr2Fe] complexes: to be or not to be a SMM, a matter of straightness</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Trinuclear systems of formula [{Cr(L  N3O2Ph  )(CN)  2  }  2  M(H  2  L  N3O2R  )] (M = Mn  II  and Fe  II  , L  N3O2R2  stands for pentadentate ligands) were prepared in order to assess the influence of the bending of the apical M&#8208;N&#8801;C linkages on the magnetic anisotropy of the Fe  II  derivatives and in turn on their SMM behaviors. The cyanido&#8208;bridged [Cr  2  M] derivatives were obtained by assembling  trans  &#8208;dicyanido Cr  III  complex [Cr(L  N3O2Ph2  )(CN)  2  ]  &#8208;  and divalent pentagonal bipyramid complexes [M  II  (H  2  L  N3O2R2  )]  2+  with various R substituents (R = NH  2  , cyclohexyl,  S  ,  S  &#8208;mandelic) imparting different steric demand to the central moiety of the complexes. A comparative examination of the structural and magnetic properties showed an obvious effect of the deviation from straightness of the M&#8208;N&#8801;C alignment on the slow relaxation of the magnetization exhibited by the [Cr  2  Fe] complexes. Theoretical calculations have highlighted important effects of the straightness of the apical C&#8208;N&#8208;Fe linkages on both the magnetic anisotropy of the Fe  II  center and the exchange interactions with the Cr  III  units.</dc:description>

         <title>Predictive catalysis in olefin metathesis with Ru&#8208;based catalysts with annulated C60 fullerenes in the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Predictive catalysis must be the tool that does not replace experiments, but acts as a selective agent, so that synthetic strategies of maximum profitability are used in the laboratory in a surgical way. Here, nanotechnology has been mixed with olefin metathesis from homogeneous Ru&#8208;NHC catalysts, specifically annulating a C  60  fullerene to the NHC ligand. Based on results with the C  60  in the backbone, a sterile change with respect to the catalysis of the metal center, an attempt has been made to bring C  60  closer to the metal, by attaching it to one of the two C&#8208;N bonds of the imidazole group of the SIMes (1,3&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) ligand (reference NHC ligand of the 2  nd  generation Grubbs catalysts) to increase the steric pressure of C  60  in the first sphere of reactivity of the metal. The DFT calculated thermodynamics and the kinetics of SIMes&#8208;derived systems show that they are efficient catalysts for olefin metathesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Spectral Signatures of Oxidation States in a Manganese&#8208;Oxo Cubane Water Oxidation Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report IR and UV/Vis spectroscopic signatures that allow discriminating among the oxidation states of the manganese&#8208;based water oxidation catalyst [(Mn  4  O  4  )(V  4  O  13  )(OAc)  3  ]  3  &#8722;  . Simulated IR spectra show that V=O stretching vibrations in the 900&#8211;1000cm  &#8722;  1  region shift consistently by about 20cm  &#8722;  1  per oxidation equivalent. Multiple bands in the 1450&#8211;1550cm  &#8722;  1  region also change systematically upon oxidation/reduction. The computed UV/Vis spectra predict that the spectral range above 350nm is characteristic of the managanese&#8208;oxo cubane oxidation state, whereas transitions at higher energy are due to the vanadate ligand. The presence of absorption signals above 680nm is indicative of the presence of Mn  III  atoms. Spectroelectrochemical measurements of the oxidation from [Mn  III  2  Mn  IV  2  ] to [Mn  IV  4  ] showed that the change in oxidation state can indeed be tracked by both IR and UV/Vis spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Host&#8208;guest Complexation between Cyclodextrins and Hybrid Hexavanadates: What are the Driving Forces?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Host&#8208;guest complexes between native cyclodextrins (&#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;CD) and hybrid Lindqvist&#8208;type polyoxovanadates (POVs) [V6O13((OCH2)3C&#8208;R)2]2&#8211;  with R=CH2CH3, NO2, CH2OH and NH(BOC) were studied in aqueous solution. 6 crystal structures determined by SCXRD analysis revealed the nature of the R group strongly influences the host&#8211;guest conformation. In all systems isolated in the solid&#8208;state, the organic groups R are embedded within the CD cavities, involving only a few weak supramolecular contacts. The interaction between hybrid POVs and the macrocyclic organic hosts have been studied in solution using ITC, cyclic voltammetry and NMR methods (1H NMR, and 2D DOSY, and ROESY). This set of complementary techniques provides clear insights about the strength of interactions and the binding host&#8208;guest modes occurring in aqueous solution, highlighting a dramatic influence of the functional group R on the supramolecular properties of the POV (association constant K1:1  vary from 0 to 2 000 M&#8208;1  ) while isolated functional organic groups exhibit only very weak intrinsic affinity with CDs. Electrochemical and calorimetric investigations suggest that the driving force of the host&#8208;guest association involving larger CDs (&#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;CD) is mainly related to the chaotropic effect. In contrast, the hydrophobic effect supported by weak attractive forces appears as the main contributor for the formation of &#945;&#8208;CD&#8208;containing host&#8208;guest complexes. In any cases, the origin of driving forces is clearly related to the ability of the macrocyclic host to desolvate the exposed moieties of the POVs.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogen Bonding Heteroditopic Materials for Cooperative Sodium Iodide Binding and Extraction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of novel heteroditopic halogen bonding (XB) receptor functionalised silica based materials, containing mono&#8208; and bis&#8208;iodotriazole benzo&#8208;15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 groups are investigated for the cooperative binding and extraction of sodium halide ion&#8208;pair species from aqueous solution. Characterisation of the XB materials by CHN elemental analysis,  13  C CP/MAS&#8208;NMR and ATR&#8208;FTIR spectroscopies confirms and quantifies the successful incorporation of the ion&#8208;pair receptor frameworks to the silica material. ICP&#8208;MS solid&#8208;liquid extraction studies demonstrate the bidentate XB functionalised material is capable of NaI extraction from water. Importantly, cooperative XB&#8208;mediated sodium halide ion&#8208;pair binding is determined to be crucial to the material&#8217;s extraction capabilities, impressively demonstrating a two&#8208;fold enhancement in sodium iodide extraction efficiency relative to a heteroditopic hydrogen bonding receptor functionalised silica material analogue.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Synthesis of Photoaffinity Probes for Live&#8208;Cell MS&#8208;Based Proteomics</title>

Get PALs quick: A multicomponent reaction for the one&#8208;step synthesis of PAL probes. A library of diverse bromodomain (BET)&#8208;targeting PAL probes was synthesized and profiled extensively (physicochemical properties, biochemical and cellular activities, photolabeling efficiencies and crystallographic studies). Optimal probes were profiled by MS&#8208;based proteomics to capture BET proteins from live cells and reveal their potential on/off&#8208;target profiles. We envisage that this methodology can be used to quickly access PAL probes for other compounds&#8208;of&#8208;interest and obtain their target profiles.







Abstract
We present a one&#8208;step Ugi reaction protocol for the expedient synthesis of photoaffinity probes for live&#8208;cell MS&#8208;based proteomics. The reaction couples an amine affinity function with commonly used photoreactive groups, and a variety of handle functionalities. Using this technology, a series of pan&#8208;BET (BET: bromodomain and extra&#8208;terminal domain) selective bromodomain photoaffinity probes were obtained by parallel synthesis. Studies on the effects of photoreactive group, linker length and irradiation wavelength on photocrosslinking efficiency provide valuable insights into photoaffinity probe design. Optimal probes were progressed to MS&#8208;based proteomics to capture the BET family of proteins from live cells and reveal their potential on&#8208; and off&#8208;target profiles.

         <title>Electroresponsive Performances of Ecoresorbable Smart Fluids Consisting of Various Plant&#8208;Derived Carrier Liquids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vegetable and mineral: Ecoresorbable smart fluids consisting of various plant&#8208;derived carrier liquids and Mg&#8208;doped SiO2/TiO2 hollow nanoparticles exert superb electroresponsive properties with outstanding polarizability, wettability, and dispersion stability. By examining the performance of smart fluids composed of various oils, it is possible to provide deeper insights into the influence of medium on electroresponsive behavior. The proposed electrorheological fluids are nontoxic and can solve environmental problems.







Abstract
This paper proposes the fabrication of a new type of electrorheological (ER) fluid with ecoresorbable features as well as excellent electroresponsive performance. The proposed ER fluid consists of biocompatible Mg&#8208;doped silica/titania hollow nanoparticles (ST HNPs) suspended in vegetable oils (canola, grapeseed, olive, and soy). The effects of biodegradable plant&#8208;derived carrier liquids on the ER performance are analyzed. The polarizability and wettability of the fabricated ER fluids are studied. The high polarizability of the nanoparticles contributes to the highly electroresponsive performance by inducing electrostatic interactions between the nanoparticles under electric fields; this enables the formation of a rigid and strong fibril structure. A suitable wettability, which represents the favorable interaction between the oil and the nanoparticles, allows the nanoparticles to disperse evenly in the oil and prevents their aggregation, thereby making the formation of a rigid and strong fibrillar structure under the electric field easier.

         <title>Photoluminescence&#8208;Based Techniques for the Detection of Micro&#8208; and Nano&#8208;Plastics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The growing numbers related to plastic pollution are impressive, with ca. 70% of produced plastic (&gt; 350 tonnes/year) being indiscriminately wasted in the environment. The most dangerous forms of plastic pollution for biota and human health are micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;plastics (MNPs), which are ubiquitous and more bioavailable. Their elimination is extremely difficult, but the first challenge is their detection since existing protocols are unsatisfactory for microplastics and mostly absent for nanoplastics. After a discussion of the state of the art for MNPs detection, we specifically revise the techniques based on photoluminescence that represent very promising solutions for this problem.

The most dangerous forms of plastic pollution for biota and human health are micro- and nano-plastics (MNPs), which are ubiquitous and more bioavailable. Their elimination is extremely difficult, but the first challenge is their detection since existing protocols are unsatisfactory for microplastics and mostly absent for nanoplastics. After a discussion of the state of the art for MNPs detection, we specifically revise the techniques based on photoluminescence that represent very promising solutions for this problem. In this context, Nile Red staining is the most used strategy and we show here its pros and limitations, but we also discuss other more recent approaches, such as the use of fluorogenic probes based on perylene-bisimide and on fluorogenic hyaluronan nanogels, with the added values of biocompatibility and water solubility.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>CdS Reinforced with CoSX/NiCo&#8208;LDH Core&#8208;shell Co&#8208;catalyst Demonstrate High Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution and Durability in Anhydrous Ethanol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>At present, inefficient charge separation of single photocatalyst impedes the development of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. In this work, the CoS  X  /NiCo&#8208;LDH core&#8208;shell co&#8208;catalyst was cleverly designed, which exhibit high activity and high stability of hydrogen evolution in anhydrous ethanol system when coupled with CdS. Under visible light (&#955; &#8805; 420 nm) irradiation, the 3%Co/NiCo/CdS composite photocatalyst exhibits a surprisingly high photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 20.67 mmol g  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  , which is 59 times than that of the original CdS. Continuous light for 20 h still showed good cycle stability. In addition, the 3%Co/NiCo/CdS composite catalyst also shows good hydrogen evolution performance under the Na  2  S/Na  2  SO  3  and lactic acid system. The Fluorescence (PL), ultraviolet&#8208;visible diffuse reflectance (UV&#8208;vis) and photoelectrochemical tests show that the coupling of CdS and CoS  X  /NiCo&#8208;LDH not only accelerates the effective transfer of charges, but also greatly increases the absorption range of CdS to visible light. Therefore, the hydrogen evolution activity of the composite photocatalyst has been significantly improved. This work will provide new insights for the construction of new co&#8208;catalysts and the development of composite catalysts for hydrogen evolution in multiple systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Calcined ZnTi&#8208;Layered Double Hydroxide Intercalated with H3PW12O40 with Efficiently Photocatalytic and Adsorption Performances</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Wastewater treatment is of great significance to environmental remediation. The exploration of efficient and stable methods for wastewater treatment is still a challenging issue. Herein, a heterojunction material with photocatalysis and adsorption properties has been designed to remove the complex pollutants from wastewater. The heterojunction material (ZnO/TiO2&#8208;PW12, PW12= [PW12O40]3&#8208;) was synthesized by calcining the ZnTi&#8208;layered double hydroxide (ZnTi&#8208;LDH) intercalated with the Keggin&#8208;type polyoxometalate H3PW12O40. In the construction of ZnO/TiO2&#8208;PW12, it was found that the polyanionic PW12  remained unchanged in the process of forming the proposed heterojunction. The photochemical properties verifies that heterojunction synergistic with PW12  facilitated the separation of photoproduced electron&#8208;hole pairs and thus suppressed the recombination. Therefore, ZnO/TiO2&#8208;PW12  exhibits excellent photocatalytic properties, and the efficiency of Cr(VI) photoreduction reached more than 90% in the first 3 min. Furthermore, the electrostatic force between the PW12  and cationic dyes makes ZnO/TiO2&#8208;PW12  have an outstanding adsorption performance for cationic dyes such as rhodamine B, crystal violet and methyl blue. Such the heterojunction material combined with polyoxometalate puts forwards new insights for the design of functional materials for water treatment with low cost and high efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Transformations of NH&#8208;Sulfoximines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent years have seen a marked increase in the occurrence of sulfoximines in the chemical sciences, often presented as valuable motifs for medicinal chemistry. This has been prompted by both pioneering works taking sulfoximines containing compounds into clinical trials and the concurrent development of powerful synthetic methods. This review covers recent developments in the synthesis of sulfoximines concentrating on developments since 2015. This includes extensive developments in both S&#8208;N and S&#8208;C bond formations. Flow chemistry processes for sulfoximine synthesis are also covered. &#160;Finally, subsequent transformations of sulfoximines, particularly in N&#8208;functionalization are reviewed, including N&#8211;S, N&#8211;P, N&#8211;C bond forming processes and cyclization reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of red&#8208;shifted and fluorogenic nucleoside and oligonucleotide diarylethene photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reversible modulation of fluorescence signals by light is of high interest for applications in super&#8208;resolution microscopy, especially on the DNA level. In this article we describe the systematic variation of the core structure in nucleoside&#8208;based diarylethenes (DAEs), in order to generate intrinsically fluorescent photochromes. The introduction of aromatic bridging units resulted in a bathochromic shift of the visible absorption maximum of the closed&#8208;ring form, but caused reduced thermal stability and switching efficiency. The replacement of the thiophene aryl unit by thiazol improved the thermal stability, whereas the introduction of a benzothiophene unit led to inherent and modulatable turn&#8208;off fluorescence. This feature was further optimized by introducing a fluorescent indole nucleobase into the DAE core, resulting in an effective photoswitch with a fluorescence quantum yield of 0.0125 and a fluorescence turn&#8208;off factor of 3.2. The site&#8208;specific incorporation into an oligonucleotide resulted in fluorescence&#8208;switchable DNA with high cyclization quantum yields and switching efficiency, which may facilitate future applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The covalent attachment of molecular photosensitizers (PS) to polyoxometalates (POMs) opens new pathways to PS&#8208;POM dyads for light&#8208;driven charge&#8208;transfer and charge&#8208;storage. Here we report a synthetic route for the covalent linkage of BODIPY&#8208;dyes to Anderson&#8208;type polyoxomolybdates using CLICK chemistry (  i.e.  copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition, CuAAC). Photophysical properties of the dyad were investigated by combined experimental and theoretical methods and highlight the role of both sub&#8208;components for the charge&#8208;separation properties. The study demonstrates how CLICK chemistry can be used for the versatile linkage of organic functional units to molecular metal oxide clusters.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetic Stabilization of Blue&#8208;Emissive Anthracenes: Phenylene Bridging Works Best</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In attempts at kinetically stabilizing blue&#8208;emissive anthracenes, a series of 9,10&#8208;diaryl substituted derivatives were tested for their photochemical and photooxidative persistence. A major breakthrough in light fastness comes from a new bis&#8208; meta &#8208;terphenylyl substituted anthracene which is much superior to industrially relevant 9,10&#8208;biarylated anthracenes. The key issue is the steric shielding of the anthracene core. Further, intramolecular ring closure via Yamamoto coupling furnished a doubly bridged anthracene as a &#8220;self&#8208;encapsulated&#8221; sky&#8208;blue emitter which is most resistant to photodegradation. The improved stabilization was corroborated by time&#8208;resolved irradiation experiments and rationalized by X&#8208;ray crystallography.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Chemistry Impact on the Light Absorption by Colloidal Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligands at the surface of colloidal quantum dots are intrinsically electronically coupled to the inorganic semiconductor core thus affecting the overall ground state electronic structure and, consequently, the light absorption properties.







Abstract
At the size scale at which quantum confinement effects arise in inorganic semiconductors, the materials&#8217; surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio is intrinsically high. This consideration sets surface chemistry as a powerful tool to exert further control on the electronic structure of the inorganic semiconductors. Among the materials that experience the quantum confinement regime, those prepared via colloidal synthetic procedures (the colloidal quantum dots &#8211; and wires and wells, too &#8211;) are prone to undergo surface reactions in the solution phase and thus represent an ideal framework to study the ensemble impact of surface chemistry on the materials&#8217; electronic structure. It is here discussed such an impact at the ground state by using the absorption spectrum of the colloidal quantum dots as a descriptor. The experiments show that the chemical species (the ligands) at the colloidal quantum dot surface induce changes to the optical band gap, the absorption coefficient at all wavelengths, and the ionization potential. These evidences point to a description of the colloidal quantum dot (the ligand/core adduct) as an indecomposable species, in which the orbitals localized on the ligands and the core mix in each other's electric field. This description goes beyond conventional models that conceive the ligands on the basis of pure electrostatic arguments (i.&#8201;e., either as a dielectric shell or as electric dipoles) or as a mere potential energy barrier at the core boundaries.

         <title>Are Heavy Pnictogen&#8208;&#960; Interactions Really &#8220;&#960; Interactions&#8221;?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Is it, or is it not &#960;? The interaction of heavy pnictogen compounds with benzene and cyclohexane provides an insightful example of whether such interactions are indeed &#8220;&#960; interactions&#8221;. High&#8208;level, ab&#8208;initio calculations show that in both cases the interaction is dominated by dispersion and that this contribution is practically the same with or without a &#960; system.







Abstract
The noncovalent interactions of heavy pnictogens with &#960;&#8208;arenes play a fundamental role in fields like crystal engineering or catalysis. The strength of such bonds is based on an interplay between dispersion and donor/acceptor interactions, and is generally attributed to the presence of &#960;&#8208;arenes. Computational studies of the interaction between the heavy pnictogens As, Sb and Bi and cyclohexane, in comparison with previous studies on the interaction between heavy pnictogens and benzene, show that this concept probably has to be revised. A thorough analysis of all the different energetic components that play a role in these systems, carried out with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art computational methods, sheds light on how they influence one another and the effect that their interplay has on the overall system. Furthermore, the analysis of such interactions leads us to the unexpected finding that the presence of the pnictogen compounds strongly affects the conformational equilibrium of cyclohexane, reversing the relative stability of the chair and boat&#8208;twist conformers, and thus suggesting a possible application of tuneable dispersion energy donors to stabilise the desired conformation.

         <title>A Self&#8208;immolative Molecular Beacon for Amplified Nucleic Acid Detection**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The target as catalyst: A new category of nucleic acid&#8208;templated reaction is introduced. Binding of a self&#8208;immolative molecular beacon (iMB) to a DNA/RNA target can trigger a photocatalyzed cleavage reaction. The products have lower target affinity than the iMB before the reaction. This enables the target to act as a catalyst providing chemical amplification of signals. The unimolecular iMB probe allowed detection of 5&#8197;pm RNA within 100&#8197;min.







Abstract
Fluorogenic hybridization probes allow the detection of RNA and DNA sequences in homogeneous solution. Typically, one target molecule activates the fluorescence of a single probe molecule. This limits the sensitivity of nucleic acid detection. Herein, we report a self&#8208;immolative molecular beacon (iMB) that escapes the one&#8208;target/one&#8208;probe paradigm. The iMB probe includes a photoreductively cleavable N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;picolinium (NAP) linkage within the loop region. A fluorophore at the 5&#8217;&#8208;end serves, on the one hand, as a reporter group and, on the other hand, as a photosensitizer of a NAP&#8208;linker cleavage reaction. In the absence of target, the iMB adopts a hairpin shape. Quencher groups prevent photo&#8208;induced cleavage. The iMB opens upon hybridization with a target, and both fluorescent emission as well as photo&#8208;reductive cleavage of the NAP linker can occur. In contrast to previous chemical amplification reactions, iMBs are unimolecular probes that undergo cleavage leading to products that have lower target affinity than the probes before reaction. Aided by catalysis, the method allowed the detection of 5&#8197;pm RNA target within 100&#8197;min.

         <title>Multistimuli&#8208;Responsive [3]Dioxaphosphaferrocenophanes with Orthogonal Switches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A retro&#8208;style arcade machine needs an oxidant or a proton to be inserted to start playing and to switch the donating capabilities of novel phosphine ligands orthogonally and reversibly. Rh&#8208;catalysed hydrosilylation showed that these triggers can influence either the rate of conversion and/or the product distribution. The Japanese kanji for &#8220;iron&#8221; highlights the ferrocene moiety in the ligands&#8242; metal complexes. More information can be found in the Communication by F. Dielmann, F. Breher et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101969).

Cyclic d/l peptide nanotubes (CPNs) have diverse applications in biological and materials science. We study the impact of side chain alignment, hydrophobicity and charge on CPN stability and report crystal structures of non&#8208;tubular folded peptide conformations. Molecular dynamics simulations correlate with measured H&#8208;bond half&#8208;lives, showing how the composition and relative orientation of amino acids are key factors in CPN stability.







Abstract
Our understanding of the factors affecting the stability of cyclic d/l peptide (CP) nanotubes remains underdeveloped. In this work, we investigate the impact of side chain alignment, hydrophobicity and charge on CP nanotube stability through X&#8208;ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We characterise the distinct CP&#8208;CP alignments that can form and identify stable and unstable dimers by MD simulation. We measure H&#8208;bond half&#8208;lives of synthesised CPs by 1H&#8722;D exchange experiments and find good correlation with predicted CP&#8208;CP stabilities. We find that hydrophobic amino acids improve CP dimer stability but experimentally reduce solubility. Charged amino acids either increase or decrease CP dimer stability depending on the relative orientation and composition of charged groups. X&#8208;ray crystal structures are solved for two CPs, revealing non&#8208;tubular folded conformations. Ultimately, this work will assist the educated design of stable tubular structures for potential applications in biomedicine.

Suitable substitution: The synthesis of highly substituted six&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles using gold catalysis is reported. The applied cascade reaction using different substituted alkyne systems as starting materials furnished the corresponding benzo[c]phenanthridines in very high overall yields. In addition, two &#960;&#8208;extended molecules were studied as organic semiconductors in organic thin&#8208;film transistors.







Abstract
Herein, we describe a gold&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization of Boc&#8208;protected benzylamines bearing two tethered alkyne moieties in a domino reaction initiated by a 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization. The reaction was screened intensively, and the scope was explored, resulting in nine new Boc&#8208;protected dihydrobenzo[c]phenanthridines with yields of up to 98&#8201;%; even a &#960;&#8208;extension and two bidirectional approaches were successful. Furthermore, thermal cleavage of the Boc group and subsequent oxidation gave substituted benzo[c]phenanthridines in up to quantitative yields. Two bidirectional approaches under the optimized conditions were successful, and the resulting &#960;&#8208;extended molecules were tested as organic semiconductors in organic thin&#8208;film transistors.

         <title>The Stereoselective Oxidation of para&#8208;Substituted Benzenes by a Cytochrome P450 Biocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient and sustainable hydroxylation, epoxidation and sulfoxidation of a wide range of benzene derivatives using an engineered variant of a bacterial cytochrome P450 enzyme is reported. These reactions were catalyzed with high activity, regioselectivity and total turnover number (up to 20,000) and in certain instances these reactions were achieved with high enanatioselectivity (up to 98&#8201;% ee.).







Abstract
The serine 244 to aspartate (S244D) variant of the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP199A4 was used to expand its substrate range beyond benzoic acids. Substrates, in which the carboxylate group of the benzoic acid moiety is replaced were oxidised with high activity by the S244D mutant (product formation rates &gt;60&#8197;nmol.(nmol&#8208;CYP)&#8722;1.min&#8722;1) and with total turnover numbers of up to 20,000. Ethyl &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation was more rapid than methyl oxidation, styrene epoxidation and S&#8208;oxidation. The S244D mutant catalysed the ethyl hydroxylation, epoxidation and sulfoxidation reactions with an excess of one stereoisomer (in some instances up to &gt;98&#8201;%). The crystal structure of 4&#8208;methoxybenzoic acid&#8208;bound CYP199A4 S244D showed that the active site architecture and the substrate orientation were similar to that of the WT enzyme. Overall, this work demonstrates that CYP199A4 can catalyse the stereoselective hydroxylation, epoxidation or sulfoxidation of substituted benzene substrates under mild conditions resulting in more sustainable transformations using this heme monooxygenase enzyme.

         <title>Backbonding in Thorium(IV) and Uranium(IV) Diarsenido Complexes with tBuNC and CO</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rare phenomenon: A pronounced shift to lower frequency in the IR spectra of isostructural ThIV and UIV complexes of isocyanide and carbonyl indicates strong backbonding between the actinide and ligand. Quantum mechanical calculations show that charge transfer from an An&#8722;As &#963;&#8208;bond to the &#960;* orbital of the ligand is responsible for the strong donor&#8208;acceptor interaction.







Abstract
The coordination of tBuNC and CO with the diarsenido complexes (C5Me5)2An(&#951;2&#8208;As2Mes2), An=Th, U, has been investigated. For the first time, a comparison between isostructural complexes of ThIV and UIV has been possible with CO; density functional calculations indicated an appreciable amount of &#960; backbonding that originates from charge transfer from an actinide&#8208;arsenic sigma bond. The calculated CO stretching frequencies in the ThIV and UIV diarsenido complexes are consistent with the experimental measurements, both show large shifts to lower frequency. We demonstrate that the &#960; backbonding is crucial to explaining the red shifts of CO frequency upon AnIV complex formation. Interestingly, this interaction essentially correlates to the parallel orientation of &#960;*(C&#8722;O) orbitals relative to the An&#8722;As bond.

         <title>Amine&#8208;Directed Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Halogenation of Phenylalanine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A site&#8208;selective, primary amine (as a native NH2 functionality)&#8208;directed, palladium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H halogenation (X=I, Br, Cl) of phenylalanine platforms is demonstrated. Efficient and versatile, this strategy paves the way to constructing a large array of original halogenated phenylalanine derivatives as nonproteinogenic AAs.







Abstract
An efficient primary&#8208;amine&#8208;directed, palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H halogenation (X=I, Br, Cl) of phenylalanine derivatives is reported on a range of quaternary amino acid (AA) derivatives thanks to suitable conditions employing trifluoroacetic acid as additive. The extension of this original native functionality&#8208;directed ortho&#8208;selective halogenation was even demonstrated with the more challenging native phenylalanine as tertiary AA.

         <title>Investigation of Masked N&#8208;Acyl&#8208;N&#8208;isocyanates: Support for Oxadiazolones as Blocked N&#8208;Isocyanate Precursors</title>

Masked synthesis: N&#8208;isocyanates are reactive intermediates and their N&#8208;acyl derivatives, amido&#8208;isocyanates, are rare. Herein, their synthesis and reactivity are studied, supporting that under suitable conditions the amido&#8208;isocyanate is in equilibrium with the parent oxadiazolone. Reactions with amino&#8208;amides as nucleophiles form nitrogen&#8208;rich products, either aza&#8208;tripeptides or their parent hydantoins. Support for an isocyanate intermediate was also obtained using carboxylate ions as nucleophiles, affording N&#8208;acylhydrazides.







Abstract
In contrast to carbon&#8208;substituted isocyanates that are common building blocks, N&#8208;substituted isocyanates remain underdeveloped and reports on their N&#8208;acyl derivatives (i.&#8201;e. amido&#8208;isocyanates) are exceedingly rare. Herein, amido&#8208;isocyanates were investigated in the context of syntheses of aza&#8208;tripeptide and hydantoins subunits starting from simple bench&#8208;stable precursors. A key finding is that the amido&#8208;isocyanate formed in&#8197;situ cyclized to yield an oxadiazolone, and that under suitable reaction conditions this heterocycle is a traceless blocked (masked) N&#8208;isocyanate. Using organic bases as catalysts and upon heating, oxadiazolone formation is observed, and various nucleophiles to provide the desired aza&#8208;dipeptides or hydantoins in moderate to high yields. Further support for an amido&#8208;isocyanate intermediate was obtained using carboxylic acids as nucleophiles, affording N&#8208;acylhydrazide products.

         <title>Lateral Metallation and Redistribution Reactions of Sodium Ferrates Containing Bulky 2,6&#8208;Diisopropyl&#8208;N&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)anilide Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Influenced by the large steric demands imposed by the 2,6&#8208;diisopropyl&#8208;N&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)anilide ligand, N(SiMe3)Dipp, new examples of chemical cooperativity on sodium ferrates have been disclosed. This includes: (a) the chemoselective ferration of pentafluorobenzene by a heteroleptic tris(amido) sodium ferrate; and, (b) the lateral metallation of a N(SiMe3)Dipp group at one Me of its SiMe3 substituent when attempting the co&#8208;complexation of the sodium and iron (II) single&#8208;metal amides.







Abstract
Alkali&#8208;metal ferrates containing amide groups have emerged as regioselective bases capable of promoting Fe&#8722;H exchanges of aromatic substrates. Advancing this area of heterobimetallic chemistry, a new series of sodium ferrates is introduced incorporating the bulky arylsilyl amido ligand N(SiMe3)(Dipp) (Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3). Influenced by the large steric demands imposed by this amide, transamination of [NaFe(HMDS)3] (HMDS=N(SiMe3)2) with an excess of HN(SiMe3)(Dipp) led to the isolation of heteroleptic [Na(HMDS)2Fe{N(SiMe3)Dipp}]&#8734; (1) resulting from the exchange of just one HMDS group. An alternative co&#8208;complexation approach, combining the homometallic metal amides [NaN(SiMe3)Dipp] and [Fe{N(SiMe3)Dipp}2] induces lateral metallation of one Me arm from the SiMe3 group in the iron amide furnishing tetrameric [NaFe{N(SiCH2Me2)Dipp}{N(SiMe3)Dipp}]4 (2). Reactivity studies support that this deprotonation is driven by the steric incompatibility of the single metal amides rather than the basic capability of the sodium reagent. Displaying synergistic reactivity, heteroleptic sodium ferrate 1 can selectively promote ferration of pentafluorobenzene using one of its HMDS arms to give heterotrileptic [Na{N(SiMe3)Dipp}(HMDS)Fe(C6F5)]&#8734; (4). Attempts to deprotonate less activated pyridine led to the isolation of NaHMDS and heteroleptic Fe(II) amide [(py)Fe{N(SiMe3)Dipp}(HMDS)] (5), resulting from an alternative redistribution process which is favoured by the Lewis donor ability of this substrate.

         <title>Sequential Hydrogen Tunneling in o&#8208;Tolylmethylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Who is first? Conformer specificity, although rarely evidenced, is expected to play a crucial role in tunneling reactions. [1,4] hydrogen transfer in o&#8208;tolylmethylene is a puzzling example in this respect, as the apparent rate constants do not differ for the two conformers. Our structural, kinetic, and energetic analyses demonstrate that conformer specificity is disguised by a rotational tunneling pre&#8208;equilibrium.







Abstract
o&#8208;Tolylmethylene 1 is a metastable triplet carbene that rearranges to o&#8208;xylylene 2 even at temperatures as low as 2.7&#8197;K via [1,4] H atom tunneling. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopical techniques were used to identify two conformers of 1 (anti and syn) in noble gas matrices and in frozen organic solutions. Conformer&#8208;specific kinetic measurements revealed that the rate constants for the rearrangements of the anti and syn conformers of 1 are very similar. However, the orbital alignment in the syn conformer is less favorable for the hydrogen transfer reaction than the orbital configuration in the anti conformer. Our spectroscopic and quantum chemical investigations indicate that anti 1 and syn 1 rapidly interconvert via efficient quantum tunneling forming a rotational pre&#8208;equilibrium. The subsequent second tunneling reaction, the [1,4] H migration from anti 1 to 2, is rate&#8208;limiting for the formation of 2. We here present an efficient strategy for the study of such tunneling equilibria.

         <title>CD Stretching Modes are Sensitive to the Microenvironment in Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Knowledge of the structure of the electrical double layer in ionic liquids is crucial for their applications in electrochemical technologies. We report the synthesis and applicability of an imidazolium&#8208;based amphiphilic ionic liquid with a perdeuterated alkyl chain for studies of electric potential&#8208;dependent rearrangements, and changes in the microenvironment in a monolayer on a Au(111) surface. Electrochemical measurements show two states of the organization of ions on the electrode surface. In situ IR spectroscopy shows that the alkyl chains in imidazolium cations change their orientation depending on the adsorption state. The methylene&#8208;  d  2  stretching modes in the perdeuterated SAIL display a reversible, potential&#8208;dependent appearance of a new band. The presence of this mode also depends on the anion in the SAIL. Supported by quantum chemical calculations, this new mode is assigned to a second n  as  (CD  2  ) band in alkyl&#8208;chain fragments embedded in a polar environment of the anions/solvent present in the vicinity of the imidazolium cation and electrode. It is a measure of the potential&#8208;dependent segregation between polar and non&#8208;polar environments in the layers of a SAIL closest to the electrode.</dc:description>

         <title>Hetero&#8208;bimetallic Lanthanide&#8208;Coinage Metal Compounds Featuring Possible Metal&#8208;Metal Interactions in the Excited State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rare interactions for rare earths: The trivalent lanthanide compounds [dpfam3Ln] (Ln&#160;=&#160;La, Nd, dpfam&#160;=&#160;N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis[(2&#8208;diphenylphosphino)phenyl]formamidinate) were used as scaffold to incorporate Ag+ and Au+ ions, resulting in the hetero&#8208;bimetallic compounds [dpfam3LnM][OTf]. The compounds were investigated by photoluminescence spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations, of which the latter showed rare La&#8722;Au interactions for the first excited state.







Abstract
Heterometallic complexes, combining metals of the outer rims of the d&#8208;block, for example lanthanides(III) (Ln) and coinage metals(I) (M) are scarcely reported, synthetically challenging and highly interesting in terms of their interactions. In this context, we synthesized hetero&#8208;bimetallic Ln&#8722;M compounds ligated by the phosphine functionalized amidinate system (N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis[(2&#8208;diphenylphosphino)phenyl]formamidinate, &#8220;dpfam&#8221;). The resulting compounds [dpfam3LnM][OTf] (Ln&#160;=&#160;La, Nd and M&#160;=&#160;Ag, Au) feature a close proximity of the two metal centres and were investigated experimentally by photoluminescence spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. The latter showed rare La&#8722;Au interactions for the first excited state.

         <title>Electrochemical studies of CO2&#8208;reducing metalloenzymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Only two enzymes are capable of directly reducing CO2  : the CO dehydrogenase, which produces CO at a [NiFe4S4  ] active site, and the formate dehydrogenase, which produces formate at a W/Mo active site. Both metalloenzymes are very rapid, energy&#8208;efficient and specific in terms of product. They have been connected to electrodes with two different objectives. A series of studies used protein film electrochemistry to learn about different aspects of the reactivity of these enzymes (reactivity with substrates, inhibitors&#8230;). Another series focused on taking advantage of the catalytic performance of these enzymes to build biotechnological devices, from CO2&#8208;reducing electrodes to full photochemical devices performing artificial photosynthesis. Here, we review all these works.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering of Silicon Core&#8208;shell Structures for Li&#8208;ion Anodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The amount of silicon in anode materials for Li&#8208;ion batteries is still limited by the huge volume changes during charge&#8208;discharge cycles. Such changes lead to the loss of electrical contacts, as well as mechanical and surface electrolyte interphase (SEI) instabilities, strongly reducing the cycle life. Core&#8208;shell structures have attracted a vast research interest due to the possibility of modifying some properties with a judicious choice of the shell. It is, for example, possible to improve the electronic conductivity and ionic diffusion, or buffer volume variations. This review gives a comprehensive overview of the recent developments and the different strategies used for the design, synthesis and electrochemical performance of silicon&#8208;based core&#8208;shells. It is based on a selection of the main types of silicon coatings reported in the literature, including carbon, inorganic, organic and double&#8208;layer coatings, Finally, a summary of the advantages and drawbacks of these different types of core&#8208;shells as anode materials for Li&#8208;ion batteries and some insightful suggestions in regards to their use are provided.</dc:description>

         <title>Morphology Dependent Peroxidase Mimicking Enzyme Activity of Copper Metal&#8211;Organic Polyhedra Assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The morphology of nanomaterials (geometric shape and dimension) play a significant role in its various physical and chemical properties. Thus, it is essential to link morphology with performance in specific applications. For this purpose, the morphology of copper metal&#8208;organic polyhedra&#160;(Cu&#8208;MOP) can be modulated through distinct assemble process, which facilitates the exploration of the relationship between morphology and catalytic performance. In this work, the assemblies of Cu&#8208;MOP with three different morphologies (nanorods, nanofibers and nanosheets) were facilely prepared by the variation of solvent mixture of N, N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) and methanol, revealed the important role of the interaction between the surface group and the solvent on the morphology of these assemblies. Cu&#8208;MOP nanofibers exhibited the highest mimetic peroxidase enzyme activity over the Cu&#8208;MOP nanosheets and nanorods, which have been utilized in the detection of glucose. Cu&#8208;MOPs assemblies with tunable morphology accompanied with adjustable mimic peroxidase activity, had great potential applications in the field of bioanalytical chemistry and biomedicals.</dc:description>

         <title>The photophysics and photochemistry of melanin&#8208; like nanomaterials depend on morphology and structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Melanin&#8208;like nanomaterials have found application in a large variety of high economic and social impact fields as medicine, energy conversion and storage, photothermal catalysis and environmental remediation. These materials have been used mostly for their optical and electronic properties, but also for their high biocompatibility and simplicity and versatility of preparation. Beside this, their chemistry is complex and it yields structures with different molecular weight and composition ranging from oligomer, to polymer as well as nanoparticles (NP). The comprehension of the correlation of the different compositions and morphologies to the optical properties of melanin is still incomplete and challenging, even if it is fundamental also from technological point of view. In this minireview we focus on scientific papers, mostly recent ones, that indeed examine the link between composition and structural feature and photophysical and photochemical properties proposing this approach as a general one for future research.</dc:description>

         <title>Macrocyclic Inorganic Tin Containing Oxo Clusters: Heterometallic Strategy for Configuration and Catalytic Activity Modulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we report the first examples of inorganic macrocyclic tin&#8208;oxo clusters which are stabilized by sulfate ligands. As determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction and photoelectron spectroscopy analyses, the prepared inorganic Sn10&#8208;oxo cluster displays interesting mixed valence behaviors, with 8 Sn4+ located at the cyclic skeleton and two Sn2+ encapsulated in the center. When further introducing Ti4+ and In3+ ions to the synthetic systems, heterometallic Sn2Ti6 and SnIn5Ti6 complexes with Ti6(SO4)9 and SnIn5(SO4)12 macrocyclic skeletons were prepared whose configuration and packing models were affected by the ionic radius of incorporated metals. Moreover, comparative CO2 reduction experiments confirm that such heterometallic composition can significantly improve the catalytic activities of these inorganic macrocyclic oxo clusters. This work represents a milestone in constructing inorganic tin complexes and also macrocyclic metal oxo clusters with tunable configurations and properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Continuous Flow Acylation of (Hetero)aryllithiums with Polyfunctional N,N&#8208;Dimethylamides and Tetramethylurea in Toluene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N,N&#8208;Dimethylamides for continuous flow acylations: A new acylation of (hetero)aryllithiums with polyfunctional and enolizable N,N&#8208;dimethylamides in toluene in continuous flow was reported. The required lithium species was prepared at 25&#8201;&#176;C from (hetero)aryl bromides and sec&#8208;BuLi in toluene. Additionally, a new telescoped procedure, using tetramethylurea as C1&#8208;building block, was described providing highly functionalized unsymmetrical ketones.







Abstract
The continuous flow reaction of various aryl or heteroaryl bromides in toluene in the presence of THF (1.0&#8197;equiv) with sec&#8208;BuLi (1.1&#8197;equiv) provided at 25&#8201;&#176;C within 40&#8197;sec the corresponding aryllithiums which were acylated with various functionalized N,N&#8208;dimethylamides including easily enolizable amides at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C within 27&#8197;sec, producing highly functionalized ketones in 48&#8211;90&#8201;% yield (36 examples). This method was well suited for the preparation of &#945;&#8208;chiral ketones such as naproxene and ibuprofen derived ketones with 99&#8201;% ee. A one&#8208;pot stepwise bis&#8208;addition of two different lithium organometallics to 1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethyurea (TMU) provided unsymmetrical ketones in 69&#8211;79&#8201;% yield (9 examples).

         <title>Self&#8208;Propelling Hybrid Gels Incorporating an Active Self&#8208;Assembled, Low&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight Gelator</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Motion capture: Gel beads that incorporate a self&#8208;assembled low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelator (LMWG) into an agarose polymer gel particle are reported; when loaded with ethanol and placed in water, they self&#8208;propel as a result of the Marangoni effect. The presence of the LMWG significantly increases their mobility and endows them with unique functions, such as enhanced ability to adsorb a pollutant dye.







Abstract
Hybrid gel beads based on combining a low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelator (LMWG) with a polymer gelator (PG) demonstrate an enhanced ability to self&#8208;propel in water, with the LMWG playing an active role. Hybrid gel beads were loaded with ethanol and shown to move in water owing to the Marangoni effect changes in surface tension caused by the expulsion of ethanol &#8211; smaller beads move farther and faster than larger beads. Flat shapes of the hybrid gel were cut using a &#8220;stamp&#8221; &#8211; circles moved the furthest, whereas stars showed more rotation on their own axes. Comparing hybrid LMWG/PG gel beads with PG&#8208;only beads demonstrated that the LMWG speeds up the beads, enhancing the rate of self&#8208;propulsion. Self&#8208;assembly of the LMWG into a &#8220;solid&#8208;like&#8221; network prevents its leaching from the gel. The LMWG also retains its own unique function &#8211; specifically, remediating methylene blue pollutant dye from basic water as a result of noncovalent interactions. The mobile hybrid beads accumulate this dye more effectively than PG&#8208;only beads. Self&#8208;propelling gel beads have potential applications in removal/delivery of active agents in environmental or biological settings. The ability of self&#8208;assembling LMWGs to enhance mobility and control removal/delivery suggests that adding them to self&#8208;propelling systems can add significant value.

         <title>Contorted Heteroannulated Tetraareno[a,d,j,m]coronenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tuning tetraarenocoronenes: Cata&#8208;condensed heteroannulated tetraarenocoronenes with C2h symmetry have been obtained from three doubly brominated diarenoperylenes. X&#8208;ray diffraction showed that the coronenes mostly adopt S&#8208;shaped contorted &#960;&#8208;planes. The large variety of fused rings in the coronenes&#8242; core allows good control of their photophysical properties and thus their potential use in organic electronics applications.







Abstract
Fused polycyclic aromatic compounds are interesting materials for organic electronics applications. To fine&#8208;tune photophysical or electrochemical properties, either various substituents can be attached or heteroatoms (such as N or S) can be incorporated into the fused aromatic backbone. Coronenes and heterocoronenes are promising compounds in this respect. Up until now, the possibilities for varying the attached fused heteroaromatics at the coronene core were quite limited, and realizing both electron&#8208;withdrawing and &#8208;donating rings at the same time was very difficult. Here, a series of pyridine, anisole and thiophene annulated tetraareno[a,d,j,m]coronenes has been synthesized by a facile two&#8208;step route that is a combination of Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling and a following cyclization step, starting from three different diarenoperylene dibromides. The contorted molecular &#960;&#8208;planes of the obtained cata&#8208;condensed tetraarenocoronenes were analyzed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography, and the photophysical and electrochemical properties were systematically investigated by UV/Vis spectroscopy and cyclovoltammetry.

Up until now, the possibilities for varying the attached fused heteroaromatics at the coronene core were quite limited, and realizing both electron-withdrawing and -donating rings at the same time was very difficult. Here, a series of pyridine, anisole and thiophene annulated tetraareno[&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;j&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;]coronenes has been synthesized by a facile two-step route that is a combination of Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling and a following cyclization step, starting from three different diarenoperylene dibromides. The contorted molecular &#960;-planes of the obtained &lt;i&gt;cata&lt;/i&gt;-condensed tetraarenocoronenes were analyzed by single-crystal X-ray crystallography, and the photophysical and electrochemical properties were systematically investigated by UV/Vis spectroscopy and cyclovoltammetry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Small&#8208;Molecule Diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;Based Dye for in&#8197;vivo NIR&#8208;IIa Fluorescence Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the small&#8208;molecule DPP&#8208;based fluorophore T25 with NIR&#8208;II and NIR&#8208;IIa emission, T25@F127 were selected for fluorescence angiography and cerebral vascular microscopic imaging of mice with nearly 800&#8197;&#956;m penetrating depth and excellent signal&#8208;background ratio of 4.07 and 2.26 (at 250 and 400&#8197;&#956;m), respectively. Furthermore, T25@cRGD with tumor targeting ability could image tiny metastatic tumor on intestine with a small size of 0.3&#8197;mm&#215;1.0&#8197;mm.







Abstract
Organic small&#8208;molecule fluorophores with near&#8208;infrared IIa (NIR&#8208;IIa) emission have great potential in pre&#8208;clinical detection and inoperative imaging due to the high&#8208;spatial resolution and deep penetration. However, developments of the NIR&#8208;IIa fluorophores are still facing considerable challenges. In this work, a series of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)&#8208;based fluorophores were designed and synthesized. Subsequently, nanomaterial T25@F127 with significant NIR&#8208;IIa emission properties was rationally prepared by encapsulating DPP&#8208;based fluorophore T25, and was selected for fluorescence angiography and cerebral vascular microscopic imaging with nearly 800&#8197;&#956;m penetrating depth and excellent signal&#8208;background ratio of 4.07 and 2.26 (at 250 and 400&#8197;&#956;m), respectively. Furthermore, the nanomaterial T25@cRGD with tumor targeting ability can image tiny metastatic tumor on intestine with a small size of 0.3&#8197;mm&#215;1.0&#8197;mm and high&#8208;spatial resolution (SBR=3.84). This study demonstrates that the nanomaterials which encapsulated T25 behave as excellent NIR&#8208;IIa fluorescence imaging agents and have a great potential for in&#8197;vivo biological application.

         <dc:description>A method for the selective tryptophan modification and labelling of tryptophan&#8208;containing peptides is described. Photoirradiation of acylsilanes generates reactive siloxycarbenes which undergo H&#173;&#8211;N&#8208;insertion into the indole moiety of tryptophan to give stable silyl protected hemiaminals. This method is successfully applied to chemically modify various tryptophan containing oligopeptides. The method enables the selective introduction of alkynes to peptides that are eligible for further alkyne&#8208;azide click chemistry. In addition, the dansyl fluorophore can be conjugated to a peptide using this approach.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Catalytic Performance of Quasi&#8208;HKUST&#8208;1&#8201;for the Tandem Imine Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Controlled thermolysis of HKUST&#8208;1 produces the partial removal of ligands, the generation of structural defects and additional porosity in a controlled way. The resulting defective materials denoted according to the literature as quasi&#8208;MOFs, were subsequently employed as catalyst for one pot imine synthesis by cross coupling of alcohols with amines.







Abstract
Copper&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (Cu3(BTC)2(H2O)3]n&#8901;nH2OMeOH (HKUST&#8208;1) has been subjected to thermolysis under air atmosphere at different temperatures ranging from 100 to 300&#8201;&#176;C. This treatment produces the partial removal of ligands, the generation of structural defects and additional porosity in a controlled way. The resulting defective materials denoted according to the literature as quasi&#8208;MOFs, were subsequently employed as heterogeneous catalysts in the one pot synthesis of N&#8208;benzylideneaniline from aniline and benzyl alcohol in open air as terminal oxidant at 70&#8201;&#176;C under base&#8208; and dehydrating agent&#8208;free conditions. The Q&#8208;HKUST catalysts calcined at 240&#8201;&#176;C (QH&#8208;240) was the most efficient in the series, promoting imine synthesis. Data from Knoevenagel condensation of malononitrile shows that in QH&#8208;240 the distances of Cu ions in HKUST&#8208;1 cavities are preserved, increasing the Knoevenagel activity, but a strong rearrangement takes place at 300&#8201;&#176;C or above. The unsaturated copper active sites with simultaneous presence of micro&#8208; and mesopores in QH&#8208;240 are responsible for this excellent catalytic performance. The effective parameters on catalytic activity of QH&#8208;240 including deligandation temperature, the amount of catalyst, the ratio of reactants, and reaction temperature as well as the stability and recyclability of the catalyst were also investigated. The possible mechanism used by QH&#8208;240 follows alcohol aerobic oxidation and subsequent anaerobic condensation of aldehyde intermediate with aniline.

         <dc:description>The interaction of molecules, especially hydrocarbons, at the gas/ionic liquid (IL) surface plays a crucial role in supported IL catalysis. The dynamics of this process is investigated by measuring the trapping probabilities of  n&#8208;  butane,  iso&#8208;  butane and 1&#8209;butene on a set of frozen 1&#8209;alkyl&#8208;3&#8209;methylimidazolium&#8208;based ILs [C  n  C  1  Im]X, where  n  =&#160;4, 8 and X  &#8208;  =&#160;Cl  &#8208;  , Br  &#8208;  , [PF  6  ]  &#8208;  and [Tf  2  N]  &#8208;  . The decrease of the initial trapping probability with increasing surface temperature is used to determine the desorption energy of the hydrocarbons at the IL surfaces. It increases with increasing alkyl chain length  n  and decreasing anion size for the ILs studied. We attribute these effects to different degrees of alkyl chain surface enrichment, while interactions between the adsorbate and the anion do not play a significant role. The adsorption energy also depends on the adsorbing molecule: It decreases in the order  n  &#8208;butane &gt; 1&#8209;butene &gt;  iso&#8208;  butane, which can be explained by different dispersion interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>The introduction of a cysteine residue modulates the mechanical properties of aromatic&#8208;based solid aggregates and self&#8208;supporting hydrogels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptide&#8208;based hydrogels, originated by multiscale self&#8208;assembling phenomenon, have been proposed as multivalent tools in different technological areas. Structural studies and molecular dynamics simulations pointed out the capability of completely aromatic peptides to gelificate if hydrophilic and hydrophobic forces are opportunely balanced. Here we evaluated the effect produced by the introduction of a Cys residue in the heteroaromatic sequence of (FY)3 and in its PEGylated variant. The physicochemical characterization indicates that both FYFCFYF and PEG8&#8208;FYFCFYF are able to self&#8208;assemble in supramolecular nanostructures whose basic cross&#8208;&#946; motif resembles the one detected in the ancestor (FY)3 assemblies. However, gelification occurs only for FYFCFYF at a concentration of 1.5 wt%. After cross&#8208;linking of cysteine residues, the hydrogel undergoes to an improvement of the rigidity compared to the parent (FY)3 assemblies as suggested by the storage modulus (G&#8217;) that increases from 970 to 3360 Pa. The mechanical properties of FYFCFYF are compatible with its potential application in bone tissue regeneration.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Peptide-based hydrogels, originated by multiscale self-assembling phenomenon, have been proposed as multivalent tools in different technological areas. Structural studies and molecular dynamics simulations pointed out the capability of completely aromatic peptides to gelificate if hydrophilic and hydrophobic forces are opportunely balanced. Here we evaluated the effect produced by the introduction of a Cys residue in the heteroaromatic sequence of (FY)3 and in its PEGylated variant. The physicochemical characterization indicates that both FYFCFYF and PEG8-FYFCFYF are able to self-assemble in supramolecular nanostructures whose basic cross-&#946; motif resembles the one detected in the ancestor (FY)3 assemblies. However, gelification occurs only for FYFCFYF at a concentration of 1.5 wt%. After cross-linking of cysteine residues, the hydrogel undergoes to an improvement of the rigidity compared to the parent (FY)3 assemblies as suggested by the storage modulus (G&#8217;) that increases from 970 to 3360 Pa. The mechanical properties of FYFCFYF are compatible with its potential application in bone tissue regeneration. Moreover, the avalaibility of a Cys residue in the middle of the peptide sequence could allow the hydrogel derivatization with targeting moieties or with biologically relevant molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Catalytic Mechanism of the Retaining Glycosyltransferase Mannosylglycerate Synthase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mannosylglycerate synthase from the extremophile Rhodothermus marinus is a retaining glycosyltransferase able to synthesize a variety of small negatively charged molecules called compatible solutes. These molecules confer protection against extreme conditions such as extremely high or low temperatures, pH, and high salinity. Therefore, it has exciting potential biotechnological applications.







Abstract
To protect their intracellular proteins, extremophile microorganisms synthesize molecules called compatible solutes. These molecules are the result of the attachment of a small negatively charged molecule to a sugar molecule. It has been found that these molecules, not only protect the microorganism against osmotic stress but also against other extreme conditions. They can also confer protection against extreme conditions to isolated enzymes from different organisms making them an exciting prospect for potential biotechnological applications. One of the most widespread compatible solute in hyperthermophile organisms is the molecule 2&#8208;O&#8208;&#945;&#8208;D&#8208;mannosyl&#8208;D&#8208;glycerate (MG). In addition to confer protection to proteins against extreme conditions, MG was found to prevent Alzheimer's &#946;&#8208;amyloid aggregation and reduce &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibril formation in Parkinson's disease. In this work we studied, using computational methods, the catalytic mechanism of the synthesis of MG by the enzyme mannosylglycerate synthase (MGS) from the thermophilic bacteria Rhodothermus marinus.

         <title>Structure Recovery and Recycling of Used LiCoO2 Cathode Material</title>

         <dc:description>
Repair and reuse: The recovery of waste LiCoO2 material is realized by the combination of industrial machinery process and small&#8208;scale equipment repair technology. The results showed that the crystal structure of the material was repaired with the excellent electrochemical performance.







Abstract
A large number of lithium batteries have been retiring from the market of energy storage. Thus, recycling of the used electrode materials is becoming urgent. In this study, an industrial machinery processing was used to recover the crystal structure of the waste LiCoO2 materials with the combination of small&#8208;scale equipment repair technology. The results show that the crystal parameters of the repaired LiCoO2 material become small, the unit cell volume is reduced, and the crystal structure tends to be stable. The Co&#8722;O bond length of 1.9134&#8197;nm, O&#8722;Co&#8722;O bond angle of 94.72&#176;, the (003) interplanar spacing of 0.467&#8197;nm indicate the excellent recovery level of the repaired LiCoO2. In addition, the electrochemical performance of the repaired LiCoO2 material is greatly improved, compared with the waste material. The capacity of the repaired electrode material can be maintained at 120&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 100 cycles at the current density of 0.2C. The promising rate performance of the repaired electrode material demonstrates the stable structure. This research work provides a large&#8208;scale method for the direct recovery of LiCoO2 with the reduction of unnecessary energy and reagent consumption, which will be beneficial to the environmental protection.

         <title>Atypical and Asymmetric 1,3&#8208;P,N Ligands: Synthesis, Coordination and Catalytic Performance of Cycloiminophosphanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complexes, chirality and catalysts: 1,3&#8208;P,N hybrid ligands are broadly applied in cooperative catalysis, but show limited electronic variation. We report novel analogues with a high N&#8208;basicity, based on 7&#8208;membered cyclic imines. Their transition metal complexes demonstrated their donor strength (W), hemilabile coordination (Rh), and catalytic activity for nitrile hydration (Ru) and transfer hydrogenation (Ru, Ir). Chiral derivatives were also obtained, synthesized from l&#8208;menthone.







Abstract
Novel seven&#8208;membered cyclic imine&#8208;based 1,3&#8208;P,N ligands were obtained by capturing a Beckmann nitrilium ion intermediate generated in situ from cyclohexanone with benzotriazole, and then displacing it by a secondary phosphane under triflic acid promotion. These &#8220;cycloiminophosphanes&#8221; possess flexible non&#8208;isomerizable tetrahydroazepine rings with a high basicity; this sets them apart from previously reported iminophophanes. The donor strength of the ligands was investigated by using their P&#8208;&#954;1&#8208; and P,N&#8208;&#954;2&#8208;tungsten(0) carbonyl complexes, by determining the IR frequency of the trans&#8208;CO ligands. Complexes with [RhCp*Cl2]2 demonstrated the hemilability of the ligands, giving a dynamic equilibrium of &#954;1 and &#954;2 species; treatment with AgOTf gives full conversion to the &#954;2 complex. The potential for catalysis was shown in the RuII&#8208;catalyzed, solvent&#8208;free hydration of benzonitrile and the RuII&#8208; and IrI&#8208;catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of cyclohexanone in isopropanol. Finally, to enable access to asymmetric catalysts, chiral cycloiminophosphanes were prepared from l&#8208;menthone, as well as their P,N&#8208;&#954;2&#8208;RhIII and a P&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;RuII complexes.

         <dc:description>Despite recent advances, trifluoromethoxylation remains a challenging reaction. Here we describe an efficient trifluoromethoxylative substitution, using an inexpensive and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle reagent. By mixing DMAP with a slight excess of 1,4&#8208;dinitro&#8208;trifluoromethoxybenzene (DNTFB), a stable solution of trifluoromethoxide anion is obtained and can be used to perform a SN2 reaction without any silver additives. A precise study of the properties and behavior of this unusual stable solution of CF3O&#8208; species is also performed.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Oligonucleotides Containing Trans Mitomycin C DNA Adducts at N6 of Adenine and N2 of Guanine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A route to access modified oligonucleotides containing trans dA monoadducts produced from the reaction between mitomycin C and DNA is presented. Parent oligonucleotides containing a trans dG monoadduct and a trans dG&#8208;MC&#8208;dG ICL were also produced. The stability and spectral properties of all substrates were compared and virtual models were created to explore the conformational space and structural features of these MC&#8208;DNA complexes.







Abstract
Mitomycin C, (MC), an antitumor drug, is a DNA alkylating agent currently used in the clinics. Inert in its native form, MC is reduced to reactive mitosenes, which undergo nucleophilic attack by guanine or adenine bases in DNA to form monoadducts as well as interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). Although ICLs are considered the most cytotoxic lesions, the role of each individual adduct in the drug's cytotoxicity is still not fully understood. Synthetic routes have been developed to access modified oligonucleotides containing dG MC&#8208;monoadducts and dG&#8208;MC&#8208;dG ICL at a single position of their base sequences to investigate the biological effects of these adducts. However, until now, oligonucleotides containing monoadducts formed by MC at the adenine base had not been available, thus preventing the examination of the role played by these lesions in the toxicity of MC. Here, we present a route to access these substrates. Structural proof of the adducted oligonucleotides were provided by enzymatic digestion to nucleosides and high&#8208;resolution mass spectral analysis. Additionally, parent oligonucleotides containing a dG monoadduct and a dG&#8208;MC&#8208;dG ICL were also produced. The stability and physical properties of all substrates were compared via CD spectroscopy and UV melting temperature studies. Finally, virtual models were created to explore the conformational space and structural features of these MC&#8208;DNA complexes.

         <title>Monocyclometalated (C&#8201;N) Gold(III) Metallacycles: Tunable Emission and Singlet Oxygen (1O2) Generation Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold(III) metallacycles. Monocyclometalated gold(III) metallacycles with tunable emission properties have been demonstrated. The complexes show highly emissive triplet excited states (T1) with long excited state lifetimes. The T1 of the complexes and the triplet excited state of dioxygen (3O2) lie in a delicate balance resulting in an efficient quenching of these triplet states to generate 1O2. The first use case of monocyclometalated gold(III) complexes to generate 1O2 photochemically is demonstrated.







Abstract
The synthesis, characterization and photoluminescent properties of four cyclometalated (C&#8201;N)&#8208;type gold(III) complexes bearing a bidentate diacetylide ligand, tolan&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;diacetylide (tda), are reported. The complexes exhibit highly tunable excited state properties and show photoluminescence (PL) across the entire visible spectrum from sky&#8208;blue (&#955;PL=493&#8197;nm) to red (&#955;PL=675&#8197;nm) with absolute PL quantum yields (PLQY) of up to 75&#8201;% in solution, the highest PLQY found for any monocyclometalated Au(III) complex in solution. As a consequence of the use of the strongly rigidifying diacetylide bidentate ligand, a significant increase in the excited state lifetimes (&#964;0=16&#8211;258 &#956;s) was found in solution and in thin films. The complexes showed remarkable singlet oxygen generation in aerated solution with absolute singlet oxygen quantum yield (&#981;1&#916;) values reaching up to 7.5&#215;10&#8722;5 and singlet oxygen lifetimes (&#964;01&#916;) in the range of 66&#8211;95 &#956;s. Furthermore, the radiative and non&#8208;radiative rates of singlet oxygen were determined using the &#981;1&#916; and &#964;01&#916; values and correlations are drawn between the formation of singlet oxygen and its interaction with cyclometalated (C&#8201;N) gold(III) complexes.

         <title>Diazophosphonates: Effective Surrogates for Diazoalkanes in Pyrazole Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starring in a triple role&#8230; Diazophosphonates are excellent 1,3&#8208;dipoles in both inter&#8208; and intramolecular cycloadditions with alkynes to give N&#8208;H pyrazoles. The phosphoryl group has three key roles: its electron&#8208;withdrawing nature stabilizes the diazo compound, its unexploited propensity to migrate readily in sigmatropic rearrangements facilitates its transfer from C to N in the initial cycloadduct, and hence it is easily removed from the final pyrazole product.







Abstract
Diazophosphonates, readily prepared from &#945;&#8208;ketophosphonates by oxidation of the corresponding hydrazones in batch or in flow, are useful partners in 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reactions to alkynes to give N&#8208;H pyrazoles, including the first intramolecular examples of such a process. The phosphoryl group imbues a number of desirable properties into the diazo 1,3&#8208;dipole. The electron&#8208;withdrawing nature of the phosphoryl stabilizes the diazo compound making it easier to handle, whilst the ability of the phosphoryl group to migrate readily in a [1,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement enables its transfer from C to N to aromatize the initial cycloadduct, and hence its facile removal from the final pyrazole product. Overall, the diazophosphonate acts as a surrogate for the much less stable diazoalkane in cycloadditions, with the phosphoryl group playing a vital, but traceless, role. The cycloaddition proceeds more readily with alkynes bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, and is regiospecific with asymmetrical alkynes. The potential of diazophosphonates for use in bioorthogonal cycloadditions is demonstrated by their facile addition to strained alkynes.

         <title>Platinum Indolylphosphine Fluorido and Polyfluorido Complexes: An Interplay between Cyclometallation, Fluoride Migration, and Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorine on Skatole's scent. Tetramethylammoniumfluoride permits the twofold cyclometallation of 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;indolylphosphine ligands at platinum(ii) complexes. Hydrogen fluoride opens the cyclometallation yielding a unique Pt(ii) complex which exhibits hydrogen&#8208;bonding to the fluorido ligand in its outer coordination sphere. The fluorido complex reacts with an ynamide to give an exceptional metal bound oxazole derivative.







Abstract
The reaction of [PtCl2(COD)] (COD=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene) with diisopropyl&#8208;2&#8208;(3&#8208;methyl)indolylphosphine (iPr2P(C9H8N)) led to the formation of the platinum(ii) chlorido complexes, cis&#8208;[PtCl2{iPr2P(C9H8N)}2] (1) and trans&#8208;[PtCl2{iPr2P(C9H8N)}2] (2). The cis&#8208;complex 1 reacted with NEt3 yielding the complex cis&#8208;[PtCl{&#954;2&#8208;(P,N)&#8208;iPr2P(C9H7N)}{iPr2P(C9H8N)}] (3) bearing a cyclometalated &#954;2&#8208;(P,N)&#8208;phosphine ligand, while the isomer 2 with a trans&#8208;configuration did not show any reactivity towards NEt3. Treatment of 1 or 3 with (CH3)4NF (TMAF) resulted in the formation of the twofold cyclometalated complex cis&#8208;[Pt{&#954;2&#8208;(P,N)&#8208;iPr2P(C9H7N)}2] (4). The molecular structures of the complexes 1&#8211;4 were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The fluorido complex cis&#8208;[PtF{&#954;2&#8208;(P,N)&#8208;iPr2P(C9H7N)}{iPr2P(C9H8N)}]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(HF)4 (5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(HF)4) was formed when complex 4 was treated with different hydrogen fluoride sources. The Pt(ii) fluorido complex 5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(HF)4 exhibits intramolecular hydrogen bonding in its outer coordination sphere between the fluorido ligand and the NH group of the 3&#8208;methylindolyl moiety. In contrast to its chlorido analogue 3, complex 5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(HF)4 reacted with CO or the ynamide 1&#8208;(2&#8208;phenylethynyl)&#8208;2&#8208;pyrrolidinone to yield the complexes trans&#8208;[Pt(CO){&#954;2&#8208;(P,C)&#8208;iPr2P(C9H7NCO)}{iPr2P(C9H8N)}][F(HF)4] (7) and a complex, which we suggest to be cis&#8208;[Pt{C=C(Ph)OCN(C3H6)}{&#954;2&#8208;(P,N)&#8208;iPr2P(C9H7N)}{iPr2P(C9H8N)}][F(HF)4] (9), respectively. The structure of 9 was assigned on the basis of DFT calculations as well as NMR and IR data. Hydrogen bonding of HF and NH to fluoride was proven to be crucial for the existence of 7 and 9.

     alt="Platinum Indolylphosphine Fluorido and Polyfluorido Complexes: An Interplay between Cyclometallation, Fluoride Migration, and Hydrogen Bonding"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fluorine on Skatole's scent&lt;/b&gt;. Tetramethylammoniumfluoride permits the twofold cyclometallation of 3-methyl-2-indolylphosphine ligands at platinum(&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;ii&lt;/span&gt;) complexes. Hydrogen fluoride opens the cyclometallation yielding a unique Pt(&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;ii&lt;/span&gt;) complex which exhibits hydrogen-bonding to the fluorido ligand in its outer coordination sphere. The fluorido complex reacts with an ynamide to give an exceptional metal bound oxazole derivative.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

         <title>Target&#8208;Dependent Protection of DNA Aptamers against Nucleolytic Digestion Enables Signal&#8208;On Biosensing with Toehold&#8208;Mediated Rolling Circle Amplification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Digestion protection: a fluorescence assay is demonstrated based on target&#8208;mediated protection of aptamers from 3&#8242;&#8208;exonuclease digestion by phi29 DNA polymerase followed by toehold mediated strand displacement of the target by a circular template to initiate rolling circle amplification, providing sub&#8208;nanomolar detection limits for protein targets, including in serum and plasma.







Abstract
We report a generalizable strategy for biosensing that takes advantage of the resistance of DNA aptamers against nuclease digestion when bound with their targets, coupled with toehold mediated strand displacement (TMSD) and rolling circle amplification (RCA). A DNA aptamer containing a toehold extension at its 5&#8242;&#8208;end protects it from 3&#8242;&#8208;exonuclease digestion by phi29 DNA polymerase (phi29 DP) in a concentration&#8208;dependent manner. The protected aptamer can participate in RCA in the presence of a circular template that is designed to free the aptamer from its target via TMSD. The absence of the target leads to aptamer digestion, and thus no RCA product is produced, resulting in a turn&#8208;on sensor. Using two different DNA aptamers, we demonstrate rapid and quantitative real&#8208;time fluorescence detection of two human proteins: platelet&#8208;derived growth factor (PDGF) and thrombin. Sensitive detection of PDGF was also achieved in human serum and human plasma, demonstrating the selectivity of the assay.

         <title>The Role of Common Alcoholic Sacrificial Agents in Photocatalysis: Is it Always Trivial?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic hydrogen production is proposed as a sustainable energy source. Simultaneous reduction and oxidation of water is a complex multistep reaction with high overpotential. Photocatalytic processes involving semiconductors transfer electrons from the conduction band to the valence band. Sacrificial substrates that react with the photochemically formed holes in the conduction band are often used to study the mechanism of H2  production, as they scavenge the holes and hinder the charge carrier recombination. The desired sacrificial agent is one forming a radical that is a fairly strong reducing agent, and that its oxidized form is not a good electron acceptor that might suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In an acidic medium, methanol was found better to fulfill both these requirements than ethanol and 2&#8208;propanol in the TiO2  &#8208;(M0  &#8208;NPs) (M = Au or Pt) system, while in an alkaline medium, the alcohols exhibit a reverse order of activity. Moreover, we report that CH2(OH)2  is by far the most efficient sacrificial agent in a non&#8208;trivial mechanism in acidic media. Our study provides general guidelines for choosing an appropriate sacrificial substrate and helps to explain the variance in the performance of alcohol scavengers&#8208;based photocatalytic systems.</dc:description>

The existence of pentagonal tunnels, hosting the Li  +  and Na  +  ions, endow LiNaTiTa  2  P  2  O  13  a moderate ion transportation behavior (4.67&#215;10  &#8208;4  S/cm at 823 K).

         <title>Synergistic Effects of Co and Fe on the OER activity of LaCoxFe1&#8722;xO3</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In a combined experimental and theoretical study we assess the role of Co incorporation on the OER activity of LaCo  x  Fe  1&#8722;  x  O  3  . Phase pure perovskites were synthesized up to  x  = 0.300 in 0.025/0.050 steps. HAADF STEM and EDX analysis points towards FeO2  &#8208;terminated (001)&#8208;facets of LaFeO3, in accordance with the stability diagram obtained from density functional theory calculations with a Hubbard  U  term (DFT+  U  ). Linear sweep voltammetry shows a reduction of the OER overpotential and a nonmonotonic trend wtih  x  , with double layer capacitance measurements indicating an intrinsic nature of activity. This is supported by DFT+  U  results that show reduced overpotentials for both Fe and and Co reaction sites with the latter reaching values of 0.32&#8208;0.40 V, ~0.3 V lower than for Fe.&#160;This correlates with a stronger reduction of the binding energy difference of the *O and&#160; *OH intermediates towards an optimum value of 1.6 eV for  x  =0.25, the OH deprotonation being the potential limiting step in most cases. Significant variations of the magnetic moments of both surface and subsurface Co and Fe during the OER demonstrate that the beneficial effect is a result of a concerted action involving many surrounding ions, which extends the concept of the active site.</dc:description>

         <title>Lewis Superacidic Tellurenyl Cation Induced Electrophilic Activation of an Inert Carborane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The aryltellurenyl cation [2&#8208;(tBuNCH)C6H4Te]+, a Lewis super acid, and the weakly coordinating carborane anion [CB11H12]&#8211;, an extremely weak Br&#248;nsted acid (pKa = 131.0 in MeCN), form an isolable ion pair complex [2&#8208;(tBuNCH)C6H4Te][CB11H12], in which the Br&#248;nsted acidity (pKa 7.4 in MeCN) of the formally hydridic B&#8208;H bonds is dramatically increased by more than 120 orders of magnitude. The electrophilic activation of B&#8208;H bonds in the carborane moiety gives rise to a proton transfer from boron to nitrogen at slightly elevated temperatures, as rationalized by the isolation of a mixture of the zwitterionic isomers 12&#8208; and 7&#8208;[2&#8208;(tBuN{H}CH)C6H4Te(CB11H11)] in ratios ranging from 62:38 to 80:20.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Peptide and Gold Catalysis: Enantioselective Addition of Branched Aldehydes to Allenamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of a peptide catalyst and a gold catalyst is presented for enantioselective addition reactions between allenamides and branched aldehydes. The two catalysts act in concert to provide &#947;,&#948;&#8208;enamide aldehydes bearing a fully substituted, benzylic stereogenic center &#8211; a structural motif common in many natural products and therapeutically active compounds &#8211; with good yields and enantioselectivities. The reaction tolerates a variety of alkyl and alkoxy aldehydes and the products can be elaborated into several chiral building blocks bearing either 1,4&#8208; or 1,5&#8208; functional group relationships. Mechanistic studies showed that the conformational features of the peptide are important for both the catalytic efficiency and stereochemistry, while a fine balance of acid/base additives is key for ensuring formation of the desired product over undesired side reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding the Chemical Space of Tetracyanobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene (TCBD) through a Cyano&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction: Synthesis, Structure, and Physicochemical Properties of an Anthryl&#8208;fused&#8722;TCBD Derivative</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetracyanobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene (TCBD) is a powerful and versatile electron&#8208;acceptor moiety widely used for the preparation of electroactive conjugates. While many reports addressing its electron&#8208;accepting capability have appeared in the literature, significantly scarcer are those dealing with its chemical modification, a relevant topic which allows to broaden the chemical space of this interesting functional unit. Here, we report on the first example of a high&#8208;yielding cyano&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder (CDA) reaction between TCBD (i.e., where a nitrile group acts as a dienophile) and an anthryl moiety (i.e., acting as a diene). The resulting anthryl&#8208;fused&#8722;TCBD derivative, which structure was unambiguously identified by X&#8208;ray diffraction, shows high thermal stability, remarkable electron&#8208;accepting capability, and interesting electronic ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state features, as characterized by a thorough theoretical, electrochemical and photophysical investigation. Moreover, a detailed kinetic analysis of the intramolecular CDA reaction transforming the anthryl&#8722;TCBD&#8208;based reactant into the anthryl&#8208;fused&#8722;TCBD product was carried out at different temperatures.</dc:description>

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Molecular Winch Prototypes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis of conceptually new prototypes of molecular winches with the ultimate aim to investigate the work performed by a single ruthenium&#8208;based molecular motor anchored on a surface by probing its ability to pull a load upon electrically&#8208;driven directional rotation. According to a technomimetic design, the motor was embedded in a winch structure, with a long flexible polyethylene glycol chain terminated by an azide hook to connect a variety of molecular loads. The structure of the motor was first derivatized by means of two sequential cross&#8208;coupling reactions involving a penta(4&#8208;halogenophenyl)cyclopentadienyl hydrotris(indazolyl)borate ruthenium(II) precursor and the resulting benzylamine derivative was next exploited as key intermediate in the divergent synthesis of a family of nanowinch prototypes. A one&#8208;pot method involving sequential peptide coupling and Cu&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition was developed to yield four loaded nanowinches, with load fragments encompassing triptycene, fullerene and porphyrin moieties.</dc:description>

         <title>Dinuclear Au(I), Au(II) and Au(III) Complexes with (CF2)n&#160;Chains: Insights into the Role of Aurophilic Interactions in the Au(I) Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New dinuclear Au(I), Au(II) and Au(III) complexes containing (CF  2  )  n  bridging chains were obtained. Metallomacrocycles [Au  2  {&#956;&#8208;(CF  2  )  4  }{&#956;&#8208;diphosphine}] show an uncommon figure&#8208;eight structure, whose helicity inversion barrier is influenced by aurophilic interactions and steric constraints imposed by the diphosphine. Halogenation of LAu(CF  2  )  4  AuL (L = PPh  3  , PMe  3  , (dppf)  1/2  , (binap)  1/2  ) gave [Au(II)]  2  species, some of which display unprecedented folded structures with Au&#8211;Au bonds. Aurophilic interactions facilitate this oxidation process by preorganizing the starting [Au(I)]  2  complexes and lowering its redox potential. The obtained [Au(II)]  2  complexes undergo thermal or photochemical elimination of R  3  PAuX to give Au(III) perfluorinated auracycles. Evidence of a radical mechanism for these decomposition reactions was obtained.</dc:description>

The method used Zeng&#8217;s Rh(CAAC) carbene catalyst  4  in the hydrogenation following the protocol developed by Glorius. The resultant Janus pentafluorocyclohexylacetate methyl ester  16  was converted to the corresponding alcohol  18  , aldehyde  13  , bromide  29  and azide  14  through functional group manipulations, and some of these building blocks were used in Ugi&#8208;multicomponent and Cu&#8208;catalysed click reactions.

         <title>The Influence of Secondary Interactions on the [N&#8722;I&#8722;N]+ Halogen Bond</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halogen bond&#8208;stabilized halonium ions are mild halenium transfer agents. The dependence of their reactivity on chelation, strain, steric hindrance and electrostatic interaction has been evaluated using NMR, DFT and kinetics experiments. The mechanistic analysis of the transfer is expected to provide a handle in the induction of stereoselectivity in electrophilic halogenations.







Abstract
[Bis(pyridine)iodine(I)]+ complexes offer controlled access to halonium ions under mild conditions. The reactivity of such stabilized halonium ions is primarily determined by their three&#8208;center, four&#8208;electron [N&#8722;I&#8722;N]+ halogen bond. We studied the importance of chelation, strain, steric hindrance and electrostatic interaction for the structure and reactivity of halogen bonded halonium ions by acquiring their 15N NMR coordination shifts and measuring their iodenium release rates, and interpreted the data with the support of DFT computations. A bidentate ligand stabilizes the [N&#8722;I&#8722;N]+ halogen bond, decreasing the halenium transfer rate. Strain weakens the bond and accordingly increases the release rate. Remote modifications in the backbone do not influence the stability as long as the effect is entirely steric. Incorporating an electron&#8208;rich moiety close by the [N&#8722;I&#8722;N]+ motif increases the iodenium release rate. The analysis of the iodine(I) transfer mechanism highlights the impact of secondary interactions, and may provide a handle on the induction of stereoselectivity in electrophilic halogenations.

         <title>A Water Soluble Pd2L4 Cage for Selective Binding of Neu5Ac</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carbohydrate binding pocket of an organic soluble [Pd2L4]4+ cage could be equipped with guanidinium&#8208;terminating dendrons to give the water soluble [Pd2L4][NO3]16 cage. It was shown by means of NMR spectroscopy that the cage binds selectively to anionic monosaccharides and strongest to Neu5Ac with Ka=24&#8197;M&#8722;1.

The sialic acid N&#8208;acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and its derivatives are involved in many biological processes including cell&#8208;cell recognition and infection by influenza. Molecules that can recognize Neu5Ac might thus be exploited to intervene in or monitor such events. A key obstacle in this development is the sparse availability of easily prepared molecules that bind to this carbohydrate in its natural solvent; water. Here, we report that the carbohydrate binding pocket of an organic soluble [Pd2L4]4+ cage could be equipped with guanidinium&#8208;terminating dendrons to give the water soluble [Pd2L4][NO3]16 cage 7. It was shown by means of NMR spectroscopy that 7 binds selectively to anionic monosaccharides and strongest to Neu5Ac with Ka=24&#8197;M&#8722;1. The cage had low to no affinity for the thirteen neutral saccharides studied. Aided by molecular modeling, the selectivity for anionic carbohydrates such as Neu5Ac could be rationalized by the presence of charge assisted hydrogen bonds and/or the presence of a salt bridge with a guanidinium solubilizing arm of 7. Establishing that a simple coordination cage such as 7 can already selectively bind to Neu5Ac in water paves the way to improve the stability, affinity and/or selectivity properties of M2L4 cages for carbohydrates and other small molecules.

         <dc:description>
&#8220;Double switch&#8221;: Novel redox&#8208;active and proton&#8208;sensitive phosphine ligands in conjunction with their metal complexes are reported. The donating capabilities can be switched orthogonally and reversibly by either protonation or oxidation. Application in Rh&#8208;catalysed hydrosilylation showed that they influence either the rate of conversion and/or the product distribution.







Abstract
Novel multistimuli&#8208;responsive phosphine ligands comprising a redox&#8208;active [3]dioxaphosphaferrocenophane backbone and a P&#8208;bound imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenamino entity that allows switching by protonation are reported. Investigation of the corresponding metal complexes and their redox behaviour are reported and show the sensitivity of the system towards protonation and metal coordination. The experimental findings are supported by DFT calculations. Protonation and oxidation events are applied in Rh&#8208;catalysed hydrosilylations and demonstrate a remarkable influence on reactivity and/or selectivity.

         <title>Effectiveness of the Oxygenation over Classical Protonolysis Reactions: A Case of Alkylzinc Complexes Incorporating an Aminoalcoholate Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stepwise controlled oxygenation of a tert&#8208;butylzinc complex incorporating a pridinolum (prinol) ligand affords a dinuclear adduct of a (prinol)ZnOOR moiety with the parent tBuZn(prinol) complex and a novel dimer [tBuOOZn(prinol)]2 with terminal alkylperoxide groups. Strikingly, these seemingly simple zinc alkylperoxides and related zinc alkoxides are not accessible via the classical protonolysis route.







Abstract
Alkylzinc aminoalcoholates have emerged as powerful catalysts in organic synthesis and polymerization processes. Despite extensive research, difficulties in the rational design of these catalytic systems and in&#8208;depth understanding of their modes of action have hitherto been encountered. Most of the major obstacles stem largely from the relatively limited knowledge of the structure&#8208;activity relationship of zinc catalysts. In fact, the key active species are often generated in&#8197;situ via the protonolysis of the alkylzinc precursors, which precludes their isolation and detailed characterization. Herein, the effectiveness of the oxygenation over the classical protonolysis in the synthesis of zinc alkylperoxides stabilized by an aminoalcoholate ligand is demonstrated. The controlled oxygenation of a tert&#8208;butylzinc complex incorporating a pridinolum (prinol) ligand leads to well&#8208;defined a dinuclear adduct of a (prinol)ZnOOtBu moiety with the parent tBuZn(prinol) complex and a novel dimer [tBuOOZn(prinol)]2 with terminal alkylperoxide groups. The observed reaction outcomes strongly depend on the reaction conditions. Although sparse examples of heteroleptic adducts of the [RZn(L)]x[ROOZn(L)]y&#8208;type are known, the herein reported homoleptic [ROOZn(L)]x aggregate is unprecedented. Strikingly, comparative studies involving reactions between tBuZn(prinol) and tert&#8208;butylhydroperoxide or ethanol revealed that the respective seemingly simple zinc alkylperoxides, or zinc alkoxides, respectively, are not accessible via the classical alcoholysis. We believe that these game&#8208;changing results concerning multifaceted chemistry of organozinc aminoalcoholates should pave the way for more rational development of various Zn&#8208;based catalytic systems.

         <title>Halogen&#8208;Bonding Strapped Porphyrin BODIPY Rotaxanes for Dual Optical and Electrochemical Anion Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of porphyrin&#8208;BODIPY halogen bonding [2]rotaxanes have been prepared according to an active metal template strategy. Capitalising on the augmented anion affinities by virtue of axle triazole ligation to macrocyclic zinc(II) metalloporphyrin, the incorporation of fluorogenic BODIPY and redox&#8208;active porphyrin transducing groups allows dual&#8208;channel sensing of anions by quenching BODIPY emission and through cathodic perturbations of porphyrin oxidation redox couples.







Abstract
Anion receptors employing two distinct sensory mechanisms are rare. Herein, we report the first examples of halogen&#8208;bonding porphyrin BODIPY [2]rotaxanes capable of both fluorescent and redox electrochemical sensing of anions. 1H NMR, UV/visible and electrochemical studies revealed rotaxane axle triazole group coordination to the zinc(II) metalloporphyrin&#8208;containing macrocycle component, serves to preorganise the rotaxane binding cavity and dramatically enhances anion binding affinities. Mechanically bonded, integrated&#8208;axle BODIPY and macrocycle strapped metalloporphyrin motifs enable the anion recognition event to be sensed by the significant quenching of the BODIPY fluorophore and cathodic perturbations of the metalloporphyrin P/P+. redox couple.

Making a transfer: An iron&#8208;catalyzed, aerobic, biomimetic oxidation of various N&#8208;heterocycles by using the bifunctional hybrid catalyst Co(Salophen)&#8208;HQ as an electron&#8208;transfer mediator (ETM) is reported. The reaction provides various important aromatic heterocycles in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields. The dehydrogenation involves several electron&#8208;transfer steps that are inspired by biological oxidation processes in which molecular oxygen (O2) is used as terminal oxidant.







Abstract
Herein, an iron(II)&#8208;catalyzed biomimetic oxidation of N&#8208;heterocycles under aerobic conditions is described. The dehydrogenation process, involving several electron&#8208;transfer steps, is inspired by oxidations occurring in the respiratory chain. An environmentally friendly and inexpensive iron catalyst together with a hydroquinone/cobalt Schiff base hybrid catalyst as electron&#8208;transfer mediator were used for the substrate&#8208;selective dehydrogenation reaction of various N&#8208;heterocycles. The method shows a broad substrate scope and delivers important heterocycles in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields.

         <title>Impact of surface defects on LaNiO3 perovskite electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perovskite oxides are regarded as promising electrocatalysts for water splitting due to their cost&#8208;effectiveness, high efficiency and durability in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Despite these advantages, a fundamental understanding of how critical structural parameters of perovskite electrocatalysts influences their activity and stability is lacking. Here, we investigate the impact of structural defects on OER performance for representative LaNiO  3  perovskite electrocatalysts. Hydrogen reduction of 700 &#176;C calcined LaNiO  3  induces a high density of surface oxygen vacancies, and confers significantly enhanced OER activity and stability compared to unreduced LaNiO  3  ; the former exhibit a low onset overpotential of  380 mV at 10 mA.cm  &#8208;2  and a small Tafel slope of 70.8 mV.dec  &#8208;1  . Oxygen vacancy formation is accompanied by mixed Ni  2+  /Ni  3+  valence states, which quantum&#8208;chemical DFT calculations reveal modify the perovskite electronic structure. Surface oxygen vacancy formation is relatively facile, and favoured over lattice vacancy formation, and increases the electronic conductivity of reduced LaNiO  3  , in accordance with the enhanced OER activity observed.</dc:description>

         <title>Water&#8208;Assisted Chemical Route Towards the Oxygen Evolution Reaction at the Hydrated (110) Ruthenium Oxide Surface: heterogeneous catalysis via DFT&#8208;MD&#160;&amp;&#160;metadynamics simulations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Notwithstanding RuO 2&#160; is one of the most active catalysts toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a plethora of fundamental details on its catalytic properties are still elusive, severely limiting its large&#8208;scale deployment. Herein, spin&#8208;polarized Density Functional Theory Molecular Dynamics (DFT&#8208;MD) simulations, coupled with advanced enhanced sampling methods in the well&#8208;tempered metadynamics framework, are applied to gain a global understanding of RuO 2&#160; aqueous interface (explicit water solvent) in catalyzing the OER, and hence possibly help in the design of novel catalysts in the context of photochemical water oxidation. The present study quantitatively assesses the free&#8208;energy barriers behind the OER at the (110)&#8208;RuO 2&#160; catalyst surface revealing plausible pathways composing the reaction network of the O 2&#160; evolution. In particular, OER is investigated at room temperature when such a surface is exposed to both gas&#8208;phase and liquid&#8208;phase water. Albeit a unique efficient pathway has been identified in the gas&#8208;phase OER, a surprisingly lowest&#8208;free&#8208;energy&#8208;requiring reaction route is possible when (110)&#8208;RuO 2&#160; is in contact with explicit liquid water. By estimating the free&#8208;energy surfaces associated to these processes, we reveal a&#160;water&#8208;assisted OER mechanism which involves a crucial proton&#8208;transfer&#8208;step assisted by the local water environment. These findings pave the way toward the systematic usage of those techniques for the fine assessment of the activity of catalysts, considering finite&#8208;temperature and explicit&#8208;solvent effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Pathway&#8208;Dependent Phase Transitions of Supramolecular Self&#8208;assemblies Containing Cationic Amphiphiles with Azobenzene and Disulfide Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The original molecular crystals containing cationic amphiphiles with azobenzene and disulfide groups showed different phase transitions depending on the application order of a reduction agent and light irradiation. The current molecular system can provide a methodology for developing new stimuli&#8208;responsive materials that exhibit the desirable properties under specific circumstances from a systems chemistry viewpoint.







Abstract
There have been several attempts to construct supramolecular chemical systems that mimic the phase transitions in living systems. However, most of these phase transitions are one&#8208;to&#8208;one and induced by one stimulus or chemical; there have been few reports on the pathway&#8208;dependent phase transition of supramolecular self&#8208;assemblies in multi&#8208;step. To induce multistep phase transitions, molecular crystals were prepared that contained a cationic amphiphile bearing azobenzene and disulfide groups. A reducing agent caused the crystals to become vesicles, and adjacent, non&#8208;touching vesicles fused under UV and subsequent visible light. Adding a reducing agent to the worm&#8208;like aggregates that were generated after UV irradiation of the original crystals resulted in the growth of sheet&#8208;like aggregates. 1H NMR and fluorescence anisotropy measurements showed that a series of phase transitions was induced by changes in the phase structures from molecular conversions of the reactive amphiphiles. The multiple pathway&#8208;dependent phase transitions of supramolecular self&#8208;assemblies can provide a methodology for developing new stimuli&#8208;responsive materials that exhibit the desirable properties under specific circumstances from a systems chemistry viewpoint.

         <title>Ternary Hybrid Perovskite Solid Solution Single Crystals: Growth, Composition Determination and Phase Stability in Highly Moist Atmosphere</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;centimeter&#8208;sized ternary hybrid perovskite solid solution single crystals have been grown. Wavelength disperse X&#8208;ray fluorescence is used as a quantitative elemental analysis method. The crystals with optimized composition show superior phase stability when they are stored in high&#8208;humidity environment for over two weeks, while those Cs&#8208;richer or Cs&#8208;poorer samples undergo various degrees of phase segregation induced by moisture.







Abstract
Ternary hybrid perovskite solid solutions have shown superior optoelectronic properties and better stability than their ABX3 simple perovskite counterparts under ambient conditions. However, crystal growth and identification of the accurate composition of these complex crystalline compounds remain challenging, and their stability under extreme conditions such as in highly moist atmosphere is unknown. Herein, large&#8208;size (up to 2&#8197;cm) single crystals of ternary perovskite 0.80FAPbI3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;x&#8242;FAPbBr3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;y&#8242;CsPbI3 (x&#8242;+y&#8242;=0.20) are grown. An elemental analysis method based on wavelength dispersive X&#8208;ray fluorescence is proposed to determine their accurate compositions. Among these single crystals, the composition with y&#8242;=0.12 shows the best moisture stability at 90&#8201;% relative humidity for 15&#8197;days. Other components with richer or poorer Cs+ ions undergo different phase segregation behaviours. The performance and stability of photodetectors based on these single crystals are tested. This work offers a deeper insight into phase stability of ternary hybrid perovskite solid solution crystals in highly moist atmosphere.

         <title>Oxidatively Induced Selective Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bond Formation From Isolated Rhodium(III) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the oxidation&#8208;induced reaction based on octahedral RhIII complexes synthesized from Rh2(TFA)4 with 2&#8208;arylpyridines, different regioselective C&#8722;C bond formations were achieved by changing the steric and electronic properties of the aryl ligands. This study provides feasible selective activation of C&#8722;H bonds by the oxidation induction of RhIII complexes, which may be useful for the design of new rhodium metal catalysts and development of efficient and highly selective reactions.







Abstract
This work focuses on oxidatively induced regioselective intramolecular C&#8722;C bond formations based on the RhIII complexes synthesized from dirhodium(II) trifluoroacetate with 2&#8208;arylpyridines. With the selection of electron&#8208;donating groups on the arene rings of 2&#8208;arylpyridines, the unusual meta&#8208;ortho C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming was favored, which led to the formation of meta&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;arylpyridine homocoupling dimers. On the contrary, the electron&#8208;withdrawing groups have tendency to occur conventional ortho&#8208;ortho bond&#8208;forming, resulting in the formation of new RhIII complexes possessing the intriguing RhIII(TFA)3 fragment. Preliminary mechanistic experiments suggest that the sequential oxidation of RhIII occurred in the reaction.

Preliminary mechanistic experiments suggest that the sequential oxidation of Rh&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; occurred in the reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Potassium Ion Conductivity in the Cubic Labyrinth of a Piezoelectric, Antiferromagnetic Oxoferrate(III) Tellurate(VI)</title>

K(nockout) response: K12+6xFe6Te4&#8722;xO27 was synthesized under hydroflux conditions. The acentric cubic crystal structure comprises two non&#8208;interpenetrating chiral oxometalate networks formed by edge&#8208; or corner&#8208;sharing [TeVIO6] and [FeIIIO5] polyhedra. The potassium ions are mobile in the labyrinth between the networks. The magnetic moments of the iron cations are pairwise antiparallel, and the compound exhibits a strong piezoelectric response.







Abstract
Orange&#8208;colored crystals of the oxoferrate tellurate K12+6xFe6Te4&#8722;xO27 [x=0.222(4)] were synthesized in a potassium hydroxide hydroflux with a molar water&#8211;base ratio n(H2O)/n(KOH) of 1.5 starting from Fe(NO3)3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;9H2O, TeO2 and H2O2 at about 200&#8201;&#176;C. By using (NH4)2TeO4 instead of TeO2, a fine powder consisting of microcrystalline spheres of K12+6xFe6Te4&#8722;xO27 was obtained. K12+6xFe6Te4&#8722;xO27 crystallizes in the acentric cubic space group I
3d. [FeIIIO5] pyramids share their apical atoms in [Fe2O9] groups and two of their edges with [TeVIO6] octahedra to form an open framework that consists of two loosely connected, but not interpenetrating, chiral networks. The flexibility of the hinged oxometalate network manifests in a piezoelectric response similar to that of LiNbO3.The potassium cations are mobile in channels that run along the &lt;111&gt; directions and cross in cavities acting as nodes. The ion conductivity of cold&#8208;pressed pellets of ball&#8208;milled K12+6xFe6Te4&#8722;xO27 is 2.3&#215;10&#8722;4 S&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature. Magnetization measurements and neutron diffraction indicate antiferromagnetic coupling in the [Fe2O9] groups.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of methodologies to control on demand and reversibly supramolecular transformations from self&#8208;assembled metalla&#8208;structures requires the rational design of architectures able to answer to an applied stimulus. While solvent, concentration, guest, light, addition of a chemical have been largely explored to provide these transformations, the case of pH sensitive materials is less described. Herein, we report the first example of a pH&#8208;triggered dissociation of a coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembled interlocked molecular link. It incorporates a pH sensitive benzobisimidazole&#8208;based ligand that can be selectively protonated on its bisimidazole moieties. This generates intermolecular electrostatic repulsions that reduces drastically the stability of the interlocked structure, leading to its dissociation without any sign of protonation of the basic pyridine moieties involved in the coordination bonds. Importantly, the dissociation process is reversible through addition of a base.</dc:description>

         <title>A Structural Diversity of Molecular Alkaline&#8208;Earth&#8208;Metal Polyphosphides: From Supramolecular Wheel to Zintl Ion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mis&#8208;matched: Air stable pentaphosphaferrocene or white phosphorus are used as polyphosphorus source to access molecular group 2 polyphosphides. Structurally diverse polyphosphides ranging supramolecular wheel to Zintl ions have been accessed by using various group 2 reagents such as organo&#8208;magnesium, mono&#8208;valent magnesium or molecular calcium hydride complex. The ancillary ligands and the metal ions influences the structural motifs of the polyphosphides, which was investigated theoretically as well.







Abstract
A series of molecular group 2 polyphosphides has been synthesized by using air&#8208;stable [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] (Cp*=C5Me5) or white phosphorus as polyphosphorus precursors. Different types of group 2 reagents such as organo&#8208;magnesium, mono&#8208;valent magnesium, and molecular calcium hydride complexes have been investigated to activate these polyphosphorus sources. The organo&#8208;magnesium complex [(DippBDI&#8722;Mg(CH3))2] (DippBDI={[2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3NCMe]2CH}&#8722;) reacts with [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] to give an unprecedented Mg/Fe&#8208;supramolecular wheel. Kinetically controlled activation of [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] by different mono&#8208;valent magnesium complexes allowed the isolation of Mg&#8208;coordinated formally mono&#8208; and di&#8208;reduced products of [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)]. To obtain the first examples of molecular calcium&#8208;polyphosphides, a molecular calcium hydride complex was used to reduce the aromatic cyclo&#8208;P5 ring of [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)]. The Ca&#8208;Fe&#8208;polyphosphide is also characterized by quantum chemical calculations and compared with the corresponding Mg complex. Moreover, a calcium coordinated Zintl ion (P7)3&#8722; was obtained by molecular calcium hydride mediated P4 reduction.

         <dc:description>
Through a new method of low&#8208;temperature (only 350&#8201;&#176;C) self&#8208;reduction, a highly efficient deep blue&#8208;emitting phosphor Ca[B8O11(OH)4]&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+ was prepared, with a high PLQY of 95&#8201;% and a color purity of 97.6&#8201;%. Then, a WLED fabricated by the as&#8208;prepared CBH&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;%Eu2+ presents outstanding performance with a luminous efficacy (LE) of 13.9&#8197;lm/W, a color rendering index (CRI) of 89.4, and a correlated color temperature (CCT) of 5825&#8197;K.







Abstract
Highly efficient inorganic phosphors are crucial for solid&#8208;state lighting. In this paper, a new method of low&#8208;temperature self&#8208;reduction was used for preparing a highly efficient deep blue&#8208;emitting phosphor of Ca[B8O11(OH)4]&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+ (CBH&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+). The crystal structure, morphology, chemical state, and photoluminescence (PL) properties of the CBH&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+ phosphor have been investigated. By using the screened hybrid function (HSE06), the band gap (Eg) of CBH was calculated to be 7.48&#8197;eV, which is a necessary condition for achieving high quantum yield phosphors. The experiment results show that almost all the added raw materials of Eu3+ can be reduced to Eu2+ in CBH crystal under a non&#8208;reducing atmosphere. The CBH&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+ phosphor shows a broad excitation spectrum centered at 277 and 327&#8197;nm in the range of 220 to 400&#8197;nm, and a narrow&#8208;band emission spectrum centered at 428&#8197;nm in the range of 400 to 500&#8197;nm, with a full width at half maximum (fwhm) of 42.35&#8197;nm. Under UV radiation, the CBH&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;%Eu2+ exhibits high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY=95.0&#8201;%), high external quantum efficiency (EQE=31.1&#8201;%), and ultra&#8208;high color purity (97.6&#8201;%). The PL intensity of CBH&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;%Eu2+ remains 62.6&#8201;% of the initial intensity at 150&#8201;&#176;C. Finally, the white light&#8208;emitting diodes (WLED) fabricated by CBH&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;%Eu2+, excited by a 365&#8197;nm chip, presents outstanding performances with a luminous efficacy (LE) of 13.9 lm/W, a color rendering index (CRI) of 89.4, and a correlated color temperature (CCT) of 5825&#8197;K. The above results show that CBH&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+ can be used as a promising blue phosphor for WLED. This new method of low&#8208;temperature self&#8208;reduction can be applied to design and prepare other new types of highly efficient phosphors.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highly efficient inorganic phosphors are crucial for solid-state lighting. In this paper, a new method of low-temperature self-reduction was used for preparing a highly efficient deep blue-emitting phosphor of Ca[B&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8201;:&#8201;Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (CBH&#8201;:&#8201;Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;).

         <title>Unveiling the Role of Hydrogen Bonds in Luminescent N&#8208;Annulated Perylene Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Getting into position: The position of hydrogen&#8208;bonding amide groups affects the properties of a series of luminescent N&#8208;annulated perylenes that self&#8208;assemble into nanostructured liquid&#8208;crystalline columnar phases. The liquid crystals with the amide linkers close to the central perylene core exhibit liquid&#8208;crystalline phases with a wider temperature range. In contrast, perylenes with ester groups, instead of amides, close to the central core exhibit vapochromism upon exposure to organic solvents.







Abstract
We report the liquid&#8208;crystalline (LC) and luminescent properties of a series of N&#8208;annulated perylenes (1&#8211;4) in whose molecular structures amide and ester groups alternate. We found that the LC properties of these compounds not only depend on the number of hydrogen&#8208;bonding units, but also on the relative position of the amide linkers in the molecule. The absence of amide groups in compound 1 leads to no LC properties, whereas four amide groups induce the formation of a wide temperature range columnar hexagonal phase in compound 4. Remarkably, compound 3, with two amide groups in the inner part of the structure, stabilizes the columnar LC phases better than its structural isomer 2, with the amide groups in the outer part of the molecule. Similarly, we found that only compounds 1 and 2, which have no hydrogen bonding units in the inner part of the molecule, exhibit luminescence vapochromism upon exposure to organic solvent vapors.

         <title>Influence of N&#8208;Substituents on Photovoltaic Properties of Singly Bay&#8208;Linked Dimeric Perylene Diimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By developing a general synthetic strategy, we synthesized a new series of bay&#8208;linked dimeric perylene diimides (diPDIs), some of which possess primary N&#8208;alkyl substituents or unsymmetric N&#8208;substitution pattern. The systematic investigation on their photovoltaic properties revealed that the primary alkyl substituents are advantageous for enhancing the device performance in terms of crystallinity improvement and film&#8208;forming controllability.







Abstract
The influence of N&#8208;substituents on the photovoltaic properties of singly bay&#8208;linked perylene diimides (diPDIs) was systematically investigated to understand the aromatic&#8208;aliphatic balance, which is beneficial for achieving high device performance in organic photovoltaic (OPV) systems. The synthesis of various N&#8208;substituted diPDIs was successfully achieved using a newly developed one&#8208;step procedure, resulting in sufficiently high yields. Detailed investigations of seven variants of diPDIs demonstrated that the primary alkyl substituents, particularly the 2&#8208;ethylhexyl group, induce the self&#8208;organized growth of thin films with high crystallinity. This is beneficial for enhancing the device performance of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) systems. The results presented herein reveal the important roles of alkyl side chains as hydrophobic solubilizing auxiliaries or primary determinants in the control of the active layer nanomorphology. This offers a valuable guideline that is essential for developing high&#8208;performance organic semiconductor materials for future practical applications.

         <title>Galactose Grafted Two&#8208;Dimensional Nanosheets as a Scaffold for the In Situ Synthesis of Silver Nanoparticles: A Potential Catalyst for the Reduction of Nitroaromatics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amphiphilicity&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of galactose&#8208;hexaphenylbenzene based amphiphiles into galactose&#8208;decorated 2D nanosheet is reported. The extremely dense decoration of reducing sugar on the surface of the sheets is used for the in&#8197;situ synthesis and immobilization of ultrafine catalytically active AgNPs by using Tollens&#8217; reaction. The potential of the system as a recyclable catalyst for the reduction of various nitroaromatics is demonstrated. Enhanced catalytic activity is observed for the immobilized AgNPs when compared to the corresponding discrete AgNPs.







Abstract
Two major hurdles in NP&#8208;based catalysis are the aggregation of the NPs and their recycling. Immobilization of NPs onto a 2D support is the most promising strategy to overcome these difficulties. Herein, amphiphilicity&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of galactose&#8208;hexaphenylbenzene&#8208;based amphiphiles into galactose&#8208;decorated 2D nanosheet is reported. The extremely dense decoration of reducing sugar on the surface of the sheets is used for the in&#8197;situ synthesis and immobilization of ultrafine catalytically active AgNPs by using Tollens&#8217; reaction. The potential of the system as a catalyst for the reduction of various nitroaromatics is demonstrated. Enhanced catalytic activity is observed for the immobilized AgNPs when compared to the corresponding discrete AgNPs. Recovery of the catalytic system from the reaction mixture by ultrafiltration and its subsequent recycling for several cycles without dropping its activity is shown. This is the first report demonstrating the in&#8197;situ synthesis and immobilization of ultrafine AgNPs onto a 2D nanosheet that exhibits excellent catalytic performance for the reduction of nitroaromatics.

Silver(I) and copper(I) arene complexes [(WCA&#8208;NHC)M(&#951;2&#8208;toluene)] (M=Ag, Cu) with a weakly coordinating anionic (WCA) borate moiety were prepared and their ability to serve as transmetalation reagents was investigated. However, the high stability of WCA&#8208;NHC&#8208;metal bonds provided access to heterobimetallic complexes such as [(WCA&#8208;NHC)M(&#956;&#8208;Cl)2Ru(PPh3)(&#951;6&#8208;p&#8208;cymene)], which resisted the elimination of AgCl or CuCl, respectively.







Abstract
The lithium complexes [(WCA&#8208;NHC)Li(toluene)] of anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes with a weakly coordinating borate moiety (WCA&#8208;NHC, WCA=B(C6F5)3, NHC=IDipp=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) were used for the preparation of silver(I) or copper(I) WCA&#8208;NHC complexes. While the reactions in THF with AgCl or CuCl afforded anionic mono&#8208; and dicarbene complexes with solvated lithium counterions [Li(THF)n]+ (n=3, 4), the reactions in toluene proceeded with elimination of LiCl and formation of the neutral phosphine and arene complexes [(WCA&#8208;NHC)M(PPh3)] and [(WCA&#8208;NHC)M(&#951;2&#8208;toluene)] (M=Ag, Cu). The latter were used for the preparation of chlorido&#8208; and iodido&#8208;bridged heterobimetallic Ag/Ru and Cu/Ru complexes [(WCA&#8208;NHC)M(&#956;&#8208;X)2Ru(PPh3)(&#951;6&#8208;p&#8208;cymene)] (M=Ag, Cu, X=Cl; M=Ag, X=I). Surprisingly, these complexes resisted the elimination of CuCl, AgCl, or AgI, precluding WCA&#8208;NHC transmetalation.

         <title>SnS nanosheets for rapid and effective bacteria sterilization under near&#8208;infrared irradiation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Today, the threat of pathogenic bacterial infection worldwide that leads to the increase of mortality rate strongly demands the development of new antibacterial agents that can kill bacteria quickly and effectively. Although there are a lot of antibacterial agents that have been developed so far, few studies on the antibacterial ability of SnS have been investigated at 808 nm laser.   Here, we synthesized SnS nanosheets with strong near&#8208;infrared absorption performance and excellent antibacterial performance via a simple hydrothermal synthesis route.  The as&#8208;prepared SnS nanosheets showed excellent photothermal conversion efficiency (38.7%), photodynamic performance, and photostability, and at the same time 99.98% and 99.7% sterilization effect against Gram&#8208;negative  Escherichia coli  (  E. coli  ) and Gram&#8208;positive  Bacillus subtilis  (  B. subtilis  ) under near&#8208;infrared irradiation (808 nm, 1.5 W / cm  2  ). This study suggests that SnS nanosheets could be a promising candidate for antibacterial therapy owing to the synergetic effects of photothermal and photodynamic performance..</dc:description>

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Polymer Particles Prepared by Classical Polymerization Techniques</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Getting things in order: Liquid crystal (LC) polymer particles have a unique anisotropic supramolecular order that distinguishes them from conventional polymer particles. This review focuses on the preparation of LC polymer particles by classical polymerization techniques, including suspension, mini&#8208;emulsion, dispersion and precipitation polymerization. The particle size, LC phases, alignment, properties and applications are also presented.







Abstract
Liquid&#8208;crystalline polymer particles prepared by classical polymerization techniques are receiving increased attention as promising candidates for use in a variety of applications including micro&#8208;actuators, structurally colored objects, and absorbents. These particles have anisotropic molecular order and liquid&#8208;crystalline phases that distinguish them from conventional polymer particles. In this minireview, the preparation of liquid&#8208;crystalline polymer particles from classical suspension, (mini&#8208;)emulsion, dispersion, and precipitation polymerization reactions are discussed. The particle sizes, molecular orientations, and liquid&#8208;crystalline phases produced by each technique are summarized and compared. We conclude with a discussion of the challenges and prospects of the preparation of liquid&#8208;crystalline polymer particles by classical polymerization techniques.

         <title>How Aromatic Fluorination Exchanges the Interaction Role of Pyridine with Carbonyl Compounds: The Formaldehyde Adduct</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The full ring fluorination of pyridine has a dramatic effect on its binding properties by creating a &#960;&#8208;hole. In the adduct pentafluoropyridine&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;formaldehyde the presence of fluorine atoms exchanges the electron donor&#8208;acceptor roles of both molecules when compared to those observed in the pyridine&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;formaldehyde adduct.







Abstract
The rotational spectrum of the weakly bound complex pentafluoropyridine&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;formaldehyde has been investigated using Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy. From the analysis of the rotational parameters of the parent species and of the 13C and 15N isotopologues, the structural arrangement of the adduct has been unambiguously established. The full ring fluorination of pyridine has a dramatic effect on its binding properties: It alters the electron density distribution at the &#960;&#8208;cloud of pyridine creating a &#960;&#8208;hole and changing its electron donor&#8208;acceptor capabilities. In the complex, formaldehyde lies above the aromatic ring with one of the oxygen lone pairs, as conventionally envisaged, pointing toward its centre. This lone pair&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;&#8208;hole interaction, reinforced by a weak C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interaction, indicates an exchange of the electron&#8208;acceptor roles of both molecules when compared to the pyridine&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;formaldehyde adduct. Tunnelling doublets due to the internal rotation of formaldehyde have also been observed and analysed leading to a discussion on the competition between lone pair&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;&#8208;hole and &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking interactions.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks&#8208;Derived Self&#8208;Supported Carbon&#8208;Based Composites for Electrocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic water splitting has been considered as a promising strategy for the sustainable evolution of hydrogen energy and storage of intermittent electric energy. Efficient catalysts for electrocatalytic water splitting are urgently demanded to decrease the overpotentials and promote the sluggish reaction kinetics. Carbon&#8208;based composites, including heteroatom&#8208;doped carbon materials, metals/alloys@carbon composites, metal compounds@carbon composites, and atomically dispersed metal sites@carbon composites have been widely used as the catalysts due to their fascinating properties. However, these electrocatalysts are almost powdery form, and should be cast on the current collector by using the polymeric binder, which would result in the unsatisfied electrocatalytic performance. In comparison, a self&#8208;supported electrode architecture is highly attractive. Recently, self&#8208;supported metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) constructed by coordination of metal centers and organic ligands have been considered as suitable templates/precursors to construct free&#8208;standing carbon&#8208;based composites grown on conductive substrate. MOFs&#8208;derived carbon&#8208;based composites have various merits, such as the well&#8208;aligned array architecture and evenly distributed active sites, and easy functionalization with other species, which make them suitable alternatives to non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;included electrocatalysts. In this review, we intend to show the research progresses by employment of MOFs as precursors to prepare self&#8208;supported carbon&#8208;based composites. Focusing on these MOFs&#8208;derived carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials, the latest advances in their controllable synthesis, composition regulation, electrocatalytic performances in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and overall water splitting (OWS) are presented. Finally, the challenges and perspectives are showed for the further developments of MOFs&#8208;derived self&#8208;supported carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials in electrocatalytic reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyrene modified serinol nucleic acid nanostructure converts chirality of threoninol nucleic acids into circularly polarized luminescence signals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein report a circularly polarized luminescent (CPL) probe that can respond to chirality of nucleic acids. An achiral nanostructure was prepared by hybridization of symmetric serinol nucleic acid (SNA) containing pyrene&#8208;modified residues. When chiral oligomers were added that were complementary to the SNA, they induced helicity into the SNA nanowire. Efficient circular dichroism (CD) signal amplification was observed when pyrene was attached to uracil base through a rigid alkynyl linker.&#160; Both CPL signals and CD signals were observed that depended on the chirality of added acyclic threoninol nucleic acid (  a  TNA) oligomer. This system can be used to convert chirality of chiral biomolecules into chiroptical signals.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic Structure and Superconductivity of Compressed Metal Tetrahydrides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetrahydrides crystallizing in the ThCr  2  Si  2  structure type have been predicted to become stable for a plethora of metals under pressure, and some have recently been synthesized. Through detailed first&#8208;principles investigations we show that the metal atoms within these  I  4  /mmm  symmetry MH  4  compounds may be divalent, trivalent or tetravalent. The valence of the metal atom and its radius govern the bonding and electronic structure of these phases, and their evolution under pressure. The factors important for enhancing superconductivity include a large number of hydrogenic states at the Fermi level, and the presence of quasi&#8208;molecular H units whose bonds have been stretched and weakened (but not broken) via electron transfer from the electropositive metal, and via a Kubas&#8208;like interaction with the metal. Analysis of the microscopic mechanism of superconductivity in MgH  4  , ScH  4  and ZrH  4  reveals that phonon modes involving a coupled libration and stretch of the H units leading to the formation of more complex hydrogenic motifs are important contributors towards the electron phonon coupling mechanism. In the divalent hydride MgH  4  , modes associated with motions of the hydridic hydrogen atoms were also key contributors, and softened substantially at lower pressures.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Tri/Difluoromethyl Ketones from Carboxylic Acids via Cross&#8208;Coupling with Acyloxyphosphonium Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A simple and straightforward approach for the synthesis of trifluoromethyl&#8208; and difluoromethyl ketones from widely available carboxylic acids is disclosed. The transformation utilizes an acyloxyphosphonium ion as the active electrophile, conveniently generated in situ from the carboxylic acid substrate using commodity chemicals. The utility of the reaction system is exemplified by its chemoselectivity, with tolerance to a variety of important functional groups. The late&#8208;stage functionalization of carboxylic acid APIs and pharmaceutically relevant compounds is also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in the Syntheses and Catalytic Applications of Homonuclear Ru&#8208;, Rh&#8208;, and Ir&#8208;Complexes of CNHC^C Cyclometalated Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the past few decades, chemistry of cyclometalated species has gained momentum with increased applications in several areas of scientific developments. Cyclometalation reactions result in the formation of stable metalacycles through the generation of metal&#8208;carbon covalent bonds by activating the unreactive Csp2&#8208;H or Csp3&#8208;H bonds. The extra stability gained by the formation of metalacycles enhances their applicability scopes especially in the area of homogeneous catalysis. In the recent research development in this area, NHC ligands (strong  &#963;&#8208;donor and generally, weak  &#960;&#8208;acceptor) have been found to be one of the most suitable candidates for the intramolecular C&#8208;H activation process which leads to the cyclometalated species. The growth in the area of cyclometalation chemistry that started in the late 20th  century is still continuing and in the past few decades, various examples of NHC derived transition metal&#8208;based cyclometalated complexes came into the picture. As&#160;covering all the reported literatures in this area (includes mainly late transition metals) will exceed the limits of minireview, we restricted ourselves to the recent (2015 &#8208; May, 2021) examples of the most common Ru&#8208;, Rh&#8208;, and Ir&#8208;based CNHC^C cyclometalated complexes and their applications in various homogeneous catalytic conversions such as the transfer hydrogenation, amidation, oxidation of alcohols, annulations, etc.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Synthesis and Schlenk&#8208;Type Equilibrium of Cyclopentadienylmagnesium Bromides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the in situ Grignard metalation method (iGMM), the addition of bromoethane to a suspension of magnesium turnings and cyclopentadienes [C  5  H  6  (HCp), C  5  H  5  &#8208;Si(  i  Pr)  3  (HCp  TIPS  )] in diethyl ether smoothly yields heteroleptic [(Et  2  O)Mg(Cp  R  )(&#181;&#8208;Br)]  2  (Cp  R  = Cp (  1  ), Cp  TIPS  (  2  )). The Schlenk equilibrium of  2  in toluene leads to ligand exchange and formation of homoleptic [Mg(Cp  R  )  2  ] (  3  ) and [(Et  2  O)MgBr(&#181;&#8208;Br)]  2  (  4  ). Interfering solvation and aggregation as well as ligand redistribution equilibria hamper a quantitative elucidation of thermodynamic data for the Schlenk equilibrium of  2  in toluene. In ethereal solvents, mononuclear species [(Et  2  O)  2  Mg(Cp  TIPS  )Br] (  2&#8217;  ), [(Et  2  O)  n  Mg(Cp  TIPS  )  2  ] (  3&#8217;  ), and [(Et  2  O)  2  MgBr  2  ] (  4&#8217;  ) coexist. Larger coordination numbers can be realized with cyclic ethers like tetrahydropyran allowing crystallization of [(thp)  4  MgBr  2  ] (  5  ). The interpretation of the temperature&#8208;dependency of the Schlenk equilibrium constant in diethyl ether gives a reaction enthalpy &#916;H and reaction entropy &#916;S of &#8208;11.5 kJ mol  &#8208;1  and 60 J mol  &#8208;1  , respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Single amino&#8208;acid based self&#8208;assembled biomaterials with potent antimicrobial activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design and development of soft biomaterials based on amino acid and short&#8208;peptide have gained much attention due to their potent biomedical applications. A slight alteration in the side&#8208;chain of single amino acid in a peptide or protein sequence has a huge impact on the structure and function. Phenylalanine is one of the most studied amino acids, which contains an aromatic phenyl group connected through a flexible &#8211;CH  2  &#8208; unit. In this work, we have examined whether flexibility and aromatic functionality of phenylalanine (Phe) are important in gel formation of model gelator Fmoc&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH or not. To examine this hypothesis, we synthesized Fmoc&#8208;derivatives of three analogues unnatural amino acids including cyclohexylalanine, phenylglycine, and homophenylalanine; which are slightly varied from Phe. Interestingly, all these three new analogues formed hydrogels in phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 having different gelation efficacy and kinetics. This study suggests that the presence of aromatic side&#8208;chain and flexibility are not mandatory for the gelation of the model gelator. Newly synthesized unnatural amino acid derivatives have also exhibited promising antimicrobial activity towards gram&#8208;positive bacteria by inhibiting cellular oxygen consumption. We further determined the biocompatibility of these amino acid derivatives by using a hemolysis assay on human blood cells. Overall studies described the development of single amino acid&#8208;based new injectable biomaterials with improved antimicrobial activity by the slight alteration in the side&#8208;chain of amino acid.</dc:description>

         <title>Triaminocyclopentadienyl Ruthenium Complexes &#8211; New Catalysts for Cascade Conversions of Propargyl Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Various triaminocyclopentadienyl ruthenium complexes have been synthesized from Ru3(CO)12. The new complexes were tested for their ability to catalyze cascade conversions of propargyl alcohols. Their associated catalytic activities complement the activities of known diaminocyclopentadienone ruthenium complexes. In particular, the substrate scope of catalytic cycloadditions with 3&#8208;ketolactones or phloroglucinol derivatives is extended to terpenoid&#8208;derived propargyl alcohols containing an internal alkyne moiety. A wide range of cyclic terpenoid and phloroglucinol adducts are obtained by complementary application of both types of catalysts.</dc:description>
