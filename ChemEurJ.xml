         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Reduction of Propargyl Alcohols for the Synthesis of 1,3&#8208;Diarylallenes under N,N&#8208;Ligand and Hydride&#8208;free Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Allenes are a class of important organic compounds, and their synthesis has always been of great interest. In this article, we have developed a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed photoredox strategy, providing an alternative and efficient approach for the synthesis of 1,3&#8208;diarylallenes from propargyl alcohols. The reaction utilized organic amines as a hydrogen source to avoid the use of conventional hydride additives, and does not require the addition of extra ligands to activate the cobalt catalyst, achieving a mild reaction condition. As a result, the reaction was able to synthesize the desired 1,3&#8208;diarylallene compounds with good yields and functional group compatibility.</dc:description>

         <title>Nucleophilic Addition versus Migratory Insertion Pathways in the Gold&#8208;Catalysed Heck Reaction: A Computational Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The initial reaction steps in the formation of Heck&#8208;type arylated alkenes catalysed by P^N chelated Au(III) complexes have been studied computationally. Two mechanistic alternatives have been explored: (1) alkene coordination and insertion into a gold&#8208;carbon bond, and (2) nucleophilic attack on a gold(III) alkene adduct. The common starting point, the [(P^N)AuPh(alkene)]2+ dication (alkene = C2H4, H2C=CHEt or H2C=CEt2), shows unequal bonding to the olefinic carbons of the 1&#8208;alkenes (P^N = 1,2&#8208;C6H4NMe2(PR2); R = H, Me, 1&#8208;adamantyl). This polarisation increases with steric hindrance and with inclusion of an OTf&#8209; anion in the model. While the reaction pathways are strongly governed by the trans&#8208;influence of the ligand, the effects of steric hindrance in the ligand and alkene are remarkably small. In all cases the nucleophilic attack pathway is energetically favoured. However, changing the ligand from a P^N to a P^P chelate, with a strongly electron&#8208;donating &#8208;PMe2 donor trans to Ph, sufficiently destabilises the Au&#8208;Ph bond to make alkene insertion competitive. Alkene 1,2 insertion regiochemistry is always preferred, unlike Pd&#8208;catalysed Heck reaction that requires a 2,1&#8208;insertion. Based on these results, an alkene insertion pathway en&#8208;route to Heck&#8208;type olefins can therefore be ruled out.</dc:description>

         <title>Advances in Copper and Nickel C&#8208;N and C&#8208;O Cross&#8208;Couplings of (Hetero)Aryl Chlorides Enabled by Ancillary Ligand Development</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The evolution of palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;N and C&#8208;O cross&#8208;coupling chemistry into first&#8208;choice methods for the synthesis of aniline and phenol derivatives can be attributed to innovations in ancillary ligand design that facilitate challenging elementary steps of thermal catalysis. Inspired by this strategy, and in the quest to establish more sustainable thermal base metal catalysis that is competitive with and complementary to such precious metal protocols, several successful mechanism&#8208;inspired ancillary ligand classes for use in enabling high&#8208;performing copper and nickel catalysts have emerged over the last decade. In this Review we document key ancillary ligand advances of this type, with a focus on superlative copper and nickel catalysts that enable C&#8208;N or C&#8208;O cross&#8208;couplings of cheap and abundant (hetero)aryl chloride electrophiles under operationally simple conditions of relevance to end&#8208;users in academia and industry.</dc:description>

         <title>Skeletal Editing of Alkenes and Alkynes via Single&#8208;Carbon&#8208;Atom Insertion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically surveys progress since 2017 in single&#8208;carbon insertion into alkenes and alkynes, emphasizing mechanistic insights, substrate scope, and synthetic utility. We highlight key methodologies, discuss unresolved challenges, and outline future directions for this rapidly evolving field, with potential applications in complex molecule synthesis and functional material design.








Abstract
Skeletal editing has emerged as a pivotal complement to retrosynthetic analysis strategies. This approach enables simple bulk chemical feedstocks to achieve precise atomic&#8208;level modifications&#8212;such as insertion, deletion, or swapping&#8212;facilitating the rapid assembly of complex, high value&#8208;added functional organic molecules. Currently, single&#8208;carbon&#8208;atom insertion reactions predominantly emphasize the functionalization of (hetero)aromatic systems, leaving the site&#8208;specific editing of unsaturated C&#9472;C bond frameworks such as alkenes and alkynes, comparatively underexplored. This review provides detailed analysis and summary of recent progress in the skeletal editing of functional alkenes and alkynes derivatives via single&#8208;carbon&#8208;atom insertion, and outlining the future potential directions of this technology.

         <title>Biodegradable Elastomers: Where Is the Solution?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective explores the scientific and translational challenges in developing biodegradable elastomers as sustainable alternatives to traditional rubbers. It highlights polysaccharide&#8208;based architectures, dynamic covalent and supramolecular chemistries, and the trade&#8208;offs between durability and degradation. Emphasis is placed on aligning material design with regulatory frameworks, public education, and STEM integration to scale real&#8208;world, environmentally responsible solutions.








Abstract
The last three decades have witnessed a paradigm shift in the polymer industry, driven by the urgent need for sustainable materials. Growing awareness of environmental sustainability, coupled with increasingly stringent chemical regulations, has catalyzed significant investments in sustainable polymer materials. While much of the focus has been on plastics, rubbery materials have received comparatively less attention. With mechanical and chemical recycling as the current primary mode for disposing rubber waste, prospects for a suitable pathway to minimize hazardous microplastics derived from these highly crosslinked polymers sources seem bleak. This article aims to envision a future where the pathway toward biodegradable rubber materials becomes a more realistic possibility. We delve into the challenges, advancements, and future perspectives of biodegradable rubbery materials, with a particular emphasis on exploring the potential of utilizing polysaccharides derived from biomass combined with synthetic elastomers &#8211; including the utilization of dynamic covalent bonding and supramolecular chemistry approaches. In addition to the discussion on scientific questions, we address complementary issues on STEM education to put forth a more comprehensive vision for sustainability relating to broader society.

         <title>Reactivity of &#948;&#8208;Functionalized Para&#8208;Quinone Methides in Nucleophilic Addition Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivities of &#948;&#8208;functionalized para&#8208;quinone methides (pQMs) were characterized by kinetic studies of their reactions with carbanions in DMSO. Evaluating the second&#8208;order rate constants (k2) by the Mayr&#8208;Patz equation gave the electrophilicities E of pQMs. Reactivities of unseen &#948;&#8208;functionalized pQMs can be predicted by using the linear relationship of E with a combination of quantum chemically calculated methyl anion affinities (MAA) and buried volumes (%Vbur).








Abstract
The electrophilic reactivities of para&#8208;quinone methides (pQMs) with functional groups (FG) at the exocyclic polarized carbon&#8211;carbon double bond were determined by photometrically monitoring the kinetics of their reactions with carbanions in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 20 &#176;C. The experimental second&#8208;order rate constants k2 were evaluated by the Mayr&#8208;Patz equation, that is, the linear free energy relationship lg k2&#160;=&#160;sN(N&#160;+&#160;E), which was leveraged to determine the electrophilicity descriptors E of the pQMs. These electrophilicity parameters E were subsequently used to successfully predict the scope of the pQM reactions with C&#8208;, H&#8208;, N&#8208;, O&#8208;, and S&#8208;centered nucleophiles. Moreover, the electrophilicity parameters E correlate linearly with a linear combination of quantum&#8208;chemically calculated methyl anion affinities (MAAs) and buried volumes (%Vbur). While MAA values mainly reflect the thermodynamic driving force of the carbon&#8211;carbon bond formation, %Vbur values take account of the variable steric effects of substituents at the electrophilic &#948;&#8208;position of the pQMs. Knowledge of MAA and %Vbur thus enables chemists to tailor novel pQMs with predictable reactivity properties.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electrophilic reactivities of &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-quinone methides (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;QMs) with functional groups (FG) at the exocyclic polarized carbon&#8211;carbon double bond were determined by photometrically monitoring the kinetics of their reactions with carbanions in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 20 &#176;C. The experimental second-order rate constants &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; were evaluated by the Mayr-Patz equation, that is, the linear free energy relationship lg &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;=&#160;&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;N&#160;&lt;/i&gt;+&#160;&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;), which was leveraged to determine the electrophilicity descriptors &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt; of the &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;QMs. These electrophilicity parameters &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt; were subsequently used to successfully predict the scope of the &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;QM reactions with C-, H-, N-, O-, and S-centered nucleophiles. Moreover, the electrophilicity parameters &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt; correlate linearly with a linear combination of quantum-chemically calculated methyl anion affinities (MAAs) and buried volumes (%&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;bur&lt;/sub&gt;). While MAA values mainly reflect the thermodynamic driving force of the carbon&#8211;carbon bond formation, %&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>Benzo&#8208;Extended Thiaquasi[7]Circulenes: Strategic Scholl&#8208;Type Synthesis, Tunable Electronic, and Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through Scholl oxidative cyclization, we efficiently synthesize unique &#960;&#8208;conjugated TQCs in high yield. These molecules feature a negatively curved geometry, bifacial aromatic&#8211;antiaromatic character, and tunable optoelectronic properties with enhanced fluorescence and mechanochromic luminescence. Their exceptional redox activity and electrochemical stability make TQCs promising for organic electronics and energy storage.








Abstract
Thia&#8208;quasi[7]circulenes (TQCs) are a novel class of &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules exhibiting unique electronic, optical, and electrochemical properties. We report a highly efficient bottom&#8208;up synthesis of TQCs via Scholl oxidative cyclization, achieving exceptional yields and structural precision. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis confirms their negatively curved geometry, featuring a central antiaromatic heptagonal core and a surrounding aromatic rim, leading to bifacial electronic properties. TQCs demonstrate stable redox behavior with tunable Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO)&#8211;Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) energy levels. Their remarkable electrochemical stability highlights potential as redox&#8208;active materials. TQCs exhibit blue&#8208;shifted fluorescence compared to carbo&#8208;quasi[7]circulenes, with enhanced quantum yields upon benzoannulation. Additionally, they display mechanochromic luminescence upon grinding, revealing tunable molecular characteristics. These findings establish TQCs as versatile molecular frameworks, bridging fundamental chemistry and next&#8208;generation functional materials, making them promising candidates for organic electronics, energy storage, and optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Influence of Compactness and Crystallinity on Hole Transfer Ability of Nickel Oxide Layer in Modal Coupling Regime</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates how structural properties influence the hole migration behavior of nickel oxide (NiOx). Our findings reveal that both crystallinity and compactness significantly affect the hole transport capability of NiOx layers. The Au&#8208;NPs/NiOx/Pt&#8208;film photocathode exhibited cathodic photocurrent at wavelengths below 800&#160;nm, with a maximum incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency of 0.16% at 600&#160;nm.








Abstract
This study investigates how structural properties influence the hole migration behavior of nickel oxide (NiOx) by evaluating its photoelectrochemical performance. Two fabrication methods were employed for preparing NiOx layers. One is a sol&#8208;gel wet process, which allows wide&#8208;area coating without the need for specialized equipment. The other is atomic layer deposition (ALD), which enables uniform and conformal coverage on 3D surfaces with the compact oxide layer by leveraging a self&#8208;limiting, layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth mechanism. Our findings reveal that both crystallinity and compactness significantly affect the hole transport capability of NiOx layers. We further integrated the NiOx layer as a hole transport layer in an Au&#8208;NPs/NiOx/Pt&#8208;film photocathode operating under a modal coupling regime. This photocathode exhibited cathodic photocurrent at wavelengths below 800&#160;nm, with a maximum incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency of 0.16% at 600&#160;nm. These results demonstrate that not only the hole injection process but also hole migration properties of the NiOx layer influence the charge separation under modal coupling conditions.

         <title>Li Heteroepitaxial Deposition on Single Crystalline Ni Substrates With Enhanced Cycling Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The heteroepitaxial Li deposition occurs on single&#8208;crystalline Ni(110) substrates, exhibiting the same {110}&lt;001&gt;&#160;texture with the substrate and a planar morphology. Using the {110}&#8208;textured epitaxial layer as the Li anode, the Li||LiPeO4 full cell presents improved cycle life, compared with the {111}&#8208;textured Li anode and untextured Li anode.








Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal is recognized as a highly promising anode material for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries. Nonetheless, dendrite growth and low coulombic efficiency (CE) significantly impede the practical application of Li metal anodes. The deposition morphology and chemical stability of Li are intricately linked to its crystallographic orientation. This study presents a substrate engineering approach that employs single&#8208;crystalline nickel (Ni) to facilitate epitaxial Li deposition due to their excellent lattice matching. The findings reveal that the Ni(110) substrate exhibits a more pronounced heteroepitaxial effect than Ni(111). A robust {110}&#8208;textured Li deposition was prepared on Ni(110) with a uniform planar morphology due to the lower Li self&#8208;diffusion barrier on the Li(110) plane. The {110}&#8208;textured Li epitaxial deposition improves the cycling stability in Ni&#8208;Li cells and full cells. Notably, the Li||LiFePO4 full cell utilizing the {110}&#8208;textured Li anode exhibits a high capacity retention of 109.6 mAh cm&#8722;2 over 350 cycles at 1 C under a low negative&#8208;to&#8208;positive capacity ratio of 1.26. This investigation highlights the crucial role of substrate&#8208;induced heteroepitaxy in improving Li plating/stripping dynamics and provides insights for the development of stable Li metal anodes by crystallographic orientation modification.

         <dc:description>We report an efficient double&#8208;click strategy combining copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) with (thia&#8208;)Diels&#8211;Alder (DA) reactions, enabled by newly designed heterobifunctional platforms bearing orthogonal clickable groups: alkyne&#8211;dithioester, alkyne&#8211;maleimide, or azide&#8211;diene. These platforms were evaluated through both one&#8208;pot sequential protocols (CuAAC/DA or CuAAC/thia&#8208;DA) and three&#8208;component reactions (3CR), using model substrates with complementary functionalities. The use of a highly reactive s&#8208;cis&#8208;constrained exocyclic diene, enabled rapid cycloadditions with maleimide or phosphonodithioester dienophiles. All reactions were performed under mild, biocompatible conditions (37&#8239;&#176;C, 1:1 H&#8322;O/iPrOH, 1&#8208;2&#8239;h), and most afforded the desired conjugates in good isolated yields. The methodology was further validated through the successful bioconjugation of three small peptides with either a fluorophore or biotin, demonstrating its efficiency, versatility, and compatibility with biologically relevant functional groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Single Sodium&#8208;Ion Conducting Sulfonated Polytriazole and Composite Electrolyte Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ongoing energy crisis and the increasing demand for lithium metal batteries (LMBs) have raised concerns about the availability and affordability of lithium. In light of their abundance and lower production costs, sodium metal batteries (SMBs) have the potential to replace LMBs. However, due to the reactivity of organic electrolytes with the sodium anode, it is essential to design safer electrolytes to prevent short&#8208;circuiting. This study focuses on the design and evaluation of fillers and single&#8208;ion conducting polymer electrolytes (SICPEs), including Na&#8208;SGO, PTSICPE&#8208;90, and various blend composites, which outperform Celgard 2400 in terms of thermal, mechanical, and dimensional stability. The Na&#8208;SGO filler demonstrated a desirable Na&#8208;ion conductivity of 11.91 &#215; 10&#8208;2 Scm&#8208;1 at 90 &#176;C in a solvated state. Due to the high solvent absorption (70 wt.%), good wettability (22.2&#176;), and significant porosity (58%) of the SICPEs, notable Na&#8208;ion conductivities of 0.23 &#215; 10&#8208;5 Scm&#8208;1 (non&#8208;solvated at 30 &#176;C) and 1.17 &#215; 10&#8208;5 Scm&#8208;1 (solvated at 40 &#176;C) were observed. These properties make them an appealing choice for electrolytic applications in SMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Ru&#8208;catalyzed mechanochemical trifluoromethylation of arylboronic acids and phenols via in situ generated N&#8208;trifluoromethylpyridinium salt as CF3 source</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a mechanochemical approach for the ruthenium catalyzed trifluoromethylation of arylboronic acids and phenols under the synergy of trifluoromethylacetamide and pyrylium tetrafluoroborate (Pyry&#8208;BF&#8324;). This is the first ever report on trifluoromethylation using in situ generated of N&#8208;trifluoromethylpyridinium tetrafluoroborate as the CF3 source under ball&#8208;milling conditions. The present one&#8208;pot transformation enabled direct trifluoromethylation of arylboronic acids and phenols to deliver the respective trifluoromethyl arenes and aryl trifluoromethyl ethers. It has also shown a remarkable compatibility toward aroyltrifluoroborates for the mechanochemical synthesis of aryl trifluoromethyl ketones. This method offers several advantages, including operational simplicity and broad substrate compatibility. Moreover, the current mechanochemical approach not only proceeds under sustainable conditions but also provides a practical route for the late&#8208;stage modifications of related substrates to access the valuable fluorinated compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Ring Cleavage for Ring Construction: Oxidative Heterocyclic Segregation toward Tribenzophenanthrolines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Let's scrap and build! Skeletal editing induced by two&#8208;electron oxidation of selenadiazole&#8208;fused quinodimethane enables preparative&#8208;scale synthesis of hexacyclic derivatives of phenanthroline, which afford fluorescent metal complexes. In this process, the two nitrogen atoms within a single heterocycle in the starting material are segregated into two different ring systems in the product.








Abstract
Intramolecular double C&#9472;N bond formation followed by deselenylation enables a one&#8208;pot skeletal editing of selenadiazole&#8208;fused naphthoquinodimethanes into previously unknown tribenzophenanthroline derivatives, which serve as precursors to fluorescent metal complexes. This transformation involves the disappearance of the original selenadiazole ring containing two nitrogen atoms and the concurrent formation of two new pyridine rings, each containing a single nitrogen atom. This &#8220;heterocyclic segregation (Het&#8208;Seg)&#8221; reaction is triggered by two&#8208;electron oxidation of sterically congested quinodimethane substrates with a folded geometry. The resulting twisted dicationic intermediates are crucial for driving the unique skeletal reorganization.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled Ni&#8208;C Bond Formation via Selective Gas&#8208;Phase C&#8722;C Bond Cleavage in 1,3&#8208;Diketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanistic investigations into the selective cleavage of C&#8722;C bonds to form M&#8722;C (M: metal) bonds are crucial for the comprehension, optimization, and design of chemical reactions. In this study, collision&#8208;induced dissociation experiments reveal that [(phen)NiL]+ (where L and phen represent a 1,3&#8208;diketone ligand and 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, respectively) cations facilitate the selective cleavage of C&#8722;C bonds, leading to the formation of alkyl&#8208;metal ions possessing M&#8722;C bonds. In contrast, the [NiL]+ cation, without the phen ligand, produces small neutral molecules, such as CH4, CO, and C6H6. Theoretical calculations suggest that a decarboxylation&#8208;like mechanism is responsible for the generation of the M&#8722;C bond in [(phen)Ni(bac)]+ (bac = benzoylacetone). Although the phen ligand is not directly involved in the fragmentation of nickel complex cations, it significantly alters the electronic structures and fragmentation mechanisms of nickel complex cations. This work presents a novel approach for the generation of M&#8722;C bonds through a gas&#8208;phase method, and provides molecular&#8208;level insights into the selective cleavage of C&#8722;C bonds in homogeneous catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Orthogonal Photoswitching in Nematic Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoresponsive liquid crystals can be obtained by doping with molecular photoswitches. Photoisomerization results in a fast and reversible transition between the&#160;nematic liquid crystalline and isotropic liquid phase. Simultaneous doping with two orthogonal photoswitches enables optical manipulation of the liquid crystal using selected wavelength ranging from ultraviolet to near infrared light.








Abstract
Photoresponsive materials capable of orthogonal and path&#8208;independent switching are crucial for developing adaptive materials and smart technologies. In this work, we showcase a dual light&#8208;responsive nematic liquid crystalline system based on peri&#8208;anthracenethioindigo (PAT) and arylazopyrazole (AAP) doped into the liquid crystal 4&#8208;cyano&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;pentylbiphenyl (5CB). The co&#8208;assembled supramolecular material exhibits a reversible phase transition between the nematic liquid crystalline and isotropic liquid state upon irradiation with different wavelengths of light ranging from ultraviolet to near infrared. These transformations are clearly visible using polarized optical microscopy, displaying either bright birefringent or completely dark images depending on the phase state. A key feature of this system is its ability to achieve independent and highly efficient photoisomerization of both photoswitches, ensuring orthogonality and path independence in solution as well as in the liquid crystalline phase. This orthogonal switching capability enables precise and reversible modulation of material properties, allowing sequential interconversion between multiple distinct states. Such a system represents an important proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for future multifunctional materials that leverage light as a noninvasive external stimulus.

         <title>Dual Excitation and Dual Emission in a 1,4&#8208;Diazepine Bearing an Extended &#960;&#8208;System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclodehydrogenation of a previously reported nanographene BDI leads to the formation of a 1,4&#8208;diazepine via scandium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H bond formation. This compound exhibits a unique combination of dual excitation and dual emission. The dual emission was found to be caused by a combination of charge transfer and geometric relaxation in the excited state.








Abstract
We present the synthesis of a benzo[b]benzo[11,12]tetracene[5,6&#8208;ef][1,4]diazepine (BBTDZ) and a benzo[g]phenanthro[9,10,1&#8208;cde]indazolium (BPIZ), two novel N&#8208;heterocyclic nanographenes. Both molecules were independently isolated from 2,3&#8208;Dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ)&#8208;mediated cyclodehydrogenation reaction of the previously reported benzo[f,g]tetracene &#946;&#8208;diketiminate (BT&#8208;BDI). Our mechanistic investigation shows the instrumental role of Sc(OTf)3 in allowing for C&#9472;N bond formation over N&#9472;N bond formation. Unexpectedly, the BBTDZ compound shows unique dual emission and dual excitation (DE/DE) properties. A combination of spectroscopic and computational studies provides a rationalization of these features. Charge transfer followed by geometric relaxation were found to cause the dual, strongly red&#8208;shifted emission. The understanding of both the reaction mechanism and mechanism of DE/DE can contribute to the rational design of materials with unique photophysical properties.

&lt;p&gt;We present the synthesis of a benzo[b]benzo[11,12]tetracene[5,6-ef][1,4]diazepine (BBTDZ) and a benzo[g]phenanthro[9,10,1-cde]indazolium (BPIZ), two novel N-heterocyclic nanographenes. Both molecules were independently isolated from 2,3-Dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ)-mediated cyclodehydrogenation reaction of the previously reported benzo[f,g]tetracene &#946;-diketiminate (BT-BDI). Our mechanistic investigation shows the instrumental role of Sc(OTf)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in allowing for C&#9472;N bond formation over N&#9472;N bond formation. Unexpectedly, the BBTDZ compound shows unique dual emission and dual excitation (DE/DE) properties. A combination of spectroscopic and computational studies provides a rationalization of these features. Charge transfer followed by geometric relaxation were found to cause the dual, strongly red-shifted emission. The understanding of both the reaction mechanism and mechanism of DE/DE can contribute to the rational design of materials with unique photophysical properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

From fleeting intermediates to well&#8208;defined molecular structures, carbenes (neutral divalent carbon) remind us that the most reactive ideas often make a large impact. Despite their wide&#8208;ranging applications, the direct characterization of these reactive species remains a persistent experimental challenge. This concept article explores widely adopted strategies for their detection and structural elucidation, highlighting both their capabilities and limitations.

         <title>Significant Enhancement in Performance and Durability of Near&#8208;Infrared Reflective Flexible Triboelectric Nanogenerators Through Surface Modification Strategy via Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a surface modification strategy for boosting performance and durability of ITO&#8208;free flexible TENG via self&#8208;assembled monolayers, yielding record&#8208;high power density (27.28&#160;W/m2) and excellent durability upon 5,000 times of bending. Moreover, through optical design for the electrode, our TENG can unprecedentedly exhibit reduced heat gain from solar radiation.








Abstract
Although triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG) have been explored as a promising candidate for applications in multifunctional intelligent systems, the realization of highly efficient TENG that synchronously possess reasonable light transparency, high near&#8208;infrared reflectivity against solar heat gain, and good mechanical flexibility still remains challenging. Here, we present a reliable strategy that can substantially boost the performance and durability of indium tin oxide (ITO)&#8208;free transparent flexible TENG by surface modification via self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAM). Through the modification of Sb2O3/Ag/Sb2O3 electrode and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) dielectric layer with SAM of 12&#8208;(dodecylphosphonic acid) triethyl ammonium bromide and perfluorinated molecules, respectively, triboelectric charge generation is facilitated due to relatively large work function (WF) difference between the tribolayers. The resulting flexible TENG not only afford record&#8208;breaking power density (27.28&#160;W/m2) for ITO&#8208;free transparent flexible TENG, but also possess high durability against 5,000 cycles of bending owing to good adhesion at the SAM/substrate interfaces and high robustness of electrode. More encouragingly, the use of Sb2O3/Ag/Sb2O3 electrode endows TENG with both reasonable light transparency and high near&#8208;infrared reflectivity, which is beneficial against heat gain from solar radiation. This work showcases a promising route towards realizing transparent flexible TENG with high performance and durability, which represents a new platform for the design of next&#8208;generation wearable electronics.

         <title>Chemical Valence of Metal Impurity in Single&#8208;Wall Carbon Nanotubes Dominate Their Cytotoxicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synchrotron radiation&#8208;based analytical techniques are applied to characterize chemical species of metal impurities in single&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and to map intracellular accumulation of SWCNTs. The SWCNTs containing higher amounts of metal impurities such as Fe0 and Co0 are found to generate higher hydroxyl radicals and induce stronger cytotoxicity. Therefore, chemical valence rather than the quantity of metal impurities in SWCNTs dominates cytotoxicity.









Abstract
Metal impurities are believed to play a role in carbon nanotube (CNT) toxicity, however, redox properties of metal impurities can vary remarkably. It thus becomes necessary to investigate whether altered chemical valence of metal impurities in CNTs elicits diverse cytotoxicity effects. Studies on this issue are scarce partly due to the technical challenges of characterizing the chemical valence of metal impurities. Herein, synchrotron radiation&#8208;based technology was applied to qualify and quantify the chemical species and valence of metal impurities in two single wall CNTs and to in situ map intracellular metal distribution after CNT exposure. Surprisingly, the CNT containing a much lower amount of metal displayed significantly higher cytotoxicity compared with the higher metal one. Further analysis indicated that the CNT with lower metal content possessed higher amounts of zero&#8208;valent iron (Fe0) and cobalt (Co0). Results from electron spin resonance spectroscopy further confirmed that CNT with lower metal content generated more hydroxyl radicals, which was attributed to the high amounts of Fe0 and Co0. Taken together, our findings with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art synchrotron radiation techniques demonstrated that chemical valence rather than the quantity of metal impurities in CNTs determine their cytotoxicity, thereby revealing a novel aspect of the cytotoxicity mechanism of CNTs.

A facile synthesis of unsymmetrical 1,1&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted ferrocene derivatives based on the desymmetrization of 1,1&#8217;&#8208;diborylferrocene was developed. Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling (SMCC) reaction of 1,1&#8217;&#8208;diborylferrocene afforded mono&#8208;substituted products without significant loss of the second boryl group, and the subsequent second SMCC reaction afforded the desired unsymmetrical 1,1&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted ferrocene derivatives. This method provides a versatile synthetic platform for tuning the electronic and steric properties of functional ferrocene derivatives.








Abstract
Unsymmetrical 1,1&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted ferrocene is a versatile scaffold for various functional molecules, including organic electronics, catalysts, and bioactive molecules. Herein, we report a facile synthesis of unsymmetrical 1,1&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted ferrocene derivatives based on the desymmetrization of 1,1&#8217;&#8208;diborylferrocene. We found that Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling (SMCC) reaction using 1,1&#8217;&#8208;bis(Bpin)ferrocene affords the mono&#8208;substituted product without significant loss of the second boryl group. Then, second SMCC reaction of the obtained 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8217;&#8208;(Bpin)ferrocene affords the desired unsymmetrical 1,1&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted ferrocene derivatives in reasonable yields. This method provides a versatile synthetic platform for tuning the electronic and steric properties of functional ferrocene derivatives and for the structural development of bioactive compounds.

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Directed Structure&#8208;Specific Carbon Nanothreads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon nanothread (CNTh) is a family of 1D diamond&#8208;like materials, which was predicted to have extremely high strength, stiffness, and tenacity, but suffered from its disordered intrathread bonding. By a nonsymmetric F&#8208;substitution on benzene, we synthesized atom&#8208;scale ordered CNTh with specific structure out of many isomeric competitors. Our work paved the way to the precise construction of diamond&#8208;like material.








Abstract
Carbon nanothread (CNTh) is a sp3&#8208;bonded one&#8208;dimensional nanomaterial that was predicted to combine the extreme strength with excellent flexibility. However, the reported CNTh usually has a nonuniform intrathread structure, and the synthesis of structure&#8208;specific CNTh is still a big challenge. Here, we selected 1,2,3&#8208;trifluorobenzene (1,2,3&#8208;TFB) with strong dipole as a precursor. By compressing 1,2,3&#8208;TFB to 20.1&#160;GPa, a CNTh with a &#8220;zipper polymer&#8221; structure is obtained.

     alt="Fluorine-Directed Structure-Specific Carbon Nanothreads"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbon nanothread (CNTh) is a family of 1D diamond-like materials, which was predicted to have extremely high strength, stiffness, and tenacity, but suffered from its disordered intrathread bonding. By a nonsymmetric F-substitution on benzene, we synthesized atom-scale ordered CNTh with specific structure out of many isomeric competitors. Our work paved the way to the precise construction of diamond-like material.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbon nanothread (CNTh) is a sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-bonded one-dimensional nanomaterial that was predicted to combine the extreme strength with excellent flexibility. However, the reported CNTh usually has a nonuniform intrathread structure, and the synthesis of structure-specific CNTh is still a big challenge. Here, we selected 1,2,3-trifluorobenzene (1,2,3-TFB) with strong dipole as a precursor. By compressing 1,2,3-TFB to 20.1&#160;GPa, a CNTh with a &#8220;zipper polymer&#8221; structure is obtained. Under applied pressure, 1,2,3-TFB are anti-parallelly stacked in column, and polymerize via selective sequential [4&#160;+&#160;2] polymerization between H-carbon dienophile/F-carbon dienophile and F, H-carbon diene within the column, followed by the &#8220;zippered&#8221; bonding of the rest atoms. The obtained CNTh is highly hydrophobic with contact angle of 124.6&#176;. The excellent columnar anti-parallel &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; stacking and distinct reactivities of carbon atoms introduced by the F-substitution are responsible for the high reaction selectivity, which provides new insight for the precise synthesis of atom-level ordered CNThs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fine&#8208;tuning the Photochemistry of Sulfur&#8208;Based Linkages with Ruthenium(II) Polypyridyl Complexes for Optimal PACT Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemistry of thioether&#8208;and sulfoxide&#8208;based Ru&#8208;S&#8208;linkages in ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complexes was studied for fine&#8208;tuning their application in PACT. The higher photocytotoxicity of thioether&#8208;Ru(II) polypyridyls was correlated to the facile photorelease of thioethers compared to sulfoxide ligands.








Abstract
The thioether&#8208;based monodentate ligands are reported to be efficient photoreleasable groups from Ru(II)&#8208;photocages designed for photoactivated chemotherapy (PACT). However, the direct comparison and systematic studies of the photochemical behavior of sulfur linkages of varied electronic/oxidation states, i.e., sulfoxides, thioethers, or thiols coordinated with Ru(II)&#8208;polypyridyls, remain unexplored. To delve into the intricate photochemistry of Ru(II)&#8208;S linkages, two Ru(II)&#8208;polypyridyls: [Ru(ttpy)(phen)(DMSO)](PF6)2 [1](PF6)2 and [Ru(ttpy)(phen)(DAS)](PF6)2 [2](PF6)2, [ttpy&#160;=&#160;4&#8242;&#8208;tolyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8243;&#8208;terpyridine, phen&#160;=&#160;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, DAS&#160;=&#160;diallyl sulfide, DMSO&#160;=&#160;dimethyl sulfoxide] were synthesized. Here, we used DMSO for the typical sulfoxide linkage, while DAS a biologically potent phytochemical, probed as a thioether linkage with Ru(II). The photosolvolysis monitored by UV/Vis and 1H NMR studies with white LED in CH3CN indicated more facile substitution of DAS than that of DMSO. The water&#8208;soluble [1](NO3)2 and [2](NO3)2 exhibited facile photorelease of DAS than DMSO from {Ru(ttpy)(phen)}2+&#8208;photocages in water. The cytotoxicity and photocytotoxicity studies with HeLa and Caco2 cells showed that [2](PF6)2 and [2](NO3)2 were more photocytotoxic with higher photoindices (PI) compared to [1](PF6)2 and [1](NO3)2. This apparently led to the conclusion that markedly facile photorelease of DAS resulted in higher photocytotoxicity of the DAS&#8208;based complexes. Therefore, thioether&#8208;based Ru(II)&#8208;polypyridyls portray better options for photocaging of prodrugs and PACT applications.

         <title>Phase Selective Synthesis of SBT and FAU&#8208;SBT&#8208;SBS Intergrown Zeolites Using Asymmetric Organic Structure&#8208;Directing Agents for Upgrading of Polyethylene Pyrolysis Oil</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic structure directing agents (OSDAs) based on asymmetric di&#8208;quaternary ammonia compounds have been rarely explored in crystallization of zeolites, owing to difficulties in structural control. Their use holds promise to regulate physicochemical properties of zeolitic materials towards enhancing the relevant catalytic performances. In this study, a stepwise alkylation of 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (Dab) to generate asymmetric di&#8208;quaternary derivatives has been established, enabling their use as OSDAs in large pore zeolite synthesis. Through exploratory syntheses, we showed that small Me&#8208;Dab&#8208;Et can direct the formation of SBT zeolite in multiple inorganic cation (Cs+&#8208;Na+) crystallization, while the bulky Me&#8208;Dab&#8208;iPr and Me&#8208;Dab&#8208;sBu lead to the formation of FAU&#8208;SBT&#8208;SBS intergrowths. The obtained SBT zeolite exhibited higher olefin selectivity in catalytic upgrading of pyrolysis oil derived from polyethylene, with respect to alike cage&#8208;containing faujasite (FAU) zeolite. Our findings expand the library of asymmetric di&#8208;quaternary OSDAs and highlight their capability to achieve phase selective synthesis of large pore zeolites.</dc:description>

         <title>Chirality in Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 35, June 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emergence of chirality in inorganic nanostructures has a critical impact on the properties and potential applications of these novel nanomaterials. This work presents a critical collection of examples of the observation of chirality in TMDs, covering different synthetic procedures and origins of chirality as well as a broad range of dimensionality from 0D dots to complex 3D nanostructures.








Abstract
The fascinating properties introduced by the breaking of mirror symmetry have recently motivated a rising interest in chirality in nanomaterials. In particular, transition metal (TM) dichalcogenides (TMDs) are a wide group of technologically relevant 2D layered materials where recent efforts in the introduction of chirality have shown promising results, attracting great attention for future studies and potential applications. This review article is focused on the development of chirality in TM dichalcogenide nanostructures, dealing with the synthetic strategies that have been adopted to produce chiral TMDs both via solution&#8208;phase and vapor&#8208;phase syntheses along with the characterization of their chiroptical properties. A broad range of examples, including a variety of nanostructures such as 0D quantum dots (QDs), 1D nanotubes, 2D flakes, and more complex 3D nanostructures as well as different origins of chirality are considered. Critical analysis of potential pitfalls in the assessment of the materials&#8217; chirality are discussed. A broad range of exciting properties and applications associated with the materials&#8217; chirality, including: nanomedicine, enantioselective catalysis, spin&#8208;dependent electrocatalysis, spintronics, and nonlinear optics, are also presented in the review.

         <title>Artificial Light&#8208;Driven Ion Pumps</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 35, June 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent breakthroughs in artificial light&#8208;driven ion pumps, with a focus on two distinct mechanisms: photoelectric&#8208;driven transport and molecular phototransduction. It explores key design principles, including material selection and nanostructuring strategies, and critically evaluates performance metrics such as pumping rates, directionality, and fatigue resistance.








Abstract
Nature's molecular machinery has long provided inspiration for the development of functional materials, with natural ion pumps exemplifying the efficient conversion of solar energy into directional ion transport. This process is crucial for cellular signaling, bioenergy conversion, and photosynthesis. Motivated by these biological systems, artificial light&#8208;driven ion pumps have emerged as transformative technologies for sustainable energy harvesting, desalination, and bioelectronic innovations. This review categorizes synthetic light&#8208;driven ion pumps into two primary mechanistic paradigms: (1) photoelectric&#8208;driven transport, which leverages photoinduced charge separation in semiconductor structures, and (2) molecular phototransduction, which utilizes light&#8208;induced isomerization or conformational changes in photoactive molecules. For each paradigm, we trace their biomimetic origins to natural ion transport mechanisms, followed by a detailed analysis of design strategies, operational principles, and material innovations. These innovations range from dynamic photoresponsive molecules and semiconductors to semiconductor heterostructures, all of which enable precise control over ion selectivity, flux, and energy conversion in a spatiotemporal manner. Finally, we discuss the emerging applications of light&#8208;driven ion pumps and the remaining challenges for their practical implementation.

         <title>Aggregation, Photoluminescence, and Cytotoxicity of Pt(II) and Re(I) Complexes Bearing Multimodal&#8208;Coordinating Luminophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 35, June 23, 2025. </description>

A polydentate ligand with multiple coordination patterns (bidentate N*N&#8208;mode for Pt(II) and Re(I) centers, tridentate C^N*N&#8208;motive for Pt(II)&#8208;based complexes) is herein presented. The attained coordination&#8208;chemical versatility in combination with different co&#8208;ligands was employed to achieve sophisticated structural features and tunable photophysical properties, including&#160;aggregation and cytotoxicity.








Abstract
In this study, a polydentate ligand capable of adopting multiple coordination modes (N*N, C^N*N, and C^N*N^C) was established. Depending on the chelation conditions and the co&#8208;ligand used in the subsequent steps, nine complexes became accessible. The four Pt(II)&#8208;based species with N*N&#8208;coordination motif show tunable emission and cytotoxicity. Two Pt(II) complexes with C^N*N&#8208;type coordination were also obtained, and the exchange of the co&#8208;ligand from chlorido to cyanido led to an enhancement in the photoluminescence quantum yield from &lt;0.02 to 0.55. These compounds exhibit distinct solid&#8208;state characteristics associated with Pt&#8943;Pt&#8208;interactions. Interestingly, the tetradentate C^N*N^C&#8208;coordination mode was not accessible, most likely due to kinetic reasons and insolubility&#8208;related purification hurdles. However, the use of a N*N&#8208;coordination mode for a Re(I) center yielded non&#8208;cytotoxic 3MLCT&#8208;state emitters. The multifaceted coordination modes available with the luminophoric ligand enable the design and realization of diverse metal complexes with tailored cytotoxicity and tendency towards intermolecular coupling, both in solution and in crystalline phases.

         <title>Multifunctional Nano&#8208;COF&#8208;Embedded Silica Composite for Efficient Photocatalytic NADH Regeneration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 35, June 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel composite material integrating &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked nano TPTTA COFs and a rhodium complex electron mediator into a mesoporous silica matrix is reported for photocatalytic NADH regeneration. This design enhances electron transfer, achieving a 75.7% NADH yield, 89.8% selectivity, and an initial rate of 8.7 gNADH&#8226;gCat&#8722;1&#8226;h&#8722;1, with stable performance over four cycles.








Abstract
The photocatalytic regeneration of NADH represents an effective means of mimicking photosynthesis, but confronts the challenges of the charge separation, electron transfer, and the selectivity control in the surface reduction stage. Herein, we report a multifunctional composite material that embeds &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked nano TPTTA covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and electron mediator (rhodium complex, [Cp*Rh(bpy) (H2O)Cl2] into a functional mesoporous silica matrix for photocatalytic NADH regeneration. This strategy enables the facilitation of the electron transfer process while maintaining the intrinsic properties of the COFs, providing flexibility in COFs design. The strategic integration of electron mediator and the shortened charge migration path due to the nanosized COFs results in an NADH regeneration yield of 75.7% and a selectivity of 89.8% for 1,4&#8208;NADH. The initial reaction rate for NADH regeneration attained 8.7 gNADH&#8226;gCat&#8722;1&#8226;h&#8722;1, and the system showed no decrease in activity after four reaction cycles.

         <title>A Flexible, Perfluorinated Analog of Aluminum Fumarate Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 35, June 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel flexible perfluorinated Al&#8208;MOF is discovered, highlighting the impact of linker fluorination on structural flexibility and sorption&#160;properties.








Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of Al&#8208;TFS, a novel aluminum metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) based on tetrafluorosuccinic acid (H2TFS), of formula Al(OH)(TFS)&#183;1.5H2O, introducing a new member to the family of perfluorinated MOFs. The structure of the MOF, solved ab&#8208;initio from laboratory powder X&#8208;ray diffraction data, displays analogies with that of the commercially available Al&#8208;fumarate (Basolite A520).

&lt;p&gt;A novel flexible perfluorinated Al-MOF is discovered, highlighting the impact of linker fluorination on structural flexibility and sorption&#160;properties.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we report the synthesis of Al-TFS, a novel aluminum metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) based on tetrafluorosuccinic acid (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TFS), of formula Al(OH)(TFS)&#183;1.5H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, introducing a new member to the family of perfluorinated MOFs. The structure of the MOF, solved &lt;i&gt;ab-initio&lt;/i&gt; from laboratory powder X-ray diffraction data, displays analogies with that of the commercially available Al-fumarate (Basolite A520). The structure is composed of 1D infinite OH-bridged AlO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; octahedra chains connected by the dicarboxylic linkers, designing rhombic channels decorated by fluorine atoms. Upon water removal, the MOF undergoes a phase transition leading to a moderate expansion of the unit cell. Volumetric analysis revealed the presence of &lt;i&gt;ultra-&lt;/i&gt;micropores with a size lower than 4 &#197;. Gas sorption measurements demonstrated for Al-TFS a slightly higher CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity compared to N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; than the Al-fumarate analog, with peculiar shapes of the isotherms suggesting a dynamic response of the framework to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption. Using different complementary techniques (in situ infrared spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, gas/vapor sorption), and density functional theory simulations, the flexibility of the new MOF was disclosed, highlighting the significant impact of fluorination in tailoring materials with structural flexibility and peculiar adsorption properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Ethylene Methoxycarbonylation Using Bidentate Phosphines: How the Stereochemistry of the Ligand Affects the Catalyst's Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 35, June 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Within the first 50 minutes in Pd&#8208;catalyzed ethylene methoxycarbonylation, racemic pytbpx (B) outperformed meso pytbpx (B) by hindering CO coordination on the Pd&#9472;H complex producing a higher yield (99 vs. 8%), highlighting the enhanced diastereomeric effect, while dtbpx (A) exhibited the highest methanolysis energy barrier and the lowest activity (2%), emphasizing the significant built&#8208;in base effect in pytbpx (B).








Abstract
To elucidate the diastereomeric control of bidentate P&#8208;ligands in the ethylene methoxycarbonylation, a comparative and systematic experimental and computational investigation was conducted on the catalytic activity of the Pd&#8208;complexes of the racemic, meso, and epimerized LIKATphos ligands (pytbpx, B) as well as the Lucite ligand (dtbpx, A). The experimental study revealed that the racemic ligand (pytbpx, B) exhibited the highest catalytic activity, while the Lucite ligand (dtbpx, A) exhibited the lowest activity, and the meso ligand (pytbpx, B) exhibited moderate activity. This activity order follows the same trend as the CO coordination energy to the palladium hydride complex for B, while the methanolysis is the rate&#8208;limiting step with A. The enhanced catalytic activity exhibited by the chiral pytbpx (B) is attributed to the higher stability of the hydride complex and lower stability of the CO complex compared to the meso pytbpx (B). The higher activity of the Pd&#8208;complexes of pytbpx (B) over the Pd&#8208;complexes of dtbpx (A) is attributed to the built&#8208;in base effect.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed C&#9472;H Oxidation of Alkanes and Postfunctionalization of Polyolefin Elastomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 35, June 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The functionalization of polyolefin elastomer (POE) was achieved through the activation of C&#9472;H bonds in the polymer backbone using a cobalt catalyst and cumene hydroperoxide as an oxidant. This transformation enabled the introduction of polar functional groups, including alcohol, ketone, and ester moieties, into the POE structure.








Abstract
This study focuses on the postfunctionalization of polyolefin elastomers (POEs) through direct C&#9472;H activation using a novel cobalt&#8208;based catalytic system. The investigation, initiated with the oxidation of cyclohexane, identified the cumene hydroperoxide (CumHPO) as the optimal oxidant and ligands L3, L4, and L7 as effective in chlorinated benzene solvents. Cobalt catalyst (Cat. 1) demonstrated superior activity in the oxidation of octadecane, achieving a 42% yield with a minimal amount of catalyst. The catalytic system was successfully extended to the C&#9472;H oxidation of POE, introducing functional groups in solvents like 1,2&#8208;Cl2C6H4 and 1,2,4&#8208;Cl3C6H3. Our findings propose a simple and green approach for the postfunctionalization of POE, offering versatility and potential for broader applications in the field of polymeric compounds.

         <title>Push and Pull: the Impact of Amino and Nitro Substituents on Heteroleptic Cu(I) Photosensitizers</title>

Giving or stealing: Four new heteroleptic Cu(I) complexes containing a nitro or amino group at the 5&#8208;position of the phenanthroline backbone were prepared and systematically studied. The different mesomeric and inductive effects of these substituents have a strong influence on the electrochemical and excited&#8208;state behavior as well as on the photocatalytic activity.








Abstract
This study presents the synthesis and characterization of four novel heteroleptic Cu(I) complexes incorporating nitro&#8208; and amino&#8208;substituted phenanthroline ligands. Their molecular structures, featuring a substituent at the 5&#8208;position of the phenanthroline backbone, were elucidated by X&#8208;ray crystallography and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Spectroscopic and electrochemical investigations revealed distinct mesomeric (M) and inductive (I) effects of the NO&#8322; and NH&#8322; substituents on the photophysical and electronic properties. The electron&#8208;withdrawing NO&#8322; group (&#8208;M, &#8208;I) stabilizes the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), shifts the reduction potential by&#160;+0.9&#160;V and completely quenches emission via nonradiative processes. In contrast, the electron&#8208;donating NH&#8322; group (+M, &#8208;I) induces a moderate redshift (&#8776; 25&#160;nm) in absorption and leads to long&#8208;lived, nonemissive excited states, particularly in CunNH&#8322; (29.1 &#181;s). Photocatalytic tests revealed no hydrogen evolution, but NH&#8322;&#8208;substituted complexes efficiently generated singlet oxygen (&#185;O&#8322;) with quantum yields of up to 39.8%. These findings demonstrate how small structural modifications can fundamentally alter the photophysics and catalytic behavior of Cu(I) complexes, providing valuable design principles for next&#8208;generation photosensitizers (PSs).

In contrast, the electron-donating NH&#8322; group (+M, -I) induces a moderate redshift (&#8776; 25&#160;nm) in absorption and leads to long-lived, nonemissive excited states, particularly in CunNH&#8322; (29.1 &#181;s).

         <title>Novel Reducibility&#8208;Tunable Carbon Dots for Efficient Radicals Scavenging and Material&#8208;Controlled Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 35, June 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The non&#8208;toxic carbon dots with excellent reducibility (r&#8208;CDs) synthesized by simple pyrolysis method exhibit effective activity for multi&#8208;radicals scavenging and have been successfully applied to fruit preservation. Interestingly, the reducibility of r&#8208;CDs can be easily regulated by N&#8208;doping, which can be used as new reductants to control the synthesis of Au NMs with different morphologies and sizes.








Abstract
The development of efficient, nontoxic, and low&#8208;cost nano&#8208;antioxidants has attracted extensive attention in food preservation but still remains a great challenge in materials design and mechanism exploration. Herein, novel reductive carbon dots (r&#8208;CDs) were successfully synthesized via a simple pyrolysis technique using sucrose as the precursor. The experimental results show that r&#8208;CDs possess excellent reducibility, and can effectively scavenge a variety of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS). So, the r&#8208;CDs exhibit remarkable preservation effects on apples and strawberries and significantly extend their shelf&#8208;life. Mechanistic studies reveal that their outstanding reducibility/antioxidant property is attributed to the formed carbon&#8208;core and numerous hydroxyl groups in the pyrolysis process. More interestingly, the reducibility of r&#8208;CDs can be gradually regulated by nitrogen doping, the obtained N&#8208;doped CDs (N&#8208;CDs) can be used to synthesize gold nanomaterial with different morphology and size, proving its potential applications in material&#8208;controlled synthesis. This study provides a new idea for the development of non&#8208;toxic, efficient carbon nano&#8208;antioxidants with tunable reducibility for food preservation and material&#8208;controlled synthesis.

&lt;p&gt;The non-toxic carbon dots with excellent reducibility (r-CDs) synthesized by simple pyrolysis method exhibit effective activity for multi-radicals scavenging and have been successfully applied to fruit preservation. Interestingly, the reducibility of r-CDs can be easily regulated by N-doping, which can be used as new reductants to control the synthesis of Au NMs with different morphologies and sizes.

         <title>Pulsed Strategy Steers the Structural Evolution of Cu Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for CO2 Reduction to Methane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 35, June 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pulsed electrolysis enables the controlled reconstruction of Cu&#8208;DMTZ MOF into Cu2O/CuO active sites, which achieves an exceptional Faradaic efficiency of 82.9% for methane production from CO2 electroreduction, markedly outperforming that in potentiostatic electrolysis mode.








Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to produce hydrocarbon fuels, such as methane (CH4), offers a promising pathway to address the dual challenges of climate change and energy shortage. Although copper&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Cu&#8208;MOFs) have proven to be promising CO2RR catalysts for hydrocarbon production, their uncontrollable structural reconstruction under operating conditions leads to elusive active sites. Herein, we demonstrate that a pulsed potential electrolysis strategy with well&#8208;designed pulse parameters can steer the dynamic reconstruction of Cu&#8208;MOFs to customize the active sites to enable the CH4 formation pathway. Mechanistic studies using electron microscopic and spectroscopic methods indicated that constant&#8208;potential electrolysis caused the rapid reduction of Cu&#8208;MOF to metallic Cu nanoparticles, whereas pulsed electrolysis enabled the controlled generation of active Cu2O/CuO nanoclusters. Benefiting from this, the pulsed system delivers an exceptional Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 82.9% in CH4 production from the CO2RR. This selectivity markedly surpasses that of the constant&#8208;potential counterpart, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. In addition, this approach facilitates stable CH4 production for over 12&#160;hours while maintaining an FE above 60%.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Organelle&#8208;Targeted Fluorescent Probe for Lipid Droplets and Endoplasmic Reticulum Using Bay&#8208;Region Substituted Perylene Diimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 35, June 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual&#8208;organelle&#8208;targeted PDI&#8208;based probe, LD&#8208;ER&#8208;PDI, has a 2&#8208;azetidinone substituent in the bay region and two different targeting groups at the opposite ends of the imide positions for LDs and ER, enabling the discrimination between LDs and ER. Moreover, it can effectively visualize the dynamic behaviors of LDs and ER under starvation and oleic acid&#8208;treated conditions, and also allows real&#8208;time monitoring of LDs formation from the ER.








Abstract
In the complex cellular microenvironment, lipid droplets (LDs) and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Their interactions are crucial for regulating processes such as lipid metabolism. Nevertheless, simultaneously monitoring these two organelles remains a challenging task. In this study, a dual&#8208;organelle&#8208;targeted perylene diimides (PDIs) based probe, LD&#8208;ER&#8208;PDI, by incorporating a 2&#8208;azetidinone substituent in the bay&#8208;region and two distinct targeting groups for LDs and ER at opposite ends of the imide positions was developed, enabling discrimination between LDs and ER. Moreover, it can effectively visualize the dynamic behaviors of LDs and ER under starvation and oleic acid&#8208;treated conditions, and also allows real&#8208;time monitoring of LDs formation from the ER. This work not only provides a valuable tool for studying the dynamic interactions between LDs and ER but also highlights a strategy for designing dual&#8208;organelle&#8208;targeted fluorescent probes.

         <title>Quercetin&#8226;Zirconium Metal Complexes: Insights from Femto to Millisecond Photobehavior</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 35, June 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The switching off of excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT), followed by the switching on of ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) processes in quercetin (QRT)&#8226;Zr complexes, is crucial for generating Zr&#8208;bound QRT radicals that exhibit significantly shorter lifetimes compared to free QRT radicals. The results indicate a faster regeneration of QRT&#8226;Zr complexes through back electron transfer (BET), which could modulate their antioxidant activities.








Abstract
Metal complexation modulates the antioxidant properties of many flavonoids, including quercetin (QRT). However, competition between the antioxidant and autoxidation processes limits their longevity. This necessitates a deeper understanding of the fate of QRT phenoxy radicals following antioxidant activity. Here, we report on the formation of QRT&#8226;Zr complexes and their photobehaviors, which account for the photochemical reactivity of the generated radicals. In methanol, N, N&#8208;dimethylformamide, and water, the UV&#8208;visible absorption spectra of the 1:1 and 1:2 complexes exhibit a significant bathochromic shift (50&#8211;100&#160;nm) and high global binding constants (1 &#8211; 14&#160;&#215; 109 M&#8722;2). While the formation of charge&#8208;transfer states through ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer in the ground state prevents the excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer that typically occurs in QRT, it leads to the generation of excited metal&#8208;bound ligand radicals. We present details on the dynamics and further relaxation from femto to millisecond regimes of the excited complexes and generated species. The lifetimes of the formed radicals are considerably shorter than those of the free QRT radicals due to rapid back electron transfer, regenerating the neutral complexes. These findings will facilitate the design of other systems for antioxidant activity, photocatalysis, and various applications in chemistry, biochemistry, and biomedicine.

A readily available isatin molecule serves as amine protecting group, reagent for reactivity Umpolung, and as chiroptical yield and enantioselectivity reporter to enable chromatography&#8208;free high&#8208;throughput optimization of an organocatalytic asymmetric Michael addition solely based on the analysis of UV and circular dichroism inductions that are obtained directly from the reaction mixtures and without time&#8208;consuming sample preparation or work&#8208;up.








Abstract
High&#8208;throughput asymmetric reaction development of an organocatalytic Michael addition is achieved by using a readily available isatin molecule as an amine protecting group, reagent for reactivity Umpolung, and as a chiroptical yield and enantioselectivity reporter. The use of UV and circular dichroism inductions allows on&#8208;the&#8208;fly, chromatography&#8208;free parallel screening of a hundred reaction conditions to identify a catalytic procedure that converts a primary amine to either enantiomer of an a&#8208;branched chiral product in excellent yields and ee&#8217;s. The isatin is recyclable and can be quantitatively recovered if desired. This case study shows how chiroptical high&#8208;throughput screening with a multitasking reagent can increase method development speed and reduce cost and waste compared to traditional reaction optimization workflows by streamlining the analysis of small&#8208;scale reaction setups and eliminating time&#8208;consuming work&#8208;up protocols.

This case study shows how chiroptical high-throughput screening with a multitasking reagent can increase method development speed and reduce cost and waste compared to traditional reaction optimization workflows by streamlining the analysis of small-scale reaction setups and eliminating time-consuming work-up protocols.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering of the Thiamine Diphosphate&#8208;Dependent JanthE for the Synthesis of Tertiary Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 35, June 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of chiral tertiary alcohols is in high demand. Here we investigate in detail the aldehyde&#8211;ketone cross&#8208;coupling reactions catalyzed by the promising thiamine diphosphate&#8208;dependent lyase JanthE. Focusing on both reaction parameters and engineering, we rationally develop JanthE to improve its applicability and demonstrate its evolvability and versatility for the enantioselective synthesis of sterically hindered tertiary alcohols.








Abstract
The development of (bio)catalytic methods to chiral tertiary alcohols is in demand, yet the enantioselective synthesis of tertiary alcohols with sterically hindered moieties is problematic. JanthE is a novel thiamine diphosphate&#8208;dependent enzyme that catalyzes aldehyde&#8208;ketone cross&#8208;coupling reactions with a wide range of donor and acceptor substrates. However, product formation is low and precludes large&#8208;scale production. We investigated the conversion of 2&#8208;oxobutanoate and the bulky ketone phenoxy&#8208;2&#8208;propanone to the product 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;methyl&#8208;1&#8208;phenoxypentan&#8208;3&#8208;one as a model reaction for the synthetic capabilities of JanthE. As the reaction design did not significantly improve the yield, we proceeded to rational protein engineering. Docking experiments identified V121, Y268, P293, Y297, and K567 in the active site as important residues for catalysis. Remarkably, the single&#8208;point variant JanthE K567S led to a fivefold increase in product formation (90% ee) compared to the wild type enzyme (93% ee). The reaction was performed at preparative scale proving the direct possibility of application. Additionally, when the reaction was extended to longer 2&#8208;oxopentanoate, the double variant Y297P_K567S showed a 5&#8208;fold increase in product formation compared to the wild type. Our results demonstrate the evolvability and versatility of JanthE for the enantioselective synthesis of sterically hindered tertiary alcohols.

         <title>Enhanced Near&#8208;infrared Circularly Polarized Luminescence Activity in Fluorinated Binolate Ytterbium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 35, June 23, 2025. </description>

A pair of novel CPL&#8208;active Shibasaki&#8208;type Yb(III) enantiomers supported by 3,3&#8242;&#8208;fluorinated binaphthol (F2BINOL) was designed and optically investigated, showing enhanced photophysical properties and CPL metrics compared to the nonfluorinated counterparts.








Abstract
Chiral lanthanide complexes hold great potential in developing advanced circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) wavelength range. While various ligands, such as &#946;&#8208;diketonates and biphenols, have been successfully used to sensitize NIR emission of lanthanide ions, little attention has been paid to regulating CPL behaviors via ligand modification. In this study, we report the synthesis, structure, luminescence, and chiroptical properties of a pair of novel air&#8208;stable Shibasaki&#8208;type Yb(III) enantiomers supported by 3,3&#8242;&#8208;fluorinated binaphthol (F2BINOL). Compared to their nonfluorinated counterparts, these fluorinated complexes exhibit larger dihedral angles between the two naphthyl moieties and more distorted octahedral coordination environments around the Yb(III) ion, leading to increased overall crystal field splitting. These structural modifications result in enhanced photophysical properties: the luminescence lifetime (&#964;obs), sensitization efficiency (&#951;sens), and quantum yield (QY) improve from 2.1 &#181;s, 38%, and 0.7% to 2.7 &#181;s, 63%, and 1.8%, respectively. Additionally, the dissymmetry factor (glum) and CPL brightness (BCPL) at 963&#160;nm increase by 32% and one order of magnitude, respectively. The scope of such chemical modification is broad, potentially encompassing a variety of BINOL derivatives, offering a unique platform to further elucidate the relationship between structural and electronic properties and CPL activity in lanthanide systems.

         <title>Efficient Singlet Oxygen Monitoring in Aqueous Media Comprising a Polymer&#8208;embedded Eu3+&#8208;Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 35, June 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A singlet dioxygen (1O2) sensitive Eu(III) complex embedded in polymer nanoparticles efficiently detects 1O2 in aqueous media by a remarkable increase in Eu3+ luminescence. These particles also adhere to bacteria surfaces, where the cells appear brightly stained in the presence of 1O2 enabling spectroscopic evaluation and easy detection under the microscope.








Abstract
Singlet dioxygen (1O2) plays a pivotal role as the active agent in photodynamic therapy (PDT) for cancer treatment, as well as in the photo&#8208;inactivation of antibiotic&#8208;resistant microbes (antimicrobial photodynamic therapy, aPDT). The ability to sensitively monitor the production and behavior of &#185;O&#8322; following its photo&#8208;catalytic generation is crucial for developing effective therapeutic strategies. Optical sensor molecules that respond to &#185;O&#8322; through changes in absorption or, more sensitively, fluorescence, are suitable choices. While most monitors report 1O2 via altered absorption spectra, only few compounds respond by the onset of fluorescence, even fewer based on lanthanide luminescence. By embedding a novel lanthanide complex (Eu3+) into polystyrene nanoparticles (beads), we achieved close to a 500&#8208;fold emission intensity boost in the presence of 1O2, very long decay times of up to 879 &#181;s and unprecedented stability in acidic and basic media. Furthermore, the beads present a high&#8208;surface charge (&gt;+30&#160;mV), yielding stable aqueous dispersions, which we exploited in a preliminary &#8220;proof of principle&#8221; staining experiment of (negatively charged) bacterial surfaces. The straightforward synthesis circumvents intricate preparative steps and restrictive costs. The decay characteristics furthermore pave the road to time&#8208;gated measurements, that is, to the suppression of interfering autofluorescence from biological samples.

         <title>Efficient Deep&#8208;Blue TADF Emission from Multiheteroatom&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Embedded with Dual B&#9472;O Covalent Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 35, June 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel TADF emitter with a multiheteroatom PAH skeleton featuring dual B&#9472;O covalent bonds instead of isolated boron atoms was reported. BNB&#8208;OPTZ was synthesized via a one&#8208;pot, demethylation&#8208;directed, lithium&#8208;free method in over 80% yield. The emitter exhibits deep blue emission at 441&#160;nm in toluene, with CIE coordinates of (0.14, 0.05). OLEDs based on BNB&#8208;OPTZ achieved a maximum EQE of 23.1%, demonstrating the potential of B&#9472;O covalent bonds&#8208;embedded PAHs for high&#8208;performance blue OLEDs.








Abstract
Boron&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have demonstrated exceptional potential in the development of high&#8208;performance organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). In this study, we propose a novel strategy for constructing PAH structures with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties by incorporating boron&#8208;oxygen (B&#9472;O) covalent bonds, as opposed to doping isolated boron atoms. The newly designed multiheteroatom&#8208;doped molecule, BNB&#8208;OPTZ, was synthesized via a demethylation&#8208;directed, lithium&#8208;free methodology, achieving an impressive one&#8208;pot yield exceeding 80%. BNB&#8208;OPTZ adopts a symmetric, distorted semi&#8208;planar rigid conformation. Theoretical calculations reveal its long&#8208;range charge transfer characteristics. The molecule exhibits deep blue emission with a peak wavelength of 441&#160;nm in toluene solution, accompanied by CIE coordinates of (0.14, 0.05). Notably, the blue OLED device using BNB&#8208;OPTZ achieved a remarkable external quantum efficiency of 23.1%. These findings suggest that the incorporation of B&#9472;O covalent bonds into multiheteroatom&#8208;doped PAH frameworks offers a promising design strategy for advancing PAH&#8208;based blue&#8208;light OLED applications.

In this study, we propose a novel strategy for constructing PAH structures with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties by incorporating boron-oxygen (B&#9472;O) covalent bonds, as opposed to doping isolated boron atoms. The newly designed multiheteroatom-doped molecule, BNB-OPTZ, was synthesized via a demethylation-directed, lithium-free methodology, achieving an impressive one-pot yield exceeding 80%. BNB-OPTZ adopts a symmetric, distorted semi-planar rigid conformation. Theoretical calculations reveal its long-range charge transfer characteristics. The molecule exhibits deep blue emission with a peak wavelength of 441&#160;nm in toluene solution, accompanied by CIE coordinates of (0.14, 0.05). Notably, the blue OLED device using BNB-OPTZ achieved a remarkable external quantum efficiency of 23.1%. These findings suggest that the incorporation of B&#9472;O covalent bonds into multiheteroatom-doped PAH frameworks offers a promising design strategy for advancing PAH-based blue-light OLED applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Arylboronic Acid Catalyzed Reductive Alkylation of Azoarenes to N&#8208;Alkylated Hydrazines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 35, June 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Arylboronic acid&#8208;catalyzed reductive alkylation of azoarene to N&#8208;alkylated hydrazine is reported. The mild reaction conditions suppress N&#8211;N cleaved products and selectively provide trisubstituted hydrazine derivatives. The study suggests the mode of boronic catalysis involves both Br&#248;nsted acid and H&#8208;bond donor catalysis.








Abstract
Hydrazine derivatives are generally difficult to prepare despite their appealing structural simplicity. The synthetic challenge may arise from either the similar reactivity or the relatively low activity of the two nitrogen atoms in a hydrazine precursor. The former would lead to severe selectivity issues while the latter would require harsh reaction conditions. Herein we report a facile method for the synthesis of N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;N, N&#8242;&#8208;diarylhydrazines by boronic acid&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot tandem reduction of azoarene to hydrazoarene followed by reductive alkylation with the aldehyde. The mild reaction conditions suppress N&#8211;N cleaved products and selectively provide trisubstituted hydrazine derivatives. The reaction is highly chemoselective and tolerates various hydrogenation&#8208;sensitive functional groups. The method has been successfully utilized in the late&#8208;stage functionalization and diversification of pharmaceuticals. A series of control experiments with boronic acids, boronic ester, and Br&#248;nsted acids were interpreted. The study suggests the mode of boronic catalysis involves both Br&#248;nsted acid and H&#8208;bond donor catalysis. Based on the thermodynamic activation parameters, kinetic Hammett studies, and competitive reaction on the substrate, it has been postulated that the iminium formation step is likely to be the rate&#8208;limiting step.

         <title>Organic Cage Rotaxanes</title>

The synthesis of robust, amine&#8208;based organic cages with a controllable number of alkyne functional groups is described. Subsequent post&#8208;synthetic modification enabled installation of a defined number of rotaxane units on the external surfaces, resulting in changes to the physiochemical properties of the cages.








Abstract
Organic cages are a robust class of molecular hosts with a myriad of applications in materials science. Despite this, there has been a paucity of explorations into the modification of their properties via external functionalization. In this work, [n]rotaxanes featuring unoccupied organic cages as stopper components and a small 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine macrocycle were constructed using the active metal template (AMT) approach. By exploiting a scrambling methodology, it was possible to synthesize cages with a defined number of interlocked components (n = 2&#8211;4). The gas uptake, solubility, and thermal properties of the interlocked systems were compared against those of their constituent, non&#8208;interlocked components. In this manner, we were able to demonstrate the potential of exploiting the mechanical bond for modulating the physiochemical properties of these molecular materials.

A radical cyclization reaction of 1,6&#8208;enynes using Cu(I) as the catalyst and 4&#8208;methylbenzoic acid as the cocatalyst has been used to access 1&#8208;Indanone derivatives. There are some advantages to the reaction such as available materials, simple operation, and compatibility with a wide range of substituents. Notably, in the absence of 4&#8208;methylbenzoic acid, the reaction undergoes a dramatic shift in product selectivity, yielding 1H&#8209;cyclopropa[b] naphthalene&#8208;2,7&#8208;diones exclusively under the same conditions, with Cu(I) acting as the sole catalyst.








Abstract
1&#8208;Indanone derivatives are efficiently synthesized via a radical cyclization reaction of 1,6&#8208;enynes, using TBHP as both oxidant and reactant, in the presence of Cu(I) as the catalyst and 4&#8208;methyl benzoic acid as the cocatalyst. Notably, in the absence of 4&#8208;methyl benzoic acid, the reaction undergoes a dramatic shift in product selectivity, yielding 1H&#8209;cyclopropa[b]naphthalene&#8208;2,7&#8208;diones exclusively under the same conditions, with Cu(I) acting as the sole catalyst. This transformation offers key advantages, including operational simplicity, cost&#8208;effective and readily available materials, scalability to gram quantities, and compatibility with a wide range of functional groups. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations confirmed that the reaction proceeds through a radical pathway, highlighting the pivotal role of 4&#8208;methylbenzoic acid as the cocatalyst in altering product selectivity.

Novel CT assemblies consisted of a concaved aromatic host and electron&#8208;deficient organic salts are reported. The CT transition is promoted by concerted weak interactions between the components. The excited state dynamics are revealed by a theoretical study and a time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy.








Abstract
Supramolecular assemblies of a concaved aromatic host as an electron donor (D) and a cationic heterocyclic guest as an electron acceptor (A) are reported. These molecular units were noncovalently bound to afford charge&#8208;transfer (CT) complexes in solution and a CT cocrystal, displaying drastic color change from colorless to orange. The binding motif of the assemblies in the solution state was analyzed by NMR spectroscopic analysis and visualized by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Theoretical calculations for the assemblies revealed electronic communication between the D and A fragments, proving their CT characteristics. The CT complexes were stabilized by not only CT and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions, but also Coulomb interaction between the cationic acceptor unit and its anion supported by a hydrogen bond with a hydroxy group in the aromatic host, resulted in enhancement of orbital overlapping of the D&#8208;A fragments. Owing to the strong D&#8208;A interaction in the assemblies, the CT complexes undergo ultrafast charge recombination on a femtosecond timescale after photoexcitation of the CT transition, as confirmed by transient absorption spectroscopy. These results demonstrate that understanding of assembly motif and its noncovalent interactions can lead to create optical materials manipulating electron transition dynamics.

This article describes the synthesis, along with the full photophysical and computational characterization, of a series of push&#8208;pull boron complexes comprising a sterically hindered donor connected to a pyrimidine&#8208;based O^N^O boron chelate. Incorporation of the dimethylacridan derivative into an organic light&#8208;emitting diode led to the observation of intense electroluminescence, with EQEmax values reaching 9.7% at a 5 wt% doping concentration.








Abstract
This article describes the synthesis, along with the full photophysical and computational characterization, of a series of push&#8208;pull boron complexes comprising a sterically hindered donor connected to a pyrimidine&#8208;based O^N^O boron chelate. The dimethylacridan&#8208;functionalized fluorophore appears to be the most emissive in the series, both in toluene solution and in the solid state (as a powder), displaying thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emission in degassed media due to a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap. This result is in line with a previously reported pyridine analogue, which also exhibits delayed emission. Incorporation of this TADF compound into an organic light&#8208;emitting diode led to the observation of intense electroluminescence, with EQEmax values reaching 9.7% at a 5 wt% doping concentration.

         <title>Rational Design of a Deep&#8208;Red Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission&#8208;Active Iridium Complex for Plant Cell Wall Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 35, June 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aggregation&#8208;induced emission&#8208;active, deep&#8208;red emissive iridium complex (Ir&#8208;CW) is designed to specifically stain plant cell walls. Ir&#8208;CW shows selective binding to pectin through electrostatic interactions between pyridinyl groups and carboxylic groups and lights up plant cell walls in high resolution, significantly expanding the use of iridium complexes as powerful tools for botanical studies.








Abstract
Plant cell wall imaging has received consistent attention in characterizing and monitoring the structure and health of plant tissues. To overcome current drawbacks of plant cell wall staining, such as source limitations, low specificity, and auto&#8208;fluorescence interference, in this work, we present the rational design of an aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active, deep&#8208;red emissive iridium complex as a specific staining agent of plant cell walls. Cell wall probe [Ir(dpyb)2(iqbtz)]+ (Ir&#8208;CW), bearing two rotatable pyridyl moieties, is designed for selective binding to pectin, one of the major components of the cell wall that carries rich carboxylic residues on its polymer chain. The AIE properties, pectin sensing behaviors, pectin binding mechanism, and practical application of cell wall staining of Ir&#8208;CW are performed. Results demonstrate that Ir&#8208;CW exhibits pectin&#8208;responsive AIE properties and selective pectin binding against common interfering species, including metal ions, anions, amino acids, proteins, and saccharides. Notably, Ir&#8208;CW can specifically stain plant cell walls with better performance than Congo red, a commercial cell wall staining agent. This work highlights the rationales of developing novel iridium complexes for cell wall staining and widely broadening their applications as powerful tools for botanical studies.

         <title>Matrix Isolation and Solvation of the Benzonitrile Radical Anion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 35, June 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrated electrons are potent reducing agents that may play significant roles in chemical evolution within astrochemical and prebiotic environments. Benzonitrile, a molecule present in the interstellar medium (ISM), can capture electrons in amorphous water ice at cryogenic temperatures, forming a radical anion. This radical anion engages in hydrogen bonding with surrounding water molecules, interactions that can be characterized using infrared (IR) spectroscopy.








Abstract
Solvated electrons, one of the strongest reducing agents, exhibit short lifetimes in the range of pico&#8208; to milliseconds when generated photochemically or by radiolysis in solution. In contrast, solvated electrons produced using sodium metal in liquid ammonia are stable for days and have long been used in synthetic chemistry. Using sodium atoms as an electron source, we were able to trap solvated electrons in low&#8208;density amorphous (LDA) water ice matrices with lifetimes of several days and use these electrons as reducing reagents. In LDA matrices doped with benzonitrile 1, these electrons react with 1 to form the benzonitrile radical anion 2. In argon matrices, in the absence of water, only small amounts of 2 were observed after deposition, and most of the sodium and 1 remained unreacted. The yield of radical anion 2 is significantly higher in amorphous water ice than in solid argon. The photoexcitation of radical anion 2 in both argon and LDA water ice matrices resulted in a reversal of the electron transfer under back formation of benzonitrile 1. Annealing of argon matrices doped with small amounts of water containing 2 resulted in the formation of 1:1 and 2:1 hydrogen&#8208;bonded complexes between water and radical anion 2.

         <title>Photocatalyzed Dicyanation of Alkenes Enabled by Phosphorus Radical Cation Addition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 35, June 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a synergistic phosphine&#8208;photoredox catalytic strategy for the direct dicyanation of styrenes with TMSCN. This approach utilizes a phosphorus radical cation to initiate an oxidative radical&#8208;polar crossover with alkenes, followed by sequential nucleophilic cyanation, enabling the efficient synthesis of alkyl 1,2&#8208;dinitriles from alkenes. Further synthetic transformations of these dinitrile motifs and mechanistic insights into the reaction pathway have been demonstrated.








Abstract
While notable progress has been made in alkene cyanation for the synthesis of alkyl nitriles, catalytic strategies enabling the direct dicyanation of simple alkenes remain relatively under&#8208;explored. In this study, we introduce a synergistic phosphine&#8208;photoredox catalytic system that facilitates the direct dicyanation of styrenes using TMSCN in the presence of oxidant. This approach utilizes a phosphorus radical cation to initiate an oxidative radical&#8208;polar crossover with alkenes, followed by sequential nucleophilic cyanation. This protocol allows for the efficient synthesis of alkyl 1,2&#8208;dinitriles from alkenes under mild conditions. Notably, the method exhibits broad substrate scope and commendable efficiency, serving as a valuable complement to existing cyanation methodologies. The synthetic utility of the dinitrile products is further demonstrated through diverse derivatization reactions, highlighting their applicability in constructing nitrogen&#8208;rich molecular architectures. Mechanistic studies provide further insight into the reaction pathway and underscore the potential of phosphorus radical cations in alkene functionalization.

         <title>Linkage Engineering of Triazine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Selective Photocatalytic Oxidation of Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 35, June 23, 2025. </description>

TFPT&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF, with a C&#9552;C linkage, demonstrates significantly higher activities than TFPT&#8208;IM&#8208;COF, with a C&#9552;N linkage, for selective photocatalytic oxidation of amines to imines with O2, highlighting the pivotal role of linkage engineering.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have garnered significant attention as versatile photocatalysts due to their tunable structure and activity. In this work, linkage engineering is applied to two triazine&#8208;based COFs, yielding TFPT&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF, with a C&#9552;C linkage and TFPT&#8208;IM&#8208;COF, with a C&#9552;N linkage. TFPT&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF exhibits better thermal stability and a significantly higher specific surface area than TFPT&#8208;IM&#8208;COF. More importantly, the C&#9552;C linkage in TFPT&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF leads to better optoelectronic properties than the C&#9552;N linkage in TFPT&#8208;IM&#8208;COF, as it promotes efficient charge separation and transfer and &#960;&#8208;delocalization, as evidenced by experiments and density functional theory calculations. Consequently, TFPT&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF demonstrates higher activities than TFPT&#8208;IM&#8208;COF for selective photocatalytic oxidation of amines. Notably, a diverse range of amines achieve high conversions to corresponding imines with high selectivities. Superoxide, generated through photoexcited electron transfer to O2, is identified as the predominant reactive oxygen species. This work underscores the pivotal role of linkage engineering in optimizing COFs for selective reactions.

&lt;p&gt;Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have garnered significant attention as versatile photocatalysts due to their tunable structure and activity. In this work, linkage engineering is applied to two triazine-based COFs, yielding TFPT-sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;c-COF, with a C&#9552;C linkage and TFPT-IM-COF, with a C&#9552;N linkage. TFPT-sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;c-COF exhibits better thermal stability and a significantly higher specific surface area than TFPT-IM-COF. More importantly, the C&#9552;C linkage in TFPT-sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;c-COF leads to better optoelectronic properties than the C&#9552;N linkage in TFPT-IM-COF, as it promotes efficient charge separation and transfer and &#960;-delocalization, as evidenced by experiments and density functional theory calculations. Consequently, TFPT-sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;c-COF demonstrates higher activities than TFPT-IM-COF for selective photocatalytic oxidation of amines. Notably, a diverse range of amines achieve high conversions to corresponding imines with high selectivities. Superoxide, generated through photoexcited electron transfer to O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, is identified as the predominant reactive oxygen species. This work underscores the pivotal role of linkage engineering in optimizing COFs for selective reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fluorescent Deferoxamine Complexes of Cu(II) and Zr(IV): Insights in the Development of Dual Imaging Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 35, June 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The insertion of a fluorescent coumarin unit by using a lysine&#8208;based linker on deferoxamine leads to a chelating agent (DFOKC), whose Cu(II) and Zr(IV) complexes can be used for both optical imaging and positron emission tomography. DFOKC shows increased binding ability for Cu(II) and Zr(II) and improved tumor cell internalization via pinocytosis.








Abstract
Deferoxamine (DFO) is widely regarded as benchmark chelator for 89Zr(IV), a commonly used PET (positron emission tomography) tracer. We have introduced a novel fluorescent coumarin derivative of DFO (DFOKC), characterized by chelating unit and fluorophore covalently linked via a lysine molecule. This design introduces a free primary amine group, which, in perspective, can be functionalized with biological vectors, potentially improving tumor tissue selectivity. Its acid&#8208;base and metal coordination properties toward Cu(II) and Zr(IV) ions were thoroughly characterized using UV&#8208;Vis and fluorescence emission spectroscopy. DFOKC strongly coordinates both metal ions, forming somewhat more stable complexes than DFO, while retaining fluorescence emission, thus enabling dual&#8208;mode optical and PET imaging. Biodistribution assays conducted on NIH&#8208;3T3 fibroblasts, and MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 mammary adenocarcinoma cell lines demonstrated that the presence of primary amine groups favors Zr&#8208;DFOKC complex cell internalization via pinocytosis compared to the parent molecule DFOC, in which the fluorophore is linked to the amine group of DFO. Furthermore, crystal violet and MTT assays revealed no cytotoxic effects or mitochondrial impairment, even at concentrations higher than those typically used for radio&#8208;diagnostic applications. These results strongly support the potential of DFOKC as a versatile and promising tool for dual imaging, offering significant advantages in molecular imaging.

The catalytic asymmetric Michael additions of 1&#8208;pyrroline esters to &#946;&#8208;fluoroalkyl alkenyl imides and azodicarboxylates in the presence of AgOAc or CuOAc catalyst have been established.








Abstract
The asymmetric Michael addition reactions of 1&#8208;pyrroline esters with &#946;&#8208;fluoroalkyl alkenyl imides and dialkyl azodicarboxylates catalyzed by the AgOAc/Ph&#8208;phosferrox or CuOAc/(R)&#8208;BINAP complex have been developed. A series of chiral 1,5,5&#8208;trisubstituted pyrroline ester derivatives have been obtained in 53%&#8211;90% yields with 80%&#8211;99% ee&#8217;s and all&#160;&gt;&#160;20:1 dr. The gram&#8208;scale synthesis and synthetic application of the chiral trifluoromethylated 1&#8208;pyrroline adducts were exhibited: the pyrrolizidin&#8208;3&#8208;one analogue was first synthesized with 94% ee and&#160;&gt;&#160;20:1 dr through two steps of hydrolysis and reductive cyclization; the pyrrolidine and lactam derivatives were also successfully provided under the reducing conditions of NaBH3CN and Pd/C&#9472;H2, respectively.

         <title>Bifunctional Chiral ImPy&#8208;Carbene Ligands. H&#8208;Bonding Controlled Reactivity and Enantioselectivity in Au(I)&#8208;Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 35, June 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of catalytically highly efficient bifunctional imidazopyridine (ImPy)&#8208;based gold(I) complexes was synthesized. The ligands are based on tetrahedral C&#8208;stereogenic centers derived from straightforward chiral pool synthesis. Unprecedented cycloisomerization products of 1,6&#8208;enynols were observed in excellent enantioselectivity up to 99:1 er. DFT calculations were utilized for intricate mechanistic investigations.








Abstract
Bifunctional chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands have been devised for enantioselective gold(I) catalysis. Based on a single C&#8208;stereogenic center derived from chiral pool &#945;&#8208;aminoacids and connecting an imidazopyridine core to an arylurea motif, enantioselective gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization reactions could be achieved. High enantioselectivities were notably observed for substrates presenting a pendant propargyl alcohol on 2&#8208;naphthol and 1,6&#8208;enyne scaffolds. In the latter case, the catalyst shows a high degree of selectivity for the unprecedented 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig biscyclization of these substrates to give cyclopropyl&#8208;fused 6&#8208;ring heterocycles with a free OH functionality instead of the previously reported furan&#8208;fused products. This unusual selectivity was investigated by DFT studies, which suggested the dual role of the carbonyl group of the urea moiety: first as an H&#8208;bond acceptor in the catalytic cycle to direct the enantioselectivity and second as a cooperative group in the hydrogen shift leading to deauration.

         <title>Recyclable, Biobased Polycarbonates and Polyesters by Naphthoxy&#8208;Imine Zinc and Magnesium Complexes</title>

Zinc and magnesium complexes, like skilled composers, craft polymeric symphonies by orchestrating diverse combinations of monomers. Once their performance is complete, the polymers gracefully can be decomposed back into their original monomers, ready to be composed into new symphonies.








Abstract
Naphthoxy&#8208;imine pyridine zinc and magnesium complexes were synthesized and fully characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). In the presence of an alcohol as initiator, both complexes promoted the ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of L&#8208;lactide (L&#8208;LA), &#949;&#8208;caprolactone (&#949;&#8208;CL), &#946;&#8208;butyrolactone (&#946;&#8208;BL), trimethylene carbonate (TMC), and 1&#8208;methyl trimethylene carbonate (Me&#8208;TMC), which was purposely synthesized from CO2 and the appropriate diol. The zinc complex exhibited notably high activity, particularly in the polymerization of lactide and TMC, and was subsequently employed in the synthesis of polytrimethylene carbonate&#8208;based diblock and random copolymers with both &#949;&#8208;CL and L&#8208;LA. Furthermore, the zinc complex demonstrated its ability to close the life cycle of the synthesized materials by successfully depolymerizing both polytrimethylene carbonate (PTMC) and its copolymers.

         <title>Role of Symmetry to Dictate Pathway&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;assembly in Photoresponsive Peptide Amphiphiles</title>

This study investigates the role of molecular symmetry with respect to azobenzene and the effect of local microenvironment in governing the self&#8208;assembly and stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior of peptide amphiphiles, revealing distinct aggregation pathways.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive peptides offer interesting structural space in the realm of emergent pathway&#8208;driven supramolecular polymerization toward designing functional nanomaterials with precise structure&#8208;function characteristics. However, the role of molecular symmetry in such peptides to govern the self&#8208;assembly pathway dynamics remains less explored. We design amyloid&#8208;inspired, azobenzene&#8208;functionalized symmetric (P1) and asymmetric (P2) peptide amphiphiles in the E form of the azobenzene motif to systematically investigate the interplay of molecular symmetry, solvent composition, and temperature to guide supramolecular organization. Spectroscopic and microscopic analyses reveal distinct aggregation pathways, with E&#8208;P1 exhibiting rapid nucleation&#8208;elongation toward robust and stable nanofibers, while E&#8208;P2 assembles into a kinetic state (E&#8208;P2(KS)) that subsequently transforms into thermodynamically favored nanoribbons, E&#8208;P2(TS), via a &#8220;good and bad solvent&#8221; modulation strategy. Further, E&#8208;P1 remains structurally resilient due to stronger intermolecular interactions. Interestingly, E&#8208;P2 demonstrates reversible E&#8594;Z photoisomerization in both kinetic and thermodynamic states, facilitating supramolecular disassembly while retaining the self&#8208;organization memory. Notably, the activation energy barriers for Z&#8594;E isomerization in P2 differ between its kinetic and thermodynamic states, underscoring the role of pathway complexity and molecular symmetry in peptide assembly. These insights advance the understanding of symmetry&#8208;regulated supramolecular assembly to modulate the emergent functional properties for potential applications in nanotechnology and biomaterials.

Living crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly is a facile technique for the synthesis of low&#8208;length dispersity 1D and 2D nanoparticles. Oil&#8208;based systems have applications in electronics and as friction modifiers and are underreported in literature. In this work, we synthesize tunable block copolymers with a poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) (PCL) core&#8208;forming block and poly(n&#8208;methacrylate) corona block. We report on their self&#8208;assembly in n&#8208;octane for the synthesis of monodisperse nanoparticles of a controlled length and morphology.








Abstract
Crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA) has been extensively studied for the formation of bespoke nanoparticles and provides a unique way to control the unidirectional growth of block copolymers (BCPs). Currently, oil&#8208;soluble nanoparticles represent an under&#8208;researched area in the literature, stemming from the difficulty in synthesizing organic nanoparticles with higher&#8208;order morphologies using traditional techniques. These oil&#8208;soluble nanoparticles have uses as components in products as diverse as electronics and engine oils, with current research determining a strong relationship between morphology and performance, with anisotropic nanoparticles outperforming spherical counterparts. Here, we report on the facile self&#8208;assembly of polyester&#8208;based BCPs in n&#8208;octane to achieve low&#8208;dispersity 1D and 2D nanoparticles. This report focuses on using tunable, oil&#8208;soluble polymers and aims to understand their self&#8208;assembly in n&#8208;octane through the variation of self&#8208;assembly conditions and unimer solubility to form nanoparticles of a controlled and variable size.

Ditelluride exchange. Chemically and structurally diverse ditellurides undergo a rapid Te&#8208;Te exchange under mild reaction conditions in the absence of an external stimulus, indicating that ditellurides could find application in various dynamic molecular systems.








Abstract
Dynamic combinatorial chemistry enables the exploration of reversible chemical exchange reactions. Here, we report studies on the dynamic Te&#9472;Te bond exchange of chemically and structurally diverse ditellurides using 125Te NMR spectroscopy. The results revealed rapid and unbiased equilibration, forming a consistent 1:1 distribution of reactants and products across all chemical systems. Extending to multi&#8208;component mixtures, we observed robust equilibrium formation even in complex systems involving multiple ditelluride species that can be easily distinguished by 125Te NMR spectroscopy. In line with the NMR analyses showing that the Te&#9472;Te bond exchange efficiently proceeds in various solvents, at very low temperatures, in the absence of visible light, and in the presence of radical scavengers, quantum chemical analyses revealed that the ditelluride&#8208;ditelluride exchange likely proceeds via a non&#8208;synchronous concerted mechanism and not via an alternative radical mechanism. Integrated NMR spectroscopic and quantum chemical analyses also showed that the efficiency of the chalcogen&#8208;chalcogen exchange involving ditellurides follows the trend Te&#8208;Te &gt; Te&#8208;Se &gt; Te&#8208;S. Overall, the results indicate that ditellurides are excellent dynamic systems that may find applications across molecular sciences.

         <dc:description>
Heterochiral peptides are known to exhibit unique folding and self&#8208;assembly behaviors. Yet, the impact of heterochirality in peptide&#8208;based dynamic combinatorial chemistry remains largely unexplored. This study reveals that chirality effects can be used to increase diversity in dynamic combinatorial libraries, significantly enhancing the potential applications of these systems in the discovery of new drugs, biosensors, and adaptive materials.








Abstract
Naturally occurring peptides are almost exclusively composed of L&#8208;amino acids, and the incorporation of D&#8208;amino acids can profoundly alter their ability to fold and self&#8208;assemble. Here we explore the effects of chirality on the formation of disulfide dynamic combinatorial libraries (DCLs) generated by short cysteine&#8208;rich peptides. Our findings consistently show that heterochiral tripeptides form more diverse DCLs than their homochiral counterparts. The most complex library appears to encompass all possible cyclic species up to 19mers. Given that each of these species exists as a mixture of parallel and antiparallel isomers, we estimate this library to contain a total of 2,045 distinct compounds&#8212;a remarkable result considering that the library generated by the analogous homochiral peptide predominantly contains two dimers. In certain situations, peptide chirality also affects the relative stability of parallel and antiparallel isomers. Taken together, these results show that small changes in peptide chirality can be dramatically amplified through the formation of cyclic species.

         <title>Carboxyltin&#8208;Functionalized Tungstobismuthate/TiO2 Photoanodes for Enhanced Energy Storage Effect in Metal Photoelectrochemical Cathodic Protection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 35, June 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, POMs are introduced into the PECCP system. The carboxyltin functionalized Bi&#8208;POMs can tightly composite with TiO2, and the Bi&#8208;POM/TiO2 photoanodes can provide PECCP for 304 stainless steel in seawater, which is expected to be a promising photoanode for in real seawater.








Abstract
Photoelectrochemical cathodic protection (PECCP) is a novel and environment&#8208;friendly metal anti&#8208;corrosion technology, and constructing photoelectronic materials that can provide sustained protection under both illumination and dark is a key challenge. Herein, four cases of transition metal (TM) and carboxyltin&#8208;modified polyoxometalates (POMs) based on trivacant Keggin&#8208;type tungstobismuthate subunits, denoted as Bi&#8208;POMs, were designed and synthesized in aqueous solutions.

&lt;p&gt;For the first time, POMs are introduced into the PECCP system. The carboxyltin functionalized Bi-POMs can tightly composite with TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and the Bi-POM/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoanodes can provide PECCP for 304 stainless steel in seawater, which is expected to be a promising photoanode for in real seawater.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photoelectrochemical cathodic protection (PECCP) is a novel and environment-friendly metal anti-corrosion technology, and constructing photoelectronic materials that can provide sustained protection under both illumination and dark is a key challenge. Herein, four cases of transition metal (TM) and carboxyltin-modified polyoxometalates (POMs) based on trivacant Keggin-type tungstobismuthate subunits, denoted as Bi-POMs, were designed and synthesized in aqueous solutions. The introduced carboxyl groups can anchor TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and the export of electrons from POM clusters occurred, making these POM-based materials useable in the PECCP field for the first time. Under illumination, the Bi-POM/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoanodes were capable of cathodically polarizing 304 stainless steel (304SS) by 440&#8211;465&#160;mV. In darkness, their coupled potentials of &#8722;197 to &#8722;175&#160;mV were significantly lower than that of TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&#8722;97&#160;mV), indicating the obviously enhanced dark cathodic protection effect. Precisely, the interdependence between Bi, POM, and TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ensures Bi-POMs to protect 304SS in seawater and provide stable and sustainable cathodic protection under intermittent light.

         <title>Sulfate Recognition in Water via Charge&#8208;Assisted Hydrogen Bonding</title>

         <dc:description>
A dicationic tetralactam macrocycle achieves selective sulfate recognition in water via charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonding. Structural, thermodynamic, and computational studies reveal an entropy&#8208;driven mechanism enabled by electrostatic complementarity and desolvation. This work offers design principles for developing aqueous&#8208;phase receptors for sensing, separation, and catalysis.








Abstract
Achieving selective molecular recognition of hydrophilic anions in water remains a formidable challenge due to the competitive nature of water and the high hydration energies of target anions such as sulfate. Here, we report the design, synthesis, and characterization of a simple dicationic tetralactam macrocycle (BPTL2&#8314;&#183;2Cl&#8315;) capable of binding highly hydrated anions in water via charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonding. Structural, spectroscopic, thermodynamic, and computational studies reveal that BPTL2&#8314; exhibits a strong binding affinity for sulfate (Ka&#160;=&#160;2892&#160;M&#8315;&#185;), driven primarily by entropic gain from water release and reinforced by electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and DFT&#8208;optimized structures confirm the formation of directional [N&#9472;H&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;O] and [C&#9472;H&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;O] hydrogen bonds. Comparative studies with a control macrocycle (6Na+&#8226;HCTL6&#8722;) that has a charge&#8208;neutral binding cavity underscore the essential role of cationic charge in overcoming desolvation enthalpic penalties. The receptor displays anti&#8208;Hofmeister selectivity, preferentially binding more hydrophilic anions. This work provides fundamental insights into the mechanisms of anion recognition in water. It establishes charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonding as a powerful strategy for developing next&#8208;generation receptors for sensing, separation, sequestration, transport, and catalysis in aqueous environments.

         <title>A Convergent Approach to Resorcinolic Macrolides to Expand Structural Diversity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 35, June 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular and enantioselective approach to resorcinolic macrolides enables targeted C15 modifications, macrocycle rigidity, and a novel cyclic peptide hybrid strategy to tune ATP&#8208;binding site selectivity. Structural alterations enhance Hsp90 paralog inhibition, introduce covalent warheads for GRP94, and reveal new inhibitors of KRasG12C, expanding ATP&#8208;mimetic chemical space for drug discovery.








Abstract
The resorcinolic macrolide (RM) family comprises over 50 natural products with diverse biological activities, including the potent natural Hsp90 inhibitor radicicol. Here, we report a modular and enantioselective synthetic strategy featuring a biomimetic macrocyclization&#8211;aromatization cascade that enables rapid access to natural and unnatural RMs. Using this route, we generated a small panel of minimal RMs, introducing covalent warheads, double bonds for macrocycle rigidification, and modifications at the C15 position, a position that has not been modified before. We also synthesized macrocyclic peptide&#8208;RM hybrids, offering a platform for rapid diversification. We evaluated all analogs for inhibitory activity against Hsp90&#945; and Hsp90&#946; and for disruption of the KRasG12C&#8211;CRAF protein&#8211;protein interaction (PPI). We found that introduction of polar groups at C15 improved Hsp90 activity relative to the representative RM de&#8208;O&#8208;methyllasiodiplodin, dependent on stereochemistry, whereas introduction of larger groups at C15 or introduction of a trans double bond into the macrocycle reduced activity. Two analogs with poor Hsp90 inhibitory activity exhibited dose&#8208;dependent inhibition of the KRasG12C&#8211;CRAF PPI. This work demonstrates that strategic modifications of a minimal RM scaffold through modular chemical insight can provide foundational structure&#8211;activity relationships for the class.

         <title>Ionic Liquid&#8208;Modified Resorcinol Formaldehyde Resins: Synthesis and Applications to Methylene Blue Removal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The order in the recipe matters! New semiconducting resorcinol&#8208;formaldehyde resins (RFs) have been synthesized using butyl&#8208;methylimidazolium methylcarbonate ionic liquid. Depending on the pre&#8208; or post&#8208;functionalization strategies, new materials present different benefits: dispersity control, variation of the band gap, and significant improvement the absorption properties toward methylene blue.








Abstract
Two new imidazolium&#8208;functionalized resorcinol&#8208;formaldehyde resins RFs were synthesized, using butyl&#8208;methyl imidazolium resorcinate [C1C4Im][Res] as a new precursor or using a post&#8208;functionalization method. During its synthesis, [C1C4Im][Res] spontenaously co&#8208;crystallizes with resorcinol (in a 1: 1 stoichiometry): the crystal structure shows H&#8208;bonds between resorcinol and resorcinate, and rarely observed &#960;+&#8211;&#960;&#8722; and C&#8211;H &#8211; &#960; interactions between the imidazolium ring and resorcinate. New RFs presented substantial decreases of the band gap compared to unmodified RF (2.0&#8211;1.72 eV). The use of [C1C4Im][Res] significantly improves particle size uniformity compared to unmodified RF, whereas the post&#8208;functionalization method partially degrades their structure. As RF, the two new resins efficiently catalyze the photodegradation of the methylene blue cation, and the post&#8208;functionalized resin has excellent adsorption properties for this&#160;dye.

         <title>Ca2+ Stabilized by Carborate Anions: Synthesis, Structure and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The syntheses of calcium carborates, Ca[HexCB11Cl11]2, 1, Ca[HCB11Cl11]2, 2, and Ca[MeCB11Cl11]2&#183;2(o&#8208;DFB), 3&#183;2(o&#8208;DFB), (o&#8208;DFB = 1,2&#8208;difluorobenzene) including the structure of 2&#183;4(o&#8208;DFB) are described. The large size of the Ca2+ cation is reflected by the coordination geometry with the Ca center being coordinated by three Cl donors from each of the carborate anions and one F donor from each of the two coordinated solvent molecules. Based on 11B NMR and DOSY NMR studies the salts 1, 2 and 2&#183;2(o&#8208;DFB) form close ion pairs in PhBr and o&#8208;DFB solutions. The Fluoride Ion Affinities (FIA) in PhBr for the salts 1 and 2&#183;2(o&#8208;DFB) were DFT&#8208;calculated (&#969;B97XD/6&#8211;31 + G**) at 211.3 kJ mol&#8208;1 and 217.5 kJ mol&#8208;1, respectively, which is below that of the landmark Lewis acid B(C6F5)3 (241.5 kJ mol&#8208;1). The Ca2+ center in salt 1 is sufficiently Lewis acidic to coordinate 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene (1,5&#8208;COD) and 2,6&#8208;octadiyne and to catalyze the hydrosilylation of 1&#8208;hexene and several alkynes, albeit slowly.

The large size of the Ca2+ cation is reflected by the coordination geometry with the Ca center being coordinated by three Cl donors from each of the carborate anions and one F donor from each of the two coordinated solvent molecules. Based on 11B NMR and DOSY NMR studies the salts 1, 2 and 2&#183;2(o-DFB) form close ion pairs in PhBr and o-DFB solutions. The Fluoride Ion Affinities (FIA) in PhBr for the salts 1 and 2&#183;2(o-DFB) were DFT-calculated (&#969;B97XD/6&#8211;31 + G**) at 211.3 kJ mol-1 and 217.5 kJ mol-1, respectively, which is below that of the landmark Lewis acid B(C6F5)3 (241.5 kJ mol-1). The Ca2+ center in salt 1 is sufficiently Lewis acidic to coordinate 1,5-cyclooctadiene (1,5-COD) and 2,6-octadiyne and to catalyze the hydrosilylation of 1-hexene and several alkynes, albeit slowly. Compound 1 also displays moderate activity as catalyst for transfer hydrogenation catalysis and carbonyl-olefin metathesis, a first for Ca compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nitrile Hydroboration by Cooperative Iron Catalysis: An Experimental and Computational Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reductive amination is a challenging reaction in catalysis that often gives poor yield and selectivity. We present an ironcatalyzed approach of synthesizing amines through reduction of nitriles through hydroboration with good yield under ambient conditions. Our detailed mechanistic study establishes the factors that influence the selectivity and turnover. The kinetics and mechanism of the iron&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration of benzonitrile to bis(boryl)benzylamine has been investigated by initial rates, temperature dependence, kinetic isotope effects and computational studies. In contrast to other iron&#8208;catalyzed nitrile hydroboration, this study reveals that B&#8211;H bond activation is not rate&#8208;determining. Moreover, the rate&#8208;determining step was revealed to be C&#8211;H bond reductive elimination with an equilibrium isotope effect in operation. Through this combined approached, an Fe(0)/(II) catalytic manifold proceeding via metal&#8208;ligand cooperativity has been determined.</dc:description>

         <title>Removal of Phaeocystis globosa from seawater via polyvinylpyrrolidone&#8208;modified pyrite activated persulfate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phaeocystis globosa (P. globosa) is a highly motile and toxic harmful algal bloom (HAB) species in marine environments. The outbreak of P. globosa poses severe threats to aquaculture and coastal nuclear power safety, and causes economic losses. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore novel algal removal technologies to control P. globosa blooms. Herein, polyvinylpyrrolidone modified pyrite (PVP&#8208;FeS2) was synthesized as a catalyst to activate persulfate (PS) for removing P. globosa in seawater. The introduction of PVP effectively modulated the morphology, particle size, and catalytic performance of FeS2. The results demonstrated that a system containing 0.3 g/L PVP&#8208;FeS2 and 0.8 mM PS achieved 95.9% removal efficiency of P. globosa within 4 h. The Fe and S species on the PVP&#8208;FeS2 surface played critical roles in activating PS to generate hydroxyl radicals (&#183;OH) for algal cell oxidation, and produce iron hydroxides to promote the flocculation of algal cells. In addition, the PVP&#8208;FeS2/PS system maintained the integrity of algal cells and avoid the release of large amounts of intracellular organic matter. More importantly, the PVP&#8208;FeS2/PS system can simultaneously remove multiple HABs from seawater, and is expected to be applied in the field of emergency mitigation of red tide events.</dc:description>

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Alkylation of Ketones Using Primary Alcohols: Unveiling the Role of Manganese&#8208;Salen Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones with primary alcohols has been systematically investigated using two distinct phosphine&#8208;free Manganese&#8208;complexes (Mn&#8208;ph and Mn&#8208;en) bearing tetradentate Salen ligands. Remarkably, the complex Mn&#8208;ph with aromatic imine bridge was found to be efficient in comparison to Mn&#8208;en, leading to excellent yield of &#945;&#8208;alkylated ketone with good selectivity under operationally convenient conditions. Interestingly, a wide range of aromatic, cyclic, and heterocyclic ketones are effectively alkylated under the optimized reaction conditions. Notably, the transformation proceeds via an environmentally benign and atom&#8208;efficient pathway, generating water as the sole byproduct. The control experiments reveal the involvement of dehydrogenation of alcohols and hydrogen autotransfer (HA) pathway. These findings highlight the potential of Mn(II)&#8208;salen complexes in catalytic HA processes, expanding their applications in sustainable C&#8722;C bond formation strategies.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Polyelectrolyte Film for Spontaneous Electricity Generation with Photoresponsive Output Signals and Intrinsic Recyclability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing recyclable polymeric films for spontaneous power generation with stimuli&#8208;responsive output signals is a significant step towards sustainable wearable sensors, fashion textiles, etc., which remains highly challenging. Herein, we developed polyelectrolyte films for moisture&#8208;sorption&#8208;based electricity generation with photoresponsive electrical output signals from supramolecular co&#8208;assembly of alkaline solutions of lipoic acid (LA) and hyaluronic acid (HA) with amphiphilic azobenzene dopant and ionic liquid via an evaporation&#8208;induced polymerization process. Due to the intrinsic hygroscopic property and layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer structure with water channels, the corresponding polyelectrolyte films can absorb ambient moisture to induce charged ions dissociation and ion flow in the water channels, enabling spontaneous electricity generation. The polyelectrolyte film (0.4 cm &#215; 1.5 cm) generated currents up to 11.8 nA at ambient conditions (21.6 &#176;C and 69% RH). Notably, an immediate increase of current signal was observed by exposure to UV light because of variations in molecular geometry and polarity of the azobenzene dopant between trans and cis isomers. Besides, the polyelectrolyte films were easily recycled by dissolving in water and subsequent re&#8208;evaporation. The results demonstrated a new and simple pathway for developing recyclable supramolecular materials featuring spontaneous electricity generation with photoresponsive output signals, providing attractive opportunities for future sustainable advanced materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulated &#946;&#8208;phase crystallization of strong and tough polypropylene through hyperbranched topology</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving both enhanced strength and improved toughness of polypropylene (PP) remains a significant challenge for industrial applications. The present study addresses this limitation by constructing a robust crystalline network through the strategic integration of hyperbranched topology. We demonstrate that a hyperbranched nucleating agent (HBPN) effectively induces high&#8208;content &#946;&#8208;crystal formation in PP, which organizes into an interconnected crystalline architecture. This &#946;&#8208;phase network significantly enhances the mechanical performance of PP, with tensile strength and notched impact strength increasing by 35.78 % (to 42.5 MPa) and 140 % (to 13.2 KJ/m&#178;), respectively, compared to pure PP. Mechanistic studies reveal that the synergy between strength and toughness originates from HBPN mediated &#946;&#8208;phase crystallization, which refines the morphology of spherulites and increases the degree of crystallinity. The hyperbranched topology of HBPN inhibits entangled PP chains and facilitates crystallization of PP chains. Thus, it contributes efficient stress redistribution by dissipating localized energy through multidirectional load transfer, while arresting crack advancement via microvoid&#8208;induced stress relaxation. This work demonstrates an effective conceptual approach to engineering high&#8208;performance PP, unlocking its potential for various value&#8208;added applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Diethenyl Sulfoximine (DESI) as an Irreversible Lysine&#8208;Targeting Warhead Enables the Design of Covalent Allosteric EGFR Inhibitor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Targeting lysine residues with covalent inhibitors is challenging due to their abundance in the proteome and the protonation of lysine's &#949;&#8208;amino group, which diminishes its reactivity. This study introduces diethenyl sulfoximine (DESI) as a novel bio&#8208;orthogonal aminophilic electrophile which can react with lysine via double conjugate addition to form a cyclic adduct. The second addition promotes the entire and efficient electrophilic attack by the &#949;&#8208;amino of lysine on the ethenyl groups. DESI exhibits superior aqueous stability, overcoming the hydrolysis issue encountered by most reported lysine&#8208;targeting covalent agents. Incorporation of DESI in the allosteric pocket binder EAI045 of oncoprotein epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) yields compound 4, which specifically reacts to the catalytic lysine (Lys745). Compound 4 showed potent inhibition of EGFR&#8208;driven cell proliferation with IC50 values of 0.789 &#181;M and 1.22 &#181;M in engineered BaF3&#8208;EGFRL858R/T790M/C797S and NCI&#8208;H1975 cells, respectively, overcoming EAI045's limitation of lack in cellular potency as a single agent. Tyrosine kinases panel profiling confirmed selectivity toward mutant EGFR while sparing the wild type with minimal off&#8208;targets. These findings highlight DESI's potential as a versatile strategy for targeting lysine residues irreversibly, offering solutions to overcome drug resistance in cancer therapy and advance next&#8208;generation precision medicines.</dc:description>

Compound 4 showed potent inhibition of EGFR-driven cell proliferation with IC50 values of 0.789 &#181;M and 1.22 &#181;M in engineered BaF3-EGFRL858R/T790M/C797S and NCI-H1975 cells, respectively, overcoming EAI045's limitation of lack in cellular potency as a single agent. Tyrosine kinases panel profiling confirmed selectivity toward mutant EGFR while sparing the wild type with minimal off-targets. These findings highlight DESI's potential as a versatile strategy for targeting lysine residues irreversibly, offering solutions to overcome drug resistance in cancer therapy and advance next-generation precision medicines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fluorinated trimers for enhancing the stability and solubility of organic small molecules without spectral shifts: Ultrastable ultraviolet absorbers for transparent polyimide films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of highly stable organic small molecules for optical applications is of growing interest. Multimerization of monomeric small molecules can enhance stability via increased &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, but it often reduces solubility and induces undesirable spectral shifts due to &#960;&#8208;extension. To overcome this trade&#8208;off, we report a trimeric small molecule (F&#8208;TPBT) derived from a model monomer (Tinuvin 327) using a 1,3,5&#8208;fluorinated phenyl linker. This design markedly improves thermal stability and solubility while minimizing changes in the optical absorption spectrum. F&#8208;TPBT shows superior thermal properties (5 wt% decomposition temperature = 427&#8239;&#176;C; weight loss after 1&#8239;h at 300&#8239;&#176;C = 0.32&#8239;wt%) and excellent solubility (5.3 wt% in dichloromethane; 6.4 wt% in N&#8208;methylpyrrolidone), with an absorption spectrum nearly identical to that of Tinuvin 327. These properties make F&#8208;TPBT a promising UV light absorber for transparent polyimide films, which require processing above 300&#8239;&#176;C and are widely used in flexible displays. Notably, F&#8208;TPBT&#8208;containing films retain their absorption properties even after 80&#8239;h of accelerated UV irradiation, demonstrating excellent photostability. This study presents a broadly applicable molecular design strategy for enhancing the stability and solubility of organic small molecules while avoiding significant spectral shifts.</dc:description>

         <title>Porous Co@NC Materials Obtained by Pyrolyzing Metal&#8208;Organic Framework&#8208;Supported Multinuclear Metal Clusters for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multinuclear metal clusters Co4O4 were employed as precursors to synthesize metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon materials (Co@NC). The resulting Co@NC with Co nanoparticles and single&#8208;atomic Co&#9472;N4 sites exhibits efficient electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance.








Abstract
The design and development of efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts have become a key challenge for fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries. As a cutting&#8208;edge field in electrocatalysis, single&#8208;atom catalysts have been widely used in ORR due to their maximum atomic utilization and tunable coordination environment. In this study, multinuclear metal clusters were selected as precursors to construct metal nanoparticles and single&#8208;atomic metal sites doped carbon materials for electrocatalytic ORR. Specifically, Co&#8208;based metal clusters Co4O4 were prepared as precursors and Zn&#8208;based zeolitic imidazolate frameworks ZIF&#8208;8 were selected as supports. The resulting metal Co&#8208;supported nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (Co@NC) materials were obtained by pyrolyzing ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;Co4O4 hybrids. Both Co nanoparticles and single&#8208;atomic Co&#8211;N4 sites were observed on porous NC supports. Porous structures were attributed to the departure of Zn and O at the high&#8208;temperature. Co@NC catalyst exhibits a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.86&#160;V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, vs. RHE) for the ORR measured in a 0.1&#160;M KOH solution. This work provides a new idea for constructing single&#8208;atomic catalysts for electrocatalysis using multinuclear metal clusters as active sites.

         <title>Relaxing amid Three: Slow Magnetization Relaxation in Three&#8208;Coordinate Chromium(II) N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Some members of a family of three&#8208;coordinate S&#160;=&#160;2 CrII complexes bearing NHC and amido donors display field&#8208;induced slow magnetization relaxation. Magnetostructural correlations are drawn within this family, and comparisons are made with literature CrII SIMs.








Abstract
Three&#8208;coordinate, paramagnetic CrII complexes of type [Cr(amido)nBnm(NHC)], NHC&#160;=&#160;N, N&#8217;&#8208;bis&#8208;(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (IMes); N, N&#8217;&#8208;bis&#8208;(2,6&#8208;di&#8208;isopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazol(in)&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene, (S)IDiPP; N, N&#8217;&#8208;bis&#8208;(2,6&#8208;di&#8208;isopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazol&#8208;4&#8208;ylidene, (aIDiPP); amido&#160;=&#160;N(SiMe3)2, NH(DiPP); Bn&#160;=&#160;benzyl, n&#160;=&#160;2, m&#160;=&#160;0; n&#160;=&#160;1, m&#160;=&#160;1, were prepared by substitution or aminolysis and thermolysis methods from [Cr{N(SiMe3)2}2(THF)2] or [CrBn2((S)IDiPP)], respectively. Depending on the nature of the NHC and the amido ligands, different geometries at CrII (ranging from distorted trigonal planar, to extended Y&#8208;, compressed Y&#8208;, and distorted T&#8208;shaped) and conformations, were observed. HFEPR spectroscopy was employed to accurately determine spin Hamiltonian parameters, consisting of zero&#8208;field splitting (axial D and rhombic E components) and g&#8208;values,&#160;of five S&#160;=&#160;2 complexes exhibiting D and E/D in the range from &#8722;2.98 to &#8722;1.63&#160;cm&#8722;1 and 0.026&#160;&#8722;&#160;0.069, respectively. AC magnetometry established slow magnetization relaxation in three complexes, operating by Raman or combined Raman&#8208;Orbach processes. Ab initio calculations provided computed zfs&#160;values, in good agreement with those obtained by HFEPR. Magnetostructural comparisons are made within this three&#8208;coordinate CrII family, as well as with previously studied two&#8208; or four&#8208; coordinate CrII complexes.

         <title>Bioorthogonal Click&#8208;to&#8208;Release of Branched Pro&#8208;Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioorthogonal click&#8208;to&#8208;release prodrug activation strategies should be fast and high yielding. However, in strain&#8208;promoted alkene&#8208;azide click&#8208;to&#8208;release, a fast click&#8208;step translates to slow and inefficient drug release. To improve drug yield, branched dual&#8208;core scaffolds that increase drug release are reported. The dual&#8208;core consists of an exposed electron&#8208;deficient aryl azide (core&#8208;1) attached to an electron&#8208;rich self&#8208;immolating branched linker (core&#8208;2). Core&#8208;1, a tetrafluoroaryl azide with methyl&#8208;substitution at the benzylic carbon, facilitates a rapid click reaction with trans&#8208;cyclooctenes (TCOs). Core&#8208;2 had an N&#8208;methyl carbamate or ether linker and a 1,4/1,4&#8208; or 1,4/1,6&#8208;self&#8208;immolating scaffold. Various release rates of a fluorophore were observed across the series, with 1,4/1,6&#8208;self&#8208;immolating core&#8208;2, linked via the N&#8208;methyl carbamate, having sustained and enhanced fluorophore release. The second order rate constant for cycloaddition of this 1,4/1,6&#8208;self&#8208;immolating analogue and d&#8208;TCO is, to the best of our knowledge, the fastest to date (22.0 M&#8208;1 s&#8208;1). A persistent intermediate was observed, leading to a long, sustained release of fluorophore from the branched scaffold, though activation under acidic conditions (pH = 5.5) led to &#8776;15% higher fluorophore release compared to activation at pH 7.4. Therefore, combinations of core&#8208;1 and core&#8208;2 could improve future pre&#8208;targeted in vivo bioorthogonal click&#8208;to&#8208;release prodrug strategies, especially in the acidic tumour environment.</dc:description>

Therefore, combinations of core-1 and core-2 could improve future pre-targeted in vivo bioorthogonal click-to-release prodrug strategies, especially in the acidic tumour environment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Understanding the SN2 Versus E2 Competition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We provide an intuitive framework rooted in quantitative molecular orbital theory to understand the factors that govern the competition between the SN2 and E2 reaction pathways. The guiding concepts are: characteristic distortivity, transition state acidity, intrinsic nucleophilicity, and apparent nucleophilicity.








Abstract
Bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN2) and base&#8208;induced elimination (E2) generally compete, and it is, therefore, essential to be in control of this competition in synthetic organic chemistry. Herein, we establish guiding principles based on quantitative molecular orbital (MO) theory and the activation strain model to understand and tune the competition between the SN2 and E2 reactions. We discuss the role of key factors, such as the nature of the Lewis base, leaving group, substrate structure, and the solvent. To this end, we introduce the concepts of characteristic distortivity, transition state acidity, intrinsic nucleophilicity, and apparent nucleophilicity. These intuitive concepts equip chemists with conceptual tools to better understand and design reactions for organic synthesis.

         <title>Crystal Structure of Carbonic Acid (H2CO3) at&#160; Elevated Pressures from Single Crystal Diffraction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single crystals of carbonic acid (H2CO3) were synthesized in a laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cell at moderate pressures between 5&#8208;13 GPa by reacting H2O with CO2. Its monoclinic crystal structure (P21/n with Z = 4) has been obtained from synchrotron single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments at ~8 GPa. The positions of the hydrogen atoms have been determined from the experimental data. Density functional theory&#8208;based calculations in combination with experimental Raman spectroscopy confirmed the structural model derived from the diffraction data. This is the first single crystal structure solution of water&#8208;free carbonic acid, H2CO3. The structural model provided here differs from structural models reported earlier for lower pressures derived from neutron powder diffraction data.</dc:description>

         <title>Machine Learning Interatomic Potential&#8208;Enabled Discovery of Chlorofullerenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chlorination is an effective method for stabilizing fullerenes with pentagon adjacencies, transforming reactive sp2 carbon sites into sp3 hybridization to release local strain and reorganize orbital and spin distributions. Yet, the immense variety of fullerene isomers and their diverse chlorination sites pose significant challenges for accurate structural prediction. This study introduces a DFT&#8208;accurate machine learning potential (MLP) for the C&#8208;Cl system, facilitating high&#8208;throughput screening of chlorinated fullerenes. The MLP precisely replicates a range of experimentally identified chlorofullerenes and establishes correlations between parent fullerenes and their chlorinated derivatives in terms of structural features and stability, offering theoretical insights into the formation principles of chlorofullerenes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, we report a palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative annulation of 2&#8208;arylimidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines with maleimides, representing the first example of the regioselectivity reversal for this class of substrates. Notably, the transformation proceeds efficiently with a low catalyst loading (1.5 mol %). A plausible reaction mechanism is proposed, supported by control experiments and in situ HRMS analysis. Photophysical investigations of the annulated products reveal moderate to high quantum yields, highlighting their potential for optoelectronic applications. Furthermore, these molecules demonstrate promising sensitivity as picric acid&#8208;sensing probes.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Activated Molecules Targeting G&#8208;Quadruplex Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We shine a spotlight on the molecular recognition mechanisms and phototherapeutic potential of light&#8209;activated compounds targeting G&#8209;quadruplex nucleic acids, critically evaluating recent breakthroughs and charting the key challenges that must be overcome to drive this promising field forward.








Abstract
Phototherapies harness light's spatial and temporal precision to noninvasively modulate biomolecular interactions, providing a powerful platform for precision oncology. This approach is particularly effective in targeting disease&#8208;associated molecular structures such as G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s), noncanonical nucleic acid conformations found in oncogene promoters and telomeres. These unique structures can impede DNA polymerase progression along the duplex, triggering DNA damage that ultimately compromises genomic stability. Stabilizing G4s with tailored ligands is currently being explored as a promising anticancer strategy, as it may induce toxic DNA damage specifically in rapidly dividing cancer cells. Unlike conventional G4 ligands, which remain continuously active, newly developed light&#8208;responsive molecules incorporate an OFF&#8208;ON switching mechanism that allows for spatiotemporal control over G4 dynamics and phototherapeutic effects. This concept article reviews a diverse array of light&#8208;responsive molecular tools, including photosensitizers (PSs), photocages, photochemically transformed ligands, and photoswitches, that selectively modulate G4&#8208;interactive binding properties, thereby laying the foundation for a versatile photopharmacological platform. Additionally, the article highlights recent advancements in this rapidly evolving field and discusses the challenges that remain for clinical translation, underscoring the significant potential of G4&#8208;targeted phototherapies to shape next&#8208;generation cancer treatments.

A set of new Ru(II)&#8208;CNC pincer complexes with benzimidazolylidenes and their catalytic activity toward &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones using primary alcohols is reported. These complexes can operate via inner&#8208; and outer&#8208;sphere mechanisms for the alcohol dehydrogenation step; however, the outer&#8208;sphere path is favored for the subsequent steps. The outer&#8208;sphere hydride transfer is found to be supported by &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions as a new type of metal&#8211;ligand cooperativity.








Abstract
A set of phosphine&#8208;free Ru(II)&#8208;CNC pincer complexes with benzimidazolylidene&#8208;based CNC&#8208;ligands has been synthesized and characterized, which show excellent catalytic activity toward &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones using primary alcohols. DFT investigations revealed that these seemingly nonbifunctional complexes can operate via inner&#8208; and outer&#8208;sphere mechanisms for the alcohol dehydrogenation step; however, the outer&#8208;sphere path is favored for the subsequent steps. The outer&#8208;sphere path is found to be supported by &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction between the extended aromatic ring system of the benzimidazolylidene&#8208;based CNC&#8208;ligand and aromatic rings of the substrates in a new, unprecedented case of metal&#8211;ligand cooperativity.

         <title>Fine Tuning of the Redox&#8208;Active Diguanidine Ligand in Cationic Cobalt Complexes for Electronic Structure Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work we show that the redox chemistry of hexacoordinated cobalt complexes with redox&#8208;active diguanidine ligands could be tuned by modifying the diguanidine and/or the co&#8208;ligands. In this way, one&#8208;electron oxidation could be directed to be either ligand&#8208; or metal&#8208;centered, leading to high&#8208;spin CoII complexes with an oxidized, radical&#8208;monocationic diguanidine ligand (ligand&#8208;centered oxidation), or low&#8208;spin CoIII complexes with a reduced, neutral diguanidine ligand. Further fine tuning of the redox&#8208;active diguanidine ligand leads to a harmonization of the energies of both redox isomers. Consequently, ligand&#8208; as well as metal&#8208;centered one&#8208;electron oxidation is observed, resulting in a mixture of both redox isomers. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations confirm the energetic proximity of the two redox isomers in this bistable system. The results of this work contribute to the development of a directed approach toward the design of bistable cobalt&#8208;guanidine complexes and their possible applications in spin switching devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding Small Molecule Activation Promoted by Heavier Benzene 1,4&#8208;diides: Interplay Between Diradical Character and Aromaticity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intricate relationship between diradical character, aromaticity, and reactivity in annulated heavier Group 14 benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diides (see picture) has been investigated through Density Functional Theory and ab initio calculations. A direct correlation between reactivity and diradical character, both of which increase down Group 14, is found.








Abstract
The intricate relationship between diradical character, aromaticity, and reactivity in annulated heavier Group 14 benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diides, that is, [(ADC)E]2 (E&#160;=&#160;Si, Ge, Sn), based on an anionic dicarbene framework, (ADC&#160;=&#160;PhC{N(Ar)C}2: Ar&#160;=&#160;aryl), has been investigated through Density Functional Theory and ab initio calculations. The diradical character of both homo&#8208; [(ADC)E]2 and heteroleptic [(ADC)2EE'] systems (E &#8800; E') has been accurately computed, while the aromaticity of their corresponding closed&#8208;shell (CS) and open&#8208;shell (OS) singlet states has been evaluated using magnetic descriptors. Additionally, the key factors governing dihydrogen activation and cycloaddition with acetylene have been quantitatively analyzed in detail by applying the combination of the Activation Strain Model (ASM) of reactivity and Energy Decomposition Analysis (EDA) methods. The findings reveal a direct correlation between reactivity and diradical character, both of which increase down Group 14.

         <title>Effects of Fluorine Substitution on the Human Telomeric RNA G&#8208;Quadruplex Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2&#8242;&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;fluoroarabinoguanosine (2&#8242;F&#8208;araG) at specific positions in the human telomeric RNA sequence allows remarkable stabilization of the parallel&#8208;type G&#8208;quadruplex structure. The mechanism of this stabilization results from electrostatic interactions via pseudo hydrogen bonds, induced by the effect of fluorine substitution in local nucleoside.








Abstract
DNA G&#8208;quadruplex structures can adopt different topologies, whereas RNA G4 predominantly forms parallel&#8208;type structures. While previous studies have reported the stabilization of DNA G&#8208;quadruplex topologies using syn&#8208;favored nucleosides, stabilization of parallel&#8208;type RNA G&#8208;quadruplexes through chemical modification remains unachieved. Here, we demonstrate that substitution with 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;fluoroarabinoguanosine (2&#8242;F&#8208;araG) at specific positions in the human telomeric RNA sequence stabilizes the parallel&#8208;type G&#8208;quadruplex structure. This stabilization arises from electrostatic interactions via pseudo hydrogen bonds, induced by the 2&#8242;F&#8208;araG modification.

         <title>Rapid and Efficient Solid&#8208;State Mechanosynthesis of Bipyridine Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanochemistry reaction of more than 10 metallic precursors of Ru, Ir, Pt, Pd, Fe, and Co with 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine afford the target complexes in high yield, in a short reaction time with very low E&#8208;factor and excellent Effective Mass Yield (EMY) values respect to of conventional solvothermal synthesis.








Abstract
2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine is considered to be the most widely used chelating ligand and it has been extensively studied especially in the areas of coordination chemistry, medicine, materials, and catalysis. A mechanochemical reaction is a process that involves the application of mechanical energy and it provides a high yield in a shorter reaction time and eliminates the need for bulk solvents, typically request in solvothermal reaction.
Notwithstanding the importance of the synthesis of bipyridine&#8208;metal compounds for several decades and recent advancements in the mechanochemical synthesis the development of a mechanochemical protocol for the synthesis of metal complexes bearing bipyridine remains unexplored.
In this work, we extensively studied the mechanochemistry reaction of more than 10 metallic precursors of Ru, Ir, Pt, Pd, Fe, and Co with 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine in different stoichiometric ratio without utilization of bulk solvents, under ambient conditions and without air&#8208;sensitive procedures. A comparison of the yield, reaction time, temperature, frequency, green metrics (E&#8208;factor and the Effective Mass Yield (EMY)) of conventional solvothermal methodologies and mechanochemical synthesis clearly indicates that the mechanochemical approach is more sustainable and efficient. Mechanochemistry approach can be complementary to common solvothermal approach, and in the future, it will be required greater attention in the field of organometallic chemistry.

         <title>Efficient Photocatalytic Degradation of Methylene Blue from Aqueous Solution Using Hybrid Biomass&#8208;Derived Nanostructured Carbon&#8208;TiO2 Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Industrial dye usage results in substantial wastewater discharge, posing environmental and health hazards. Hence, developing efficient, sustainable, and cost&#8208;effective treatment technologies is crucial. Photocatalysis using TiO2 has emerged as a promising approach for dye degradation. This study explores the photocatalytic removal of methylene blue (MB), a model dye pollutant, using a composite of biomass&#8208;derived carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) and nanosized TiO2 under UV light. The CNPs were synthesized via one&#8208;step pyrolysis from waste coffee leaves, offering a sustainable carbon source. The resulting carbon nanospheres (CL&#8208;10) and the TiO2&#8208;CNP composite (PC@CL&#8208;10) were thoroughly characterized using advanced techniques. Incorporating carbon significantly reduces the band gap of TiO2 from ~3.2 eV to 2.91 eV, enhancing photocatalytic activity. Degradation studies under varying catalyst doses, dye concentrations, and pH levels demonstrate effective MB removal under UV irradiation. Photocatalytic experiments revealed up to 99% degradation of MB under UV light, while tests conducted in the dark showed negligible activity, confirming the light&#8208;dependent efficiency. Kinetic analysis indicated that intra&#8208;particle diffusion governs the dye degradation process. Moreover, recyclability tests over six&#8208;cycles showed consistent performance with minimal decline, highlighting the catalyst&#8217;s stability and reusability.</dc:description>

         <title>Acceptor&#8208;Adaptive Automated Glycosylation Optimization For Automated Glycan Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optimization of glycosylation temperatures is essential for automated solid phase glycan assembly. Constructing a reliable optimization system that mimics key reaction components is crucial for increasing the atom economy and the energy efficiency of the process.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Optimization of glycosylation temperatures is essential for automated solid phase glycan assembly. Constructing a reliable optimization system that mimics key reaction components is crucial for increasing the atom economy and the energy efficiency of the process. Although glycosyl acceptors play a pivotal role in glycosylation, evaluating their effect on glycosylation efficiency is nontrivial. While screening various glycosyl acceptors for optimization is impractical, compromising for simple alkyl acceptors produces results of dubious relevance. We demonstrate that optimization with a modified trans-4-aminocyclohexanol-based acceptor accurately reflects the optimal glycosylation temperature of several glycosyl acceptors, overcoming previous limitations.

         <title>Low&#8208;Valent Group 14 Species Supported by BICAAC: Isolation of a Germylone and a Digermanium Compound</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study deals with the syntheses, isolation, and characterization of tricoordinate bicyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (BICAAC) adducts with germylene and stannylene halides. Subsequent KC8 reduction of BICAAC&#8208;germylene adducts afforded a bent (BICAAC)2Ge(0) species and a BICAAC stabilized trans&#8208;bent (Ge&#9552;Ge) digermanium complex. The reactivity of BICAAC&#8208;SnX2 adducts were investigated toward complexation with Fe2(CO)9, which afforded the corresponding donor&#8208;acceptor (Sn&#8594;Fe) metal adducts.








Abstract
Herein, we have disclosed the successful isolation and spectroscopic characterization of a series of bicyclic (alkyl)(amino) carbene (Me/iPrBICAAC) complexes of GeCl2 and SnX2; [MeBICAAC&#8208;GeCl2 (1); iPrBICAAC&#8208;GeCl2 (2); MeBICAAC&#8208;SnX2 (X = Cl (3); X = Br, (4))]. The in&#8208;situ KC8 reduction of GeCl2&#183;dioxane in the presence of MeBICAAC led to the isolation of a zero&#8208;valent di&#8208;coordinated germylone [(MeBICAAC)2Ge] (5), whereas the reduction of adduct 2 afforded a trans&#8208;bent digermanium complex, [iPrBICAAC&#8594;Ge&#9552;Ge&#8592;iPrBICAAC] (6), having a Ge&#9552;Ge (2.3652(5) &#197;) double bond. Additionally, complexes 3 and 4 were reacted with diironnonacarbonyl Fe2(CO)9 to produce the corresponding Sn&#8594;Fe adducts 7 and 8, respectively. Further, attempts were made to convert the MeBICAAC&#8208;Sn adducts 3 and 4 to the corresponding tin&#8208;hydride complex, by treatment with LiBH4, however, in both the attempts, uncontrolled hydrogenation occurred to give the dihydrogented MeBICAAC complex, MeBICAAC(H2) (9). The solid&#8208;state structures of compounds 1&#8211;8 have also been elucidated using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction technique. Further, computational investigations were performed to explain the bonding situation in 3&#8211;8 that establishes the ylidone character of 5, and supports the formation of 7&#8211;8 via donation of the lone pair at Sn to the Fe center.

         <title>Titanium cis&#8208;DACH Salan Catalyst for the Efficient Epoxidation of Nonactivated Olefins with Hydrogen Peroxide&#8208;Terminal&#8208;Selective Epoxidation of Multiply Unsaturated Terpenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Terminal&#8208;selective epoxidation&#8211;catalytic, simple, and with H2O2 as oxidant. The titanium complex of a new type of salan ligand, accessible in one step from cis&#8208;DACH and 3&#8208;(pentafluorophenyl)salicylic aldehyde, is an efficient catalyst for the epoxidation of nonconjugated olefins with H2O2. Most importantly, the novel catalyst is highly regioselective for terminal double bond epoxidation when multiply unsaturated substrates are employed.








Abstract
We report a new generation of highly active and readily available homogeneous titanium catalysts for the epoxidation of nonactivated olefins with aqueous hydrogen peroxide. Key feature is the introduction of pentafluorophenyl substituents into a salan ligand derived from cis&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane (cis&#8208;DACH). Our novel salan ligand is accessible in one single step by reductive alkylation of cis&#8208;DACH with 3&#8208;(pentafluorophenyl)salicylic aldehyde. In situ complexation with Ti(OiPr)4 of the cis&#8208;DACH salan provides the titanium catalyst, which, in the presence of aqueous hydrogen peroxide, smoothly epoxidizes a broad spectrum of olefins with up to 95% yield at a catalyst loading of 0.5&#160;mol&#8208;% only. The achiral cis&#8208;DACH salan catalyst showed syn&#8208;selectivity (4.7:1) in the epoxidation of a chiral, racemic terminal allylic alcohol. This catalyst furthermore allows the regioselective (up to 49:1) epoxidation of the terminal double bond in multiply unsaturated terpenes such as myrcene, (S)&#8208;citronellene, and (R)&#8208;linalool. For the latter two substrates, syn/anti&#8208;selectivity of up to 9:1 was observed. Augmented syn/anti selectivity (up to 50:1 syn or 25:1 anti) can be induced in the epoxidation of the chiral substrates (S)&#8208;citronellene and (R)&#8208;linalool when the &#8220;matched&#8221; enantiomer of the chiral &#8220;Berkessel salalen ligand&#8221; is employed.

         <title>Pulsed Electrolysis Promotes CO2 Reduction on Tin Oxide Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study compared electrochemical CO2 reduction performance catalyzed by SnO2 under constant cathodic potential (Ec) and pulsed modes with periodic cathodic (Ec) and anodic (Ea) potentials. The latter strategy shows higher formate selectivity because pulsed electrolysis can regenerate active SnOx phase. This work enables the control of CO2 reduction selectivity by tuning the applied potential program.








Abstract
The performance of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is determined by multiple factors, including the optimization of catalysts and electrolyser, along with the electrolysis technique. Recently, pulsed electrolysis has been found to tailor the selectivity and prolong the stability of CO2RR on a variety of catalysts, with the most focus on Cu&#8208;based materials. The investigation of pulsed electrolysis on Sn&#8208;based materials remains at early stage. Herein, we evaluate the CO2 reduction selectivity of tin oxide electrocatalyst under constant potential electrolysis (CPE) and pulsed potential electrolysis (PPE). Tin oxide achieves higher selectivity toward formate under PPE conditions in comparison with CPE. Induced by applied potential, tin oxide catalyst undergoes obvious reconstruction and into the composite of Sn&#8208;SnO2 in the process of CO2 reduction under both PPE and CPE conditions. The high selectivity under PPE condition is ascribed to the formation of SnOx on the catalyst surface due to the applied anodic potential.

         <title>Accessing Single&#8208;Molecule Properties of Heptacene Using a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heptacene was synthesized within a MOF through in situ photochemical conversion of the precursor molecule. This approach accelerated the transformation reaction and suppressed the undesirable side reactions of heptacene via geometrical constraints. The bulk production of isolated heptacene molecules enabled the exploration of single&#8208;molecule properties, revealing the elusive electronic ground state of pristine heptacene.








Abstract
Acenes, classic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons composed of linearly fused benzene rings, represent a model system for exploring the physical properties of 1D &#960;&#8208;conjugated structures. Isolating individual molecules at the single&#8208;molecule level provides a means to investigate their intrinsic properties, which is typically done by dissolving in solutions. However, this approach becomes increasingly difficult to apply for higher acenes owing to their high insolubility and instability. Thus, the electronic structure of higher acenes has long been a subject of intense discussion. This paper introduces a method to encapsulate heptacene within a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) through in situ photochemical conversion of a precursor molecule.

&lt;p&gt;Heptacene was synthesized within a MOF through in situ photochemical conversion of the precursor molecule. This approach accelerated the transformation reaction and suppressed the undesirable side reactions of heptacene via geometrical constraints. The bulk production of isolated heptacene molecules enabled the exploration of single-molecule properties, revealing the elusive electronic ground state of pristine heptacene.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acenes, classic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons composed of linearly fused benzene rings, represent a model system for exploring the physical properties of 1D &#960;-conjugated structures. Isolating individual molecules at the single-molecule level provides a means to investigate their intrinsic properties, which is typically done by dissolving in solutions. However, this approach becomes increasingly difficult to apply for higher acenes owing to their high insolubility and instability. Thus, the electronic structure of higher acenes has long been a subject of intense discussion. This paper introduces a method to encapsulate heptacene within a metal-organic framework (MOF) through in situ photochemical conversion of a precursor molecule. The transformation reaction of the precursor is significantly accelerated upon inclusion. This approach stabilizes otherwise unstable heptacene by suppressing undesirable side reactions through the spatial constraint. The bulk production of heptacene in an isolated state enables its exploration through various analytical techniques, providing insights into its single-molecule properties and leading to the first observation of its fluorescence. Moreover, experimental and theoretical studies reveal the electronic ground state of pristine heptacene.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Continuous Light&#8208;Induced Water Oxidation in Polyoxometalate&#8208;Based Photocatalytic Protocells and Prototissues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic protocells (Ru4PCVs) incorporating a Ru&#8208;based POM synzyme are constructed&#160;via&#160;the membranization of polymer/nucleotide coacervates. In the presence of a photosensitizer and a sacrificial electron acceptor, Ru4CVs are capable of continuously performing light&#8208;induced water oxidation at room temperature. Assembled into tissue&#8208;like sheets and spheroids, Ru4PCVs continue to perform light&#8208;induced water oxidation, showing enhanced activity and higher&#8208;order behaviours.








Abstract
The bottom&#8208;up construction of leaf&#8208;like materials capable of using visible light and water to produce oxygen and chemical energy is a major goal of artificial photosynthesis. In this work, we show that robust artificial cells (protocells) prepared by the membranization of polymer/nucleotide coacervate droplets with a bio&#8208;inspired Ru&#8208;based polyoxometalate (POM) catalytic oxygen&#8208;evolving center are capable of continuous light&#8208;assisted water oxidation at room temperature. We present a method to electrostatically assemble millions of the photocatalytic protocells into tissue&#8208;like protocellular sheets and spheroids and demonstrate that the protocellular assemblies exhibit enhanced rates of photocatalytic water oxidation compared with individual protocells. Our results highlight opportunities for synergistically integrating key aspects of photocatalysis, cytomimetics, and bottom&#8208;up engineering toward the development of modular photosynthetic active matter and applications in artificial photosynthesis and energy capture.

         <title>A Dilute Hybrid Electrolyte with Trimethylolpropane Additive for High&#8208;Voltage Aqueous Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries Operated at Low Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous sodium&#8208;ion batteries (ASIBs) have attracted significant attention due to the advantages of high safety and low cost for energy storage devices. However, the narrow electrochemical stability window (ESW) of aqueous electrolytes and freezing at low temperatures limit practical applications. Herein, we broaden the ESW to 2.85 V and reduce the freezing point (below &#8208;80&#176;C) by using trimethylolpropane (TMP) additive to 1 M NaNO3 aqueous solution. Based on this hybrid electrolyte and equipped with a bimetallic Prussian blue analogue (NaCuHCF) cathode and 3, 4, 9, 10&#8208;perylenetetracarboxylic diimide (PTCDI) anode, the full cells display a specific capacity of 56.6 mAh g&#8208;1, 88% capacity retention after 800 cycles. Even at low temperatures of &#8208;20&#176;C, a specific capacity of 50.1 mAh g&#8208;1 after 500 cycles is also achieved. A series of spectral tests illustrate the interaction between TMP and water molecules which realizes the excellent electrochemical performances, especially at low temperature. This work provides a new strategy for the application of ASIBs in extreme weather and expands the practical application of aqueous batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;step Conversion of Bisphenol A Polycarbonate into Aliphatic Polycarbonate Polyols for Recyclable Polyurethane Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The growing accumulation of plastic waste emphasizes the pressing need for sustainable recycling technologies. In this study, we present a one&#8208;step conversion of bisphenol A based polycarbonate (BPA&#8208;PC) waste into aliphatic polycarbonate (APC) polyols using diols with varying chain lengths. The resulting APC polyols were subsequently utilized as soft segments in combination with 4,4&#8217;&#8208;methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) in the production of thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPUs). These TPUs exhibited excellent mechanical properties, with a maximum tensile strength of 58 MPa and elongation at break of 397%, as well as robust hydrolytic stability, maintaining performance even after prolonged water exposure. Notably, the APC&#8208;based TPUs exhibited excellent recyclability through organocatalytic depolymerization, which facilitated the simultaneous hydrolysis of both urethane and carbonate bonds. This process yielded the selective formation of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;methylenedianiline (MDA), an industrial precursor to MDI, and 1,4&#8208;butanediol (1,4&#8208;BD) with remarkably high yields of 96% and 95%, respectively. This work provides valuable insights into designing closed&#8208;loop recyclable polymers by upcycling plastic waste via a straight&#8208;forward process. Additionally, it offers a practical and impactful solution for the end&#8208;of&#8208;life management of upcycled polyurethane products, thereby contributing to a circular plastic economy.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Backbone thiazole moieties prevail in bioactive peptidic natural products and play important roles in their biological functions. However, the de novo discovery of artificial thiazole&#8208;containing peptide ligands remains challenging. Here, we report an mRNA display&#8208;based selection platform for thiazole&#8208;containing macrocyclic peptides (ThzteMP), established through a dedicated posttranslational chemoenzymatic transformation. This method exploits the unique reactivity of ribosomally incorporated thioamides, enabling enzyme&#8208;free spontaneous heterocyclization to form thiazoline, which is further oxidized using the substrate&#8208;tolerant azoline dehydrogenase (GodE) to yield a thiazole moiety. By integrating this chemoenzymatic process with chloroacetyl&#8208;mediated thioether macrocyclization and mRNA display, we have successfully discovered thiazole&#8208;containing macrocyclic peptide ligands with high binding affinities against p&#8208;21 activated kinase 4 (PAK4). This study establishes a robust system to expedite ligand discovery of pseudo&#8208;natural peptides and to investigate the functional benefit of their backbone thiazoles.</dc:description>

         <title>An Aptamer&#8208;Conjugated AIEgen for Targeted Bioimaging and Photodynamic Therapy of Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has emerged as a promising noninvasive treatment for cancer and other diseases. Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) photosensitizers are excellent candidates for enhancing the efficacy of image&#8208;guided PDT due to their unique properties. DNA&#8208;modified AIE luminogens (AIEgens) offer an effective approach for nucleic acid detection and biospecies sensing, but their applications in tumor cell imaging and image&#8208;guided PDT have been rarely reported. Herein, we designed a light&#8208;up probe, named ApApt, for targeted imaging and image&#8208;guided PDT of cancer cells. The probe was prepared by conjugating AIEgen with aptamer and displayed specific targeting ability to EpCAM&#8208;positive cancer cells. ApApt exhibits good water solubility and shows very low emission in aqueous solution. However, it emits strong fluorescence as a result of the restricted intramolecular motion activation of AIEgens, which is triggered by the specific binding between the aptamer SYL3C and EpCAM protein. Upon delivery to cancer cells, ApApt efficiently generates ROS for targeted PDT under light irradiation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In this study, we explore extended design of metal&#8211;NHC complexes that relies on dual strategies for tuning ligand properties: (i) electronic modulation through &#960;&#8208;extended frameworks such as bis(imino)acenaphthene (BIAN), and (ii) systematic aryl substitution to influence &#963;&#8208;donor strength and steric environment. We report the first integrated exploration of these two strategies on a unified ligand platform. A series of Au(I)/BIAN&#8211;NHCX complexes were synthesized by introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents (X = F, Cl, Br, CF&#8323;) at the ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208;, and para&#8208;positions of the N&#8208;aryl groups. This hybrid tuning approach allowed us to probe the synergistic and antagonistic effects arising from &#960;&#8211;&#963; interplay across multiple dimensions. Each complex was thoroughly characterized with respect to synthetic yield, structural features (including X&#8208;ray structure and dynamics in solution), photophysical properties (UV&#8208;Vis and luminescence), catalytic performance in hydroamination of phenylacetylene, and cytotoxicity in HEK293T cells. Structure&#8211;property correlations revealed distinct cooperative and counteractive regimes depending on the substituent type and position. These findings demonstrate that combining orthogonal electronic control elements enables a more predictive and fine&#8208;grained design of NHC&#8208;based metal complexes, with future implications for catalysis, materials science, and biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>What can be learned from the electrostatic environments within nitrogenase enzymes?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogen fixation is a fundamental, and yet challenging, chemical transformation due to the intrinsic inertness of dinitrogen. Whereas industrial ammonia synthesis relies on the energy&#8208;intensive Haber&#8211;Bosch process, nitrogenase enzymes achieve this transformation under ambient conditions&#8212;yet at the expense of a remarkably high ATP demand. Understanding their mode of operation could inspire the development of more efficient synthetic catalysts. In this study, we scrutinize the electrostatic environment surrounding nitrogenase&#8217;s active site, the so&#8208;called M&#8208;cluster. Strikingly, we observe that all types of M&#8208;clusters exhibit similar trends, with distinct patterns around the individual metal sites that have been proposed as potential N2&#8208;coordination sites. Specifically, a strong local electric field pointing away from the Fe2 site is identified, as well as a minor field pointing towards the Fe6 sites. Furthermore, a significant oriented long&#8208;range field along the Fe2&#8211;Fe6 axis is computed across the entire family of nitrogenases. In the final part of the manuscript, we discuss how the observed electrostatic patterns may impact chemical reactivity, and how they can be connected to previously made mechanistic hypotheses. Overall, this study provides further evidence for the ubiquitousness of local electric fields in enzyme catalysis, even when substrates that seemingly have only limited electrostatic susceptibility are involved.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Oxidative Radical Polar Crossover Route to 1,4&#8208;Keto Carboxylates Mediated by Anchimeric Assistance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 1,4&#8208;keto carboxylate scaffold is present in the structure of many biologically relevant compounds. To date, there are only a branch of methods to prepare them, using either transition metal catalysts, or non&#8208;commercially available and sensitive starting materials. Herein, we describe a sustainable electrochemical methodology starting from commercially available and highly stable 1,3&#8208;diketones and alkenes to prepare 1,4&#8208;keto aryl and alkyl carboxylates in a highly efficient manner, without the need of an external catalyst or harsh reaction conditions. This electrochemical oxidative radical polar crossover transformation presents a broad scope, is compatible with many functional groups, and can even be applied in flow chemistry. In addition, the key stabilization of the intermediate carbocation by anchimeric assistance allows a high diastereo&#8208; and regio&#8208;control of the reaction. Moreover, the utility of these 1,4&#8208;keto carboxylates was demonstrated in several derivatizations and applications in the late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrophobic And Polarized Aromatic Residues Promote Internalization Of Arg&#8208;Rich Cell Penetrating Peptides Through Ionpair&#8208;&#960; Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) are small sequences that can cross cell membranes. Arg and Trp are highly prevalent amino&#8208;acids in natural and synthetic efficient CPP sequences. In particular, Trp is essential and cannot be substituted by other hydrophobic or aromatic amino&#8208;acids. The aim of the present study is to decipher the role of Trp in synthetic Arg/Trp CPP sequences. To do so, a small peptide library in which this residue was substituted by other natural or non&#8208;natural amino&#8208;acids was designed. Internalization of these peptides in cells was evaluated and it appeared that combining aromaticity and hydrophobicity in the presence of Arg residues leads to enhanced internalization. The study of the interaction of these peptides with model lipid membranes revealed that the modulation of hydrophobicity promoted insertion in bilayers, but had little impact on the binding affinity. On the other hand, more hydrophobic substitutes of Trp led to more favorable binding enthalpies to heparin. With DFT analysis, we suggest that ion&#8208;pair&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions between the aromatic ring and the ion pair formed by the positively charges Arg and the negatively charged cell surface groups can be established, and could be at the origin of the unique internalization properties of Trp&#8208;containing Arg&#8208;rich CPPs.</dc:description>

         <title>Small Molecule Donor/Polymer Acceptor Organic Solar Cells with Efficiency of 13.65% Enabled by Film Formation Kinetics and Phase Separation Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optimal donor&#8208;acceptor miscibility and face&#8208;on packing have been achieved with PY2S&#8208;F, which contains F&#8208;substituted end groups. The minimized phase separation leads to OSCs based on small molecular donors and polymer acceptors with a record PCE of 13.65% (JSC&#160;=&#160;20.73&#160;mA cm&#8315;2, FF&#160;=&#160;72.93%).








Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on small molecular donor and polymer acceptor (SD/PA&#8208;type) show low photovoltaic performance due to the unideal morphology. However, previous work mainly focused on the aspects of donors, but how the polymer acceptor influences its morphology and device performances is lacking in study. In this work, we apply three polymerized nonfullerene small molecules as acceptors, combining film&#8208;forming kinetics and microstructure characterization to investigate the efficient SD/PA&#8208;type OSCs requirements on polymers. We found the following two results: Strong miscibility between donor and acceptor would facilitate the acceptor inducing the donor to adopt a face&#8208;on packing; under similar miscibility, the inferior crystallinity of the acceptor facilitates a more proper phase separation. Hence, the DTBDT&#8208;C3&#8208;D6:PY2S&#8208;F&#8208;based SD/PA&#8208;type OSCs with the best miscibility achieve an impressive PCE of 13.65% with both high short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc) of 20.73&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and fill factor (FF) of 72.93%, which are among the highest values in the reported binary SD/PA&#8208;type OSCs so far. Our work provides a new perspective for the development of highly efficient SD/PA&#8208;type OSCs with polymer acceptor matched to small molecule donor.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of&#160;Bimetallic Cu(II) Compounds as Potent Antibacterial and Antibiofilm Agents with Metallo&#8208; &#946; &#8208;Lactamase Inhibitory Activityagainst Multidrug Resistant  Pseudomonas aeruginosa</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this research, a novel class of biologically active bimetallic Cu(II) compounds have been discovered as cutting&#8208;edge antibiofilm agents with metallo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactamase (MBL) inhibitory activity against the clinically isolated multidrug resistant (MDR) gram&#8208;negative bacterium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa&#8208;CI&#8208;1). Thus, the 2,6&#8208;bis[N&#8208;{N&#8208;(carboxymethyl)&#8208;N&#8208;(pyridylmethyl)amine}methyl]&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenol (H3L)&#8208;incorporated three bimetallic Cu(II) compounds, [Cu2L(H2O)(Cl)]&#8729;H2O (1), [Cu2L(H2O)(NO3)]&#8729;H2O (2) and [Cu2L(H2O)(CH3CO2)]&#8729;H2O (3) have been strategically designed and synthesized with unsymmetrical coordination arrangement that synergistically modifies the electronic environment of Cu centres for the enhancement of antibacterial and antibiofilm activity. The standard nitrocefin assay disclosed that 1&#8208;3 significantly inhibited the activity of MBLs produced by Pa&#8208;CI&#8208;1 at their 1/2 MIC doses. Molecular docking study revealed an excellent propensity of these Cu compounds for binding with different MBL&#8208;producing proteins.&#160;All three Cu(II) compounds displayed significantly high antibacterial and antibiofilm activity as established by multiple bioassays, including ex&#8208;vivo applicability studies.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this research, a novel class of biologically active bimetallic Cu(II) compounds have been discovered as cutting-edge antibiofilm agents with metallo-&#946;-lactamase (MBL) inhibitory activity against the clinically isolated multidrug resistant (MDR) gram-negative bacterium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa-CI-1). Thus, the 2,6-bis[N-{N-(carboxymethyl)-N-(pyridylmethyl)amine}methyl]-4-methylphenol (H3L)-incorporated three bimetallic Cu(II) compounds, [Cu2L(H2O)(Cl)]&#8729;H2O (1), [Cu2L(H2O)(NO3)]&#8729;H2O (2) and [Cu2L(H2O)(CH3CO2)]&#8729;H2O (3) have been strategically designed and synthesized with unsymmetrical coordination arrangement that synergistically modifies the electronic environment of Cu centres for the enhancement of antibacterial and antibiofilm activity. The standard nitrocefin assay disclosed that 1-3 significantly inhibited the activity of MBLs produced by Pa-CI-1 at their 1/2 MIC doses. Molecular docking study revealed an excellent propensity of these Cu compounds for binding with different MBL-producing proteins.&#160;All three Cu(II) compounds displayed significantly high antibacterial and antibiofilm activity as established by multiple bioassays, including ex-vivo applicability studies. They showed an exceptional combinatorial activity when examined with commercially accessible five different &#946;-lactam-based antibiotics such as amoxicillin (AMX), chloramphenicol (CHL), cefotaxime (CTX), ceftriaxone (CTR) and Cefoxitin (CX) against Pa-CI-1.

         <title>Scandium&#8208;Catalyzed Highly Selective Deoxygenation of Alcohols by Using Hydrosilanes as Reductants</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we present a straightforward and efficient scandium&#8208;based catalytic system that enables highly selective reduction of &#963; bonds (C&#8211;O) in the presence of more reactive &#960; (C=O) or O&#8211;H bonds. Employing 5&#160;mol% of Sc(OTf)3 as the catalyst, a diverse range of aryl and alkyl hydrosilanes proved to be highly effective in reducing secondary and tertiary alcohols to the corresponding alkanes. Furthermore, this protocol was extended to the deoxygenation of ketones and the hydrodehalogenation of alkyl halides.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Siphonazole B Through Domino Cycloisomerization&#8208;Oxazolonium Ion Rearrangements</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>4&#8208;Alkenyl&#8208; and 4&#8208;acyloxazoles represent important substructures across a diverse array of bioactive molecules. Practical methods to synthesize these motifs are, therefore, of considerable interest. Here, we develop a novel domino process wherein a cycloisomerization is followed by a 1,2&#8208;rearrangement via an oxazolonium ion to yield 4&#8208;alkenyloxazoles from an abundant &#223;&#8208;chloro&#8208;N&#8208;benzyl propargyl amine and acyl chlorides. The synthetic utility of the method is highlighted by its application to both oxazole units of siphonazole B, leading to a concise convergent total synthesis of this natural product.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#160;Dispersion of Copper Nanoparticles on Carbon Black in Minimal Loadings Enhances the Electroreduction of CO2 to CO</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical CO&#8322; reduction (ECR) offers a promising route for converting CO&#8322; emissions into valuable chemicals. To enhance economic viability, the development of efficient and low&#8208;cost catalysts based on non&#8208;noble metals is crucial. This study focuses on copper (Cu) nanoparticles highly dispersed on a carbon black support, synthesized via a solvothermal method that allows for precise control over particle size and loading. We demonstrate that tuning these properties is essential to steer the selectivity of CO&#8322; reduction towards carbon monoxide (CO). Notably, a low catalyst loading of only 0.159 mg/cm&#178; was sufficient to achieve high performance. The optimized catalyst delivered a CO partial current density of 66 mA/cm&#178; (total current density of 100 mA/cm&#178; with 66% Faradaic efficiency for CO) at a cell voltage of 3.2 V. Furthermore, our results highlight the critical role of the gas diffusion layer (GDL), showing that its composition significantly impacts catalyst activity. This underscores the necessity of engineering advanced GDLs with tailored conductivity, stability, and hydrophobicity to further boost the performance of Cu&#8208;based catalysts in CO&#8322; electrolysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigating the Site&#8208;Specific Impact of Fluorine Substitution on Aromatic Interactions in a Tryptophan Zipper Peptide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stability of pairwise tryptophan (Trp) edge&#8208;to&#8208;face aromatic interactions has been exploited in the design of small tryptophan zipper (Trpzip) peptides. Herein, we report a systematic study of the regiospecific impact of four constitutional isomers of non&#8208;natural fluoro&#8208;Trp, regarding their incorporation at either edge&#8208; or face&#8208;position. Single fluorine substituents withdraw electron density from the indole moiety and introduce a highly electronegative component while the native geometry of Trp is maintained. We employed a library approach based on the sequence of Trpzip2 and assessed peptide structure and stability using CD, FTIR, and NMR spectroscopy. Global hairpin stability was improved or compromised upon site&#8208;specific incorporation of a single monofluoro&#8208;Trp regioisomer. Fluorine substitution revealed key CH/&#960; interactions within the Trp/Trp packing and holds potential for the future optimization of aromatic interactions involving Trp.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling Topology of a Telomeric G&#8208;quadruplex DNA with a Chemical Cross&#8208;link</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) are non&#8208;canonical structures formed in guanine&#8208;rich sequences. Within the human genome, they are non&#8208;randomly distributed and influence DNA replication, gene expression and genome maintenance. Numerous proteins involved in these processes have been identified as G4&#8208;binding proteins. However, the interaction of proteins with G4s in the context of double stranded DNA in vitro has been difficult to study due to the transient nature of G4s in the presence of complementary DNA. To overcome this challenge, introducing internal covalent cross&#8208;links between distant nucleotides within the DNA sequence may promote pre&#8208;folding of G4 structures, thereby shifting the thermodynamic equilibrium towards G4&#8208;formation. We used a Cu(I)&#8208;catalysed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition to create a cross&#8208;link between 2'&#8208;O&#8208;propargylguanosine and N6&#8208;azidoethyl&#8208;2'&#8208;deoxyadenosine in the DNA telomeric sequence (TAG3T)2. A cross&#8208;link between G3 and A8 reinforced the parallel G4 topology that was stable in the presence of complementary DNA. Moreover, even in the presence of its complementary strand, this cross&#8208;linked G4 recruited the parent native DNA (TAG3T)2 to form a hybrid G4. These results suggest that cross&#8208;linking provides a useful tool for stabilising non&#8208;canonical DNA structures in the presence of complementary strands, enabling their study within the context of genomic DNA.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of CPA&#8208;Catalyzed&#160;&#946;&#8208;Selective Reductive Amination of Cardenolides for the Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Hydrolytically Stable Analogs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This article describes the development of novel, hydrolytically stable cardiotonic steroid analogs featuring a 3&#946;&#8208;amine moiety instead of the commonly found 3&#946;&#8208;carbohydrates such as oleandrose. To establish the desired 3&#946;&#8208;configuration stereoselectively, a new method based on chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;controlled diastereoselective reductive amination with Hantzsch esters was developed. This method utilizes readily available unsubstituted (S)&#8208;BINOL&#8208;based hydrogen phosphate as the catalyst, enabling the synthesis of 13 different 5&#946;&#8208;androsterone and digitoxigenin analogs with up to 36:1&#946;:&#945;&#160;diastereoselectivity. Additionally, this strategy was applied to generate two novel oleandrigenin analogs&#160;15a&#160;and&#160;15gin 3 steps from readily available gitoxigenin. The synthetic analogs were subjected to the NCI&#8208;60 human tumor cell lines screen, and several different digitoxigenin derivatives with tumor cell growth inhibitory power in submicromolar range were identified. The subsequent&#160;in vitro&#160;evaluation of digitoxigenin and oleandrin derivatives&#160;13a,&#160;13g,&#160;15a, and&#160;15gdemonstrated that these four analogs reduced steady&#8208;state ATP1A1 levels in T98G cells in the 12&#8208;96 nM range. Interestingly, only the oleandrin analog&#160;15g&#160;also lowered also steady&#8208;state levels of the cellular prion protein (PrPC), the main therapeutic target for the treatment of prion diseases.</dc:description>

The synthetic analogs were subjected to the NCI-60 human tumor cell lines screen, and several different digitoxigenin derivatives with tumor cell growth inhibitory power in submicromolar range were identified. The subsequent&#160;in vitro&#160;evaluation of digitoxigenin and oleandrin derivatives&#160;13a,&#160;13g,&#160;15a, and&#160;15gdemonstrated that these four analogs reduced steady-state ATP1A1 levels in T98G cells in the 12-96 nM range. Interestingly, only the oleandrin analog&#160;15g&#160;also lowered also steady-state levels of the cellular prion protein (PrPC), the main therapeutic target for the treatment of prion diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;free Electrode Fabrication for Next&#8208;generation Batteries: Inception or an Endgame?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The challenges and opportunities of the emerging solvent&#8208;free electrode fabrication method are discussed in the conceptual review considering the aspects of environmental impact, cost of production, and the resultant energy density.








Abstract
Solvent&#8208;free electrode fabrication (SEF) is a revolutionary advancement in the field of battery manufacturing, providing a compelling, solvent&#8208;free alternative to conventional slurry&#8208;based processing. SEF offers significant benefits, including reduced energy consumption resulting from the elimination of toxic solvents, solvent recovery steps, a lower environmental impact, overall cost reduction, and overcoming of binder migration, encountered during the fabrication of thicker electrodes. However, the practical application of SEF must overcome key challenges, such as achieving uniform particle distribution, ensuring strong electrode cohesion and adhesion, and scaling up to meet industrial production demands. This review provides a comprehensive assessment of the current landscape in dry electrode fabrication technologies, featuring advanced techniques such as dry pressing, spray dry deposition, and 3D printing. The fundamental chemistry of materials in addition to the mechanical, and electrochemical factors critical for optimizing battery performance is elaborated with a clear focus on lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) from lab to manufacturing stage. Moreover, the article highlights significant recent advancements, identifies critical technical barriers, and outlines imperative research directions necessary to unleash the full potential of dry electrode manufacturing in the realm of sustainable energy storage.

         <title>The Low Oxidation State Paradigm is More Consistent with XFEL Observations of the S&#8323; &#8594; [S&#8324;] &#8594; S&#8320; Transition in Photosystem II</title>

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations within the LOS paradigm reproduce key XFEL observations of the S&#8323; &#8594; [S&#8324;] &#8594; S&#8320; transition in PSII. In contrast to the HOS model, the LOS framework explains both the disappearance of Ox during O&#8211;O bond formation and the unchanged Mn4&#8211;O5 distance in the peroxide intermediate.








Abstract
Photosynthetic water splitting catalyzed by the Mn4CaO5/6 cluster in the oxygen&#8208;evolving complex (OEC) of photosystem II (PSII) is crucial for sustaining the supply of oxygen on the Earth. A recent serial femtosecond X&#8208;ray crystallography (XFEL) study has provided unprecedented insights into the structural dynamics of the OEC during the S&#8323; &#8594; [S&#8324;] &#8594; S&#8320; transition, revealing that this process involves a peroxide intermediate formed via oxo&#8208;oxyl radical coupling between O5 and Ox. However, computational models based on the high oxidation state (HOS) paradigm have failed to explain key XFEL observations, including the apparent loss of Ox upon peroxide formation and the largely unchanged Mn4&#9472;O5 distance from S&#8324; to the peroxide intermediate. Here, we apply density functional theory to remodel the S4 &#8594; S0 transition within the low oxidation state (LOS) paradigm and show that this model yields results more consistent with the XFEL observations. Notably, this study demonstrates that the LOS paradigm can support the formation of an oxyl radical species essential for O&#9472;O coupling and subsequent O2 generation, a capability previously thought to be exclusive to the HOS model. Our findings offer an alternative explanation that complements existing models and broadens our understanding of the OEC mechanism.

         <title>Enhancing Proton Reaction Chemistry of Aqueous Zn&#9472;MnO2 Battery by Phosphate Proton Reservoir</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZPH as a proton reservoir enhances MnO&#8322; cathode performance in aqueous Zn&#9472;MnO&#8322; batteries. ZPH optimizes proton reaction chemistry, enabling high rate performance (219.2&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;&#185; at 3&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;&#185;), specific capacity (347.3&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;&#185; at 0.1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;&#185;), and cycling stability (1500 cycles at 2&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;&#185;). This scalable strategy improves proton&#8208;involved reaction dynamics for grid&#8208;scale energy storage.








Abstract
Aqueous rechargeable Zn&#9472;MnO&#8322; batteries have emerged as promising candidates for grid&#8208;scale energy storage due to their low cost, high safety, natural abundance, and high working potential. However, their widespread application is hindered by rapid capacity degradation and sluggish reaction kinetics. In this study, we introduce Zn&#8323;(PO&#8324;)&#8322; 4H&#8322;O (ZPH) as a proton reservoir to significantly enhance the electrochemical performance of MnO&#8322; by optimizing proton reaction chemistry. Specifically, ZPH stores protons during charging and releases them during discharging, creating a localized H&#8314;&#8208;rich environment that facilitates proton intercalation of Mn&#8308;&#8314;/Mn3&#8314; and the two&#8208;electron transfer reaction of Mn&#8308;+/Mn2&#8314;. Leveraging the proton storage capability of ZPH, the layered MnO&#8322; cathode demonstrates exceptional rate performance (219.2&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;&#185; at 3&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;&#185;), high specific capacity (347.3&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;&#185; at 0.1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;&#185;), and remarkable cycling performance (1500 cycles at 2&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;&#185;). This work provides a scalable and electrolyte&#8208;compatible pathway to optimize proton&#8208;involved reaction dynamics in aqueous Zn&#9472;MnO&#8322; batteries.

         <title>On the Importance of Balancing the pKa of the Additive in &#946;&#8208;Ketoenamine COF Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#946;&#8208;ketoenamine COFs are usually synthesized in the presence of acetic acid. Here, we report the surprising role of organobases TEA and DIPEA in achieving TpPa with high Brunauer&#8208;Emmett&#8208;Teller&#160;surface areas (&gt;1400 m2/g) and high crystallinity. The similar pKa values of TEA and DIPEA (10.8 and 11.0, resp.) and Tp (10.8) mark the importance of balancing the pKa for high&#8208;quality &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine COFs.








Abstract
Due to the irreversible tautomerization of imine linkages to their corresponding ketoenamines, &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) are a stable type of COF that displays high surface areas. In the solvothermal synthesis of such COFs, the use of (acetic) acid is ubiquitous. However, the effect of the added acid on the COF properties (notably their surface area) has never been investigated. Building on an extensive literature overview, we systematically studied the effect of the pKa of several added acids on COF performance characteristics and extended the investigation by including a series of (organo&#8208;)bases with varying pKa. Interestingly, the highest BET surface areas, above 1400 m2/g, were found in the alkaline region of the pKa window, with a maximum near pKa &#8764;10.8 for triethylamine (TEA) and N,N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA). Considering the pKa values related to the three phenolic hydroxyl groups of 2,4,6&#8208;triformylphloroglucinol, one of the COF building blocks, these organobases fully deprotonate two of these hydroxyl groups and partly deprotonate the third one, which optimizes the reaction rate of the &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine bond formation, explaining the improved COF crystallinity and associated microporosity. The largely overlooked use of organobases in the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked COFs thus offers a promising approach to improve the COF performance.

&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values related to the three phenolic hydroxyl groups of 2,4,6-triformylphloroglucinol, one of the COF building blocks, these organobases fully deprotonate two of these hydroxyl groups and partly deprotonate the third one, which optimizes the reaction rate of the &#946;-ketoenamine bond formation, explaining the improved COF crystallinity and associated microporosity. The largely overlooked use of organobases in the synthesis of &#946;-ketoenamine-linked COFs thus offers a promising approach to improve the COF performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electronic and Magnetic Properties of Ferrous Iron in a True Square&#8208;Planar Molecular Environment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin Hamiltonian parameters of an iron(II) phthalocyanine are obtained by pNMR, THz&#8208;EPR, and quantum chemical calculations. Large zero field splitting and the peculiar g&#8208;tensor pattern originate from mixing of the 3A2g ground state with two 3Eg&#8208;excited states of almost the same energy. This forms the basis for correlations between magnetism, structure, and reactivity of iron in this important coordination environment.








Abstract
The electronic and magnetic properties of ferrous iron in the iron(II)&#8208;2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24&#8208;octakis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenoxy)phthalocyanine (FePcOAr), exhibiting a true square&#8208;planar molecular environment, are investigated. Inhibition of intermolecular interactions by steric substituents allows detailed investigation of the electronic structure arising from the planar geometry of the d6 electron configuration. Complementary magnetometry, M&#246;ssbauer, FD&#8208;FT THz&#8208;EPR (frequency&#8208;domain Fourier&#8208;transform terahertz electron paramagnetic resonance) and pNMR (nuclear magnetic resonance of paramagnetic molecules) spectroscopies show that FePcOAr has an S&#160;=&#160;1 ground state with large positive axial zero&#8208;field splitting (ZFS) and a strongly anisotropic g&#8208;tensor, with two g&#8208;values much larger than the free electron g&#8208;value and one smaller. Correlation between the magnetic properties and the electronic structure is provided by high&#8208;level quantum chemical calculations. The calculations indicate a nearly triply degenerate ground level, in which spin&#8208;orbit coupling mixes the isolated 3A2g ground state with two excited 3Eg states, whose energy gaps to the ground state are almost identical. These findings provide valuable insights in the electronic structure of iron phthalocyanines and the long&#8208;standing discussion on their true electronic ground level, which has important implications for the application of this important class of complexes in catalysis and magnetic materials.

         <title>Structural Engineering of 1D Porphyrin&#8208;Crbazole Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a rational 1D COF design strategy through building&#8208;block engineering, revealing how structural topology and charge separation govern photocatalytic performance. Optimized H2Por&#8208;Ph&#8208;CZ achieves superior photocatalytic activity in both oxidative amine coupling and &#945;&#8208;bromoacetophenone dehalogenation via enhanced surface area and charge transfer efficiency.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with 1D architectures hold great potential for photocatalysis but face challenges in rational structural design and charge transfer optimization. Herein, we report a series of 1D porphyrin (Por)&#8208;carbazole (CZ)&#8208;based COFs (MPor&#8208;Phn&#8208;CZ; M&#160;=&#160;H2, Zn; n&#160;=&#160;0, 1) constructed via symmetry&#8208;guided Schiff&#8208;base condensation. The integration of a phenyl spacer (Ph) and metal&#8208;free Por knots in H2Por&#8208;Ph&#8208;CZ enabled an eclipsed AA stacking mode, yielding enhanced crystallinity, a high specific surface area, and optimal donor&#8211;acceptor interactions. Systematic optoelectronic characterization revealed that H2Por&#8208;Ph&#8208;CZ exhibited superior visible&#8208;light absorption, minimized charge recombination, and directional electron transfer from CZ donors to Por acceptors, as validated by DFT calculations. These attributes endowed H2Por&#8208;Ph&#8208;CZ with exceptional photocatalytic activity in both the oxidative coupling of amines and reductive dehalogenation of &#945;&#8208;bromoacetophenone derivatives, outperforming Zn&#8208;incorporated and spacer&#8208;free analogs. This work establishes a design paradigm for 1D COFs through synergistic topology control and electronic modulation, advancing their application in sustainable organic synthesis.

         <title>Valence Electron Dependent Contraction of P6 Ring in [(CpM)2(&#956;,&#951;6:&#951;6&#8208;P6)] (M&#160;&#9552;&#160;V, Mo): A DFT Study</title>

         <dc:description>
VEC dictates the reactivity and extent of NHC&#8208;induced ring contraction in triple&#8208;decker (TD) complexes: 28 VEC leads to the contraction of P6 to a P&#8325; ring, whereas 26 VEC results in further contraction to a P&#8324; middle deck, facilitated by outer&#8208;sphere electron transfer.








Abstract
The P6 ring in [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;,&#951;6:&#951;6&#8208;P6)] contracts to the P5 complex [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;,&#951;5:&#951;5&#8208;P5)][(MeNHC)2P] by MeNHC. In contrast, P6 ring in [(Cp*V)2(&#956;,&#951;6:&#951;6&#8208;P6)] contracts to P5 and P4 complexes [(Cp*V)2(&#956;,&#951;5:&#951;5&#8208;P5)][(MeNHC)2P] and [(Cp*V)2(&#956;,&#951;4:&#951;4&#8208;P4MeNHC)]. In addition, an anionic form of the precursor [(Cp*V)2(&#956;,&#951;6:&#951;6&#8208;P6)][(MeNHC)2P] is also produced here. Mechanistic investigation using TPSSh&#8208;d4/Def2&#8208;TZVP method shows the importance of different spin states in the reaction and a possible outer sphere electron transfer aiding the ring contraction of P5 to P4. Valence electron count (VEC) determines the variety of spin states accessible to the complexes and plays a decisive role in deciding the fate of the middle deck.

         <title>Supercritical CO2&#8208;Induced Ferromagnetism in 2D C3N4 for Catalysis in Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D ferromagnetic amorphous carbon nitride (a&#8208;C3N4) was successfully synthesized via supercritical CO2 treatment. The 2D ferromagnetic amorphous C3N4 substrate tuned the spin charge density of the loading Ru nanoparticles and accelerated the electrocatalytic HER kinetics.








Abstract
The exploration of highly efficient catalysts has been an essential challenge for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, 2D amorphous carbon nitride (a&#8208;C3N4) with obvious ferromagnetism was achieved through a typical supercritical CO2 (SC CO2) treatment process. The experimental results revealed the structural and chemical transformations during the formation of a&#8208;C3N4. Subsequently, a&#8208;C3N4 anchored with Ru nanoparticles (Ru/a&#8208;C3N4) was successfully synthesized and employed as a catalyst for the electrocatalytic HER, exhibiting a significantly enhanced catalytic performance compared to Ru nanoparticles anchored on 2D graphitized carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) without SC CO2 treatment. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further demonstrate that the ferromagnetic g&#8208;C3N4 substrate not only promotes disassociation of water molecules under alkaline conditions but also influences the charge distribution and modulates the free energy of H adsorption, finally accelerating the HER kinetics. These results impart significant insights into the electrocatalytic HER process and establish a foundation for the design of advanced catalysts with enhanced performance for energy conversion and storage applications.

Subsequently, a-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; anchored with Ru nanoparticles (Ru/a-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) was successfully synthesized and employed as a catalyst for the electrocatalytic HER, exhibiting a significantly enhanced catalytic performance compared to Ru nanoparticles anchored on 2D graphitized carbon nitride (g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) without SC CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; treatment. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further demonstrate that the ferromagnetic g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; substrate not only promotes disassociation of water molecules under alkaline conditions but also influences the charge distribution and modulates the free energy of H adsorption, finally accelerating the HER kinetics. These results impart significant insights into the electrocatalytic HER process and establish a foundation for the design of advanced catalysts with enhanced performance for energy conversion and storage applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multifunctional Organelle&#8208;Targeting Probes for Intracellular Imaging and Enhanced Cancer Phototherapy</title>

Cy&#8208;NBD&#8208;5F was synthesized as a responsive photodynamic theranostic agent, featuring GSH&#8208;activated fluorescence signaling and enhanced Type&#8208;I&amp;II PDT for effective cancer treatment. After reacting with GSH, the active compound (Cy&#8208;OH&#8208;5F) successfully provides NIR emission and induces cancer cell death under light irradiation. In addition, the dual&#8208;organelle&#8208;targeting ability of this molecule could benefit the efficient therapeutic effects.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) represents a promising modality for cancer treatment; however, its clinical application is hindered by challenges such as glutathione (GSH)&#8208;mediated quenching of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and autofluorescence interference during visible light imaging. This study introduces Cy&#8208;NBD&#8208;5F, a photosensitizer engineered to address these limitations. Upon activation by GSH, Cy&#8208;NBD&#8208;5F exhibits 5.5&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement at 701&#160;nm, producing its reduced form, Cy&#8208;OH&#8208;5F, which demonstrates enhanced ROS generation, including a 1.4&#8208;fold increase in singlet oxygen and 1.2&#8208;fold increase in superoxide anion radicals. Under light irradiation, Cy&#8208;OH&#8208;5F induces significant cytotoxicity (IC50&#160;&lt;&#160;3 &#181;M). Additionally, the molecule predominantly localizes within lysosomes and the endoplasmic reticulum, showing organelle&#8208;specific effects to improve therapeutic efficacy. These findings show the potential of Cy&#8208;NBD&#8208;5F as a precise and effective tool for cancer theranostics.

         <title>A Tour in the Chemistry of a Tricoordinate Rh(&#8722;I) Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The low&#8208;coordinated Rh(&#8722;I) complex displays a nonconventional reactivity, affording a Rh(I) compound in a trigonal&#8208;pyramidal geometry, a rare true metalloradical Rh(0) complex, a highly unsaturated 14 eV complex featuring a Rh&#160;&#8722;&#160;Si bond, and catalyzes a dimerization of aldehydes to the ester through a Rh(&#8208;I)/Rh(I) catalytic cycle with catalyst deactivation to an allylrhodium complex.








Abstract
The finding of the unprecedented 16&#8208;e tricoordinate planar rhodium(&#8722;&#921;) complex, K[Rh(IPr)(dvtms)] (K[1]) (IPr&#160;=&#160;1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolyl&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene, dvtms&#160;=&#160;divinyltretramethyldisiloxane) prompted us to explore its reactivity. K[1] reacts as a nucleophile with methyliodide to give [Rh(IPr)(dvtms)Me], a Rh(&#921;) compound with an exceptional trigonal&#8208;pyramidal structure. Other haloalkanes abstract one electron from K[1] to give the previously reported [Rh0(IPr)(dvtms)] complex. K[1] also reacts with protonic acids and weak proton sources such as water and ketones to eventually give the rare tricoordinate 14&#8208;electron complex [RhI(IPr)(SiMe2OSiMe2CH&#160;=&#160;CH2)] with a Rh&#160;&#8722;Si bond. The 16&#8208;electron complex [RhI(IPr)(SiMe2OSiMe2CH&#160;=&#160;CH2)(H2C&#160;=&#160;CH2)] was characterized as an intermediate in this reaction. Furthermore, K[1] runs up to five cycles of catalytic condensation of nonenolizable aldehydes to esters, such as p&#8208;tolylaldehyde, before being fully converted into the inactive complex Rh(IPr)(&#951;3&#8208;C3H4ptolyl)(C2H4)] with fragmentation of the diolefin dvtms. Computational studies have provided valuable insights into the reactivity patterns and behavior of this complex, including those of the rhodium(&#8722;I)/rhodium(I) catalytic cycle.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Mediated Il&#8208;8 Binding to Heparan Sulfate Evaluated by Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy</title>

EIS demonstrates the effect of metal ion mediation of sulfation pattern and uronic acid stereochemistry&#8208;dependent IL&#8208;8 binding.








Abstract
Heparan sulfate (HS) interactions with interleukin 8 (IL&#8208;8) are crucial for immune system response. The structural features of the HS and the environmental entities, such as metal ions, can regulate these interactions. However, it is challenging to evaluate the effect of each parameter on the interactions because of low accessibility to well&#8208;defined saccharides and the lack of characteristic features to be determined by analytical tools. We evaluated the effect of the HS structural features on IL&#8208;8 binding affinity utilizing electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). We showed that the metal ions Ca2+ and Mg2+ dissimilarly mediate the interactions of HS and IL&#8208;8 in structure&#8208;dependent manner of the HS. We showed that in all glycans, a positive synergistic effect on IL&#8208;8 binding was observed. For several glycans, the presence of ions resulted in a dramatic increase in the affinity to IL&#8208;8, while for other glycans, a milder effect was observed. This demonstrated that both structural motifs and environmental features are crucial for maintaining the interactions between the HS and IL&#8208;8.

         <title>Accelerating or Slowing: Fine Tuning the De&#8208;Threading Kinetics of a T&#8208;Shaped Benzimidazolium Pumping Cassette</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of T&#8208;shaped benzimidazole&#8208;based dumbbell threads with variable stopper sizes, in combination with crown ether wheels, to elucidate the influence of structural parameters on [2]pseudorotaxane stability and de&#8208;threading kinetics. These findings establish key design principles for tailoring energy landscapes in benzimidazole&#8208;based molecular pumps.








Abstract
Artificial molecular machines (AMMs) rely on precise control of molecular motion, often enabled by mechanically interpenetrated architectures such as pseudorotaxanes. Here, we systematically investigated a library of [2]pseudorotaxanes formed by the combination of T&#8208;shaped benzimidazolium threads featuring variable stopper sizes and crown ether wheels (24C6, B24C6, and 23C6), to elucidate how structural parameters govern [2]pseudorotaxane stability and de&#8208;threading kinetics. Using ring&#8208;closing metathesis and subsequent hydrogenation, we synthesized 10 neutral [2]pseudorotaxanes in high yields (76&#8211;87%). Kinetic studies in DMSO&#8208;d&#8326; at 338&#160;K revealed that de&#8208;threading half&#8208;lives (t&#8321;/&#8322;) span five orders of magnitude, from 0.237&#160;hours (3a&#8315;, &#916;G&#8225; = 24.63&#160;kcal/mol) to 436&#160;hours (5c&#8315;, &#916;G&#8225; = 31.87&#160;kcal/mol). Notably, stopper enlargement and macrocycle rigidification (eg., via B24C6) significantly suppressed de&#8208;threading rates; 4d&#8315;, bearing a benzylic phenyl stopper and B24C6, showed a &#916;G&#8225; of 29.04&#160;kcal/mol and a t&#8321;/&#8322; of 168&#160;hours. Gas&#8208;phase modeling and NMR analyses further elucidated the roles of stopper geometry and host&#8211;guest interactions in modulating energy barriers. These findings provide design principles for the construction of pseudorotaxane&#8208;based modules, paving the way for programmable molecular pumps and advanced AMMs.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8225;&lt;/sup&gt; = 24.63&#160;kcal/mol) to 436&#160;hours (&lt;b&gt;5c&lt;/b&gt;&#8315;, &#916;&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8225;&lt;/sup&gt; = 31.87&#160;kcal/mol). Notably, stopper enlargement and macrocycle rigidification (eg., via &lt;b&gt;B24C6&lt;/b&gt;) significantly suppressed de-threading rates; &lt;b&gt;4d&lt;/b&gt;&#8315;, bearing a benzylic phenyl stopper and &lt;b&gt;B24C6&lt;/b&gt;, showed a &#916;&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8225;&lt;/sup&gt; of 29.04&#160;kcal/mol and a &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;&#8321;&lt;sub&gt;/&lt;/sub&gt;&#8322; of 168&#160;hours. Gas-phase modeling and NMR analyses further elucidated the roles of stopper geometry and host&#8211;guest interactions in modulating energy barriers. These findings provide design principles for the construction of pseudorotaxane-based modules, paving the way for programmable molecular pumps and advanced AMMs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>3,4,5&#8208;Trifluorophenyldiazonium&#8211;A Unique Radical Source for the Visible Light Induced, Catalyst&#8208;Free Arylation of Tyrosine Residues in Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By exploiting the unique properties of 3,4,5&#8208;trifluorophenyldiazonium salts in combination with phenols, radical arylations of tyrosine units in peptide substrates could for the first time be achieved under highly attractive conditions requiring only visible light irradiation and neither photocatalysts nor other additives, pre&#8208;functionalization, or protecting groups.








Abstract
The direct radical arylation of tyrosine residues in peptides has been achieved under highly attractive conditions, requiring only the peptide substrate, a 3,4,5&#8208;trifluorophenyldiazonium salt, and irradiation with visible light. Being well&#8208;balanced in its reactivity to form strong charge&#8208;transfer complexes with the phenolic side chain, which are required for initiation and aryl radical formation, the trifluoro substitution still shows sufficient stability toward nucleophilic aromatic substitution in aqueous solution. Besides allowing selective arylation, the introduction of the 3,4,5&#8208;trifluorophenyl unit enables further functionalization as well as potential applications in NMR and MRT studies.

         <title>Quasiracemic Crystallization of Luminescent Chiral Molecules: Mechanochromic Luminescence and Sign Inversion of Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The arrangement of molecules plays a crucial role in governing the luminescent properties of organic crystals. While quasiracemic crystallization, based on the co&#8208;crystallization of two structurally similar but non&#8208;identical enantiomeric molecules, offers a promising strategy for organizing distinct species within a single crystal, its potential for tuning luminescent behavior remains largely unexplored. Herein, we have prepared quasiracemic crystals from a pair of enantiomeric binaphthyl derivatives functionalized with either ethynylnaphthalene or ethynylbenzothiadiazole groups. The molecular arrangement of the quasiracemic crystal is analogous to that of the racemic ethynylnaphthalene derivative, whereas the quasiracemic crystals exhibit mechanochromic luminescence (MCL) behavior similar to that of the racemic ethynylbenzothiadiazole derivative. Notably, the quasiracemic crystals exhibit circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), and the CPL sign is inverted relative to that of the enantiopure crystal of the ethynylbenzothiadiazole derivative. These results highlight quasiracemic crystallization as a new strategy for modulating MCL and CPL properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Small Cations for Engineering 3D Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Within the last 15 years 3D hybrid perovskites made a breakthrough in the development of new semiconducting materials for diverse applications. This concept article addresses several critical questions central to the development and understanding of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) hybrid perovskites. Specifically, it explores: (1) which organic cations are currently known to stabilize 3D perovskite structures; (2) the potential for discovering and utilizing new cations to support these structures; (3) the influence of the organic cation on physical, chemical, and optoelectronic properties of 3D hybrid perovskites; and (4) whether ongoing research should focus on the synthesis of novel 3D perovskites with alternative small organic cations. By examining these questions, this article aims to provide insights into the structural versatility, property optimization, and future directions for this rapidly evolving field, while also critically evaluating the feasibility and value of expanding the library of organic cations for 3D hybrid perovskite materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Chloride Selective, Non&#8208;protonophoric Ion Transport with Macrocyclic Halogen Bonding Anionophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic ion transporters hold promise as both chemical probes and potential therapeutics for diseases linked to malfunctioning protein ion transporters. However, their application in biological systems is limited, partly due to the cytotoxicity arising from unselective ion transport. Here, we demonstrate that highly active and selective anionophores can be accessed by combining halogen bonding anion recognition with macrocyclic anion encapsulation. Anion transport experiments in large unilamellar vesicles revealed over 300&#8208;fold selectivity for chloride transport over proton/hydroxide ions, which is key for potential future therapeutic applications, where the dissipation of cellular pH gradients must be avoided. The mechanism underpinning selectivity is studied through Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and MD simulations at the membrane interface, demonstrating that the cyclic structure imposes an energetic preference for chloride binding over hydroxide, as well as a greater desolvation of hydroxide, which further disfavours its transport. We anticipate that these results will accelerate the transition towards the use of artificial chloride transport in biology.</dc:description>

         <title>Reassessing the Possibility of &#960;&#8211;&#963;&#8211;&#960; Full Electron Delocalization through 3D Aromatic Carboranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over the past few decades, considerable attention has been devoted to exploring the electronic interactions of various substituents with 3D aromatic carboranes. In the case of substituents possessing available p&#8208;orbitals, conjugation between the &#960;&#8208;system and the &#963;&#8208;framework of the carborane is possible via negative hyperconjugation, where electron density from a filled &#960;&#8208;orbital overlaps with an adjacent &#963;* orbital. However, this is inherently a local effect, which was further bolstered by the fact that aromatic conjugation between planar (2D) &#960;&#8208;systems and the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) aromatic carborane cage does not exist. Nevertheless, recent studies have raised the intriguing possibility that 3D aromatic carboranes may function as &#963;&#8208;conjugated bridges, enabling electronic communication between spatially separated &#960;&#8208;systems. Herein, we investigated the potential conjugation of various substituents with or through carborane systems to better understand the nature of the possible interaction. We demonstrated that significant delocalization through the carborane cluster can be achieved only in the case of radical systems; however, this type of interaction is not a unique feature of carboranes, as similar behavior can also be observed in saturated hydrocarbons.</dc:description>

         <title>Zinc(II) Monomeric, Dimeric and Trimeric Photosensitizers with Microsecond&#8208;lived Intra&#8208;Ligand Charge Transfer Excited States Investigated through Time&#8208;resolved Optical and X&#8208;ray Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>ZnII photosensitizers relative to CuI complexes have received less attention due to their energetically&#8208;higher metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer states. Three ZnII complexes namely a Monomer, a bimetallic helicate and a trimetallic helicate, bearing phenanthroline ligands are hereby studied through time&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray absorption (tr&#8208;XAS) and femto&#8208;microsecond optical transient absorption spectroscopy (OTA). The formation of intraligand singlet charge transfer (IILCT) excited states is achieved within femtoseconds, followed by intersystem crossing (ISC) in nanoseconds to generate microsecond&#8208;lived triplet (3ILCT) states. Femtosecond OTA shows that the 1ILCT states in the Monomer, Dimer and Trimer occur within 235 fs, 683 fs and 730 fs, respectively, while &#160;nano&#8208;microsecond OTA and tr&#8208;XAS show their 3ILCT states &#160;to decay within 1.00 &#181;s, 1.48 &#181;s and 1.51 &#181;s. The ISC from the 1ILCT to the 3ILCT state for the Trimer is 42.8 ns compared to the Monomer and Dimer with ISC rates less than 13 ns. These differences arise due to the stabilization by &#960;&#8208;&#960; and CH&#8208;&#960; non&#8208;covalent interactions of the phenanthroline ligands. The dihedral and torsional angles indicate stronger ligand strains in the excited states of the Dimer and Trimer vs the Monomer. DFT calculations for the electrochemical oxidation potentials further highlight their capability in inducing&#160;photoredox processes.</dc:description>

Femtosecond OTA shows that the 1ILCT states in the Monomer, Dimer and Trimer occur within 235 fs, 683 fs and 730 fs, respectively, while &#160;nano-microsecond OTA and tr-XAS show their 3ILCT states &#160;to decay within 1.00 &#181;s, 1.48 &#181;s and 1.51 &#181;s. The ISC from the 1ILCT to the 3ILCT state for the Trimer is 42.8 ns compared to the Monomer and Dimer with ISC rates less than 13 ns. These differences arise due to the stabilization by &#960;-&#960; and CH-&#960; non-covalent interactions of the phenanthroline ligands. The dihedral and torsional angles indicate stronger ligand strains in the excited states of the Dimer and Trimer vs the Monomer. DFT calculations for the electrochemical oxidation potentials further highlight their capability in inducing&#160;photoredox processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Influence of Sequence Structure of Donor/Acceptor&#8208;Containing Segment on Crystallization&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Assembly Behavior and Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA) has emerged as a facile strategy to generate donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) &#960;&#8208;conjugated nanofibers with potential applications from photocatalysis to nanomedicine. However, the reports on CDSA of D&#8208;A &#960;&#8208;conjugated&#8208;polymer&#8208;based block copolymers (BCPs) are rather rare. In this context, we report two types of BCPs containing the same corona&#8208;forming poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) segment, but different core&#8208;forming D&#8208;A &#960;&#8208;conjugated blocks, one of which (BT&#8208;OPE5&#8208;BT) contains an OPE5 segment flanked by two electron&#8208;deficient benzothiadiazole (BT) unit and another one of which (B&#8208;alt&#8208;BT) contains four phenylene (B) units and three BT units placed in an alternate way. The BT&#8208;OPE5&#8208;BT&#8208;based seed micelles were not kinetically frozen with obvious micellar dissolution at room temperature, whereas almost no micellar dissolution occurred for B&#8208;alt&#8208;BT&#8208;based seed micelles. However, only polydisperse fiber&#8208;like micelles can be formed by self&#8208;seeding approach owing to presence of multiple packing modes for B&#8208;alt&#8208;BT&#8208;b&#8208;PNIPAM36 over the micellar elongation. The B&#8208;alt&#8208;BT exhibited much more pronounced intra/intermolecular charge transfer effect than BT&#8208;OPE5&#8208;BT, and thus the micelles of B&#8208;alt&#8208;BT&#8208;b&#8208;PNIPAM36 exhibited about 50 nm red&#8208;shift in UV/vis absorption band than that of BT&#8208;OPE5&#8208;BT&#8208;b&#8208;PNIPAM36 and appealing photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activities. This work highlights the importance of sequence structure of D/A units of D&#8208;A segments on both CDSA behavior and photophysical/chemical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>The Ascent of Supramolecular Polymers and Gels in Asymmetric Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymers and gels, formed by the spontaneous assemblies of small molecules through various types of non&#8208;covalent interactions, are attractive materials for many applications. Their modularity also offers many opportunities in asymmetric catalysis, that have been tackled in the last two decades and more intensively in the last one. In this review, strategies adopted to develop efficient asymmetric catalysts supported on supramolecular polymers and gels are first categorized according to the chiral or achiral nature of the monomers used for their construction and second to their ability to be commuted into different states. Catalytic supramolecular polymers have been described for which enantioselectivity stems mostly from the molecular chirality located next to the reactive group, or at opposite ends of the spectrum, exclusively from the chiral environment provided by the supramolecular helices. New paradigms revealed by these systems include: (i) the organization of catalytic sites at the periphery of modular and well&#8208;structured one&#8208;dimensional assemblies, (ii) the possibility to conduct asymmetric reactions with a sub&#8208;catalytic amount of chiral inducers and even in absence of chiral monomers, and (iii) the development of a new class of switchable asymmetric catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Sustainable Approaches for the Protection and Deprotection of Functional Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While functional group tolerance is a critical consideration in synthetic method development, many functional groups often fail to remain intact under diverse reaction conditions. Therefore, the protection of specific functional groups and subsequent deprotection are convenient choices for the efficient and selective synthesis of target compounds, of which the strategies have been securely established. Meanwhile, the development of sustainable synthetic methods, particularly electrochemistry and photochemistry, has recently played a significant role in the field of organic synthesis, and these approaches have proven useful in the methods of functional group protection and deprotection. This review explores electrochemical and photochemical strategies for the protection and deprotection of functional groups, with a focus on their mechanistic diversity, sustainability, and synthetic utility across various functional group classes.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailored Watson&#8211;Crick Pairing Partners for Xanthosine in RNA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The deamination of guanosine nucleobases results in the formation of xanthosine (X)&#8208;containing RNA. This process formally resembles adenine deamination (A&#8208;to&#8208;I editing). The biological significance and basic chemical consequences of X&#8208;modified RNA are poorly understood. In this study, we examine xanthosine interactions with tailored pyrimidine nucleobases. We synthesized RNAs that provide either the 2,4&#8208;diaminopyrimidine C&#8208;nucleoside kappa (K) or 2iminocytidine (2imC) as an "ideal" tridendate Watson&#8208;Crick pairing partner. For K&#8208;modified RNA, we used a phosphoramidite previously introduced for RNA solid&#8208;phase synthesis. For 2imC&#8208;modified RNA, we developed access via synthetic 2&#8208;thiocytidine (2sC)&#8208;modified RNA, followed by osmium tetroxide (OsO4)&#8208;ammonium chloride (NH4Cl)&#8208;mediated transformation into 2imC&#8208;modified RNA. RNAs with K&#8211;X or 2imC&#8211;X base pairs indeed showed stable duplex formation with significantly higher melting temperatures than X&#8211;C or X&#8211;U containing RNAs and higher still than A&#8211;U or G&#8211;U containing RNA references. Furthermore, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallographic structure analysis confirmed the tridendate Watson&#8208;Crick pair geometry of K&#8211;X within an RNA double helix. Our findings suggest that K&#8211;X and 2imC&#8211;X pairs could be used in RNA decoding processes, thereby expanding the RNA genetic alphabet. However, their potential for use in biochemical and cellular applications remains to be seen.</dc:description>

         <title>Vinylene&#8208;Linked Fully Conjugated 3D Covalent Organic Polymers for Photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel vinylene&#8208;linked fully conjugated 3D covalent organic polymers (COPs) were synthesized. Both materials showed efficient photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation, where the thiophene&#8208;enriched COP outperformed than that of the benzene&#8208;modified counterpart, highlighting the critical role of thiophene units in enhancing catalytic activity.








Abstract
Covalent organic polymers (COPs), featuring conjugated architectures, high porosity, and structural tenability, have emerged as promising candidates for photocatalytic applications. However, the design and synthesis of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) sp2&#8208;carbon&#8208;conjugated COPs, along with their photocatalytic performances, remain underexplored. Here, we synthesized two novel vinylene&#8208;linked fully conjugated 3D COPs (BUCT&#8208;COP&#8208;50 and BUCT&#8208;COP&#8208;51) through the saddle&#8208;shaped building blocks. Under visible&#8208;light irradiation, both materials demonstrated efficient hydrogen peroxide&#160;(H2O2) generation, with BUCT&#8208;COP&#8208;51 (thiophene&#8208;enriched) achieving a remarkable production rate of 3.21&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in pure water, higher than BUCT&#8208;COP&#8208;50 (benzene&#8208;modified, 2.16&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). Mechanistic investigations revealed that the H2O2 generation predominantly proceeded via the indirect two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction pathway. The superior performance for BUCT&#8208;COP&#8208;51 could attributed to its narrower bandgap, broader light absorption range, and higher conductivity. This work illustrates that vinylene linked fully conjugated 3D COPs could be as promising semiconductors in environmental and energy&#8208;related fields.

&lt;p&gt;Two novel vinylene-linked fully conjugated 3D covalent organic polymers (COPs) were synthesized. Both materials showed efficient photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) generation, where the thiophene-enriched COP outperformed than that of the benzene-modified counterpart, highlighting the critical role of thiophene units in enhancing catalytic activity.

         <title>Kinetically Arrested SERS&#8208;Active Aggregates for Biosensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three chemically benign components (AuNP, CB[7] and PEG&#8208;SH) are employed to produce highly&#8208;stable SERS&#8208;active AuNP aggregates able to detect (bio)analytes at low concentrations in high salinity and protein&#8208;containing media. Tunable disassembly is embedded in the AuNP aggregate design, which can be triggered by endogenous thiol&#8208;containing&#160;compounds.








Abstract
There is great demand for biosensors capable of long&#8208;term, non&#8208;invasive monitoring of low analyte concentrations in various biofluids for diagnostics, personalized healthcare, and disease monitoring. However, biofluids present several challenges to biosensor sensing and stability on account of their complex composition and dynamic nature. Surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) offers ultra&#8208;high sensitivity, non&#8208;destructive, real&#8208;time monitoring, and non&#8208;invasive detection, ideal for sensing in complex media. Plasmonic gold nanoparticle (AuNP) SERS&#8208;active assemblies have been widely explored owning to their biocompatibility and tunable sensitivity based on AuNP morphology. Here, we employ thiolated poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG&#8208;SH) to produce kinetically trapped metastable AuNP:cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) aggregates containing robust nanogaps (ca. 1&#160;nm), which have previously displayed strong, reproducible SERS signals at low concentrations. The AuNP:CB[7]:PEG aggregates maintain strong SERS&#8208;activity, demonstrating low concentration detection of a model Raman reporter and a bioanalyte in a range of biofluids. Moreover, the aggregates are highly tunable through facile modification of the PEG&#8208;SH chain length and grafting density and possess an encoded disassembly mechanism within their design highlighting the potential application of these aggregates for non&#8208;invasive in vivo long&#8208;term monitoring alongside future customized SERS biosensing&#160;applications.

         <title>A Diverse Array of Catalytic Photoredox Reactions Based on Aluminum(III)&#8208;Salen Complexes: Understanding the Enhancement of Catalytic Activity via Amine Association</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since aluminum is an earth&#8208;abundant and environmentally benign main&#8208;group metal, the development of aluminum&#8208;complex&#8208;based photoredox catalysts remains a significant issue. Herein, we report aluminum(III)&#8208;salen complexes (Al&#8208;salens) as versatile photoredox catalysts. The combination of an Al&#8208;salen catalyst with an amine under visible&#8208;light irradiation allowed the hydrodechlorinative transformations of aryl chlorides, the reductive coupling of carbonyl compounds, and the defluoroallylation of perfluoroalkylarenes. Mechanistic studies using transient absorption spectroscopy suggested that the Al&#8208;salen complex associates with the amine via its vacant site to improve the reducing ability of its excited&#8208;state. After electron transfer between the excited state of the Al&#8208;salen/amine complex and an appropriate oxidant, the generated aminium radical cation is leveraged to achieve the oxidative transformations of amines, such as &#945;&#8208;arylation and &#945;&#8208;cyanation. The diversity of the catalytic photoredox reactions based on Al&#8208;salen complexes is comparable to that of heavy&#8208;precious&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Enhancement Mechanisms of Lithium&#8208;Ion Storage in Black Phosphorus@Ti3C2Tx(BP@Ti3C2Tx) Composite Thin&#8208;Film Electrodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A binder&#8208;free&#160;BP@Ti3C2Tx&#160;composite thin&#8208;film electrode was fabricated via a one&#8208;step vacuum filtration method, enabling precise control over morphology and scalability. The Ti3C2Tx&#160;MXene framework constructs a 3D conductive network that enhances charge transfer kinetics and mechanically confines black phosphorus (BP) particles through robust Ti&#8208;O&#8208;P bonding, effectively suppressing BP&#8217;s volume expansion during cycling. Structural characterization (XRD, SEM, EDS, etc.) confirms the homogeneous "Mosaic" architecture, with BP particles uniformly embedded in&#160;the MXene matrix. XPS analysis further reveals enhanced&#160;Ti&#8208;C bonding and significant&#160;Ti&#8208;O&#8208;P interfacial interactions. Electrochemical evaluation demonstrates&#160;exceptional performance: the composite electrode achieves a discharge capacity of 685.92 mAh/g at 0.1 A/g after 100 cycles, near&#8208;100% Coulombic efficiency, and remarkable capacity recovery (783.21 mAh/g) after high&#8208;rate cycling (1.5 A/g). Kinetic analysis via cyclic voltammetry further indicates a reduced polarization (&#916;V = 0.06 V) and enhanced capacitive contribution (b&#8208;value = 0.663&#8208;0.799), attributed to MXene&#8217;s dual role in facilitating ion diffusion and electron transport.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactions of Pacman phosphanes (1a) with Lewis acids such as R3B (R = C6H5, C6F5) and GaCl3 was investigated. While equilibria between mono&#8208; and di&#8208;adducts were found in the reaction with BPh3, B(C6F5)3 preferentially formed the di&#8208;adduct (1a&#183;2B(C6F5)3), which could be isolated and fully characterized. DFT calculations showed that the N&#8208;bonded adducts are thermodynamically more stable than the P&#8208;bonded adducts. In contrast to the reaction of the Pacman phosphane with boranes, GaCl3 reacted with 1a to give an unusual [Pacman&#8208;GaCl2]+[GaCl4]&#8211; salt, featuring a nearly planar GaN2C2 heterocycle as part of the Pacman macrocycle. In addition, the coordination geometry on one P atom changes from triple to an unusual quadruple coordination, although it is still a formal P atom in the +III oxidation state, as shown by quantum chemical calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Macrocyclic Arenes with Expanded Cavities from Seven&#8208;Membered&#8208;Ring&#8208;Fused Monomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocyclic arenes exhibit host&#8211;guest properties, but their internal cavities are often limited by unit rotation. To overcome this, we synthesized macrocyclic arenes from seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring&#8208;fused monomers, achieving expanded and stable cavities. Cavity volume calculations confirmed significant cavity expansion, and NMR studies demonstrated enhanced guest encapsulation ability.








Abstract
Numerous macrocyclic arenes have been synthesized from various types of aromatic monomers. However, the rotation of monomer units often reduces the internal cavity volume. To address this issue, seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring&#8208;fused monomers were employed for the synthesis of macrocyclic arenes. The fusion of aromatic units via seven&#8208;membered rings introduces a bent geometry into the macrocyclic framework, which reduces conformational flexibility and helps preserve a stable and expanded internal cavity in both solution and solid states.

To overcome this, we synthesized macrocyclic arenes from seven-membered-ring-fused monomers, achieving expanded and stable cavities. Cavity volume calculations confirmed significant cavity expansion, and NMR studies demonstrated enhanced guest encapsulation ability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numerous macrocyclic arenes have been synthesized from various types of aromatic monomers. However, the rotation of monomer units often reduces the internal cavity volume. To address this issue, seven-membered-ring-fused monomers were employed for the synthesis of macrocyclic arenes. The fusion of aromatic units via seven-membered rings introduces a bent geometry into the macrocyclic framework, which reduces conformational flexibility and helps preserve a stable and expanded internal cavity in both solution and solid states.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Epoxy Resin Patterns Prepared Based on the Photochromism of a Cholesteric Liquid Crystal Mixture</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochromic CLCs were prepared using a nematic epoxy liquid crystal and a photoisomerizable chiral dopant. Based on the photochromic property, colorful epoxy resin patterns were prepared, which were suitably applied for decoration and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.








Abstract
Cholesteric liquid crystal polymer network (CLCN) patterns based on polyacrylate have attracted much attention for the applications in decoration and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Although epoxy resin&#8208;based CLCN patterns can be prepared using thermochromic cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs), it is hard to prepare them on a large scale on coating lines. Herein, a photochromic CLC mixture was prepared using a reactive epoxy liquid crystal and a photoisomerizable chiral dopant. Driven by the photoisomerization of the chiral dopant, the selective Bragg reflection band of the CLC mixture redshifted with increasing the 365&#8208;nm UV light irradiation time. Due to the high viscosity of the CLC mixture, the reflection band of the irradiated CLC mixture was both time&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent. After photopolymerization, the structural color was fixed. By precisely controlling the annealing time after the photoisomerization of the chiral dopant or the irradiation time for photoisomerization, colorful epoxy resin patterns were prepared, which have potential applications in decoration and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Radical Hydro&#8208;Ethoxycarbonyldifluoromethylation of Alkenes with BrCF2CO2Et</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Considering the unique properties of the CF&#8322; group and the potential for further transformations of the CO&#8322;Et component in the CF&#8322;CO&#8322;Et moiety, along with the necessity of synthesizing an alkane containing a CF&#8322;CO&#8322;Et unit for the production of the pharmaceutical lubiprostone, there has been growing interest in developing efficient methods to incorporate CF&#8322;CO&#8322;Et into alkanes. This research presents a mild, versatile, and efficient radical hydro&#8208;ethoxycarbonyldifluoromethylation process using BrCF&#8322;CO&#8322;Et. The method is applicable to both unactivated alkyl alkenes and active aryl alkenes. It stands out due to its mild reaction conditions, the lack of requirement for expensive reagents, and the absence of transition metals, offering significant advantages over previously reported techniques.








Abstract
The difluoromethylene (CF&#8322;) group, valued for its unique electronic and steric properties, plays a critical role in pharmaceutical and agrochemical design, as exemplified by drugs like lubiprostone, which requires ethyl 2,2&#8208;difluorohexanoate as a key intermediate for its synthesis. Consequently, developing efficient methods to incorporate the ethoxycarbonyldifluoromethyl group into alkanes is highly desirable. Herein, we describe a mild, versatile, and efficient radical hydro&#8208;ethoxycarbonyldifluoromethylation of alkenes with BrCF2CO2Et. This process is applicable to both unactivated alkyl alkenes and active aryl alkenes. The protocol is characterized by mild reaction conditions, the absence of expensive reagents, and the elimination of transition metals.

         <title>A supramolecular system of bioactive ionic liquid, peony extract, and peptide for enhanced permeability and synergistic skincare benefits</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The growing demand for safe and sustainable cosmetics has led to a marked inclination toward natural extracts and peptides as raw materials. In this study, we developed a sustainable system with multiple anti&#8208;aging effects by combining peony extract (PE) and acetyl hexapeptide&#8208;8 (AHP8) to simultaneously treat static and dynamic wrinkles, as well as skin dullness. As the poor skin permeability of AHP8 limited its efficacy, we used a bioactive ionic liquid derived from betaine and malic acid ([Bet][MA]) as a permeation enhancer. In vitro and in vivo zebrafish experiments indicated that [Bet][MA] not only significantly enhances transdermal and cellular penetration but also exerts synergistic anti&#8208;aging effects. While being biosafe, [Bet][MA] significantly increased the transdermal permeation, skin retention, and cellular uptake of AHP8. Theoretical calculations revealed that [Bet][MA] improved the anti&#8208;wrinkle and whitening efficacies of AHP8 and PE through supramolecular interactions; it modulated their electron cloud distribution and molecular polarity and thus intensified their affinity to target proteins in aqueous solutions. The supramolecular PE/AHP8/[Bet][MA] system demonstrated excellent radical&#8208; and reactive oxygen species&#8208;scavenging capability, collagen production, and tissue repair capability while concurrently inhibiting tyrosinase activity, motion signaling, and inflammation. The study findings pave the way for sustainable and multifunctional skincare solutions.</dc:description>

         <title>Convergent Approach Toward ADP&#8208;Ribosylated Peptides via a Chemoselective Phosphate Condensation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research presents a convergent approach for synthesizing well&#8208;defined ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides. It involves a regio&#8208; and chemoselective condensation of phosphoadenosyl (ADPr) fragments with phosphoribosyl peptides, allowing for the creation of various ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides, including a di&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated&#8208;peptide as the first example of a synthetic oligo&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptide.








Abstract
The preparation of well&#8208;defined ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides is essential for studying the functional implications of this post&#8208;translational modification. While methodologies exist for the chemical synthesis of short oligo&#8208;ADPr fragments and mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides separately, combining the two distinct chemistries, required to assemble them, has remained challenging. In this research, we employ a methodology for the regio&#8208; and chemoselective condensation of two phosphomonoesters to convergently install the pyrophosphate bond in ADP&#8208;ribosylated constructs. A diverse set of phosphoribosylated peptides, varying in the amino acid acceptor, was prepared and condensed with adenosine monophosphate to yield mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides. Furthermore, a solid&#8208;phase approach was developed to access a phosphoadenosyl&#8208;ADPr fragment, which was used to prepare a di&#8208;ADPr&#8208;peptide as the first example of a synthetic oligo&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptide. Overall, the work presented here extends synthetic methodology for the preparation of well&#8208;defined ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We employed a systematic quantum chemistry&#8208;based computational approach for simulating chiral HPLC, incorporating high&#8208;level DFT methods. For the popular polysaccharide&#8208;based CSPs, 90%$\%$ of determined elution orders were computed correctly. 








Abstract
We assess the capability of modern quantum chemical methods to simulate enantioseparation on chiral stationary phases (CSPs) in high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) by comparing calculated and experimental elution orders (EEOs). Compared to previous studies, this work utilizes more accurate state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art density functional theory (DFT) methods combined with automated computational workflows. The proposed approach employs molecular docking, conformer sampling, and DFT refinement for final ensemble&#8208;based association free energy calculations of two diastereomeric complexes. Ten drug&#8208;type molecules were considered on two common CSPs for which various molecular models were investigated. Although the association free energies of the strongest binding motifs were rather system&#8208;dependen t ranging from about &#8722;9 to 29&#160;kcal/mol, the differences between the two enantiomers were always only a few kcal/mol, sometimes even below 1&#160;kcal/mol. Despite these small differences, correct determination of EEOs for all tested cyclodextrin&#8208;based CSP systems was achieved. Even for more flexible polysaccharide&#8208;based CSPs, the workflow yielded correct EEO results in 90%$\%$ of the tested cases, provided that a sufficiently large cut&#8208;out of the CSP material consisting of about 150 atoms was considered as a model. Due to the latter constraint, the method remains computationally expensive, requiring further research for improving practical application in, e.g., screening&#160;studies.

         <title>The&#160;Molecular Properties of Honey Bee Acetylcholinesterase Reveal Opportunities to Avoid Off&#8208;Target Effects in Insecticide Discovery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure, dynamics, and kinetics of the essential enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) of honey bee have been studied and compared to AChEs in mosquitoes and mammalians. Profiling of the active sites with selected substrates and AChE inhibitors revealed dramatic differences between the species. Molecular modelling identified key arene&#8211;arene interactions unique for honey bee AChE, important for monitoring off&#8208;target effects in the development of AChE&#8208;targeting pesticides used in agriculture and for mosquito control.








Abstract
Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) regulates nerve signalling and is a well&#8208;validated target for insect control in both agriculture and the prevention of mosquito&#8208;borne diseases. However, current AChE&#8208;targeting insecticides are nonspecific and thus also affect other organisms such as honey bees. The synaptic AChE of honey bees (AChE2) is encoded by the ace&#8208;2 gene, thought to have originated from a gene duplication of ace&#8208;1. Here, we analyse the structure, dynamics, and kinetics of AChE2 enzymes from the honey bee, Apis mellifera (AmAChE2), and the malaria mosquito, Anopheles gambiae (AgAChE2), and compare them to the more extensively studied type 1 mosquito AChE (AgAChE1) and mammalian AChEs. Important differences between these AChE subtypes were identified. Profiling with selected noncovalent AChE inhibitors revealed strong AChE2 inhibitors, but the inhibition profiles of AChE2 differed substantially from those for AgAChE1 and human AChE. Modelling of AChE2&#8226;inhibitor complexes revealed two tyrosines unique to AChE2 that are responsible for these differences in inhibitor sensitivity. These results highlight the importance of considering molecular properties of AChE2 when developing AChE1 inhibitors for pest control. Furthermore, the results also suggest that including AChE2 in computer&#8208;aided molecular design efforts during the discovery process could be very valuable for reducing risks of off&#8208;target effects.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Induced Structural Rearrangement in an M8L2 Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electron&#8208;rich ligand, based on the so&#8208;called exTTF moiety, self&#8208;assembles with a bimetallic ruthenium complex to provide an M8L2 architecture, where the two ligands adopt a perpendicular orientation. Thanks to the unique electronic and geometric features of the exTTF core, this discrete structure undergoes a structural transformation into a new M8Lox2 species upon oxidation, in which both dicationic ligands rotate in a face&#8208;to&#8208;face fashion, yielding a cage&#8208;like structure.








Abstract
Due to the reversible nature of the metal&#8211;ligand bond, coordination cages are inherently dynamic architectures which can undergo structural transformations upon appropriate external stimulations. This adaptability has been widely explored in various fields. Herein, we report the preparation of a redox&#8208;responsive discrete (Ru2)4L2 architecture through a coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly approach, where Ru2 is a bis(ruthenium(II)) complex and L a tetrapyridyl ligand. Importantly, ligand L is designed around the &#960;&#8208;extended tetrathiafulvalene framework (exTTF), whose geometry is highly sensitive to its redox state. The resulting (Ru2)4L2 assembly was fully characterized, revealing a twisted configuration with two orthogonally oriented L units in close spatial proximity. Remarkably, this assembly undergoes an oxidation&#8208;induced transformation into a (Ru2)4Lox&#8322; structure, in which the two dicationic ligands are now spatially separated and aligned according to a face&#8208;to&#8208;face arrangement, affording a cage&#8208;like structure. This reorganization is driven by the redox&#8208;induced geometric and electronic changes of the exTTF cores and the resulting electrostatic repulsions occurring between both oxidized ligands. The process is fully reversible upon chemical reduction, restoring the original (Ru2)4L&#8322; structure.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Folding of Azobenzene Derivatives with Axial Chirality and Chirality Inversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Featuring an azobenzene core with chiral amino acid arms, this system uses photo&#8208;isomerization to drive reversible folding. The trans&#8208;form is stabilized via intramolecular CH&#8211;&#960; interactions, while the cis&#8208;form relies on amide N&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O hydrogen bonds. This light&#8208;induced structural switching enables reversible manipulation of chiroptical properties and the emergence of axial chirality, demonstrating chirality transportation.








Abstract
Understanding of photoisomerism effect on the chiral transportation occurred intra&#8208; and intermolecularly shall facilitates the fabrication of smart chiroptical materials for sensing, recognition, and display. Here we present the photoisomerization&#8208;enabled molecular folding and chirality transportation. Azobenzene core is conjugated with two chiral arms comprising of amino acid segments. The substituted position including ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;positioned substituents affects the formation of intramolecular interactions, leading to distinct adaptiveness toward the solvent media. The trans&#8208;cis isomerism of azobenzene allows for the reversible manipulation of chiroptical properties, accompanied by the appearance of axial chirality. The ortho&#8208;substituted azobenzene can form folded structures stabilized by intramolecular CH&#8211;&#960; interactions in trans&#8208;form, while in the cis&#8208;form, the conformation is stabilized by the hydrogen bonds between the oxygen atom and the hydrogen attached to the nitrogen in the amide segment. Structural transformations induced by solvent and light irradiation were revealed through density&#8208;functional theory (DFT)&#8208;based computational studies and experimental results. This work unveils the photoisomerization effect on folding, and achieves reversible conformational changes and chirality inversion, showing potential for constructing advanced smart chiroptical materials.

         <title>N,N&#8208;Bis(trifluoromethyl)aminoacetonitrile: A Versatile Building Block for the Introduction of the Bis(trifluoromethyl)amino Group</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N,N&#8208;Bis(trifluoromethyl)aminoacetonitrile (CF3)2NCH2CN, which is readily accessible, is established as a versatile starting compound for the synthesis of various types of (CF3)2N&#8208;containing building blocks, that is, N&#8208;heterocycles, alkenes, and acid derivatives such as N,N&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)glycine. The degradation of (CF3)2N derivatives in strong acidic and basic media at elevated temperatures to result in nonpersistent compounds is highlighted.








Abstract
N,N&#8208;Bis(trifluoromethyl)aminoacetonitrile (CF3)2NCH2CN (1) that is accessible via a simple single&#8208;step protocol is established as a building block for the introduction of the (CF3)2N group. The two reaction sites of 1, the methylene unit and the nitrile (cyano) group, provide access to different organic substance classes. This includes alkenes via Knoevenagel condensations, and N&#8208;heterocycles and acid derivatives obtained by addition reactions to the nitrile unit. These new (CF3)2N derivatives are potential building blocks containing the bis(trifluoromethyl)amino group. Deprotonation of 1 at the methylene group highlights the electron&#8208;withdrawing nature of the (CF3)2N group. The {(CF3)2NCHCN}&#8722; anion (1&#8722;) is characterized by NMR spectroscopy and its reaction with [Ph3PAuCl] results in [Ph3PAuCH{N(CF3)2}(CN)] (Au1) and [(Ph3PAu)2C{N(CF3)2}(CN)] (Au21). Crystal structure analysis of (CF3)2NCH2CN (1), Au21, and almost all alkenes, N&#8208;heterocycles, and acid derivatives with a (CF3)2N group combined with spectroscopic data and results from DFT calculations provide insight into properties of the highly fluorinated (CF3)2N substituent. Especially the ability of the amino nitrogen atom to participate in weak hydrogen bonding, albeit its low basicity, is of relevance.

The two reaction sites of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, the methylene unit and the nitrile (cyano) group, provide access to different organic substance classes. This includes alkenes via Knoevenagel condensations, and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocycles and acid derivatives obtained by addition reactions to the nitrile unit. These new (CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N derivatives are potential building blocks containing the bis(trifluoromethyl)amino group.

         <title>Ar&#8211;X Coupling Reactions of Cationic Aryl Copper(II) Complexes with Organic Substrates: What Role Do Radicals Play?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One of the simplest cationic copper(II) aryl complexes with a bidentate chelating ligand, [(phen)Cu(Ph)]+, has been prepared in the gas phase via three routes: transmetalation, desulfination and decarboxylation. The bimolecular reactivity of this organocopper(II) cation towards a range of organic substrates showcases versatile C&#8211;H, C&#8211;C, C&#8211;I, and C&#8211;S bond formation pathways, some of which involve formation of radicals.








Abstract
Copper(II) aryl species are proposed intermediates in copper catalysed C&#8208;X coupling reactions. Here, the formation and reactions of the cationic copper complexes [(phen)Cu(Ar)]+ (phen&#160;=&#160;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline; Ar&#160;=&#160;Ph, p&#8208;MeC6H4, p&#8208;MeOC6H4, p&#8208;MeCOC6H4) are explored in the gas&#8208;phase using electrospray ionisation (ESI) multistage mass spectrometry (MSn) experiments in a linear ion trap mass spectrometer together with Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. A survey of three routes to the preparation of [(phen)Cu(Ph)]+ showed that transmetalation of [(phen)3Cu][BPh4]+ and desulfination of [(phen)Cu(O2SPh)]+ both produced the desired complex [(phen)Cu(Ph)]+, but decarboxylation of [(phen)Cu(O2CPh)]+ gave a higher yield with fewer competing side reactions, making it the preferred route to the other aryl complexes [(phen)Cu(Ar)]+. The aryl complexes [(phen)Cu(Ar)]+ undergo protonolysis reactions with formic acid to yield a formate complex [(phen)Cu(O2CH)]+; react with N,N&#8242;&#8208;diisopropylcarbodiimide to form an adduct, likely by insertion to give [(phen)Cu((NiPr)2CAr)]+; undergo C&#8211;S bond&#8208;forming reactions with dimethyl disulfide; and react with allyl iodide by Ar&#8211;I bond&#8208;forming reactions in preference to Ar&#8211;allyl bond cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The potential reaction mechanisms associated with the different reaction pathways were explored by DFT calculations.

         <title>Amine&#8208;AlH3 Adducts as Energetic Materials for a New Generation of Solid Fuels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Energetic materials, mainly in the forms of propellants, explosives, and pyrotechnics, are crucial in various civilian applications, such as fuels for rockets and spacecraft. Current energetic fuels rely on highly toxic and polluting ammonium perchlorate (AP) or carcinogenic hydrazine derivatives, encouraging the search for greener and safer substitutes. This work demonstrates the first use of amine&#8209;AlH3 adducts as potential solid fuels with promising hypergolic properties and high energy content. The herein presented four amine&#8208;AlH3 adducts, AlH3 coordinated with quinuclidine (Quin), triethylenediamine (TEDA), hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) and tetraazatricyclododecane (TATD), illustrate a unique strategy to create new solid fuels by combing AlH3 with an energy&#8208;rich nitrogen&#8208;containing molecule. The crystal structures of new compounds ([HMTA&#8209;AlH3]n and [TATD&#8209;AlH3]n) are determined from powder X&#8208;ray diffraction data. Differential scanning calorimetry&#8209;thermogravimetric analysis (DSC&#8209;TGA) of the samples combined with mass spectrometry (MS) evidences high thermal stability. The ultrashort ignition delays as low as one&#160;ms show an excellent hypergolic response. Four amine&#8208;AlH3 adducts have higher combustion heat (&gt;&#160;29&#160;kJ&#160;g&#8208;1) than conventional hydrazine fuels (19.5&#160;kJ&#160;g&#8208;1). Finally, the successful mechanochemical syntheses of Quin2AlH3 and [HMTA&#8209;AlH3]n is introduced, showcasing a green chemistry approach to high energy materials</dc:description>

         <title>Structural and Optical Modification of Siloxene Nanosheets Driven by Selenium Doping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Siloxene nanosheets are produced by topotactic deintercalation of a purified CaSi&#8322; phase and subsequently doped with selenium through thermal evaporation. Structural and spectroscopic analyses confirm dopant integration while preserving the 2D framework. This modification reduces the optical bandgap of siloxene from 2.62 to 1.79&#160;eV, enhancing the material's performance for sensing, optoelectronics, and catalysis.








Abstract
2D nanomaterials have emerged as highly promising candidates for next&#8208;generation technologies due to their exceptional electronic and optical properties. Among these, siloxene nanosheets have garnered significant interest for their structural versatility, facile synthesis, and intrinsic semiconducting behavior. In this study, we explore selenium doping as a strategy to modulate the optoelectronic properties of siloxene. Silicon nanosheets were synthesized via the topochemical deintercalation of a purified CaSi&#8322; phase, followed by selenium incorporation through thermal evaporation. Comprehensive structural and spectroscopic analyses confirm the successful integration of selenium atoms while preserving the 2D framework of the nanosheets. Notably, selenium doping induces a pronounced bandgap narrowing, offering a viable pathway for tuning the electronic and optical characteristics of siloxene. These findings expand the potential of silicon&#8208;based 2D materials for high&#8208;performance applications in sensing, optoelectronics, and catalysis, paving the way for their integration into advanced technological platforms.

         <title>Influence of the Substitution Pattern of Terpene&#8208;Based Seven&#8208;Membered Lactones on Yttrium&#8208;Mediated Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization: A Kinetic and Mechanistic Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
(&#8208;)&#8208;Menthide and trans (+)&#8208;carvomenthide, differing only in substitution pattern, were polymerized via ROP using a bis(phenolate) yttrium catalyst. Kinetic studies showed faster polymerization of (+)&#8208;carvomenthide but greater control with (&#8208;)&#8208;menthide. Experimental and DFT analyses revealed mechanistic differences in chain propagation, highlighting how molecular structure influences reactivity and polymerization control.








Abstract
Terpenes exhibit a wide range of structures, thus enabling diverse applications. Herein, (&#8208;)&#8208;menthide and trans (+)&#8208;carvomenthide were synthesized from terpenoids (&#8208;)&#8208;menthone and (+)&#8208;dihydrocarvone, differing solely in their substitution pattern. (&#8208;)&#8208;Menthide features a methyl group at position 4 and an isopropyl group at position 7, whereas (+)&#8208;carvomenthide shows the inverse arrangement. Both lactones were transformed into polyesters via ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) using an amino&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;bis(phenolate) yttrium catalyst. Polymerization kinetics revealed first&#8208;order behavior, with (+)&#8208;carvomenthide polymerizing significantly faster than (&#8208;)&#8208;menthide, while (&#8208;)&#8208;menthide demonstrated a more controlled polymerization. Activation energies were 36.3&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 for (+)&#8208;carvomenthide and 40.8&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 for (&#8208;)&#8208;menthide. The Gibbs free energy of activation confirmed the lower energy barrier for (+)&#8208;carvomenthide polymerization, with experimental values of 81.9&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 compared to 89.1&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 for (&#8208;)&#8208;menthide. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations supported the experimental results, with computed Gibbs free energy barriers of 84.5&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 for trans (+)&#8208;carvomenthide and 82.3&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 for (&#8208;)&#8208;menthide and mechanistic differences. Refined free energy barriers were determined to be 102.1&#160;kJ mol&#8315;1 for (&#8208;)&#8208;menthide and 84.9&#160;kJ mol&#8315;1 for trans (+)&#8208;carvomenthide, agreeing with the experimental trend. These findings highlight the critical role of molecular structure and substituent position on polymerization kinetics and energy barriers in metal&#8208;catalyzed polymerization.

&lt;p&gt;(-)-Menthide and &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; (+)-carvomenthide, differing only in substitution pattern, were polymerized via ROP using a bis(phenolate) yttrium catalyst. Kinetic studies showed faster polymerization of (+)-carvomenthide but greater control with (-)-menthide.

         <title>TAILORING SELF&#8208;ASSEMBLED PEPTIDE HYDROGELS WITH ANTIMICROBIAL OR CELL ADHESIVE PROPERTIES FOR TISSUE ENGINEERING</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bacterial colonization on biomaterials is a major issue, leading to approximately 20% of implant failures due to infection and biofilm formation. To address this, peptide&#8208;based hydrogels incorporating tailored bioactive peptides have emerged as promising candidates for applications in tissue engineering and infection control. Here, we have designed peptide sequences that incorporate i) a self&#8208;assembling unit, and ii) bioactive motifs, including the well&#8208;known RGD sequence to promote cell adhesion, or an antimicrobial peptide derived from lactoferrin (LF) to exhibit antibacterial properties. To aid in the gelation, these peptides were combined with hyaluronic acid, rendering peptide&#8208;based hydrogels without the need for additional external assembly triggers, simplifying their application in biomedical contexts. This protocol allowed for a spontaneous formation of a three&#8208;dimensional fibrillar network, with structural and physicochemical properties suitable for tissue engineering. The biological evaluation revealed the ability of RGD&#8208;based hydrogels to increase the adhesion and spreading of osteoblastic cells compared to controls; while the LF&#8208;based hydrogels significantly reduced the viability and attachment of both Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative strains, clearly affecting bacterial morphology. This report demonstrates the feasibility of this technology to produce hydrogels incorporating distinct biological cues, highlighting their potential as versatile biomaterials to address diverse biomedical challenges.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Photophysical, and Chemiexcitation Properties of Luminol&#8208;Fullerene Dyads: Towards Chemiexcitation Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fullerene&#8208;based donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) dyads have been extensively studied for their unique electronic properties, with applications in photoinduced energy conversion devices. In these systems, dynamic quenching of the excited donor&#8217;s emission occurs, via energy or electron transfer to the fullerene acceptor. However, there are no reports on fullerene dyads bearing chemiluminescent donor analogues. In this context, the synthesis of two luminol&#8208;fullerene D&#8208;A dyads, bridged with alkyl chains of different lengths, is reported herein. The electronic communication between the two moieties was thoroughly evaluated, following either the photo&#8208; or chemi&#8208;excitation of the linked units. Steady state and time&#8208;resolved absorption studies, combined with emission techniques, were employed to monitor the deactivation fate of excited species. In general, a significant quenching of the excited luminol&#8208;derived emission signals was observed, revealing detectable intramolecular interactions between the two moieties. Unlike what is usually observed in other luminol&#8208;based D&#8208;A systems, quenching of the excited species generated upon photo&#8208; and chemi&#8208;excitation of the luminol&#8208;fullerene dyads is attributed to electron rather than energy transfer. This was found to be consistent with the estimated Gibbs energy of photoinduced electron transfer and with DFT theoretical calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Coverage&#8208; and Temperature&#8208;Dependent Rates of Metalation, Ring Fusion and Polymerization of Benzoporphyrins on Cu(111)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using scanning&#8208;tunneling microscopy (STM), temperature&#8208;programmed desorption (TPD), X&#8208;ray photo&#173;electron spectroscopy (XPS) and density&#8208;functional theory (DFT), we have investigated metalation, ring fusion and polymerization of three different benzoporphyrins, tetraphenyl&#173;trans&#173;disbenzoporphyrin (2&#8208;Benzo), copper&#8208;tetraphenyltransdibenzo&#173;porphy&#173;rin (Cu 2&#8208;Benzo) and tetra&#173;phenyl&#173;&#173;tetra&#173;benzo&#173;porphyrin (4&#8208;Benzo), from 280 to 1000 K on Cu(111), and compare with previous data of tetraphenylporphyrin (0&#8208;Benzo) on Cu(111).
Using STM, we observe 2&#8208;Benzo to adsorb as individual, rather&#8208;immobile molecules at room tempe&#173;rature, which coalesce into elongated islands of metalated molecules at 373 K. N 1s XPS spectra confirm the metalation, and DFT&#8208;calculated structures and simulated STM images confirm the appearance in STM. Upon further heating to 398 K, the islands become rough and irregularly shaped, before completely dissolving at 423 K, most likely related to intramolecular ring fusion. Heating to 950 K leads to complete polymerization and a rough structure on the surface.
Using H2 TPD, we follow the coverage&#8208;dependent rates of metalation, ring fusion and polymerization for all four molecules. The metalation rate is found to correlate with, sometimes abrupt, changes in the adsorption structures, whereas the rates of ring fusion and polymerization decrease gradually with increasing coverage, for all molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Competition between Photoswitching and Fluorescence in Hemiindigos and Hemithioindigos</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of functionalized HIs and hemithioindigos (HTIs) were synthesized and studied for their potential applications as IFPSs. The investigation revealed that ortho&#8208;OH&#8208;substituted derivatives exhibit high fluorescence quantum yields while concurrently retaining significant photoswitching capabilities, high photostability, and fast recovery.








Abstract
Intrinsically fluorescent photoswitches (IFPSs) are crucial for super&#8208;resolution microscopy techniques. This study explores the impact of substituents on fluorescence and photoswitching efficiency in hemiindigos (HIs) and hemithioindigos. A series of functionalized derivatives &#160;was synthesized by one&#8208;step Knoevenagel condensations using a sustainable mechanochemical approach and characterized across various environments. Ortho&#8208;OH&#8208;substituted hemiindigo derivatives exhibited high fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;FL&#160;=&#160;0.65) while retaining significant photoswitching capabilities (&#934;Z&#8594;E&#160;=&#160;0.29 in THF) and fast recovery. These enhanced properties are attributed to the &#960;&#8208;electron&#8208;donating characteristics of the OH substituents and the presence of intramolecular hydrogen bonds. The results of CC2 ab initio calculations revealed a detailed photoswitching mechanism: (1) initial population of the fluorescent &#960;&#960;* singlet excited state minimum, (2) subsequent elongation of the C&#9552;O bond leading to depopulation of the &#960;&#960;* state to the n&#960;* excited state minimum, (3) twisting of the double bond within the n&#960;* state, and (4) relaxation to the ground electronic state via a conical intersection. The analysis of the potential&#8208;energy surfaces modulated by EDG substituents, both in the &#960;&#960;* and n&#960;* excited states, provides insights into the structure&#8208;property relationships of IFPSs, guiding future rational design.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Photochemistry in Resonant Acoustic Mixers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bringing light to solid&#8208;state photochemistry &#8211; We introduce the first photochemical reaction using a resonant acoustic mixer (RAM), eliminating the need for milling media. This innovative, solvent&#8208;free approach enables scalable photochemistry under UVC light. Therefore, we designed and compared two custom&#8208;made photoreactors, paving the way for greener, more efficient photochemical reactions.








Abstract
Herein, we developed the first photochemical reaction set&#8208;up under solid&#8208;state conditions using a resonant acoustic mixer (RAM), a novel mechanochemical methodology that eliminates the need for milling media. This innovation outscores previous approaches in the ball mill under avoidance of milling balls and their related disadvantages. Further, it enables the facile performance and upscaling of photochemical reactions up to a factor of 10. We investigate the influences of liquid and solid additives on the rheology and performance of two model reactions and demonstrate and compare the efficiency and applicability of two custom&#8208;designed photoreactors.

         <title>Fluorenyl Cations: Synthesis and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review covers the history of fluorenyl cations from Deno&#8217;s first report in 1954 on the parent fluorenyl cation to the present. The parent cation and most derivatives have only been observed as a fleeting species by mass spectrometry, UV/Vis spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, or NMR spectroscopy. The most common synthetic routes to fluorenyl cations are by dihydroxylation and halide abstraction of substituted fluorenyl precursors. Over the 71 year history, many advancements have been made with recent developments leading to isolable species including two characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction. The scope of this review covers the field of fluorenyl cations in addition to related species with different aromatic groups in place of benzene fused to the cycopentadienyl core.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamics of Ligand and Guest in 1D Hg(II)&#8208;Bispidine Coordination Polymers with Different Topologies Investigated by Solid&#8208;State NMR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1D coordination polymers (CPs) made of parallel, weakly interacting chains have been recently proposed for the selective adsorption of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), one of the main sources of air and water pollution. Since the efficiency of adsorption for VOC removal strongly depends on the specific and stable interactions between the volatile species and the CP framework, the characterization at the atomic level of host&#8208;guest interactions and guest dynamics is of particular interest. Here, low&#8208; and high&#8208;resolution solid&#8208;state NMR experiments were applied to acquire information on ligand and guest dynamics for two 1D CPs (1&#8208;ClBz and 2&#8208;ClBz), both containing a bispidine organic ligand, Hg(II) as metal center, and chlorobenzene trapped within the framework, but featuring different topologies. By combining analyses of on resonance 1H free induction decays, 1H and 13C longitudinal relaxation times, and 2H quadrupole echo spectra, it was found that chlorobenzene undergoes fast dynamics, mainly isotropic, in 1&#8208;ClBz, while it shows slower anisotropic motions in 2&#8208;ClBz, indicating stronger interactions between framework and adsorbate in the latter associated to the lower available free volume. Ligands are quite rigid for both CPs in the investigated frequency scale, apart from methyl groups, which undergo fast motions about their ternary symmetry axes.</dc:description>

         <title>Computational Study on the Relationship between Charge Localization and Second Hyperpolarizability in Mixed&#8208;Valence Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular systems with symmetric resonance structures with invertible polarization (SRIP) have been reported to exhibit negative second hyperpolarizability, which is unusual for ordinal molecular systems. We herein report that mixed&#8208;valance systems can also be recognized as SRIP systems showing negative second hyperpolarizability. Since electronic structures of MV systems are often represented by the Robin&#8211;Day classification, we theoretically investigated the correlation between the Robin&#8211;Day class and second hyperpolarizability &#947; in simple MV systems such as He2&#183;+ and biaryl derivatives. We found that the absolute value of &#947; increases and its sign reverses near the boundary of the Robin&#8211;Day class&#8208;III and II, where the charge begins to localize. The significant validation of &#947; was rationalized by the context of the intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) transitions, which are unique to MV systems. The calculated &#947; for MV systems is more than 100 times larger in absolute value than in the neutral state near the charge localization boundary, and the sign of &#947; switches at the class&#8208;II/III boundary. These results suggest that the nonlinear optical response of materials can be significantly switched by redox stimuli.</dc:description>
