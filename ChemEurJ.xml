         <title>Chiral Atropisomeric&#8208;NHC Catechodithiolate Ruthenium Complexes for Z&#8208;Selective Asymmetric Ring&#8208;Opening Cross Metathesis of Exo&#8208;Norbornenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A set of 16 chiral ruthenium complexes containing atropisomerically stable N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) ligands was synthesized from prochiral NHC precursors. After a rapid screening in asymmetric ring&#8208;opening&#8208;cross metathesis (AROCM), the most effective chiral  atrop BIAN&#8208;NHC Ru&#8208;catalyst (up to 97:3 er) was then converted to a Z&#8208;selective catechodithiolate complex. The latter proved to be highly efficient in Z&#8208;selective AROCM of exo&#8208;norbornenes affording valuable trans&#8208;cyclopentanes with excellent Z&#8208;selectivity (&gt;98%) and high enantioselectivity (up to 96.5:3.5 er).</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Unprecedented &#945;/&#946;&#8208;Alternate (1&#8594;4)&#8208;Glucans via Stereoselective Iterative Glycosylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glucans are major biomaterials on the earth, with &#945;&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;glucans (i.e., amylose) and &#946;&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;glucans (i.e., cellulose) being the most abundant ones, which are relevant to energy storage and structural function, respectively. Interestingly, (1&#8594;4)&#8208;glucans with alternate &#945;/&#946;&#8208;linkages, namely herewith amycellulose, have never been disclosed in nature. Here we report a robust glycosylation protocol for the stereoselective construction of the 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;&#945;&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;glucosidic linkages, which employs an optimal combination of glycosyl N&#8208;phenyltrifluoroacetimidates as donors, TMSNTf2 as promoter, CH2Cl2/nitrile or CH2Cl2/THF as solvents. A broad substrate scope has been demonstrated by coupling five imidate donors with eight glycosyl acceptors, in which most of the glycosylations lead to high yield and exclusively 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;&#945;&#8208; or 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;selectivity. Applying this glycosylation protocol and with an iterative manner, the unprecedented &#945;/&#946;&#8208;alternate (1&#8594;4)&#8208;glucans up to a 16&#8208;mer have been synthesized. Differently from amylose, that adopts a compact helicoidal arrangement, the synthetic amycellulose features an extended ribbon&#8208;like conformation, comparable to the extended shape of cellulose.</dc:description>

         <title>Trapping of a Transient Base&#8208;Stabilised Alumylene and Alumylene&#8208;type Reactivity of a Self&#8208;Stabilising Dialumene towards Organic Azides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reduction of a carbene&#8208;coordinated, sterically encumbered terphenyl&#8208;substituted aluminium diiodide, (LRAlI2), yielded a "masked" dialumene (LRAl=AlRL), self&#8208;stabilised through [2+2] cycloaddition with a peripheral aromatic group. During the course of the reaction, a carbene&#8208;stabilised arylalumylene (LRAl:) was generated in situ, which was trapped using an alkyne, generating an aluminacyclopropene or a C&#8208;H activated product thereof, depending on the steric bulk of the alkyne. The masked dialumene also underwent intramolecular cycloreversion and dissociation into alumylene fragments, which reacted with various organic azides to yield monomeric or dimeric iminoalanes depending on the sterics of the azide substituent. The thermodynamics of monomeric and dimeric iminoalane formation were probed by theoretical calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Taming the Lewis Superacid Al(ORF)3 (RF=C(CF3)3): DFT Guided Identification of the &#8220;Stable yet Reactive&#8221; Adduct SiPr2&#8594;Al(ORF)3; Its Use as ORF&#8208; Abstractor from a &#8220;Ni&#8208;ORF&#8221; complex.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A DFT study of several L&#8594;Al(ORF)3 (L = Lewis bases) adducts allowed the identification of (iPr2S)&#8594;Al(ORF)3 1&#8209;SiPr  2  as a &#8220;stable yet reactive&#8221; adduct. 1&#8209;SiPr 2  was shown to act as a masked Lewis superacid able to release Al(ORF)3 under mild conditions. It could be used to abstract a ORF&#8208; ligand from (bipyMe2)Ni(ORF)2 (bipyMe2 : 6,6&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;dipyridyl) and generate the nickel alkoxide complex&#160; [(bipyMe2)Ni(ORF)(iPr2S)]+[(RFO)3Al&#8208;F&#8208;Al(ORF)3]&#8208; 5. Ligand exchange of iPr2S by Ph3P yielded [(bipyMe2)Ni(ORF)(PPh3)]+[(RFO)3Al&#8208;F&#8208;Al(ORF)3]&#8208; 6.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Ylide&#8208;functionalized phosphines (YPhos) have recently proven to be strongly donating ligands that enable high catalyst activities in gold(I)&#8208;mediated transformations. We now report on a calorimetric study dealing with the [Au(YPhos)Cl] system and assess YPhos&#8208;Au bond dissociation enthalpies (BDE). Comparison with other commonly used phosphines confirmed the high binding strengths of the YPhos ligands. Furthermore, the values of the reaction enthalpies were shown to correlate with the electronic properties of the ligands measured via the Tolman electronic parameter or the calculated molecular electrostatic potential at phosphorus. Notably, the reaction enthalpies can conveniently be derived by computational methods, thus making these easy&#8208;to&#8208;obtain descriptors for ligand donor property quantification.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deriving diverse compound libraries from a single substrate in high yields remains to be a challenge in cycloparaphenylene chemistry. In here, a strategy for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of shape&#8208;persistent alkyne&#8208;containing cycloparaphenylene has been explored using readily available azides. The copper&#8208;free [3+2]azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition provided high yields (&gt;90%) in a single reaction step. Systematic variation of the azides from electron&#8208;rich to &#8208;deficient shines light on how peripheral substitution influences the characteristics of the resulting adducts. We find that among the most affected properties are the molecular shape, the oxidation potential, excited state features, and affinities towards different fullerenes. Joint experimental and theoretical results are presented including calculations with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art, artificial intelligence&#8208;enhanced quantum mechanical method 1 (AIQM1).</dc:description>

         <title>Regulation of the oxidase mimetic activity of ceria nanoparticles by buffer composition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ceria nanoparticles (CNPs) is an important typical nanozyme with multiple enzyme mimetic activities, which could facilitate the oxidation of organic dyes in acidic conditions, because of the oxidase mimetic activity. Usually, the regulation of oxidase mimetic activity is focused on the adjustment of the structure, morphology, composition, surface, and other factors of nanozymes. However, the influence of the surrounding environment is not considered, which is very important during the reaction process. In this work, the oxidase mimetic activity of CNPs in buffer solutions including citric acid, acetic acid and glycine buffer solutions was investigated, with the results that carboxyl group in buffer solution could adsorb the CNPs on the surface to promote the oxidase mimetic activity. Due to the chelation with cerium ion, the enhancement is more significant by molecules with polycarboxylic groups, and the enhancement is more efficient by carboxyl molecules in buffer solution, compared with the modification of the carboxyl groups on the surface, because of the easier operation and smaller steric hindrance. From viewpoint of increasing the oxidase mimetic activity of CNPs, the work is expected to provide references for the selection of the reaction system to optimize the oxidase mimetic activity in bio&#8208;detection application.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of Potent and Highly Selective Epoxyketone&#8208;Based Plasmodium Proteasome Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Development of epoxyketone&#8208;based proteasome inhibitors with low nanomolar in&#8197;vitro potency for blood&#8208;stage Plasmodium falciparum and low cytotoxicity for human cells. The best inhibitor irreversibly inactivates the &#946;5 subunit of the P.&#8197;falciparum proteasome and contains a hexanoyl group at P4, a D&#8208;amino acid at P3 and a fluorinated aromatic L&#8208;amino acid at P1. This compound represents a novel, potent and selective antimalarial drug lead.







Abstract
Here, we present remarkable epoxyketone&#8208;based proteasome inhibitors with low nanomolar in&#8197;vitro potency for blood&#8208;stage Plasmodium falciparum and low cytotoxicity for human cells. Our best compound has more than 2,000&#8208;fold greater selectivity for erythrocytic&#8208;stage P.&#8197;falciparum over HepG2 and H460 cells, which is largely driven by the accommodation of the parasite proteasome for a D&#8208;amino acid in the P3 position and the preference for a difluorobenzyl group in the P1 position. We isolated the proteasome from P.&#8197;falciparum cell extracts and determined that the best compound is 171&#8208;fold more potent at inhibiting the &#946;5 subunit of P.&#8197;falciparum proteasome when compared to the same subunit of the human constitutive proteasome. These compounds also significantly reduce parasitemia in a P. berghei mouse infection model and prolong survival of animals by an average of 6&#8197;days. The current epoxyketone inhibitors are ideal starting compounds for orally bioavailable anti&#8208;malarial drugs.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Thia&#8208;Michael Addition to &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethylacrylates for 3D Network Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fast and efficient catalyst&#8208;free thia&#8208;Michael addition onto &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethylacrylates is thoroughly studied through experimental kinetic studies and DFT calculations in order to elucidate its mechanism. An application to a swift preparation of a thermoset is also reported.Catalyst&#8208;Free Thia&#8208;Michael Addition to alpha&#8208;Trifluoromethylacrylates for 3D Network Synthesis (Leclerc, Poli, et&#8197;al.)







Abstract
Thia&#8208;Michael additions (1,4&#8208;additions of a thiol to a Michael acceptor) are generally catalyzed by an external Br&#248;nsted or Lewis base. A spontaneous (uncatalyzed) Michael addition of thiols to &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl acrylates is described, as well as its application to the very efficient preparation of a thermoset. A thorough mechanistic investigation, based on an experimental kinetic study and on DFT calculations, is presented for the addition of arene&#8208; and alkanethiols to tert&#8208;butyl trifluoromethyl acrylate in polar aprotic solvents, unveiling a probable solvent&#8208;assisted proton transfer in the rate&#8208;determining step and a considerable lowering of the energy barrier induced by the CF3 group.

         <title>Multifunctional Intrinsically Disordered Regions in Transcription Factors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical features of intrinsically disordered regions in transcription factors that endow them with structural plasticity central to their functions in the nucleus are dissected in this Review. It highlights recent studies that illustrate the involvement of disordered regions in processes such as protein interactions, DNA binding and specificity, chromatin opening, and phase separation.







Abstract
Eukaryotic transcription factors (TFs) are the final integrators of a complex molecular feedback mechanism that interfaces with the genome, consolidating information for transcriptional regulation. TFs consist of both structured DNA&#8208;binding domains and long intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) embedded with motifs linked to transcriptional control. It is now well established that the dynamic multifunctionality of IDRs is the basis for a wide spectrum of TF functions necessary to navigate and regulate the human genome. This review dissects the chemical features of TF IDRs that endow them with structural plasticity that is central to their functions in the nucleus. Sequence analysis of a set of over 1600 human TFs through AlphaFold was used to identify key features of their IDRs. Recent studies were then highlighted to illustrate IDR involvement in processes such as protein interactions, DNA binding and specificity, chromatin opening, and phase separation. To expand our understanding of TF functions, future directions are suggested for integrating experiments and simulations, from in vitro to living systems.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Aldehyde Oxidation by a Tungsten Dependent Aldehyde Oxidoreductase from Aromatoleum Aromaticum</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bacterial W&#8208;dependent enzyme aldehyde oxidoreductase catalyses the oxidation of a broad range of aldehyde to their carboxylic acids driven by electrochemistry at low applied potentials.







Abstract
In contrast to their molybdenum dependent relatives, tungsten enzymes operate at significantly lower redox potentials, and in some cases they can carry out reversible redox transformations of their substrates and products. Still, the electrochemical properties of W enzymes have received much less attention than their Mo relatives. Herein we analyse the tungsten enzyme aldehyde oxidoreductase (AOR) from the mesophilic bacterium Aromatoleum aromaticum which has been immobilised on a glassy carbon working electrode. This generates a functional system that electrochemically oxidises a wide variety of aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes in the presence of the electron transfer mediators benzyl viologen, methylene blue or dichlorophenol indophenol. Simulation of the cyclic voltammetry has enabled a thorough kinetic analysis of the system, which reveals that methylene blue acts as a two&#8208;electron acceptor. In contrast, the other two mediators act as single electron oxidants. The different electrochemical driving forces imparted by these mediators also lead to significantly different outer sphere electron transfer rates with AOR. This work shows that electrocatalytic aldehyde oxidation can be achieved at a low applied electrochemical potential leading to an extremely energy efficient catalytic process.

         <dc:description>
A portfolio of photochemical transformations found in a variety of areas can be rationalized through consideration of either gain of 4n&#960;&#8208;electron aromaticity or relief of (4n+2)&#8201;&#960;&#8208;electron antiaromaticity in excited states of &#960;&#960;* character. These back&#8208;of&#8208;an&#8208;envelope tools provided by Baird's rule serve as a compass for excursions in electronically excited states. More information can be found in the Review by H.

         <title>Reduction of Nitrous Oxide by Light Alcohols Catalysed by a Low&#8208;Valent Ruthenium Diazadiene Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low valent diruthenium dihydride complex catalyses the reduction of nitrous oxide with primary alcohols or hydrogen. Light alcohols (methanol, ethanol) or benzylic alcohols are transformed in a dehydrogenative coupling reaction to carboxylate derivatives, while N2O is converted to N2 and H2O.The reaction proceeds under mild conditions achieving TON of up to 480 and TOF of 56&#8197;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
Decomposition of the environmentally harmful gas nitrous oxide (N2O) is usually performed thermally or catalytically. Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) is currently the most promising technology for N2O mitigation, a multicomponent heterogeneous catalytic system that employs reducing agents such as ammonia, hydrogen, hydrocarbons, or a combination thereof. This study reports the first homogenous catalyst that performs the reduction of nitrous oxide employing readily available and cheap light alcohols such as methanol, ethanol or ethylene glycol derivatives. During the reaction, these alcohols are transformed in a dehydrogenative coupling reaction to carboxylate derivatives, while N2O is converted to N2 and H2O, later entering the reaction as substrate. The reaction is catalysed by the low&#8208;valent dinuclear ruthenium complex [Ru2H(&#956;&#8208;H)(Me2dad)(dbcot)2] that carries a diazabutadiene, Me2dad, and two rigid dienes, dbcot, as ligands. The reduction of nitrous oxide proceeds with low catalyst loadings under relatively mild conditions (65&#8211;80&#8201;&#176;C, 1.4&#8197;bar N2O) achieving turnover numbers of up to 480 and turnover frequencies of up to 56&#8197;h&#8722;1.

         <title>Orientational Control of Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Pyrene Clusters by Using a DNA Scaffold</title>

         <dc:description>
Not just any which way: Circularly polarized luminescence from a pyrene cluster in DNA duplexes has been systematically investigated. CPL properties varied depending not only on the distance but also on the relative orientation between two pyrene dimers.







Abstract
We have investigated the chiroptical activities of pyrene clusters incorporated within a DNA duplex. Three pyrene derivatives were prepared on d&#8208;threoninol linkers to allow incorporation within a DNA strand. DNA scaffolds containing dimers, tetramers, and hexamers of the pyrene derivatives were prepared. The homodimers of 1&#8208; and of 4&#8208;pyrenecarboxylic acid, but not 2&#8208;pyrenecarboxylic acid, emitted intense circularly polarized luminescence signals. Although increasing the number of pyrene units weakened the signal, insertion of natural base pairs between two dimers enhanced its intensity. Interestingly, circularly polarized luminescence intensities varied non&#8208;monotonically depending on the number of intervening base pairs, thus indicating the importance of orientation between pyrene dimers. The results presented here could lead to the development of bright circularly polarized luminescence materials and probes.

         <title>Structural Dissection of Epsin&#8208;1 N&#8208;Terminal Helical Peptide: The Role of Hydrophobic Residues in Modulating Membrane Curvature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spatiotemporal structural alterations in cellular membranes are the hallmark of many vital processes. In these cellular events, the induction of local changes in membrane curvature often plays a pivotal role. Many amphiphilic peptides are able to modulate membrane curvature, but there is little information on specific structural factors that direct the curvature change. Epsin&#8208;1 is a representative protein thought to initiate invagination of the plasma membrane upon clathrin&#8208;coated vesicles formation. Its N&#8208;terminal helical segment (EpN18) plays a key role in inducing positive membrane curvature. This study aimed to elucidate the essential structural features of EpN18 in order to better understand general curvature&#8208;inducing mechanisms, and to design effective tools for rationally controlling membrane curvature. Structural dissection of peptides derived from EpN18 revealed the decisive contribution of hydrophobic residues to (i) enhancing membrane interactions, (ii) helix structuring, (iii) inducing positive membrane curvature, and (iv) loosening lipid packing. The strongest effect was attained by substitution with leucine residues, as this EpN18 analog showed a marked ability to promote the influx of octa&#8208;arginine cell&#8208;penetrating peptides into living cells.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Tuning the bridging fashion of anilato ligand in dinuclear DyIII complexes, reveals a sizable effect on the slow relaxation of magnetization. Combined experimental and theoretical studies divulge that the geometry with high order axial symmetry (pseudo square antiprism) reduces the transverse crystal fields corresponding to QTM resulting in a significant increase in energy barrier (Ueff = 518 cm&#8208;1) through the Orbach relaxation process whereas the geometry with lower symmetry (triangular dodecahedron, pseudo D2d) enhances the transverse crystal fields that accelerate the ground state QTM process. Notably, the value 518 cm&#8208;1 represents the highest energy barrier among anilato ligand based SMMs.</dc:description>

         <title>Differently N&#8208;Capped Analogues of Fmoc&#8208;FF.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Short and ultra&#8208;short peptides have been recently envisioned as excellent building blocks for the formulation of hydrogels with appealing properties. Due to its simplicity and capability to gel under physiological conditions, Fmoc&#8208;FF (N&#945;&#8208;fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl&#8208;diphenylalanine), remains one of the most studied low molecular&#8208;weight hydrogelators. Since its first identification in 2006, a plethora of its analogues were synthetized and investigated for the fabrication of novel supramolecular materials. Here we report a description of the Fmoc&#8208;FF analogues in which the aromatic Fmoc group is replaced with other substituents. These analogues are distinguished into five different classes including derivatives: i) customized with solid phase peptide synthesis protecting groups; ii) containing non&#8208;aromatic groups, iii) containing aromatic groups, iv) derivatized with metal complexes and v) containing stimuli&#8208;responsive groups. The morphological, mechanical, and functional effects caused by this modification on the resulting material are also pointed out.</dc:description>

         <title>[ReH3(PPh3)4] &#8211; A Key Compound in the Rhenium Hydride Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A key to rhenium hydride chemistry: The preparation of crystalline [ReH3(PPh3)4] allows for the preparation of defined rhenium(III) polyhydrido complexes through ligand exchange procedures with more basic phosphines. Azavinylidene complexes of the type [ReH2(PPh3)3(NC(H)R)] are the final products of reactions with nitriles. Potential proton or hydride donors react with [ReH3(PPh3)4] in toluene to give the pentahydride [ReH5(PPh3)3].







Abstract
The chemistry of the rhenium trihydrido complex [ReH3(PPh3)4] (1) has been reinvestigated. An improved synthesis and the solid&#8208;state structure of the compound as well as several reactions are reported. The solid&#8208;state structure of 1 is similar to that of [TcH3(PPh3)4] having a capped&#8208;octahedral coordination sphere. The PPh3 ligands surround the Re atom in a trigonal&#8208;pyramidal mode with a short apical Re&#8722;P bond (2.300(2)&#8197;&#197;) and three longer basal bonds (2.429(2)&#8211;2.449(2)&#8197;&#197;). Reactions of 1 with monodentate phosphines such as PMe3 or PBu3 give the mono&#8208;substituted complexes [ReH3(PPh3)3(PMe3)] (2) and [ReH3(PPh3)3(PBu3)] (3) under retention of the apical PPh3 ligand and substitution of one of the basal PPh3 ligands. The stability of the phosphine trihydride complexes decreases in the order PPh3&gt;PMe3&gt;PBu3. Treatment of [ReH3(PPh3)4] with trityl hexafluorophosphate in CH3CN does not result in a hydride abstraction, but gives the tetrahydrido cation [ReH4(NCCH3)(PPh3)3]+ (4), while reactions with nitriles give unstable azavinylidene complexes of the composition [ReH2(PPh3)3(NC(H)R)] (5). They are formed by an insertion of the nitrile into a Re&#8722;H bond. The solid&#8208;state structure of the methyl derivative [ReH2(PPh3)3(NC(H)CH3)] (5&#8201;a) was determined showing a linear Re&#8722;N&#8722;C unit with rhenium&#8722;nitrogen and nitrogen&#8722;carbon double bonds, while the N=CH&#8722;C bond is clearly bent with an angle of 124&#176;. Two previously unknown polymorphs of [ReH5(PPh3)3] were isolated from reactions of 1 with HOC6H3(CH3)2 and thiourea after prolonged heating in toluene and characterized by IR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Antimicrobial Conjugated Oligoelectrolytes Containing Triphenylphosphonium Solubilizing Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PPh3 helps protect against pathogens: Conjugated oligoelectrolytes are a modular molecular platform for the design of novel antimicrobial agents. Substituting terminal alkylammonium cationic groups with more lipophilic triphenylphosphonium counterparts enabled bactericidal activity towards ESKAPE pathogens and clinically relevant mycobacteria. In vivo efficacy was verified in a murine wound model, at clinically relevant dosages.







Abstract
Conjugated oligoelectrolytes (COEs) are an emerging class of amphiphilic antimicrobial compounds with a modular molecular framework suitable for simple chemical derivatization. Here, a series of COE derivatives with a stilbene&#8208;conjugated segment and triphenylphosphonium (TPP) pendant groups was designed and synthesized to understand how lipophilic cationic groups impact antimicrobial activity. In vitro evaluations against ESKAPE pathogens showed broad&#8208;spectrum activity towards multi&#8208;drug resistant (MDR) bacteria and mycobacteria, with TPP groups enhancing antimicrobial activity towards clinically relevant Gram&#8208;negative strains compared to their ammonium analogues. We studied the interactions of DM6P, the most active TPP&#8208;COE compound, with various membrane assays. Treatment of bacterial cells with DM6P showed enhanced permeability of cell membranes without inducing the development of significant bacterial resistance. Moreover, DM6P eliminated 99.99&#8201;% of methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphyloccocus aureus (MRSA) in an in&#8197;vivo wound model. These results represent a promising chemical strategy for increasing the activity spectrum of membrane&#8208;active COE antibiotics to tackle challenging drug&#8208;resistant targets.

         <title>Diastereoselectivity Switch During Alkene Reductions: Diastereodivergent Syntheses of Molecular Fossils via MHAT or Homogeneous Catalytic Hydrogenation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a diastereoselective and robust strategy we prepared a set of 16 molecular fossils (MF) and confirmed the presence of 6 of them in a 120&#8208;million&#8208;year&#8208;old geological sample. Unlike structural fossils, MF came from soft tissues, and during their (dia)catagenesis they suffer framework and stereochemical modifications exposing their geological history. Such changes and concentration differences helped us to prove an ancient oil migration event.







Abstract
Sixteen geosterane derivatives were synthesized in up to 57&#8201;% overall yields in four steps harnessing the olefin cross&#8208;metathesis (OCM) and Metal hydride H atom transfer (MHAT) or homogeneous hydrogenation reactions as key steps. Drawing on this strategy, the diastereomeric ratio (d.&#8201;r.) reached up to 24&#8201;:&#8201;1 for the thermodynamic isomer and 7&#8201;:&#8201;1 for the other isomer in the hydrogenation step. In a geological sample from northeast Brazil, we confirmed the putative structures previously assumed as methyl 2&#8208;(3&#945;&#8208;5&#945;H&#8208;cholestan) acetate, methyl 2&#8208;(3&#946;&#8208;5&#945;H&#8208;cholestan)acetate, and methyl 6&#8208;(3&#946;&#8208;5&#945;H&#8208;cholestan)hexanoate, as well three new molecular fossils of approximately 120&#8197;million years old. We also proved the migration marking ability of those carboxylic acids derived from forerunner geosteranes during an oil migration event, which suggests their aptitudes as molecular odometers. Our approach demonstrated swiftness and effectiveness in preparing a molecular library of geological biomarkers would also be appropriate to generate stereochemical diversity in molecular libraries for medicinal chemistry and natural product anticipation.

     alt="Diastereoselectivity Switch During Alkene Reductions: Diastereodivergent Syntheses of Molecular Fossils via MHAT or Homogeneous Catalytic Hydrogenation Reactions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Using a diastereoselective&lt;/b&gt; and robust strategy we prepared a set of 16 molecular fossils (MF) and confirmed the presence of 6 of them in a 120-million-year-old geological sample. Unlike structural fossils, MF came from soft tissues, and during their (dia)catagenesis they suffer framework and stereochemical modifications exposing their geological history. Such changes and concentration differences helped us to prove an ancient oil migration event.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixteen geosterane derivatives were synthesized in up to 57&#8201;% overall yields in four steps harnessing the olefin cross-metathesis (OCM) and Metal hydride H atom transfer (MHAT) or homogeneous hydrogenation reactions as key steps. Drawing on this strategy, the diastereomeric ratio (d.&#8201;r.) reached up to 24&#8201;:&#8201;1 for the thermodynamic isomer and 7&#8201;:&#8201;1 for the other isomer in the hydrogenation step. In a geological sample from northeast Brazil, we confirmed the putative structures previously assumed as methyl 2-(3&#945;-5&#945;H-cholestan) acetate, methyl 2-(3&#946;-5&#945;H-cholestan)acetate, and methyl 6-(3&#946;-5&#945;H-cholestan)hexanoate, as well three new molecular fossils of approximately 120&#8197;million years old. We also proved the migration marking ability of those carboxylic acids derived from forerunner geosteranes during an oil migration event, which suggests their aptitudes as molecular odometers. Our approach demonstrated swiftness and effectiveness in preparing a molecular library of geological biomarkers would also be appropriate to generate stereochemical diversity in molecular libraries for medicinal chemistry and natural product anticipation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Single&#8208;molecule junctions and self&#8208;assembled monolayer junctions are attractive architectures for thermoelectric devices. However, given the poor thermoelectric performance of common organic molecules, molecules characterized by high conductance and Seebeck coefficient values have been extensively explored. Metal complexes are promising possible active components of high&#8208;performance thermoelectric devices given that metal&#8211;ligand combinations and functions can be made to vary to modulate the transmission functions, thus strongly influencing conductance and Seebeck coefficient. In this concept article are described recent studies wherein thermoelectric measurements were conducted on metal complex junctions.

         <dc:description>Since the pioneer reports of Akiyama and Terada on Br&#248;nsted acid organocatalysis, this field never stopped growing with the development of ingenious strategies for the activation of challenging poorly reactive substrates. If the development of superacidic organocatalysts is an important way to selectively functionalize reluctant electrophiles, other approaches have emerged such as the combination of Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acids as well as the consecutive organocatalysis and superacid activation. This concept aims to highlight these different strategies and demonstrate their complementarity.</dc:description>

         <title>C&#8208;H Functionalization of Heterocycles with Triplet Carbenes by means of an Unexpected 1,2&#8208;Alkyl Radical Migration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The C&#8208;H functionalization of indole heterocycles constitutes a key strategy to leverage the synthesis of endogenous signaling molecules such as tryptamine or tryptophol. Herein, we report on the photocatalytic reaction of ethyl diazoacetate with indole, which shows an unusual solvent dependency. While C2&#8208;functionalization occurs under protic conditions, the use of aprotic solvents leads to a complete reversal of selectivity and exclusive C3&#8208;functionalization occurs. To rationalize for this unexpected reactivity switch, we have conducted detailed theoretical and experimental studies, which suggest the participation of a triplet carbene intermediate that undergoes initial C2&#8208;functionalization. A distinct cationic [1,2]&#8208;alkyl radical migration then leads to formation of C3&#8208;functionalized indole. We conclude with the application of this photocatalytic reaction to access oxidized tryptophol derivatives including gram&#8208;scale synthesis and derivatization reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis of Heterobiaryls through Ring Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atropisomeric heterobiaryls play a vital role in natural products, chiral ligands, organocatalysts, and other research fields, which has aroused great interest from chemists in recent years. Up until now, a growing number of optically active heterobiaryls based on indole, quinoline, isoquinoline, pyridine, pyrrole, azole, and benzofuran&#8208;skeletons have been successfully synthesized through metal or organic catalytic cross&#8208;coupling, functionalization of prochiral or racemic hererobiaryls, and ring formation. Among different strategies for the atroposelective synthesis of heterobiaryls, the strategy of ring formation has become a vital tool toward this goal. In this review, we summarized the enantioselective synthesis of axially chiral heterobiaryls through a ring formation approach, such as cycloaddition, cyclization, and chirality conversion. Meanwhile, the reaction mechanism and the corresponding applications of the chiral heterobiaryls are also involved.</dc:description>

         <title>The Adsorptive Separation of Ethylene from C2 Hydrocarbons by Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Separating ethylene (C2H4) from the C2 hydrocarbons is of prime industrial importance for the process of high&#8208;purity C2H4 as an essential raw material in the petrochemical industry. Due to their similar physicochemical properties, the separation of C2H4 from the C2 hydrocarbons typically entails high&#8208;energy separation technologies such as cryogenic distillation and extraction. Alternatively, adsorption separation using metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are low&#8208;energy separation technologies that manufacture high&#8208;purity gas under mild conditions. In this review, we summarized the recent advances in MOFs for the separation and purification of C2H4 from the C2 hydrocarbons. The mechanisms underlying separating C2H4 from the C2 hydrocarbons using MOFs are also highlighted. This review also discussed the major challenges and developments of MOFs to separate C2H4 from the C2 hydrocarbons.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered Reversible Open&#8208;Close Motion of a Chiral Molecular Plier to Modulate Guest Binding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A chiral molecular plier&#8217;s design, synthesis, characterisation and operations are presented. The molecular plier encompasses three units: a BINOL unit which acts as a pivot as well as a chiral inducer, an azobenzene unit, which acts as a photo&#8208;switchable component and two zinc porphyrin, acting as a reporter. E to Z isomerisation persuaded by irradiating with 370 nm light alters the dihedral angle of the pivot BINOL unit, which adjusts the distance between two porphyrin units. The plier can be switched to its initial state by exposure to 456 nm light or heating at 50 &#186;C. NMR, CD and molecular modelling supported the reversible switching and change in dihedral angle and distance between reporter moiety, which was further exploited for binding with several ditopic guests. The longest guest was found to form the strongest complex, R,R&#8208;isomer formed a stronger complex than S,S&#8208;isomer, Z&#8208;isomer of the plier formed stronger complex than the E&#8208;isomer with the guest. Moreover, complexation also increased the E&#8208;to&#8208;Z switching efficiency and decreased the thermal back isomerisation of the azobenzene unit.</dc:description>

         <title>Wide&#8208;Temperature Flexible Supercapacitor of Organohydrogel Electrolyte and Its Combined Electrode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogel&#8208;based flexible supercapacitors possess the merits of highly ionic conductivity and superior power density, but the existence of water limits their application in the extreme temperature scenarios. Noticeably, it is a challenge for people to design more extremely temperature adaptable systems for flexible supercapacitor based on hydrogel with wide&#8208;temperature region. In this work, a wide&#8208;temperature flexible supercapacitor that can operate at &#8208;20&#8208;80 &#176;C is fabricated by the organohydrogel electrolyte and its combined electrode (also known as electrode/electrolyte composite). By introducing highly hydratable LiCl into ethylene glycol (EG)/H2O binary solvent, owning to the ionic hydration effect of LiCl and hydrogen&#8208;bond interaction between EG and H2O molecules, the organohydrogel electrolyte exhibits satisfactory freezing resistance (&#8208;113.9 &#176;C of freezing point), anti&#8208;drying capability (78.2% of weight retention after vacuum drying at 60 &#176;C for 12 hours) and excellent ionic conductivity both at room temperature (13.9 mS/cm) and low temperature (6.5 mS/cm after 31 days at &#8208;20 &#176;C). By using organohydrogel electrolyte as binder, the prepared electrode/electrolyte composite effectively reduces interface impedance and enhances specific capacitance due to the uninterrupted ion transport channels and extended interface contact area. The assembled supercapacitor delivers a specific capacitance of 149 F/g, power density of 160 W/kg and energy density of 13.24 Wh/kg at the current density of 0.2 A/g. The initial capacitance can maintain 100% after 2000 cycles at 1.0 A/g. More importantly, the specific capacitances can be well maintained even at &#8208;20 &#176;C and 80 &#176;C. With other advantages such as excellent mechanical property, the supercapacitor is an ideal power source suitable for various working conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Chemoselective Synthesis of Indole Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A facile and efficient synthesis of polysubstituted indoles from &#945;&#8208;arylamino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;enamides, &#945;&#8208;arylamino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;oxo&#8208;amides, or their tautomeric mixture via electrophilic activation strategy is described. The salient feature of this methodology is the use of either combined Hendrickson reagent and triflic anhydride (Tf2O) or triflic acid (TfOH) to control the chemoselectivity in the intramolecular cyclodehydration to provide a predictable approach to these valuable indoles with flexible substituent patterns. Moreover, the mild reaction conditions, simple execution, high chemoselectivity, excellent yields, and wide range of synthetic potential of products make this protocol much attractive for academic research and practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold Teflates Revisited: From the Lewis Superacid [Au(OTeF5)3] to the Anion [Au(OTeF5)4]&#8722;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic route to the gold(III) pentafluoroorthotellurates [Au(OTeF5)3] and [Au(OTeF5)4]&#8722; based on commercially available gold chlorides is presented. The former was classified as a Lewis superacid, with an enhanced Lewis acidity yet better manageability compared to AuF3, underlining the potential of the &#8722;OTeF5 group to also stabilize highly reactive transition&#8208;metal compounds.







Abstract
A new synthetic access to the Lewis acid [Au(OTeF5)3] and the preparation of the related, unprecedented anion [Au(OTeF5)4]&#8722; with inorganic or organic cations starting from commercially available and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle gold chlorides are presented. In this first extensive study of the Lewis acidity of a transition&#8208;metal teflate complex by using different experimental and quantum chemical methods, [Au(OTeF5)3] was classified as a Lewis superacid. The solid&#8208;state structure of the triphenylphosphine oxide adduct [Au(OPPh3)(OTeF5)3] was determined, representing the first structural characterization of an adduct of this highly reactive [Au(OTeF5)3]. Therein, the coordination environment around the gold center slightly deviates from the typical square planar geometry. The [Au(OTeF5)4]&#8722; anion shows a similar coordination motif.

         <title>CryoEM Structure with ATP Synthase Enables Late&#8208;stage Diversification of Cruentaren A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cruentaren A is a natural product that exhibits potent antiproliferative activity against various cancer cell lines, yet its binding site within ATP synthase remained unknown, limiting the development of improved analogues as anticancer agents. Herein, we report the cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) structure of cruentaren A bound to ATP synthase, which allowed for the design of new inhibitors via semisynthetic modification. Examples of cruentaren A derivatives include a trans&#8208;alkene isomer, which was found to exhibit similar activity as cruentaren A against three cancer cell lines as well as several other analogues that retained potent inhibitory activity. Together, these studies provide a foundation for the generation of cruentaren A derivatives as potential therapeutics for the treatment of cancer.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Photooxygenation of Anthracene Carboxyimide for Singlet Oxygen Formation: Mechanistic Study and Efficient Nitrite Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polycyclic aromatic endoperoxides are important sources of singlet oxygen (1O2) and their formation from polyacenes is well established. Anthracene carboxyimides are of particular interest as they exhibit excellent antitumor activity and possess unique photochemical properties. However, the photooxygenation of the synthetically versatile anthracene carboxyimide moiety has not been reported due to its competing [4+4] photodimerization reaction. Herein, we describe the reversible photo&#8208;oxidation of an anthracene carboxyimide. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis surprisingly revealed the formation of a racemic mixture of chiral hydroperoxides, rather than the expected endoperoxide. The photoproduct undergoes both photo&#8208; and thermolysis to form 1O2. Activation parameters were derived for the thermolysis and the mechanisms of photooxygenation and thermolysis are discussed. The anthracene carboxyimide also showed high selectivity and sensitivity for nitrite anions in acidic aqueous media and possessed stimuli&#8208;responsive behaviour.</dc:description>

         <title>Fine Tuning of Quantum Dots Photocatalysts for the Synthesis of Tropane Alkaloid Skeletons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Several types of Quantum Dots (QDs) (CdS, CdSe and InP, as well as core&#8208;shell QDs such as type I InPZnS, quasi type&#8208;II CdSe&#8208;CdS and inverse type&#8208;I CdS&#8208;CdSe) were considered for generating &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl free radicals. The feasibility of the oxidation of the N&#8208;aryl amines and the generation of the desired radical was evidenced experimentally by quenching of the photoluminescence of the QDs and by testing a vinylation reaction using an alkenylsulfone radical trap. The QDs were tested in a radical [3+3]annulation reaction giving access to tropane skeletons and that requires the completion of two consecutive catalytic cycles. Several QDs such as CdS core, CdSe core and inverted type I CdS&#8208;CdSe core&#8208;shell proved to be efficient photocatalysts for this reaction. Interestingly, the addition of a second shorter chain ligand to the QDs appeared to be essential to complete the second catalytic cycle and to obtain the desired bicyclic tropane derivatives. Finally, the scope of the [3+3]&#8208;annulation reaction was explored for the best performing QDs and isolated yields that compares well with classical iridium photocatalysis were obtained.</dc:description>

         <title>Interface Regulation for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells through Potassium Citrate Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficiency and stability are key factors determining the final cost of electricity that perovskite solar cells (PSCs) generate. To date, effective strategy to progress in achieving efficient and stable PSCs is still a difficult problem that researchers continue to explore. Here, we report a useful way to improve the quality of SnO2 film by introducing potassium citrate (PC) into SnO2 nanoparticles solution. PC passivates interface defects between perovskite and SnO2 layers via the interactions of functional groups&#160;(K+, &#8208;COO&#8208;) in PC with undersaturated Pb and I ions in perovskite and Sn4+ in SnO2. The resultant photovoltaic (PV) device achieves a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.79%. The introduction of PC interface also significantly suppress the degradation of PSCs, by which 87.6% of initial PCE is maintained after 2850 hours storage in ambient environment. Moreover, the devices retained 95.5% of initial PCE under 1&#8208;sun continuous illumination for 1000 hours.</dc:description>

Abstract
A chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective aza&#8208;Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction of 5&#8208;aminopyrazole derivatives with cyclic ketimines attached to a neutral functional group is reported. This protocol allows the formation of pyrazole&#8208;based C2&#8208;quaternary indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones with high enantioselectivities and regioselectivities. Moreover, gram&#8208;scale synthesis of the 5&#8208;aminopyrazole&#8208;based C2&#8208;quaternary indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones was performed, with no decrease in the yield and enantioselectivity.

         <title>Piezoelectric Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Mediated Mechanoredox Borylation and Arylation Reactions by Ball Milling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon mechanical agitation, piezoelectric metal&#8208;organic frameworks UiO&#8208;66 and UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 can act as electron donors to promote mechanoredox reactions, enabling both borylation and arylation reactions between aryl diazonium salts and bis(pinacolato)diborane or heteroarenes with high efficiencies.







Abstract
Herein, metal&#8208;organic frameworks UiO&#8208;66 and UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 were synthesized, and their piezoelectric properties were characterized by piezoresponse force microscopy. Under mechanical agitation, the highly polarized UiO&#8208;66 and UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 can act as electron donors to reduce aryl diazonium salts, forming the aryl radical species, which further react with bis(pinacolato)diborane or heteroarenes to generate the desired products with broad substrate scope. For all substrates, it was found that the reactions mediated by UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, which exhibited better piezoelectric property, were more efficient than those promoted by UiO&#8208;66. Moreover, it was shown that the convenient regeneration of spent catalysts can be reused for promoting mechanoredox reactions without loss of activities by taking advantage of the unmatched repairability of metal&#8208;organic frameworks. Mechanistic studies revealed that a radical pathway was involved in these transformations.

         <title>The Prominence of Facilitator&#160;&#960;&#8208;Holes: The Classic N&#8592;N Pnictogen Bonding in Nitrobenzene&#8208;Ammonia Dimer with its Structural Elucidation and Experimental Characterization at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct correlation between the magnitude of potential at the &#960;&#8208;hole over nitrogen in &#8208;NO2 moiety and the strength of the pnictogen bond hosted by nitrogen is obtained by infrared spectroscopy of matrix isolated heterodimers of nitromethane and nitrobenzene with ammonia. The pivotal role of &#960;&#8208;hole over nitrogen as a facilitator of pnictogen bonds is demonstrated.







Abstract
The nitrogen of nitro group is a paradigmatic pnictogen due the presence of a&#160;&#960;&#8208;hole and a number of studies have been performed recently on prototypical nitromethane (NM). Homodimers and heterodimers of NM are sustained by&#160;&#960;&#8208;hole driven pnictogen bonds hosted by nitrogen. To understand the effect of substitution on this &#960;&#8208;hole and thus the pnictogen bond, heterodimers of nitrobenzene (NB; phenyl substitution in place of methyl) with ammonia (AM) have been probed, as a test case, using matrix isolation infrared spectroscopy and&#160;ab initio&#160;computations. Of the four structures optimized on the potential energy surface the energetically dominant global minimum, stabilized by &#960;&#8208;hole driven O=N&#8592;N pnictogen bonding with co&#8208;operative N&#8722;H&#8592;O hydrogen bonding, was experimentally identified at low temperatures. A comparison of the pnictogen bonding of NB&#8208;AM dimers with NM counterpart (NM&#8208;AM dimers) divulged the dominance of electrostatic origin of pnictogen bonding in both the class of dimers. The reduced strength of pnictogen bonding in NB&#8208;AM dimers in comparison to NM&#8208;AM dimers was discerned, which has been established to be a consequence of the reduced electrostatic potential at the &#960;&#8208;hole of NB relative to that in NM. The strength of&#160;&#960;&#8208;hole driven pnictogen bond was directly correlated with the binding energy and the infrared shifts in the signature vibrational bands of the NB, NM and AM submolecules due to dimerization under matrix isolated conditions at low temperatures.

         <title>Base Pair Stacking Modulates Solid&#8208;State Charge Transport in DNA Hairpins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The charge transport in a series of thymine&#8208;thymine mismatched DNA hairpins is fine&#8208;tuned. Surprisingly, the solid&#8208;state charge transport enhancement exhibits a semi&#8208;quantitative linear relationship with the integrity changes of DNA base pair stacking, which is modulated by the Hg ion chelation and DNA sequence. Such a deep mechanistic understanding will guide the design of future DNA&#8208;based electronics and bio/chemical sensors.







Abstract
Particular interest has been focused on modulation of solid&#8208;state charge transport (CT) in DNA. Nevertheless, it remains challenging to do so in a sensitive and predictive manner due to the lack of a definite relationship between DNA base pair stacking and DNA CT. The challenges can be mainly attributed to the ill&#8208;defined systems, which may lead to ambiguous and even contradictory conclusions. Here, we use DNA hairpins to construct the well&#8208;defined self&#8208;assembled monolayers. We reveal nearly positive&#8208;linear correlations between DNA conformation and CT in the DNA hairpins regulated with metal ion chelation and DNA sequence. The correlations have been confirmed by the solid&#8208;state current&#8208;voltage characteristics and circular dichroism in solution. The enhanced CT via metal ion chelated DNA hairpins is mainly from the improved DNA energy coupling to electrodes, not the almost unchanged energy barrier when Hg ion&#8208;induced DNA conformational switches toward the canonical B&#8208;form.

         <title>An Innovative Bi12SiO20 Multistage Cubic Nanospheres Cathode for High&#8208;Performance Bi//Zn Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique multistage cubic nanospheres Bi12SiO20 architecture is prepared by a simple calcination method and used as a cathode for high&#8208;performance Bi//Zn battery. The battery fabricated by the MCS&#8208;Bi12SiO20 cathode and Zn foil anode shows superior energy density (247.5&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) and excellent cycling durability (100&#8201;% capacity retention after 5000 cycles).







Abstract
Alkaline Bi//Zn batteries with superb safety, low cost, and high power density are promising candidates for large&#8208;scale electrical energy storage. However, their developments are severely limited by the Bi&#8208;based cathode as the unsatisfying capacity and cycle life. Herein, an innovative multistage cubic nanospheres Bi12SiO20 (MCS&#8208;Bi12SiO20) is successfully synthesized by a simple calcination method, which shows excellent energy storage performances of superior specific capacity (294&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and outstanding rate capability (134&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 12&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). When coupled with Zn anode a superior MCS&#8208;Bi12SiO20//Zn is fabricated, which delivers a high energy density of 247.5&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at the power density of 375&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1. Additionally, the MCS&#8208;Bi12SiO20//Zn battery shows excellent cycle life, which reserves more than 100&#8201;% of its original capacity after 5000 cycles. Such performance is higher than previously reported Bi//Zn battery and most other Zn batteries. This is the first example of using Bi12SiO20 as cathode for RAZBs, which may provide highly promising material towards better Bi//Zn battery.

         <title>Electrochemical and Structural Characterization of Soft Landed Tungsten&#8208;Substituted Lindqvist Polyoxovanadate&#8208;Alkoxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion soft&#8208;landing enables accurate characterization of compound features using high&#8208;quality separation power. Using a quadrupole mass filter, ions are mass&#8208;selected and deposited onto a surface maintaining structural integrity. Doped and undoped polyoxovandates synthesized using solvothermal conditions are accurately characterized using infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and cyclic voltammetry.







Abstract
Lindqvist polyoxovanadate&#8208;alkoxide (POV&#8208;alkoxide) clusters are excellent candidates for applications in energy storage and conversion due to their rich electrochemical profiles. One approach to tune the redox properties of these cluster complexes is through substitutional cationic doping within the hexavanadate core. Here, we report the synthesis of a series of tungsten&#8208;substituted POV&#8208;alkoxide clusters with one and two tungsten atoms. Soft landing of mass&#8208;selected ions was used to purify heterometal POV&#8208;alkoxides that cannot be readily separated using conventional approaches. The soft landed POV&#8208;alkoxides are characterized using infrared reflection&#8208;absorption spectroscopy and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The redox properties of the isolated ions are examined using an in&#8197;situ electrochemical cell which enables traditional in vacuo electrochemical measurements inside of an ion soft landing instrument. Although the overall cluster core retains redox activity after tungsten doping, vanadium&#8208;based redox couples (VV/VIV) are shifted substantially, indicating a pronounced effect of a heteroatom on the electronic structure of the core.

         <title>Green Synthesis and Analytical Characterization of Core&#8208;Shell Copper Sub&#8208;Microparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green procedure for the preparation of Cu particles is here described, exploiting the stabilizing efficacy of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) to obtain Cu@PVP core&#8208;shell particles. A simple washing and immobilization protocol allows modifying a polymer matrix without altering its physicochemical properties. Composite thin films show a controlled ionic release with promising antimicrobial activity.







Abstract
This study demonstrates a simple and reproducible approach to synthesize green core&#8208;shell copper sub&#8208;microparticles stabilized by poly(n&#8208;vinyl)pyrrolidone (PVP). Cu@PVP colloids were here prepared using copper sulfate pentahydrate as precursor and glucose as reducing agent. The presence of PVP in the synthetic medium eliminates the need for an inert atmosphere during the process, thus simplifying the whole method. Both the morphology and the spectroscopic properties of Cu@PVP colloids were investigated by transmission electron microscopy, and infrared, UV&#8208;Vis and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopies. Size distributions and average shell thickness were obtained by statistical analysis on TEM micrographs, and spectroscopies demonstrated the formation of a PVP layer around the copper core. The produced colloids were employed in composite thin films for potential antimicrobial application, in association with a highly&#8208;recyclable polymer: polycarbonate (4,4&#8217;&#8208;(1&#8208;methylethylidene)bis(phenol)).

         <title>Bioinspired Design of an Uncharged Ambipolar Helical Scaffold To Achieve Efficient Solid&#8208;State Proton Conduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereo&#8208;divergent packing of helical scaffolds based on pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarboxamide is observed in two different solid forms obtained from solvents of different polarity. Efficient solid&#8208;state proton conduction is observed in the yellow form, which has a homochiral molecular arrangement with closer intermolecular proximity, and spatial alignment of polar residues.







Abstract
This work demonstrates highly efficient solid&#8208;state proton conduction in helical organic scaffolds inspired by the biomolecule gramicidin&#8197;A. The scaffold, 1, derived from a pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarboxamide (PDC) residue adopts a helical conformation that is stabilized by a network of strong bifurcated intramolecular H&#8208;bonds between the polar residues that align the inner (concave) face of the molecule, while the aromatic units in 1 are oriented outwards. As a result, the helix attains an ambipolar nature just like gramicidin&#8197;A. Two different solid forms of 1 could be isolated: a yellow solid from high&#8208;polarity solvents and an orange solid from low&#8208;polarity solvents. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) studies showed that in the former, molecules of 1 are stacked in a homochiral fashion, while in the latter heterochiral stacks of 1 were present. The yellow form exhibited an almost &#8764;300&#8208;fold higher conductivity (of up to 0.12&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 95&#8201;&#176;C and 95&#8201;% relative humidity) than the orange form as a result of closer intermolecular proximity and lower activation energy of 0.098&#8197;eV, thus indicating a Grotthus mechanism of proton transport. This study establishes the key role of bioinspired design and controlled stereo&#8208;organization of such discrete uncharged organic molecules in achieving efficient solid&#8208;state proton conduction.

         <title>Balancing Attraction and Repulsion: The Influence of London Dispersion in [10]Cycloparaphenylene&#8208;Fullerene Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The supramolecular assembly between substituted [10]cycloparaphenylene (s[10]CPP) and fullerenes was studied to investigate the subtle interplay of steric repulsion, conformation and attractive London dispersion interactions. For this, [10]CPP and a tert&#8208;butyl ester&#8208;substituted analogue were employed as host molecules whose fluorescence is quenched upon addition of C60 as well as alkyl malonyl ester&#8208;substituted fullerenes.







Abstract
Herein we present a systematic study of the influence of different alkyl chains in malonyl ester fullerene adducts with [10]cycloparaphenylene ([10]CPP]) and a tert&#8208;butyl (tBu) ester&#8208;substituted [10]CPP analogue. The association constants between the nanoring hosts and the fullerene guests were determined by fluorescence quenching experiments. The trends in association were rationalized by an interplay of repulsion arising from an extended volume and London dispersion as an attractive counterpart.

The trends in association were rationalized by an interplay of repulsion arising from an extended volume and London dispersion as an attractive counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>No Transition Metals Required &#8211; Oxygen Promoted Synthesis of Imines from Primary Alcohols and Amines under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of imines denotes a cornerstone in organic chemistry. The use of alcohols as renewable substituents for carbonyl&#8208;functionality represents an attractive opportunity. Consequently, carbonyl moieties can be in situ generated from alcohols upon transition&#8208;metal catalysis under inert atmosphere. Alternatively, bases can be utilized under aerobic conditions. In this context, we report the synthesis of imines from benzyl alcohols and anilines, promoted by KOtBu under aerobic conditions at room temperature in the absence of any transition&#8208;metal catalyst. A detailed investigation of the radical mechanism of the underlying reaction is presented. This reveals a complex reaction network fully supporting the experimental findings.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemistry, Chemo&#8208;Ecology, and Biological Activities of Uncommon and Structurally Diverse Sesquiterpenoids from the Sanya Bay Nudibranch Hexabranchus sanguineus</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A detailed chemical investigation of the Sanya Bay nudibranch Hexabranchus sanguineus yielded thirteen new sesquiterpenoids, namely sanyagunins A&#8722;H, sanyalides A&#8722;C, and sanyalactams A and B, along with eleven known related ones. Sanyalactams A and B feature an unprecedented hexahydrospiro[indene&#8208;2,3'&#8208;pyrrolidine] core. The structures of new compounds were established by a combination of extensive spectroscopic data analysis, quantum mechanical&#8208;nuclear magnetic resonance methods, the modified Mosher's method, and X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Based on analysis of NOESY correlations and the modified Mosher's method, the stereochemistry of two known furodysinane&#8208;type sesquiterpenoids were revised. A plausible biogenetic relationship between these sesquiterpenoids were proposed and discussed, and a chemo&#8208;ecological relationship of the title animal and its possible sponge preys has been analyzed. In bioassays, sanyagunin B showed moderate antibacterial activity, whereas 4a&#8208;formamidogorgon&#8208;11&#8208;ene exhibited potent cytotoxicity with IC50 values ranging from 0.87 to 1.95 &#956;M.</dc:description>

         <title>Determinative Effect of Axial Linearity on Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet Performance in Dinuclear Dysprosium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report two dichloride&#8208;bridged dinuclear dysprosium(III) complexes based on salen ligands, namely, [Dy(L1)(&#956;&#8208;Cl)(thf)]2 (1; H2L1 = N,N&#697;&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsalicylidene)phenylenediamine) and [Dy2(L2)2(&#956;&#8208;Cl)2(thf)2]2 (2; H2L2 = N,N&#697;&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsalicylidene)ethylenediamine). These two complexes have two short Dy&#8722;O(PhO) bonds that have angles of ~90&#176; for 1 and ~143&#176; for 2, leading to clear slow relaxation of the magnetization for 2 and not for 1. Compound 2 has a near&#8208;identical core to the recently reported compound [Dy2(L3)2(&#956;&#8208;Cl)2(thf)2] (3; H2L3 = N&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)&#8208;N,N&#8208;bis(2&#697;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#697;,5&#697;&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbenzyl)amine), the only substantial difference being the relative angle of the two O(PhO)&#8722;Dy&#8722;O(PhO) vectors, which are collinear in 2 owing to inversion symmetry and make an angle of ~68&#176; in 3 owing to a molecular C2 axis. We show that this subtle structural difference leads to large differences in the dipolar ground states, giving rise to open magnetic hysteresis for 3 and not for 2.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards a Rational Design of Antibody&#8208;Recruiting Molecules Through a Computational Microscopy View of Their Interactions with the Target Antibody</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antibody recruiting molecules (ARMs) are an innovative class of chimeric molecules, consisting of an antibody&#8208;binding ligand (ABL) and a target&#8208;binding ligand (TBL). ARMs mediate ternary complex formation between a target cell of interest for elimination and endogenous antibodies that are present in human serum. Clustering of fragment crystallizable (Fc) domains on the surface of antibody&#8208;bound cells mediate destruction of the target cell by innate immune effector mechanisms. ARMs are typically designed by conjugating small molecule haptens to a (macro)molecular scaffold, without considering the structure of the respective anti&#8208;hapten antibody. Here we report on a computational molecular modeling methodology that allows for studying the close contacts between ARMs and the anti&#8208;hapten antibody, considering (1) the spacer length between ABL and TBL; (2) the number of ABL and TBL, and (3) the molecular scaffold onto which these are positioned. Our model predicts the difference in binding modes of the ternary complex and predicts which ARMs are optimal recruiters. Avidity measurements of the ARM&#8208;antibody complex and ARM&#8208;mediated antibody recruitment to cell surfaces&#160; in vitro &#160;confirmed these computational modeling predictions. This kind of multiscale molecular modelling holds potential for design of drug molecules that rely on antibody binding for their mechanism of action.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoactive Organo&#8208;Sulfur Polymers for Hydrogen Generation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elemental sulfur was coupled with alkenes to generate photoactive polymers that can produce hydrogen from water.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of photoactive polymeric organo&#8208;sulfur (POS) materials. These polymers absorb light in the ultraviolet/visible and near&#8208;infrared region of the solar spectrum, and upon irradiation, they reduce water to hydrogen (H2). The decoration of POS materials with nitrile (&#8722;CN) groups is found to be the critical factor for enhanced interactions with the co&#8208;catalyst, Ni2P, leading to greater H2 evolution rates compared to the nitrile&#8208;free POS material.

         <title>In Vivo Applications of Bioorthogonal Reactions: Chemistry and Targeting Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioorthogonal chemistry in the in vivo settings. In this review, we discuss the latest trends in the in vivo applications of bioorthogonal reactions. The advances in bioorthogonal reactions that are considered for in&#8197;vivo applications, and the targeting methods used to deliver the biorthogonal components to the desired site of action, are discussed along with the pretargeting approach for radiolabelling.







Abstract
Bioorthogonal chemistry involves selective biocompatible reactions between functional groups that are not normally present in biology. It has been used to probe biomolecules in living systems, and has advanced biomedical strategies such as diagnostics and therapeutics. In this review, the challenges and opportunities encountered when translating in vitro bioorthogonal approaches to in vivo settings are presented, with a focus on methods to deliver the bioorthogonal reaction components. These methods include&#8197;metabolic bioengineering, active targeting, passive targeting, and simultaneously used strategies. The suitability of bioorthogonal ligation reactions and bond cleavage reactions for in vivo applications is critically appraised, and practical considerations such as the optimum scheduling regimen in pretargeting approaches are discussed. Finally, we present our own perspectives for this area and identify what, in our view, are the key challenges that must be overcome to maximise the impact of these approaches.

         <title>Cycloisomerization of Alkyne&#8208;Tethered N&#8208;Acyloxycarbamates to 2&#8208;(3H)Oxazolones through Nitrenoid&#8208;Mediated Carboxyamidation</title>

Zip and shift: Activation of alkyne&#8208;tethered N&#8208;benzoyloxycarbamates with PtCl2/CO or FeCl3 promotes 5&#8208;exo&#8208;cyclization to form carboxyamidation products and subsequent in&#8197;situ double bond migration catalyzed by Pt&#8208;catalyst or DMAP generates the final product 2&#8208;(3H)oxazolones. Experimental evidence suggests a concerted mechanism of nitrenoid&#8208;mediated C&#8722;N and C&#8722;O bond formation.







Abstract
The cycloisomerization of alkyne&#8208;tethered N&#8208;benzoyloxycarbamates to 2&#8208;(3H)oxazolones is described. Two catalytic systems are tailored for intramolecular 5&#8208;exo&#8208;alkyne carboxyamidation and concomitant alkene isomerization. PtCl2/CO (5&#8197;mol%, toluene, 100&#8201;&#176;C) promotes both carboxyamidation and alkene isomerization but has a limited substrate scope. On the other hand, FeCl3 (5&#8197;mol%, CH3CN, 100&#8201;&#176;C) promotes carboxyamidation effectively but a cocatalyst is required for the exocyclic alkene isomerization. Thus, a two&#8208;step one&#8208;pot protocol has been developed for a broader reaction scope, which involves FeCl3&#8208;catalyzed carboxyamidation and base&#8208;induced alkene isomerization. Crossover experiments suggest that these reactions proceed mainly through a mechanism involving acylnitrenoid intermediates rather than carbenoid intermediates.

         <title>Impact of Internal Charge Transfer on the Photophysical Properties of Pyridine&#8208;Fused Phosphorus&#8208;Nitrogen Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first linear donor&#8208;acceptor conjugation seen in the pyridine&#8208;phosphaquinolinone scaffold is reported in this work. The direct result this has on the photophysical properties of various derivatives in both the amidate and imidate forms are explored.







Abstract
The phosphaquinolinone scaffold has been previously studied as a modular core for a variety of fluorescent species where use of substituent effects has focused on increasing or decreasing electron density in the core rings. We now report the synthesis and analysis of several pyridine&#8208;containing phosphaquinolinone species exhibiting notable linear conjugation from the aryl&#8208;substituent to electron&#8208;withdrawing pyridyl nitrogen. Varying the nature of the aryl substituent from electron&#8208;withdrawing to electron&#8208;donating leads to the generation of an internal charge&#8208;transfer (ICT) band in the absorbance spectrum, which becomes the dominant absorbance in terms of intensity in the most electron&#8208;rich &#8208;NMe2 example. This heterocycle exhibits improved photophysical properties compared to others in the set including high quantum yield and considerably red&#8208;shifted emission. The enhanced ICT can be observed in the X&#8208;ray data where a rare example of molecule co&#8208;planarity is observed. Computational data show increased localization of negative charge on the pyridyl nitrogen as the electron&#8208;donating character of the aryl&#8208;substituent increases.

Base&#8208;controlled palladium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular four kinds of five reactions of 5&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1&#8208;(2&#8208;halobenzyl)&#8208;2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones have been developed including C(sp3)&#8722;H arylation and subsequent isomerization, C(sp2)&#8722;H arylation, reductive Heck reaction, and domino Heck reaction/alkylation of aryl C(sp2)&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
Achieving site&#8208;selectivity and chemoselectivity is enormously challenging for substrates with multi&#8208;reactive sites in organic reactions. One kind of model substrates, 5&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1&#8208;(2&#8208;halobenzyl)&#8208;2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones with six reactive sites were chosen as the examples to probe their intramolecular four kinds of five reactions including C(sp3)&#8722;H arylation, C(sp2)&#8722;H arylation, reductive Heck reaction, and domino Heck reaction/alkylation of aryl C(sp2)&#8722;H bonds through variation of the reaction conditions. Screening of the reaction conditions showed that the different bases controlled the palladium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular site&#8208;selectivity and chemoselectivity of the substrates: (i) Cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3) promoted the benzyl C(sp3)&#8722;H arylation of the substrates providing dihydropyrazolo[1,5&#8208;b]isoquinolin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones at 100&#8201;&#176;C, and isomerization of the dihydropyrazolo[1,5&#8208;b]isoquinolin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones gave isoquinoline derivatives at a higher temperature (140&#8201;&#176;C); (ii) Sodium acetate (NaOAc) mediated the aryl C(sp2)&#8722;H arylation of the substrates affording seven&#8208;membered biphenyl N&#8208;heterocycles; (iii) Sodium dichloroacetate (Cl2HCCO2Na) facilitated occurrence of the reductive Heck reaction of the substrates affording 1H&#8208;pyrazolo[5,1&#8208;a]isoindol&#8208;2(8H)&#8208;ones; (iv) Sodium trifluoroacetate (F3CCO2Na) assisted performance of the domino Heck reaction/aryl C(sp2)&#8722;H alkylation of the substrates leading to the spiro heterocycles. The &#8216;one substrate &#8208; multiple reactions &#8208; multiple products&#8217; strategy greatly reduces cost, increases diversity of products, provides more opportunity for screening of pharmaceutical molecules, and enriches modern organic synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Modular Principle for Complex Disordered Tetrahedral Frameworks in Quenched High&#8208;Pressure Phases of Phosphorus Oxide Nitrides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

What happens when you're under pressure: The tetrahedral frameworks of P40O31N46 and P74O59N84 correspond to quenched high&#8208;pressure phases and can be described as different arrangements of the same modular building units. The crystal structures were determined from fragments intergrown with the structurally related compound H3P8O8N9.







Abstract
The crystal structures of the new phosphorus oxide nitrides P40O31N46 and P74O59N84, which were synthesized from amorphous phosphorus oxide nitride imide, exhibit complex frameworks built up from P(O,N)4 tetrahedra. The latter form various chain&#8208;like building units with various degrees of branching. These modular units can be combined and arranged in different ways, which leads to closely related structures and several disordered configurations in each compound. As the material was obtained by high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature synthesis, the disorder is most likely a consequence of quenching a high&#8208;pressure phase with P(O,N)5 trigonal bipyramids. Under ambient conditions, P atoms are expected to relax by moving to the centers of the face&#8208;sharing tetrahedra that constitute the bipyramid. Diffraction patterns acquired with microfocused synchrotron radiation reveal that domains of both compounds are intergrown with H3P8O8N9, whose tetrahedral framework represents a cutout of the structures of both P40O31N46 and P74O59N84. Powder diffraction patterns do not indicate any further phases.

With the increase of x, the liquid crystalline polymers P4VP(CN&#8208;DBE)x changed from lamellar structure to columnar structure. The polymer with columnar structure exhibits more efficient photo&#8208;thermo&#8208;electric effect, with 25&#8197;mA current under UV irradiation.







Abstract
A series of side&#8208;chain liquid crystalline polymers P4VP(CN&#8208;DBE)x, where x is the molar ratio of cyanostilbene (CN&#8208;DBE) to poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine) (P4VP) repeating unit, was synthesized based on the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between P4VP and CN&#8208;DBE. Their luminescent property, liquid crystalline structure and photo&#8208;thermo&#8208;electric property were elucidated using photoluminescence spectra, X&#8208;ray diffraction, thermal imaging and thermoelectric experiments. With the increase of x, the supramolecular system can be changed from lamellar structure to hexagonal columnar structure. Moreover, the P4VP(CN&#8208;DBE)x polymer with columnar structure exhibits more efficient photothermal effect. The temperature of P4VP(CN&#8208;DBE)0.6 can rise to 130&#8201;&#176;C within 10&#8197;s under the irradiation of ultraviolet lamp. In addition, the supramolecular system possesses unique photo&#8208;thermo&#8208;electric conversion ability, and 25&#8197;mA current can be detected in the circuit coupled with the thermoelectric module. This work broadens the potential applications of hydrogen&#8208;bonded polymer, and provides a simple and facile strategy to prepare liquid crystalline polymers with photo&#8208;thermo&#8208;electric property.

         <title>Simultaneous Hydrogen Bonds with Different Binding Modes: The Acceptor &#8220;Rules&#8221; but the Donor &#8220;Chooses&#8221;</title>

Rules and regulations: This work studies the different hydrogen bond (HB) binding modes that can be established between neighbouring HB donors and acceptors in structures with relevance in catalysis and biology.







Abstract
This computational work studies the different hydrogen bond (HB) binding modes that can be established between neighbouring HB donors and acceptors in structures with relevance in catalysis and biology. To analyse the electronic effect on the &#963;&#8208;hole, unsubstituted HB donors and ones with two different substituents, an electron withdrawing (EWG), and an electron donating (EDG) group, were studied. Upon complexation, three different binding modes were observed: bifurcated, parallel, and zigzag. It was found that, as a general trend, HBs within a parallel pattern are the strongest followed by those within bifurcated and zigzag binding modes, leading to a &#8220;competition&#8221; between the last two. Similar patterns and trends have been found in experimental structures found in a search within the CSD. In conclusion, even though the HB acceptors &#8220;rule&#8221; the pattern and strength of the HB interactions within the dimers, when there is an option for different binding modes within a particular dimer, the HB donors &#8220;choose&#8221; the type of binding established.

         <title>Captodative Effect Facilitates the Excitation in Diboron Molecule (CAAC)2B2(SH)2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The co&#8208;planarity of thiol groups and the consequent captodative effect facilitate the electronic excitation in (CAAC)2B2(SR)2 by reducing the singlet&#8208;triplet gap. Two forces contribute to the &#960; electron movements. One is the &#8220;push&#8221; effect from the lone pairs on the sulfur atoms which boost the &#960; electron delocalization between BB center and CAACs. The other is the &#960; electron withdrawal by CAAC within each (CAAC)B(SR) fragment.







Abstract
Given the extraordinary versatility in chemical reactions and applications, boron compounds have gained increasing attentions in the past two decades. One of the remarkable advances is the unprecedented preparation of unsaturated boron species. Notably, Braunschweig et&#8197;al. found that the cyclic (alkyl)(amino) carbenes (CAACs) stabilized diboron molecules (CAAC)2B2(SR)2 host unpaired electrons and exist in the 90&#176;&#8208;twisted diradical form, while other analogues, such as N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs), stabilized diboron molecules prefer a conventional B=B double bond. Since previous studies recognized the differences in the steric effect between CAAC and NHC carbenes, here we focused on the role of thiol substituents in (CAAC)2B2(SR)2 by gradually localizing involved electrons. The co&#8208;planarity of the thiol groups and the consequent captodative effect were found to be the culprit for the 90&#176;&#8208;twisted diradical form of (CAAC)2B2(SR)2. Computational analyses identified two forces contributing to the &#960; electron movements. One is the &#8220;push&#8221; effect of lone pairs on the sulfur atoms which boosts the &#960; electron delocalization between the BB center and CAACs. The other is the &#960; electron delocalization within each (CAAC)B(SR) fragment where the pull effect originates from the &#960; electron withdrawal by CAACs. There are two such independent and orthogonal push&#8208;pull channels which function mainly in individual (CAAC)B(SR) fragments. This enhanced &#960; push&#8208;pull effect in the triplet state facilitates the electronic excitation in (CAAC)2B2(SR)2 by reducing the singlet&#8208;triplet gap.

         <title>Facilitating [2+2] Photocycloadditions by Promoting Oxygen Tolerance and Substrate Activation in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Micellar photocatalysis is used to overrule oxygen quenching and enable a [2+2] photocycloaddition through triplet energy transfer in water under aerobic conditions. The cheap and commercially available self&#8208;assembling sodium lauryl sulfate (SDS)&#8208;micelles were found to increase oxygen tolerance of a typically oxygen sensitive reaction. Furthermore, the use of the micellar solution was found to activate a,b&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds towards energy transfer and allow for [2+2] photocycloadditions to take place. Our preliminary studies of micellar effects on energy transfer&#8208;based reactions were demonstrated by the reaction between a,b&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds and activated alkenes in a mixture of SDS, water and [Ru(bpy)3](PF6)2.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Stepwise Bromination, and Functionalization of Picene Diimide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) diimides are indispensable candidates for n&#8208;type organic semiconductors in organic optoelectronic devices. Developing new PAH diimide building blocks are of remarkable significance for material diversity and further advance in organic semiconductors. In this contribution, 4,5,8,9&#8208;picene diimide (PiDI) was designed and synthesized. Controllable stepwise bromination of PiDI were accomplished to afford 13&#8208;monobromo&#8208;, 13,14&#8208;dibromo&#8208;, 2,13,14&#8208;tribromo&#8208; and 2,11,13,14&#8208;tetrabromo&#8208;PiDI. Moreover, cyanation of 2,11,13,14&#8208;tetrabromo&#8208;PiDI gave the corresponding tetracyanated PiDI, which can be utilized as n&#8208;type semiconductor with OFET electron mobility up 0.073 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1. This result demonstrates the potential of PiDI as a building block for constructing new high&#8208;performance electronic&#8208;transporting materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Stoichiometry&#8208;Directed Two&#8208;Level Hierarchical Growth of Lanthanide&#8208;Based Supramolecular Nanoarchitectures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of a well&#8208;ordered arrangement of atoms on a solid surface has long been sought due to the envisioned applications in many different fields. On&#8208;surface synthesis of metal&#8208;organic networks is one of the most promising fabrication techniques. Hierarchical growth, which involves coordinative schemes with weaker interactions, favours the formation of extended areas with the desired complex structure. However, the control of such hierarchical growth is in its infancy, particularly for lanthanide&#8208;based architectures. Here we describe the hierarchical growth of a Dy&#8208;based supramolecular nanoarchitecture on Au(111). Such an assembly is based on a first hierarchical level of metallo&#8208;supramolecular motifs, which in a second level of hierarchy self&#8208;assemble through directional hydrogen bonds, giving rise to a periodic two&#8208;dimensional supramolecular porous network. Notably, the size of the metal&#8208;organic based tecton of the first level of hierarchy can be tailored by modifying the metal&#8208;organic stoichiometry ratio.</dc:description>

         <title>An Umpolung Approach to Acyclic 1,4&#8208;Dicarbonyl Amides via Photoredox&#8208;generated Carbamoyl Radicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A method for the generation and reaction of carbamoyl radicals from oxamate salts, followed by reaction with electron&#8208;poor olefins, is described. The oxamate salt acts as a reductive quencher in the photoredox catalytic cycle, allowing mild and mass&#8208;efficient formation of 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl products; a challenging transformation in the context of functionalized amide formation. Increased understanding has been obtained by the use of ab initio calculations, in support of experimental observations. Furthermore, steps have been taken towards an environmentally&#8208;friendly protocol, by utilizing sodium as a cheap and low mass counterion, and demonstrating successful reactions using a metal&#8208;free photocatalyst and a sustainable, non&#8208;toxic solvent system.</dc:description>

         <title>Inclusion Complex Formation with Tetra&#8208;PEGylated Tetraphenylporphyrin and Face&#8208;to&#8208;Face Cyclodextrin Dimer through Unprecedented Molecular Threading</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we show a guest&#8211;host inclusion complex formation between tetra&#8208;PEGylated tetraphenylporphyrin with a per&#8208;O&#8208;methylated cyclodextrin (CD) dimer through the molecular threading process that is physically unexpected to occur. Although the molecular size of the PEGylated porphyrin is significantly greater than that of the CD dimer, the sandwich&#8208;type porphyrin/CD dimer = 1:1 inclusion complex was spontaneously formed in water. The ferrous porphyrin complex binds O2 reversibly in aqueous solution, which functions as an artificial O2 carrier in vivo. Pharmacokinetic study using rats revealed that the inclusion complex showed a long circulation in blood in contrast to the complex without PEG. We further demonstrate the unique host&#8208;guest exchange reaction from the PEGylated porphyrin/CD monomer = 1/2 inclusion complex to the 1/1 complex with the CD dimer through the complete dissociation process of the CD monomers.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Hydrostability and Carbon Dioxide Capture of   Boroxine &#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks by One&#8208;Pot Oligoamine Modification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boron&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are susceptible to nucleophilic attack by water at the electron&#8208;deficient boron sites and even slightly humid air could destroy the integrity of their porous frameworks within hours. Such instability is a major limitation to the practical applications of boron&#8208;based COFs. Herein we report a significant enhancement of hydrostability of boroxine&#8208;linked COFs (COF&#8208;1 as representative) by modification with an oligoamine (tetraethylenepentamine, TEPA), which leads to survival of the modified COF in water and long&#8208;time stability under humid atmosphere. Meanwhile, the TEPA modification also results in a considerable increase in CO2 adsorption capacity up to 13 times and a dramatic improvement in CO2/N2 selectivity in low pressure region, which make the modified COF suitable for capturing CO2 from flue gas. This work provides a facile, efficient, and scalable method to greatly improve hydrostability of boroxine&#8208;linked COFs and reshape them into high&#8208;performance CO2 adsorbents.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Decorated Nonaromatic Amine Emitters Towards Efficient Triplet Exciton Utilization in Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Purely organic compounds served as promising materials for organic electronics have intrigued extensive research focuses owing to their unique photophysical and electronic properties. In the field of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), the utilization of triplet excitons is of great significance for realizing high&#8208;performance devices. In contrast to the traditional aromatic amine&#8208;based counterparts, sulfur atom with a high&#8208;level outer orbit simultaneously provides powerful electron&#8208;donating ability and striking spin&#8208;orbit coupling effect to facilitate the utilization of theoretically spin&#8208;forbidden triplet excitons, demonstrating great prospect in constructing highly emissive purely organic emitters for OLED applications. Herein, we summarize the currently developed sulfur&#8208;decorated nonaromatic amine&#8208;based emitters exhibiting attractive photoelectronic characteristics, and gain insight into the understanding of molecular design and photophysical processes of these emitters, providing new perspectives for enriching the existing luminescent material systems and designing high&#8208;performance emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Dimerized Nitrogen&#8208;Annulated Perylene Synthesized from 1,6&#8208;Diazecine as Chiral Emitter</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Embedded by an atropomeric 1,6&#8208;diazecine unit, DNP&#8722;DA demonstrates circularly polarized luminescence, elevated molecular levels, expanded conjugation, supramolecular interactions with acceptors, etc. It presents a limited example of nitrogen&#8722;perylene based chiral emitter and provides the generality of utilizing 1,6&#8208;diazecine as an efficient chiral unit.







Abstract
In this work, nitrogen&#8208;annulated perylene (NP) was dimerized into one framework connected by two nitrogen atoms, generating the target molecule of DNP&#8722;DA. Owing to the substructure of 1,6&#8208;diazecine ten&#8208;membered ring, DNP&#8722;DA illustrates helical chirality with moderate dissymmetry factor, elevated molecular levels, expanded conjugation and supramolecular interactions with acceptors etc. Notably, DNP&#8722;DA represents a limited example of nitrogen&#8722;perylene based CPL emitter with glum around 6&#215;10&#8722;3. Intrigued by the facile fabrication via a simple amination&#8208;cross coupling sequence and other above advancing features, this work demonstrates the potential generality of utilizing 1,6&#8208;diazecine as a chiral unit to build CPL&#8208;active materials.

         <title>Base&#8208;Mediated Radio&#8208;Iodination of Arenes by Using Organosilane and Organogermane as Radiolabelling Precursors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discovery of a mild base mediated process allows radio&#8208;iodination to take place from either silane or germane. Comparison of the results shows that arylgermanes offers clinical potential as radio&#8208;iodination precursors. Proof of concept is demonstrated through the labelling of [125I]IMTO and [125I]MIBG thus offering an alternative to radio&#8208;iododestannylation processes using non&#8208;toxic precursors.







Abstract
The radio&#8208;iodination of arenes is investigated from organosilane and organogermane precursors using ipso&#8208;electrophilic halogenation (IEH). Discovery of a mild base mediated process allows radio&#8208;iodination in HFIP (1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol) of either aryl silane or germane, with germanes being more reactive. Clinical potential of arylgermanes as radio&#8208;iodination precursors is demonstrated through the labelling of [125I]IMTO (iodometomidate) and [125I]MIBG (meta&#8208;iodobenzylguanidine) thus offering an alternative to radio&#8208;iododestannylation processes using non&#8208;toxic precursors.

         <title>Regulating Antifreeze Activity through Water: Latent Functions of the Sugars of Antifreeze Glycoprotein Revealed by Total Chemical Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total chemical synthesis of antifreeze glycoprotein (AFGP) derivatives including partially sugar deleted forms and unnatural forms incorporating glucose&#8208;type sugars instead of galactose&#8208;type sugars of the natural form is described. These elaborated AFGPs indicate a unique function of the sugar residues that form a unique dynamic water phase, thereby inhibiting freezing.







Abstract
Antifreeze glycoprotein (AFGP), which inhibits the freezing of water, is highly O&#8208;glycosylated with a disaccharide, d&#8208;Gal&#946;1&#8208;3&#8208;d&#8208;GalNAc&#945; (GalGalNAc). To elucidate the function of the sugar residues for antifreeze activity at the molecular level, we conducted a total chemical synthesis of partially sugar deleted AFGP derivatives, and unnatural forms of AFGPs incorporating glucose (Glc)&#8208;type sugars instead of galactose (Gal)&#8208;type sugars. These elaborated AFGP derivatives demonstrated that the stereochemistry of each sugar residue on AFGPs precisely correlates with the antifreeze activity. A hydrogen&#8211;deuterium exchange experiment using synthetic AFGPs revealed a different dynamic behavior of water around sugar residues depending on the sugar structures. These results indicate that sugar residues on AFGP form a unique dynamic water phase that disturbs the absorbance of water molecules onto the ice surface, thereby inhibiting freezing.

         <title>Pillar[5]arene Derivatives Embedded with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Luminogens and Their Fluorescence Regulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three meso&#8208;position functionalized pillar[5]arene derivatives (H&#8208;1, H&#8208;2, and H&#8208;3) have been successfully prepared by embedding aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens, diphenyldibenzofulvene and tetraphenylethylene) into the skeleton of supramolecular macrocycles. Their host&#8208;guest complexation properties with pyrazine salt G&#8208;1 and 1,4&#8208;dicyanobutane G&#8208;2 suggest that G&#8208;1 can decrease the fluorescence intensity of the AIE macrocycles, while G&#8208;2 can increase their fluorescence intensity.







Abstract
Through McMurry coupling reaction, three meso&#8208;position functionalized pillar[5]arene derivatives (H&#8208;1, H&#8208;2, and H&#8208;3) have been successfully prepared by embedding aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens, diphenyldibenzofulvene (DPDBF) and tetraphenylethylene (TPE)) into the skeleton of supramolecular macrocycles. H&#8208;1, bearing [15]paracyclophane ([15]PCP) and DPDBF moiety, exhibits yellow emission and demonstrates obvious AIE effect. In order to further improve the host&#8208;guest properties of this type of structure, H&#8208;2 and H&#8208;3 are prepared by replacing the [15]PCP moiety with pillar[5]arene backbone, both of which show significant AIE effect and excellent host&#8208;guest complexation properties with pyrazine salt guest G&#8208;1 and 1,4&#8208;dicyanobutane G&#8208;2. Our findings indicate that G&#8208;1 can decrease the fluorescence intensity of the AIE macrocycles, while G&#8208;2 can increase their fluorescence intensity in solution.

In order to further improve the host-guest properties of this type of structure, &lt;b&gt;H-2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;H-3&lt;/b&gt; are prepared by replacing the [1&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]PCP moiety with pillar[5]arene backbone, both of which show significant AIE effect and excellent host-guest complexation properties with pyrazine salt guest &lt;b&gt;G-1&lt;/b&gt; and 1,4-dicyanobutane &lt;b&gt;G-2&lt;/b&gt;. Our findings indicate that &lt;b&gt;G-1&lt;/b&gt; can decrease the fluorescence intensity of the AIE macrocycles, while &lt;b&gt;G-2&lt;/b&gt; can increase their fluorescence intensity in solution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>AIE&#8208;doped Poly(Ionic Liquid) Photonic Spheres for the Discrimination of Psychoactive Substances</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high&#8208;degree flexibility and extendibility of introducing various functional anions into the poly(ionic liquid)&#8208;based single sphere sensing platform undoubtedly enable to obtain a huge number of sensing spheres with different properties, together with dual&#8208;channel response mechanism, it shows great potential for high&#8208;efficiency/high&#8208;throughput identification of complicated multi&#8208;analytes.







Abstract
Drugs of abuse has drawn intense attention due to increasing concerns to public health and safety. The construction of a sensing platform with the capability to identify them remains a big challenge because of the limitations of synthetic complexity, sensing scope and receptor extendibility. Here a kind of poly(ionic liquid) (PIL) photonic crystal spheres doped with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogens was developed. As diverse noncovalent interactions involve in PIL moieties, the single sphere shows different binding affinity to a broad range of psychoactive substances. Furthermore, the dual&#8208;channel signals arising from photonic crystal structures and sensitive AIE&#8208;luminogens provide high&#8208;dimensional information for discriminative detection of targets, even for molecules with slight structural differences. More importantly, such single sphere sensing platform could be flexibly customized through ion&#8208;exchange, showing great extendibility to fabricate high&#8208;efficiency/high&#8208;throughput sensing arrays without tedious synthesis.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed 1,3&#8208;Rearrangement of Allylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient Ir(III) dihydride complex catalyzed 1,3&#8208;rearrangement of allylic alcohols was realized, affording the corresponding less easily accessible allylic alcohols regio&#8208; and stereoselectively in high yields from readily available starting materials. The reaction pathway involves a &#960;&#8208;allyl&#8208;Ir(V) intermediate and the dihydride in Ir(III) dihydride complex acts as the hydrogen switch to modulate the valence of iridium center.







Abstract
The allylic alcohol structural motif is prevalent in many important molecules and valuable building blocks. The rearrangement reaction is one of the most important transformations, however there are only a few reports for the 1,3&#8208;rearrangement of allylic alcohols. Herein, a 1,3&#8208;rearrangement of allylic alcohols catalyzed by an Ir(III) dihydride complex is described. This reaction could provide the corresponding less accessible allylic alcohols regio&#8208; and stereoselectively from readily available E/Z mixtures of the substrates. Furthermore, a tandem alkene isomerization followed by 1,3&#8208;rearrangement of homoallylic alcohols was also realized. In addition, this rearrangement reaction could be used to synthesize the natural product Navenone B. Mechanistic investigation indicated that the reaction pathway involved a &#960;&#8208;allyl&#8208;Ir(V) intermediate and that the dihydride in the iridium catalyst acts as a hydrogen switch to modulate the valence of the iridium center.

         <dc:description>
Gearing up ruthenium complexes: Trisindazolylborate tripodal ligands used as ruthenium&#8208;supported rotating cogwheels have been enlarged by functionalizing the indazole moieties with peripheral aryl groups. Based on the single crystal structures, the apparent diameter of the new cogwheels increases of a factor up to 2.0 rendering them suitable for intermolecular gearing motions on surface.







Abstract
This paper reports the synthesis of ruthenium&#8208;based molecular gear prototypes composed of a brominated or non&#8208;brominated pentaphenylcyclopentadienyl ligand as an anchoring unit and a tripodal ligand with aryl&#8208;functionalized indazoles as a rotating cogwheel. Single crystal structures of the ruthenium complexes revealed that the appended aryl groups increase the apparent diameter of the cogwheel rendering them larger than the diameter of the anchoring units and consequently making them suitable for intermolecular gearing motions once the complexes will be adsorbed on a surface.

         <title>Tuning Directed Photooxidation&#8208;Induced Conversion of Pyrrole&#8208;Based Styryl Coumarin Dual&#8208;Color Photoconverters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tuning photoconverter: We have studied the effects of N&#8208;substitution of styryl coumarin pyrrole dyes on their photophysical and photoconversion properties. This study led to an improved version of a dual&#8208;emission photoconverter based on the directed photooxidation&#8208;induced conversion mechanism, which was successfully used in bioimaging with sequential photoconversion of single cells.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;emissive photoconvertible fluorophores (DPCFs) are powerful tools to unambiguously track labeled cells in bioimaging. We recently introduced a new rational mechanism called directed photooxidation&#8208;induced conversion (DPIC) enabling efficient DPCFs to be obtained by conjugating a coumarin to aromatic singlet&#8208;oxygen reactive moieties (ASORMs). Pyrrole was found to be a suitable ASORM as it provided a high hypsochromic shift along with a fast and efficient conversion. By synthesizing various pyrrole&#8208;based styryl coumarin dyes, we showed that the photoconversion properties, including the quantum yield of photoconversion and the chemical yield of conversion can be tuned by chemical modification of the pyrrole. These modifications led to an improved dual emissive converter, SCP&#8722;Boc, which displayed a high brightness and an enhanced photoconversion yield of 63&#8201;%. SCP&#8722;Boc was successfully used to sequentially photoconvert cells by laser scanning confocal microscopy.

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered Control of Glucocerebrosidase Inhibitors: Towards Photoswitchable Pharmacological Chaperones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoactive pairs with stronger affinity for GCase in the light&#8208;activated form than in the thermally&#8208;deactivated one were identified for the development of pharmacological chaperones. The study shows that enantiopure trihydroxypiperidine and azobenzene are key&#8208;units in the inhibition process of human GCase enzyme and that photoswitchable iminosugars bind at an allosteric site.







Abstract
Piperidine&#8208;based photoswitchable derivatives have been developed as putative pharmacological chaperones for glucocerebrosidase (GCase), the defective enzyme in Gaucher disease (GD). The structure&#8208;activity study revealed that both the iminosugar and the light&#8208;sensitive azobenzene are essential features to exert inhibitory activity towards human GCase and a system with the correct inhibition trend (IC50 of the light&#8208;activated form lower than IC50 of the dark form) was identified. Kinetic analyses showed that all compounds are non&#8208;competitive inhibitors (mixed or pure) of GCase and the enzyme allosteric site involved in the interaction was identified by means of MD simulations. A moderate activity enhancement of mutant GCase assessed in GD patients' fibroblasts (ex vivo experiments) carrying the most common mutation was recorded. This promising observation paves the way for further studies to improve the benefit of the light&#8208;to&#8208;dark thermal conversion for chaperoning activity.

To form an ion pair with an imidazolium cation, the base must first &#8220;find&#8221; the substrate, like a pirate who is searching for treasure. The treasure is the acidic proton of the imidazolium cation which will need to be abstracted by the base. The ionic base can effectively approach the cation, while the non&#8208;ionic one wanders off. More information can be found in the Research Article by O. Holl&#243;czki and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203636).

         <title>Crystallization of a Neptunyl Oxalate Hydrate from Solutions Containing NpV and the Uranyl Peroxide Nanocluster U60Ox30</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interactions between U60Ox30 clusters and NpV reveal different mechanisms based on NpV concentrations. Low NpV concentrations cause the clusters to aggregate into larger macrostructures. Higher concentrations of NpV outcompete UVI for coordination with oxalate and lead to cluster dissociation. Neptunyl oxalate crystals and studtite precipitate from cluster remnants.







Abstract
Uranyl peroxide nanoclusters are an evolving family of materials with potential applications throughout the nuclear fuel cycle. While several studies have investigated their interactions with alkali and alkaline earth metals, no studies have probed their interactions with the actinide elements. This work describes a system containing U60Ox30, [((UO2)(O2))60(C2O4)30]60&#8722;, and neptunium(V) as a function of neptunium concentration. Ultra&#8208;small and small angle X&#8208;ray scattering were used to observe these interactions in the aqueous phase, and X&#8208;ray diffraction was used to observe solid products. The results show that neptunium induces aggregation of U60Ox30 when the neptunium concentration is&#8804;10&#8197;mM, whereas (NpO2)2C2O4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6H2O(cr) and studtite ultimately form at 15&#8211;25&#8197;mM neptunium. The latter result suggests that neptunium coordinates with the bridging oxalate ligands in U60Ox30, leaving metastable uranyl peroxide species in solution. This is an important finding given the potential application of uranyl peroxide nanoclusters in the recycling of used nuclear fuel.

         <title>Spin Crossover Induced by Changing the Identity of the Secondary Metal Ion from PdII to NiII in a Face&#8208;Centered FeII8MII6 Cubic Cage
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Changing the identity of the secondary metal ion at the faces of the cage resulted in a spin crossover active material, with the packing effects of the axial acetonitrile ligands providing the steric freedom for structural reconformations associated with spin transition.







Abstract
Discrete spin crossover (SCO) heteronuclear cages are a rare class of materials which have potential use in next&#8208;generation molecular transport and catalysis. Previous investigations of cubic cage [Fe8Pd6L8]28+ constructed using semi&#8208;rigid metalloligands, found that FeII centers of the cage did not undergo spin transition. In this work, substitution of the secondary metal center at the face of the cage resulted in SCO behavior, evidenced by magnetic susceptibility, M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Structural comparisons of these two cages shed light on the possible interplay of inter&#8208; and intramolecular interactions associated with SCO in the NiII analogue, 1 ([Fe8Ni6L8(CH3CN)12]28+). The distorted octahedral coordination environment, as well as the occupation of the CH3CN in the NiII axial positions of 1, prevented close packing of cages observed in the PdII analogue. This led to offset, distant packing arrangements whereby important areas within the cage underwent dramatic structural changes with the exhibition of SCO.

         <title>Highly Selective Monomethylation of Amines with CO2/H2 via Ag/Al2O3 as a Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ag/Al2O3 catalytic controllable synthesis of N&#8208;monomethylated amines by using CO2/H2 as C1 source has been demonstrated in a first example. The reactivity of methylated amines was reduced by the heterolytic dissociation of H2 over the catalyst, and hence conversion of various amines to corresponding monomethylated amines was enabled with excellent selectivity.







Abstract
The selective synthesis of monomethylated amines with CO2 is particularly challenging because the formation of tertiary amines is thermodynamically more favorable. Herein, a new strategy for the controllable synthesis of N&#8208;monomethylated amines from primary amines and CO2/H2 is explored. First&#8208;principle calculations reveal that the dissociation of H2 via an heterolytic route reduces the reactivity of methylated amines and thus inhibit successive methylation. In situ DRIFTS proves the process of formation and decomposition of ammonium salt by secondary amine reversible binding with H+ on the Ag/Al2O3 catalyst, thereby reducing its reactivity. Meanwhile, the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step of monomethylation was much lower than that of overmethylation (0.34&#8197;eV vs. 0.58&#8197;eV) means amines monomethylation in preference to successive methylation. Under optimal reaction conditions, a variety of amines were converted to the corresponding monomethylated amines in good to excellent yields, and more than 90&#8201;% yield of product was obtained.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stimuli&#8208;triggered alterations in biphasic Janus emulsion droplet morphologies enable controllable modulation of the area of surfactant&#8208;functionalized liquid&#8211;liquid interfaces. This effect can be used to induce aggregation&#8208;induced emission from tetraphenylethylene&#8208;functionalized surfactants, yielding a novel stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescent material platform. Here, TPE aggregation and emission on an interface are shown in front of a fluorescence micrograph of the actual system. More information can be found in the Research Article by L. Zeininger and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203790).

         <title>Benzopyrano&#8208;fused phenanthridine based columnar mesogens: Synthesis, self&#8208;organization and charge transport properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Columnar mesogens constitute a fascinating class of supramolecular nano&#8208;architectures owing to the exceptional properties induced by their self&#8208;assembling behavior. Extending the p&#8208;conjugated core in such systems by incorporating hetero atoms extensively influences their mesomorphic, photophysical properies, etc., presenting them as potential candidates for optoelectronic applications. In the present work, a series of novel nitrogen and oxygen&#8208;incorporated chromenonaphthophenanthridine&#8208;based elliptical dimers have been synthesized through tandem Pictet&#8208;Spengler cyclization followed by ipso&#8208;aromatic substitution in one&#8208;pot. Mesophase characterization has been carried out by employing POM, DSC, and X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. Photophysical properties were investigated using UV&#8208;vis and emission spectroscopy. Furthermore, the charge transport properties were analyzed by time&#8208;of&#8208;flight (ToF) measurements, and the observed ambipolar mobilities were found to be of the order of 10&#8208;3 cm2V&#8208;1s&#8208;1. The high solubility, excellent thermal stability, self&#8208;organizing properties, and ambipolar charge transport characteristics make them promising candidates for applications in organic electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>N,N&#8208;Diphenyl Dihydrophenazines: Using &#960;&#8208;Extension to Access Dicationic Multifunctional Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 13, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of &#960;&#8208;extended dihydrophenazines represents a new promising pathway for the stabilization of the radical and dicationic states of these molecules. This could in turn open for brand new applications of this class of molecules in many different fields, from molecular actuators to electrochromic devices.







Abstract
Dihydrophenazines are receiving increasing attention due to applications in numerous fields of chemistry, from light emission to organo&#8208;photocatalysis. Despite this growing interest and numerous works involving the preparation of radical cations based on this scaffold, the isolation and study of the aromatic dications obtained by 2 electron oxidation of dihydrophenazines is still mostly unexplored. From this point of view, along with the substitution at the N atoms generally used to tune dihydrophenazine properties, the &#960;&#8208;extension of the phenazine core could play a crucial role in making dicationic states accessible. This could result in an extension of the knowledge on these elusive dications and in potentially highly interesting applications ranging from material science to molecular actuators.

         <title>IR/UV Double Resonance Study of the 2&#8208;Phenylallyl Radical and its Pyrolysis Products</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 13, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The contribution of the resonance&#8208;stabilized 2&#8208;phenylallyl radical (2&#8208;PA) to molecular growth in a high temperature microreactor is reported in this work. The radical as well as several reaction products were identified by IR/UV ion dip spectroscopy based on their gas&#8208;phase IR signatures, showing that uni&#8208; and bimolecular reactions of 2&#8208;PA are a viable source for PAH formation.







Abstract
Isolated 2&#8208;phenylallyl radicals (2&#8208;PA), generated by pyrolysis from a nitrite precursor, have been investigated by IR/UV ion dip spectroscopy using free electron laser radiation. 2&#8208;PA is a resonance&#8208;stabilized radical that is considered to be involved in the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in combustion, but also in interstellar space. The radical is identified based on its gas&#8208;phase IR spectrum. Furthermore, a number of bimolecular reaction products are identified, showing that the self&#8208;reaction as well as reactions with unimolecular decomposition products of 2&#8208;PA form several PAH efficiently. Possible mechanisms are discussed and the chemistry of 2&#8208;PA is compared with the one of the related 2&#8208;methylallyl and phenylpropargyl radicals.

         <title>Distance&#8208;Triggered Distinct Aryl Migrations on Azidodiboranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 13, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two bis&#8208;haloboranes fused by biphenylene and xanthrene were employed to construct azidodiboranes but resulted in different products. The boron&#8208;boron separation distances were identified as the intrinsic factors for the pathway&#8208;selectivity.







Abstract
Derived from structurally similar precursors, two different azidodiboranes went through distinct aryl migration reactions triggered by different boron&#8208;boron separation distances. Biphenylene based diborane with a shorter boron&#8208;boron distance underwent heterolateral aryl migration to form a seven&#8208;membered azadiborepin, while xanthrene based diborane with a longer boron&#8208;boron distance afforded a stable bis&#8208;azidoborane scaffold. The pyrolysis of such a bis&#8208;azidoborane led to eight&#8208;membered oxazadiborocine through homolateral aryl migration and subsequent [3+2] cycloaddition. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations unveiled that the boron&#8208;boron separation distances were the intrinsic factors for the distinct migrations.

         <title>Alcohols as Efficient Intermolecular Initiators for a Highly Stereoselective Polyene Cyclisation Cascade</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 13, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stereoselective polyene cyclisation cascade was enabled by using HFIP as a solvent. The process is triggered by a cation generated from an alcohol in situ and leads to the formation of three new C&#8208;C bonds and up to five new stereocenters as a single diastereomer. The cyclised products can be derivatised to obtain steroidal analogues in a single step.







Abstract
The use of benzylic and allylic alcohols in HFIP solvent together with Ti(OiPr)4 has been shown to trigger a highly stereoselective polyene cyclisation cascade. Three new carbon&#8208;carbon bonds are made during the process and complete stereocontrol of up to five new stereogenic centers is observed. The reaction is efficient, has high functional group tolerance and is atom&#8208;economic generating water as a stoichiometric by&#8208;product. A new polyene substrate&#8208;class is employed, and subsequent mechanistic studies indicate a stereoconvergent mechanism. The products of this reaction can be used to synthesize steroid&#8208;analogues in a single step.

         <title>A Modular Olefination of Aldehydes with Thiols as Coupling Partners</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 13, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and modular protocol for the olefination of aldehydes with thiols as reaction partners is reported. Olefins with both aromatic and aliphatic substituents were synthesized in high yields and good selectivity via unsymmetric bissulfone intermediates. The E/Z&#8208;selectivity could be switched under kinetic control through the choice of solvent. The use of simple, transition metal&#8208;free reaction conditions and the breadth of substitution patterns that can be accessed render this protocol an attractive addition to the methods available for the de&#8208;novo synthesis of olefins.







Abstract
Olefins range amongst the most important motifs in organic chemistry. Hence, the development of novel olefin syntheses has remained a constant field of research in synthetic chemistry to date. Herein, we report the development of a modular olefination that converts aldehydes into olefins with thiols as reaction partners. The simple, transition metal&#8208;free protocol proceeds via an unsymmetrical bissulfone intermediate which is converted into the respective alkene in a Ramberg&#8208;B&#228;cklund&#8208;type process. Differently substituted olefins can be synthesized from readily available starting materials in typically good yields and stereoselectivities using basic laboratory chemicals exclusively. Complementary reaction conditions differing in the choice of solvent favor the E/Z&#8208;products respectively under kinetic control rendering this protocol an interesting economical addition to the family of olefin syntheses.

         <title>Chiroptical Activity of An Achiral Emissive Eu Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 13, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An achiral Eu&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework and its chiroptical properties both in the ground and excited states. The framework crystallizes in an achiral space ground (Pna21) belonging to the polar point group (mm2). A pair of circular dichroisms (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) peaks with opposite signs were observed for single crystals.







Abstract
Chiroptical activity of achiral crystals is theoretically allowed but very unusual. There is a particularly scarcity of empirical studies on optically active achiral metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). Herein we report an achiral emissive Eu MOF and its chiroptical properties both in the ground and excited states. The framework crystallizes in an achiral space group (Pna21) belonging to the polar point group (mm2), where the asymmetric arrangement of racemic trinuclear Eu&#8208;oxo clusters is responsible for the optical activity. A pair of circular dichroisms (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) peaks with opposite signs were observed for single crystals. Importantly, the luminescence dissymmetry factor can reach up to 1.1&#215;10&#8722;3, which is comparable in magnitude to the value of most of the chiral&#8208;linker&#8208;bridged MOFs. This work gives the first example of achiral MOFs with CPL response and should be instructive for the discovery of more CPL emitters from racemic MOF family.

One pot, many products: A novel method is reported for the general synthesis of spiro&#8208;indenyl 1,4&#8208;benzoxazins and 2&#8208;(2,2&#8208;diarylvinyl)quinoxalines by FeIII&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular cyclization of propargylic alcohols. The hall&#8208;marks of the method are the use of low&#8208;cost substrates and an environmentally benign iron catalyst, high tolerance towards various functional groups, and switchable product formation.







Abstract
We report herein unprecedented cascade reactions of O&#8208;propargyl&#8208;N&#8208;tosyl&#8208;amino phenols with 10&#8197;mol% FeCl3 in DCE at room temperature for 0.67&#8211;3&#8197;h to form spiro&#8208;indenyl 1,4&#8208;benzoxazines with 38&#8211;89&#8201;% yield. Replacing the substrates&#8217; oxygen atom by a N&#8208;tosylimine group followed by treatment with the same catalyst and solvent at 80&#8201;&#176;C produced 2&#8208;(2,2&#8208;diarylvinyl)quinoxalines in 12&#8211;20&#8197;h with up to 62&#8201;% yield. Mechanistic understanding provided an insight into the transformations. The use of simple substrates and an environmentally benign low&#8208;cost catalyst, broad substrate scope and tolerance of diverse functional groups makes the methodology inherently attractive.

         <title>Green&#8208;Emissive Copper Nanocluster with Aggregation&#8208;Enhanced Emission for Selective Detection of Al3+</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 13, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Green&#8208;emissive copper nanoclusters (Cu NCs) were synthesized at a relatively high reaction temperature (80&#8201;&#176;C) and an extended reaction time to 144&#8197;h. The photoluminescence of Cu NCs could be selectively enhanced by adding Al3+, attributed to their aggregation&#8208;enhanced emission features.







Abstract
Selective detection of Al3+ is of great significance both for the benefit of human health and environmental safety considerations. In this work, a sensitive and selective fluorescence assay for Al3+ was proposed based on the green&#8208;emissive Cu nanoclusters (Cu NCs). Different from the commonly reported works, the green emissive Cu NCs showed dual emission bands at 450 and 510&#8197;nm, attributed to the reaction product between polyvinyl pyrrolidone and ascorbic acid and the Cu core, respectively. Al3+ could induce the aggregation of Cu NCs by forming covalent bonds, which results in the enhancement of photoluminescence intensity. This enhancement phenomenon is rather selective to Al3+, which endows the detection in real samples. These results provide new insights for the fluorescence mechanisms of metal NCs, which also provided a functional luminescent material for various applications, such as chemical sensing, bioimaging and photoelectric devices.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclizative Borylation of Allenyl Ketones through Carbene Boryl Migratory Insertion: Access to Densely Substituted Furyl Boronates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 13, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient Pd&#8208;catalyzed cyclizative borylation reaction of allenyl ketones has been developed. The transformation is based on carbene boryl migratory insertion using starting materials that are modularly assembled from raw building blocks. This borylation reaction is a reliable method to synthesize various borylated furans, from which previously hard&#8208;to&#8208;obtain tetra&#8208;substituted furans can be readily obtained.







Abstract
Herein the palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclizative borylation of allenyl ketones with diboron compounds is reported which involves the carbene boryl migratory insertion as the key step. This reaction features mild conditions, good functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope. Thus, it represents an efficient methodology for the assembly of diverse tri&#8208;substituted furyl boronates. In addition, a series of transformations of the resultant multi&#8208;substituted furyl boronates were conducted to provide various densely substituted furan derivatives in good yields, further illustrating the potential synthetic utility of this methodology.

         <title>Triple Thorpe&#8211;Ingold Effect in the Synthesis of 18&#8208;Membered C3 Symmetric Lactams Stacking as Endless Supramolecular Tubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 13, March 1, 2023. </description>

Upon slow injection of the linear H&#8722;[NH&#8722;CHR&#8722;CH2&#8722;CH=CH&#8722;CO]3&#8722;OPfp TFA salt precursors to a solution of NMM at room temperature, the corresponding macrocycles are formed in moderate to excellent yields when the R groups are hydrogen or larger substituents respectively. The resulting symmetric macrolactams stack as endless parallel nanotubes in crystals even when the R groups are increasingly bulky.







Abstract
Three C3 symmetric macrolactams were very efficiently cyclized from their linear precursors. Adequately located substituents are responsible for the enhancement of reactivity that is not observed in the unsubstituted parent. DFT calculations show that the properly folded cyclization precursor, the reactive conformer, is more populated than other conformers, leading to a decrease of free energy of activation. The crystal structure of the ring substituted with three very bulky esters indicates that tubular stacking is preserved.

         <title>N2 Reduction versus H2 Evolution in a Molybdenum&#8208; or Tungsten&#8208;Based Small&#8208;Molecule Model System of Nitrogenase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 13, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selectivity between the reduction of dinitrogen (N2RR) and the evolution of hydrogen (HER) is investigated experimentally and by DFT calculations based on Mo&#8208; and W&#8208;based model systems. Moreover, possible reaction mechanisms for N2RR, as well as for HER, are determined and discussed in detail.







Abstract
Molybdenum dinitrogen complexes have played a major role as catalytic model systems of nitrogenase. In comparison, analogous tungsten complexes have in most cases found to be catalytically inactive. Herein, a tungsten complex was shown to be supported by a pentadentate tetrapodal (pentaPod) phosphine ligand, under conditions of N2 fixation, primarily catalyzes the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), in contrast to its Mo analogue, which catalytically mediates the nitrogen&#8208;reduction reaction (N2RR). DFT calculations were employed to evaluate possible mechanisms and identify the most likely pathways of N2RR and HER activities exhibited by Mo&#8208; and W&#8208;pentaPod complexes. Two mechanisms for N2RR by PCET are considered, starting from neutral (M(0) cycle) and cationic (M(I) cycle) dinitrogen complexes (M=Mo, W). The latter was found to be energetically more favorable. For HER three scenarios are treated; that is, through bimolecular reactions of early M&#8208;NxHy intermediates, pure hydride intermediates or mixed M(H)(NxHy) species.

         <title>The Chelate Effect Rationalizes Observed Rate Acceleration and Enantioselectivity in BINOL&#8208;Catalyzed Petasis Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 13, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,1&#8242;&#8208;Bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol (BINOL) induces high enantiomeric excess of Petasis reaction by forming cyclic B(IV)BINOL intermediates. The chelate formation results in an extraordinary reaction rate acceleration and in the diminishment of the racemic background reaction. An unusual iminium C&#8722;H and O&#8208;BINOL hydrogen bond is responsible for the stereoselectivity. Formation of a cyclic trigonal B(III)BINOL byproduct accompanying the product enables the BINOL catalyst turnover.







Abstract
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations afforded insight into the origin of the experimentally observed reaction rate acceleration (&#8805;500 fold) and enantioselectivity (&#8805;99&#8201;% ee) of 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol&#8208; (BINOL&#8208;) catalyzed three&#8208;component Petasis reactions . BINOL accelerates the rate determining step by forming a BIV chelate, which involves the loss of water from the hemiaminal moiety to generate an iminium intermediate. Subsequent vinyl group transfer from BIV to the iminium carbon affords the enantiomerically enriched product and a cyclic trigonal B(III)BINOL complex, which rapidly releases the BINOL allowing it to re&#8208;enter the catalytic cycle. In the transition state of the vinyl transfer step, C&#8722;H&#8722;O hydrogen bonding between the iminium C&#8722;H and O of (R)&#8208;BINOL directs the vinyl group addition to the Re&#8208;face of the iminium carbon. This mechanism explains both the rate acceleration and high enantioselectivity of the stereo determining step.

         <title>Diarylethene Isomerization by Using Triplet&#8211;Triplet Annihilation Photon Upconversion</title>

         <dc:description>
A single green light source is used to selectively control both the ring&#8208;opening and ring&#8208;closing reactions of diarylethene (DAE) photoswitches, by using green&#8208;to&#8208;blue triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation photon upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC). Whilst using TTA&#8208;UC to trigger the ring&#8208;closing reaction, the green light also induces fluorescence from the colored closed isomer of the DAE, which was used as an in&#8208;situ readout to monitor the isomerization process.







Abstract
Green&#8208;to&#8208;blue triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation photon upconversion with the well&#8208;studied upconversion pair 9,10&#8208;diphenylanthracene (DPA)/platinum octaethylporphyrin (PtOEP) was used to reversibly drive the photoisomerization of diarylethene (DAE) photoswitches by using visible light. By carefully selecting the kinetic and spectral properties of the molecular system as well as the experimental geometry, a single green light source can be used to selectively trigger both the ring&#8208;opening and the ring&#8208;closing reactions, whilst also inducing fluorescence from the colored closed isomer that can be used as a readout to monitor the isomerization process in&#8197;situ. The upconversion solution and the DAE solution are kept physically separated, allowing them to be characterized both concomitantly and individually without further separation processes. The ring&#8208;closing reaction using upconverted photons was quantified and compared to the efficiency of direct isomerization with ultraviolet light.

         <title>Yolk&#8208;shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C Nanocomposites as a Heterogeneous Fenton&#8208;like Catalyst for Organic Dye Removal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 13, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
MB and PMS are absorbed by the Fe3O4/C shell and subsequently diffuse into the interior cavity of the yolk&#8208;shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C nanocomposites. PMS enter the catalyst and interact with active sites on the shell and in the core. Co2+ and Fe2+ in the catalyst can activate PMS to generate SO4&#8901;&#8722;. Meanwhile, OH&#8722;/H2O will be oxidized by SO4&#8901;&#8722; to &#8901;OH, generating H+ while consuming OH&#8722;. SO4&#8901;&#8722;, &#8901;OH and 
, resulting from a typical chain reaction, will interact with MB and breakdown it to intermediates CO2 and H2O.







Abstract
The yolk&#8208;shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C nanocomposites with Co3O4 as the core, Fe3O4/C as the shell, and a cavity structure were synthesized by the hard template method. The physical and chemical properties of the composites were characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD, TGA, XPS, BET, and VSM. The specific surface area of yolk&#8208;shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C nanocomposites is 175.9&#8197;m2&#8197;g&#8722;1, showing superparamagnetic properties. The yolk&#8208;shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C nanocomposites were used as heterogeneous Fenton catalysts to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to degrade MB, which showed high catalytic degradation performance. The degradation rate of MB reached 100&#8201;% within 30&#8197;min under the circumstances of the yolk&#8208;shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C nanocomposites dosage of 0.1&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1, the PMS dosage of 1.0&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1, the initial MB concentration of 100&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1, an initial pH of 5.5, and a temperature of 30&#177;2&#8201;&#176;C. The enhanced catalytic performance of the yolk&#8208;shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C nanocomposites can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the two catalytically active materials and the middle cavity. The effects of different operating parameters and co&#8208;existing anion species on MB degradation were also investigated. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis and quenching experiments confirmed that the formation of SO4&#8901;&#8722; in the yolk&#8208;shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C/PMS system contributes to MB degradation. In addition, yolk&#8208;shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C nanocomposites can be easily separated from the pollutant solution under the action of an external magnetic field, and the degradation rate of MB can still reach 98&#8201;% after five cycles, indicating that it has good stability and reusability and has broad application prospects in the field of water purification.

&lt;p&gt;MB and PMS are absorbed by the Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/C shell and subsequently diffuse into the interior cavity of the yolk-shell Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/C nanocomposites. PMS enter the catalyst and interact with active sites on the shell and in the core. Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in the catalyst can activate PMS to generate SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. Meanwhile, OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O will be oxidized by SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to &#8901;OH, generating H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; while consuming OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, &#8901;OH and 
, resulting from a typical chain reaction, will interact with MB and breakdown it to intermediates CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.

         <title>Bifunctional Ru&#8208;Cluster&#8208;Decorated Co3B&#8722;Co(OH)2 Hybrid Catalyst Synergistically Promotes NaBH4 Hydrolysis and Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 13, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic synergy: A well&#8208;dispersed Ru&#8208;nanocluster&#8208;decorated Co3B&#8722;Co(OH)2 hybrid catalyst is constructed by steps of electroless plating, calcination and chemical reduction methods. The resulting catalyst exhibits excellent NaBH4 hydrolysis and electrocatalytic HER activity, which is mainly attributed to the synergistic effect of Ru clusters with Co3B&#8722;Co(OH)2, and the large surface area exposed more active sites.







Abstract
Developing a highly efficient bifunctional catalyst for hydrolysis of metal hydrides and spontaneous hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is essential for substituting conventional fuels for H2 production. Herein, Ru&#8208;cluster&#8208;modified Co3B&#8722;Co(OH)2 supported on nickel foam (Ru/Co3B&#8722;Co(OH)2@NF) is constructed by electroless deposition, calcination and chemical reduction. The catalyst exhibits an excellent hydrogen generation rate (HGR) of 4989&#8197;mL&#8201;min&#8722;1 
 and good reusability, superior to most previously reported catalysts. Besides, Ru/Co3B&#8722;Co(OH)2@NF displays a prominent hydrogen evolution reaction catalytic capability with a low overpotential of 153.0&#8197;mV at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (50.5&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), a small Tafel slope of 40.0&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 and long&#8208;term stability (100&#8197;h@10&#8201;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) in 1.0&#8197;M KOH. The excellent catalytic H2 generation capacity benefits from the rapid charge transfer promoted by metallic Co3B, the synergistic catalytic effect of Co3B&#8722;Co(OH)2 and Ru clusters, and the unique composite structure favorable for solute transport and gas emission.

         <title>Photocatalytic Synthesis of Acetals and Ketals from Aldehydes and Silylenolethers without the Use of Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 13, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Use light instead of acids: Silylenolethers derived from aldehydes and ketones as well as aldehydes themselves react efficiently to give acetals in good to excellent yields. The substrate range with respect to both aldehydes and alcohols is broad, and acid&#8208; and hydrogen&#8208;labile protecting groups are tolerated.







Abstract
Acetals and ketals are among the most important protecting groups for carbonyl compounds. A new method for acetalization and ketalization by means of photoredox catalysis has been developed. A biscyanolated perylene bisimide is used as an electron&#8208;poor photocatalyst, together with green light (525&#8197;nm LED). Silylenolethers derived from aldehydes react efficiently to give acetals in good to excellent yields. A broad substrate range was shown with respect to both the aldehydes and the alcohols. The functional group tolerance is high; in particular, acid&#8208; and hydrogen&#8208;labile protecting groups are tolerated. Aldehydes can also be directly and selectively converted into the respective acetals. Only ketones must be converted to their silylenolethers before ketalization. This photocatalytic method works without any use of acids or photoacids, and does not need any additives or H&#8208;atom transfer reagents. Hence, it broadens the substrate scope and repertoire of photoredox catalysis with respect to carbonyl chemistry.

         <title>Controlled Hydrolysis of Phosphate Esters: A Route to Calixarene&#8208;Supported Rare&#8208;Earth Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 13, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ln&#8208;based controlled hydrolysis in a phosphorylated&#8208;calix[4]arene results in the cleavage of three out of the eight P&#8722;OEt bonds, forming a hydrolyzed phosphoryl&#8208;calix[4]arene ligand (H3LHPO). The chelating nature of H3LHPO traps the LnIII species in the form of [LnIII(LHPO)((EtO)2P(O)OH)]2 (Ln=La, Dy, Tb, Gd), with the Dy derivative showing slow relaxation of the magnetization.







Abstract
Phosphate ester bonds are widely present in nature (e.&#8201;g. DNA/RNA) and can be extremely stable against hydrolysis without the help of catalysts. Previously, we showed how the combination of phosphoryl and calix[4]arene moieties in the same organic framework (LPO) allows isolation of single lanthanide (Ln) metal ions as [LnIII(LPO)2](O3SCF3)3. Here we report how by controlling the reaction conditions a new hydrolyzed phosphoryl&#8208;calix[4]arene ligand (H3LHPO) is formed as a result of LnIII&#8208;mediated P&#8211;OEt bond cleavage in three out of the eight possible sites in LPO. The chelating nature of H3LHPO traps the LnIII species in the form of [LnIII(LHPO)((EtO)2P(O)OH)]2 dimers (Ln=La, Dy, Tb, Gd), where the Dy derivative shows slow magnetization relaxation. The strategy presented herein could be extended to access a broader library of hydrolyzed platforms (HxLHPO; x=1&#8211;8) that may represent mimics of nuclease enzymes.

The chelating nature of H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;HPO&lt;/sub&gt; traps the Ln&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; species in the form of [Ln&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(L&lt;sub&gt;HPO&lt;/sub&gt;)((EtO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P(O)OH)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dimers (Ln=La, Dy, Tb, Gd), where the Dy derivative shows slow magnetization relaxation. The strategy presented herein could be extended to access a broader library of hydrolyzed platforms (H&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;HPO&lt;/sub&gt;; &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;=1&#8211;8) that may represent mimics of nuclease enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Simultaneous Pore Space Partition and Multi&#8208;Step Core Expansion: An integration of core&#8208;expansion and pore&#8208;space partition strategies leads to simultaneous increase in C2H2 uptake capacity and C2H2/CO2 selectivity.







Abstract
A multi&#8208;stage core&#8208;expansion method is proposed here as one component of the integrative binding&#8208;site/extender/core&#8208;expansion (BEC) strategy. The conceptual deconstruction of the partitioning ligand into three editable parts draws our focus onto progressive core expansion and allows the optimization of both acetylene uptake and selectivity. The effectiveness of this strategy is shown through a family of eight cationic pore&#8208;partitioned materials containing three different partitioning ligands and various counter anions. The optimized structure, Co3&#8208;cpt&#8208;tph&#8208;Cl (Hcpt=4&#8208;(p&#8208;carboxyphenyl)&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole, H&#8208;tph=(2,5,8&#8208;tri&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3,4,6,7,9&#8208;hexaazaphenalene) with the largest surface area and highest C2H2 uptake capacity (200&#8197;cm3/g at 298&#8197;K), also exhibits (desirably) the lowest CO2 uptake and hence the highest C2H2/CO2 selectivity. The successful boost in both C2H2 capacity and IAST selectivity allows Co3&#8208;cpt&#8208;tph&#8208;Cl to rank among the best crystalline porous materials, ionic MOFs in particular, for C2H2 uptake and C2H2/CO2 experimental breakthrough separation.

         <title>B(C6F5)3&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective Ring Opening of Cyclic Amines with Hydrosilanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 13, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strong boron Lewis acid B(C6F5)3 in combination with phenylsilane enables the regioselective cleavage of one out of two or three carbon&#8211;nitrogen bonds in cyclic secondary and tertiary amines, respectively. This amine deconstruction extends to large saturated nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, and the functional&#8208;group tolerance is good.







Abstract
Opening the ring of cyclic amines by regioselective fission of one of the carbon&#8211;nitrogen bonds greatly expands the repertoire of available nitrogen&#8208;containing skeletons. Unlike approaches starting from cyclic tertiary amines, methods that can directly open secondary amines are still scarce. The present work discloses an efficient reductive ring opening of either of these cyclic amines using PhSiH3 under B(C6F5)3 catalysis. By this, the direct transformation of unstrained cyclic amines into the corresponding acyclic amines is achieved in a simple one&#8208;pot operation. A stepwise mechanism proceeding through the intermediacy of silylammonium ions followed by reductive cleavage of a carbon&#8211;nitrogen bond was experimentally verified.

Single&#8208;molecule magnets: This work demonstrated the creation of ferromagnetic SMMs by magnetic dipole engineering of di&#8208;nuclear metal ion centers, which represents a new insight to create ferromagnetic 3d&#8208;transition&#8208;metal SMMs.







Abstract
Di&#8208;nuclear citrate complexes, [CH6N3]2[M2(citH)2(H2O)4]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O (citH4=citric acid; M=FeII (Fe&#8208;2), CoII (Co&#8208;2), and NiII (Ni&#8208;2)), are synthesized. The ligand, citH3&#8722;, is deprotonated only at the three carboxy groups, which is different from the previously reported tetra&#8208;nuclear structures with cit4&#8722; ligands. Magnetic measurements reveal that these complexes have intramolecular ferromagnetism with J=&#8764;0&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (Ni&#8208;2), 0.02&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (Co&#8208;2), and 0.04&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (Fe&#8208;2). Co&#8208;2 and Fe&#8208;2 show slow magnetic relaxation, and are field&#8208;induced SMMs with activation energy of spin&#8208;reversal Ueff=27&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (Co&#8208;2) and 4.2&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (Fe&#8208;2). Density functional theory calculations indicate that the uniaxial anisotropy along the z&#8208;axis of each metal ion center forms the pseudo&#8208;serial arrangement, leading to intramolecular ferromagnetism via the magnetic dipole interaction. This work demonstrates the creation of ferromagnetic SMMs by the magnetic dipole engineering of 3d di&#8208;nuclear metal ion centers.

         <title>Live Monitoring of Anionic Living Polymerizations by Electrospray&#8208;Ionization Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 13, March 1, 2023. </description>

Perusing polymerization: Electrospray&#8208;ionization mass spectrometry permits the in&#8208;situ monitoring of living anionic polymerizations. Analysis of the time evolution of the observed molar mass distributions affords rate constants for the individual propagation steps and gives unique insight into the mechanism of the polymerization reaction.







Abstract
Anionic polymerizations are of exceptional practical importance, but difficult to analyze due to the high reactivity of the growing polymer chains. Here, we demonstrate that electrospray&#8208;ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) permits direct observation of the active carbanionic intermediates formed in the anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization of 1&#8208;cyanocyclopropanecarboxylate in tetrahydrofuran. This includes the identification of a side product, as well as real&#8208;time analysis of the polymerization reaction. From the mass spectra obtained, we can derive not only the mean molar mass and the polydispersity, but also the rate constants for the initiation and the individual propagation steps. The initiation proceeds significantly faster than the propagation steps. Accordingly, the examined reaction corresponds to a living polymerization, as we also confirmed by additional control experiments. Besides giving detailed insight into the reaction system probed here, we also expect the presented methodology to make possible the in&#8208;situ analysis of further anionic polymerizations.

Here, we demonstrate that electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) permits direct observation of the active carbanionic intermediates formed in the anionic ring-opening polymerization of 1-cyanocyclopropanecarboxylate in tetrahydrofuran. This includes the identification of a side product, as well as real-time analysis of the polymerization reaction. From the mass spectra obtained, we can derive not only the mean molar mass and the polydispersity, but also the rate constants for the initiation and the individual propagation steps. The initiation proceeds significantly faster than the propagation steps. Accordingly, the examined reaction corresponds to a living polymerization, as we also confirmed by additional control experiments. Besides giving detailed insight into the reaction system probed here, we also expect the presented methodology to make possible the in-situ analysis of further anionic polymerizations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhanced Photocatalytic Activity of Hyper&#8208;Cross&#8208;Linked Polymers Toward Amines Oxidation Coupled with H2O2 Generation through Extending Monomer's Conjugation Degree</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 13, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extending the monomer's conjugation degree of HCPs photocatalysts could significantly promote the separation and transfer efficiency of photogenerated carriers. QP&#8208;HCPs bring out the best photocatalytic activity for amines oxidation coupled with H2O2 generation due to its maximum monomer's conjugation degree and excellent O2 adsorption capacity.







Abstract
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven amines oxidation coupled with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation is a promising way to convert solar energy to chemical energy. Herein, a series of hyper&#8208;cross&#8208;linked polymers (HCPs) photocatalysts with different arenes monomers, including benzene (BE), diphenyl (DP), p&#8208;terphenyl (TP), or p&#8208;quaterphenyl (QP), were synthesized by simple Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation reaction. Owing to the maximum monomer's conjunction degree and excellent oxygen (O2) adsorption capacity, QP&#8208;HCPs exhibited highest photocatalytic activity for benzylamine oxidation coupled with H2O2 generation under the irradiation of 455&#8197;nm Blue LED lamp. More than 99&#8201;% of benzylamine could be converted to N&#8208;benzylidenebenzylamine within 60&#8197;min. In addition, nearly stoichiometric H2O2 was synchronously obtained with a high production rate of 9.3&#8197;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. Our work not only demonstrated that the photocatalytic activity of HCPs photocatalysts significantly depends on monomer's conjunction degree, but also provided a new strategy for converting solar energy to chemical energy.

A copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed interrupted domino reaction of 2&#8208;azido sulfoximines with 1&#8208;iodoalkynes affords fused triazolyl&#8208;containing benzothiadiazine&#8208;1&#8208;oxides in good to excellent yields.

Abstract
Copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed domino reactions of 2&#8208;azido sulfoximines with 1&#8208;iodoalkynes yield fused triazolyl&#8208;containing benzothiadiazine&#8208;1&#8208;oxides. The protocol features the synthesis of two fused heterocyclic rings in one step with good to excellent yields and a broad functional group tolerance. Detailed mechanistic investigations indicate that a copper &#960;&#8208;complex initiates a cycloaddition and oxidative C&#8722;N coupling reaction sequence. The results suggest an interrupted domino process involving an iodinated triazole as a key intermediate.

         <title>POM@ZIF Derived Mixed Metal Oxide Catalysts for Sustained Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 13, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile chemical route to convert POM&#8208;doped ZIF 67 to carbon&#8208;supported mixed metal oxides gives access to a noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free OER catalyst featuring high specific surface area, high stability, and high OER activity.







Abstract
The design of efficient and stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts based on noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free materials is crucial for energy conversion and storage. In this work, it was demonstrated how polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;67 can be converted into a stable oxygen evolution electrocatalyst by chemical etching, cation exchange, and thermal annealing steps. Characterization by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy indicate that POM&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;67 derived carbon&#8208;supported metal oxides were synthesized. The resulting composite shows structural and compositional advantages which lead to low overpotential (306&#8197;mV at j=10&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and long&#8208;term stability under harsh OER conditions (1.0&#8197;M aqueous KOH).

         <title>Direct Observation of Charge, Energy, and Hydrogen Transfer between the Backbone and Nucleobases in Isolated DNA Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 13, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphorus atoms were targeted in the backbone of gas&#8208;phase oligonucleotide anions and cations, by means of resonant photoabsorption at the L&#8208; and K&#8208;edges. The ionic photoproducts of the excitation process were studied by a combination of mass spectrometry and X&#8208;ray spectroscopy. Charge and/or energy as well as H transfer from the backbone to nucleobases was directly observed and investigated.







Abstract
Understanding how charge and energy, as well as protons and hydrogen atoms, are transferred in molecular systems as a result of an electronic excitation is fundamental for understanding the interaction between ionizing radiation and biological matter on the molecular level. To localize the excitation at the atomic scale, it was chosen to target phosphorus atoms in the backbone of gas&#8208;phase oligonucleotide anions and cations, by means of resonant photoabsorption at the L&#8208; and K&#8208;edges. The ionic photoproducts of the excitation process were studied by a combination of mass spectrometry and X&#8208;ray spectroscopy. The combination of absorption site selectivity and photoproduct sensitivity allowed the identification of X&#8208;ray spectral signatures of specific processes. Moreover, charge and/or energy as well as H transfer from the backbone to nucleobases has been directly observed. Although the probability of one versus two H transfer following valence ionization depends on the nucleobase, ionization of sugar or phosphate groups at the carbon K&#8208;edge or the phosphorus L&#8208;edge mainly leads to single H transfer to protonated adenine. Moreover, our results indicate a surprising proton&#8208;transfer process to specifically form protonated guanine after excitation or ionization of P 2p electrons.

The site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H oxygenation of alkyl chains as well as deactivated positions remains a great challenge for chemists. Here, we report the synthesis and application of four new supramolecular tweezer&#8208;based oxidation catalysts. They consist of the well&#8208;explored M(pdp/mcp) oxidation moiety and a molecular tweezer capable of binding ammonium salts. All catalysts display preferential oxidation of the strongly deactivated C3/C4 positions, however to different degrees. Furthermore, the best performing catalyst Fe(pdp)Twe was explored with an expanded substrate scope. It was demonstrated that the deactivated positions C3/C4 are also preferentially oxidized in these cases.

A low&#8208;cost and environmentally benign iron(III) catalyst triggers a novel cascade reaction paving the way to synthesize various heterocycles and spirocycles. Appropriate design of substrates by using simple starting materials could provide access to biologically and synthetically useful products as depicted through the generation of exquisite alpana art decorated with simple flowers. The putative mechanistic cycle represented herein tries to shed some light on the inherent chemistry involved with this methodology. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. De and C. Chowdhury (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203993).

         <dc:description>
The photoredox catalytic cycle with an electron&#8208;deficient perylene bisimide (PBI) runs as long as green light is provided. The substrate silylenolethers and aldehydes enter the cycle, are oxidized to their radical cations and converted to acetals and ketals, which leave the cycle as products. Acid catalysts are not needed. Ketal and acetal groups protect the carbonyl compounds like helmets. More information can be found in the Research Article by H.&#8208;A. Wagenknecht and D.

The reconstruction of transition metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts during water oxidation has become a common understanding. The obtained metal (oxy)hydroxide layers derived from surface reconstruction process usually show much higher electrocatalytic performance than the directed synthesized (oxy)hydroxide counterparts, highlighting the key role of interaction between substrate materials and surface reconstructed active species. Read more about reconstructed chemistry and substrate effect in transition metal&#8208;based OER electrocatalysts in the Review article by W. Luo et&#8197;al.







Abstract
The development of electrocatalysts with high&#8208;efficiency and clear structure&#8208;activity relationship towards the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is essential for the wide application of water electrolyzers. Recently, the dynamic reconstruction phenomenon of the catalysts&#8217; surface structures during the OER process has been discovered. With the help of various advanced ex situ and in situ characterization, it is demonstrated that such surface reconstruction could yield actual active species to catalyze the water oxidation process.

     alt="Reconstructured Electrocatalysts during Oxygen Evolution Reaction under Alkaline Electrolytes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The reconstruction of transition metal-based electrocatalysts&lt;/b&gt; during water oxidation has become a common understanding. The obtained metal (oxy)hydroxide layers derived from surface reconstruction process usually show much higher electrocatalytic performance than the directed synthesized (oxy)hydroxide counterparts, highlighting the key role of interaction between substrate materials and surface reconstructed active species. Read more about reconstructed chemistry and substrate effect in transition metal-based OER electrocatalysts in the Review article by W. Luo et&#8197;al.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of electrocatalysts with high-efficiency and clear structure-activity relationship towards the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is essential for the wide application of water electrolyzers. Recently, the dynamic reconstruction phenomenon of the catalysts&#8217; surface structures during the OER process has been discovered. With the help of various advanced ex situ and in situ characterization, it is demonstrated that such surface reconstruction could yield actual active species to catalyze the water oxidation process. However, the attention and studies of potential interaction between reconstructed species and substrate are lacking. This review summarizes the recent development of typical reconstructed electrocatalysts and the substrate effect. First, the advanced characterization for electrocatalytic reconstruction is briefly discussed. Then, typical reconstructed electrocatalysts are comprehensively summarized and the key role of substrate effects during the OER process is emphasized. Finally, the future challenges and perspectives of surface reconstructed catalysts for water electrolysis are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Stereospecific On&#8208;Surface Dimerization into Bishelicenes: Topochemical Ullmann Coupling of Bromohelicene on Au(111)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The on&#8208;surface dimerization into bis(hexahelicene) on a gold(111) surface has been studied by means of scanning tunneling microscopy and time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary mass spectrometry. C&#8211;C Ullmann coupling of (rac)&#8208;2&#8208;bromo&#8208;hexahelicene leads to formation of the (M,M)&#8208; and (P,P)&#8208; diastereomers of 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bis(hexahelicene), whilst formation of the (M,P)&#8208;diastereomer is not observed. Upon cooling, the bis(hexahelicene) aggregates into an ordered two&#8208;dimensional lattice with partly randomly distributed enantiomers. The highly specific diastereomeric coupling is explained by the surface alignment of educt in combination with the strong steric overcrowding in a possible surface&#8208;confined (M,P)&#8208;product.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoluminescent Properties and Mechanism of Novel Cyanine&#8208;Borondifluoride Curcuminoid Hybrids as Red to Near&#8208;Infrared and Endoplasmic Reticulum&#8208;Targeting Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis&#8208;oriented design led us to the discovery of a series of novel cyanine&#8208;borondifluoride curcuminoid hybrids called Nanchang Red (NCR) dyes, which overcome the intrinsic low synthetic yields of symmetrical cyanine&#8208;difluoroboronate (BF2) hybridized NIR dyes. The hybridization endows NCR dyes with high molar extinction coefficients, efficient red to NIR emissions, and enlarged Stokes shifts. Quantum chemical calculations revealed that the asymmetrical layout of the three key electron&#8208;withdrawing and electron&#8208;donating fragments results in a special pattern of partial charge separation and inconsistent charge delocalization degrees on their &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbones. While the nature of the hemicyanine fragment exerts significant influence on the excitation modes of NCR dyes, the borondifluoride hemicurcuminoid fragment is the major contributor to the enlarged Stokes shifts. Cell imaging experiments illustrated that a subtle change of N&#8208;heterocycle of the hemicyanine fragment remarkably affects the subcellular localization of NCR dyes. Unlike other previously reported cyanine&#8208;BF2 hybridized dyes, which mainly target mitochondria, the benzothiazole and indole&#8208;based NCR dyes accumulate in both the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and lipid droplets (LDs) of HeLa cells, whereas the benzoxazole and quinoline&#8208;based NCR dyes stain the ER specifically.</dc:description>

         <title>Substituent Effects in Bioorthogonal Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions of 1,2,4,5&#8208;Tetrazines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,2,4,5&#8208;Tetrazines are increasingly used reactants in bioorthogonal chemistry due to their high reactivity in Diels&#8211;Alder reactions with various dienophiles. Substituents in 3&#8208; and 6&#8208;position of the tetrazine scaffold are known to have a significant impact on the rate of cycloadditions which is commonly explained on the basis of frontier molecular orbital theory. In contrast, we show that reactivity differences between commonly used classes of tetrazines are not controlled by frontier molecular orbital interactions. In particular, we demonstrate that mono&#8208;substituted tetrazines show high reactivity due to decreased Pauli repulsion that leads to a more asynchronous approach associated with reduced distortion energy. This follows the recent Vermeeren&#8211;Hamlin&#8211;Bickelhaupt model of reactivity increase in asymmetric Diels&#8211;Alder reactions. In addition, we reveal that ethylene is not a good model compound for other alkenes in Diels&#8211;Alder reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystalline Order Propagates Across Thick Layers of Water in Solutions of Supramolecular Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>3D crystalline order with 1 nm resolution is observed in aqueous solutions of supramolecular nanotubes containing 94% water, at concentrations as low as 6 wt%. 50 of star&#8208;like organic ions arrange into supramolecular rings which, in turn, stack on top of each other to form long hollow tubes with 15 nm outer diameter. Cryo&#8208;TEM and X&#8208;ray diffraction show that the parallel nanotubes arrange on a perfect hexagonal lattice. Unexpectedly, fiber diffraction on sheared solutions revealed numerous hkl Bragg reflections on several layer lines indicating longitudinal interlock between the tubes and 3D crystalline order with molecular&#8208;scale details transferred across 10 nm thick layers of water. The observed high 3D order is attributed to long&#8208;range attraction between like&#8208;charged tubes and amplified charge modulation by the extremely high intra&#8208;tube correlation length.</dc:description>

Cryo-TEM and X-ray diffraction show that the parallel nanotubes arrange on a perfect hexagonal lattice. Unexpectedly, fiber diffraction on sheared solutions revealed numerous hkl Bragg reflections on several layer lines indicating longitudinal interlock between the tubes and 3D crystalline order with molecular-scale details transferred across 10 nm thick layers of water. The observed high 3D order is attributed to long-range attraction between like-charged tubes and amplified charge modulation by the extremely high intra-tube correlation length.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;supported&#160;Ru&#8208;incorporated NiSe2 for ampere&#8208;level current density hydrogen evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To meet the requirements for industrial water splitting to generate hydrogen, it is urgent, but still quite challenging to develop highly active and stable electrocatalysts for large&#8208;current&#8208;density hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, Ru&#8208;incorporated NiSe2 (Ru&#8208;NiSe2) was designed and synthesized. The introduction of Ru results in the formation of hierarchically structured Ru&#8208;NiSe2 with large electrochemical active surface area, and well&#8208;modified electronic structure. As expected, the as&#8208;fabricated Ru&#8208;NiSe2 displays impressive HER activity in 1.0 M KOH, with a low overpotential of 180.8 mV to reach the current density of 1000 mA cm&#8722;2. Ru&#8208;NiSe2 also presents outstanding long&#8208;term stability at high current densities, owing to its high intrinsic chemical stability, and strong catalyst&#8208;support interface. Notably, when performed at a certain current density of 1000 mA cm&#8722;2, the overpotential increase after 90 hours is only 13 mV. Such excellent HER performance of Ru&#8208;NiSe2 demonstrates its great potential for practical use in industrial water splitting.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper activation enables reversible aqueous Cu&#8208;ZnS battery chemistries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The aqueous metal&#8208;sulfide batteries (AMSBs) have attracted research interest due to their high capacity, rich raw materials, and environmental protection. However, the design strategies for metal sulfide cathode have rarely been reported. Here, the copper&#8208;activated sphalerite in which Zn2+ is substituted by Cu2+ through ion exchange have been introduced as cathode for aqueous Cu/ZnS batteries firstly. After sphalerite transformed to CuS, a two&#8208;step conversion of CuS&#8594;Cu7S4&#8594;Cu2S storage mechanism has been proposed. At 0.7 A g&#8208;1 current density, the capacity can reach 532.4 mAh g&#8208;1 after 100 cycles. When cycled once at a current density of 35 mA g&#8208;1, the initial reversible capacity can reach 461 mAh g&#8208;1 under 1 A g&#8208;1. Furthermore, the assembled Zn//ZnS hybrid ion cell deliver an energy of up to 460 Wh kg&#8208;1, which is better than many AMSBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Nonmetallic Nitrogen&#8208;Doped MnO2 as Highly Efficient Oxygen Electrocatalyst for Rechargeable Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;MnO2 was synthesis at mild annealing temperature in 2&#8197;vol&#8201;% NH3 atmospheres. While avoiding the formation of Mn3O4, the introduction of Mn3+ and Vo by N doping improves the surface areas and enhances charge transfer property of catalysts, leading to outstanding bifunctional performance for ORR and OER.







Abstract
Zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) have been considered as one of the most promising energy storage devices to solve the problem of energy crisis and environmental pollution. In this work, we reported the synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;doped MnO2 (N&#8208;MnO2) to replace the noble metal electrocatalysts for air cathode in ZABs. The doped N atoms here introduced more Mn3+ and oxygen vacancies for MnO2, enhancing charge transfer property and accelerating surface intermediate product during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Hence, the best N&#8208;MnO2 achieved remarkable electrocatalytic activities towards ORR (half&#8208;wave potential of 0.797&#8197;V vs. RHE), and reversible oxygen overpotential of around 0.842&#8197;V, which is better than or comparable to the Pt/C and Mn&#8208;based catalysts reported recently. Moreover, the homemade ZABs based on N&#8208;MnO2 showed the maximum power density of 132.8&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and excellent cyclic stability.

Ultrathin Two&#8208;Dimensional BiOCl&#8208;Bi2S3&#8208;Cu2S Ternary Heterostructures with Enhanced LSPR effect for NIR Photonic Bacterial Disinfection (Chen, Yang, et&#8197;al.).







Abstract
Abstract: Photonic disinfection, particularly near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light triggered antibacterial, has emerged as a highly promising solution for combating pathogenic microbes due to its spatiotemporal operability, safety, and low cost of apparatus. However, it remains challenging to construct NIR&#8208;responsive antibacterial agents with high light&#8208;converting efficacy and elucidate synergistic mechanisms. In this work, ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) BiOCl&#8208;Bi2S3&#8208;Cu2S ternary heterostructures that can efficiently kill drug&#8208;resistant bacteria were synthesized by doping 0D Bi2S3 and Cu2S nanoparticles in the 2D BiOCl nanosheets via a facile one&#8208;pot hydrothermal method. Notably, the incorporation of Cu2S nanoparticles bestows strong NIR light&#8208;harvesting capability to the composite nanosheets due to their localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). Upon NIR light illumination, the BiOCl&#8208;Bi2S3&#8208;Cu2S nanosheets can achieve enhanced photonic hyperthermia and reaction oxygen species (ROS) generation, serving as single light&#8208;activated bi&#8208;functional photothermal/photodynamic therapeutics. High&#8208;speed hot electrons and large local electronic fields caused by LSPR might play an important role in thermal vibrations and effective carrier separations, respectively. Benefiting from the unique ternary heterostructures, both the photothermal conversion and ROS generation efficacy of BiOCl&#8208;Bi2S3&#8208;Cu2S nanosheets are significantly improved compared to the binary BiOCl&#8208;Cu2S or BiOCl&#8208;Bi2S3 nanosheets. Accordingly, the ternary composite nanosheets can effectively kill bacteria via the NIR&#8208;driven photonic disinfection mechanism. This work presents a new type of 2D composite nanosheets with ternary heterostructures for NIR photonic disinfection.

         <title>Destruction of a Copper Metal&#8211;Organic Framework to Induce CuPt Growth as a Heterojunction Catalyst for Hydrogen Peroxide Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Partially thermal reduction and galvanic replacement proved to be a fascinating method to induce CuPt growth on CuHHTP MOF in order to achieve CuPt@CuHHTP heterojunction. It was discovered that the size of CuPt nanoparticles can be effectively regulated by the reduction temperature. The resultant CuPt NP@CuHHTP heterojunction nanoarrays were used to construct an enzyme&#8208;free electrochemical sensor of H2O2, which exhibited outstanding H2O2 sensing performance.







Abstract
Assembling bimetallic alloys (BAs) with metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) to form heterojunctions has emerged as a promising strategy for the construction of highly active electrocatalysts. However, the current approaches to prepare BA@MOF heterojunctions suffer from poor controllability. In this work, a fascinating method involving partial thermal reduction and galvanic replacement to induce CuPt growth on a CuHHTP MOF (HHTP=2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene) is reported in order to construct a CuPt@CuHHTP heterojunction. The size of the CuPt nanoparticles can be effectively regulated by modifying the reduction temperature. The resultant CuPt NP@CuHHTP heterojunction nanoarrays exhibit high electrocatalytic activity and potential as an electrochemical H2O2 sensor with a low detection limit (5&#8197;nM), high sensitivity (6.942&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mM&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2), and outstanding selectivity. This in situ approach provides not only new insights into the preparation of BA@MOF&#8208;based heterojunctions but also an effective approach for the optimization of the catalytic performance of MOFs and related materials.

The resultant CuPt NP@CuHHTP heterojunction nanoarrays were used to construct an enzyme-free electrochemical sensor of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which exhibited outstanding H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sensing performance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assembling bimetallic alloys (BAs) with metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) to form heterojunctions has emerged as a promising strategy for the construction of highly active electrocatalysts. However, the current approaches to prepare BA@MOF heterojunctions suffer from poor controllability. In this work, a fascinating method involving partial thermal reduction and galvanic replacement to induce CuPt growth on a CuHHTP MOF (HHTP=2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene) is reported in order to construct a CuPt@CuHHTP heterojunction. The size of the CuPt nanoparticles can be effectively regulated by modifying the reduction temperature. The resultant CuPt NP@CuHHTP heterojunction nanoarrays exhibit high electrocatalytic activity and potential as an electrochemical H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sensor with a low detection limit (5&#8197;nM), high sensitivity (6.942&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mM&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and outstanding selectivity. This in situ approach provides not only new insights into the preparation of BA@MOF-based heterojunctions but also an effective approach for the optimization of the catalytic performance of MOFs and related materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selectivity in Cationic Cyclizations Involving Alkynes: A Computational Study on the Biomimetic Synthesis of Steroids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inside out: Computational analysis of electrophilic cyclization reactions involving terminal or internal alkynes and electrophilic centers (cations and Lewis&#8208;acid&#8208;activated epoxides) provide insights into the different interactions that determine the 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig or 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig regioselectivity of terminal and internal alkynes, respectively.







Abstract
Computational studies on the electrophilic cyclization between alkynes and transient carbocations or Lewis&#8208;acid&#8208;activated epoxides show that the regiochemistry of the reaction depends on the terminal or internal position of the triple bond. Reactants possessing terminal alkynyl groups lead to six&#8208;membered rings, whereas internal alkynes yield five&#8208;membered rings through 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig and 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig electrophilic cyclizations, respectively. The regiochemistry of the reaction is not determined by two&#8208;electron interactions, but by the minimization of Pauli repulsion. This scenario is preserved in related biomimetic reactions leading to steroid scaffolds. In this latter case, the stereochemistry of the cyclization reaction is oriented towards the formation of equatorial C&#8722;C bonds connecting the new six&#8208;six&#8208; and six&#8208;five&#8208;membered fused rings.

         <dc:description>
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free intermolecular coupling strategy was developed, comprising the reaction of halocompounds with styrenes in the presence of NaH and 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, to afford hydrocarbonated products with complete anti&#8208;Markovnikov selectivity. The developed strategy can be applied to a wide range of halocompounds, including aryl and alkyl halides, and shows good functional group tolerance.







Abstract
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free intermolecular coupling reaction of halocompounds with styrenes in the presence of NaH and 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline was developed. This reaction afforded hydrocarbonated products with complete anti&#8208;Markovnikov selectivity. The method allows the use of a wide range of halocompounds, including aryl and alkyl halides, and good functional group tolerance. Detailed mechanistic studies indicated that an anilide anion generated in&#8197;situ by the NaH&#8208;mediated reduction of 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline works as an electron donor and a hydrogen source.

         <title>Hyperbranched Diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based Polymers Constructed via Linear Side&#8208;Chains towards Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hyperbranched diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based polymers were designed and synthesized via linear alkyl side&#8208;chain linkers towards OFETs. The results reveal that 2D topological hyperbranched polymers form stable thin film microstructures, and thus improve the device stability. Besides, the incorporation of linear alkyl chain instead of branching alkyl one can reduce steric hindrance, and thus improve the charge mobility.







Abstract
Conjugated polymers with high charge mobilities have drawn increasing attention in organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) in recent years. However, OFETs of conjugated polymers with high mobility and good device stability remain a challenge. In this article, we report a hyperbranched polymer approach to improve the charge mobility and device stability. Three hyperbranched diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based polymers were designed and synthesized via linear alkyl side&#8208;chain linkers. The results show that 2D topological hyperbranched polymers form stable thin film microstructures, and thus improve the device stability, since the conjugated moiety is interconnected by linear alkyl chain. Besides, the incorporation of linear alkyl chain instead of branching alkyl one reduce steric hindrance, and improve the microstructure ordering as well as the charge mobility. Bar&#8208;coated OFETs result demonstrates that the devices mobilities and operational stabilities (bias stability and bending resistance) are both improved. All these indicate that hyperbranched polymer is a potential candidate for future application.

         <title>A Widely Applicable and Versatile Method for the Ring&#8208;Opening 1,3&#8208;Carbocarbonation of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,3&#8208;Carbocarbonation of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes (DACs) was achieved by employing Grignard reagents under copper catalysis, followed by the addition of carbon electrophiles. This method allowed the installation of both saturated and unsaturated carbon residues at both the electrophilic and nucleophilic sites.







Abstract
A 1,3&#8208;carbocarbonation of 2&#8208;substituted cyclopropane 1,1&#8208;dicarboxylates introduces various saturated or unsaturated carbon residues at the 1&#8208; and 3&#8208; position of the former three&#8208;membered ring. Under copper catalysis, ring&#8208;opening attack with a Grignard reagent proceeded smoothly; the intermediate was converted to the final product by reaction with appropriate carbon&#8208;based electrophiles under basic conditions. As nucleophiles, Grignard reagents derived from sp3&#8208;, sp2&#8208;, and sp&#8208;hybridized carbon residues were successfully employed, whereas various aliphatic bromides and EBX derivatives (for sp moieties) served as electrophiles.

         <title>Divergent Functionalization of Styrenes via Radical/Polar Crossover with CO2 and Sodium Sulfinates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Not so radical: The amalgamation of radical chemistry with polar chemistry is used to develop a tunable multicomponent reaction which involves CO2, sodium sulfinates and styrenes to access both &#946;&#8208;sulfonylateds carboxylic acids through radical&#8211;polar crossover process and to &#945;&#8208;substituted acrylates through sequential sulfonyl radical addition/coupling/elimination process. This setup exhibits excellent tolerance to different functional groups and its application towards biologically relevant molecules and product diversification contributes to the synthetic utility of this method.







Abstract
Sulfones and carboxylic acids are prominent motifs widely present in the chemical structure of agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals and many other highly valuable compounds. Herein, we describe a conjunctive strategy for the precise installation of these functionalities onto styrenes using sodium sulfinates and CO2 as coupling partners. The protocol allowed the preparation of carboxy&#8208;sulfonylated compounds in good yields and broad functional group tolerance. Additionally, taking advantage of the leaving group ability of the sulfone moiety, a one&#8208;pot photocatalytic carboxy&#8208;sulfonylation&#8208;elimination strategy was developed for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;acrylates.

         <dc:description>The template&#8208;directed CH insertion of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters into quinoline was interrogated using computational quantum chemistry. An energetically viable mechanism for this complex multi&#8208;step transformation was elucidated, with attention paid throughout to conformational flexibility and alternative ligand binding modes. Selectivity was found to correlate with distortion from a tetrahedral geometry for the carbon atom involved in CH insertion, a parameter that can be applied to future template design.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>During the last three decades, silicon&#8208;bridged [1]ferrocenophanes have been developed into an important class of monomers with the resulting polymers being the subject of hundreds of publications. For unknown reasons, not a single example of a silicon&#8208;bridged [1]ruthenocenophane is described in the literature. We set out to address this mystery and could synthesize the first sila[1]ruthenocenophanes. Their molecular structures as well as their heat release in the melt, render them as highly strained sandwich compounds that are polymerizable. Why did it take so long to prepare the first sila[1]ruthenocenophanes? This question is addressed by a detailed analysis of the kinetics of the salt&#8208;metathesis approach, which reveals a striking difference between ferrocene and ruthenocene.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Mechanically Interlocked Molecules to Recognize Anions and Cations: A Computational Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ions appear as active components in diverse materials. Here, the bonding energy between mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) or their acyclic/cyclic molecular derivatives and: i) Cl&#8722; and Br&#8722; anions; and/or ii) Na+ and K+ cations, have been investigated. The chemical environment provided by MIMs is less preferably to recognize ionic species compared to unconstrained interactions that are furnished by acyclic molecules.However, MIMs can be more adequate structures to ionic recognition than cyclic compounds if provide a chemical arrangement of the bond sites that relevantly support more favorable interactions with ions compared to Pauli repulsive ambient. The hydrogen replacement by electron donor (&#8211;NH2) or acceptor (&#8211;NO2) groups in MIMs favors the anion/cation recognition due to decreased Pauli repulsion energy and/or more attractive non&#8211;covalent bonds. This study clarifies the chemical environment provided by MIMs to interact with ions and highlights these molecules as relevant structures to realize ionic sensing.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Homo&#8208;Metallic Heavier Analogues of Cyclobutene and the Cyclobutadiene Dianion
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reduction of {(HCDippN)2B}Sn(IPrMe)Br with 1.5&#8197;equivalents of KC8 generates the cyclic tetra&#8208;tin tetra&#8208;boryl system K2[Sn4{B(NDippCH)2}4], a homo&#8208;metallic heavier analogue of the cyclobutadiene dianion. This system is non&#8208;aromatic as determined by Nucleus Independent Chemical Shift Calculations, with the principal resonance structures shown to involve a Sn=Sn double bond and 1,2&#8208;localized negative charges.







Abstract
The reduction of the boryl&#8208;substituted SnII bromide {(HCDippN)2B}Sn(IPrMe)Br with 1.5&#8197;equivalents of potassium graphite leads to the generation of the cyclic tetratin tetraboryl system K2[Sn4{B(NDippCH)2}4], a homo&#8208;metallic heavier analogue of the cyclobutadiene dianion. This system is non&#8208;aromatic as determined by Nucleus Independent Chemical Shift Calculations (NICS(0)=&#8722;0.28, NICS(1)=&#8722;3.17), with the primary contributing resonance structures shown by Natural Resonance Theory (NRT) to involve a Sn=Sn double bond and 1,2&#8208;localized negative charges. Abstraction of the K+ cations or oxidation leads to contraction or cleavage of the Sn4 unit, respectively, while protonation generates the neutral dihydride 1,2&#8208;Sn4{B(NDippCH)2}4H2 (a heavier homologue of cyclobutene) in a manner consistent with the predicted charge distribution in the [Sn4{B(NDippCH)2}4]2&#8722; dianion.

         <title>An Aluminium Imide as a Transfer Agent for the [NR]2&#8722; Function via Metathesis Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions of a terminal aluminium imide with oxygen&#8208;containing substrates are probed with a view to developing its use as a transfer agent for the [NR]2&#8722; fragment. We demonstrate transfer of the imide moiety to [N2], [CO] and [Ph(H)C] fragments to give organo&#8208;azide, &#8208;isocyanate and &#8208;imine products, driven thermodynamically by Al&#8722;O bond formation.







Abstract
The reactions of a terminal aluminium imide with a range of oxygen&#8208;containing substrates have been probed with a view to developing its use as a novel main group transfer agent for the [NR]2&#8722; fragment. We demonstrate transfer of the imide moiety to [N2], [CO] and [Ph(H)C] units driven thermodynamically by Al&#8722;O bond formation. N2O reacts rapidly to generate the organoazide DippN3 (Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3), while CO2 (under dilute reaction conditions) yields the corresponding isocyanate, DippNCO. Mechanistic studies, using both experimental and quantum chemical techniques, identify a carbamate complex K2[(NON)Al&#8208;{&#954;2&#8722;(N,O)&#8722;N(Dipp)CO2}]2 (formed via [2+2] cycloaddition) as an intermediate in the formation of DippNCO, and also in an alternative reaction leading to the generation of the amino&#8722;dicarboxylate complex K2[(NON)Al{&#954;2&#8722;(O,O&#8242;)&#8722;(O2C)2N&#8208;(Dipp)}] (via the take&#8208;up of a second equivalent of CO2). In the case of benzaldehyde, a similar [2+2] cycloaddition process generates the metallacyclic hemi&#8208;aminal complex, Kn[(NON)Al{&#954;2&#8722;(N,O)&#8722;(N(Dipp)C(Ph)(H)O}]n. Extrusion of the imine, PhC(H)NDipp, via cyclo&#8208;reversion is disfavoured thermally, due to the high energy of the putative aluminium oxide co&#8208;product, K2[(NON)Al(O)]2. However, addition of CO2 allows the imine to be released, driven by the formation of the thermodynamically more stable aluminium carbonate co&#8208;product, K2[(NON)Al(&#954;2&#8722;(O,O&#8242;)&#8722;CO3)]2.

     alt="An Aluminium Imide as a Transfer Agent for the [NR]2&#8722; Function via Metathesis Chemistry"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reactions of a terminal aluminium imide&lt;/b&gt; with oxygen-containing substrates are probed with a view to developing its use as a transfer agent for the [NR]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; fragment. We demonstrate transfer of the imide moiety to [N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;], [CO] and [Ph(H)C] fragments to give organo-azide, -isocyanate and -imine products, driven thermodynamically by Al&#8722;O bond formation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reactions of a terminal aluminium imide with a range of oxygen-containing substrates have been probed with a view to developing its use as a novel main group transfer agent for the [NR]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; fragment. We demonstrate transfer of the imide moiety to [N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;], [CO] and [Ph(H)C] units driven thermodynamically by Al&#8722;O bond formation. N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O reacts rapidly to generate the organoazide DippN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (Dipp=2,6-&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), while CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (under dilute reaction conditions) yields the corresponding isocyanate, DippNCO. Mechanistic studies, using both experimental and quantum chemical techniques, identify a carbamate complex K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[(NON)Al-{&#954;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;(N,O)&#8722;N(Dipp)CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (formed via [2+2] cycloaddition) as an intermediate in the formation of DippNCO, and also in an alternative reaction leading to the generation of the amino&#8722;dicarboxylate complex K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[(NON)Al{&#954;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;(O,O&#8242;)&#8722;(O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N-(Dipp)}] (via the take-up of a second equivalent of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). In the case of benzaldehyde, a similar [2+2] cycloaddition process generates the metallacyclic hemi-aminal complex, K&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;[(NON)Al{&#954;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;(N,O)&#8722;(N(Dipp)C(Ph)(H)O}]&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;. Extrusion of the imine, PhC(H)NDipp, via cyclo-reversion is disfavoured thermally, due to the high energy of the putative aluminium oxide co-product, K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[(NON)Al(O)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

         <title>RGD Cyclopeptide Equipped with a Lysine&#8208;Engaging Salicylaldehyde Showing Enhanced Integrin Affinity and Cell Detachment Potency</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A RGD cyclopeptide with a C&#8208;terminal salicylaldehyde tag shows a higher affinity for integrin &#945;V&#946;3 than control compounds. Covalent docking studies ascribe this increased affinity to a plausible formation of an intermolecular imine bond between salicylaldehyde and a Lys residue on the &#946;3 integrin subunit.







Abstract
Salicylaldehyde (SA) derivatives are emerging as useful fragments to obtain reversible&#8208;covalent inhibitors interacting with the lysine residues of the target protein. Here the SA installation at the C terminus of an integrin&#8208;binding cyclopeptide, leading to enhanced ligand affinity for the receptor as well as stronger biological activity in cultured glioblastoma cells is reported.

         <title>Programmed Control of Fluorescence Blinking Patterns based on Electron Transfer in DNA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In single&#8208;molecule fluorescence imaging, in addition to luminance and color, the fluorescence blinking pattern can be a parameter for the simultaneous detection of multiple targets. Electron transfer is known to be one of the major mechanisms of fluorescence blinking. Using DNA as a platform, we show that the blinking pattern can be fine&#8208;tuned by controlling electron transfer.







Abstract
Fluorescence imaging uses changes in the fluorescence intensity and emission wavelength to analyze multiple targets simultaneously. To increase the number of targets that can be identified simultaneously, fluorescence blinking can be used as an additional parameter. To understand and eventually control blinking, we used DNA as a platform to elucidate the processes of electron transfer (ET) leading to blinking, down to the rate constants. With a fixed ET distance, various blinking patterns were observed depending on the DNA sequence between the donor and acceptor units of the DNA platform. The blinking pattern was successfully described with a combination of ET rate constants. Therefore, molecules with various blinking patterns can be developed by tuning ET. It is expected that the number of targets that can be analyzed simultaneously will increase by the power of the number of blinking patterns.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of B4N4&#8208;Heteropentalenes Fused with Polycyclic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of carbon&#8208;BN hybrid molecules (1Naph, 1Anth, and 1Phen), consisting of a B4N4&#8208;heteropentalene core fused with polycyclic aromatic wings, were synthesized and fully characterized, and 1Phen featuring the highest triplet&#8208;state energy among 1 was shown to serve as a good host material for phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes.







Abstract
Hybrid molecules of &#960;&#8208;conjugated carbon rings and BN&#8208;heterocyclic rings (h&#8208;CBNs) fused with each other have been a rare class of compounds due to the limited availability of their synthetic methods. Here we report the synthesis of new h&#8208;CBNs featuring a B4N4&#8208;heteropentalene core and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon wings. Using 1,2&#8208;azaborinine derivatives as a building block, we developed a rational synthetic protocol that allows the formation of a B4N4 ring in a stepwise manner, resulting in the fully fused ABA&#8208;type triblock molecules. Thus, three derivatives of 1 bearing naphthalene (1Naph), anthracene (1Anth), or phenanthrene (1Phen) wings fused with the B4N4 core were synthesized and characterized. Among them, 1Phen, which displays the highest triplet&#8208;state energy, was found to serve a host material for phosphorescent OLED devices, for which a maximum external quantum efficiency of 13.7&#8201;% was recorded. These findings may promote the synthesis of various types of h&#8208;CBNs aiming at new properties arising from the synergy of two different &#960;&#8208;electronic systems.

         <title>An Improved Spectrophotometric Method for Toluene&#8208;4&#8208;Monooxygenase Activity</title>

The incorporation of a novel extraction step into a decades&#8208;old colorimetric assay enables rapid and simple regioisomer quantification of products from monooxygenase enzymes without costly, complex instrumentation.







Abstract
Monooxygenases, an important class of enzymes, have been the subject of enzyme engineering due to their high activity and versatile substrate scope. Reactions performed by these biocatalysts have long been monitored by a colorimetric method involving the coupling of a dye precursor to naphthalene hydroxylation products generated by the enzyme. Despite the popularity of this method, we found the dye product to be unstable, preventing quantitative readout. By incorporating an extraction step to solubilize the dye produced, we have improved this assay to the point where quantitation of enzyme activity is possible. Further, by incorporating spectral deconvolution, we have, for the first time, enabled independent quantification of the two possible regioisomeric products: 1&#8208;naphthol and 2&#8208;naphthol. Previously, such analysis was only possible with chromatographic separation, increasing the cost and complexity of analysis. The efficacy of our improved workflow was evaluated by monitoring the activity of a toluene&#8208;4&#8208;monooxygenase enzyme from Pseudomonas mendocina KR&#8208;1. Our colorimetric regioisomer quantification was found to be consistent with chromatographic analysis by HPLC. The development and validation of a quantitative colorimetric assay for monooxygenase activity that enables regioisomeric distinction and quantification represents a significant advance in analytical methods to monitor enzyme activity. By maintaining facile, low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;throughput readout while incorporating quantification, this assay represents an important alternative to more expensive chromatographic quantification techniques.

         <title>In Situ X&#8208;ray Diffraction Studies on the Reduction of V2O5 and WO3 by Using Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reduction of V2O5 and WO3 with hydrogen, the latter of which is performed industrially in rotary kilns under a hydrogen countercurrent, has been investigated by using in&#8197;situ X&#8208;ray powder diffraction. This method yields insights into the processes illustrated by the transparent section of the furnace, thus gaining information about the reaction pathways as well as compositions and structures of intermediates. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Kohlmann and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203932).

         <title>Structure Elucidation of Lithium Compounds using 7Li Residual Quadrupolar Couplings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new NMR method for structural elucidation of lithium compounds under solution&#8208;like conditions is presented. It is based on the measurement of 7Li residual quadrupolar couplings (RQCs) in a stretched polystyrene (PS) gel, and comparison to RQCs predicted from crystal or DFT&#8208;derived model structures in combination with alignment tensors derived from one&#8208;bond 1H,13C residual dipolar couplings (RDCs). The method is applied to five lithium model complexes containing monoanionic, bidentate bis(benzoxazole&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methanide, bis(benzothiazole&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methanide and bis(pyridyl)&#173;methanide ligands, of which two are first introduced in this work. In agreement with the crystalline state, four complexes are monomeric with Li coordinated fourfold by two additional THF molecules while in one complex bulky tBu&#8208;groups only provide space for one additional THF molecule.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactivity of Silylene with Gallium&#8208; and Boron Trihalide at Reductive Conditions Resulting in Unforeseen Products</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot reaction of gallium and boron halides with potassium graphite in the presence of benzamidinate stabilized silylene LSi&#8208;R, (L = PhC(N t Bu)2). The reaction of LSiCl with an equivalent amount of GaI3 in the presence of KC8 leads to the direct substitution of one chloride group by gallium diiodide simultaneously additional coordination of silylene resulted in L(Cl)Si&#174;GaI2&#8208;Si(L)&#174;GaI3 (1). In compound 1, the structure comprises two differently coordinated gallium atoms where one gallium presents between two silylenes and the other gallium is only coordinated by one silylene. In this Lewis acid&#8208;base reaction the oxidation states of the starting materials remain unchanged. The same is valid in the silylene boron adduct formation of L( t Bu)Si&#8208;BPhCl2 (2) and L( t Bu)Si&#8208;BBr3 (3). This new route provides access to galliumhalosilanes challenging to synthesize by any other method.</dc:description>

         <title>Small Molecule Activation on a Base&#8208;stabilized Phosphinidene</title>

         <dc:description>Reduction of (NP)PCl2 (NP = phosphinoamidinate [PhC(NAr)(=NPPri2)]&#8722;) with KC8 affords the phosphinoamidinato&#8208;supported phosphinidene (NP)P (9).

Reactions of 9 with HBpin and H3SiPh led to the metathesis products (NP)Bpin and (NP)SiH2Ph, respectively, whereas with HPPh2 a base&#8208;stabilized phosphido&#8208;phosphinidene, the product of N&#8208;P and H&#8208;P bond metathesis, was obtained. Reaction of 9 with tetrachlorobenzaquinone results in oxidation of P(I) to P(III), accompanied by oxidation of the amidophosphine ligand into P(V). Addition of benzaldehyde to 9 results in a phospha&#8208;Wittig reaction affording a product of P=P and C=O bond metathesis. Related reaction with phenylisocyanate results in a product of N&#8208;P(=O)Pri2 addition to the C=N bond of an intermediate iminophosphaalkene to produce a phosphinidene intramolecularly stabilized by a diaminocarbene.</dc:description>

         <title>Antibodies Directed Against GalNAc&#8208; and GlcNAc&#8208;O&#8208;Tyrosine Posttranslational Modifications &#8211; a New Tool for Glycoproteomic Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the last decade, it was discovered that protein mucin&#8208; type O&#8208;glycosylation and O&#8208;GlcNAcylation modify Tyr residues besides the well explored Thr and Ser amino acids. Several glycoproteomic studies have identified &#945;&#8208;GalNAc&#8208;O&#8208;Tyr modifications, and studies propose that &#946;&#8208;GlcNAc&#8208;O&#8208;Tyr also exists as a new group of posttranslational modifications (PTMs). Specific bacterial toxins have further been identified to modify host GTPases with &#945;&#8208;GlcNAc&#8208; O&#8208;Tyr top promote bacterial virulence. Despite being identified on numerous proteins, the biological roles, biosynthesis and expression of GalNAc&#8208; and GlcNAc&#8208;O&#8208;Tyr modifications are poorly understood. A major obstacle is the lack of tools to specifically detect and identify proteins containing these modifications. With this in mind, we prepared vaccine constructs and raised antibodies to enable selective detection of proteins carrying these new PTMs. The obtained polyclonal antibody sera were evaluated using ELISA and glycopeptide microarrays and were found to be highly selective for GlcNAc&#8208; and GalNAc&#8208;O&#8208;Tyr glycopeptides over the corresponding Ser&#8208; and Thr&#8208;modifications. For microarray analysis, synthetic GlcNAc&#8208; and GalNAc&#8208;O&#8208;Tyr Fmoc&#8208;amino acids were prepared and applied in Fmoc&#8208;SPPS to obtain an extensive O&#8208;glycopeptide library. After affinity purification, the antibodies were applied in western blot analysis and showed specific detection of &#945;&#8208;GlcNAc&#8208;O&#8208;Tyr modified RhoA GTPase.</dc:description>

We report here that investigations into the cycloadditions of ester or amide enolates with vinyl azides led to the identification of two reaction processes &#8208; direct &#945;&#8208;amination of amides and lactams, and synthesis of ene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams from esters. These reaction outcomes depended on the fate of key vinyl triazoline intermediates generated in the initial cycloaddition step. Isolation of reaction intermediates in the ene&#8208;g&#8208;lactam synthesis revealed the unexpected addition of two enolate equivalents, one of which is later eliminated. Computational studies further suggested an unusual reaction pathway involving direct addition of an enolate to the terminal carbon of the N&#8208;vinyl triazoline. In contrast, the &#945;&#8208;amination of amides and lactams proceeded by rearrangement of the intermediate triazoline to give an imine, hydrolysis or reduction of which gave access to primary or secondary &#945;&#8208;amino amides or lactams.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered Reversible Swelling of Polymeric Spheres via Surfactant&#8208;Free RAFT Emulsion Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Responsive photonic crystals (RPCs) assembled by monodisperse colloidal particles have attracted enormous interests recently due to their tremendous applications in smart devices. Their structural colors can be determined by the particle sizes. However, the lack of a reliable way to tune the sizes in situ limits their development. Herein, we present an efficient route to solve this problem through the fabrication of spherical polymeric particles with light&#8208;triggered reversible swelling behavior via surfactant&#8208;free reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) emulsion polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly. Amphiphilic macro&#8208;RAFT agents containing azobenzene groups were synthesized and subsequently employed to mediate the polymerization of methyl methacrylate. Uniform submicron spheres were obtained by modulating solid contents and other parameters. Benefiting from the photoisomerization of azobenzene moieties, the particle sizes expanded and contracted upon alternative ultraviolet/visible light irradiation accordingly. This strategy will be a supplement to the emulsion PISA and especially give aid to the progress of the RPC materials.</dc:description>

         <title>The tunable and efficient nanoporous CuAg alloy catalysts toward methanol oxidation reaction synthesized by electrochemical dealloying of metallic glassy precursors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we reported three&#8208;dimensional (3D) nanoporous CuAg (NPCuAg) alloy catalysts with various Cu/Ag ratios prepared by electrochemical dealloying of metallic glassy (MG) precursors. All dealloyed samples exhibit homogenous nanoporous structure and element composition distribution. After systematically evaluating their electrocatalytic performance toward MOR, we found that catalytic activity of the NPCuAg catalysts is enhanced along with the increase of Cu/Ag ratio, which may be attributed to the more exposed active reaction sites derived from high surface area of nanoporous structure and the optimal synergistic effect. Thus, the NPCu1.75Ag alloy catalyst presents the best methanol electro&#8208;oxidation properties, including a high current density of 397.2 mA cm&#8208;2 and good operation stability that retaining 84.5% catalytic activity even after 7200 s. These results outperform most reported copper&#8208;based MOR catalysts in alkaline methanol solution. Considering these advantages, the designed electrodes are expected to be promising catalysts for alkaline DMFCs applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Studies on the Energy Release of the MOST System 2&#8208;Carbethoxy&#8208;3&#8208;Phenyl&#8208;Norbornadiene/Quadricyclane (PENBD/PEQC) on Pt(111) and Ni(111)</title>

         <dc:description>Novel energy storage solutions are inevitable for the transition from fossil to renewable energy sources. An auspicious candidate are so&#8208;called molecular solar thermal (MOST) systems. In our study, we investigate the surface chemistry of a derivatized norbornadiene/&#8232;quadricyclane molecule pair. Utilizing suitable push&#8208;pull substituents, a bathochromic shift of the absorption onset is achieved, allowing for a greater overlap with the solar spectrum. Specifically, the adsorption and thermally induced reactions of 2&#8208;carbethoxy&#8208;3&#8208;phenyl&#8208;norbornadiene/quadricyclane are assessed on Pt(111) and Ni(111) as model catalyst surfaces by synchrotron radiation&#8208;based X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The comparison of the respective XP spectra enables the distinction of the energy&#8208;rich molecule from its energy&#8208;lean counterpart and allows for deriving qualitative information on the adsorption motifs. On Pt(111), triggering the release of the stored energy is demonstrated to be successful, as the quantitative cycloreversion reaction is monitored spectroscopically between 140 and 230 K. Heating to above 300 K leads to the fragmentation of the molecular framework. On Ni(111), no conversion of the energy&#8208;rich compound takes place. Individual decomposition pathways of both isomers begin at 160 and 180 K, respectively. Pronounced desorption of almost the entire surface coverage only occurs for the energy&#8208;lean molecule on Ni(111) above 280 K, which suggests weakly bound species. The correlation between adsorption motif and desorption behavior is important for applications of MOST systems in heterogeneously catalyzed processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Static Binding and Dynamic Transporting&#8208;Based Design of Specific Ring&#8208;Chain&#8208;Ring Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitor: From Galantamine to Natural Product</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is a key target for the current symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, and galantamine is a clinical anticholinesterase drug with transiently acting characteristic and good selectivity for AChE.&#160;The present theoretical&#8208;experimental work improves the drug's residence time without reducing inhibition effect, thus provides crucial breakthrough for modifying the inhibitor of AChE with better&#8208;kinetic behavior. The static binding and dynamic delivery properties acquired from atomic view reveal that the galantamine simply occupies catalytic anionic site, and its release from AChE needs only ~ 8.6 kcal/mol.&#160;Both of them may cause the short residence time of galantamine.&#160;The hotspots and most favorable transport mechanism are identified, and the hydrogen bond&#160;and aromatic stacking interactions are observed to play crucial roles for galantamine binding and release in AChE. The typical peripheral anionic site arisen at the delivery process would provide another key occupation to enhance the anti&#8208;release ability for inhibitors.&#160;The compound with &#8220;specific&#8208;ring&#8208;chain&#8208;ring&#8221; framework&#160;with&#160;detail beneficial modify scheme is summarized, which may improve the residence time of inhibitor in AChE. The thermodynamic and dynamic properties of galantamine derivatives&#160;are also studied. Based on dictamnine, a natural alkaloid, two novel eligible derivatives are designed, synthesized&#160;and evaluated, which verifies our prediction. Multiple computational approaches and experiment combination probably provide a train of thought from static and dynamic view to modify or design appropriate inhibitor on the basis of specific binding and transportation features.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Using benzylamines as the C4 source of 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines (1,4&#8208;DHPs), a Cu&#8208;catalyzed oxidative [1+2+1+2] cascade cyclization for the synthesis of 1,4&#8208;DHPs was firstly developed. A broad range of easily available N,N&#8208;dimethyl enaminones and various substituted benzylamines are employed smoothly to provide a diverse range of 1,4&#8208;DHPs with high efficiency. This method is performed by a one&#8208;pot cascade C(sp3)&#8208;H bond functionalization/C(sp3)&#8208;N cleavage/cyclization strategy to form simultaneously two C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp2) bonds, two C(sp2)&#8208;N bonds, and a 1,4&#8208;DHP ring.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrooxidative Rearrangement for Remote Functionalizations of Unactivated Alkenes through Migration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An electrochemical strategy for the dual functionalizations of unactivated alkenes through an intramolecular migration process was realized in the absence of sacrificial chemical oxidants and noble&#8208;metal catalysts under mild reaction conditions. The electrochemistry enabled a (hetero)aryl migration, while providing access to alkenyl/alkynyl&#8208;migration products. Thus, electricity was employed for the formation of functionalized fluoroalkyl radicals through activation of C&#8211;H/C&#8211;Br bonds from fluorinated esters via a distal radical migration process. Thereby, we obtained a variety of di and mono&#8208;fluorinated alkyl products with good functional group tolerance as well as chemo, and regioselectivities. Likewise, defluorinative allylation of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl alkyl bromides proved viable. The reaction mechanism was established by experiments and computation.</dc:description>

         <title>A Highly Active Cobalt Catalyst for the General and Selective Hydrogenation of Aromatic Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanostructured earth abundant metal catalysts that mediate important chemical reactions with high efficiency and selectivity are of great interest. We introduce here a synthesis protocol for nanostructured earth abundant metal catalysts. Three components, an inexpensive metal precursor, an easy to synthesize N/C precursor, and a porous support material undergo pyrolysis to give the catalyst material in a simple, single synthesis step. By applying our catalyst synthesis, a highly active cobalt catalyst for the general and selective hydrogenation of aromatic heterocycles could be generated. The reaction is important with regard to organic synthesis and hydrogen storage. The mild reaction conditions observed for quinolines permit the selective hydrogenation of numerous classes of N&#8208;, O&#8208; and S&#8208;heterocyclic compounds such as: quinoxalines, pyridines, pyrroles, indoles, isoquinoline, aciridine amine, phenanthroline, benzofuranes, and benzothiophenes.</dc:description>
