      <title>Divergent Asymmetric Reactions of ortho&#8208;Quinone Methides with &#945;&#8208;Thiocyanato Indanones for the Synthesis of Spiro&#8208; and Fused&#8208;indanones</title>
      <dc:description>Reported in this work is a water triggered chemo&#8208;divergent enantioselective spiro&#8208;annulation and cascade reaction of  ortho  &#8208;quinone methides (  o  &#8208;QMs) with &#945;&#8208;thiocyanato indanones catalyzed by a chiral organic base. In the case of spiro&#8208;annulation, the use of trace amount of water as additive is critical to achieve high enantioselectivity (up to 96% ee). We found that an cascade reaction was enabled by just tuning the ratio of water in solvent. Accordingly, two new highly efficient asymmetric reactions for the divergent synthesis of spiro&#8208; and fused&#8208;indanone scaffolds with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee) were developed. Mechanistic investigations suggest that interfacial hydrogen bonding may play an important role in achieving the switchable reaction pathways.</dc:description>

      <title>Cucurbit[n]urils for supramolecular catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>The control over chemical reactivity and selectivity are always pursued. Using non&#8208;covalent interactions to achieve efficient and selective catalysis is an essential goal of supramolecular catalysis. Supramolecular catalysis based on cucurbit[n]urils (CB[n]s) possesses distinct characteristics for the unique structure of CB[n]s. CB[n]s are a family of pumpkin&#8208;shaped host molecules with various molecular sizes, rigid structures, electronegative portals and wealthy host&#8208;guest chemistry. Herein, we summarize the three major mechanisms of CB[n]s based supramolecular catalysis. Owing to the structural properties of CB[n]s, CB[n]s can serve as nanoreactors and steric hindrance to modulate the reactivity of substrates. They can also catalyze the reactions by modulating the reactivity of ionized intermediates. Recent progresses on the CB[n]s based supramolecular catalysis are introduced in this mini&#8208;review and the future development in this field is discussed. It is anticipated that this review provides insights into the mechanism of CB[n]s based supramolecular catalysis and may help scientists find new opportunities in this field.</dc:description>

Here, toluene soluble component of pitch is used to prepare a kind of laminated carbon. It was realized by a template&#8208;free synthesis in the low temperature with the addition of pressure.

The prepared anode exhibits a splendid electrochemical performance compared to the traditional graphite anode. A high stable capacity of ca. 550 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 50 mA g  &#8208;1  which is higher much than graphite (372 mAh g  &#8208;1  ) is obtained. And when the current density is up to 2 A g  &#8208;1  , the capacity is about 150 mAh g  &#8208;1  . Surprisingly, it also delivers a superior cycling performance.

      <title>Unusual Nitrene Oxidation Product Formation by Metathesis Involving the Dioxygen O&#8722;O and Borylnitrene B&#8722;N Bonds</title>
      <dc:description>
Overcoming barriers: The reaction of dioxygen with nitrenes can have significant energy barriers. The reaction mechanism of borylnitrene 1 is investigated through matrix&#8208;isolation infrared spectroscopy and high&#8208;level computational quantum chemistry. Borylnitrene 1 reacts with dioxygen to form nitritoborane 3&#8201;a via nitroso&#8208;O&#8208;oxide isomer 2&#8201;c. Nitroso&#8208;O&#8208;oxide isomer 2&#8201;a is stable towards thermal reaction to 3&#8201;a, but dyotropic rearrangement can be achieved photochemically.







Abstract
The reaction of dioxygen with nitrenes can have significant energy barriers, although both reactants are triplet diradicals and the formation of nitroso&#8208;O&#8208;oxides is spin&#8208;allowed. By means of matrix&#8208;isolation infrared spectroscopy in solid argon, nitrogen, and neon, and through high&#8208;level computational quantum chemistry, it is shown herein that a 3&#8208;nitreno&#8208;1,3,2&#8208;benzodioxaborole CatBN (Cat=catecholato) reacts with dioxygen under cryogenic conditions thermally at temperatures as low as 7&#8197;K to produce two distinct products, an anti&#8208;nitroso&#8208;O&#8208;oxide and a nitritoborane CatBONO. The computed barriers for the formation of nitroso&#8208;O&#8208;oxide isomers are very low. Whereas anti&#8208;nitroso&#8208;O&#8208;oxide is kinetically trapped, its bisected isomer has a very low barrier for metathesis, yielding the CatBO+NO radicals in a strongly exothermic reaction; these radicals can combine under matrix&#8208;isolation conditions to give nitritoborane CatBONO. The trapped isomer, anti&#8208;nitroso&#8208;O&#8208;oxide, can form the nitritoborane CatBONO only after photoexcitation, possibly involving isomerization to the bisected isomer of anti&#8208;nitroso&#8208;O&#8208;oxide.

     alt="Unusual Nitrene Oxidation Product Formation by Metathesis Involving the Dioxygen O&#8722;O and Borylnitrene B&#8722;N Bonds"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Overcoming barriers&lt;/b&gt;: The reaction of dioxygen with nitrenes can have significant energy barriers. The reaction mechanism of borylnitrene &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; is investigated through matrix&#8208;isolation infrared spectroscopy and high&#8208;level computational quantum chemistry. Borylnitrene &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; reacts with dioxygen to form nitritoborane &lt;b&gt;3&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; via nitroso&#8208;&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;oxide isomer &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;c&lt;/b&gt;. Nitroso&#8208;&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;oxide isomer &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; is stable towards thermal reaction to &lt;b&gt;3&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;, but dyotropic rearrangement can be achieved photochemically.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reaction of dioxygen with nitrenes can have significant energy barriers, although both reactants are triplet diradicals and the formation of nitroso&#8208;&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;oxides is spin&#8208;allowed. By means of matrix&#8208;isolation infrared spectroscopy in solid argon, nitrogen, and neon, and through high&#8208;level computational quantum chemistry, it is shown herein that a 3&#8208;nitreno&#8208;1,3,2&#8208;benzodioxaborole CatBN (Cat=catecholato) reacts with dioxygen under cryogenic conditions thermally at temperatures as low as 7&#8197;K to produce two distinct products, an &lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;nitroso&#8208;&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;oxide and a nitritoborane CatBONO. The computed barriers for the formation of nitroso&#8208;&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;oxide isomers are very low. Whereas &lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;nitroso&#8208;&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;oxide is kinetically trapped, its bisected isomer has a very low barrier for metathesis, yielding the CatBO+NO radicals in a strongly exothermic reaction; these radicals can combine under matrix&#8208;isolation conditions to give nitritoborane CatBONO. The trapped isomer, &lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;nitroso&#8208;&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;oxide, can form the nitritoborane CatBONO only after photoexcitation, possibly involving isomerization to the bisected isomer of &lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;nitroso&#8208;&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;oxide.&lt;/p&gt;

In contrast to other metal&#8208;based anticancer agents, this organogold compound is less prone to form coordinative bonds with biological nucleophiles, and is expected to exert its drug effects mainly by non&#8208;covalent interactions. Global protein expression changes of treated cancer cells revealed a multi&#8208;modal mode of action of AuTMX2 by alterations in the nucleolus, telomeres, actin stress&#8208;fibers and stress&#8208;responses, which were further supported by pharmacological assays, fluorescence microscopy and cellular accumulation experiments.

      <title>The role of fluorine in glycomimetic drug design</title>
      <dc:description>Glycans are well&#8208;established to play important roles at various stages of infection and disease, and ways to modulate these interactions have been sought as novel therapies. The use of native glycan structures has been met with limited success, which can be attributed to their characteristic high polarity (e.g. low binding affinities) and inherently poor pharmacokinetic properties (e.g. short drug&#8208;target residence times, rapid renal excretion), leading to the development of &#8216;glycomimetics.&#8217; Fluorinated drugs have become increasingly common over recent decades, with fluorinated glycomimetics offering some unique advantages. Deoxyfluorination maintains certain electrostatic interactions, while concomitantly reducing net polarity through &#8216;polar hydrophobicity&#8217;, improving drug residence times and binding affinities. Fluorination destabilizes the oxocarbenium transition state associated with metabolic degradation, and can restore  exo  &#8208; and  endo  &#8208;anomeric effects in C&#8208;glycosides and carbasugars. Lastly, it has shown great utility in radiotracer development and enhancement of antigenicity in glycan&#8208;based vaccines.

      <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Enabled C&#8208;H Functionalization by a Direct Hydrogen Atom Transfer Uranyl Photocatalyst</title>
      <dc:description>Uranyl cation, as a powerful photocatalyst, at present, is seriously delayed compared to the development of its fundamental and structural chemistry. However, the characteristic of highly oxidative capability in the excited state {[UO  2  ]  2+*  (+ 2.6 V vs. SHE) combined with blue light (hv 380&#8208;500 nm) absorption and a long&#8208;lived fluorescence lifetime up to microseconds have revealed that uranyl cation approaches an ideal photocatalyst for visible&#8208;light&#8208;drvien organic transformations. Described herein is a successful utilization of uranyl nitrate photocatalyst which enables C(sp  3  )&#8208;H activation and C&#8208;C bond formation through hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) under blue light irradiation. In particular, this operationally simple scenario provides an appropriate approach to synthesize diverse and valuable diarylmethane motifs.

      <dc:description>We report a dye&#8208;sensitized photoelectrochemical cell (DSPEC) that couples redox&#8208;mediated light&#8208;driven oxidative organic transformations to reductive hydrogen (H2) formation. The DSPEC photoanode consists of a mesoporous anatase TiO2 film on FTO (fluorine&#8208;doped tin oxide), sensitized with the thienopyrroledione&#8208;based dye AP11, while H2 was formed at a FTO&#8211;Pt cathode.

The TEMPO0/+ couple, previously used as redox mediator in DSSC, mediates efficient electron transfer from the organic substrate to the photo&#8208;oxidized dye. A DSPEC photoreactor was designed that allows in situ monitoring the reaction progress by infrared spectroscopy and gas chromatography. Sustained light&#8208;driven oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde within the DSPEC photoreactor, using of TEMPO as mediator, demonstrated the efficiency of the device, with a photocurrent of 0.4 mA cm&#8208;2, approaching quantitative Faradaic efficiency and exhibiting excellent device stability.</dc:description>

      <title>Photochemistry with Chlorine Trifluoride: Syntheses and Characterization of Difluorooxychloronium(V) Hexafluorido(non)metallates(V), [ClOF2][MF6] (M = V, Nb, Ta, Ru, Os, Ir, P, Sb)</title>
      <dc:description>A photochemical route to salts consisting of difluorooxychloronium(V) cations, [ClOF2]+, and hexafluorido(non)metallate(V) anions, [MF6]&#8722; (M = V, Nb, Ta, Ru, Os, Ir, P, Sb) is presented. As starting materials, either metals, oxygen and ClF3 or oxides and ClF3 are used. The prepared compounds were characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. The crystal structures of [ClOF2][MF6] (M = V, Ru, Os, Ir, P, Sb) are layer structures that are isotypic with the previously reported compound [ClOF2][AsF6], whereas for M = Nb and Ta, similar crystal structures with a different stacking variant of the layers are observed. Additionally, partial or full O/F disorder within the [ClOF2]+ cations of the Nb and Ta compounds occurs. In all compounds reported here, a trigonal pyramidal [ClOF2]+ cation with three additional Cl&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;F contacts to neighboring [MF6]&#8722; anions is observed, resulting in an pseudo&#8208;octahedral coordination sphere around the Cl atom. The Cl&#8722;F and Cl&#8722;O bond lengths of the [ClOF2]+ cations seem to correlate with the effective ionic radii of the M(V) ions. Quantum&#8208;chemical, solid&#8208;state calculations well reproduce the experimental Raman spectra and show, as do quantum&#8208;chemical gas phase calculations, that the secondary Cl&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;F interactions are ionic in nature. However, both solid&#8208;state and gas&#8208;phase quantum&#8208;chemical calculations fail to reproduce the increases in the Cl&#8722;O bond lengths with increasing effective ionic radius of M in [MF6]&#8722; and the Cl&#8722;O Raman shifts also do not generally follow this trend.</dc:description>

      <title>High Efficiency FRET Processes in BODIPY Functionalized Quantum Dot Architectures</title>
      <dc:description>Efficient FRET systems are developed combining colloidal CdSe quantum dots (QDs) donors and BODIPY acceptors. To promote effective energy transfer in FRET architectures, the distance between the organic fluorophore and the QDs needs to be optimized by a careful system engineering. In this context, BODIPY dyes bearing amino&#8208;terminated functionalities are used in virtue of the high affinity of amine groups in coordinating the QD surface. A preliminary QD surface treatment with a short amine ligand is performed to favour the interaction with the organic fluorophores in solution. The successful coordination of the dye to the QD surface, accomplishing a short donor&#8208;acceptor distance, provides effective energy transfer already in solution, with efficiency of 76%. The efficiency further increases in solid state where the QDs and the dye are deposited as single coordinated units from solution, with a distance between the fluorophores down to 2.2 nm, demonstrating the effectiveness of the coupling strategy.</dc:description>

      <title>Cyanine&#8208;Flavonol Hybrids for Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Activated Delivery of Carbon Monoxide</title>
      <dc:description>
Carbon monoxide (CO) is an endogenous signaling molecule with a remarkable therapeutic potential hindered by its inherent toxicity. The cross&#8208;breeding of a CO&#8208;releasing flavonol moiety with a cyanine dye enabled access to the family of CO&#8208;releasing molecules activatable upon irradiation with near&#8208;infrared light up to 820&#8197;nm. These hybrids liberate two molecules of CO with efficiencies surpassing those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art systems by two orders of magnitude. The biocompatibility and applicability of this system were showcased both in vitro and in vivo. The cover image was created by Lenka &#352;tackov&#225;, Peter &#352;tacko, and Orazio Angelo Arcidiacono. More information can be found in the Full Paper by P. &#352;tacko, P.

      <title>Second Comes First: Switching Elementary Steps in Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>
The electron&#8208;poor palladium(0) complex L3Pd (L=tris[3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]phosphine) first undergoes transmetalation with RMgCl or RLi before it reacts with alkyl halides in an oxidative addition. Thus, the order of these elementary steps is reversed in comparison to conventional palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions.







Abstract
The electron&#8208;poor palladium(0) complex L3Pd (L=tris[3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]phosphine) reacts with Grignard reagents RMgX and organolithium compounds RLi via transmetalation to furnish the anionic organopalladates [L2PdR]&#8722;, as shown by negative&#8208;ion mode electrospray&#8208;ionization mass spectrometry. These palladates undergo oxidative additions of organyl halides R&#8242;X (or related SN2&#8208;type reactions) followed by further transmetalation. Gas&#8208;phase fragmentation of the resulting heteroleptic palladate(II) complexes results in the reductive elimination of the cross&#8208;coupling products RR&#8242;. This reaction sequence corresponds to a catalytic cycle, in which the order of the elementary steps of transmetalation and oxidative addition is switched relative to that of palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions proceeding via neutral intermediates. An attractive feature of the palladate&#8208;based catalytic system is its ability to mediate challenging alkyl&#8211;alkyl coupling reactions. However, the poor stability of the phosphine ligand L against decomposition reactions has so far prevented its successful use in practical applications.

     alt="Second Comes First: Switching Elementary Steps in Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The electron&#8208;poor palladium(0) complex&lt;/b&gt; L&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Pd (L=tris[3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]phosphine) first undergoes transmetalation with RMgCl or RLi before it reacts with alkyl halides in an oxidative addition. Thus, the order of these elementary steps is reversed in comparison to conventional palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electron&#8208;poor palladium(0) complex L&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Pd (L=tris[3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]phosphine) reacts with Grignard reagents RMgX and organolithium compounds RLi via transmetalation to furnish the anionic organopalladates [L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PdR]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, as shown by negative&#8208;ion mode electrospray&#8208;ionization mass spectrometry. These palladates undergo oxidative additions of organyl halides R&#8242;X (or related S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2&#8208;type reactions) followed by further transmetalation. Gas&#8208;phase fragmentation of the resulting heteroleptic palladate(II) complexes results in the reductive elimination of the cross&#8208;coupling products RR&#8242;. This reaction sequence corresponds to a catalytic cycle, in which the order of the elementary steps of transmetalation and oxidative addition is switched relative to that of palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions proceeding via neutral intermediates. An attractive feature of the palladate&#8208;based catalytic system is its ability to mediate challenging alkyl&#8211;alkyl coupling reactions. However, the poor stability of the phosphine ligand L against decomposition reactions has so far prevented its successful use in practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Selective Phase Transfer Reagents (OxP&#8208;crowns) for Chromogenic Detection of Nitrates Especially Ammonium Nitrate</title>
      <dc:description>
A color&#8208;based detector for ammonium nitrate consists of crown ether&#8208;appended oxoporphyrinogens, the OxP&#8208;Crowns, which extract ion pairs into an organic phase based on cation binding at crown ether and anion complexation. Selective mauve chromogenic response is observed when ammonium nitrate, commonly used in improvised explosive devices, is extracted from water to chloroform providing a simple test. As illustrated, a network of responses is found when considering other anions and aqueous phase pH. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J.&#8197;P. Hill et&#8197;al.

      <title>Structure Directing Roles of Organic Molecules in the Formation of Aluminosilicate and Aluminophosphate Molecular Sieves Revealed by 2D 1H DQ&#8208;SQ NMR Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>Understanding of crystallization mechanisms of molecular sieves is driven by the broad range of usefulness and unique properties they possess. It is still difficult to obtain information related to their crystallization mechanism of molecular sieves, partly because the materials are generally prepared under hydrothermal conditions and the whole reactions have happened in the &#8220;black box&#8221; autoclave.

      <title>Structure&#8208;Property Relationships in Bithiophenes with Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Substituents</title>
      <dc:description>The use of crystal engineering to control the supramolecular arrangement of &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules in the solid&#8208;state is of considerable interest for the development of novel organic electronic materials. In the present study, we investigated the effect of combining of two types of supramolecular interactions with different geometric requirements, amide hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;interactions, on the &#960;&#8208;overlap between calamitic &#960;&#8208;conjugated cores. To this end, we prepared two series of bithiophene diesters and diamides with methylene, ethylene, or propylene spacers between the bithiophene core and the functional groups in their terminal substituents. The hydrogen&#8208;bonded bithiophene diamides showed significantly denser packing of the bithiophene cores than the diesters and other known &#945;,&#969;&#8208;disubstituted bithiophenes. The bithiophene packing density reach a maximum in the bithiophene diamide with an ethylene spacer, which featured the smallest longitudinal bithiophene displacement and infinite 1D arrays of electronically conjugated, parallel, and almost linear N&#8211;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O=C hydrogen bonds. The synergistic hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;interactions were attributed to the favorable conformational mechanics of the ethylene spacer and resulted in H&#8208;type spectroscopic aggregates in solid&#8208;state absorption spectroscopy. These results demonstrate that the optoelectronic properties of &#960;&#8208;conjugated materials in the solid&#8208;state may be tailored systematically via side chain engineering, and hence that this approach has significant potential for the design of organic and polymer semiconductors.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This review focuses on the usefulness of coordination bonds to create 3D printable inks and shows how the union of chemistry and 3D technology contributes to new scientific advances, by allowing amorphous or polycrystalline solids to be transformed into objects with the desired shape for successful applications. The review clearly shows how there has been a considerable increase in the manufacture of objects based on the combination of organic matrices and coordination compounds. These coordination compounds are usually homogeneously dispersed within the matrix, anchored onto proper support, or coating the printed object, without destroying their unique properties. Advances are so fast that today it has already been possible to 3D print objects made exclusively from coordination compounds without additives. The new printable inks are made mainly with nano&#8208; non&#8208;porous coordination polymers, metal&#8208;organic gels, or metal&#8208;organic frameworks. The highly dynamic coordination bond allows the creation of objects with responses to stimuli that can act as sensors and drug delivery. In addition, the join of metal&#8208;organic frameworks with 3D print allows increasing the adsorption or selective capacity of the object concerning the original compound, being useful in energy storage, in gas separation, or water pollutant elimination. Furthermore, the metal ion's presence can give them new properties such as luminescence finding usefulness in sensors, or anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Technological advances, the combination of various printing techniques, the properties of the coordination bonds, anything goes to create surprising new printable inks and objects with highly complex shapes, that will shorten the gap between the academy and the industry of the coordination compounds.</dc:description>

      <title>Clar Goblet and Aromaticity Driven Multiradical Nanographenes</title>
      <dc:description>The Clar Goblet, the first radical bowtie nanographene proposed by Erich Clar nearly 50 years ago, was recently synthesized. Bowtie nanographenes present quasi&#8208;degenerate magnetic ground states which make them so elusive as unique. We present a thorough analysis of the spin states energetics of Clar Goblet and bowtie nanographenes by a battery of existing and novel ab initio procedures ranging from density functional theory to complete active space Hamiltonians. With this, we prove that &#960; radicals of bowtie nanographenes sit on BP (Benzo[cd]Pyrene) moieties driven by their local aromaticity, a purely chemical concept, which confers global stability to the whole structure. Besides, we present a novel Pauli energy densities analysis providing a visual intuitive explanation for this preference. These findings allow envisioning that analogous bowtie nanographenes with arbitrary polyradical character are not only feasible at the molecular scale but that will share Clar Goblet&#8217;s peculiar properties.</dc:description>

      <title>Stepwise physisorption of alkoxy&#8208;pyrene derivatives onto a lamellar, non&#8208;porous naphthalenediimide&#8208;template on HOPG</title>
      <dc:description>The development of new strategies for the preparation of multicomponent supramolecular assemblies is a major challenge on the road to complex functional molecular systems. Here we present the use of a non&#8208;porous self&#8208;assembled monolayer from uC33&#8208;NDI&#8208;uC33, a naphthalenediimide symmetrically functionalized with unsaturated 33 carbon&#8208;atom&#8208;chains, to prepare bicomponent supramolecular surface systems with a series of alkoxy&#8208;pyrene (PyrOR) derivatives at the liquid/HOPG interface. While previous attempts at directly depositing many of these PyrOR units at the liquid/HOPG interface failed, the multicomponent approach through the uC33&#8208;NDI&#8208;uC33 template enabled control over molecular interactions and facilitated physisorption. The PyrOR deposition restructured the initial uC33&#8208;NDI&#8208;uC33 monolayer, causing an expansion in two dimensions to accommodate the guests. As far as we know, this represent the first example of a non&#8208;porous or non&#8208;metal complex&#8208;bearing monolayer that allows the stepwise formation of multicomponent supramolecular architectures on surfaces.</dc:description>

      <title>Breslow Intermediates (Aminoenols) and their Keto Tautomers: First Gas&#8208;Phase Characterization by IR Ion Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>Breslow intermediates (BIs) are the crucial nucleophilic amino enol intermediates formed from electrophilic aldehydes in the course of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalyzed Umpolung reactions. Both in organocatalytic and enzymatic Umpolung, the question whether the Breslow intermediate exists as the nucleophilic enol, or in the form of its electrophilic keto&#8208;tautomer, is of utmost importance for its reactivity and function. We herein report the preparation of charge&#8208;tagged Breslow intermediates/keto tautomers derived from three different types of NHCs (imidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenes, 1,2,4&#8208;triazolin&#8208;5&#8208;ylidenes, thiazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenes) and aldehydes. An ammonium charge&#8208;tag is introduced by either the aldehyde unit or the NHC. ESI&#8208;MS IR&#8208;Ion spectroscopy allowed for the unambiguous conclusion that in the gas&#8208;phase, the imidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene derived BI indeed exists as a diamino enol, while both 1,2,4&#8208;triazolin&#8208;5&#8208;ylidenes and thiazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenes give the keto&#8208;tautomer. This result coincides with the tautomeric states observed for the BIs in solution (NMR) and in the crystalline state (XRD), and is in line with our earlier calculations on the energetics of BI keto&#8208;enol equilibria.</dc:description>

      <title>Tuning Optical Properties by Controlled Aggregation: Electroluminescence Assisted by Thermally&#8208;Activated Delayed Fluorescence from Thin Films of Crystalline Chromophores</title>
      <dc:description>Several photophysical properties of chromophores depend crucially on intermolecular interactions. Thermally&#8208;activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) is often influenced by close packing of the chromophore assembly. In this context, the metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) approach has several advantages: it can be used to steer aggregation such that the orientation within aggregated structures can be predicted using rational approaches. We demonstrate this design concept for a DPA&#8208;TPE (diphenylamine&#8208;tetraphenylethylene) chromophore, which is non&#8208;emissive in its solvated state due to vibrational quenching. Turning this DPA&#8208;TPE into a ditopic linker allows to grow oriented MOF thin films exhibiting pronounced green electroluminescence with low onset voltages. Measurements at different temperatures clearly demonstrate the presence of TADF. Finally, we show that the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer process used for MOF thin film deposition allowed to integrate the TADF&#8208;DPA&#8208;TPE in a functioning LED device.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The dihalogenation of alkenes is one of the classic reactions in organic chemistry and a prime example for an electrophilic addition reaction. The often observed  anti  &#8208;selectivity in this addition reaction can be explained by the formation of a haliranium ion intermediate. Despite being studied for more than a century, the development of reagent&#8208;controlled, enantioselective dihalogenation has been very difficult.

      <title>Dual crosslinking photo&#8208;switches for orthogonal photo&#8208;control of hybridization between serinol nucleic acid and RNA</title>
      <dc:description>Wavelength&#8208;selective photo&#8208;regulation by multiple chromophores responding to different wavelength can expand the variation of photo&#8208;manipulating system. Herein, we report orthogonal photo&#8208;regulation of duplex formation between serinol nucleic acid (SNA) and RNA using light&#8208;induced crosslinking reactions mediated by a new photo&#8208;reactive nucleobase 8&#8208;naphthylvinyladenine (  NV  A) and previously described 8&#8208;pyrenylvinyladenine (  PV  A). An intrastrand crosslink was induced in an SNA strand containing two adjacent&#160;  NV  A residues by irradiation with 340&#8208;405 nm light; the crosslink was reversed by irradiation with &#8804; 300 nm light. In an SNA strand with adjacent&#160;  NV  A and&#160;  PV  A residues, an intrastrand crosslink resulted from irradiation with 405&#8208;465 nm light that was reversed by irradiation with &#8804; 340 nm light. Intrastrand photo&#8208;crosslinking caused severe destabilization of an SNA/RNA duplex, resulting in dissociation to single strands. Cycloreversion resulted in duplex formation. With these&#160;  NV  A/  NV  A and&#160;  NV  A/  PV  A photo&#8208;switches, four hybridization states of two SNA/RNA duplexes could be orthogonally photo&#8208;controlled by irradiation with a suitable wavelength of light.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of bio&#8208;inspired guanine microplatelets: morphological and crystallographic control</title>
      <dc:description>&#946;&#8208;phase anhydrous guanine (&#946;&#8208;AG) crystals are one of the most widespread organic crystals to construct optical structures in organisms. Currently no synthetic method is available that allows for producing guanine crystals with similar control in size, morphology and crystallography as in biological ones. Here we report a facile one&#8208;step synthesis route to fabricate bio&#8208;inspired guanine microplatelets with (100) exposing planes in almost pure &#946;&#8208;phase.&#160;The synthesis is based on a precipitation process of a guanine&#8208;sodium hydroxide solution in formamide with poly(1&#8208;vinylpyrrolidone&#8208;co&#8208;vinyl acetate) as a morphological additive. Due to their uniform size (ca. 20 &#181;m) and thickness (ca. 110 nm), the crystals represent the first synthetic guanine microplatelets that exhibit strong structural coloration and pearlescent lusters.&#160;Moreover, we utilize this synthesis route as a model system to investigate the effects of guanine analogues, including uric acid, hypoxanthine, xanthine, adenine, and guanosine, during the crystallization process.&#160;Our results indicate that the introduction of guanine analogues not only can reduce the required synthesis temperature but also provide a versatile control in crystal morphology and polymorph selection between the &#945;&#8208;phase AG (&#945;&#8208;AG) and &#946;&#8208;AG. Turbidity experiments show that the &#946;&#8208;AG microplatelets are formed with a fast precipitation rate in comparison to &#945;&#8208;AG, suggesting that the formation of &#946;&#8208;AG crystals follows a kinetically driven process.</dc:description>

      <title>Predicting Properties of Iron(III) TAML Activators of Peroxides from Their III/IV and IV/V Reduction Potentials or a Lost Battle to Peroxidase</title>
      <dc:description>Cyclic voltammetry study of a series of iron(III) TAML activators of peroxides of several generations in acetonitrile as solvent revealed reversible or quasi&#8208;reversible Fe  III/IV  and Fe  IV/V  anodic transitions, the formal reduction potentials  E  &#176;' for which are observed in the ranges of 0.4&#8211;1.2 and 1.4&#8211;1.6 V, respectively, versus Ag/AgCl. The slope of 0.33 for a linear  E  &#176;'(IV/V) against  E  &#176;'(III/IV) plot suggests that the TAML ligand system plays a bigger role in the Fe  III/IV  transition whereas the second electron transfer is to a larger extent an iron&#8208;centered phenomenon.

      <title>Cyanine&#8208;Flavonol Hybrids for Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Activated Delivery of Carbon Monoxide</title>
      <dc:description>
CO worker: Carbon monoxide (CO) is a signaling molecule with potent therapeutic properties hampered by its inherent toxicity. Here, cross&#8208;breeding a CO&#8208;releasing flavonol moiety with heptamethine cyanine dye leads to highly efficient transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free photoCORMs (CO&#8208;releasing molecules). These photoCORMs operate in the middle of the phototherapeutic window, release two molecules of CO upon irradiation, and are shown to be applicable in vivo.







Abstract
Carbon monoxide (CO) is an endogenous signaling molecule that controls a number of physiological processes. To circumvent the inherent toxicity of CO, light&#8208;activated CO&#8208;releasing molecules (photoCORMs) have emerged as an alternative for its administration. However, their wider application requires photoactivation using biologically benign visible and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light. In this work, a strategy to access such photoCORMs by fusing two CO&#8208;releasing flavonol moieties with a NIR&#8208;absorbing cyanine dye is presented. These hybrids liberate two molecules of CO in high chemical yields upon activation with NIR light up to 820&#8197;nm and exhibit excellent uncaging cross&#8208;sections, which surpass the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art by two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the biocompatibility and applicability of the system in vitro and in vivo are demonstrated, and a mechanism of CO release is proposed. It is hoped that this strategy will stimulate the discovery of new classes of photoCORMs and accelerate the translation of CO&#8208;based phototherapy into practice.

      <title>Frontispiece: Library Design Strategies To Accelerate Fragment&#8208;Based Drug Discovery</title>
      <dc:description>
When doing a challenging puzzle, having colored pieces can make it significantly easier to solve compared to non&#8208;colored pieces. Similarly, the use of augmented fragment libraries for fragment&#8208;based drug discovery (FBDD) may significantly aid the development of a new drug compared to the use of standard fragment libraries. Such library strategies include the application of specialized fragments for NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography, covalent linkage for mass spectrometry, dynamic combinatorial chemistry, and optimized fragments. These approaches may accelerate drug discovery either by improving the speed or quality of fragment&#8208;based screening or by enabling faster hit&#8208;to&#8208;lead chemistry for fragment elaboration. For more details see the Minireview by N.&#8197;S. Troelsen and M.&#8197;H. Clausen on page&#8197;11391&#8197;ff.

      <dc:description>
Diarylethene having an azulene ring with an electron donor at 1&#8208;position showed photocyclization reaction upon UV irradiation in hexane. The reaction was analyzed using density functional calculations, and the compound was considered to photocyclize from the S11 excited state, which is mainly composed of the HOMO&#8722;1&#8594;LUMO+2 transition. It was shown that the S0&#8594;S1 excitation was inactive. The picture of the eleven&#8208;storied stone stupa taken at Kiyomizu&#8208;dera Temple in Kyoto is reminiscent of this reaction.

      <title>The Cascade Reactions of Indigo with Propargyl Substrates for Heterocyclic and Photophysical Diversity</title>
      <dc:description>The synthesis of structurally diverse heterocycles for chemical space exploration was achieved  via  the cascade reactions of indigo with propargylic electrophiles. New pyrazinodiindolodione, naphthyridinedione, azepinodiindolone, oxazinoindolone and pyrrolodione products were prepared in one pot reactions by varying the leaving group (&#8208;Cl, &#8208;Br, &#8208;OMs, &#8208;OTs) or propargyl terminal functionality (&#8208;H, &#8208;Me, &#8208;Ph, &#8208;Ar). Mechanistic and density functional theory studies revealed that the unsaturated propargyl moiety can behave as an electrophile when aromatic terminal substitutions are made, and therefore competes with leaving group substitution for new outcomes. Selected products from the cascade reactions were investigated for their absorption and fluorescence properties, including transient absorption spectroscopy. This revealed polarity dependent excited state relaxation pathways, fluorescence, and triplet formation, thus highlighting these reactions as a means to access diverse functional materials rapidly.</dc:description>

      <title>Mechanistic study of Pd/NHC&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira reaction: discovery of NHC&#8208;ethynyl coupling process</title>

A number of possible intermediates of this transformation with common formulae (NHC)xPd(C2Ph) (x = 1,2) were observed and subjected to collision&#8208;induced dissociation (CID) and infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD) experiments studies to elucidate their structure. Measured bond dissociation energies (BDEs) and IRMPD spectra were in an excellent agreement with quantum calculations for coupling product &#960;&#8208;complexes with Pd(0). Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed multiple observed CID fragmentation pathways.

      <title>Synthesis of Oligonucleotides containing the cis&#8208;Interstrand Crosslink Produced by Mitomycins in their Reaction with DNA</title>
      <dc:description>
Mitomycins are important anti&#8208;cancer drugs. Treatment of cancer cells with mitomycins generates stereoisomeric (trans and cis) DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs), which prevent these highly proliferating cells from replicating. trans&#8208;Crosslinks are formed exclusively at CpG sequences, while cis&#8208;crosslinks are formed only at GpC sequences. This work describes a synthetic methodology to generate oligonucleotides containing the cis&#8208;ICL (green ICL in the picture). Structural proof of the crosslinked oligonucleotide was obtained, and a virtual model of the duplex was created. More information can be found in the Full Paper by E. Champeil et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202002452).

     alt="Synthesis of Oligonucleotides containing the cis&#8208;Interstrand Crosslink Produced by Mitomycins in their Reaction with DNA"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mitomycins are important anti&#8208;cancer drugs&lt;/b&gt;. Treatment of cancer cells with mitomycins generates stereoisomeric (&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;) DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs), which prevent these highly proliferating cells from replicating. &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;Crosslinks are formed exclusively at CpG sequences, while &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;crosslinks are formed only at GpC sequences. This work describes a synthetic methodology to generate oligonucleotides containing the &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;ICL (green ICL in the picture). Structural proof of the crosslinked oligonucleotide was obtained, and a virtual model of the duplex was created. More information can be found in the Full Paper by E. Champeil et&#8197;al. (DOI: &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.20200245210.1002/chem.202002452&lt;/a&gt;).

      <title>Electrocatalytic Proton Reduction by a Cobalt Complex Containing a Proton&#8208;Responsive Bis(alkylimdazole)methane Ligand: Involvement of a C&#8722;H Bond in H2 Formation</title>
      <dc:description>
The design of proton&#8208;responsive ligands and their use in the field of homogeneous electrocatalytic proton reduction is reported in this work. The cobalt complex, [Co(HBMIMPh2)2]2+ comprises two bis(1&#8208;methyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methane (HBMIMPh2) ligands that contain an acidic methylene moiety in their backbone. The reported results represent the joint involvement of a base metal&#8208;hydride and a C&#8722;H bond in electrocatalytic proton reduction and are of interest to the development of responsive ligands for molecular (base)metal (electro)catalysis. More information can be found in the Full Paper by R.&#8197;J.&#8197;M. Klein&#8197;Gebbink et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.201905746).

Alkaline earth metals activate the fixation of N2 because of the &#960;&#8208;backdonation from the metal to the ligand; a phenomenon often considered exclusive to transition metals. Conceptual DFT descriptors reveal an increased soft character of the outer N&#8208;atom in cubic and octahedral group II, IV, and VI complexes, compared to isolated N2.

      <title>Heterogeneous Parahydrogen&#8208;Induced Polarization of Diethyl Ether for Magnetic Resonance Imaging Applications</title>
      <dc:description>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with the use of hyperpolarized gases as contrast agents provides valuable information on lungs structure and function. While the technology of  129  Xe hyperpolarization for clinical MRI research is well developed, it requires the expensive equipment for production and detection of hyperpolarized  129  Xe. Herein we present the  1  H hyperpolarization of diethyl ether vapor that can be imaged on any clinical MRI scanner.  1  H nuclear spin polarization of up to 1.3% was achieved using heterogeneous hydrogenation of ethyl vinyl ether with parahydrogen over Rh/TiO  2  catalyst. Liquefaction of diethyl ether vapor proceeds with partial preservation of hyperpolarization and prolongs its lifetime by ~10 times. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle 2D  1  H MRI of hyperpolarized diethyl ether was demonstrated with 0.1&#215;1.1 mm  2  spatial and 120 ms temporal resolution. The long history of use of diethyl ether for anesthesia is expected to facilitate the clinical translation of the presented approach.</dc:description>

      <title>The deposition of the spin crossover Fe(II)&#8208;pyrazolylborate complex on Au(111) surface at molecular level</title>
      <dc:description>The interaction at molecular level of the spin&#8208;crossover Fe  II  ((3,5&#8208;(CH  3  )  2  Pz)  3  BH)  2  complex with the Au(111) surface is analyzed by means of rPBE periodic calculations. Our results show that the adsorption on the metallic surface enhances the transition energy, increasing the relative stability of the low spin (LS) state. The interaction indeed is spin&#8208;dependent, stronger for the low spin than the high spin (HS) state. The different strength of the Fe ligand field at low and high temperature manifests on the nature, spatial extension and relative energy of the states close to the Fermi level, with a larger metal&#8208;ligand hybridization in the LS state. This feature is of relevance for the differential adsorption of the LS and HS molecules, the spin&#8208;dependent conductance, and for the differences found in the corresponding STM images, correctly reproduced from the density of states provided by the rPBE calculations. It is expected that this spin dependence will be a general feature of the SCO molecule&#8208;substrate interaction, since it is rooted in the different ligand field of Fe site at low and high temperatures, a common hallmark of the Fe(II) SCO complexes. Finally, the states involved in the LIESST phenomenon has been identify through NEVPT2 calculations on a model reaction path. A tentative pathway for the photoinduced LS [[EQUATION]] HS transition is proposed, that does not involve the intermediate triplet states, and nicely reproduces both the blue laser wavelength required for the activation, and the wavelength of the reverse HS [[EQUATION]] LS transition.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The interaction at molecular level of the spin&#8208;crossover Fe  II  ((3,5&#8208;(CH  3  )  2  Pz)  3  BH)  2  complex with the Au(111) surface is analyzed by means of rPBE periodic calculations. Our results show that the adsorption on the metallic surface enhances the transition energy, increasing the relative stability of the low spin (LS) state. The interaction indeed is spin&#8208;dependent, stronger for the low spin than the high spin (HS) state. The different strength of the Fe ligand field at low and high temperature manifests on the nature, spatial extension and relative energy of the states close to the Fermi level, with a larger metal&#8208;ligand hybridization in the LS state. This feature is of relevance for the differential adsorption of the LS and HS molecules, the spin&#8208;dependent conductance, and for the differences found in the corresponding STM images, correctly reproduced from the density of states provided by the rPBE calculations. It is expected that this spin dependence will be a general feature of the SCO molecule&#8208;substrate interaction, since it is rooted in the different ligand field of Fe site at low and high temperatures, a common hallmark of the Fe(II) SCO complexes. Finally, the states involved in the LIESST phenomenon has been identify through NEVPT2 calculations on a model reaction path. A tentative pathway for the photoinduced LS [[EQUATION]] HS transition is proposed, that does not involve the intermediate triplet states, and nicely reproduces both the blue laser wavelength required for the activation, and the wavelength of the reverse HS [[EQUATION]] LS transition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>A Water&#8208;Soluble Peptoid that Can Extract Cu2+ from Metallothionein via Selective Recognition</title>
      <dc:description>Selective binding of Cu  2+  in water medium by a synthetic chelator is a promising therapeutic approach towards the treatment of various diseases including cancer. Chelation of Cu  2+  is well exercised, however water&#8208;soluble synthetic chelators that can selectively bind Cu  2+  from a pool of competing metal ions at very high excess and/or can extract Cu  2+  from a protein are hardly reported. Herein we describe the design and synthesis of an acetylated peptoid &#8211; N&#8208;substituted glycine trimer &#8211; that incorporates a picolyl group at the N&#8208;terminal, a non&#8208;coordinating but structurally directing bulky chiral phenylethyl group at the  C  &#8208;terminus and a modified 2,2'&#8208;bipyridine group (  PCA&#8208;Nspe  ), which selectively binds Cu  2+  to form a water&#8208;soluble complex. We further demonstrate that the selectivity of  PCA&#8208;Nspe  to Cu  2+  is thermodynamically driven, leading to specific binding of Cu  2+  in an aqueous solution containing up to 60 folds excess of other biologically relevant metal ions such as Zn  2+  , Co  2+  , Mn  2+  , Ca  2+  , Mg  2+  , K  +  and Na  +  . Based on spectroscopic data and DFT calculations of  PCA&#8208;Nspe  as well as of a control peptoid having an achiral benzyl group instead of the phenylethyl side chain, we could suggest that the chiral and bulkier phenylethyl group at the  C  &#8208;terminus controls the preorganization of the two ligands and this might play a role in the selectivity of  PCA&#8208;Nspe  . Significantly, we show that  PCA&#8208;Nspe  can extract Cu  2+  from the natural copper binding protein metallothionein.</dc:description>

      <title>Structural Expansion of Chalcogenido Tetrelates in Ionic Liquids by Incorporation of Sulfido Antimonate Units</title>
      <dc:description>Multinary chalcogenido metalate salts exhibit finely tunable optical properties based on the combination of metal and chalcogenide ions in their polyanionic substructure. Here, we present the structural expansion of chalcogenido germanate(IV) or stannate(IV) architectures with Sb(III), which clearly affects the vibrational and optical absorption properties of the solid compounds. For the synthesis of the title compounds, [K4(H2O)4][Ge4S10] or [K4(H2O)4][SnS4] were reacted with SbCl3 under ionothermal conditions in imidazolium based ionic liquids. Salt metathesis at relatively low temperatures (120&#176;C) enabled the incorporation of (formally) Sb3+ ions into the anionic substructure of the precursors, and their modification to form (Cat)16[Ge2Sb2S7]6[GeS4] (1) and (Cat)6[Sn10O4S20][Sb3S4]2 (2a and 2b), wherein Cat = (C4C1C1Im)+ (1 and 2a) or (C4C1C2Im)+ (2b). In 1, germanium and antimony atoms are combined to form a rare noradamantane&#8208;type ternary molecular anion, six of which surround a [GeS4] unit in a highly symmetric secondary structure, and finally crystallize in a diamond&#8208;like superstructure. In 2, supertetrahedral oxo&#8208;sulfido stannate clusters are generated, as known from the ionothermal treatment of the stannate precursor alone, yet, linked here into unprecedented one&#8208;dimensional strands with {Sb3S4} units as linkers.

      <title>Selective Activation of Aromatic Aldehydes Promoted by Dispersion Interactions: Steric and Electronic Factors of a &#960;&#8208;Pocket within Cage&#8208;Shaped Borates for Molecular Recognition</title>
      <dc:description>Selective bond formations are one of the most important reactions in organic synthesis. In the Lewis acid&#8211;mediated electrophile reactions of carbonyls, the selective formation of a carbonyl&#8211;acid complex has played a critical role in determining selectivity, which is based on the difference in the coordinative interaction between the carbonyl and Lewis acid center. Although this strategy has attained progress in selective bond formations, the discrimination between similarly sized aromatic and aliphatic carbonyls that have no functional anchors to strongly interact with the metal center still remains a challenging issue. In this manuscript, we alternatively focus on the molecular recognition driven by dispersion forces within some aromatic moieties. We designed a Lewis acid catalyst with a&#160;&#960; &#8208;space cavity, which was referred to as a&#160; &#960;  &#8208;pocket  , as the recognition site for aromatic carbonyls. The cage&#8208;shaped borates&#160;  1  B with various&#160; &#960; &#8208;pockets demonstrated significant chemoselectivity for aromatic aldehydes&#160;  3b  &#8211;  f  &#160;over the aliphatic&#160;  3a  &#160;in the competitive hetero Diels&#8208;Alder reactions. The effectiveness of our catalysts was also evidenced by intramolecular recognition of the aromatic carbonyl within a dicarbonyl substrate. The mechanistic and theoretical studies demonstrated that the selective activation of aromatic substrates is driven by the preorganized step with a larger dispersion force rather than the rate&#8208;determining step of the C&#8211;C bond formation, and this likely contributes to the preferred activation of aromatic substrates over aliphatic ones.</dc:description>

      <title>Naphthoquinone&#8208;Dopamine hybrids inhibit&#160;&#945;&#8208;synuclein aggregation, disrupt preformed fibrils and attenuate aggregate&#8208;induced toxicity</title>
      <dc:description>Accumulation and aggregation of the intrinsically disordered protein &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;&#8208;Syn) into amyloid fibrils are hallmarks of a series of heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorders, known as synucleinopathies and most notably Parkinson&#8217;s disease (PD). The crucial role of &#945;&#8208;Syn aggregation in PD makes it an attractive target for the development of disease&#8208;modifying therapeutics that would inhibit &#945;&#8208;Syn aggregation or disrupt its preformed fibrillar assemblies. To that end, we have designed and synthesized two naphthoquinone&#8208;dopamine&#8208;based hybrid small molecules, NQDA and Cl&#8208;NQDA, and demonstrated their ability to inhibit in vitro amyloid formation by &#945;&#8208;Syn using ThT assay, CD, TEM, and Congo red birefringence. Moreover, these hybrid molecules efficiently disassembled preformed fibrils of &#945;&#8208;Syn into non&#8208;toxic species, as evident from LUV leakage assay. NQDA and Cl&#8208;NQDA were found to have low cytotoxicity and they attenuated the toxicity induced by &#945;&#8208;Syn towards SH&#8208;SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. NQDA was found to efficiently cross an in vitro human blood&#8208;brain barrier model. These naphthoquinone&#8208;dopamine based derivatives can be an attractive scaffold for therapeutic design towards PD.</dc:description>

      <title>Insights in LiAlH4 Catalysed Imine Hydrogenation</title>
      <dc:description>Commercial LiAlH4 can be used in catalytic quantities in the hydrogenation of imines to amines with H2. Combined experimental and theoretical investigations give deeper insight in the mechanism and identifies the most likely catalytic cycle. Activity is lost when Li in LiAlH4 is exchanged for Na or K. Exchanging Al for B or Ga also led to dramatically reduced activities. This indicates a heterobimetallic mechanism in which cooperation between Li and Al is crucial. Potential intermediates on the catalytic pathway have been isolated from reactions of MAlH4 (M = Li, Na, K) and different imines. Depending on the imine, double, triple or quadruple imine insertion has been observed. Prolonged reaction of LiAlH4 with PhC(H)=NtBu led to a side&#8208;reaction and gave the double insertion product LiAlH2[N]2 ([N] = N(tBu)CH2Ph) which at higher temperature reacts further by ortho&#8208;metallation of the Ph ring. A DFT study led to a number of conclusions. The most likely catalyst for hydrogenation of PhC(H)=NtBu with LiAlH4 is LiAlH2[N]2. Insertion of a third imine via a heterobimetallic transition state has a barrier of +23.2 kcal/mol (DH). The rate&#8208;determining step is hydrogenolysis of LiAlH[N]3 with H2 with a barrier of +29.2 kcal/mol. In agreement with experiment, replacing Li for Na (or K) and Al for B (or Ga) led to higher calculated barriers. Also, the AlH4&#713; anion showed very high barriers. Calculations support the experimentally observed effects of the imine substituents at C and N: the lowest barriers are calculated for imines with aryl&#8208;substituents at C and alkyl&#8208;substituents at N.</dc:description>

Prolonged reaction of LiAlH4 with PhC(H)=NtBu led to a side&#8208;reaction and gave the double insertion product LiAlH2[N]2 ([N] = N(tBu)CH2Ph) which at higher temperature reacts further by ortho&#8208;metallation of the Ph ring. A DFT study led to a number of conclusions. The most likely catalyst for hydrogenation of PhC(H)=NtBu with LiAlH4 is LiAlH2[N]2. Insertion of a third imine via a heterobimetallic transition state has a barrier of +23.2 kcal/mol (DH). The rate&#8208;determining step is hydrogenolysis of LiAlH[N]3 with H2 with a barrier of +29.2 kcal/mol. In agreement with experiment, replacing Li for Na (or K) and Al for B (or Ga) led to higher calculated barriers. Also, the AlH4&#713; anion showed very high barriers. Calculations support the experimentally observed effects of the imine substituents at C and N: the lowest barriers are calculated for imines with aryl&#8208;substituents at C and alkyl&#8208;substituents at N.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Tunable Synthesis of Hierarchical Yolk/double&#8208;shelled SiOx@TiO2@C Nanospheres for High&#8208;performance Lithium&#8211;ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>We report the preparation of unique hierarchical yolk/double&#8208;shelled SiO  x  @TiO  2  @C nanospheres with different voids by a facile sol&#8211;gel method combined with carbon coating. In preparation process, SiO  x  nanosphere is used as a hard template. Etch time of SiO  x  yolk affects the morphology and electrochemical performance of SiO  x  @TiO  2  @C. With the increase in etch time, the yolk/double&#8208;shelled SiO  x  @TiO  2  @C with 15 and 30 nm voids and the TiO  2  @C hollow nanospheres are obtained. The yolk/double&#8208;shelled SiO  x  @TiO  2  @C nanospheres exhibit a remarkable lithium&#8211;ion batteries&#8217; performance as anodes, including high lithium storage capacity, outstanding rate capability, good reversibility, and stable long&#8208;term cycle life. The unique structure can accommodate the large volume change of the SiO  x  yolk, provide a unique buffering space for the discharge/charge processes, improve the structural stability of the electrode material during repeated Li  +  intercalation/deintercalation processes, and enhance the cycling stability. The SiO  x  @TiO  2  @C with 30 nm void space exhibits a high discharge specific capacity of ~1195.4 mA h g  &#8722;1  at the current density of 0.1 A g  &#8722;1  after 300 cycles and ~701.1 mA h g  &#8722;1  at 1 A g  &#8722;1  for over 800&#160;cycles. &#160; These results suggest that the proposed particle architecture is promising and may have potential applications in improving various high performance anode materials.</dc:description>

      <title>A Novel Peptide Stapling Strategy with Built&#8208;in Fluorescence via Direct Late&#8208;stage C(sp2)&#8208;H Olefination of Tryptophan</title>

Furthermore, as a proof of concept for its biological applications, stapled peptides without additional fluorophore 9a and 9b were constructed for cell imaging study.

      <title>Metal&#8208;free Twofold Electrochemical C&#8208;H Amination of Activated Arenes: Application to Medicinally Relevant Precursor Synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>The efficient production of many medicinally or synthetically important starting materials suffers from wasteful or toxic precursors for the synthesis. In particular, the aromatic non&#8208;protected primary amine function represents a versatile synthetic precursor, but its synthesis typically requires toxic oxidizing agents and transition metal catalysts. The twofold electrochemical amination of activated benzene derivatives via Zincke intermediates provides an alternative sustainable strategy for the formation of new C&#8211;N bonds of high synthetic value. As a proof of concept, we use our approach to generate a benzoxazinone scaffold that gained attention as a starting structure against castrate&#8208;resistance prostate cancer. Further improvement of the structure led to significantly increased cancer cell line toxicity. Thus, exploiting environmentally benign electrooxidation, we present a new versatile and powerful method based on direct C&#8211;H activation that is applicable for e.g. the production of medicinally relevant compounds.</dc:description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Understanding Nucleophilicity and Protophilicity in the SN2/E2 Competition</title>
      <dc:description>The concepts of nucleophilicity and protophilicity are fundamental and ubiquitous in chemistry. A case in point is bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN2) and base&#8208;induced elimination (E2). A Lewis base acting as a strong nucleophile is needed for SN2 reactions, while Lewis base acting as a strong protophile (i.e.&#160;base) is required for E2 reactions. A complicating factor is, however, the fact that a good nucleophile is often a strong protophile. Nevertheless, a sound, physical model that explains, in a transparent manner, when an electron&#8208;rich Lewis base acts as a protophile or a nucleophile, that is not just phenomenological, is currently lacking in the literature. To address this fundamental question, we have explored the potential energy surfaces of the SN2 and E2 reactions of X&#8211;&#160;+ C2H5Y model systems with X, Y = F, Cl, Br, I, and At, using relativistic density functional theory at ZORA&#8208;OLYP/TZ2P. These explorations have yielded a consistent overview of reactivity trends over a wide range in reactivity and pathways. Activation strain analyses of these reactions reveal the factors that determine the shape of the potential energy surfaces and hence govern the propensity of the Lewis base to act as a nucleophile or protophile. We introduce the concepts of "characteristic distortivity" and "transition state acidity" of a reaction, which have the potential to enable chemists to better understand and design reactions for&#160;synthesis.</dc:description>

      <title>Three&#8208;dimensional Cubic and Dice&#8208;like Microstructures of Higher Fullerene C78 with Enhanced Photoelectrochemical and Photoluminescence Properties</title>
      <dc:description>The single&#8208;crystal micro/nanostructures of fullerene species, namely C  60  and C  70  , have been previously studied, but studies on the morphology and properties of higher fullerenes have rarely been reported due to the limited amount of samples and their ellipsoidal isomeric structures.

The micro&#8208;cubes were prepared by regulating the concentration of C  78  in trimethylbenzene (TMB) and the volume ratio of TMB and isopropanol. A simple handshaking process transformed the micro&#8208;cubes into micro&#8208;dice with an open&#8208;hole on each crystal face. X&#8208;ray diffraction and Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopic studies revealed a simple cubic unit cell with a lattice constant of 10.6 &#197; and intercalated TMB molecules in both crystals. The C  78  cubic and dice&#8208;like microstructures exhibited enhanced photoelectrochemical and photoluminescence properties compared with pristine C  78  powder, indicating their potential applications as photodetectors and photoelectric devices.</dc:description>

      <title>Hierarchical carbon nanowires/Ni@MnO2 nanocomposites for high&#8208;performance asymmetric supercapacitors</title>
      <dc:description>In this work, a rational 3D hierarchical carbon cloth/nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanowires/Ni@MnO  2  (CC/N&#8208;CNWs/Ni@MnO  2  ) nanocomposite electrode is successfully designed and prepared by electrodeposition. The   N&#8208;C nanowire  s derived from polypyrrole (PPy) nanowires on the carbon cloth possess open framework structure, which greatly increases the contact area between the electrode and electrolyte and provides short diffusion paths. The incorporation of the Ni layer between the N&#8208;CNWs and MnO  2  is beneficial for significantly enhancing the electrical conductivity and boosting the fast charge transfer as well as improving the charge&#8208;collection capacity. Thus, the as&#8208;prepared 3D hierarchical CC/N&#8208;CNWs/Ni@MnO  2  electrode exhibits a higher specific capacitance of 571.4 F g  &#8208;1  compared with those of CC/N&#8208;CNWs@MnO  2  (311  F g  &#8208;1  ), CC/Ni@MnO  2  (196.6 F g  &#8208;1  ) and CC@MnO  2  (186.1 F g  &#8208;1  ) at 1 A g  &#8208;1  and remarkable rate capability (367.5 F g  &#8208;1  at 10 A g  &#8208;1  ). Moreover, the asymmetric supercapacitors constructed using CC/N&#8208;CNWs/Ni@MnO  2  as a cathode material and activated carbon (AC) as an anode material deliver an impressive energy density of 36.4 Wh kg  &#8208;1  at the power density of 900 W kg  &#8208;1  and a good cycling life (72.8% capacitance retention after 3500 cycles). This study paves a low&#8208;cost and simple way to design a hierarchical nanocomposite electrode with large surface area and superior electrical conductivity, which holds a wide application prospect in high&#8208;performance supercapacitors.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this work, a rational 3D hierarchical carbon cloth/nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanowires/Ni@MnO  2  (CC/N&#8208;CNWs/Ni@MnO  2  ) nanocomposite electrode is successfully designed and prepared by electrodeposition. The   N&#8208;C nanowire  s derived from polypyrrole (PPy) nanowires on the carbon cloth possess open framework structure, which greatly increases the contact area between the electrode and electrolyte and provides short diffusion paths. The incorporation of the Ni layer between the N&#8208;CNWs and MnO  2  is beneficial for significantly enhancing the electrical conductivity and boosting the fast charge transfer as well as improving the charge&#8208;collection capacity. Thus, the as&#8208;prepared 3D hierarchical CC/N&#8208;CNWs/Ni@MnO  2  electrode exhibits a higher specific capacitance of 571.4 F g  &#8208;1  compared with those of CC/N&#8208;CNWs@MnO  2  (311  F g  &#8208;1  ), CC/Ni@MnO  2  (196.6 F g  &#8208;1  ) and CC@MnO  2  (186.1 F g  &#8208;1  ) at 1 A g  &#8208;1  and remarkable rate capability (367.5 F g  &#8208;1  at 10 A g  &#8208;1  ).
