         <title>Easy Production of &#8220;Difficult Peptides&#8221; using Cell&#8208;Free Protein Synthesis and a New Methionine Analogue as a Latent Peptide Cleavage Site</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aliphatic &#947;&#8208;chloro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids incorporated in place of their canonical analogues through cell&#8208;free protein synthesis act as heat&#8208;labile linkers, offering a useful strategy for the straightforward production of target peptides as fusion proteins, from which the targets are readily released. Until now, the natural abundance of aliphatic amino acids in peptides has limited the scope of the method, as it leads to undesired cleavage sites in synthesized products, but here we report the development of a new cleavable chloro amino acid that incorporates in place of the relatively rare amino acid methionine, thus greatly expanding the scope of producible targets. This new strategy is employed for simplified peptide synthesis with a methionine&#8208;free fusion partner, allowing single&#8208;site incorporation of the cleavable linker for clean release and easy purification of the target peptide. Its utility is demonstrated through the straightforward preparation of two peptides reported to be challenging targets and not accessible through standard solid&#8208;phase chemical methodologies, as well as analogues.</dc:description>

         <title>A Lead Mixed Halide with Three Different Coordinated Anions and Strong Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation Response</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals are widely applied in information technology, micro&#8208;manufacturing and medical treatment. Herein, a new lead mixed halide with strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response, Cs3Pb2(CH3COO)2Br3I2, has been designed and rationally synthesized. Cs3Pb2(CH3COO)2Br3I2 represents the rare NLO crystal featuring that three different anions (I&#8208;, Br&#8208; and O2&#8208;) simultaneously coordinate the Pb(II) atom to form a severely distorted [PbBr2I2O2] polyhedron with a large polarizability. Remarkably, Cs3Pb2(CH3COO)2Br3I2 not only exhibits a very strong phase&#8208;matching SHG response of 9&#215;KH2PO4 (KDP), but also possesses a large birefringence (0.27@1064nm) and high laser damage threshold (LDT). The strong SHG effect of Cs3Pb2(CH3COO)2Br3I2 mainly originates from the oriented arrangement of [Pb2Br3I2] chains. This study points out an effective strategy to develop new NLO crystals with strong SHG response.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergy of Iron Doping and Cyano Groups for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production over C3N4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Improving the insufficient  carrier separation  dynamics is still of significant in  carbon  nitride (C  3  N  4  )  research  . Extensive research has been devoted to improving the carrier separation efficiency through a single strategy, while ignoring the  synergistic enhancement  effect produced by coupling two or more conventional strategies. Herein, we reported the fabrication of cyano group&#8208;containing Fe&#8208;doped C  3  N  4  porous materials via direct co&#8208;calcination of iron acetylacetonate and melamine  for  synergistically improving the photocatalytic performance. Iron acetylacetonate can promote the generation  of cyano groups and form Fe&#8208;doping  in C  3  N  4  , thereby increasing the visible&#8208;light absorption and reactive sites.  Further, the internal donor&#8208;acceptor  system formed by cyano groups and Fe&#8208;doped sites promoted charge carrier separation and inhibited the radiation recombination of e  &#8208;  &#8208;h  +  pairs. The optimized photocatalytic activity of Fe&#8208;CN&#8208;2 sample was 4.5 times of bulk C  3  N  4  (BCN).</dc:description>

         <title>Emerging Design Principle of Near&#8208;Infrared Upconversion Sensitizer Based on Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Organic Dye for Enhanced Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Upconversion luminescent (UCL) triggered photodynamic therapy (PDT) affords superior outcome for cancer treatment. However, conventional UCL materials which all work as multiphoton absorption (MPA) process, inevitably need extremely high power density far over the maximum permissible exposure (MPE) to laser. Here, an one&#8208;photon absorption molecular upconversion sensitizer Cy5.5&#8208;Br based on frequency upconversion luminescent (FUCL) is designed for PDT. The unusual super heavy atom effect (SHAE) in Cy5.5&#8208;Br strongly enhance its spin&#8208;orbit coupling (0.23 cm&#8208;1), triplet quantum yield (11.1%) and triplet state lifetime (18.8 &#956;s) while the potential hot&#8208;band absoption of Cy5.5&#8208;Br are well maintained. Importantly, Cy5.5&#8208;Br can efficiently target to the tumour site and kill cancer cells by destroying mitochondria under a biosafety MPE to 808 nm laser. The photostability and antitumor results are obviously superior to that of Stoke process. This work first provide a design criterion for FUCL dyes to realize effective PDT upon a biosafety optical density, possibly being more clinical benefits than conventional MPA materials.</dc:description>

         <title>In situ generation of CoCeSx bimetallic sulfide nanoparticles on graphene composite modified by bi&#8208;pyrene terminated molecular for supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Graphene&#8217;s excellent electrical conductivity benefits from its highly&#8208;conjugated structure. Therefore, the manipulation of graphene&#8217;s electronic and mechanical properties can be realized by controlled destruction of its in&#8208;sheet conjugation system. Herein, we report the preparation of CoCeS  x  &#8208;SA@BPMW@RGO via &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions at molecular level. In detail, sodium alginate was compounded with Co  2+  and Ce  3+  , the composite was loaded onto graphene. The graphene sheets are propped by bi&#8208;pyrene terminated molecular wire (BPMW) to avoid the re&#8208;stacking of the grapheme sheets allow the creation of nanometer&#8208;sized space between them. The BPMW have 33.2&#176; angle between coplanar pyrene group and benzene groups, graphene layers were propped in tilt direction. Finally, the three&#8208;dimensional porous composite was obtained after annealing and vulcanization. The resulting CoCeS  x  &#8208;SA@BPMW@RGO shows excellent electrical conductivity and remarkable cycle stability, and high specific capacitance of 1004 F g  &#8208;1  when the current density is 1 A g  &#8208;1  . The excellent electrochemical performance should benefit from the modification of graphene by BPMW via &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions and synergistic effect resulted from the special structure. Moreover, a solid&#8208;state asymmetric supercapacitor device is fabricated based on the synthesized CoCeS  x  &#8208;SA@BPMW@RGO hybrid, and exhibits a power density of 979 W kg  &#8208;1  at the energy density of 23.96 W h kg  &#8208;1  .</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The ring&#8208;opening difluoromethylation&#8208;halogenation of cyclic(thio)ethers is reported via a simple strategy relying on carbon&#8208;chalcogen bond activation with difluorocarbene. The reaction proceeds through in&#8208;situ protonation of the previously little&#8208;known difluoromethylene oxonium or sulfonium ylide intermediate followed by ring&#8208;opening with halide ion to afford halogenated acyclic difluoromethyl (thio)ethers that can then be employed for further elaboration. TMSCF2X (X = Br, Cl) are unique reagents to achieve this synthetic purpose, which serve as both the difluorocarbene source and the halide ion source.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkyne Aminopalladation/Heck and Suzuki Cascades: An Approach to Tetrasubstituted Enamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Internal alkynes have been used in combination with tosylamides and the Narasaka leaving group to form tetra(hetero)substituted enamines in an aminopalladation cascade reaction. The cascade was terminated either intramolecularly by a Heck reaction or intermolecularly in a Suzuki&#8208;type reaction with a boronic acid.







Abstract
Alkyne aminopalladation reactions starting from tosylamides are reported. The emerging vinylic Pd species are converted either in an intramolecular Heck reaction with olefinic units or in an intermolecular Suzuki reaction by using boronic acids exhibiting broad functional group tolerance. Tetra(hetero)substituted tosylated enamines are obtained in a simple one&#8208;pot process.

         <title>Time&#8208;Resolved Spectroscopy and Electronic Structure of Mono&#8208;and Dinuclear Pyridyl&#8208;Triazole/DPEPhos&#8208;Based Cu(I) Complexes</title>

         <dc:description>
The comprehensive results on two mononuclear pyridyl&#8208;triazole/DPEPhos based Cu(I) complexes and its extension to their two dinuclear analogues paves the road to addressing the complex coupling of the respective monomeric units, involving various physical and chemical properties as charge, (electronic) structure and (long&#8208;lived) excited state properties, relevant for applications.







Abstract
Chemical and spectroscopic characterization of the mononuclear photosensitizers [(DPEPhos)Cu(I)(MPyrT)]0/+ (CuL, CuLH) and their dinuclear analogues (Cu2L&#8217;, Cu2L'H2), backed by (TD)DFT and high&#8208;level GW&#8208;Bethe&#8208;Salpeter equation calculations, exemplifies the complex influence of charge, nuclearity and structural flexibility on UV&#8208;induced photophysical pathways. Ultrafast transient absorption and step&#8208;scan FTIR spectroscopy reveal flattening distortion in the triplet state of CuLH as controlled by charge, which also appears to have a large impact on the symmetry of the long&#8208;lived triplet states in Cu2L&#8217; and Cu2L'H2. Time&#8208;resolved luminescence spectroscopy (solid state), supported by transient photodissociation spectroscopy (gas phase), confirm a lifetime of some tens of &#956;s for the respective triplet states, as well as the energetics of thermally activated delayed luminescence, both being essential parameters for application of these materials based on earth&#8208;abundant copper in photocatalysis and luminescent devices.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Electrolyte Design for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Prospect and Challenges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The application of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) in cold regions and seasons is limited seriously due to the decreased Li+ transportation capability and sudden decline in performance. Here, an insightful viewpoint on the low&#8208;temperature electrolyte development and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) effect is given and a new insight about the Li+ solvation structure to understand the interfacial behaviors at the low temperature, aiming to guide the low&#8208;temperature electrolyte design more effectively is presented.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries have dominated the energy market from portable electronic devices to electric vehicles. However, the LIBs applications are limited seriously when they were operated in the cold regions and seasons if there is no thermal protection. This is because the Li+ transportation capability within the electrode and particularly in the electrolyte dropped significantly due to the decreased electrolyte liquidity, leading to a sudden decline in performance and short cycle&#8208;life. Thus, design a low&#8208;temperature electrolyte becomes ever more important to enable the further applications of LIBs. Herein, we summarize the low&#8208;temperature electrolyte development from the aspects of solvent, salt, additives, electrolyte analysis, and performance in the different battery systems. Then, we also introduce the recent new insight about the cation solvation structure, which is significant to understand the interfacial behaviors at the low temperature, aiming to guide the design of a low&#8208;temperature electrolyte more effectively.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Phase Cyclohexene Oxidation with O2 over Spray&#8208;Flame&#8208;Synthesized La1&#8722;xSrxCoO3 Perovskite Nanoparticles</title>

         <dc:description>
A complex for a complex reaction: La1&#8722;xSrxCoO3 nanoparticles were prepared by spray&#8208;flame synthesis and applied in the liquid&#8208;phase oxidation of cyclohexene with molecular O2. An optimum Sr doping of 20&#8197;at.&#8201;% &#8211; with balanced amounts of oxygen vacancies and Co2+ cations &#8211; was found to be beneficial for cyclohexene conversion. In situ ATR&#8208;IR and EPR spectroscopy verified the complex radical reaction network.







Abstract
La1&#8722;xSrxCoO3 (x=0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) nanoparticles were prepared by spray&#8208;flame synthesis and applied in the liquid&#8208;phase oxidation of cyclohexene with molecular O2 as oxidant under mild conditions. The catalysts were systematically characterized by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques. With increasing Sr content, the concentration of surface oxygen vacancy defects increases, which is beneficial for cyclohexene oxidation, but the surface concentration of less active Co2+ was also increased. However, Co2+ cations have a superior activity towards peroxide decomposition, which also plays an important role in cyclohexene oxidation. A Sr doping of 20 at.&#8201;% was found to be the optimum in terms of activity and product selectivity. The catalyst also showed excellent reusability over three catalytic runs; this can be attributed to its highly stable particle size and morphology. Kinetic investigations revealed first&#8208;order reaction kinetics for temperatures between 60 and 100&#8201;&#176;C and an apparent activation energy of 68&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for cyclohexene oxidation. Moreover, the reaction was not affected by the applied O2 pressure in the range from 10 to 20&#8197;bar. In situ attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy was used to monitor the conversion of cyclohexene and the formation of reaction products including the key intermediate cyclohex&#8208;2&#8208;ene&#8208;1&#8208;hydroperoxide; spin trap electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy provided strong evidence for a radical reaction pathway by identifying the cyclohexenyl alkoxyl radical.

         <title>Terminal Ligand and Packing Effects on Slow Relaxation in an Isostructural Set of [Dy(H2dapp)X2]+ Single Molecule Magnets**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three new dysprosium complexes with a pentadentate ligand occupying five equatorial sites differ only in the nature of the axial ligands. These help tune the relaxation properties as judged by an analysis of the AC susceptibility data. More in depth analysis by using two recently suggested fitting equations lead to similar outcomes for all three systems. As a further contribution to the relaxation pathway involving the phonon bath it is concluded that a short nitrate&#8208;nitrate interaction between molecules helps dampen the spin phonon coupling.







Abstract
We report three structurally related single ion Dy compounds using the pentadentate ligand 2,6&#8208;bis((E)&#8208;1&#8208;(2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;hydrazineylidene)ethyl)pyridine (H2dapp) [Dy(H2dapp)(NO3)2]NO3 (1), [Dy(H2dapp)(OAc)2]Cl (2) and [Dy(H2dapp)(NO3)2]Cl0.92(NO3)0.08 (3). The (H2dapp) occupies a helical twisted pentagonal equatorial arrangement with two anionic ligands in the axial positions. Further influence on the electronic and magnetic structure is provided by a closely associated counterion interacting with the central N&#8722;H group of the (H2dapp). The slow relaxation of the magnetisation shows that the anionic acetates give the greatest slowing down of the magnetisation reversal. Further influence on the relaxation properties of compounds1 and 2 is the presence of short nitrate&#8208;nitrate intermolecular ligand contact opening further lattice relaxation pathways.

         <title>Local Field Induced Mass Transfer: New Insight into Nano&#8208;electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using nanocatalysts proves to be a promising way of promoting the performance of electrocatalytic reactions. In this Concept, we provide a brief review of the recent progress of new physics in nano&#8208;electrocatalysis, that is, local&#8208;field&#8208;induced mass transfer (LMT), and highlight new insights into LMT in the future design of nano&#8208;electrocatalysts.







Abstract
Unravelling the complex kinetics of electrocatalysis is essential for the design of electrocatalysts with high performance. Mass transfer and electron transfer are two primary factors that need to be optimized in order to enhance electrocatalytic reactions. The use of nanocatalysts proves to be a promising way of promoting the performance of electrocatalytic reactions, this improvement is usually attributed to their ability to enhance electron transfer. However, when catalysts are taken down to the nanoscale, their size is comparable to the thickness of an electrical double layer, so any curvature can lead to an inhomogeneous local electric field on the electrode, which then changes the mass transfer essentially. In this article, we introduce the new concept of local&#8208;field&#8208;induced mass transfer in nano&#8208;electrocatalytic systems, and provide a brief review of recent progress, revealing its effect on nano&#8208;electrocatalysis, which may bring new insight into the future design of nano&#8208;electrocatalysts.

         <title>Rigid, Highly Reactive and Stable DOTA&#8208;like Tags Containing a Thiol&#8208;Specific Phenylsulfonyl Pyridine Moiety for Protein Modification and NMR Analysis**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing a meta&#8208;Br in pyridine greatly enhances the reactivity of the phenylsulfonyl pyridine moiety towards the free thiol group in a protein, which makes the protein ligation reaction completed within a couple of hours under physiological conditions. The high performance of these phenylsulfonyl pyridine tags in site&#8208;specific labeling of proteins have been demonstrated in a number of proteins.Rigid, Highly Reactive and Stable DOTA&#8208;like Tags Containing a Thiol&#8208;Specific Phenylsulfonyl Pyridine Moiety for Protein Modification and NMR Analysis (Su et&#8197;al.)







Abstract
Site specific installation of a paramagnetic ion with magnetic anisotropy in a biomolecule generates valuable structural restraints, such as pseudocontact shifts (PCSs) and residual dipolar couplings (RDCs). These paramagnetic effects can be used to characterize the structures, interactions and dynamics of biological macromolecules and their complexes. Two single&#8208;armed DOTA&#8208;like tags, BrPSPy&#8208;DO3M(S)A&#8208;Ln and BrPSPy&#8208;6M&#8208;DO3M(S)A&#8208;Ln, each containing a thiol&#8208;specific reacting group, that is, a phenylsulfonyl pyridine moiety, are demonstrated as rigid, reactive and stable paramagnetic tags for protein modification by formation of a reducing resistant thioether bond between the protein and the tag. The two tags present high reactivity with the solvent exposed thiol group in aqueous solution at room temperature. The introduction of Br at the meta&#8208;position in pyridine enhances the reactivity of 4&#8208;phenylsulfonyl pyridine towards the solvent exposed thiol group in a protein, whereas the ortho&#8208;methyl group in pyridine increases the rigidity of the tag in the protein conjugates. The high performance of these two tags has been demonstrated in different cysteine mutants of ubiquitin and GB1. The high reactivity and rigidity of these two tags can be added in the toolbox of paramagnetic tags suitable for the high&#8208;resolution NMR measurements of biological macromolecules and their complexes.

         <title>Engineering of Silicon Core&#8208;Shell Structures for Li&#8208;ion Anodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The core&#8208;shell architecture has been recognized as one of the most promising solutions to enable higher silicon content in Li&#8208;ion anodes. In this review, we report different types of coatings on silicon particles including carbon, inorganic, organic and double&#8208;layer shells from some selected examples. The synthesis methods, structure characterization, main properties and resulting electrochemical performance are outlined. Improvements over silicon are decrypted and trends for future works are objectively identified.







Abstract
The amount of silicon in anode materials for Li&#8208;ion batteries is still limited by the huge volume changes during charge&#8208;discharge cycles. Such changes lead to the loss of electrical contacts, as well as mechanical and surface electrolyte interphase (SEI) instabilities, strongly reducing the cycle life. Core&#8208;shell structures have attracted a vast research interest due to the possibility of modifying some properties with a judicious choice of the shell. It is, for example, possible to improve the electronic conductivity and ionic diffusion, or buffer volume variations. This review gives a comprehensive overview of the recent developments and the different strategies used for the design, synthesis and electrochemical performance of silicon&#8208;based core&#8208;shells. It is based on a selection of the main types of silicon coatings reported in the literature, including carbon, inorganic, organic and double&#8208;layer coatings, Finally, a summary of the advantages and drawbacks of these different types of core&#8208;shells as anode materials for Li&#8208;ion batteries and some insightful suggestions in regards to their use are provided.

         <title>Perfluorinated Trialkoxysilanol with Dramatically Increased Br&#248;nsted Acidity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorine makes the difference: The Br&#248;nsted acidity of tris&#8208;(tert&#8208;butoxy)silanol dramatically increases when the substituents are decorated by 27 fluorine atoms.







Abstract
The Br&#248;nsted acidity of the perfluorinated trialkoxysilanol {(F3C)3CO}3SiOH is more than 13 orders of magnitude higher than that of orthosilicic acid, Si(OH)4, and even more for most previously known silanols. It is easily deprotonated by simple amines and pyridines to give the conjugate silanolates [OSi{OC(CF3)3}3]&#8722;, which possess extremely short Si&#8722;O bonds, comparable to those of silanones.

It is easily deprotonated by simple amines and pyridines to give the conjugate silanolates [OSi{OC(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, which possess extremely short Si&#8722;O bonds, comparable to those of silanones.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Giant Shape&#8208;Persistent Tetrahedral Porphyrin System: Light&#8208;Induced Charge Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Giant multichromophore: A tetrahedral shape&#8208;persistent supramolecular structure has been fully characterised in the solid state (by X&#8208;ray diffraction) and in solution (by NMR, electrochemical and photophysical analysis). Excitation of either the scaffold (blue in the image) or the peripheral ruthenium porphyrins results in an ultrafast photoinduced electron transfer from the ruthenium porphyrins to the scaffold.







Abstract
Tetraphenylmethane appended with four pyridylpyridinium units works as a scaffold to self&#8208;assemble four ruthenium porphyrins in a tetrahedral shape&#8208;persistent giant architecture. The resulting supramolecular structure has been characterised in the solid state by X&#8208;ray single crystal analysis and in solution by various techniques. Multinuclear NMR spectroscopy confirms the 1&#8201;:&#8201;4 stoichiometry with the formation of a highly symmetric structure. The self&#8208;assembly process can be monitored by changes of the redox potentials, as well as by modifications in the visible absorption spectrum of the ruthenium porphyrin and by a complete quenching of both the bright fluorescence of the tetracationic scaffold and the weak phosphorescence of the ruthenium porphyrin. An ultrafast photoinduced electron transfer is responsible for this quenching process. The lifetime of the resulting charge separated state (800&#8197;ps) is about four times longer in the giant supramolecular structure compared to the model 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex formed by the ruthenium porphyrin and a single pyridylpyridinium unit. Electron delocalization over the tetrameric pyridinium structure is likely to be responsible for this effect.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a systematic study of halogenate(I/III) anions with polyatomic ligands. The bis(perfluoro&#8208;  tert  &#8208;butoxy) halogenates(I) [X(OC  4  F  9  )  2  ]  &#8722;  , X = Cl, Br, I, of chlorine, bromine, and iodine are prepared as their tetraethylammonium salts and characterized with IR, Raman and NMR spectroscopic methods as well as single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Spectroscopical data are supported by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. Additionally, the bonding situation of the species in question are analyzed and discussed. Furthermore, we studied the oxidation to the corresponding halogenate(III) derivatives. For [Br(OC  4  F  9  )  2  ]  &#8722;  oxidation with elemental fluorine yielded [BrF  2  (OC  4  F  9  )  2  ]  &#8722;  . Iodide was directly oxidized by ClOC  4  F  9  to the I  III  species [I(OC  4  F  9  )  4  ]  &#8722;  which is a surprisingly inert anion that might be used as a weakly coordinating anion (WCA) in the future. For [Cl(OC  4  F  9  )  2  ]  &#8722;  the decomposition products of the synthetic approaches towards a chlorine(III) system were analyzed.</dc:description>

         <title>Saturated Boronic Acids, Boronates, and Trifluoroborates: An Update on Their Synthetic and Medicinal Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organoboron compounds. The chemistry of saturated boronic acids, boronates, and trifluoroborates is reviewed. Applications of the title compounds in the design of boron&#8208;containing drugs and as tools to construct C(sp3)&#8722;C and C(sp3)&#8208;heteroatom bonds are discussed. The current state of the art in the synthesis of saturated boronic derivatives is described, with a special focus on methodologies developed over the last decade.







Abstract
This review discusses recent advances in the chemistry of saturated boronic acids, boronates, and trifluoroborates. Applications of the title compounds in the design of boron&#8208;containing drugs are surveyed, with special emphasis on &#945;&#8208;amino boronic derivatives. A general overview of saturated boronic compounds as modern tools to construct C(sp3)&#8722;C and C(sp3)&#8208;heteroatom bonds is given, including recent developments in the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura and Chan&#8208;Lam cross&#8208;couplings, single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer processes including metallo&#8208; and organocatalytic photoredox reactions, and transformations of boron &#8220;ate&#8221; complexes. Finally, an attempt to summarize the current state of the art in the synthesis of saturated boronic acids, boronates, and trifluoroborates is made, with a brief mention of the &#8220;classical&#8221; methods (transmetallation of organolithium/magnesium reagents with boron species, anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroboration of alkenes, and the modification of alkenyl boron compounds) and a special focus on recent methodologies (boronation of alkyl (pseudo)halides, derivatives of carboxylic acids, alcohols, and primary amines, boronative C&#8722;H activation, novel approaches to alkene hydroboration, and 1,2&#8208;metallate&#8208;type rearrangements).

         <title>A Series of Iron(II)&#8208;NHC Sensitizers with Remarkable Power Conversion Efficiency in Photoelectrochemical Cells**
</title>

         <dc:description>
A Fe(II)NHC sensitizer bearing a dimethoxyphenyl group on the ancillary ligand scored the highest efficiency ever reported for an iron&#8208;sensitized solar cell (1.83&#8201;%) using Mg2+ and NBu4I&#8208;based electrolyte and a thick 20&#8197;&#956;m TiO2 anode.







Abstract
A series of six new Fe(II)NHC&#8208;carboxylic sensitizers with their ancillary ligand decorated with functions of varied electronic properties have been designed with the aim to increase the metal&#8208;to&#8208; surface charge separation and light harvesting in iron&#8208;based dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). ARM130 scored the highest efficiency ever reported for an iron&#8208;sensitized solar cell (1.83&#8201;%) using Mg2+ and NBu4I&#8208;based electrolyte and a thick 20&#8197;&#956;m TiO2 anode. Computational modelling, transient absorption spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) revealed that the electronic properties induced by the dimethoxyphenyl&#8208;substituted NHC ligand of ARM130 led to the best combination of electron injection yield and spectral sensitivity breadth.

An asymmetric rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond addition to aldimines followed by subsequent intramolecular cyclization to form chiral isoindolinones has been achieved by using a chiral directing group. Various substituted benzamides and aldimines have been smoothly transformed to the corresponding products in up to 68&#8201;% yield with up to 93&#8201;%&#8201;ee.







Abstract
By using a chiral directing group, an asymmetric rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond addition to aldimines followed by intramolecular cyclization to form chiral isoindolinones has been achieved (up to 68&#8201;% yield, up to 93&#8201;%&#8201;ee). A three&#8208;component variant that resembles Mannich reaction was also realized (41&#8201;% yield, 83&#8201;%&#8201;ee). Product elaborations and preliminary mechanistic studies were described.

Designer Ligand: Cyclophanyl (hetero)bimetal complexes with a focus on Metal&#8208;to&#8208;Metal distance modulation by bridging ligand design are highlighted. Employing the co&#8208;facially stacked cyclophanyl&#8208;derived pseudo&#8208;geminal, &#8208;ortho, &#8208;meta, and &#8208;para constitutional isomers grafted with N&#8208;, O&#8208;, and P&#8208; containing chelates allow the installation of diverse (hetero)metallic moieties in a distance&#8208;defined and spatially&#8208;oriented relation that are crucial factors, contribute to the tuning of structure&#8208;property relation and cooperative effects in catalysis as well as emerging material applications.







Abstract
Multinuclear metal complexes have seen tremendous progress in synthetic advances, their versatile structural features, and emerging applications. Here, we conceptualize Metal&#8208;to&#8208;Metal distance modulation in cyclophanyl metal complexes by bridging ligand design employing the co&#8208;facially stacked cyclophanyl&#8208;derived pseudo&#8208;geminal, &#8208;ortho, &#8208;meta, and &#8208;para constitutional isomers grafted with N&#8208;, O&#8208;, and P&#8208; containing chelates that allow the installation of diverse (hetero)metallic moieties in a distance&#8208;defined and spatially&#8208;oriented relation to one another. Metal&#8208;to&#8208;Metal distance modulation and innate transannular &#8220;through&#8208;space&#8221; &#960;&#8211;&#960; electronic interactions via the co&#8208;facially stacked benzene rings in cyclophanyl&#8208;derived complexes as well as their specific stereochemical structural features (element of planar chirality) are crucial factors that contribute to the tuning of structure&#8208;property relationships, which stand at the very center from the perspective of cooperative effects in catalysis as well as emerging material applications.

         <title>Tailoring the Properties of Optical Force Probes for Polymer Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent years, notable works on adjusting optical force probes in their responses to energy (both light and force), in time, and in their spatially detectable resolution have been published and help unraveling the macroscopic with relation to the molecular mechanical properties of polymer materials. Here, notable examples that put a dent in the universe of optical force sensing are highlighted.







Abstract
The correlation of mechanical properties of polymer materials with those of their molecular constituents is the foundation for their holistic comprehension and eventually for improved material designs and syntheses. Over the last decade, optical force probes (OFPs) were developed, shedding light on various unique mechanical behaviors of materials. The properties of polymers are diverse, ranging from soft hydrogels to ultra&#8208;tough composites, from purely elastic rubbers to viscous colloidal solutions, and from transparent glasses to super black dyed coatings. Only very recently, researchers started to develop tailored OFP solutions that account for such material requirements in energy (both light and force), in time, and in their spatially detectable resolution. We here highlight notable recent examples and identify future challenges in this emergent field.

         <title>A Perspective on Heterogeneous Catalysts for the Selective Oxidation of Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metals and oxides are two important types of heterogeneous catalysts applied in selective alcohol oxidation under thermal, electrocatalytic and photocatalytic conditions. Considering the intrinsic differences in these methods, different approaches exist to prepare the catalysts and study them under such reaction conditions. In this minireview, important advances and the remaining challenges for more in&#8208;depth characterization of the above&#8208;mentioned catalysts are described to provide a perspective for future works in the field of selective alcohol oxidation.







Abstract
Selective oxidation of higher alcohols using heterogeneous catalysts is an important reaction in the synthesis of fine chemicals with added value. Though the process for primary alcohol oxidation is industrially established, there is still a lack of fundamental understanding considering the complexity of the catalysts and their dynamics under reaction conditions, especially when higher alcohols and liquid&#8208;phase reaction media are involved. Additionally, new materials should be developed offering higher activity, selectivity, and stability. This can be achieved by unraveling the structure&#8211;performance correlations of these catalysts under reaction conditions. In this regard, researchers are encouraged to develop more advanced characterization techniques to address the complex interplay between the solid surface, the dissolved reactants, and the solvent. In this mini&#8208;review, we report some of the most important approaches taken in the field and give a perspective on how to tackle the complex challenges for different approaches in alcohol oxidation while providing insight into the remaining challenges.

         <title>Early Physical Organic Chemistry: Nikolai Aleksandrovich Menshutkin (1842&#8211;1907) and Reaction Velocities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Forgotten history: Nikolai Aleksandrovich Menshutkin was a multifaceted chemist who systematically applied kinetics to the study of the effects of reactant structure on the rate of esterification of alcohols with carboxylic acids, and the quaternization of amines with alkylhalides. These last reactions gave evidence of an element effect and dramatic solvent effects.







Abstract
The name of Menshutkin is most frequently associated with his eponymous reaction (the quaternization of tertiary amines with alkyl halides). However, he made encyclopedic contributions to the field of reaction kinetics, where he carried out extensive studies of the effects of reactant structure on the rates of esterification of monohydric, dihydric and trihydric alcohols with monocarboxylic acids, and monobasic and dibasic carboxylic acids and anhydrides with monohydric alcohols. In these studies, he deduced an order of reactivity of alcohols in esterification on the basis of their reactions with acetic acid, and the effects of acid structure on the rates of esterification based on the reaction of the carboxylic acid with isobutyl alcohol. When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols. The wide&#8208;ranging work of Menshutkin, the physical organic chemist, is discussed.

         <title>Electronic Structure and Superconductivity of Compressed Metal Tetrahydrides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exotic physical properties are often exhibited by compounds crystallizing in the ubiquitous ThCr2Si2 structure type illustrated in the picture. A plethora of metal tetrahydrides belonging to this family, with metal cations, H&#8208; and quasimolecular H2 units, have been synthesized in diamond anvil cells and/or predicted to be stable under pressure. A theoretical investigation unveils why some are superconducting, whereas others are not. More information can be found in the Full Paper by T. Bi and E. Zurek (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102679).

         <title>Synergistic Peptide and Gold Catalysis: Enantioselective Addition of Branched Aldehydes to Allenamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic combination of a tripeptide and a gold complex catalyzes the enantioselective addition between branched aldehydes and allenamides to furnish synthetically versatile &#947;,&#948;&#8208;enamide aldehydes with a fully substituted stereogenic center. Mechanistic studies offered key insights into the role of the peptide and acid/base additives.







Abstract
The combination of a peptide catalyst and a gold catalyst is presented for enantioselective addition reactions between branched aldehydes and allenamides. The two catalysts act in concert to provide &#947;,&#948;&#8208;enamide aldehydes bearing a fully substituted, benzylic stereogenic center &#8211; a structural motif common in many natural products and therapeutically active compounds &#8211; with good yields and enantioselectivities. The reaction tolerates a variety of alkyl and alkoxy substituted aldehydes and the products can be elaborated into several chiral building blocks bearing either 1,4&#8208; or 1,5&#8208; functional group relationships. Mechanistic studies showed that the conformational features of the peptide are important for both the catalytic efficiency and stereochemistry, while a balance of acid/base additives is key for ensuring formation of the desired product over undesired side reactions.

         <title>Synergy of Bi2O3 and RuO2 nanocatalysts for low&#8208;overpotential and wide pH&#8208;window electrochemical ammonia synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) under ambient conditions is still seriously impeded by the inferior NH3  yield and low Faradic efficiency, especially at low overpotentials. Herein, we report the synthesis of nano&#8208;sized RuO2  and Bi2O3  particles grown on functionalized exfoliated graphene (FEG) through in&#8208;situ electrodeposition, denoted as RuO2&#8208;Bi2O3/FEG. The prepared self&#8208;supporting RuO2&#8208;Bi2O3/FEG hybrid with a Bi mass loading of 0.70 wt% and Ru mass loading of 0.04 wt% shows excellent NRR performance at low overpotentials in acidic, neutral and alkaline electrolytes. It achieves a large NH  3  yield of 4.58 &#177; 0.16 &#956;gNH3h&#8208;1cm&#8208;2  with a high Faradaic efficiency of 14.6% at &#8208;0.2 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode in 0.1 M Na2SO4  electrolyte. This performance benefits from the synergistic effect between Bi2O3  and RuO2  which respectively have a fairly strong interaction of Bi 6p orbitals with the N 2p band and abundant supply of *H, as well as the binder&#8208;free characteristic and the convenient electron transfer via graphene nanosheets. This work highlights a new electrocatalyst design strategy that combines transition and main&#8208;group metal elements, which may provide some inspirations for designing low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance NRR electrocatalysts in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Non&#8208;Aqueous Neptunium(III) Halide Solvates from NpO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two Np (III) halides, NpI 3 (THF) 4 and NpBr 3 (THF) 4 , have been prepared and isolated in high yields as described in this work. Starting with neptunia (NpO 2 ), NpCl 4 (DME) 2 was first generated in an updated, higher yielding synthesis than what was previously reported using HCl/HF. This material was then reduced with KC 8 , followed by subsequent ligand exchange, to generate NpBr 3 (THF) 4 and NpI 3 &#8208;(THF) 4 . Full characterization by single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography, 1 H NMR spectroscopy and electronic absorption spectroscopy confirmed the molecular formulas and oxidation states. These trivalent materials are straightforward to synthesize and can be used as starting materials for non&#8208;aqueous Np(III) chemistry, obviating the need for rare and restricted Np metal and elemental halogens.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The current review describes advances in the use of fluorescent 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole (BTD) derivatives after nearly one decade since the first description of bioimaging experiments using this class of fluorogenic dyes. The review describes the use of BTD&#8208;containing fluorophores applied as, inter alia, bioprobes for imaging cell nuclei, mitochondria, lipid droplets, sensors, markers for proteins and related events, biological processes and activities, lysosomes, plasma membranes, multicellular models, and animals. A number of physicochemical and photophysical properties commonly observed for BTD fluorogenic structures are also described.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Several urea&#8208;inserted organo&#8208;polyoxometalates (POMs) derived from polyoxotungstovanadate [P  2  V  3  W  15  O  61  ]  9&#8211;  were prepared. The insertion of the carbonyl into the polyoxometallic framework activates the urea toward Hydrogen&#8208;bond catalysis. This was shown on the Friedel&#8208;Crafts arylation of  trans  &#8208;&#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene. Modelling shows that the most stable form of the organo&#8208;POMs features a  cis&#8208;trans  arrangement of the two N&#8211;H bonds, but that the likely catalytically active  trans&#8208;trans  form is accessible at room temperature. Finally, it is possible that the oxo substituents next to the vanadium atoms may help the approach of the nucleophile via H&#8208;bonding.</dc:description>

         <title>Manipulation of Organic Afterglow via Thermodynamic and Kinetic Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fabrication of room&#8208;temperature organic phosphorescence and afterglow materials, as well as the transformation of their photophysical properties, has emerged as an important topic in the research field of luminescent materials. Here we report the establishment of energy landscape in dopant&#8208;matrix organic afterglow systems where the aggregation states of luminescent dopants can be controlled by doping concentrations in the matrices and the material preparation methods. Through the manipulation via thermodynamic and kinetic control, dopant&#8208;matrix afterglow materials with different aggregation states and diverse afterglow properties can be obtained. The conversion from metastable aggregation state to thermodynamic stable aggregation state of the dopant&#8208;matrix afterglow materials have been found to lead to the emergence of intriguing afterglow transformation behaviors triggered by thermal and solvent annealing. The reversible afterglow transformation process that is thermodynamically unfavorable can also be achieved by coupling the dopant&#8208;matrix afterglow system to mechanical forces.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Transformations of NH&#8208;Sulfoximines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review considered recent progress and achievements in the synthesis and transformation of NH&#8208;sulfoximines. The development of strategies for direct and selective preparation of NH&#8208;sulfoximines, even in enantioenriched form or by using sustainable approaches and continuous flow synthesis, are reported. Transformations of sulfoximines by N&#8722;S, N&#8722;P, N&#8722;C bond forming processes and cyclization reactions are also covered.







Abstract
Recent years have seen a marked increase in the occurrence of sulfoximines in the chemical sciences, often presented as valuable motifs for medicinal chemistry. This has been prompted by both pioneering works taking sulfoximine containing compounds into clinical trials and the concurrent development of powerful synthetic methods. This review covers recent developments in the synthesis of sulfoximines concentrating on developments since 2015. This includes extensive developments in both S&#8722;N and S&#8722;C bond formations. Flow chemistry processes for sulfoximine synthesis are also covered. Finally, subsequent transformations of sulfoximines, particularly in N&#8208;functionalization are reviewed, including N&#8722;S, N&#8722;P, N&#8722;C bond forming processes and cyclization reactions.

         <title>Elucidating Inner Workings of Naturally Sourced Organic Optoelectronic Materials with Ultrafast Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic optoelectronics: Naturally sourced organic chromophores with photosensitivity have enabled a variety of sustainable optoelectronics for light harvesting, transistors, and light&#8208;emitting diodes with broad societal benefits. To facilitate the rational design, ultrafast electronic and vibrational spectroscopy provides a powerful toolset to gain fundamental insights into the working mechanisms of these organic &#8220;molecular machines&#8221; from solution to thin films, aiming to improve the relevant device performance.







Abstract
Recent advances in sustainable optoelectronics including photovoltaics, light&#8208;emitting diodes, transistors, and semiconductors have been enabled by &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic molecules. A fundamental understanding of light&#8208;matter interactions involving these materials can be realized by time&#8208;resolved electronic and vibrational spectroscopies. In this Minireview, the photoinduced mechanisms including charge/energy transfer, electronic (de)localization, and excited&#8208;state proton transfer are correlated with functional properties encompassing optical absorption, fluorescence quantum yield, conductivity, and photostability. Four naturally derived molecules (xylindein, dimethylxylindein, alizarin, indigo) with ultrafast spectral insights showcase efficient energy dissipation involving H&#8208;bonding networks and proton motions, which yield high photostability. Rational design principles derived from such investigations could increase the efficiency for light harvesting, triplet formation, and photosensitivity for improved and versatile optoelectronic performance.

         <title>Redox Isomerization/(3+2) Allenoate Annulation by Auto&#8208;Tandem Phosphine Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tandem catalysis allows a single catalyst to engage in two mechanistically distinct catalytic processes. While such approaches using transition metal catalysts are developed, they are less so in the field of organocatalysis. The use of a single phosphine catalyst is reported that mediates the redox isomerization of amino crotonates to give imines which then undergo (3+2) annulation with a range of allenoates in a second phosphine catalyzed process. Computational studies indicate that pivotal to the success of this reaction is the use of catalysts with similar ability to add to both allenoate and crotonate.







Abstract
A phosphine&#8208;catalyzed approach to pyrrolines has been developed that involves two mechanistically unlinked catalytic processes. The first involves the redox isomerization of amino crotonates to provide access to aliphatic tosyl imines, which then engage in a (3+2) annulation with various allenoates. The reaction shows generality, with 24 examples established, along with a low yielding and moderately enantioselective variant. Mechanistic studies indicate that the viability of the process is linked to the selection of catalysts with similar propensity to add to the two coupling partners.

         <title>Stepwise Increase of NdIII&#8208;Based Phosphorescence by AIE&#8208;Active Sensitizer: Broadening the AIPE Family from Transition Metals to Discrete Near&#8208;Infrared Lanthanide Complexes**

With help of antenna effect, the excitation energies of the AIE&#8208;active sensitizers are enhanced while transferring into the inert NdIII excited state through 3LMCT. Further beneficial from the structural rigidification, AIE&#8208;active L as sensitizers possessed matched energy to NdIII, less non&#8208;radiative process, and low excitation window by twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT), thus affording the first AIPE&#8208;active discrete NIR&#8208;emitting lanthanide complexes with the longest lifetimes among NdIII&#8208;based complexes containing C&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
We designed two near&#8208;infrared (NIR) lanthanide complexes [(L)2&#8208;Nd(NO3)3] (L=TPE2&#8208;BPY for 1, TPE&#8208;BPY for 2) by employing aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active tetraphenylethylene (TPE) derivatives as sensitizers, which possessed matched energy to NdIII, prevented competitive deactivation under aggregation, even shifted the excitation window toward 600&#8197;nm by twisted intramolecular charge transfer. Furthermore, benefiting from the 4&#8201;f electron shielding effect and antenna effect, the enhanced excitation energies of the AIE&#8208;active sensitizers by structural rigidification transferred into the inert NdIII excited state through 3LMCT, affording the first aggregation&#8208;induced phosphorescence enhancement (AIPE)&#8208;active discrete NIR&#8208;emitting lanthanide complexes. As 1 equipped with more AIE&#8208;active TPE than 2, L&#8594;Nd energy transfer efficiency in the former was higher than that in the latter under the same conditions. Consequently, the crystal of 1 exhibited one of the longest lifetimes (9.69&#8197;&#956;s) among NdIII&#8208;based complexes containing C&#8722;H bonds.

         <title>The Role of Common Alcoholic Sacrificial Agents in Photocatalysis: Is It Always Trivial?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Making sacrifices: A good sacrificial agent in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction is not only determined by its rate of reaction with the holes, but also by the nature of products that can compete with the desired catalytic reaction and reduce its efficiency.







Abstract
Photocatalytic hydrogen production is proposed as a sustainable energy source. Simultaneous reduction and oxidation of water is a complex multistep reaction with high overpotential. Photocatalytic processes involving semiconductors transfer electrons from the valence band to the conduction band. Sacrificial substrates that react with the photochemically formed holes in the valence band are often used to study the mechanism of H2 production, as they scavenge the holes and hinder charge carrier recombination (electron&#8208;hole pairs). Here, we show that the desired sacrificial agent is one forming a radical that is a fairly strong reducing agent, and whose oxidized form is not a good electron acceptor that might suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In an acidic medium, methanol was found to fulfill both these requirements better than ethanol and propan&#8208;2&#8208;ol in the TiO2&#8208;(M0&#8208;NPs) (M=Au or Pt) system, whereas in an alkaline medium, the alcohols exhibit a reverse order of activity. Moreover, we report that CH2(OH)2 is by far the most efficient sacrificial agent in a nontrivial mechanism in acidic media. Our study provides general guidelines for choosing an appropriate sacrificial substrate and helps to explain the variance in the performance of alcohol scavenger&#8208;based photocatalytic systems.

         <title>Additive and Emergent Catalytic Properties of Dimeric Unnatural Amino Acid Derivatives: Aldol and Conjugate Additions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monomeric and dimeric organocatalysts behave differently: Aldol and Michael reactions catalysed by &#947;&#8208;dipeptides derived from densely substituted unnatural proline derivatives show different behaviours. In aldol reactions an additive scheme is observed, whereas in conjugate reactions the catalytic activity of these dipeptides constitutes an emergent property. Experimental, kinetic and computational studies are reported to understand these phenomena.







Abstract
Different densely substituted L&#8208; and D&#8208;proline esters were prepared by asymmetric (3+2) cycloaddition reactions catalyzed by conveniently selected EhuPhos chiral ligands. The &#947;&#8208;nitro&#8208;2&#8208;alkoxycarbonyl pyrrolidines thus obtained in either their endo or exo forms were functionalized and coupled to yield the corresponding &#947;&#8208;dipeptides. The catalytic properties of these latter dimers were examined using aldol and conjugate additions as case studies. When aldol reactions were analyzed, an additive behavior in terms of stereocontrol was observed on going from the monomers to the dimers. In contrast, in the case of the conjugate additions between ketones and nitroalkenes, the monomers did not catalyze this reaction, whereas the different &#947;&#8208;dipeptides promoted the formation of the corresponding Michael adducts. Therefore, in this latter case emergent catalytic properties were observed for these novel &#947;&#8208;dipeptides based on unnatural proline derivatives. Under certain conditions stoichiometric amounts of ketone, acid and nitroalkene), formation of N&#8208;acyloxy&#8208;2&#8208;oxooctahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;indoles was observed.

         <title>Achieving Enhanced Photochromic Properties of Diarylethene through Host&#8208;Guest Interaction in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the presence of CB[n] host, the photophysical and photochemical properties of diarylethene derivatives (DTEs) were significantly affected. With suitable CB[n], DTEs showed faster response rate, better fatigue resistance, and higher fluorescence quenching ratio, suggesting that high&#8208;performance photochromic system in aqueous solution can be constructed through CB[n]&#8208;based host&#8208;guest interactions.







Abstract
Diarylethene (DTE) has been widely used in fluorescence probes, molecular logic gates, optical data&#8208;storage devices owing to the excellent photochromic property, while constructing high&#8208;performance photochromic DTE in aqueous media remains a big challenge. Herein we present several host&#8208;guest systems formed between cucurbit[n]uril (CB[n], n=7, 8, 10) and two water&#8208;soluble DTE derivatives 1 and 2. It was found that host&#8208;guest interactions not only affect the photophysical properties of photochromic guests, but also make great differences on the photoreaction process. Different host&#8208;guest binding behaviors also lead to different effects on the photochromic properties of guests. In the presence of CB[n], both 1 and 2 showed enhanced emission and higher fluorescence quenching ratio at photostationary state. Besides, CB[10]&#8901;1 exhibited faster response rate in cyclization reaction and better photofatigue resistance than free 1 in aqueous solution, while the supramolecular assembly of (CB[8])n&#8901;(2)n showed slower response rate in both directions of the reversible photoreaction. Besides, the photofatigue resistance of 2 can be greatly improved through binding with CB[7]. Our results suggest that host&#8208;guest interactions could be an efficient way to improve photochromic properties of DTE in aqueous solution.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular machine: A family of loaded molecular winches were designed and synthesized as prototypes for mechanical studies at the single&#8208;molecule scale. The molecular winch structure derives from a molecular motor based on a ruthenium complex and is covalently linked to a series of molecular loads such as triptycene, fullerene and porphyrin fragments.

We report the synthesis of conceptually new prototypes of molecular winches with the ultimate aim to investigate the work performed by a single ruthenium&#8208;based molecular motor anchored on a surface by probing its ability to pull a load upon electrically&#8208;driven directional rotation. According to a technomimetic design, the motor was embedded in a winch structure, with a long flexible polyethylene glycol chain terminated by an azide hook to connect a variety of molecular loads. The structure of the motor was first derivatized by means of two sequential cross&#8208;coupling reactions involving a penta(4&#8208;halogenophenyl)cyclopentadienyl hydrotris(indazolyl)borate ruthenium(II) precursor and the resulting benzylamine derivative was next exploited as key intermediate in the divergent synthesis of a family of nanowinch prototypes. A one&#8208;pot method involving sequential peptide coupling and Cu&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition was developed to yield four loaded nanowinches, with load fragments encompassing triptycene, fullerene and porphyrin moieties.

         <title>Morphology Engineering of Fullerene (C60) Microstructures Featuring Surface Cracks with Enhanced Photoluminescence and Microscopic Recognition Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
All they&#8242;re cracked up to be: C60 microstructures featuring surface cracks were synthesized for the first time from a phenetole/propan&#8208;1&#8208;ol (NPA) solvents system, in which phenetole and NPA molecules participate in the formation of the fcc ends and hcp sidewalls of the C60 microstructures, respectively. The introduction of surface cracks into C60 crystals benefits the photoluminescence enhancement and the development of microscopic recognition of C60 crystals, demonstrating their potential applications from optoelectronics to biology.







Abstract
Surface cracks could improve the optical and photoelectronic properties of crystalline materials as they increase specific surface area, but the controlled self&#8208;assembly of fullerene (C60) molecules into micro&#8208;/nanostructures with surface cracks is still challenging. Herein, we report the morphology engineering of novel C60 microstructures bearing surface cracks for the first time, selecting phenetole and propan&#8208;1&#8208;ol (NPA) as good and poor solvents, respectively. Our systematic investigations reveal that phenetole molecules initially participate in the formation of the ends of the C60 microstructures, and then NPA molecules are involved in the gradual growth of the sidewalls of the microstructures. Therefore, the surface cracks of C60 microstructures can be finely regulated by adjusting the addition of NPA and the crystallization time. Interestingly, the cracked C60 microstructures show superior photoluminescence properties relative to the smooth microstructures due to the increased specific surface area. In addition, C60 microstructures with wide cracks show preferential recognition of silica particles over C60 particles owing to electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged C60 microstructures and the positively charged silica microparticles. These C60 crystals with surface cracks have potential applications from optoelectronics to biology.

         <title>Transmetalation Reactions of Aromatic Dilithionickelole: Synthesis of Heterobimetallic Complexes Featuring Metalloles as Diene Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and efficient method to prepare Ni/M heterobimetallic complexes (M=Mg, Al, Sc, Lu, Pt) of the general formula (&#951;4&#8722;C4R4M)Ni(COD) (COD=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene) is realized through the transmetalation reactions of aromatic dilithionickelole. In these reactions, two electrons of the aromatic nickelole dianion transfer to the Ni atom, representing a novel reactivity compared with main&#8208;group metallole dianions. The bonding mode of these heterobimetallic complexes is studied by manifold experimental and theoretical analyses.







Abstract
The aromatic metallole dianions are important metallaaromatic compounds because of their various reactivities and extensive synthetic applications. Herein we report the reactions of dilithionickelole with MgCl2, EtAlCl2, Cp*ScCl2, Cp*LuCl2 and Pt(COD)Cl2 (COD=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene) affording a series of Ni/M heterobimetallic complexes of the general formula (&#951;4&#8722;C4R4M)Ni(COD), in which the metalloles act as diene ligands, as suggested by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray, NMR and theoretical analyses. In these reactions, two electrons of the nickelole dianion transferred to Ni, representing different reactivity compared with main&#8208;group metallole dianions.

Assisted self&#8208;assembly by using a preformed [Mn6O2(piv)10(4&#8208;Me&#8208;py)2(pivH)2] (1) (pivH=pivalic acid) cluster leads to 3 different outcomes of the reaction with Ln(NO3)3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xH2O (Ln=Pr&#8722;Ho and Y): Mn7Ln3 and in some cases the inverse butterfly Mn2Ln2 for Ln=Pr&#8722;Eu, Mn5Ln4 for Ln=Tb&#8208;Ho and in the special case of Gd all three possibilities can form. Whilst the magnetic properties for the Mn5Ln4 systems show the expected known SMM properties, for Mn7Ln3 two new examples of Nd&#8208; and Sm&#8208;containing SMMs have been discovered.







Abstract
In an assisted self&#8208;assembly approach starting from the [Mn6O2(piv)10(4&#8208;Me&#8208;py)2(pivH)2] cluster a family of Mn&#8722;Ln compounds (Ln=Pr&#8722;Yb) was synthesised. The reaction of [Mn6O2(piv)10(4&#8208;Me&#8208;py)2(pivH)2] (1) with N&#8208;methyldiethanolamine (mdeaH2) and Ln(NO3)3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6H2O in MeCN generally yields two main structure types: for Ln=Tb&#8722;Yb a previously reported Mn5Ln4 motif is obtained, whereas for Ln=Pr&#8722;Eu a series of Mn7Ln3 clusters is obtained. Within this series the GdIII analogue represents a special case because it shows both structural types as well as a third Mn2Ln2 inverse butterfly motif. Variation in reaction conditions allows access to different structure types across the whole series. This prompts further studies into the reaction mechanism of this cluster assisted self&#8208;assembly approach. For the Mn7Ln3 analogues reported here variable&#8208;temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements suggest that antiferromagnetic interactions between the spin carriers are dominant. Compounds incorporating Ln=NdIII(2), SmIII(3) and GdIII (5) display SMM behaviour. The slow relaxation of the magnetisation for these compounds was confirmed by ac measurements above 1.8&#8197;K.

         <title>Origin of the Rate Acceleration in the C&#8722;C Reductive Elimination from Pt(IV)&#8208;complex in a [Ga4L6]12&#8722; Supramolecular Metallocage</title>

         <dc:description>
The influence of microsolvation and encapsulation on the acceleration of the C&#8722;C reductive elimination from a Pt(IV) complex inside the [Ga4L6]12&#8722; metallocage is evaluated. The comparison with a related encapsulated Au(III) reaction shows that whereas the Gibbs energy barrier reduction is similar their contribution it is not.







Abstract
The reductive elimination on [(Me3P)2Pt(MeOH)(CH3)3]+, 2P, complex performed in MeOH solution and inside a [Ga4L6]12&#8722; metallocage are computationally analysed by mean of QM and MD simulations and compared with the mechanism of gold parent systems previously reported [Et3PAu(MeOH)(CH3)2]+, 2Au. The comparative analysis between the encapsulated Au(III) and Pt(IV)&#8208;counterparts shows that there are no additional solvent MeOH molecules inside the cavity of the metallocage for both systems. The Gibbs energy barriers for the 2P reductive elimination calculated at DFT level are in good agreement with the experimental values for both environments. The effect of microsolvation and encapsulation on the rate acceleration are evaluated and shows that the latter is far more relevant, conversely to 2Au. Energy decomposition analysis indicates that the encapsulation is the main responsible for most of the energy barrier reduction. Microsolvation and encapsulation effects are not equally contributing for both metal systems and consequently, the reasons of the rate acceleration are not the same for both metallic systems despite the similarity between them.

         <title>Diphenylalanine Motif Drives Self&#8208;Assembling in Hybrid PNA&#8208;Peptide Conjugates</title>

Forces triggering self&#8208;assembly. Conjugates of the PNA gc to the dipeptide FF assemble in water, producing fluorescent materials. Watson&#8208;Crick hydrogen bonds between complementary nucleobases and aromatic interactions between amino acids could stabilize the aggregate. The latter mainly drive the aggregation process.







Abstract
Peptides and nucleic acids can self&#8208;assemble to give supramolecular structures that find application in different fields, ranging from the delivery of drugs to the obtainment of materials endowed with optical properties. Forces that stabilize the &#8220;suprastructures&#8221; typically are hydrogen bonds or aromatic interactions; in case of nucleic acids, Watson&#8208;Crick pairing drives self&#8208;assembly while, in case of peptides, backbone hydrogen bonds and interactions between aromatic side chains trigger the formation of structures, such as nanotubes or ribbons. Molecules containing both aromatic peptides and nucleic acids could in principle exploit different forces to self&#8208;assemble. In this work we meant to investigate the self&#8208;assembly of mixed systems, with the aim to understand which forces play a major role and determine formation/structure of aggregates. We therefore synthesized conjugates of the peptide FF to the peptide nucleic acid dimer &#8220;gc&#8221; and characterized their aggregates by different spectroscopic techniques, including NMR, CD and fluorescence.

         <title>Potassium Ion Conductivity in the Cubic Labyrinth of a Piezoelectric, Antiferromagnetic Oxoferrate(III) Tellurate(VI)</title>

K(nockout) response: K12+6xFe6Te4&#8722;xO27 was synthesized under hydroflux conditions. The acentric cubic crystal structure comprises two non&#8208;interpenetrating chiral oxometalate networks formed by edge&#8208; or corner&#8208;sharing [TeVIO6] and [FeIIIO5] polyhedra. The potassium ions are mobile in the labyrinth between the networks. The magnetic moments of the iron cations are pairwise antiparallel, and the compound exhibits a strong piezoelectric response.







Abstract
Orange&#8208;colored crystals of the oxoferrate tellurate K12+6xFe6Te4&#8722;xO27 [x=0.222(4)] were synthesized in a potassium hydroxide hydroflux with a molar water&#8211;base ratio n(H2O)/n(KOH) of 1.5 starting from Fe(NO3)3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;9H2O, TeO2 and H2O2 at about 200&#8201;&#176;C. By using (NH4)2TeO4 instead of TeO2, a fine powder consisting of microcrystalline spheres of K12+6xFe6Te4&#8722;xO27 was obtained. K12+6xFe6Te4&#8722;xO27 crystallizes in the acentric cubic space group I
3d. [FeIIIO5] pyramids share their apical atoms in [Fe2O9] groups and two of their edges with [TeVIO6] octahedra to form an open framework that consists of two loosely connected, but not interpenetrating, chiral networks. The flexibility of the hinged oxometalate network manifests in a piezoelectric response similar to that of LiNbO3.The potassium cations are mobile in channels that run along the &lt;111&gt; directions and cross in cavities acting as nodes. The ion conductivity of cold&#8208;pressed pellets of ball&#8208;milled K12+6xFe6Te4&#8722;xO27 is 2.3&#215;10&#8722;4 S&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature. Magnetization measurements and neutron diffraction indicate antiferromagnetic coupling in the [Fe2O9] groups.

Getting into position: The position of hydrogen&#8208;bonding amide groups affects the properties of a series of luminescent N&#8208;annulated perylenes that self&#8208;assemble into nanostructured liquid&#8208;crystalline columnar phases. The liquid crystals with the amide linkers close to the central perylene core exhibit liquid&#8208;crystalline phases with a wider temperature range. In contrast, perylenes with ester groups, instead of amides, close to the central core exhibit vapochromism upon exposure to organic solvents.







Abstract
We report the liquid&#8208;crystalline (LC) and luminescent properties of a series of N&#8208;annulated perylenes (1&#8211;4) in whose molecular structures amide and ester groups alternate. We found that the LC properties of these compounds not only depend on the number of hydrogen&#8208;bonding units, but also on the relative position of the amide linkers in the molecule. The absence of amide groups in compound 1 leads to no LC properties, whereas four amide groups induce the formation of a wide temperature range columnar hexagonal phase in compound 4. Remarkably, compound 3, with two amide groups in the inner part of the structure, stabilizes the columnar LC phases better than its structural isomer 2, with the amide groups in the outer part of the molecule. Similarly, we found that only compounds 1 and 2, which have no hydrogen bonding units in the inner part of the molecule, exhibit luminescence vapochromism upon exposure to organic solvent vapors.

         <title>Aminotroponiminates: Impact of the NO2 Functional Group on Coordination, Isomerisation, and Backbone Substitution</title>

Unforeseen aspects of ATI chemistry: The impact of a nitro substituent in the backbone of the aminotroponiminate (ATI) ligand on the coordination chemistry and reactivity of alkali metal (Li&#8722;K) complexes has been investigated. This includes the first examples of i) an isolable free ATI anion, ii) E/Z imine isomerisations of ATI species and iii) N,N&#8208;coordinated silver ATIs.







Abstract
Aminotroponiminate (ATI) ligands are a versatile class of redox&#8208;active and potentially cooperative ligands with a rich coordination chemistry that have consequently found a wide range of applications in synthesis and catalysis. While backbone substitution of these ligands has been investigated in some detail, the impact of electron&#8208;withdrawing groups on the coordination chemistry and reactivity of ATIs has been little investigated. We report here Li, Na, and K salts of an ATI ligand with a nitro&#8208;substituent in the backbone. It is demonstrated that the NO2 group actively contributes to the coordination chemistry of these complexes, effectively competing with the N,N&#8208;binding pocket as a coordination site. This results in an unprecedented E/Z isomerisation of an ATI imino group and culminates in the isolation of the first &#8220;naked&#8221; (i.&#8201;e., without directional bonding to a metal atom) ATI anion. Reactions of sodium ATIs with silver(I) and tritylium salts gave the first N,N&#8208;coordinated silver ATI complexes and unprecedented backbone substitution reactions. Analytical techniques applied in this work include multinuclear (VT&#8208;)NMR spectroscopy, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, and DFT calculations.

         <title>C&#8722;C Cross&#8208;Couplings from a Cyclometalated Au(III) C
N Complex: Mechanistic Insights and Synthetic Developments</title>

The mechanism of C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp) coupling templated by the Au(III) cyclometalated complex [Au(CCH2N)Cl2] has been investigated. By tuning the reaction conditions and monitoring its progress by NMR, a number of intermediate species involved in the reductive elimination process could be isolated and characterised by different spectroscopic and analytical methods, including XRD, as well as by DFT studies.







Abstract
In recent years, the reactivity of gold complexes was shown to extend well beyond &#960;&#8208;activation and to hold promises to achieve selective cross&#8208;couplings in several C&#8722;C and C&#8722;E (E=heteroatom) bond forming reactions. Here, with the aim of exploiting new organometallic species for cross&#8208;coupling reactions, we report on the Au(III)&#8208;mediated C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp) occurring upon reaction of the cyclometalated complex [Au(CCH2N)Cl2] (1, CCH2N=2&#8208;benzylpyridine) with AgPhCC. The reaction progress has been monitored by NMR spectroscopy, demonstrating the involvement of a number of key intermediates, whose structures have been unambiguously ascertained through 1D and 2D NMR analyses (1H, 13C, 1H&#8208;1H COSY, 1H&#8208;13C HSQC and 1H&#8208;13C HMBC) as well as by HR&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS and X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. Furthermore, crystallographic studies have serendipitously resulted in the authentication of zwitterionic Au(I) complexes as side&#8208;products arising from cyclization of the coupling product in the coordination sphere of gold. The experimental work has been paralleled and complemented by DFT calculations of the reaction profiles, providing valuable insight into the structure and energetics of the key intermediates and transition states, as well as on the coordination sphere of gold along the whole process. Of note, the broader scope of the cross&#8208;coupling at the Au(III) CCH2N centre has also been demonstrated studying the reaction of 1 with C(sp2)&#8208;based nucleophiles, namely vinyl and heteroaryl tin and zinc reagents. These reactions stand as rare examples of C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp2) cross&#8208;couplings at Au(III).

Charge Transfer and Separation. Occurrence of charge transfer and separation processes in newly synthesized porphyrin&#8208;TCBD&#8208;Donor multi&#8208;modular donor&#8208;acceptor systems is reported. The significance of the nature of porphyrins and second electron donor in governing the charge transfer events in these closely positioned conjugates is borne out from the present study.







Abstract
Using a combination of cycloaddition&#8208;retroelectrocyclization reaction, free&#8208;base and zinc porphyrins (H2P and ZnP) are decorated at their &#946;&#8208;pyrrole positions with strong charge transfer complexes, viz., tetracyanobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene (TCBD)&#8208;phenothiazine (3 and 4) or TCBD&#8208;aniline (7 and 8), novel class of push&#8208;pull systems. The physico&#8208;chemical properties of these compounds (MP&#8208;Donor and MP&#8208;TCBD&#8208;Donor) have been investigated using a range of electrochemical, spectroelectrochemical, DFT as well as steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic techniques. Ground&#8208;state charge transfer interactions between the porphyrin and the electron&#8208;withdrawing TCBD directly attached to the porphyrin &#960;&#8208;system extended the absorption features well into the near&#8208;infrared region. To visualize the photo&#8208;events, energy level diagrams with the help of free&#8208;energy calculations have been established. Switching the role of porphyrin from the initial electron acceptor to electron donor was possible to envision. Occurrence of photoinduced charge separation has been established by complementary transient absorption spectral studies followed by global and target data analyses. Better charge stabilization in H2P derived over ZnP derived conjugates, and in phenothiazine derived over aniline derived conjugates has been possible to establish. These findings highlight the importance of the nature of porphyrins and second electron donor in governing the ground and excited state charge transfer events in closely positioned donor&#8208;acceptor conjugates.

         <title>Oxidatively Induced Selective Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bond Formation From Isolated Rhodium(III) Complexes</title>

         <dc:description>
In the oxidation&#8208;induced reaction based on octahedral RhIII complexes synthesized from Rh2(TFA)4 with 2&#8208;arylpyridines, different regioselective C&#8722;C bond formations were achieved by changing the steric and electronic properties of the aryl ligands. This study provides feasible selective activation of C&#8722;H bonds by the oxidation induction of RhIII complexes, which may be useful for the design of new rhodium metal catalysts and development of efficient and highly selective reactions.







Abstract
This work focuses on oxidatively induced regioselective intramolecular C&#8722;C bond formations based on the RhIII complexes synthesized from dirhodium(II) trifluoroacetate with 2&#8208;arylpyridines. With the selection of electron&#8208;donating groups on the arene rings of 2&#8208;arylpyridines, the unusual meta&#8208;ortho C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming was favored, which led to the formation of meta&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;arylpyridine homocoupling dimers. On the contrary, the electron&#8208;withdrawing groups have tendency to occur conventional ortho&#8208;ortho bond&#8208;forming, resulting in the formation of new RhIII complexes possessing the intriguing RhIII(TFA)3 fragment. Preliminary mechanistic experiments suggest that the sequential oxidation of RhIII occurred in the reaction.

Controlled thermolysis of HKUST&#8208;1 produces the partial removal of ligands, the generation of structural defects and additional porosity in a controlled way. The resulting defective materials denoted according to the literature as quasi&#8208;MOFs, were subsequently employed as catalyst for one pot imine synthesis by cross coupling of alcohols with amines.







Abstract
Copper&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (Cu3(BTC)2(H2O)3]n&#8901;nH2OMeOH (HKUST&#8208;1) has been subjected to thermolysis under air atmosphere at different temperatures ranging from 100 to 300&#8201;&#176;C. This treatment produces the partial removal of ligands, the generation of structural defects and additional porosity in a controlled way. The resulting defective materials denoted according to the literature as quasi&#8208;MOFs, were subsequently employed as heterogeneous catalysts in the one pot synthesis of N&#8208;benzylideneaniline from aniline and benzyl alcohol in open air as terminal oxidant at 70&#8201;&#176;C under base&#8208; and dehydrating agent&#8208;free conditions. The Q&#8208;HKUST catalysts calcined at 240&#8201;&#176;C (QH&#8208;240) was the most efficient in the series, promoting imine synthesis. Data from Knoevenagel condensation of malononitrile shows that in QH&#8208;240 the distances of Cu ions in HKUST&#8208;1 cavities are preserved, increasing the Knoevenagel activity, but a strong rearrangement takes place at 300&#8201;&#176;C or above. The unsaturated copper active sites with simultaneous presence of micro&#8208; and mesopores in QH&#8208;240 are responsible for this excellent catalytic performance. The effective parameters on catalytic activity of QH&#8208;240 including deligandation temperature, the amount of catalyst, the ratio of reactants, and reaction temperature as well as the stability and recyclability of the catalyst were also investigated. The possible mechanism used by QH&#8208;240 follows alcohol aerobic oxidation and subsequent anaerobic condensation of aldehyde intermediate with aniline.

         <title>Titanium Vacancies in TiO2 Nanofibers Enable Highly Efficient Photodriven Seawater Splitting</title>

         <dc:description>
Erosion of corrosion: TiO2 nanofibers with rich Ti vacancies have been designed by a facile controllable calcination approach. They exhibit efficient charge transfer and resistance to corrosion by seawater owing to a unidirectional electron trap and superior H+ adsorption; which contribute to excellent activity and long&#8208;time stability in photodriven seawater splitting. This study could provide a promising strategy for the design of efficient semiconductors in marine applications.







Abstract
Photodriven seawater splitting is considered to be one of the most promising techniques for sustainable hydrogen production. However, the high salinity of seawater would deactivate catalysts and consume the photogenerated carriers. Metal vacancies in metal oxide semiconductors are critical to directed electron transfer and high salinity resistance; they are thus desirable but remain a challenge. We demonstrate a facile controllable calcination approach to synthesize TiO2 nanofibers with rich Ti vacancies with excellent photo/electro performances and long&#8208;time stability in photodriven seawater splitting, including photocatalysis and photo&#8208;electrocatalysis. Experimental measurements and theoretical calculations reveal the formation of titanium vacancies, as well as unidirectional electron trap and superior H+ adsorption ability for efficient charge transfer and resistance to corrosion by seawater. Therefore, atomic&#8208;/nanoscale characteristics and mechanism have been proposed to clarify the generation of titanium vacancies and the corresponding interfacial electron transfer.

         <title>Effectiveness of the Oxygenation over Classical Protonolysis Reactions: A Case of Alkylzinc Complexes Incorporating an Aminoalcoholate Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 57, Page 14234-14239, October 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stepwise controlled oxygenation of a tert&#8208;butylzinc complex incorporating a pridinolum (prinol) ligand affords a dinuclear adduct of a (prinol)ZnOOR moiety with the parent tBuZn(prinol) complex and a novel dimer [tBuOOZn(prinol)]2 with terminal alkylperoxide groups. Strikingly, these seemingly simple zinc alkylperoxides and related zinc alkoxides are not accessible via the classical protonolysis route.







Abstract
Alkylzinc aminoalcoholates have emerged as powerful catalysts in organic synthesis and polymerization processes. Despite extensive research, difficulties in the rational design of these catalytic systems and in&#8208;depth understanding of their modes of action have hitherto been encountered. Most of the major obstacles stem largely from the relatively limited knowledge of the structure&#8208;activity relationship of zinc catalysts. In fact, the key active species are often generated in&#8197;situ via the protonolysis of the alkylzinc precursors, which precludes their isolation and detailed characterization. Herein, the effectiveness of the oxygenation over the classical protonolysis in the synthesis of zinc alkylperoxides stabilized by an aminoalcoholate ligand is demonstrated. The controlled oxygenation of a tert&#8208;butylzinc complex incorporating a pridinolum (prinol) ligand leads to well&#8208;defined a dinuclear adduct of a (prinol)ZnOOtBu moiety with the parent tBuZn(prinol) complex and a novel dimer [tBuOOZn(prinol)]2 with terminal alkylperoxide groups. The observed reaction outcomes strongly depend on the reaction conditions. Although sparse examples of heteroleptic adducts of the [RZn(L)]x[ROOZn(L)]y&#8208;type are known, the herein reported homoleptic [ROOZn(L)]x aggregate is unprecedented. Strikingly, comparative studies involving reactions between tBuZn(prinol) and tert&#8208;butylhydroperoxide or ethanol revealed that the respective seemingly simple zinc alkylperoxides, or zinc alkoxides, respectively, are not accessible via the classical alcoholysis. We believe that these game&#8208;changing results concerning multifaceted chemistry of organozinc aminoalcoholates should pave the way for more rational development of various Zn&#8208;based catalytic systems.

         <title>Platinum Indolylphosphine Fluorido and Polyfluorido Complexes: An Interplay between Cyclometallation, Fluoride Migration, and Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 57, Page 14287-14298, October 13, 2021. </description>

Fluorine on Skatole's scent. Tetramethylammoniumfluoride permits the twofold cyclometallation of 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;indolylphosphine ligands at platinum(ii) complexes. Hydrogen fluoride opens the cyclometallation yielding a unique Pt(ii) complex which exhibits hydrogen&#8208;bonding to the fluorido ligand in its outer coordination sphere. The fluorido complex reacts with an ynamide to give an exceptional metal bound oxazole derivative.







Abstract
The reaction of [PtCl2(COD)] (COD=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene) with diisopropyl&#8208;2&#8208;(3&#8208;methyl)indolylphosphine (iPr2P(C9H8N)) led to the formation of the platinum(ii) chlorido complexes, cis&#8208;[PtCl2{iPr2P(C9H8N)}2] (1) and trans&#8208;[PtCl2{iPr2P(C9H8N)}2] (2). The cis&#8208;complex 1 reacted with NEt3 yielding the complex cis&#8208;[PtCl{&#954;2&#8208;(P,N)&#8208;iPr2P(C9H7N)}{iPr2P(C9H8N)}] (3) bearing a cyclometalated &#954;2&#8208;(P,N)&#8208;phosphine ligand, while the isomer 2 with a trans&#8208;configuration did not show any reactivity towards NEt3. Treatment of 1 or 3 with (CH3)4NF (TMAF) resulted in the formation of the twofold cyclometalated complex cis&#8208;[Pt{&#954;2&#8208;(P,N)&#8208;iPr2P(C9H7N)}2] (4). The molecular structures of the complexes 1&#8211;4 were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The fluorido complex cis&#8208;[PtF{&#954;2&#8208;(P,N)&#8208;iPr2P(C9H7N)}{iPr2P(C9H8N)}]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(HF)4 (5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(HF)4) was formed when complex 4 was treated with different hydrogen fluoride sources. The Pt(ii) fluorido complex 5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(HF)4 exhibits intramolecular hydrogen bonding in its outer coordination sphere between the fluorido ligand and the NH group of the 3&#8208;methylindolyl moiety. In contrast to its chlorido analogue 3, complex 5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(HF)4 reacted with CO or the ynamide 1&#8208;(2&#8208;phenylethynyl)&#8208;2&#8208;pyrrolidinone to yield the complexes trans&#8208;[Pt(CO){&#954;2&#8208;(P,C)&#8208;iPr2P(C9H7NCO)}{iPr2P(C9H8N)}][F(HF)4] (7) and a complex, which we suggest to be cis&#8208;[Pt{C=C(Ph)OCN(C3H6)}{&#954;2&#8208;(P,N)&#8208;iPr2P(C9H7N)}{iPr2P(C9H8N)}][F(HF)4] (9), respectively. The structure of 9 was assigned on the basis of DFT calculations as well as NMR and IR data. Hydrogen bonding of HF and NH to fluoride was proven to be crucial for the existence of 7 and 9.

     alt="Platinum Indolylphosphine Fluorido and Polyfluorido Complexes: An Interplay between Cyclometallation, Fluoride Migration, and Hydrogen Bonding"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fluorine on Skatole's scent&lt;/b&gt;. Tetramethylammoniumfluoride permits the twofold cyclometallation of 3-methyl-2-indolylphosphine ligands at platinum(&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;ii&lt;/span&gt;) complexes. Hydrogen fluoride opens the cyclometallation yielding a unique Pt(&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;ii&lt;/span&gt;) complex which exhibits hydrogen-bonding to the fluorido ligand in its outer coordination sphere. The fluorido complex reacts with an ynamide to give an exceptional metal bound oxazole derivative.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reaction of [PtCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(COD)] (COD=1,5-cyclooctadiene) with diisopropyl-2-(3-methyl)indolylphosphine (&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P(C&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;N)) led to the formation of the platinum(&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;ii&lt;/span&gt;) chlorido complexes, &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-[PtCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P(C&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;N)}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-[PtCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P(C&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;N)}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;).

The structure of &lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt; was assigned on the basis of DFT calculations as well as NMR and IR data. Hydrogen bonding of HF and NH to fluoride was proven to be crucial for the existence of &lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Contorted Heteroannulated Tetraareno[a,d,j,m]coronenes</title>

Tuning tetraarenocoronenes: Cata&#8208;condensed heteroannulated tetraarenocoronenes with C2h symmetry have been obtained from three doubly brominated diarenoperylenes. X&#8208;ray diffraction showed that the coronenes mostly adopt S&#8208;shaped contorted &#960;&#8208;planes. The large variety of fused rings in the coronenes&#8242; core allows good control of their photophysical properties and thus their potential use in organic electronics applications.







Abstract
Fused polycyclic aromatic compounds are interesting materials for organic electronics applications. To fine&#8208;tune photophysical or electrochemical properties, either various substituents can be attached or heteroatoms (such as N or S) can be incorporated into the fused aromatic backbone. Coronenes and heterocoronenes are promising compounds in this respect. Up until now, the possibilities for varying the attached fused heteroaromatics at the coronene core were quite limited, and realizing both electron&#8208;withdrawing and &#8208;donating rings at the same time was very difficult. Here, a series of pyridine, anisole and thiophene annulated tetraareno[a,d,j,m]coronenes has been synthesized by a facile two&#8208;step route that is a combination of Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling and a following cyclization step, starting from three different diarenoperylene dibromides. The contorted molecular &#960;&#8208;planes of the obtained cata&#8208;condensed tetraarenocoronenes were analyzed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography, and the photophysical and electrochemical properties were systematically investigated by UV/Vis spectroscopy and cyclovoltammetry.

Maybe diamonds aren&#8242;t forever: Cubic diamond (Fd
m) silicon has been the material driver for electronics from the onset. In that structure, however, it absorbs and emits light inefficiently and offers no compositional tunability of properties. Both issues have been addressed by creating bulk GeSi solid solutions under pressure that are recovered in a different cubic structure (la
). This structure now transforms to a tunable hexagonal one that may not suffer from silicon's deficiencies.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;anvil and laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil methods have been used to subject Ge and Si mixtures to pressures and temperatures of between 12 and 17&#8197;GPa and 1500&#8211;1800&#8197;K, respectively. Synchrotron angle dispersive X&#8208;ray diffraction, precession electron diffraction and chemical analysis using electron microscopy, reveal recovery at ambient pressure of hexagonal Ge&#8722;Si solid solutions (P63/mmc). Taken together, the multi&#8208;anvil and diamond anvil results reveal that hexagonal solid solutions can be prepared for all Ge&#8722;Si compositions. This hexagonal class of solid solutions constitutes a significant expansion of the bulk Ge&#8722;Si solid solution family, and is of interest for optoelectronic applications.

Repair and reuse: The recovery of waste LiCoO2 material is realized by the combination of industrial machinery process and small&#8208;scale equipment repair technology. The results showed that the crystal structure of the material was repaired with the excellent electrochemical performance.







Abstract
A large number of lithium batteries have been retiring from the market of energy storage. Thus, recycling of the used electrode materials is becoming urgent. In this study, an industrial machinery processing was used to recover the crystal structure of the waste LiCoO2 materials with the combination of small&#8208;scale equipment repair technology. The results show that the crystal parameters of the repaired LiCoO2 material become small, the unit cell volume is reduced, and the crystal structure tends to be stable. The Co&#8722;O bond length of 1.9134&#8197;nm, O&#8722;Co&#8722;O bond angle of 94.72&#176;, the (003) interplanar spacing of 0.467&#8197;nm indicate the excellent recovery level of the repaired LiCoO2. In addition, the electrochemical performance of the repaired LiCoO2 material is greatly improved, compared with the waste material. The capacity of the repaired electrode material can be maintained at 120&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 100 cycles at the current density of 0.2C. The promising rate performance of the repaired electrode material demonstrates the stable structure. This research work provides a large&#8208;scale method for the direct recovery of LiCoO2 with the reduction of unnecessary energy and reagent consumption, which will be beneficial to the environmental protection.

In addition, the electrochemical performance of the repaired LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; material is greatly improved, compared with the waste material. The capacity of the repaired electrode material can be maintained at 120&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 100 cycles at the current density of 0.2C. The promising rate performance of the repaired electrode material demonstrates the stable structure. This research work provides a large-scale method for the direct recovery of LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with the reduction of unnecessary energy and reagent consumption, which will be beneficial to the environmental protection.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Small&#8208;Molecule Diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;Based Dye for in&#8197;vivo NIR&#8208;IIa Fluorescence Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 57, Page 14240-14249, October 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the small&#8208;molecule DPP&#8208;based fluorophore T25 with NIR&#8208;II and NIR&#8208;IIa emission, T25@F127 were selected for fluorescence angiography and cerebral vascular microscopic imaging of mice with nearly 800&#8197;&#956;m penetrating depth and excellent signal&#8208;background ratio of 4.07 and 2.26 (at 250 and 400&#8197;&#956;m), respectively. Furthermore, T25@cRGD with tumor targeting ability could image tiny metastatic tumor on intestine with a small size of 0.3&#8197;mm&#215;1.0&#8197;mm.







Abstract
Organic small&#8208;molecule fluorophores with near&#8208;infrared IIa (NIR&#8208;IIa) emission have great potential in pre&#8208;clinical detection and inoperative imaging due to the high&#8208;spatial resolution and deep penetration. However, developments of the NIR&#8208;IIa fluorophores are still facing considerable challenges. In this work, a series of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)&#8208;based fluorophores were designed and synthesized. Subsequently, nanomaterial T25@F127 with significant NIR&#8208;IIa emission properties was rationally prepared by encapsulating DPP&#8208;based fluorophore T25, and was selected for fluorescence angiography and cerebral vascular microscopic imaging with nearly 800&#8197;&#956;m penetrating depth and excellent signal&#8208;background ratio of 4.07 and 2.26 (at 250 and 400&#8197;&#956;m), respectively. Furthermore, the nanomaterial T25@cRGD with tumor targeting ability can image tiny metastatic tumor on intestine with a small size of 0.3&#8197;mm&#215;1.0&#8197;mm and high&#8208;spatial resolution (SBR=3.84). This study demonstrates that the nanomaterials which encapsulated T25 behave as excellent NIR&#8208;IIa fluorescence imaging agents and have a great potential for in&#8197;vivo biological application.

         <title>Synthesis of Oligonucleotides Containing Trans Mitomycin C DNA Adducts at N6 of Adenine and N2 of Guanine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 57, Page 14263-14272, October 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A route to access modified oligonucleotides containing trans dA monoadducts produced from the reaction between mitomycin C and DNA is presented. Parent oligonucleotides containing a trans dG monoadduct and a trans dG&#8208;MC&#8208;dG ICL were also produced. The stability and spectral properties of all substrates were compared and virtual models were created to explore the conformational space and structural features of these MC&#8208;DNA complexes.







Abstract
Mitomycin C, (MC), an antitumor drug, is a DNA alkylating agent currently used in the clinics. Inert in its native form, MC is reduced to reactive mitosenes, which undergo nucleophilic attack by guanine or adenine bases in DNA to form monoadducts as well as interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). Although ICLs are considered the most cytotoxic lesions, the role of each individual adduct in the drug's cytotoxicity is still not fully understood. Synthetic routes have been developed to access modified oligonucleotides containing dG MC&#8208;monoadducts and dG&#8208;MC&#8208;dG ICL at a single position of their base sequences to investigate the biological effects of these adducts. However, until now, oligonucleotides containing monoadducts formed by MC at the adenine base had not been available, thus preventing the examination of the role played by these lesions in the toxicity of MC. Here, we present a route to access these substrates. Structural proof of the adducted oligonucleotides were provided by enzymatic digestion to nucleosides and high&#8208;resolution mass spectral analysis. Additionally, parent oligonucleotides containing a dG monoadduct and a dG&#8208;MC&#8208;dG ICL were also produced. The stability and physical properties of all substrates were compared via CD spectroscopy and UV melting temperature studies. Finally, virtual models were created to explore the conformational space and structural features of these MC&#8208;DNA complexes.

         <title>Crystal Structures of AlCr2 and MoSi2: Same Structure Type vs. Different Bonding Pattern</title>

Hidden crystals: With a modified synthesis approach and micro&#8208;fabrication technique, it was possible to isolate micrometer&#8208;sized single crystals of AlCr2 from a largely polycrystalline sample. Chemical bond analysis shows close relation to elements, in contrast to a quite localized bonding pattern in the prototype, MoSi2.







Abstract
In a joint effort utilizing modified sample preparation, microscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction and micro&#8208;fabrication, it became possible to prepare single crystals of the &#8220;hidden&#8221; phase AlCr2. High&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis is described in detail for two crystals with the similar overall composition, but different degree of disorder, which seems to be the main cause for the differing unit cell parameters. Chemical bonding analysis of AlCr2 in comparison to prototypical MoSi2 shows pronounced differences reflecting the interchange of main group element vs. transition metal as majority component.

         <dc:description>
Polymerization techniques such as suspension, mini&#8208;emulsion, dispersion, and precipitation polymerization produce LC polymer particles of various sizes, LC phases, and molecular alignments, and hence should be used in accordance with the targeted properties. The particles have found applications as rotors, absorbents, cell scaffolds, reflectors, actuators, and drug carriers. Although usually &#8220;homogeneous&#8221;, LC polymer particles with distinctive chemical domains or complex physical structures could bring more functionality. For more details on the techniques, results, and possible improvements, see the Minireview by J.&#8197;P.&#8197;A. Heuts, A.&#8197;P.&#8197;H.&#8197;J. Schenning et al. on page 14168&#8197;ff.

For more details on the techniques, results, and possible improvements, see the Minireview by J.&#8197;P.&#8197;A. Heuts, A.&#8197;P.&#8197;H.&#8197;J.

There is a pressing engineering need to produce hexagonal SiGe, that is untemplated, to be able to develop optoelectronic devices with hex&#8208;SiGe and Si integrated on the same chip. We have contributed the timely, broad&#8208;interest advance of producing a bulk hexagonal SiGe landscape and explain how and under what conditions each Si&#8211;Ge composition becomes hexagonal. Moreover, the ability to synthesize different hexagonal polytypes affords further tailoring of optoelectronic properties. More information can be found in the Full Paper by G. Serghiou et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102595).

The quite &#8216;hidden&#8217; compound AlCr2 was isolated for the first time as micro&#8208;fabricated single crystals. Crystal structure and chemical bonding analyses reveal largely different interactions as a consequence of the inverted coloring pattern with respect to prototypical MoSi2.

Rich Ti vacancies in TiO2 nanofibers are presented in the Full Paper by X.&#8208;Y. Yang and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101817). The unidirectional electron trap and directional H+ adsorption ability of Ti vacancies enable efficient charge transfer and resistance to the corrosion of seawater. They thus contribute excellent activity and long&#8208;time stability to photodriven seawater splitting, opening a door to marine applications of semiconductors.

Getting things in order: Liquid crystal (LC) polymer particles have a unique anisotropic supramolecular order that distinguishes them from conventional polymer particles. This review focuses on the preparation of LC polymer particles by classical polymerization techniques, including suspension, mini&#8208;emulsion, dispersion and precipitation polymerization. The particle size, LC phases, alignment, properties and applications are also presented.







Abstract
Liquid&#8208;crystalline polymer particles prepared by classical polymerization techniques are receiving increased attention as promising candidates for use in a variety of applications including micro&#8208;actuators, structurally colored objects, and absorbents. These particles have anisotropic molecular order and liquid&#8208;crystalline phases that distinguish them from conventional polymer particles. In this minireview, the preparation of liquid&#8208;crystalline polymer particles from classical suspension, (mini&#8208;)emulsion, dispersion, and precipitation polymerization reactions are discussed. The particle sizes, molecular orientations, and liquid&#8208;crystalline phases produced by each technique are summarized and compared. We conclude with a discussion of the challenges and prospects of the preparation of liquid&#8208;crystalline polymer particles by classical polymerization techniques.

         <title>Application of Multinuclear MAS NMR for the in&#8197;situ Monitoring of Hydrothermal Synthesis of Zeolites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 57, Page 14143-14167, October 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potential of in&#8197;situ multinuclear MAS NMR spectroscopy for monitoring hydrothermal synthesis of zeolites is demonstrated in the Review. The technique enables the detection of intermediate species stable only under hydrothermal conditions, provides information on the kinetics of synthesis and gives insight into the mechanism of gel formation, gel aging, crystal nucleation and growth.







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The potential of in&#8197;situ multinuclear MAS NMR spectroscopy&lt;/b&gt; for monitoring hydrothermal synthesis of zeolites is demonstrated in the Review. The technique enables the detection of intermediate species stable only under hydrothermal conditions, provides information on the kinetics of synthesis and gives insight into the mechanism of gel formation, gel aging, crystal nucleation and growth.

         <title>Hydrogenation of Secondary Amides using Phosphane Oxide and Frustrated Lewis Pair Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 57, Page 14179-14183, October 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydrogenation of secondary carboxylic acid amides by combined phosphane oxide and frustrated Lewis pair catalysis is described. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions and displays excellent functional group tolerance. Kinetic and quantum&#8208;chemical experiments support the autoinduced catalytic cycle with chloride as active Lewis base for the hydrogen activation.







Abstract
The metal&#8208;free catalytic hydrogenation of secondary carboxylic acid amides is developed. The reduction is realized by two new catalytic reactions. First, the amide is converted into the imidoyl chloride by triphosgene (CO(OCCl3)2) using novel phosphorus(V) catalysts. Second, the in&#8197;situ generated imidoyl chlorides are hydrogenated in high yields by an FLP&#8208;catalyst. Mechanistic and quantum mechanical calculations support an autoinduced catalytic cycle for the hydrogenation with chloride acting as unusual Lewis base for FLP&#8208;mediated H2&#8208;activation.

         <title>A Self&#8208;immolative Molecular Beacon for Amplified Nucleic Acid Detection**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 57, Page 14189-14194, October 13, 2021. </description>

The target as catalyst: A new category of nucleic acid&#8208;templated reaction is introduced. Binding of a self&#8208;immolative molecular beacon (iMB) to a DNA/RNA target can trigger a photocatalyzed cleavage reaction. The products have lower target affinity than the iMB before the reaction. This enables the target to act as a catalyst providing chemical amplification of signals. The unimolecular iMB probe allowed detection of 5&#8197;pm RNA within 100&#8197;min.







Abstract
Fluorogenic hybridization probes allow the detection of RNA and DNA sequences in homogeneous solution. Typically, one target molecule activates the fluorescence of a single probe molecule. This limits the sensitivity of nucleic acid detection. Herein, we report a self&#8208;immolative molecular beacon (iMB) that escapes the one&#8208;target/one&#8208;probe paradigm. The iMB probe includes a photoreductively cleavable N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;picolinium (NAP) linkage within the loop region. A fluorophore at the 5&#8217;&#8208;end serves, on the one hand, as a reporter group and, on the other hand, as a photosensitizer of a NAP&#8208;linker cleavage reaction. In the absence of target, the iMB adopts a hairpin shape. Quencher groups prevent photo&#8208;induced cleavage. The iMB opens upon hybridization with a target, and both fluorescent emission as well as photo&#8208;reductive cleavage of the NAP linker can occur. In contrast to previous chemical amplification reactions, iMBs are unimolecular probes that undergo cleavage leading to products that have lower target affinity than the probes before reaction. Aided by catalysis, the method allowed the detection of 5&#8197;pm RNA target within 100&#8197;min.

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure Synthesis of Sc5P12N23O3 and Ti5P12N24O2 by Activation of the Binary Nitrides ScN and TiN with NH4F</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 57, Page 14184-14188, October 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxonitridophosphates Sc5P12N23O3 and Ti5P12N24O2 have been prepared by high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature reactions from the refractory nitrides ScN and TiN, respectively. These reactions were enabled by the addition of NH4F as a mineralizing agent. The crystal structures were elucidated by a combination of SCXRD, BVS calculations and magnetic measurements for Ti5P12N24O2 revealing two distinct crystallographic sites occupied by either Ti3+ or Ti4+, respectively.







Abstract
Multinary transition metal nitrides and oxonitrides are a versatile and intriguing class of compounds. However, they have been investigated far less than pure oxides. The compounds Sc5P12N23O3 and Ti5P12N24O2 have now been synthesized from the binary nitrides ScN and TiN, respectively, by following a high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature approach at 8&#8197;GPa and 1400&#8201;&#176;C. NH4F acts as a mineralizing agent that supports product formation and crystallization. The starting materials ScN and TiN are seemingly an uncommon choice because of their chemical inertness but, nevertheless, react under these conditions. Sc5P12N23O3 and Ti5P12N24O2 crystallize isotypically with Ti5B12O26, consisting of solely vertex&#8208;sharing P(O/N)4 tetrahedra forming two independent interpenetrating diamond&#8208;like nets that host TM(O/N)6 (TM=Sc, Ti) octahedra. Ti5P12N24O2 is a mixed&#8208;valence compound and shows ordering of Ti3+ and Ti4+ ions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A visible-light-driven and room temperature photo-Wolff-Kischner reaction of sulfur ylides and N-tosylhydrazones has been developed for the first time to provide modular access to alkene synthesis. The high functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope were demonstrated by more than 60 examples. Both E- and Z-olefinic stereochemistry in the products could be controlled with excellent stereoselectivity. A series of mechanistic studies support that the reaction should proceed through a radical-carbanion crossover pathway, specifically involving addition of photo-generated sulfur ylide radical cations to N-tosylhydrazones to form carbanions and subsequent Wolff-Kischner process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report a Pd&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective domino Heck carbonylation reaction of o &#8208;iodoacrylanilides with terminal alkynes and water as the nucleophiles, affording a diversity of &#946; &#8208;carbonylated 2&#8208;oxindole derivatives bearing a 3,3&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter, in high yields (55&#8208;99%) with good to excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee). The synthetic utilities of the protocol were demonstrated in the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of 2&#8208;oxindole&#8208;derived ynone 3aa and carboxylic acid 4a , as well as the facile synthesis of chiral 2&#8208;oxindoles with a pyrazole or isoxazole moiety.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Haloalkynylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal catalysis has revolutionized synthetic chemistry, leading to entirely new, very efficient transformations, which enable access to complex functionalized molecules. One such new transformation method is the haloalkynylation reaction, in which both a halogen atom and an alkynyl unit are transferred to an unsaturated carbon&#8211;carbon bond. This minireview summarizes the developments of metal&#8208;catalyzed haloalkynylation reactions since their beginning about a decade ago. So far, arynes, alkenes and alkynes have been used as unsaturated systems and the reactivities of these systems are summarized in individual chapters of the minireview. Especially, the last few years have witnessed a rapid development due to gold&#8208;catalyzed reactions. Here, we discuss how the choice of the catalytic system influences the regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity of the addition.</dc:description>

         <title>Jahn&#8211;Teller Effects in a Vanadate&#8208;Stabilized Manganese&#8208;Oxo Cubane Water Oxidation Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&lt;p&gt;Heuristic rules that allow identifying the preferred mixed&#8208;valence isomers and Jahn&amp;ndash;Teller axis arrangements in the&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;water oxidation catalyst [(Mn&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)(V&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;)(OAc)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;n&#8208;&lt;/sup&gt; and its activated form [(Mn&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)(V&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;)(OAc)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)(OH)]&lt;sup&gt;n&#8208;&lt;/sup&gt; are&lt;br /&gt;derived. These rules are based on computing all combinatorially possible mixed&#8208;valence isomers and Jahn&amp;ndash;Teller axis&lt;br /&gt;arrangements of the Mn&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; atoms, and associate energetic costs with some structural features, like crossings of multiple&lt;br /&gt;Jahn&amp;ndash;Teller axes, the location of these axes, or the involved ligands. It is found that the different oxidation states localize&lt;br /&gt;on different Mn centers, giving rise to clear Jahn&amp;ndash;Teller distortions, unlike in previous crystallographic findings where an&lt;br /&gt;apparent valence delocalization was found. The low barriers that connect different Jahn&amp;ndash;Teller axis arrangements suggest&lt;br /&gt;that the system quickly interconverts between them, leading to the observation of averaged bond lengths in the crystal&lt;br /&gt;structure. We conclude that the combination of cubane&#8208;vanadate bonds that are chemically inert, cubane&#8208;acetate/water&lt;br /&gt;bonds that can be activated through a Jahn&amp;ndash;Teller axis, and low activation barriers for intramolecular rearrangement of&lt;br /&gt;the Jahn&amp;ndash;Teller axes plays an essential role in the reactivity of this and probably related compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>

         <title>Lanthanide Identity Governs Guest&#8208;Induced Dimerization in LnIII[15&#8208;MCCuIIN(L&#8208;pheHA)&#8208;5])3+&#160;Metallacrowns</title>

         <dc:description>Series of lanthanide&#8208;containing metallic coordination complexes are frequently presented as structurally analogous, due to the similar chemical and coordinative properties of the lanthanides. In the case of chiral (Ln  III  [15&#8208;MC  Cu  II  N(L&#8208;pheHA)  &#8208;5])  3+  metallacrowns (MCs), which are well established supramolecular hosts, the formation of dimers templated by a dicarboxylate guest (muconate) in solution of neutral pH is herein shown to have a unique dependence on the identity of the MC&#8217;s central lanthanide.&#160;Calorimetric data and nuclear magnetic resonance diffusion studies demonstrate that MCs containing larger or smaller lanthanides as the central metal only form monomeric host&#8208;guest complexes whereas analogues with intermediate lanthanides (  e.g.  , Eu, Gd, Dy)&#160; participate in formation of dimeric host&#8208;guest&#8208;host compartments. The driving force for the dimerization event across the series is thought to be a competition between formation of highly stable MCs (larger lanthanides) and optimally linked bridging guests (smaller lanthanides).</dc:description>

         <title>How to Look for Compounds: Predictive Screening and in&#8197;situ Studies in Na&#8722;Zn&#8722;Bi System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structure prediction algorithm was used to assess the stability of the ternary compounds in the Na&#8722;Zn&#8722;Bi system followed by rapid experimental screening via the hydride synthesis route and in&#8197;situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. Such a synergistic approach has yielded four new compounds in the previously &#8220;empty&#8221; Na&#8722;Zn&#8722;Bi system. The advanced electronic structure calculation for the synthesized compounds were performed to rationalize the experimentally observed non&#8208;stoichiometry, while in&#8197;situ powder X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed the high&#8208;temperature polymorphism.







Abstract
Here, the combination of theoretical computations followed by rapid experimental screening and in&#8197;situ diffraction studies is demonstrated as a powerful strategy for novel compounds discovery. When applied for the previously &#8220;empty&#8221; Na&#8722;Zn&#8722;Bi system, such an approach led to four novel phases. The compositional space of this system was rapidly screened via the hydride route method and the theoretically predicted NaZnBi (PbClF type, P4/nmm) and Na11Zn2Bi5 (Na11Cd2Sb5 type, P
) phases were successfully synthesized, while other computationally generated compounds on the list were rejected. In addition, single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies of NaZnBi indicate minor deviations from the stoichiometric 1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1 molar ratio. As a result, two isostructural (PbClF type, P4/nmm) Zn&#8208;deficient phases with similar compositions, but distinctly different unit cell parameters were discovered. The vacancies on Zn sites and unit cell expansion were rationalized from bonding analysis using electronic structure calculations on stoichiometric &#8220;NaZnBi&#8221;. In&#8208;situ synchrotron powder X&#8208;ray diffraction studies shed light on complex equilibria in the Na&#8722;Zn&#8722;Bi system at elevated temperatures. In particular, the high&#8208;temperature polymorph HT&#8208;Na3Bi (BiF3 type, Fm
m) was obtained as a product of Na11Zn2Bi5 decomposition above 611&#8197;K. HT&#8208;Na3Bi cannot be stabilized at room temperature by quenching, and this type of structure was earlier observed in the high&#8208;pressure polymorph HP&#8208;Na3Bi above 0.5&#8197;GPa. The aforementioned approach of predictive synthesis can be extended to other multinary systems.

         <title>Lewis Acid&#8208;Promoted Oxidative Addition at a [Ni0(diphosphine)2] Complex: The Critical Role of a Secondary Coordination Sphere</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The elementary steps of metal&#8208;mediated catalysis e.&#8201;g., oxidative addition, transmetalation, and reductive elimination are pertinent to the design of superior routes into specialty chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals. For over 50&#8197;years, pioneering work has shown that 18&#8208;electron alkyl/aryl&#8208;substituted diphosphine complexes of Group 10 [M(diphosphine)2] do not oxidatively add haloarenes. Herein, we report a compound that is contrary to this &#8216;rule&#8217;, advancing our understanding of oxidative addition at coordinatively saturated organometallic complexes and providing new opportunities for bond activation.







Abstract
Oxidative addition represents a critical elementary step in myriad catalytic transformations. Here, the importance of thoughtful ligand design cannot be overstated. In this work, we report the intermolecular activation of iodobenzene (PhI) at a coordinatively saturated 18&#8208;electron [Ni0(diphosphine)2] complex bearing a Lewis acidic secondary coordination sphere. Whereas alkyl&#8208;substituted diphosphine complexes of Group 10 are known to be unreactive in such reactions, we show that [Ni0(P2BCy4)2] (P2BCy4=1,2&#8208;bis(di(3&#8208;dicyclohexylboraneyl)&#8208;propylphosphino)ethane) is competent for room&#8208;temperature PhI cleavage to give [NiII(P2BCy4)(Ph)(I)]. This difference in oxidative addition reactivity has been scrutinized computationally &#8211; an outcome that is borne out in ring&#8208;opening to provide the reactive precursor &#8211; for [Ni0(P2BCy4)2], a &#8220;boron&#8208;trapped&#8221; 16&#8208;electron &#954;1&#8208;diphosphine Ni(0) complex. Moreover, formation of [NiII(P2BCy4)(Ph)(I)] is inherent to the P2BCy4 secondary coordination sphere: treatment of the Lewis adduct, [Ni0(P2BCy4)2(DMAP)8] with PhI provides [NiII(P2BCy4)2(DMAP)8(I)]I via iodine&#8208;atom abstraction and not a [NiII(Ph)(I)(diphosphine)] compound &#8211; an unusual secondary sphere effect. Finally, the reactivity of [Ni0(P2BCy4)2] with 4&#8208;iodopyridine was surveyed, which resulted in a pyridyl&#8208;borane linked oligomer. The implications of these outcomes are discussed in the context of designing strongly donating, and yet labile diphosphine ligands for use in a critical bond activation step relevant to catalysis.

         <title>Full&#8208;Atom Model of the Agonist LPS&#8208;Bound Toll&#8208;like Receptor 4 Dimer in a Membrane Environment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pushing against the limits of all&#8208;atom molecular dynamics simulations&#8242; capability, the agonist lipopolysaccharide&#8208;bound full&#8208;length Toll&#8208;like receptor 4 dimer complex, embedded into a realistic plasma membrane, is addressed. Atomic/molecular and thermodynamic insights are provided for TLR4&#8242;s assembly and biological activity.







Abstract
The Toll&#8208;like receptor 4 (TLR4)/myeloid differentiation factor 2 (MD&#8208;2) innate immunity system is a membrane receptor of paramount importance as therapeutic target. Its assembly, upon binding of Gram&#8208;negative bacteria lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and also dependent on the membrane composition, finally triggers the immune response cascade. We have combined ab&#8208;initio calculations, molecular docking, all&#8208;atom molecular dynamics simulations, and thermodynamics calculations to provide the most realistic and complete 3D models of the active full TLR4 complex embedded into a realistic membrane to date. Our studies give functional and structural insights into the transmembrane domain behavior in different membrane environments, the ectodomain bouncing movement, and the dimerization patterns of the intracellular Toll/Interleukin&#8208;1 receptor domain. Our work provides TLR4 models as reasonable 3D structures for the (TLR4/MD&#8208;2/LPS)2 architecture accounting for the active (agonist) state of the TLR4, and pointing to a signal transduction mechanism across cell membrane. These observations unveil relevant molecular aspects involved in the TLR4 innate immune pathways and will promote the discovery of new TLR4 modulators.

Tetracyanobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene (TCBD) is a powerful and versatile electron&#8208;acceptor moiety widely used for the preparation of electroactive conjugates. Here, we expand the chemical space of such moiety through a high&#8208;yielding cyano&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder synthesis of a novel, thermally&#8208;stable anthryl&#8208;fused&#8208;TCBD derivative which presents intriguing physicochemical properties.







Abstract
Tetracyanobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene (TCBD) is a powerful and versatile electron&#8208;acceptor moiety widely used for the preparation of electroactive conjugates. While many reports addressing its electron&#8208;accepting capability have appeared in the literature, significantly scarcer are those dealing with its chemical modification, a relevant topic which allows to broaden the chemical space of this interesting functional unit. Here, we report on the first example of a high&#8208;yielding cyano&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder (CDA) reaction between TCBD, that is, where a nitrile group acts as a dienophile, and an anthryl moiety, that is, acting as a diene. The resulting anthryl&#8208;fused&#8208;TCBD derivative, which structure was unambiguously identified by X&#8208;ray diffraction, shows high thermal stability, remarkable electron&#8208;accepting capability, and interesting electronic ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state features, as characterized by a thorough theoretical, electrochemical, and photophysical investigation. Moreover, a detailed kinetic analysis of the intramolecular CDA reaction transforming the anthryl&#8208;TCBD&#8208;based reactant into the anthryl&#8208;fused&#8208;TCBD product was carried out at different temperatures.

         <title>Thermal Expansion Properties and Mechanochemical Synthesis of Stoichiometric Cocrystals Containing Tetrabromobenzene as a Hydrogen&#8208; and Halogen&#8208;Bond Donor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermal expansion defines by composition: Cocrystals containing different stoichiometric ratios of the components 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrabromobenzene (TBrB) and 4,4&#8242;&#8208;azobipyridine (Azo) exhibit dramatically different thermal expansion (TE) behaviors. The components in the stoichiometric cocrystals interact through hydrogen or hydrogen/halogen bonds and differ in &#960;&#8208;stacking arrangements. The structural differences results in the unique TE behaviors for each solid. The cocrystals form concomitantly, and mechanochemical synthesis demonstrates that mixtures or pure phases can be synthesized by varying the feed ratios of the components.







Abstract
The solution and mechanochemical synthesis of two cocrystals that differ in the stoichiometric ratio of the components (stoichiometric cocrystals) is reported. The components in the stoichiometric cocrystals interact through hydrogen or hydrogen/halogen bonds and differ in &#960;&#8208;stacking arrangements. The difference in structure and noncovalent interactions affords dramatically different thermal expansion behaviors in the two cocrystals. At certain molar ratios, the cocrystals are obtained concomitantly; however, by varying the ratios, a single stoichiometric cocrystal is achieved using mechanochemistry.

         <title>Turning the Light on Phenols: New Opportunities in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phenols in the spotlight: Phenol and its derivatives are key moieties in organic chemistry. Conventionally, they are prepared through thermal functionalization strategies that present several drawbacks. Recently, alternative photochemical approaches have been implemented that involves phenols both as light&#8208;harvesting substrates or as photo&#8208;redox catalysts. This Minireview summarizes the most relevant examples within this field, highlighting the great versatility of simple phenolic frameworks in organic synthesis.







Abstract
Phenols (I) are extremely relevant chemical functionalities in natural, synthetic and industrial chemistry. Their corresponding electron&#8208;rich anions, namely phenolates (I), are characterized by interesting physicochemical properties that can be drastically altered upon light excitation. Specifically, phenolates (I) become strong reducing agents in the excited state and are able to generate reactive radicals from suitable precursors via single&#8208;electron transfer processes. Thus, these species can photochemically trigger strategic bond&#8208;forming reactions, including their direct aromatic C&#8722;H functionalization. Moreover, substituted phenolate anions can act as photocatalysts to enable synthetically useful organic transformations. An alternative mechanistic manifold is represented by the ability of phenolate derivatives I to form ground state electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes with electron&#8208;poor radical sources. These complementary scenarios have paved the way for the development of a wide range of relevant organic reactions. In this Minireview, we present the main examples of this research field, and give insight on emerging trends in phenols photocatalysis towards richer organic synthesis.

         <title>Elastic Organic Crystals Based on Barbituric Derivative: Multi&#8208;faceted Bending and Flexible Optical Waveguide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A molecule (DBDT) was synthesized by a simple one&#8208;step reaction, and the centimeter&#8208;scale needle&#8208;like crystals were prepared by slow volatilization in DCM/CH3OH (v/v=2/8). Upon applying or removing the mechanical force, both the (100) and (040) faces of the needle&#8208;like crystal showed reversible bending behaviour, showing the nature of multi&#8208;faceted bending. Fortunately, the elastic crystals also exhibited optical waveguide characteristics in straight or bent state.







Abstract
Elastic organic single crystals with light&#8208;emitting and multi&#8208;faceted bending properties are extremely rare. They have potential application in optical materials and have attracted the extensive attention of researchers. In this paper, we reported a structurally simple barbituric derivative DBDT, which was easily crystallized and gained long needle&#8208;like crystals (centimeter&#8208;scale) in DCM/CH3OH (v/v=2/8). Upon applying or removing the mechanical force, both the (100) and (040) faces of the needle&#8208;like crystal showed reversible bending behaviour, showing the nature of multi&#8208;faceted bending. The average hardness (H) and elastic modulus (E) were 0.28&#177;0.01&#8197;GPa and 4.56&#177;0.03&#8197;GPa for the (040) plane, respectively. Through the analysis of the single crystal data, it could be seen that the van der waals (C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C), H&#8208;bond (C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O) and &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions between molecules were responsible for the generation of the crystal elasticity. Interestingly, elastic crystals exhibited optical waveguide characteristics in straight or bent state. The optical loss coefficients measured at 627&#8197;nm were 0.7&#8197;dBmm&#8722;1 (straight state) and 0.9&#8197;dBmm&#8722;1 (bent state), while the optical loss coefficient (&#945;) were 1.5&#8197;dBmm&#8722;1 (straight state) and 1.8&#8197;dBmm&#8722;1 (bent state) at 567&#8197;nm. Notably, the elastic organic molecular crystal based on barbituric derivative could be used as the candidate for flexible optical devices.

         <title>Kinetic Stabilization of Blue&#8208;Emissive Anthracenes: Phenylene Bridging Works Best</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In attempts at kinetically stabilizing blue&#8208;emissive anthracenes a series of 9,10&#8208;biarylated derivatives were investigated. Bis&#8208;meta&#8208;terphenylyl substitution highly increased photochemical and photooxidative stability. Ring closure to [6]cyclo&#8208;meta&#8208;hexaphenylene bridged anthracene increased protection even further resulting in an additional stabilization.







Abstract
In attempts at kinetically stabilizing blue&#8208;emissive anthracenes, a series of 9,10&#8208;diaryl substituted derivatives were tested for their photochemical and photooxidative persistence. A major breakthrough in light fastness comes from a new bis&#8208;meta&#8208;terphenylyl substituted anthracene which is much superior to industrially relevant 9,10&#8208;biarylated anthracenes. The key issue is the steric shielding of the anthracene core. Further, intramolecular ring closure via Yamamoto coupling furnished a doubly bridged anthracene as a &#8220;self&#8208;encapsulated&#8221; sky&#8208;blue emitter which is most resistant to photodegradation. The improved stabilization was corroborated by time&#8208;resolved irradiation experiments and rationalized by X&#8208;ray crystallography.

&lt;p&gt;In attempts at kinetically stabilizing blue-emissive anthracenes, a series of 9,10-diaryl substituted derivatives were tested for their photochemical and photooxidative persistence. A major breakthrough in light fastness comes from a new bis-&lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;-terphenylyl substituted anthracene which is much superior to industrially relevant 9,10-biarylated anthracenes. The key issue is the steric shielding of the anthracene core. Further, intramolecular ring closure via Yamamoto coupling furnished a doubly bridged anthracene as a &#8220;self-encapsulated&#8221; sky-blue emitter which is most resistant to photodegradation. The improved stabilization was corroborated by time-resolved irradiation experiments and rationalized by X-ray crystallography.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Molecular Photosensitizer in a Porous Block Copolymer Matrix&#8208;Implications for the Design of Photocatalytically Active Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ru photosensitizer covalently bound to a porous block copolymer membrane to be used in photocatalytic systems exhibits an additional charge transfer process unobserved in aprotic solvents due to protonation from water molecules absorbed in the polymer. The inhomogeneity due to different orientations of the bound photosensitizer together with its rigidity in the polymer could serve as important set screws for controlling the overall photocatalytic efficiency.







Abstract
Recently, porous photocatalytically active block copolymer membranes were introduced, based on heterogenized molecular catalysts. Here, we report the integration of the photosensitizer, i.&#8201;e., the light absorbing unit in an intermolecular photocatalytic system into block copolymer membranes in a covalent manner. We study the resulting structure and evaluate the orientational mobility of the photosensitizer as integral part of the photocatalytic system in such membranes. To this end we utilize transient absorption anisotropy, highlighting the temporal reorientation of the transition dipole moment probed in a femtosecond pump&#8208;probe experiment. Our findings indicate that the photosensitizer is rigidly bound to the polymer membrane and shows a large heterogeneity of absolute anisotropy values as a function of location probed within the matrix. This reflects the sample inhomogeneity arising from different protonation states of the photosensitizer and different intermolecular interactions of the photosensitizers within the block copolymer membrane scaffold.

         <title>Explaining the Advantageous Impact of Tertiary versus Secondary Nitrogen Centre on the Activity of PNP&#8208;Pincer Co(I)&#8208;Complexes for Catalytic Hydrogenation of CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pincer ligated coordination complexes of base metals have shown remarkable catalytic activity for hydrogenation/dehydrogenation of CO  2  .&#160;The recently reported MeN[CH  2  CH  2  i  Pr  2  )]  2  Co(I)PNP&#8208;pincer complex was shown to exhibit substantially higher catalytic activity in comparison to the corresponding catalyst,&#160; HN[CH  2  CH  2  i  Pr  2  )]  2  Co(I)PNP, bearing a secondary nitrogen center on the pincer ligand. Here, we computationally investigate the mechanisms for hydrogenation of CO  2  to formate catalyzed by these two Co&#8208;PNP complexes to explain how such a small structural difference could have a sizable impact on their catalytic activity. Plausible hydrogenation routes were examined in details and our findings provide solid support for the experimental observations. Our results reveal that such trends in catalytic activity could be explained from the lower activation barrier for the hydride transfer step upon changing the pincer nitrogen center from secondary to tertiary.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective [2+2+1] Hydrative Annulation of Phenol&#8208;Linked 1,6&#8208;Enynes With Acetylenes Through Rhodium Catalysis: A Rapid Access to Cyclopenta[b]benzofuranols**</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An unprecedented [2+2+1] hydrative annulation of 1,6&#8208;enynes with terminal alkynes is achieved using catalytic cationic Rh(I). Thus, a modular assembly of cyclopenta[b]benzofuranols with two consecutive quarternary stereocenters is achieved from readily available alkynes. The reaction is proposed to go through a sequence of 5&#8208;membered rhoda&#8208;cycle formation, regioselective acetylene insertion, 1,5 H&#8208;shift, substrate controlled stereoselective addition of water molecule followed by 1,2&#8208;rhodium migration gave contracted rhoda&#8208;cycle D and reductive elimination. Necessary control/labelling experiments were conducted to gain insight in to the mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical Hydrogen Evolution at Metal Centers Probed with Hydrated Aluminum Cations, Al+(H2O)n, n = 1&#8211;10</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrated aluminum cations are investigated as a photochemical model system with up to 10 water molecules by UV action spectroscopy in a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT&#8208;ICR) mass spectrometer. Intense photodissociation has been observed starting at 4.5 eV ranging from two to eight water molecules by loss of atomic hydrogen, molecular hydrogen and water molecules. Quantum chemical calculations for  n  = 2 reveal that solvation shifts the intense 3s&#8208;3p excitations of Al+  into the investigated photon energy range below 5.5 eV. During the photochemical relaxation, internal conversion from S1  to T2  takes place, and photochemical hydrogen formation starts on the T2  surface, which passes through a conical intersection, changing to T1  . On this triplet surface, the electron that was excited to the Al 3p orbital is transferred to a coordinated water molecule, which dissociates into a hydroxide ion and a hydrogen atom. If the system remains in the triplet state, this hydrogen radical is lost directly. If the system returns to singlet multiplicity, the reaction may be reversed, with recombination with the hydroxide moiety and electron transfer back to aluminum, resulting in water evaporation. Alternatively, the hydrogen radical can attack the intact water molecule, forming molecular hydrogen and aluminum dihydroxide. Photodissociation is observed up to  n  = 8. Clusters with  n  = 9,10 occur exclusively as HAlOH+(H2O)n  &#8211;1  and are transparent in the investigated energy range. For  n  = 4&#8211;8, a mixture of Al+(H2O)n  and HAlOH+(H2O)n  &#8211;1  is present in the experiment.</dc:description>

These crystals exhibited unique mechano&#8208; and thermo&#8208;responsive disordering, crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal phase transition, and SCSC phase transition. Especially, rapid thermo&#8208;stimulus SCSC occurred from the blue&#8208;PL  cI  into greenish blue&#8208;PL  cII  . Interestingly, the SCSC phase transition of the  cI  into the  cII  was triggered by thermal stimuli and propagated spontaneously.&#160;Thermo&#8208;triggered domino&#8208;like SCSC phase transition was observed on a fully visible timescale (approximately 125 &#181;m/min).</dc:description>

         <dc:description>This paper reports the first example of C&#8211;H arylation of benzene under mild conditions, using H  2  as an electron source {turnover numbers (TONs) = 0.7&#8211;2.0 for 24 h}. The reaction depends on a Rh&#8208;based electron storage catalyst, and proceeds at room temperature and in aqueous solution. Furthermore, the H  2  is inactive during the radical transfer step, greatly reducing unwanted side reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Dehydrogenative C&#8211;H Silylation of Alkynylsilanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report that a cobalt catalyst permits the general synthesis of substituted alkynylsilanes via dehydrogenative coupling of alkylnylsilanes and hydrosilanes. Several silylated alkynes were prepared in a one&#8208;step procedure, including di&#8208; and trisubstituted ones. 36 compounds were synthesized for the first time applying our catalyst system. The alkynylsilanes bearing hydrosilyl moieties provide an opportunity for further functionalizations (e.g., hydrosilylation). &#160;The use of primary silanes as substrates and pre&#8208;catalyst activators permits the utilization of inexpensive and easily accessible 3d metal pre&#8208;catalysts and avoids the presence of additional activators.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electron&#8208;rich Pt complex [Pt(IMes)  2  ] (IMes: [1,3bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;imidazolinylidine]) can be used as precursor for the syntheses of a variety of fluorido ligand containing compounds. The sulfur fluoride SF  4  undergoes a rapid oxidative addition at Pt  0  to yield  trans  &#8208;[Pt(F)(SF  3  )(IMes)  2  ]. A photolytic reaction of SF  6  at [Pt(IMes)  2  ] in the presence of IMes gave the fluorido complexes  trans  &#8208;[Pt(F)  2  (IMes)  2  ] and  trans  &#8208;[Pt(F)(SF  3  )(IMes)  2  ] along with  trans  &#8208;[Pt(F)(SOF)(IMes)  2  ] and  trans  &#8208;[Pt(F)(IMes&#8217;)(IMes)] (IMes&#8217;: cyclometalated IMes ligand), the latter being products produced by reaction with adventitious water.  trans  &#8208;[Pt(F)(SOF)(IMes)  2  ] and  trans  [Pt(F)  2  (IMes)  2  ] were synthesized independently by treatment of [Pt(IMes)  2  ] with SOF  2  or XeF  2  .

Long&#8208;chain oligosaccharides of &#946;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;linked  N  &#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine (GlcNAc) units indeed activate plants and mammals innate immune system. However, the mechanisms underlying PAMPs perception by lysine motif (LysM) domain receptors remain largely unknown because of insufficient availability of high&#8208;affinity molecular probes. Here, we report a two&#8208;enzyme cascade to synthesize long&#8208;chain &#946;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;linked GlcNAc oligomers. Expression of the D52S mutant of hen egg&#8208;white lysozyme (HEWL) in  Pichia pastoris  at 52 mg.L  &#8208;1  provided a new glycosynthase catalyzing efficient polymerization of &#945;&#8208;chitintriosyl fluoride. Selective  N  &#8208;deacetylation at the non&#8208;reducing unit of the glycosyl fluoride donor by  Sinorhizobium meliloti  NodB chitin&#8208;  N  &#8208;deacetylase abolished its ability to be polymerized by the glycosynthase but not to be transferred onto an acceptor. Using NodB and D52S HEWL in a one&#8208;pot cascade reaction allowed the synthesis of chitin hexa&#8208;, hepta&#8208; and octasaccharides with yields up to 65% and a perfect control over their size.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantiodivergent One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Axially Chiral Biaryls Using Organocatalyst&#8208;Mediated Enantioselective Domino Reaction and Central&#8208;to&#8208;Axial Chirality Conversion</title>

         <dc:description>
Enantiodivergent one&#8208;pot synthesis of axially chiral biaryls was developed using a catalytic amount of a chiral source. A domino organocatalyst&#8208;mediated enantioselective Michael/aldol condensation and enantiodivergent central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality conversion afforded chiral biaryls with excellent enantioselectivity in a single reaction vessel. A plausible reaction mechanism for the enantiodivergence was proposed.







Abstract
Enantiodivergent one&#8208;pot synthesis of biaryls was developed using a catalytic amount of a single chiral source. A domino organocatalyst&#8208;mediated enantioselective Michael reaction and aldol condensation provided centrally chiral dihydronaphthalenes with excellent enantioselectivity, from which an enantiodivergent chirality conversion from central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality was achieved. Both enantiomers of biaryls were obtained with excellent enantioselectivity. All transformations can be conducted in a single reaction vessel. A plausible reaction mechanism for the enantiodivergence is proposed.

Novel alkynyl&#8208;functionalized diarylbis(dimethylamino)diboranes(4) were prepared and reacted with mono&#8208; and dihydroboranes, leading to hydroboration of the alkyne groups. The products are discrete boryl&#8208;appended diborane(4) species and oligomeric species, and are the first known examples of well&#8208;characterized macromolecular species with boron&#8208;boron bonds. The oligomeric products were found to comprise up to ten repeat units, and are soluble in common organic solvents.







Abstract
A number of novel alkynyl&#8208;functionalized diarylbis(dimethylamino)diboranes(4) are prepared by salt metathesis, and the appended alkynyl groups are subjected to hydroboration. Their reactions with monohydroboranes lead to discrete boryl&#8208;appended diborane(4) species, while dihydroboranes induce their catenation to oligomeric species, the first known examples of well&#8208;characterized macromolecular species with B&#8722;B bonds. The oligomeric species were found to comprise up to ten repeat units and are soluble in common organic solvents. Some of the oligomeric species have good air stability and all were characterized by NMR and vibrational spectroscopy and size&#8208;exclusion chromatography techniques.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Syntheses and Catalytic Applications of Homonuclear Ru&#8208;, Rh&#8208;, and Ir&#8208;Complexes of CNHC^C Cyclometalated Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclometalation is one of the modest ways to access vibrant metallacycles via C&#8722;H activation. The simple modifications in NHC based ligands and synthesis procedure may generate a library of cyclometalated complexes with varying stereoelectronic properties. This Minireview is the collection of recently (2015&#8211;May 2021) reported examples of Ru&#8208;, Rh&#8208;, and Ir&#8208;based CNHC^C cyclometalated complexes (synthesis and reactivity) and their applications in homogeneous catalysis.







Abstract
In the past few decades, chemistry of cyclometalated species has gained momentum with increased applications in several areas of scientific developments. Cyclometalation reactions result in the formation of stable metallacycles through the generation of metal&#8208;carbon covalent bonds by activating the unreactive Csp2&#8208;H or Csp3&#8208;H bonds. The extra stability gained by the formation of metallacycles enhances their applicability scopes especially in the area of homogeneous catalysis. In the recent research development in this area, NHC ligands (strong &#963;&#8208;donor and generally, weak &#960;&#8208;acceptor) have been found to be one of the most suitable candidates for the intramolecular C&#8722;H activation process which leads to the cyclometalated species. The growth in the area of cyclometalation chemistry that started in the late 20th century is still continuing and in the past few decades, various examples of NHC derived transition metal&#8208;based cyclometalated complexes came into the picture. As covering all the reported literatures in this area (includes mainly late transition metals) will exceed the limits of minireview, we restricted ourselves to the recent (2015 &#8211; May 2021) examples of the most common Ru&#8208;, Rh&#8208;, and Ir&#8208;based CNHC^C cyclometalated complexes and their applications in various homogeneous catalytic conversions such as transfer hydrogenation, amidation, oxidation of alcohols, annulations, and so forth.

         <title>Diphosphino&#8208;Functionalized 1,8&#8208;Naphthyridines: a Multifaceted Ligand Platform for Boranes and Diboranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Five diphosphino&#8208;functionalized 1,8&#8208;naphthyridine (NDP)&#8208;based boron compounds were synthesized via two different methods: direct coordination and salt elimination. In these NDP&#8208;based boron compounds, NDP behaves as a flexible, multifaceted ligand. For example, it functions as a tridentate ligand toward B2Br4 and as a bidentate ligand for BBr3. Furthermore, NDP binds through only one nitrogen to a diaminodiborane to furnish tri&#8208; and tetraamino diboranes.







Abstract
A 1,8&#8208;naphthyridine diphosphine (NDP) reacts with boron&#8208;containing Lewis acids to generate complexes featuring a number of different naphthyridine bonding modes. When exposed to diborane B2Br4, NDP underwent self&#8208;deprotonation to afford [NDP&#8208;B2Br3]Br, an unsymmetrical diborane comprised of four fused rings. The reaction of two equivalents of monoborane BBr3 and NDP in a non&#8208;polar solvent provided the simple phosphine&#8208;borane adduct [NDP(BBr3)2], which then underwent intramolecular halide abstraction to furnish the salt [NDP&#8208;BBr2][BBr4], featuring a different coordination mode from that of [NDP&#8208;B2Br3]Br. Direct deprotonation of NDP by KHMDS or PhCH2K generates mono&#8208; and dipotassium reagents, respectively. The monopotassium reagent reacts with one or half an equivalent of B2(NMe2)2Cl2 to afford NDP&#8208;based diboranes with three or four amino substituents.

         <title>Highly Efficient Simulated Solar Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic Degradation of 4&#8208;Nitrophenol over CdS/Carbon/MoSx Hybrids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photocatalytic system is readily synthesized through a microwave&#8208;assisted hydrothermal process. The CdS/MoSx heterojunction using ascorbic acid&#8208;derived carbon as cocatalyst degrades 4&#8208;nitrophenol about 9 times faster than neat CdS. The enhancement of photocatalytic activity towards the degradation of an organic pollutant originates from efficient charge separation in the formed heterojunctions.







Abstract
Among the various organic pollutants and industrial chemicals, 4&#8208;nitrophenol has been one of the most monitored substances in aqueous environments, due to its enhanced solubility in such systems. This research reports for the first time the microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis of CdS/carbon/MoSx hybrids and the subsequent utilization of such systems as photocatalysts for 4&#8208;nitrophenol degradation. The hybrids demonstrated a variable photocatalytic activity, by using a variety of organic substances as precursors for the solvothermal carbonization step. By using ascorbic acid as precursor, the corresponding ternary composite exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity, with the 4&#8208;nitrophenol concentration been almost quantitatively decayed within 45&#8197;min of irradiation. This could be ascribed due to the generation of a high population of heterojunctions as well as the chemical speciation of Mo&#8208;based nanostructures. Such ternary hybrids may be utilized as potential photocatalytic systems in processes, where removal of toxic water&#8208;soluble substances is the key issue.

Glipizide and glibenclamide remain some of the widely prescribed antidiabetic sulfonylurea drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Semi&#8208;telescoped continuous flow synthesis of both glipizide and glibenclamide are demonstrated herein which is accompanied by an overall yield of 80&#8211;85&#8201;% within 10&#8197;min total residence time.







Abstract
Glipizide and glibenclamide remain some of the widely prescribed antidiabetic sulfonylurea drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Herein the authors report on an isocyanate&#8208;free synthetic procedure towards the preparation of these on demand drugs at multigram scale using continuous flow technology. The safety concern over the use of isocyanates in most of the existing synthetic routes was dealt with in this present work by using N&#8208;carbamates synthesised in&#8197;situ from activation of amines with chloroformates as safer alternatives. An overall yield of 80&#8211;85&#8201;% was obtained for the semi&#8208;telescoped steps within 10&#8197;min total residence time.

         <title>Donor&#8208;Stabilised [SbF4]+: SbF5 as a Fluoride&#8208;Ion Donor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ability of the strong Lewis acid SbF5 to act as a fluoride&#8208;ion donor has been demonstrated for the first time through the synthesis of donor&#8208;stabilised [SbF4]+ cations. In the presence of bidentate N&#8208;donor ligands, SbF5 undergoes ligand&#8208;induced autoionisation to yield robust [SbF4(L&#8722;L)]+ (L&#8722;L=2,2&#8217;bipyridine or 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline) salts. DFT calculations and NBO analyses show strong Sb&#8722;N interactions that are necessary to stabilise the [SbF4]+ cation.







Abstract
Antimony pentafluoride is a strong Lewis acid and fluoride&#8208;ion acceptor that has not previously demonstrated any discreet fluoride&#8208;ion donor properties. The first donor&#8208;stabilised [SbF4]+ cations were prepared from the autoionisation of SbF5 in the presence of bidentate N&#8208;donor ligands 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (bipy) and 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (phen) as their [SbF6]&#8722; salts. The [SbF4(N&#8722;N)][Sb2F11] (N&#8722;N=bipy, phen) salts were synthesised by the addition of one equivalent of SbF5&#8901;SO2 to [SbF4(N&#8722;N)][SbF6] in liquid SO2. The salts show remarkable stability and were characterised by Raman spectroscopy and multinuclear NMR spectroscopy. The crystal structures of [SbF4(phen)][SbF6]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3CH3CN and [SbF4(phen)][SbF6]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2SO2 were determined, showing distorted octahedral cations. DFT calculations and NBO analyses reveal that significant degree of electron&#8208;pair donation from N to Sb stabilizes [SbF4]+ with the Sb&#8722;N bond strength being approximately two thirds of that of the Sb&#8722;F bonds in these cations and the cationic charge being primarily ligand&#8208;centred.

         <title>Advancing inorganic coordination chemistry by spectroscopy of isolated molecules: methods and applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A unique feature of the work carried out in the Collaborative Research Center 3MET continues to be its emphasis on innovative, advanced experimental methods which hyphenate mass&#8208;selection with further analytical tools such as laser spectroscopy for the study of  isolated  molecular ions. This allows to probe the intrinsic properties of the species of interest free of perturbing solvent or matrix effects. This review explains these methods and uses examples from past and ongoing 3MET studies of specific classes of multicenter metal complexes to illustrate how coordination chemistry can be advanced by applying them. As a corollary, we will show how the challenges involved in providing well&#8208;defined, e.g. monoisomeric, samples of the molecular ions have helped to further improve the methods themselves thus also making them applicable to many other areas of chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>THF&#8208;solvated Heavy Alkali Metal Benzyl Compounds (Na, Rb, Cs): Defined Deprotonation Reagents for Alkali Metal Mediation Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incorporation of heavy alkali metals into substrates is both challenging and essential for many reactions. Here, we report the formation of thf&#8208;solvated alkali metal benzyl compounds [PhCH  2  M(thf)  n  ] ( M = Na, Rb, Cs). The synthesis was carried out by deprotonation of toluene with the bimetallic mixture n&#8208;butyllithium/alkali metal&#160;tert&#8208;butoxide&#160;and selective crystallization from thf of the defined benzyl compounds. Insights into the molecular structure in the solid as well as in solution state are gained by single crystal X&#8208;ray experiments and NMR spectroscopic studies. The compounds could be successfully used as alkali metal mediating reagents. The example of caesium showed the convenient use by deprotonating acidic C&#8211;H as well as N&#8211;H compounds to gain insight into the aminometalation using these reagents.</dc:description>

         <title>The Effect of Water on the 2&#8208;Propanol Oxidation Activity of Co&#8208;Substituted LaFe1&#8208;xCoxO3 Perovskites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perovskites are interesting oxidation catalysts due to their chemical flexibility enabling the tuning of several properties. In this work, we synthesized LaFe  1&#8208;x  Co  x  O  3  catalysts by co&#8208;precipitation and thermal decomposition, characterized them thoroughly and studied their 2&#8208;propanol oxidation activity under dry and wet conditions to bridge the knowledge gap between gas and liquid phase reactions. Transient tests showed a highly active, unstable low&#8208;temperature (LT) reaction channel in conversion profiles and a stable, less&#8208;active high&#8208;temperature (HT) channel. Cobalt incorporation had a positive effect on the activity. The effect of water was negative on the LT channel, whereas the HT channel activity was boosted for x&gt;0.15. The boost maybe originated from a slower deactivation rate of the Co  3+  sites under wet conditions and a higher amount of hydroxide species on the surface comparing wet and dry feeds. Water addition resulted in a slower deactivation for Co&#8208;rich catalysts and higher activity in the HT channel state.</dc:description>

         <title>Position Matters: Fluorescent Positional Isomers for Reversible Multichannel Encryption Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescence signals have been widely used in information encryption for a few decades, but still suffer from limited reliability. Here, reversible multichannel fluorescent devices with encrypted information were constructed, based on two fluorescent positional isomers of a diphenylquinoxaline derivative. Possessing the same core fluorescent group and acid&#8208;/pH&#8208;responsive mechanism, the two isomers showed different fluorescence color in an acidic environment, which allowed us to realize stepwise encryption of information in orthogonal fluorescence channels. Since the protonation was reversible, the revealed information could be re&#8208;encrypted, simply by heating. This approach highlights the value of positional isomers to build multichannel encryption devices, improving their reliability on the molecular level.</dc:description>

         <title>Fast and efficient postsynthetic DNA labeling in cells by means of strain&#8208;promoted sydnone&#8208;alkyne cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sydnones are highly stable mesoionic 1,3&#8208;dipoles that react with cyclooctynes via strain&#8208;promoted sydnone&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (SPSAC). While they have been shown to be valuable bioorthogonal chemical reporters for the labeling of proteins and complex glycans, nucleic acids, however, have not yet been tagged via SPSAC. Evaluation of the SPSAC kinetics with model substrates showed fast reactions with cyclooctyne probes (up to k=0.191 M&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and two different sydnones were effectively incorporated into both 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyuridines at position 5, and 7&#8208;deaza&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyadenosines at position 7. These modified nucleosides were synthetically incorporated into single&#8208;stranded DNA, which were successfully postsynthetically labeled with cyclooctyne probes both in vitro and in cells. These results show that sydnones are versatile bioorthogonal tags and have the premise to become essential tools for tracking DNA and potentially RNA in living cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable linear and nonlinear optical properties from room temperature phosphorescent cyclic triimidazole&#8208;pyrene bio&#8208;probe</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic materials with multiple emissions tunable by external stimuli represent a great challenge. TTPyr, crystallizing in different polymorphs, shows a very rich photophyisics comprising excitation&#8208;dependent fluorescence and phosphorescence at ambient conditions, and mechanochromic and thermochromic behavior. Transformation among the different species has been followed by thermal and X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and the emissive features interpreted through structural results and DFT/TDDFT calculations. Particularly intriguing is the polymorph obtained at high temperature, TTPyr(HT), whose non&#8208;centrosymmetric structure guarantees an SHG efficiency 10 times higher than that of standard urea. Its crystal packing, where only the TT units are strongly rigidified by &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions while the Pyr moieties possess partial conformational freedom, is responsible for the observed dual fluorescence. The potentialities of TTPyr for bioimaging have been successfully established.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208; and pH&#8208;regulated Water&#8208;soluble Pseudorotaxanes Comprising a Cucurbit[7]uril and a Flavylium&#8208;based Axle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A linear double pyridinium&#8208;terminated thread comprising a central chalcone moiety is shown to provide two independent binding sites with similar affinity for cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) macrocycles in water as judged from NMR, UV&#8208;Visible and fluorescence spectroscopies. Association results in [2] and [3]pseudorotaxanes, which are both pH and photosensitive. Switching from the neutral chalcone to the cationic flavylium form upon irradiation at 365 nm under acidic conditions provided an enhanced CB7 association (  K  1:1  &#160;increases from&#160;1.2&#160;x&#160;10  5  &#160;M  &#8722;1  &#160;to 1.5&#160;x&#160;10  8  &#160;M  &#8722;1  ), limiting spontaneous on&#8208;thread cucurbituril shuttling. This co&#8208;conformational change in the [2]pseudorotaxane is reversible in the dark with&#160;  k  obs  &#160;= 4.1&#160;x&#160;10  &#8208;4  &#160;s  &#8208;1  . Threading the flavylium moiety into CB7 leads to a 3&#8208;fold increase in the fluorescence quantum yield, from 0.29 in the free axle to 0.97 in the [2]pseudorotaxane and 1.0 in the [3]pseudorotaxane.</dc:description>

         <title>Controllable Macroscopic Chirality of Coordination Polymers through pH and Anion&#8208;Mediated Weak Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Helical architectures with controllable helical sense bias have recently attracted considerable interest for mimicking biological helices and developing novel chiral materials. Coordination polymers (CPs), composed of metal ion nodes and organic linkers, are intriguing systems showing tunable structures and functions. However, CPs with helical morphologies have rarely been explored so far. Particularly, chirality inversion through external stimulus has not been achieved in helical CPs. In this work, we carried out an in&#8208;depth investigation on the self&#8208;assembly of 1D gadolinium(III) phosphonate CPs using GdX  3  (X = Cl, Br, I) and Gd(RSO  3  ) (R = CH  3  , C  6  H  5  , CF  3  ) as metal sources and  R  &#8208;(1&#8208;phenylethylamino)methyl phosphonic acid (  R  &#8208;pempH  2  ) as ligand. Superhelices were formed by precise control of the interchain interactions through different intercalated anions. Furthermore, the twisting direction of superhelices could be controlled by the synergistic effect of anions and pH. This study may provide a new route to fabricate helical nanostructures of CPs with a desirable chiral sense and help understand the inner mechanism of the self&#8208;assembly process of macroscopic helical structures of molecular systems.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Native electrospray ionization (ESI) and nanoelectrospray ionization (nESI) allow researchers to analyze intact biomolecules and their complexes by mass spectrometry (MS). The data acquired using these soft ionization techniques provide a snapshot of a given biomolecules structure in solution. Over the last thirty years, several nESI and ESI sources capable of controlling spray solution temperature have been developed. These sources can be used to elucidate the thermodynamics of a given analyte, as well as provide structural information that cannot be readily obtained by other, more commonly used techniques.

         <title>On the hydrogen oxalate binding motifs onto dinuclear coinage metal phosphine complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the binding geometries of the isomers that are formed when the hydrogen oxalate ((CO  2  )  2  H = HOx) anion attaches to dinuclear coinage metal phosphine complexes of the form M  1  M  2  dcpm  2  (HOx) with M=Cu, Ag and dcpm = bis(dicyclohexylphosphino)methane, abbreviated [MM]  +  . These structures are established by comparison of isomer&#8208;selective experimental vibrational band patterns displayed by the cryogenically cooled and N  2  &#8208;tagged cations with DFT calculations of the predicted spectra for various local minima. Two isomeric classes are identified that feature either attachment of the carboxylate oxygen atoms to the two metal centers (end&#8208;on docking) or attachment of oxygen atoms on different carbon atoms asymmetrically to the metal ions (side&#8208;on docking). Within each class, there are additional isomeric variations according to the orientation of the OH group. This behavior indicates that HOx undergoes strong and directional coordination to [CuCu]  +  but adopts a more flexible coordination to [AgAg]  +  . Infrared spectra of the bare ions, fragmentation thresholds and ion mobility measurements are reported to explore the behaviors of the complexes at ambient temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Indandione&#8208;terminated quinoidal compounds for low&#8208;bandgap small molecules with strong near&#8208;infrared absorption: effect of conjugation length on the properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low&#8208;bandgap organic semiconductors have attracted much attention for their multiple applications in optoelectronics. However, the realization of narrow bandgap is challenging particularly for small molecules. Herein, we have synthesized four quinoidal compounds, i.e.,  QSN3  ,  QSN4  ,  QSN5  and  QSN6  , with electron rich S,N&#8208;heteroacene as the quinoidal core and indandione as the end&#8208;groups. The optical bandgap of the quinoidal compounds is systematically decreased with the extension of quinoidal skeleton, while maintaining stable closed&#8208;shell ground state.  QSN6  absorbs an intense absorption in the first and second near&#8208;infrared region in the solid state, and has extremely low optical bandgap of 0.74 eV. Cyclic voltammetry analyses reveal that the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the four quinoidal compounds all lie below &#8722;4.1 eV, resulting in good electron&#8208;transporting characteristics in organic thin&#8208;film transistors. These results demonstrated that the combination of &#960;&#8208;extended quinoidal core and end&#8208;groups in quinoidal compounds is an effective strategy for the synthesis of low&#8208;bandgap small molecules with good stability.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Tf  2  O mediated intermolecular / intramolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition between alkynes and nitriles has been developed for efficient construction of polysubstituted pyrimidine and bicyclopyrimidines. In presence of Tf  2  O, aza&#8208;allene species in situ generated through nitrile activation and subsequently participated in the [2+2+2] cycloaddition, which was fully supported by deuteration experiments.

         <title>NMR crystallography reveals carbonate induced Al&#8208;ordering in ZnAl layered double hydroxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) serve a score of applications in catalysis, drug delivery, and environmental remediation. Smarter crystallography, combining X&#8208;ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopy revealed how interplay between carbonate and pH determines the LDH structure and Al ordering in ZnAl LDH. Carbonate intercalated ZnAl LDHs were synthesized at different pH (pH 8.5, pH 10.0, pH 12.5) with a Zn/Al ratio of 2, without subsequent hydrothermal treatment to avoid extensive recrystallisation. In ideal configuration, all Al cations should be part of the LDH and be coordinated with 6 Zn atoms, but NMR revealed two different Al local environments were present in all samples in a ratio dependent on synthesis pH. NMR&#8208;crystallography, integrating NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction, succeeded to identify them as Al residing in the highly ordered crystalline phase, next to Al in disordered material. With increasing synthesis pH, crystallinity increased and the side&#8208;phase fraction decreased. Using  1  H&#8208;  13  C,&#160;  13  C&#8208;  27  Al HETCOR NMR in combination with  27  Al MQMAS,  27  Al&#8208;DQ&#8208;SQ measurements and Rietveld refinement on high&#8208;resolution PXRD data, the extreme anion exchange selectivity of these LDHs for CO  3  2&#8208;  over HCO  3  &#8208;  was linked to strict Al and CO  3  2&#8208;  ordering in the crystalline LDH. Even upon equilibration of the LDH in pure NaHCO  3  solutions, only CO  3  2&#8208;  was adsorbed by the LDH. This reveals the structure directing role of bivalent cations such as CO  3  2&#8208;  during crystallization of [M  2+4  M3+2  (OH)2  ]2+  [A  2&#8211;  ]  1  &#8729;yH  2  O LDH phases.</dc:description>

         <title>Bipyridine&#8208;modified DNA Three&#8208;way Junctions with Amide&#8208;Linkers: Metal&#8208;dependent Structure Induction and Self&#8208;sorting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA three&#8208;way junction (3WJ) structures are essential building blocks for the construction of DNA nanoarchitectures. We have synthesized a bipyridine (bpy)&#8208;modified DNA 3WJ using a newly designed bpy&#8208;modified nucleoside,  U  bpy  &#8208;3  , in which a bpy ligand is tethered via a stable amide&#8208;linker. The thermal stability of the bpy&#8208;modified 3WJ was greatly enhanced by the formation of an interstrand Ni  II  (bpy)  3  complex at the junction core (&#916;  T  m  = +17.7 &#176;C). Although the stereochemistry of the modification site differs from that of the previously reported bpy&#8208;modified nucleoside  U  bpy  &#8208;2  , the degree of the Ni  II  &#8208;mediated stabilization observed with  U  bpy  &#8208;3  was comparable to that of  U  bpy  &#8208;2  . The structure induction of the 3WJs and the duplexes was carried out by the addition or removal of Ni  II  ions. Furthermore, Ni  II  &#8208;mediated self&#8208;sorting of 3WJs was performed using the bpy&#8208;modified strands and their unmodified counterparts. Both transformations were driven by the formation of Ni  II  (bpy)  3  complex. The structural induction and self&#8208;sorting of bpy&#8208;modified 3WJs are expected to have many potential applications in the development of metal&#8208;responsive DNA materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Recognition of Natural and Non&#8208;Natural Substrates by Cellodextrin Phosphorylase from Ruminiclostridium Thermocellum Investigated by NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding the molecular basis of the broad specificity of cellodextrin phosphorylase (CDP) from Ruminiclostridium thermocellum, can facilitate the generation of highly diverse CDP&#8208;catalysed cellulose&#8208;based structures. Here, NMR spectroscopy and molecular modelling allowed to understand how CDP is able to bind non&#8208;natural chemically modified donors and acceptors with different binding epitopes, revealing the structural requirements for CDP ligands, which will enable exploitation of CDP to produce novel materials of high biotechnological interest.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;1&#8594;4&#8208;Glucan polysaccharides like cellulose, derivatives and analogues, are attracting attention due to their unique physicochemical properties, as ideal candidates for many different applications in biotechnology. Access to these polysaccharides with a high level of purity at scale is still challenging, and eco&#8208;friendly alternatives by using enzymes in&#8197;vitro are highly desirable. One prominent candidate enzyme is cellodextrin phosphorylase (CDP) from Ruminiclostridium thermocellum, which is able to yield cellulose oligomers from short cellodextrins and &#945;&#8208;d&#8208;glucose 1&#8208;phosphate (Glc&#8208;1&#8208;P) as substrates. Remarkably, its broad specificity towards donors and acceptors allows the generation of highly diverse cellulose&#8208;based structures to produce novel materials. However, to fully exploit this CDP broad specificity, a detailed understanding of the molecular recognition of substrates by this enzyme in solution is needed. Herein, we provide a detailed investigation of the molecular recognition of ligands by CDP in solution by saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR spectroscopy, tr&#8208;NOESY and protein&#8208;ligand docking. Our results, discussed in the context of previous reaction kinetics data in the literature, allow a better understanding of the structural basis of the broad binding specificity of this biotechnologically relevant enzyme.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Indoline from Achiral Phthalimide Involving Crystallization&#8208;Induced Deracemization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric synthesis was performed by combining a photochemical reaction of an achiral substrate followed by crystallization&#8208;induced deracemization. A fused indoline produced by the photochemical intramolecular &#948;&#8208;hydrogen abstraction and cyclization reaction of N&#8208;(5&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;methylphenyl)phthalimide crystallized as a racemic conglomerate, and crystallization&#8208;induced deracemization by Viedma ripening was performed with an excellent enantioselectivity of 99&#8201;% ee. This is the first example of asymmetric expression and amplification by a photochemical hydrogen abstraction reaction and crystallization&#8208;induced deracemization.







Abstract
Asymmetric synthesis was performed by combining the photochemical reaction of an achiral substrate followed by crystallization&#8208;induced deracemization. The results indicated that a fused indoline produced by photochemical intramolecular &#948;&#8208;hydrogen abstraction and cyclization of N&#8208;(5&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;methylphenyl)phthalimide crystallized as a racemic conglomerate. Since this substrate has an aminal skeleton, racemization involving a ring&#8208;opening and ring&#8208;closing equilibrium process occurred under suitable conditions. Efficient racemization was observed in acetone containing a catalytic base, 1,8&#8208;diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;ene (DBU). Crystallization&#8208;induced dynamic deracemization by Viedma ripening from racemic indoline was performed with an excellent enantioselectivity of 99&#8201;% ee. Furthermore, one&#8208;pot asymmetric synthesis of the indoline was achieved by the photochemical reaction of achiral phthalimide followed by continuous attrition&#8208;enhanced deracemization converging to 99&#8201;% ee of enantiomeric crystals. This is the first example of asymmetric expression and amplification by photochemical hydrogen abstraction and crystallization&#8208;induced dynamic deracemization.

         <title>Switchable Chemoselectivity of Reactive Intermediates Formation and Their Direct Use in A Flow Microreactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switching of chemoselectivity for organolithium reactions between halogen&#8208;lithium exchange reaction with carbolithiation was achieved in a flow microreactor.







Abstract
A chemoselectivity switchable microflow reaction was developed to generate reactive and unstable intermediates. The switchable chemoselectivity of this reaction enables a selection for one of two different intermediates, an aryllithium or a benzyl lithium, at will from the same starting material. Starting from bromo&#8208;substituted styrenes, the aryllithium intermediates were converted to the substituted styrenes, whereas the benzyl lithium intermediates were engaged in an anionic polymerization. These chemoselectivity&#8208;switchable reactions can be integrated to produce polymers that cannot be formed during typical polymerization reactions.

         <title>Polycationic Redox&#8208;Active Cyclophanes with Integrated Electron&#8208;Rich Diboron Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclophanes and macrocyclic cages are of interest for a variety of applications. In this work, it is shown that the integration of electron rich diboron units into polycationic cyclophanes and macrocyclic cages with bi&#8208; and trispyridine electron&#8208;acceptor units leads to novel donor&#8208;acceptor compounds with intriguing optical and redox properties.







Abstract
Cationic cyclophanes are widely used in a variety of applications in supramolecular chemistry and materials science. In this work the authors systematically study the integration of electron&#8208;rich diboron units with BII atoms into polycationic cyclophanes with viologen&#8208;like electron&#8208;acceptor units. They also report a first hexacationic cage&#8208;compound in which three diboron units connect two tris(4&#8208;pyridyl)triazine acceptor units. Moreover, di&#8208; and tetracationic open&#8208;structure compounds, in which one diboron unit connects two bispyridyl groups, were synthesized and the properties compared to those of the corresponding closed structures (cyclophanes). The combination of diboron electron&#8208;donor units and bi&#8208; or oligopyridyl electron&#8208;acceptor units leads to intriguing optical and redox properties.

         <title>GPhos Ligand Enables Production of Chiral N&#8208;Arylamines in a Telescoped Transaminase&#8208;Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig Amination Cascade in the Presence of Excess Amine Donor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral N&#8208;arylamines were accessed by combining transaminases with the Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination (BHA), combining the high enantioselectivity of the former with the efficient arylation ability of palladium. The ligand GPhos was key for the successful arylation of &#945;&#8208;secondary amines in a biphasic water&#8208;toluene system in the presence of excess alanine, achieving overall conversions of up to 89&#8201;% with &gt;99.5&#8201;% ee. No coupling to alanine was observed.







Abstract
The combination of biocatalysis and chemocatalysis can be more powerful than either technique alone. However, combining the two is challenging due to typically very different reaction conditions. Herein, chiral N&#8208;aryl amines, key features of many active pharmaceutical ingredients, are accessed in excellent enantioselectivity (typically&gt;99.5&#8201;% ee) by combining transaminases with the Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination. By employing a bi&#8208;phasic buffer&#8208;toluene system as well as the ligand GPhos, the telescoped cascade proceeded with up to 89&#8201;% overall conversion in the presence of excess alanine. No coupling to alanine was observed.

         <title>Computational Study of Bridge Splitting, Aryl Halide Oxidative Addition to PtII, and Reductive Elimination from PtIV: Route to Pincer&#8208;PtII Reagents with Chemical and Biological Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The precise path to pincers: Density functional theory studies of the bridge splitting of [PtIIR2(SEt2)]2 (R=Me, 4&#8208;tolyl) by bromoarenes containing nitrogen donor groups, and subsequent intramolecular coordination&#8208;assisted oxidative addition, elucidate for R=4&#8208;tolyl the mechanism for formation of mer&#8208;PtII(N,C,N)Br pincers via platinum(IV) intermediates. The pincers are known for their applications in fundamental and applied chemistry.







Abstract
Density functional theory computation indicates that bridge splitting of [PtIIR2(&#956;&#8208;SEt2)]2 proceeds by partial dissociation to form R2Pta(&#956;&#8208;SEt2)PtbR2(SEt2), followed by coordination of N&#8208;donor bromoarenes (L&#8208;Br) at Pta leading to release of PtbR2(SEt2), which reacts with a second molecule of L&#8208;Br, providing two molecules of PtR2(SEt2)(L&#8208;Br&#8208;N). For R=4&#8208;tolyl (Tol), L&#8208;Br=2,6&#8208;(pzCH2)2C6H3Br (pz=pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl) and 2,6&#8208;(Me2NCH2)2C6H3Br, subsequent oxidative addition assisted by intramolecular N&#8208;donor coordination via PtIITol2(L&#8208;N,Br) and reductive elimination from PtIV intermediates gives mer&#8208;PtII(L&#8208;N,C,N)Br and Tol2. The strong &#963;&#8208;donor influence of Tol groups results in subtle differences in oxidative addition mechanisms when compared with related aryl halide oxidative addition to palladium(II) centres. For R=Me and L&#8208;Br=2,6&#8208;(pzCH2)2C6H3Br, a stable PtIV product, fac&#8208;PtIVMe2{2,6&#8208;(pzCH2)2C6H3&#8208;N,C,N)Br is predicted, as reported experimentally, acting as a model for undetected and unstable PtIVTol2{L&#8208;N,C,N}Br undergoing facile Tol2 reductive elimination. The mechanisms reported herein enable the synthesis of PtII pincer reagents with applications in materials and bio&#8208;organometallic chemistry.

For R=4-tolyl (Tol), L-Br=2,6-(pzCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Br (pz=pyrazol-1-yl) and 2,6-(Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Br, subsequent oxidative addition assisted by intramolecular N-donor coordination via Pt&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;Tol&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(L-&lt;i&gt;N,Br&lt;/i&gt;) and reductive elimination from Pt&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; intermediates gives &lt;i&gt;mer&lt;/i&gt;-Pt&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(L-&lt;i&gt;N,C,N&lt;/i&gt;)Br and Tol&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The strong &#963;-donor influence of Tol groups results in subtle differences in oxidative addition mechanisms when compared with related aryl halide oxidative addition to palladium(II) centres.

         <title>Remote Radical Desaturation of Unactivated C&#8722;H Bonds in Amides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed/silver&#8208;promoted desaturation method is described which allows the regioselective conversion of various unactivated N&#8208;alkylamides at remote sites to the corresponding N&#8208;alkenylamides via N&#8208;centred radical mediated 1,5 hydrogen atom transfer, metal&#8208;mediated oxidation and deprotonation. The transformation shows good functional group tolerance and can be used for late&#8208;stage desaturation of drug derivatives and biologically more relevant compounds.







Abstract
Desaturation of inert aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds in alkanes to form the corresponding alkenes is challenging. In this communication, a new and practical strategy for remote site&#8208;selective desaturation of amides via radical chemistry is reported. The readily installed N&#8208;allylsulfonylamide moiety serves as an N radical precursor. Intramolecular 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer from an inert C&#8722;H bond to the N&#8208;radical generates a translocated C&#8208;radical which is subsequently oxidized and deprotonated to give the corresponding alkene. The commercially available methanesulfonyl chloride is used as reagent and a Cu/Ag&#8208;couple as oxidant. The remote desaturation is realized on different types of unactivated sp3&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds. The potential synthetic utility of this method is further demonstrated by the dehydrogenation of natural product derivatives and drugs.

         <title>Cross&#8208;Coupling through Ag(I)/Ag(III) Redox Manifold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Teaching silver to do the trick. Most crucial steps towards oxidative trifluoromethylation via AgI/AgIII redox shuttles are herein deciphered. This innovative cross&#8208;coupling, analogous to the CEL coupling popularized by copper, involves: i) easy AgI/AgIII 2e&#8722; oxidation; ii) phen ligation to AgIII; iii) boron&#8208;to&#8208;AgIII aryl transfer; and iv) benzotrifluoride production from aryl&#8208;AgIII intermediates. Now, AgIIICF3 chemistry is safe and reachable from AgF, KF, CF3TMS and air.







Abstract
In ample variety of transformations, the presence of silver as an additive or co&#8208;catalyst is believed to be innocuous for the efficiency of the operating metal catalyst. Even though Ag additives are required often as coupling partners, oxidants or halide scavengers, its role as a catalytically competent species is widely neglected in cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Most likely, this is due to the erroneously assumed incapacity of Ag to undergo 2e&#8722; redox steps. Definite proof is herein provided for the required elementary steps to accomplish the oxidative trifluoromethylation of arenes through AgI/AgIII redox catalysis (i.&#8201;e. CEL coupling), namely: i) easy AgI/AgIII 2e&#8722; oxidation mediated by air; ii) bpy/phen ligation to AgIII; iii) boron&#8208;to&#8208;AgIII aryl transfer; and iv) ulterior reductive elimination of benzotrifluorides from an [aryl&#8208;AgIII&#8208;CF3] fragment. More precisely, an ultimate entry and full characterization of organosilver(III) compounds [K]+[AgIII(CF3)4]&#8722; (K&#8208;1), [(bpy)AgIII(CF3)3] (2) and [(phen)AgIII(CF3)3] (3), is described. The utility of 3 in cross&#8208;coupling has been showcased unambiguously, and a large variety of arylboron compounds was trifluoromethylated via [AgIII(aryl)(CF3)3]&#8722; intermediates. This work breaks with old stereotypes and misconceptions regarding the inability of Ag to undergo cross&#8208;coupling by itself.

         <title>Regulating Lithium Plating and Stripping by Using Vertically Aligned Graphene/CNT Channels Decorated with ZnO Particles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Li host material that features vertically aligned channels composed of graphene, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and decorated ZnO particles (designated ZnO@G&#8208;CNT&#8208;C) has been prepared by using an ice&#8208;template method through oriented freezing. The Li host material not only suppresses the formation of Li dendrites but also reduces the overpotential of Li nucleation. The usability of ZnO@G&#8208;CNT&#8208;C as Li host was confirmed in full cells with a LiFePO4 cathode.







Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal is regarded as the ultimate anode material for use in Li batteries due to its high theoretical capacity (3860&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1). However, the Li dendrites that are generated during iterative Li plating/stripping cycles cause poor cycling stability and even present safety risks, and thus severely handicap the commercial utility of Li metal anodes. Herein, we describe a graphene and carbon nanotube (CNT)&#8208;based Li host material that features vertically aligned channels with attached ZnO particles (designated ZnO@G&#8208;CNT&#8208;C) and show that the material effectively regulates Li plating and stripping. ZnO@G&#8208;CNT&#8208;C is prepared from an aqueous suspension of Zn(OAc)2, CNTs, and graphene oxide by using ice to template channel growth. ZnO@G&#8208;CNT&#8208;C was found to be mechanically robust and capable of guiding Li deposition on the inner walls of the channels without the formation of Li dendrites. When used as an electrode, the material exhibits relatively low polarization for Li plating, fast Li&#8208;ion diffusion, and high Coulombic efficiency, even over hundreds of Li plating/stripping cycles. Moreover, full cells prepared with ZnO@G&#8208;CNT&#8208;C as Li host and LiFePO4 as cathode exhibit outstanding performance in terms of specific capacity (155.9&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;C), rate performance (91.8&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 4&#8197;C), cycling stability (109.4&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;C after 800 cycles). The methodology described can be readily adapted to enable the use of carbon&#8208;based electrodes with well&#8208;defined channels in a wide range of contemporary applications that pertain to energy storage and delivery.

Stop gap: Donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor organic semiconductors consisting of a highly electron&#8208;deficient naphtho[1,2&#8208;b:5,6&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene&#8208;2,7&#8208;dione quinoidal acceptor and oligothiophene donors show very small optical energy gaps of down to 0.72&#8197;eV in the solid state, due to an efficient intramolecular interaction between the quinoidal acceptor and the aromatic donors that significantly enhances the backbone resonance and reduces the bond length alternation.







Abstract
Organic semiconductors with very small optical energy gaps have attracted a lot of attention for near&#8208;infrared&#8208;active optoelectronic applications. Herein, we present a series of donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8722;A&#8722;D) organic semiconductors consisting of a highly electron&#8208;deficient naphtho[1,2&#8208;b:5,6&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene&#8208;2,7&#8208;dione quinoidal acceptor and oligothiophene donors that show very small optical energy gaps of down to 0.72&#8197;eV in the solid state. Investigation of the physicochemical properties of the D&#8722;A&#8722;D molecules as well as theoretical calculations of their electronic structures revealed an efficient intramolecular interaction between the quinoidal acceptor and the aromatic oligothiophene donors in the D&#8722;A&#8722;D molecules; this significantly enhances the backbone resonance and thus reduces the bond length alternation along the &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbones. Despite the very small optical energy gaps, the D&#8722;A&#8722;D molecules have low&#8208;lying frontier orbital energy levels that give rise to air&#8208;stable ambipolar carrier transport properties with hole and electron mobilities of up to 0.026 and 0.043&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, respectively, in field&#8208;effect transistors.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Azahelicenes and Diaza[8]circulenes through the Intramolecular Scholl Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular Scholl reaction of carbazole derivatives afforded highly strained azahelicenes and azahepta[8]circulene, which was transformed into dibenzodiaza[8]circulenes. The diaza[8]circulene structure was characterized for the first time by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, which revealed the saddle&#8208;shaped &#960;&#8208;conjugated polyaromatics.







Abstract
Carbazole&#8208;based aza[7]helicenes and hetero[9]helicenes were successfully obtained via the intramolecular Scholl reaction of 3,6&#8208;bis(biphenyl&#8208;2&#8208;yl)carbazole congeners, while the reaction of 3,6&#8208;bis(naphthylphenyl)&#8208;appended carbazole gave a triple helicene via an unexpected simultaneous double aryl rearrangement. DFT calculations suggested that the rearrangement proceeded via an arenium cation intermediate. In addition, the reaction of methoxy&#8208;appended substrate gave an azahepta[8]circulene via the concurrent C&#8722;C bond formation. These helical dyes showed circularly polarized luminescence. The azahepta[8]circulene was further transformed into deeply saddle&#8208;distorted dibenzodiaza[8]circulenes as the first example of its solution&#8208;based synthesis and unambiguous structural determination.

         <title>A Benzodiphosphaborolediide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 1,3&#8208;diphosphaborolediide ligand motif, a hitherto missing member of the &#8220;hetero&#8208;Cp&#8220; family, is obtained within an indenyl scaffold as its dilithium salt, as both thf and TMEDA solvates. This dianionic ligand exhibits aromaticity commensurate with its hybrid phospholide&#8208;borolediide nature, as is determined by NICS calculations and observed experimentally for both lithium salts. Additionally, coordination to zero&#8208;valent molybdenum is achieved, demonstrating a capacity to to coordinate readily as a &#960;&#8208; and bridging &#960;&#8208;,&#963;&#8208;type ligand.







Abstract
The first example of a diphosphaborolediide, the benzo&#8208;fused [C6H4P2BPh]2&#8722; (12&#8722;), is prepared from ortho&#8208;bis(phosphino)benzene (C6H4{PH2}) and dichlorophenylborane, via a sequential lithiation approach. The dilithio&#8208;salt can be obtained as an oligomeric THF solvate or discrete TMEDA adduct, both of which are fully characterized, including by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Alongside NICS calculations, data strongly suggest some aromaticity within 12&#8722;, which is further supported by preliminary coordination studies that demonstrate &#951;5&#8208;coordination to a zerovalent molybdenum center, as observed crystallographically for the oligomeric [{Mo(CO)3(&#951;5&#8208;1)}{&#956;&#8208;&#951;1&#8208;Mo(CO)3(TMEDA)}2]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;[&#956;&#8208;Li(THF)][&#956;&#8208;Li(TMEDA)].

         <title>Accessing Extended Fused Isoindolinones Via Sequential Anionic Intramolecular Cyclizations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modelling was used to predict how stereoelectronic effects could be used for regio&#8208;control of 6&#8208;exo versus 7&#8208;endo nucleophilic cyclizations. This stereoelectronic effect was then used synthetically to provide access to fully conjugated and &#960;&#8208;extended isoindolinones.







Abstract
Sequential anionic intramolecular cyclizations and modelling were used for the first time to access unusual fused heterocyclic frameworks in excellent yields. 5&#8208;Exo&#8208;dig cyclizations yielded isoindolinone motifs and a subsequent 6&#8208;exo&#8208; and 7&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization was directed to provide either fused isoquinoline or azepine frameworks. Regioselectivities were controlled by exploiting stereoelectronic effects via nC&#8722;&#8594;&#960;*(Ph) interactions, and modelling studies provided reaction scope.

         <title>Bilayer rGO&#8208;based Photothermal Evaporator for Efficient Solar&#8208;Driven Water Purification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interfacial evaporation has emerged as a promising approach to produce freshwater. However, an urgent concern is that, due to the illegal discharge of industrial wastewater, most water bodies are polluted by trace volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are easily volatilized and enriched in the collected water during the interfacial evaporation process. Herein, a bilayer photothermal evaporator was reasonably designed for contaminated water purification. The bottom hydrophilic rGO&#8208;sodium alginate (SA) sheets purposefully disintegrate water transport channels, thus quickly removing VOCs through physical adsorption. The rGO&#8208;SA&#8208;TiO2 upper layer sufficiently absorbs incident light and therefore persistently generates reactive oxidizing species to degrade upward VOCs. Notably, the oriented microchannels inside the evaporator allow sustained light reflections to improve the utilization of solar energy. The evaporation rate can reach 1.63 kg m&#8208;2 h&#8208;1 with a considerably high VOC removal efficiency of up to 96%. Such an integrated bilayer evaporator provides an effective strategy to obtain clean water via solar distillation.</dc:description>

Such an integrated bilayer evaporator provides an effective strategy to obtain clean water via solar distillation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Failure&#8208;experiment&#8208;supported optimization of poorly reproducible synthetic conditions for novel lanthanide metal&#8208;organic frameworks with two&#8208;dimensional secondary building units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel metal&#8211;organic frameworks containing lanthanide double&#8208;layer&#8208;based secondary building units (KGF&#8208;3) were synthesized using machine learning (ML). Isolating pure KGF&#8208;3 was challenging, and the synthesis was not reproducible because impurity phases were frequently obtained under the same synthetic conditions. Thus, dominant factors for the synthesis of KGF&#8208;3 were identified, and its synthetic conditions were optimized using two ML techniques. Cluster analysis was used to classify the obtained powder X&#8208;ray diffractometry patterns of the products and thus automatically determine whether the experiments were successful. Decision tree analysis was used to visualize the experimental results, after extracting factors that mainly affected the synthetic reproducibility. Water adsorption isotherms revealed that KGF&#8208;3 possesses unique hydrophilic pores. Impedance measurements demonstrated good proton conductivities (  &#963;  = 5.2 &#215; 10  &#8722;4  S cm  &#8722;1  for KGF&#8208;3(Y)) at a high temperature (363 K) and relative humidity of 95% RH.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Ordered molecular self&#8208;assembly of glycoamphiphiles has been regarded as an attractive, practical and bottom&#8208;up approach to obtain stable, structurally well&#8208;defined, and functional mimics of natural polysaccharides. This study describes a versatile and rational design of carbohydrate&#8208;based hydrogelators through  N  ,  N&#8217;  &#8208;substituted barbituric acid&#8208;mediated Knoevenagel condensation onto unprotected carbohydrates in water. Amphiphilic  N  &#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;  C  &#8208;maltosylbarbiturates self&#8208;assembled into pH&#8208; and calcium&#8208;triggered alginate&#8208;like supramolecular hydrogel fibers with a multistimuli responsiveness to temperature, pH and competitive metal chelating agent. In addition, amphiphilic  N  ,  N&#8217;  &#8208;disubstituted &#946;&#8208;  C  &#8208;maltosylbarbiturates formed vesicle gels in pure water that were scarcely observed for glyco&#8208;hydrogelators. Finally, barbituric acid worked as a multitasking group allowing chemoselective ligation onto reducing&#8208;end carbohydrates, structural diversity, stimuli&#8208;sensitiveness, and supramolecular interactions by hydrogen bonding.</dc:description>

         <title>Pincer&#8208;supported gallium complexes for the catalytic hydroboration of aldehydes, ketones and carbon dioxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gallium hydrides stabilised by primary and secondary amines are scarce due to their propensity to eliminate dihydrogen. Consequently, their reactivity has received limited attention. We describe on the synthesis of two novel gallium hydride complexes HGa(THF)[ON(H)O] and H2Ga[&#956;2&#8208;ON(H)O]Ga[ON(H)O] ([ON(H)O]2&#8722; = N,N&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2&#8208;phenoxy)amine) and explore their reactivity towards aldehydes and ketones. These reactions afford alkoxide&#8208;bridged dimers through 1,2&#8208;hydrogallation reactions. The gallium hydrides can be regenerated through Ga&#8722;O/B&#8722;H metathesis from the reaction of such dimers with pinacol borane (HBpin) or 9&#8208;borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (9&#8208;BBN) dimer. These observations allowed us to target the catalytic reduction of carbonyl substrates (aldehydes, ketones and carbon dioxide) with low catalyst loadings at room temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioengineered Protein&#8208;based Adhesives for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein&#8208;based adhesives with their robust adhesion performance and excellent biocompatibility have been extensively explored over years. In particular, the unique adhesion behaviors of mussel and sandcastle worm inspired the development of synthetic adhesives. However, the chemical synthesized adhesives often demonstrate weak underwater adhesion performance and poor biocompatibility/biodegradability, limiting their further biomedical applications. In sharp contrast, genetically engineering endows the protein&#8208;based adhesives the ability to maintain underwater adhesion property as well as biocompatibility/biodegradability. Herein, we outline recent advances in the design and development of protein&#8208;based adhesives by genetic engineering. We summarize the fabrication and adhesion performance of elastin&#8208;like polypeptide&#8208;based adhesives, followed by mussel foot protein (mfp) based adhesives and other sources protein&#8208;based adhesives, such as, spider silk spidroin and suckerin. In addition, the biomedical applications of these bioengineered protein&#8208;based adhesives are presented. Finally, we give a brief summary and perspective on the future development of bioengineered protein&#8208;based adhesives.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Assembly with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Property for Sensing and Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fabrication of new supramolecular materials for real&#8208;time detection of analytes including ions, organic pollutants, gases, biomolecules, and drugs is of pivotal importance in industrial manufacture, clinical treatment, and environmental remediation. Incorporating fluorescent molecules with distinct aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) effects into supramolecular assemblies has received much attention over the past two decades, owing to the remarkable performance of the AIE&#8208;active supramolecular materials in sensing and detection. In this minireview, we summarize the recent progress of superior detection systems on the basis of supramolecular assemblies accompanied with AIE features. We envision that this minireview will be helpful and timely for relevant researchers to stimulate new thinking for constructing new AIE&#8208;based supramolecular materials with advanced architectures for effective sensing and detection.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigation of the Organocatalytic Chlorination of 2&#8208;Phenylpropanal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Results of an examination of the organocatalytic enantioselective &#945;&#8208;chlorination of 2&#8208;phenylpropanal are described. Synthetic investigation including the screening of primary and secondary aminocatalysts, many different reaction conditions, and other &#945;&#8208;branched aldehydes show that especially primary aminocatalysts can catalyze the formation of the &#945;&#8208;chloro branched aldehydes in good yields, but only with moderate enantioselectivities. In order to try to understand the challenge in obtaining high enantioselectivity for the aminocatalytic &#945;&#8208;chlorination of &#945;&#8208;branched aldehydes a series of experimental investigations were performed employing 2&#8208;phenylpropanal as a model system. These investigations have been coupled with computational investigations, which provided important insight into the moderate enantioselectivity of this chlorination reaction. Analysis of the reaction showed, that the lack of control over the selectivity of formation of the (E)&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;enamine intermediate, and the clustering of reaction barriers of possible reaction pathways help to rationalize difficulties in producing high enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal Centers as Nucleophiles: Oxymoron of Halogen Bond&#8208;Involving Crystal Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review highlights recent studies discovering unconventional halogen bonding (HaB) that involves positively charged metal centers. These centers provide their filled d&#8208;orbitals for HaB, and thus behave as nucleophilic components toward the noncovalent interaction. This role of some electron&#8208;rich transition metal centers can be considered an oxymoron in the sense that the metal is, in most cases, formally cationic; consequently, its electron donor function is unexpected. The importance of Ha&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;d&#8208;[M] (Ha = halogen; M is Group 9 (Rh, Ir), 10 (Ni, Pd, Pt), or 11 (Cu, Au)) interactions in crystal engineering is emphasized by showing remarkable examples (reported and uncovered by our processing of the Cambridge Structural Database), where this Ha&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;d&#8208;[M] directional interaction guides the formation of solid supramolecular assemblies of different dimensionalities.</dc:description>

         <title>Abrupt Spin&#8208;State Switching in Mn(III) Complexes with BPh4&#160;Anion: Effect of Halide Substituents on Crystal Structure and Magnetic Properties.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three tetraphenylborates of mononuclear Mn(III) cation complexes with hexadentate ligands, the products of the reaction between a N,N&#162;&#8208;bis(3&#8208;aminopropyl)ethylenediamine and salicylaldehydes with the different haloid substitutions at the 5 or 3,5 positions, have been synthesized: [Mn(5&#8208;F&#8208;sal&#8208;N&#8208;1,5,8,12)]BPh  4  (  1  ), [Mn(3,5&#8208;diCl&#8208;sal&#8208;N&#8208;1,5,8,12)]BPh  4  (  2  ) and [Mn(3,5&#8208;Br,Cl&#8208;sal&#8208;N&#8208;1,5,8,12)]BPh  4  (  3  ). Their crystal structure, dielectric constant (e) and magnetic properties have been studied. Ligand substituents have a dramatic effect on the structure and magnetic properties of the complexes. With decreasing temperature, the complex (  1  ) shows a gradual spin crossover from the high&#8208;spin state (HS) to the HS:LS intermediate phase, followed by an abrupt transition to the low&#8208;spin state (LS) without changing the crystal symmetry. The complexes  2  and  3  are isostructural, but have fundamentally different properties. Complex  2  demonstrates two structural phase transitions related to sharp spin crossovers from the HS to the HS:LS intermediate phase&#160;at 137 K and from the intermediate phase&#160;to the LS at 87 K, while complex  3  exhibits only one spin transition from the HS to the&#160;HS:LS intermediate phase at 83 K.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed multicomponent carbonylation is one of the most efficient strategies to construct carbonyl&#8208;containing compounds. Herein, we developed a palladium&#8208;catalyzed four&#8208;component  per  fluoroalkylation/aminocarbonylation of unactivated alkenes with  perfluoroalkyl halides  , and amines. A wide range of substrates, including anilines, alkylamines, sulfonamides, and hydrazines are all suitable reaction partners for this catalyst system, which resulting various  &#946;  &#8208;perfluoroalkyl amides  with good functional&#8208;group tolerance and excellent chemoselectivity. Furthermore, not only alkyl olefins, but also aliphatic alkynes, and even alkyl allenes can all be employed. Notably, several medical and bio&#8208;active related molecules are compatible here as well.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure and Biosynthesis of Myxofacyclines: Unique Myxobacterial Polyketides Featuring Varying and Rare Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A metabolome&#8208;guided screening approach in the novel myxobacterium  Corallococcus  sp. MCy9072 resulted in the isolation of the unprecedented natural product myxofacycline A featuring a rare isoxazole substructure. Identification and genomic investigation of additional producers alongside targeted gene inactivation experiments and heterologous expression of the corresponding biosynthetic gene cluster in the host  Myxococcus xanthus  DK1622 confirmed a noncanonical megaenzyme complex as the biosynthetic origin of myxofacycline A. Induced expression of the respective genes led to significantly increased production titers enabling the identification of six further members of the myxofacycline natural product family. Whereas myxofacycline A&#8211;D display an isoxazole substructure, myxofacycline E and F intriguingly were found to contain 4&#8208;pyrimidinole, a heterocycle unprecedented in natural products. Lastly, myxofacycline G features another rare 1,2&#8208;dihydropyrol&#8208;3&#8208;one moiety. In addition to the full structure elucidation, we report the underlying biosynthetic machinery and present a rationale for the formation of all myxofacyclines. Unexpectedly, an extraordinary polyketide synthase&#8208;nonribosomal peptide synthetase hybrid was found to produce all three types of heterocycles in these natural products.</dc:description>

         <title>Breaking Symmetry Relaxes Structural and Magnetic Restraints, Suppressing QTM in Enantiopure Butterfly Fe2Dy2 SMMs.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The {Fe  2  Dy  2  } butterfly systems can show Single Molecule Magnet (SMM) behaviour, the nature of which depends on details of the electronic structure, as previously demonstrated for the  [Fe  2  Dy  2  (&#956;  3  &#8208;OH)  2  (Me&#8208;teaH)  2  (O  2  CPh)  6  ]  compound, where the [N,N&#8208;bis&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)&#8208;amino]&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (Me&#8208;teaH  3  ) ligand is usually used in its racemic form. Here we describe the consequences for the SMM properties by using enantiopure versions of this ligand and present here the first homochiral 3d/4f SMM, which could only be obtained for the S enantiomer of the ligand for  [Fe  2  Dy  2  (&#956;  3  &#8208;OH)  2  (Me&#8208;teaH)  2  (O  2  CPh)  6  ]  since the R&#8208;enantiomer underwent significant racemisation. To investigate this further, we prepared the  [Fe  2  Dy  2  (&#956;  3  &#8208;OH)  2  (Me&#8208;teaH)  2  (O  2  CPh)  4  (NO  3  )  2  ]  version, which could be obtained as the  RS  &#8208;,  R  &#8208; and  S  &#8208;compounds. Remarkably, the enantiopure versions show enhanced slow relaxation of magnetisation. The use of the enantiomerically pure ligand suppresses QTM, leading to the conclusion that use of enantiopure ligands is a &#8220;gamechanger&#8221; by breaking the cluster symmetry and altering the intimate details of the coordination cluster&#8217;s molecular structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Contrasting the Mechanism of H2 Activation by Monomeric and Potassium&#8208;Stabilized Dimeric Al(I) Complexes: Do Potassium Atoms Exert any Cooperative Effect?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aluminyl anions are low valent, anionic and carbenoid aluminum species. Various research groups have detected that the potassium atoms play a stabilization role via electrostatic and cation  &#8230;  &#960; interactions with nearby (aromatic)&#8208;carbocyclic rings. In this work, the activation of H  2  utilizing a NON&#8208;xanthene&#8208;Al dimer (  D  ) and monomeric (  M  ) catalysts are studied to reveal the potential role of K  +&#160;  atoms during the activation of this gas.&#160; We aim to reveal whether if  D  is more reactive than  M  (or vice versa), or if complicity between the two monomer units exits within the  D  catalyst . The results suggest that activation energies using the dimeric and monomeric catalysts were found to be very close (around 33 kcal mol  &#8208;1  ). However, a partition of activation energies unveiled that the natures of the energy barriers are inherently different, the former being dominated by a more substantial distortion of the reactants. Interestingly, during the oxidative addition, the distortion of the Al complex is minimal, while H  2  distorts the most, usually over 0.77&#916;E  dist  . Overall, it is found here that electrostatic and induction energies are the main stabilizing components of the interaction energy. The results suggest that the K  +  atoms act as stabilizers of the dimeric structure, and their catalytic role on the reaction mechanism may be negligible, acting as mere spectators in the activation of H  2  . Cooperation between the two monomers in  D  is lacking, and therefore the subsequent activation of H  2  is wholly disengaged.</dc:description>

         <title>Variable Luminescence and Chromaticity of Homoleptic Frameworks of the Lanthanides together with Pyridylpyrazolates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Homoleptic, 3D&#8208;coordination polymers of the formula  3  &#8734;  [Ln(3&#8208;PyPz)  3  ] and  3  &#8734;  [Ln(4&#8208;PyPz)  3  ], (3&#8208;PyPz)&#175;= 3&#8208;(3&#8208;pyridyl)pyrazolate anion, (4&#8208;PyPz)&#175;= 3&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridyl)pyrazolate anion, both C  8  H  6  N  3  &#8208;  , Ln = Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, were obtained as highly luminescent frameworks by reactions of the lanthanide metals (Ln) with the aromatic heterocyclic amine ligands; 3&#8208;PyPzH and 4&#8208;PyPzH. The compounds form two isotypic series of 3D&#8208;coordination polymers and exhibit fair thermal stability up to 360 &#176;C. The luminescence properties of all ten compounds were determined in the solid&#8208;state, with an antenna effect through ligand&#8211;metal energy transfer leading to high efficiency of the luminescence displayed by good quantum yields up to 74%. The emission is mainly based on ion specific lanthanide&#8208;dependent intra 4f&#8211;4f&#8208;transitions for Tb  3+  : green, Dy  3+  : yellow, Sm  3+  : orange&#8208;red, Eu  3+  : red. For the Gd  3+  containing compounds, yellow emission of ligand triplet&#8208;based phosphorescence is observed at room temperature and 77 K. Co&#8208;doping of the Gd&#8208;containing frameworks with Eu  3+  and Tb  3+  allow further shifting of the chromaticity towards white light emission.</dc:description>

         <title>Dehydrogenative Double C&#8212;H Bond Activation in a Germylene&#8208;Rhodium Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal tetrylene complexes offer great opportunities for molecular cooperation due to the ambiphilic character of the group 14 element. Here we focus on the coordination of germylene [(Ar Mes2 ) 2 Ge:] (Ar Mes = C 6 H 3 &#8208;2,6&#8208;(C 6 H 2 &#8208;2,4,6&#8208;Me 3 ) 2 ) to [RhCl(COD)] 2 (COD = 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene), which yields a neutral germyl complex in which the rhodium center exhibits both &#951; 6 &#8208; and &#951; 2 &#8208;coordination to two mesityl rings in an unusual pincer&#8208;type structure. Chloride abstraction from this species triggers a singular dehydrogenative double C&#8212;H bond activation across the Ge/Rh motif. We have isolated and fully characterized three rhodium&#8208;germyl species associated to three C&#8212;H cleavage events along this process. The reaction mechanism has been further investigated by computational means, supporting the key cooperative action of rhodium and germanium centers.</dc:description>
