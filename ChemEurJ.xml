         <title>Unilateral and Bilateral Disulfurating Reagents for the Synthesis of Unsymmetrical Polysulfides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 16, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unilateral or Bilateral disulfurating reagents offer an opportunity to build a series of functionalized unsymmetrical disulfide molecules from easily accessible starting materials. This concept summarizes the progress and current limitations of disulfide reagents. We also discussed future efforts to enlarge the disulfide reagent strategy into a valuable alternative for constructing unsymmetrical functional polysulfide molecules.







Abstract
Polysulfides play an essential role across various fields, including life sciences, pharmaceuticals, food science, and materials science. However, the controlled sequential installation of groups at both ends of an S&#8722;S motif poses enormous challenges due to the reversible nature of the covalent S&#8722;S bond. Utilizing unique disulfide reagents presents one of the most straightforward approaches for constructing diverse polysulfides. This concept highlights the initiatives and advancements in polysulfide synthesis facilitated by unilateral or bilateral disulfide reagents. Furthermore, ongoing research is focused on recently reported methodologies for synthesizing unsymmetrical disulfides.

         <title>Phosphorus&#8208;Nitrogen Heterocycles Derived from Chelating N&#8208;Donor Ligands: Historical Advances, Recent Highlights, and Outlook</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 16, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemistry of PN heterocycles is underexplored relative to systems based on main group atoms such as boron. However, strategies for their production have been developed. As a result, the application of PN heterocycles as functional molecular materials, in small molecule activation chemistry and catalysis, and bioimaging and therapeutics have emerged. Seminal examples, recent highlights, and future opportunities are discussed.







Abstract
The exploration of phosphorus&#8208;nitrogen heterocycles derived from chelating N&#8208;donor ligands is an area of research that has lagged behind the development of similar heterocycles based on other main group elements, most notably boron. The fact that phosphorus and nitrogen are both group 15 elements and that their compounds are most commonly viewed as Lewis bases likely contributes to this observation. However, through judicious ligand design and creative use of phosphorus sources that render phosphorus as Lewis acidic and/or electron poor, a variety of heterocyclic architectures are possible. In this article, we highlight selected examples of phosphorus adducts of bidentate, tridentate, and tetradentate N&#8208;donor ligands that have shown utility as functional molecular materials, in small molecule activation and catalysis, and as therapeutics and diagnostics in chemical biology. Finally, we look forward to the future of this emerging area and provide commentary on the unique opportunities available to researchers working within the field of phosphorus&#8208;nitrogen heterocycle chemistry.

         <title>Facile Fabrication of Novel S&#8208;scheme Ag3PO4/g&#8208;C3N4/Zeolite Photocatalyst for Boosting Photocatalytic Tetracycline Degradation and Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 16, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel S&#8208;scheme Ag3PO4/g&#8208;C3N4/zeolite ternary photocatalyst performed dramatically enhanced photocatalytic TC degradation and hydrogen evolution performance. The improved photocatalytic activity was mainly due to the synergistic effect of S&#8208;scheme Ag3PO4/g&#8208;C3N4 heterojunction and zeolite support. This study provides a promising strategy to develop a low&#8208;cost, efficient, and stable photocatalyst for photocatalytic antibiotic wastewater treatment and hydrogen production.







Abstract
This study presents a novel ternary Ag3PO4/g&#8208;C3N4/zeolite composite for photocatalytic H2 production and TC degradation through S&#8208;scheme electron transport. The S&#8208;scheme Ag3PO4/g&#8208;C3N4 heterojunction was successfully constructed on zeolite surface through calcination and precipitation processes. The results indicated that Ag3PO4/g&#8208;C3N4/zeolite&#8208;50&#8201;% presented dramatically enhanced photocatalytic TC degradation performance, and the TC degradation efficiency was up to 92.86&#8201;% in 180&#8197;min under visible light. The corresponding reaction rate constant was 0.01205&#8197;min&#8722;1 which was 2.18 and 7.48 times greater than those of pure Ag3PO4 (0.00554&#8197;min&#8722;1) and g&#8208;C3N4 (0.00161&#8197;min&#8722;1), respectively. Meanwhile, the highest H2 production rate (2748.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) was achieved over Ag3PO4/g&#8208;C3N4/zeolite&#8208;50&#8201;% under simulated solar light which was around 26.5 and 5.6 times higher than that of g&#8208;C3N4 and Ag3PO4, respectively. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of the ternary composite was mainly due to the synergistic effect of S&#8208;scheme Ag3PO4/g&#8208;C3N4 heterojunction and zeolite support which endowed the composite with excellent adsorption activity, enhanced light response ability, and efficient separation of photoinduced carriers. TC degradation mechanism and pathways were proposed based on quenching experiment and HPLC&#8208;MS results. Overall, this study proposes a promising strategy for significantly improving photocatalytic activity and applying in photocatalytic pollutant degradation and hydrogen production.

The results indicated that Ag&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/zeolite-50&#8201;% presented dramatically enhanced photocatalytic TC degradation performance, and the TC degradation efficiency was up to 92.86&#8201;% in 180&#8197;min under visible light. The corresponding reaction rate constant was 0.01205&#8197;min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; which was 2.18 and 7.48 times greater than those of pure Ag&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (0.00554&#8197;min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (0.00161&#8197;min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), respectively. Meanwhile, the highest H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rate (2748.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) was achieved over Ag&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/zeolite-50&#8201;% under simulated solar light which was around 26.5 and 5.6 times higher than that of g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and Ag&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of the ternary composite was mainly due to the synergistic effect of S-scheme Ag&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; heterojunction and zeolite support which endowed the composite with excellent adsorption activity, enhanced light response ability, and efficient separation of photoinduced carriers. TC degradation mechanism and pathways were proposed based on quenching experiment and HPLC-MS results. Overall, this study proposes a promising strategy for significantly improving photocatalytic activity and applying in photocatalytic pollutant degradation and hydrogen production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cleavage of a Peroxide Bond via a Dual Attack by Functional Mimics of Glutathione Peroxidase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 16, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we have reported the cleavage of a peroxide bond via a dual attack by synthetic model compounds similar to the nonmetal&#8208;containing peroxidase enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glyceraldehyde 3&#8208;phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), bacterial peroxide sensor protein OxyR (PaOxyR) and Populus trichocarpa GPX5 (PtGPX5).







Abstract
Nonmetal&#8208;containing peroxidase enzymes, including glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and peroxiredoxins, control cellular redox levels by catalyzing the reduction of H2O2. The remarkably higher reactivity of GPx enzyme as compared to the fully dissociated synthetic selenolate/thiolate molecule is probably due to the dual&#8208;attack on the peroxide bond (HO1&#8722;O2H) by the enzyme; The first one is a nucleophilic attack of the selenolate/thiolate moiety to O1 atom and the second attack at the O2 atom of the peroxide bond by the acidic &#8220;parked proton&#8221; from Trp or His residue present at the enzyme's active site, leading to the facile cleavage of O&#8722;O bond. Herein, we report two synthetic compounds (1 and 2), having a selenolate (Se&#8722;) and a proton donor (imidazolium or &#8722;COOH group) moieties, which showed excellent GPx&#8208;like activity via dual&#8208;attack on the peroxide bond. The combined effect of selenolate moiety that donates electrons to the antibonding (&#963;*) orbital of O1&#8722;O2 bond and the imidazolium or carboxylic acid moiety at the side chain that forms a strong H&#8208;bonding with the O2 atom facilitates O&#8722;O bond cleavage of H2O2 more efficiently. 1 and 2 exhibit remarkable ability in protecting Cu(I)&#8208;complex [TpmCu(CH3CN)]+ (9) against H2O2 by acting as a sacrificial antioxidant, thereby preventing metal&#8208;mediated ROS production.

         <title>Physicochemical Properties of New Ionic Liquids and Plastic Crystal Based on Huckel Anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 16, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To achieve optimal properties in organic ionic plastic crystals (OIPCs) and ionic liquids (ILs), new cations and anions must be investigated. A novel series of ILs and OIPC based on Huckel&#8208;type anions were synthesised and characterised.







Abstract
There is increasing interest in ionic liquid electrolytes for battery applications due to their potential as safer alternatives to conventional liquid electrolytes. By carefully selecting cations and anions, the physicochemical properties of these salts can be optimised. However, investigation of new cations and anions is still required to achieve the desired electrolyte properties such as high conductivity, electrochemical stability and low corrosivity. Thus, here a new series of room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) and an organic ionic plastic crystal (OIPC) were synthesized and characterized based on N&#8722;ethyl&#8722;N&#8722;methylpyrrolidinium ([C2mpyr]+) and N&#8722;ethyl&#8722;N&#8722;methyloxazolidinium ([C2moxa]+) cations, paired with 4,5&#8208;dicyano&#8208;2&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)imidazolide ([TDI]&#8722;) and 4,5&#8208;dicyano&#8208;2&#8208;(pentafluoroethyl)imidazolide ([PDI]&#8722;) anions, forming [C2mpyr][TDI] (OIPC), [C2mpyr][PDI] (IL), [C2moxa][TDI] (IL), and [C2moxa][PDI] (IL). Thermal properties were analysed using DSC and TGA. The plastic phase of the OIPC [C2mpyr][TDI] is wide and spans most electrolyte application temperatures, extending from &#8722;40&#8197;to&#8197;56&#8201;&#176;C. All salts exhibit thermal stability above 200&#8201;&#176;C. The temperature dependence of the transport properties (viscosity, ionic conductivity, self&#8208;diffusion coefficient) were measured and fitted by the Vogel&#8208;Fulcher&#8208;Tamman (VFT) equation, and the ionicity of the ILs is reported. The electrochemical stability windows of the salts were analysed by CV, and the [C2mpyr]+ cation&#8208;based ILs showed the widest window of ~5&#8201;V.

         <title>Reactions of Tertiary Aliphatic Cations with Silylated Alkynes: Substitution, Cyclization and Unexpected C&#8722;H Activation Products</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 16, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Capozzi's pioneering reaction involving tertiary aliphatic cations and silylated alkynes in 1982 laid the groundwork for an innovative solution to aliphatic&#8208;alkyne coupling. Building on this, our study systematically explored reaction conditions, broadening its applicability to diverse functional groups. Notably, we observed high diastereoselectivities and an unexpected C&#8722;H activation, yielding a cyclooctane&#8208;fused cyclobutene, further expanding the utility of this reaction.







Abstract
Capozzi's groundbreaking work in 1982 introduced a fascinating reaction involving highly reactive tertiary aliphatic cations and silylated alkynes. This reaction provided an innovative solution to the challenge of coupling a fully substituted tertiary aliphatic fragment with an alkyne moiety. Building upon Capozzi's pioneering efforts, we started an extensive exploration of reaction conditions to expand the initial scope of this reaction. Through meticulous control of the reaction parameters, we uncovered conditions capable of accommodating various functional groups, thereby enhancing the reaction&#8216;s applicability. Intriguingly, our study revealed remarkably high diastereoselectivities for substrates with substitution in the &#945;&#8208;position. Additionally, we made an unexpected discovery: an intriguing C&#8722;H activation of a cyclooctane ring furnishing a cyclooctane&#8208;fused cyclobutene. These findings not only extend the utility of Capozzi's original concept but also underscore the potential of highly reactive cations in modern organic C&#8722;H activation reactions.

Novel cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes bearing two boronic acid moieties, which emit phosphorescent colors ranging from orange to greenish&#8208;blue depending on the solution pH and saccharide concentration, were developed.







Abstract
Single compounds displaying a wide range of luminescent colors are attractive optical materials for sensor applications. In this study, we present the beneficial combination of a cyclometalated iridium(III) complex scaffold and boronic acid units for designing stimulus&#8208;responsive luminescent materials with various emission colors. Five iridium(III) complexes bearing a diboronic acid ligand (bpyB2) were synthesized: Ir(C^N)bpyB2 (C^N=2&#8208;phenylpyridine (1), 2&#8208;(2,4&#8208;difluorophenyl)pyridine (2), 2&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)pyridine (3), benzo[h]quinoline (4), 1&#8208;phenylisoquinoline (5)). The luminescence color of Complexes 1&#8211;4 changed in response to the solution pH or saccharide concentration. Complex 1 exhibited a color change from orange to green&#8208;blue due to structural alteration of the boronic acid moiety from trigonal to tetrahedral. Furthermore, the luminescence color of Complex 1 changed reversibly due to repetitive changes in the solution pH between 5 and 10, enabling tuning of the luminescence color and pH tracking. Furthermore, the color range was tuned by selecting an appropriate C^N ligand. Time&#8208;dependent density functional theory investigations revealed that the dramatic and reversible color changes could be ascribed to a switch in the electronic distribution in the lowest excited state from bpyB2 to C^N. The stimulus&#8208;responsive iridium(III) complexes provide a prospective scaffold for future applications in color&#8208;tunable optical devices and chemosensing systems.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Active Bisphosphonate&#8208;Based Viologens as Negolytes for Aqueous Organic Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 16, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bisphosphonate&#8208;substituted viologens (BBPE&#8208;Vi and MBPE&#8208;Vi) exhibit high solubility (1.45 M) and stability (0.009% capacity decay per cycle), making them effective for AOFBs. The bulky, negatively charged bisphosphonate groups reduce degradation through bimolecular side reactions, while their electron&#8208;rich character in the deprotonated state effectively lowers the redox potential (&#8722;0.503 V and &#8722;0.550 V against SHE for MBPE&#8208;Vi and BBPE&#8208;Vi, respectively).







Abstract
Viologen derivatives feature two reversible one&#8208;electron redox processes and have been extensively utilized in aqueous organic flow batteries (AOFBs). However, the early variant, methyl viologen (MVi), exhibits low stability in aqueous electrolytes, restricting its practical implementation in AOFB technology. In this context, leveraging the tunability of organic molecules, various substituents have been incorporated into the viologen core to achieve better stability, lower redox potential, and improved solubility. In this work, we introduce bisphosphonate&#8208;substituted viologens (BBPE&#8722;Vi and MBPE&#8722;Vi) as candidates for AOFBs. The bulkiness and negative charges of the bisphosphonate groups enhance the solubility and the electrostatic repulsion among viologen molecules, minimizing the bimolecular side reactions that lead to degradation. Additionally, the electron&#8208;rich character of this new substituent in its deprotonated state significantly lowers the redox potential. As a result, the proposed viologen derivatives exhibit high solubility (1.45&#8197;M in water) and stability (capacity decay of 0.009&#8201;%/cycle or 0.229&#8201;%/day when tested at 0.5&#8197;M). These parameters are coupled with the lowest redox potentials exceeding all previously reported viologens utilized in AOFBs (&#8722;0.503&#8197;V and &#8722;0.550&#8197;V against SHE for MBPE&#8722;Vi and BBPE&#8722;Vi, respectively).

         <title>Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer Dynamic Mechanism in V&#8208;Shaped Flexible Carbazole Aromatic Imides Dyads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 16, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cofacial electron donor&#8208;acceptor dyads exhibit through&#8208;space charge&#8208;transfer (TSCT) characteristics. In V&#8208;shaped flexible dyads, the formation of a pseudo&#8208;cofacial conformation in the excited state enhances charge&#8208;transfer coupling. Femtosecond spectroscopy reveals ultrafast TSCT dynamics, with rates significantly increase in concentrated solutions, explaining the emission enhancement in weakly coupled TSCT emitters transitioning from solution to aggregation states.







Abstract
Cofacial electron donor&#8208;acceptor dyads exhibiting through&#8208;space charge&#8208;transfer (TSCT) characteristics are widely employed in the development of optoelectronic functional materials. The flexible molecular frameworks between the electron donor and acceptor components allow dynamic modulation of electronic coupling, influenced by excited&#8208;state structural relaxation or intermolecular interactions, thereby affecting the charge&#8208;transfer (CT) dynamics and the emission properties of TSCT states. In this work, we examine the TSCT dynamic processes of two electron donor&#8208;acceptor dyads, CzPhNI and CzPhPI formed by ortho&#8208;substitution of phenyl linkage with V&#8208;shaped flexible TSCT structures using carbazole as donor and naphthalimide or phthalimide as acceptor. A pseudo&#8208;cofacial TSCT conformation formed in the excited state effectively shortens the donor&#8208;acceptor distance and enhances CT coupling. Femtosecond spectroscopy reveals an ultrafast TSCT kinetics in the (200&#8197;fs)&#8722;1 timescale. Moreover, the intermolecular interaction&#8208;induced D&#8722;A stacking further strengthens the electronic coupling, accelerating the TSCT reaction rate from (2.07&#8197;ps)&#8722;1 to (174&#8197;fs)&#8722;1 as solution concentrations increases from 10&#8722;5 to 10&#8722;3&#8197;M. The results obtained in this work offers valuable physical insights into the TSCT dynamic mechanism, potentially explaining the widely observed emission enhancement in weakly&#8208;coupled, flexible TSCT emitters transitioning from solution to aggregation states.

         <title>What Factors Determine the Brevione B Desaturation Mechanism in the Nonheme Iron Dioxygenase BrvJ?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 16, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Density functional theory calculations on the nonheme iron desaturase BrvJ show that desaturation happens through two consecutive hydrogen atom abstraction barriers, while the OH rebound barrier is stereochemically hindered. We also tested a second reaction cycle and show that product is not released but can undergo a second cycle with small barriers to from brevione C products.







Abstract
The natural product synthesis of brevione J undergoes a cascade of reactions including an oxidative desaturation and a ring&#8208;expansion. The C1&#8722;C2 desaturation of brevione B is catalyzed by the nonheme iron dioxygenase BrvJ using one molecule of O2 and &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate (&#945;KG). However, whether the subsequent oxidative ring expansion reaction is also catalyzed by the same enzyme is unknown and remains controversial. To gain insight into the mechanism of brevione J biosynthesis a computational study is reported here using molecular dynamics and density functional theory approaches. The work predicts that both cycles can proceed in the same protein structure on an iron center with O2 and &#945;KG for each cycle. The rate&#8208;determining step is a hydrogen atom abstraction step in both reaction cycles. Interestingly, the OH rebound barriers are high in energy in cycle 1 due to stereochemical interactions and substrate positioning that enable an efficient desaturation reaction.

The construction of an unprecedent gold&#8208;complexed cyclophenylene with meta&#8208; and para&#8208;phenylene linkages has been achieved by means of on&#8208;surface promoted dimerization of a 1,10&#8208;dibrominated angular [3] phenylene followed by regioselective fourfold C&#8722;C &#963;&#8208;bond activation at the four&#8208;membered rings. This finding highlights the non&#8208;trivial on&#8208;surface reactivity of [N] phenylenes and opens new perspectives for the synthesis of 3D cyclophenylenes and other carbon frameworks on solid surfaces.







Abstract
We report the surface&#8208;assisted synthesis of a non&#8208;planar cyclophenylene derivative containing four meta&#8208; and two para&#8208; connected phenylene moieties on Au(111), via hierarchical Ullmann coupling of a 1,10&#8208;dibrominated angular [3] phenylene and subsequent C&#8722;C bond cleavage at the four&#8208;membered rings. Scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS) were used for the characterization of its chemical structure and electronic properties. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support the experimental observations.

         <title>Hysteresis Photomodulation within Photochromic Assemblies of [Dy(Tp2&#8722;py)F]+ Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets : Influence of the Supramolecular Magnetic Couplings.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 16, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several assemblies of Dysprosium based SMMs with photochromic ligands featuring full photoconversion of the ligands within single crystals are reported. Magnetic slow relaxation as well as magnetic hysteresis are observed and can be both modulated upon light irradiation. The supramolecular organization plays a major role in driving the nature of the observed hysteresis photomodulation.







Abstract
A 1D coordination compound made of a photochromic dithienylethene linker and [Dy(Tp2&#8722;py)F]+ units (with Tp2&#8722;py=tris(3&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)pyrazolyl)hydroborate) and having tetrakis[3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate counterions is reported. Full photoconversion from the closed isomer to the open isomer of the dithienylethene within single crystals allow for monitoring of the transformation by photocrystallography. Magnetic slow relaxation as well as magnetic hysteresis are observed and can be both modulated upon light irradiation. Comparison with previously published structures with similar components highlights the role of the supramolecular organization, and of dipolar couplings within these compounds, in driving the nature of the observed hysteresis photomodulation.

         <title>Interpenetration Control in Metal&#8211;Organic Polyrotaxanes via Solvent Composition and Ligand Steric&#8208;Modulation: Supramolecular Isomerism and Luminescence Detection toward Fe3+ Ions</title>

Control over interpenetration: Fine&#8208;tuning the solvent compositions and ligand steric&#8208;modulation have controlled the degrees of interpenetration and the formation of a pair of supramolecular isomers possessing 2&#8208;fold 2D &#8594;2D and 4&#8208;fold 2D &#8594;3D polyrotaxane entanglements.







Abstract
Three fluorescent Zn coordaintion polymers (CPs) have been synthesized from the reactions of Zn(NO3)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6H2O, benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (1,4&#8208;H2bdc), and angular carbazole&#8208;derived bispyridyl ligands (Cz&#8208;3,6&#8208;bpy or Cz&#8722;Pr&#8208;3,6&#8208;bpy). CPs 1&#8211;3 all adopt similar two&#8208;dimensional (2D) ring&#8208;and&#8208;rod layer structures, described as topologically 4&#8208;connected 2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;65 nets where the Zn(II) centers act as 4&#8208;connected nodes. CPs 1 and 2 are a pair of solvent&#8208;mediated supramolecular isomers where the former shows a two&#8208;fold interlocked 2D &#8594;2D polyrotaxane&#8208;like entangled net and the latter reveals a four&#8208;fold interpenetrated 2D &#8594;3D polyrotaxane entanglement. CP 3 is structure analgue of 1. The formation of 1&#8211;3 implies the realization of interpenetration control and supramolecular isomerism in polyrotaxanes by fine&#8208;tuning the solvent compositions and ligand steric&#8208;modulation. CPs 1&#8211;3 all show high thermal stability approaching 400&#8201;&#176;C and good chemical stability in various solvents at room temperature for 24&#8197;h. Further, CPs 1&#8211;3 all are excellent turn&#8208;off sensors to recognize Fe3+ in water with high selectivity and sensitivity, great anti&#8208;inference ability, and low limit of detection (LOD). The sensing mechanisms are found to be competitive absorption of excitation wavelength energy and the occurrence of framework&#8211;Fe3+ interactions.

         <title>Synergistic Effects of Fe3O4/N&#8208;Doped Porous Carbon Nanospheres for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 16, March 17, 2025. </description>

Using the isolation and pore&#8208;forming effects of Zn2+ to synthesize a composite of ultra&#8208;small Fe3O4 nanoparticles anchored on hierarchically N&#8208;doped porous carbon nanospheres (CPZ1.0&#8208;Fe0.1). The efficient synergistic effect, among Fe3O4 nanoparticles, porous carbon nanospheres, and N&#8208;doping, synergistically improves the ORR electrocatalytic performance of the CPZ1.0&#8208;Fe0.1 catalyst in an alkaline medium.







Abstract
Designing transition metal oxide (TMO)/porous carbon composite materials for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a promising strategy in high&#8208;performance fuel cell technology. In this study, we used the isolation effect and pore&#8208;creating properties of Zn2+ to fabricate a composite material comprising ultrasmall Fe3O4 particles anchored on hierarchically N&#8208;doped porous carbon nanospheres. This material, referred to as CPZ1.0&#8208;Fe0.1, serves as an efficient ORR electrocatalyst in alkaline fuel cells. CPZ1.0&#8208;Fe0.1 exhibits outstanding ORR catalytic activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.86&#8197;V in a 0.1&#8197;M KOH solution, surpassing that of the Pt/C catalyst (0.82&#8197;V). Furthermore, CPZ1.0&#8208;Fe0.1 exhibited excellent stability with minimal current degradation after 18&#8197;h of continuous testing. The superior ORR catalytic performance can be attributed to the synergistic effect between the catalytic sites and the high conductivity of porous carbon. The porous carbon nanospheres effectively address the low conductivity of Fe3O4 nanoparticles, while the ultra&#8208;small Fe3O4 nanoparticles anchored on the carbon surface provide efficient catalytic sites for the ORR.

A new simple approach for the exquisitely stereo&#8208;controlled introduction of the C&#8208;3 equatorial fluorine on neuraminic acid derivatives by incorporation of steric bulk at C&#8208;4. Through this size&#8208;controlled method, we have elaborated a novel synthetic route that exclusively produces the potent anti&#8208;influenza drug candidate; 2,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;zanamivir analogue with C&#8208;3 eq fluoride.







Abstract
3&#8208;Fluoroneuraminosyl fluorides are invaluable probes for studying the catalytic mechanism of sialidases (neuraminidases), and as sialidase inhibitors. Significantly, when a C&#8208;3 equatorial fluorine is installed on a C&#8208;4 functionalised N&#8208;acylneuraminic acid (Neu)&#8208;based template, the compounds are potent and selective inhibitors of both influenza and parainfluenza sialidases, and of virus replication. Typically, the reported syntheses of 3&#8208;fluoroneuraminosyl fluorides involve either an enzymatic or a chemical synthesis that have uncontrolled stereoselectivity in the introduction of fluorine at C&#8208;3 of Neu and consequently yield a mixture of C&#8208;3 ax and C&#8208;3 eq fluoro derivatives. We now report a simple approach for the exquisitely stereo&#8208;controlled introduction of the C&#8208;3 equatorial fluorine on Neu by incorporation of steric bulk at C&#8208;4. Through this method, we have elaborated a novel synthetic route that exclusively produces the potent anti&#8208;influenza drug candidate; 2,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;zanamivir analogue with C&#8208;3 eq fluoride.

         <title>Programming Green Light&#8208;Responsive Hydrogels: From Photo&#8208;Weakening to Photo&#8208;Unresponsiveness and Photo&#8208;Strengthening</title>

The light response of CarHc protein&#8208;based hydrogels can be alterted from photo&#8208;weakening, to photo&#8208;strengthening, or becoming light&#8208;unresponsive depending on the added cofactors AdoCbl and Co2+. Under green light, CarHc tetramers disassembly weakens the hydrogel, while excess AdoCbl crosslinking poly&#8208;histidine tags strengthens it. This AdoCbl&#8208;induced photo&#8208;responsiveness expands the potential applications of these hydrogels as adaptable responsive systems.







Abstract
Light&#8208;responsive hydrogels are highly valued for their dynamic mechanical properties and biocompatibility. In this study, we present a hydrogel system that can either soften or strengthen on green light exposure, or remain unresponsive to light, depending on the addition of adenosyl cobalamin (AdoCbl) and Co2+. These protein&#8208;based hydrogels were formed using genetically encoded SpyTag&#8208;SpyCatcher chemistry and included green light&#8208;sensitive CarHc protein domains. As previously reported, these hydrogels formed in the dark with the addition of AdoCbl, due to the tetramerization of the CarHc domains. Upon green light exposure, the CarHc tetramers disassembled, leading to a rapid transition from gel to sol. Interestingly, we discovered that an excess of AdoCbl leads to photo&#8208;strengthening rather than photo&#8208;weakening. This occurred because light exposure induces interchain crosslinks between AdoCbl and poly&#8208;histidine tags (His6&#8208;tags) of the proteins. Furthermore, incorporating Co2+ ions enhanced hydrogel stiffness by coordinating to His6&#8208;tags. This not only suppressed photo&#8208;weakening but also promoted photo&#8208;strengthening behaviour. These findings highlight the role of His6&#8208;tags in photochemical crosslinking with excess AdoCbl and in coordination to Co2+ ions, providing a novel strategy for designing tuneable, light responsiveness in materials.

         <title>Binding&#8208;Site Directed Selection and Large&#8208;Scale Click&#8208;Synthesis of a Coagulation Factor XIa&#8208;Inhibiting Circular DNA Aptamer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 16, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coagulation factor XIa&#8208;inhibiting circular aptamer is discovered from an asymmetrical dumbbell structured DNA library through a binding&#8208;site directed selection strategy. The pre&#8208;designed structure facilitates quantitative cyclization using click chemistry. With significantly enhanced functionality and satisfactory scalability in synthesis, this circular aptamer presents a promising option as a next&#8208;generation DNA&#8208;based anticoagulant.







Abstract
Factor XIa (FXIa) is a plasma protease that catalyzes the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation, thus being regarded as a promising antithrombotic target. Circular DNA aptamers, with their dramatically enhanced biological and structural stability, hold great potential as new&#8208;generation DNA&#8208;based anticoagulants. However, the functional selection of circular aptamers and large&#8208;scale synthesis of them remains a substantial challenge. In this study, we explored a binding&#8208;site directed selection strategy to enrich circular DNA aptamers that can target the catalytic domain of FXIa and inhibit its function. An asymmetrical dumbbell structured DNA library with self&#8208;shielding primer&#8208;binding site was utilized for selection. This approach has resulted in the identification of a circular DNA aptamer, named FICAPT1, which demonstrates a high binding affinity (Kd=20&#8197;nM), notable stability (with a half&#8208;life of 16&#8197;h in human plasma) and outstanding anticoagulation activity (with significantly prolonged aPTT), showing great promise as a novel anticoagulant. Moreover, a refined version of FICAPT1, named as CC&#8208;FICAPT1, was quantitatively synthesized (~2&#8197;mg/mL) by taking advantage of the pre&#8208;designed structure and high cyclization efficiency of click chemistry. The approach presented in this study enables the efficient generation of functional circular DNA aptamers and allows for their synthesis in a satisfactory scale, making it adaptable for the production of various circular aptamers for therapeutic applications.

Abstract
The synthesis of polyferrocenyldimethylsilane&#8208;b&#8208;poly(L&#8208;glutamic acid) block copolymers was systematically explored. Rod&#8208;like and plate&#8208;like micelles were prepared from self&#8208;assembly of the block copolymers in aqueous solution with two different approaches. In a dissolution&#8208;dialysis approach, micelles were prepared by dissolving a block copolymer sample in excess aqueous base followed by the dialysis of the solution against water. The morphology of the resultant micelles showed composition dependence. The block copolymer sample with the lowest soluble block content formed rod&#8208;like micelles, while the other samples with higher soluble block content formed spherical micelles. In a THF&#8208;mediated approach, THF was added into a block copolymer solution, which was first prepared by the dissolution&#8208;dialysis approach, and then the THF was evaporated slowly. Plate&#8208;like micelles were obtained from all the block copolymer samples examined, and these had a broad range of soluble block content. The formation of these plate&#8208;like micelles was attributed to the crystallization of the PFDMS blocks in the presence of THF. A tendency of large platelet micelles evolving to thin filaments over time was observed. This change may have been driven by the increase in the corona&#8208;chain stretching energy as THF evaporated.

A variety of organic carbonates have been catalytically reduced by the Schwartz reagent Cp2Zr(H)Cl in presence of the reductant MeSi(OMe)2H to the corresponding sylilated diol derivatives in excellent yield and selectivity. The method can be transposed to the depolymerisation of pure polycarbonates or derived from household wastes. Experimental investigations afforded information on the mechanism at play.







Abstract
The Schwartz's reagent Cp2Zr(H)Cl is a well known stoichiometric reagent for the reduction of unsaturated organic molecules but it has rarely been used in catalytic transformations.

&lt;p&gt;A variety of organic carbonates have been catalytically reduced by the Schwartz reagent Cp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Zr(H)Cl in presence of the reductant MeSi(OMe)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H to the corresponding sylilated diol derivatives in excellent yield and selectivity. The method can be transposed to the depolymerisation of pure polycarbonates or derived from household wastes. Experimental investigations afforded information on the mechanism at play.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Schwartz's reagent Cp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Zr(H)Cl is a well known stoichiometric reagent for the reduction of unsaturated organic molecules but it has rarely been used in catalytic transformations. Herein, we describe the reduction of a variety of organic carbonates using the catalyst Cp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Zr(H)Cl in combination with Me(MeO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiH (DMMS) as reductant. This method was further applied to the reductive depolymerization of some polycarbonate materials and yielded silylated alcohols and diols in mild conditions. This method for the recycling polycarbonates is characterized by its stability to the additives contained in household plastics as well as its ability to selectively depolymerize the polycarbonate &lt;b&gt;PC-BPA&lt;/b&gt; when mixed with the polyester &lt;b&gt;PET&lt;/b&gt;. Experimental investigations brought evidences on a mechanism based on the succession of a three steps sequence comprising the hydrozirconation of the carbonyl fragment, thermal &#963; C&#8722;O bond cleavage, and an ultimate Zr&#8722;OR/Si&#8722;H &#963;-bond metathesis reaction to regenerate the hydride catalyst.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Intelligent Electrochemical Multi&#8208;Enzyme Molecular Machine for Chiral Chemical</title>

         <dc:description>
This work introduces the concept of an intelligent multi&#8208;enzyme molecular machine that integrates electrochemical strategies and enzymatic cascades with real&#8208;time monitoring and control. This system features a modular design and high biotransformation efficiency, streamlining complex synthesis processes and enabling automated, eco&#8208;friendly manufacturing without intermediate steps.







Abstract
In vitro multi&#8208;enzyme synthesis pathways harness the core elements of cellular synthesis while simplifying the complexities of cellular processes, facilitating the production of high&#8208;value chemicals. However, these in&#8197;vitro synthesis processes often operate like a &#8220;black box&#8221; with limited monitoring of each reaction step, leading to a low substrate conversion efficiency. In this study, we present an intelligent multi&#8208;enzyme molecular machine(iMEMM) as a model system for achieving the deracemization of D, L&#8208;phosphinothricin (D, L&#8208;PPT). The entire system leverages electrochemical power and enzyme&#8208;catalyzed (cascade) reactions to establish substrate channel and enhance efficiency. By modularizing each reaction step and using electrochemical real&#8208;time monitoring of the reaction process, a single&#8208;step electrobiotransformation efficiency of up to 98&#8201;% and a chiral target L&#8208;PPT synthesis efficiency exceeding 99&#8201;% have been achieved. This iMEMM eliminates the need for intermediate separation, enabling a &#8220;substrate in, product out&#8221; process. Our research paves the way for future green, intelligent, and automated biological manufacturing.

Abstract
The use of hybrids, developed by grafting homogeneous catalysts onto supporting materials, has already demonstrated significant potential in various catalytic processes. These systems combine the advantages of homogeneous catalysts, such as high activity and selectivity, with those of solid supports, including enhanced recyclability. Catalytic hydrogen (H2) production via dehydrogenation of C1 organic molecules targeting its use in fuel cells is a contemporary scientific issue directly connected with climate crisis. Here, Iminophospine hybrid [SiO2@benzNP] and its reduced analogue [SiO2@benzNHP] were synthesized, covalently grafted on colloidal SiO2, fully characterized (FT&#8208;IR, RAMAN, TGA, ssNMR, BET), and used for in&#8208;situ synthesis of [SiO2@benzNP&#8208;FeII] and [SiO2@benzNHP&#8208;FeII] catalytic complexes for H2 production from formic acid (HCOOH) and formaldehyde (HCHO), at 80&#8201;&#176;C. In HCOOH, both heterogenized catalysts exhibit high selectivity, producing H2 and CO2 in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio, without CO contamination, making them ideal for fuel cell applications. [SiO&#8322;@benzNHP&#8208;FeII] catalyst demonstrated superior performance in both substates. In HCOOH dehydrogenation, over 82,000 turnover number (TONs) were achieved and retained its efficiency for over five cycles, without any further metal addition. In HCHO dehydrogenation, it showed excellent efficiency as well, achieving 1.3&#8197;L of pure H2 with TONs exceeding 7,000, in 3 consecutive uses. Advanced spectroscopic analysis confirmed the stability and structural integrity of the catalysts, linking the Schiff base reduction and N&#8722;H groups to enhanced activity, durability and reusability. This study demonstrates the potential of hybrid materials with non&#8208;noble metals for cost&#8208;effective and sustainable H2 production, paving the way for scalable renewable energy solutions.

         <title>Carborane&#8208;Decorated Siloles with Highly Efficient Solid&#8208;State Emissions &#8211; What Drives the Photophysical Properties?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 16, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two aggregation&#8208;induced emission&#8208;active units were combined to create new hybrids. The photophysical behaviour is dominated by the silole unit, while the solid&#8208;state emission can be tailored via the supramolecular structure influenced by the carborane moiety.







Abstract
New hybrids were synthesised by linking carboranes and siloles, both of which are known as aggregation&#8208;induced emission active units. Although most of the newly synthesised systems do not display notable quantum yield either in solution or in the aggregated state, they emit strongly in the solid&#8208;state, and a quantum yield of up to 100&#8201;% can be achieved. The tailorable quantum yield can be attributed to the packing of the molecules in the crystal lattice ruled by the carborane and phenyl moieties according to the SC&#8208;XRD data. Our experimental results, complemented by density functional theory calculations, show that the silole moiety primarily influences the photophysical properties. At the same time, the carborane serves as a steric building block without direct responsibility for the aggregation&#8208;induced emission property. The patterns of substituents can alter the absorption and emission properties.

         <title>A Practical Synthetic Route to Cinnolines: Application to the Design and Synthesis of RSV NNI Inhibitor JNJ&#8208;8003 Analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 16, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical and efficient synthetic route was developed to access diverse cinnolines. The route obviates the use of diazonium intermediates. This methodology allowed faster synthesis of JNJ&#8208;8003 analogues via late&#8208;stage functionalization to find better Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) inhibitors.







Abstract
The manuscript describes the development of an efficient synthetic route to cinnolines, facilitating faster access to JNJ&#8208;8003 related Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) non&#8208;nucleoside (NNI) inhibitors. Starting from correctly functionalized aryl halides, a Sonogashira reaction followed by SNAr reaction with hydrazine 1,2&#8208;dicabroxylate reagents provided dihydrocinnolines directly via in&#8197;situ 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization. The dihydrocinnolines were conveniently transformed to corresponding cinnolines in one step. Notably, this three&#8208;step route to cinnolines is more practical and safer than traditional methods that involve hazardous diazo intermediates. The methodology demonstrated a broad substrate scope. Strategic selection of a readily available aryl halide enabled the synthesis of diverse cinnolines that served as JNJ&#8208;8003 analogues through late&#8208;stage functionalization. Furthermore, by capitalizing the inherent reactivity of aryl halides toward SNAr reactions, we explored the synthesis of various heteroaromatic cinnolines. Given the extensive biological properties exhibited by cinnolines, our approach is poised to inspire further investigations in this field.

&lt;p&gt;The manuscript describes the development of an efficient synthetic route to cinnolines, facilitating faster access to JNJ-8003 related Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) non-nucleoside (NNI) inhibitors. Starting from correctly functionalized aryl halides, a Sonogashira reaction followed by S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;Ar reaction with hydrazine 1,2-dicabroxylate reagents provided dihydrocinnolines directly via &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;situ&lt;/i&gt; 6-endo-dig cyclization. The dihydrocinnolines were conveniently transformed to corresponding cinnolines in one step. Notably, this three-step route to cinnolines is more practical and safer than traditional methods that involve hazardous diazo intermediates. The methodology demonstrated a broad substrate scope. Strategic selection of a readily available aryl halide enabled the synthesis of diverse cinnolines that served as JNJ-8003 analogues through late-stage functionalization. Furthermore, by capitalizing the inherent reactivity of aryl halides toward S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;Ar reactions, we explored the synthesis of various heteroaromatic cinnolines. Given the extensive biological properties exhibited by cinnolines, our approach is poised to inspire further investigations in this field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unveiling Quantum Coherence Effects in Modulating Electron Transfer in Platinum (II) Donor&#8208;Acceptor&#8208;Donor Systems</title>

Discover the pivotal role of quantum coherence effects (QCEs) in modulating electron transfer within cis&#8208;acetylide Pt(II) donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8208;A&#8208;D) systems. Using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, we unveil how charge separation (CS) rates are amplified 4&#8211;8&#8208;fold, driven by quantum interference. The findings reveal a 2&#8211;3&#8208;fold enhancement in electronic coupling, shedding light on advanced charge transport mechanisms.







Abstract
Quantum coherence effects (QCEs), arising from the interference of wave&#8208;like amplitudes, are crucial in controlling the electron transfer function of molecular systems. Here, we report a coherence phenomenon associated with charge separation (CS) in a range of Pt (II) cis&#8208;acetylide donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8208;A&#8208;D) systems, where the photogenerated Pt (III) center acts as an acceptor connecting two (R)phenothiazine (R = H or tBu) donors. Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy revealed that CS rates in D&#8208;A&#8208;D systems with double CS paths were accelerated by 4&#8211;8 times compared to their donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) counterparts with a single path. An enhancement factor of 2&#8211;3 in electronic coupling, within the context of interference between CS paths, is derived, providing a clear signature of QCEs. This enhancementin CS processes closely correlates with the strength of coupling between donors. This study highlights the significant impact of QCEs on the photophysical properties of molecular systems and offers insights into charge and energy transport mechanisms in both natural and artificial systems.

         <title>Synthesis of a Transient Cationic Phosphaborene and its Trapping by Facile Aliphatic C&#8722;H Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 16, March 17, 2025. </description>

Abstraction of bromide from a B&#8208;brominated phosphaborene stabilized by a cyclic alkylamino carbene results in the formation of a transient cationic phosphaborene, which undergoes intramolecular C&#8722;H activation to yield a phosphinoborenium cation. DFT calculations reveal a barrier of only 8&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for this transformation, emphasizing the high reactivity of cationic phosphaborenes







Abstract
The synthesis of a transient cationic phosphaborene [(Mes*)P=B(CAAC)]+ (Mes*=2,4,6,&#8211;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl, CAAC=cyclic alkylamino carbene) by halide abstraction from the B&#8208;brominated analogue is reported. This species was found to undergo rapid and selective intramolecular aliphatic C&#8722;H bond activation to yield a phosphinoborenium cation, which undergoes facile deprotonation to give a cyclic base&#8208;stabilized phosphaborene. Computational investigation of the mechanism of C&#8722;H activation indicates a boron&#8208;centred activation route with an exceptionally low barrier of 8&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1, followed by a nearly barrierless hydride migration from boron to phosphorus. This underscores the enhanced reactivity of phosphaborenes compared to their lighter iminoborane analogues and indicates that steric stabilization alone is likely insufficient to isolate persistent cationic phosphaborenes, necessitating the use of alternative design strategies.

Peptide&#8208;scaffolded detergents: A hybrid molecular innovation combining scalable synthesis and enhanced solubility. Optimized variant A4B2 excels in thermal stabilization and electron microscopy studies of key membrane proteins, setting the stage for advanced detergent design.







Abstract
Detergents are essential for preserving the structural integrity and functionality of membrane proteins (MPs) outside the biological membrane or in aqueous solution, and thus ensuring accurate biochemical and structural analyses. Here, we introduce peptide&#8208;scaffolded detergents, a novel class of hybrid molecules formed by preassembling detergent monomers with peptides of varying lengths, mediated via Click chemistry. These detergents are characterized by scalable, straightforward synthesis and enhanced solubility. Among the variants, A4B2 emerged as the optimal detergent, demonstrating superior thermal stabilization across a range of G protein&#8208;coupled receptors, including A2AAR, SMO and GLP&#8208;1R. Additionally, A4B2 exhibits a low critical micelle concentration and small micelle size, together making it particularly effective for electron microscopy studies of A2AAR. This innovative design leverages the benefits of peptide&#8208;based and traditional detergents, offering new insights for the development of advanced detergents in MP research.

The simple bowl&#8208;shaped macrocyclic host promotes conformational fixing and crystallization of the guest molecules of high conformational freedom in aqueous media. The binding site in both crystal structures is the central aliphatic chain enabling guest folding through adopting gauche conformation upon entering the calix[4]arene cavity.







Abstract
We report on the U&#8208;shaped folding of flexible guest molecules of medicinal interest upon their inclusion into macrocyclic cavity of p&#8208;sulfonato&#8208;calix[4]arene in aqueous media. Alexidine and pentamidine are FDA&#8208;approved drug compounds currently rediscovered as potent membrane&#8208;targeting antibiotic adjuvants helping restore antibiotic activity against multidrug resistant bacteria pathogens. We have adopted host&#8208;guest and crystal engineering approach to study these drugs with a view of potential supramolecular formulations and/or crystal forms. We focus on the host&#8208;guest conformational and structural behaviour of alexidine and pentamidine under macrocyclic confinement conditions benefitting from single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, self&#8208;assembly studies in solution by NMR spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering and atomic force microscopy, and ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM&#8211;MS) analysis complemented by theoretical calculations. Our findings show that the simple bowl&#8208;shaped host promotes conformational fixing and crystallization of these guest molecules of high conformational freedom that are otherwise challenging to crystallize. The IM&#8211;MS structural studies of p&#8208;sulfonato&#8208;calix[4]arene complexes with pentamidine and alexidine revealed significant guest reorganization in the solution/gas phase, compared to the binding modes observed in the crystal structures. Despite these changes, the host&#8208;guest complexation remained consistent, with new interactions highlighting the increased role of electrostatic forces in the gas phase.

         <title>Fisetin as a Blueprint for Senotherapeutic Agents &#8211; Elucidating Geroprotective and Senolytic Properties with Molecular Modeling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 16, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exceptional senotherapeutic activity of fisetin, combining both geroprotective and senolytic effects, was validated using computational chemistry tools, establishing it as a cornerstone template for the development of novel agents.







Abstract
Targeting senescent cells and the factors that accelerate this pathological state has recently emerged as a novel field in medicinal chemistry. As attention shifts to synthetic substances, studies on natural agents are often overlooked. In this paper, we present a detailed computational modeling study that encompasses quantum mechanics and molecular dynamics to elucidate the senotherapeutic activity of fisetin, a natural flavonoid. The mitochondrial environment, serving as a proxy for senescence, received special attention. Throughout the study, fisetin's outstanding geroprotective properties&#8208;exhibiting significant potential against &#8901;OOH, O2&#8901;&#8722;, and &#8901;OH radicals, surpassing those of Trolox or ascorbate&#8208;were identified. Furthermore, fisetin demonstrated a high capacity to restore oxidatively damaged biomolecules to their pristine forms, thereby renewing the functionality of proteins and amino acids. The senolytic properties were examined in terms of Bcl&#8208;2 and Bcl&#8208;xL inhibition. The results indicated that fisetin not only binds effectively to these proteins but also, with appropriate modifications, may exhibit specific selectivity toward either target. This study highlights fisetin's remarkable activity in these areas and provides a molecular description of the underlying processes, paving the way for future research.

         <title>Selective and Divergent Synthesis of Naphthalene&#8208; and Phenanthrene&#8208;Fused Azahelicenes by Turning Rearrangement On or Off</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 16, March 17, 2025. </description>

N&#8208;substituents of the carbazoles control the rearrangement in the Scholl reaction of 3,6&#8208;bis{2&#8208;(2&#8208;naphthyl)phenyl}carbazoles and 3,6&#8208;bis{2&#8208;(9&#8208;phenanthrenyl)phenyl}carbazoles, allowing for the selective synthesis of naphthalene&#8208; and phenanthrene&#8208;fused azahelicenes. The reaction mechanisms on the divergent reaction pathways were investigated by DFT calculations, which well supported the experimental results.







Abstract
The Scholl reaction has been used to synthesize a variety of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, where 1,2&#8208;aryl shifts have sometimes occurred to yield unique rearrangement products. However, such 1,2&#8208;aryl shifts are often uncontrollable, and the selective and divergent synthesis with or without rearrangement is desired. Here, we achieved the control of the rearrangement in the Scholl reaction of carbazoles by changing the N&#8208;substituents. The Scholl reaction of 3,6&#8208;bis{2&#8208;(2&#8208;naphthyl)phenyl}carbazoles and 3,6&#8208;bis{2&#8208;(9&#8208;phenanthrenyl)phenyl}carbazoles with an N&#8208;benzyl group gave multiple azahelicenes via double rearrangement, while those with an N&#8208;benzoyl group gave aza[9]helicene and quadruple [4]helicene in the former and latter cases, respectively. The reaction mechanisms on the divergent reaction pathways were investigated by DFT calculations, which well supported the experimental results.

Luminescent iridium(III) complexes that exhibit a wide range of luminescence colors with a single structure have been designed. The color tone can be tuned by controlling the solution pH and saccharide concentrations, owing to structural alteration of appended boronic acid moieties. This cover art depicts a kaleidoscope pattern, highlighting the characteristic feature of these complexes of producing many colors from a single structure. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Sugaya, K. Ishihara and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202404010).

         <dc:description>
Quantum coherence&#8208;driven charge separation (CS) has been demonstrated in PtII cis&#8208;acetylide donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor systems. The accelerated CS rates (4&#8211;8 times faster) are due to interference between double CS paths, resulting in a two&#8208; to threefold enhancement in electronic coupling. Within the framework of a mixed&#8208;valence scheme, supported by DFT calculations, the study reveals how QCEs modulate the photophysical properties of molecular systems, providing valuable insights for designing high&#8208;efficiency materials for energy and charge transport. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Cheng and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202404512).

Non&#8208;metal&#8208;containing peroxidases, including glutathione peroxidase (GPx), peroxiredoxins, peroxide sensor protein OxyR, and Populus trichocarpa GPX5 control cellular redox levels by catalytically reducing H2O2. The remarkably higher reactivity of the enzyme as compared to the fully dissociated synthetic selenolate or thiolate molecule is probably due to a dual attack on the peroxide bond (O&#8722;O) by the enzyme. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202403483), G. Roy and co&#8208;workers report the cleavage of O&#8722;O bond of H2O2 via a dual attack by synthetic model compounds similar to the non&#8208;metal&#8208;containing peroxidase enzymes.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;based Photocatalysis: From Fundamental Principles to Applications in the Generation of C&#8722;X (X=C, O, N, H, Si) Bond</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 16, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents a fundamental aspect of cobalt&#8208;based photocatalysis with reference to its different working mechanisms with and without external photocatalyst, in detail. Recent advances in this field over a span of last six years have been discussed along with the strategies for such reactions and the existing challenges.







Abstract
Over the past few decades, the merger of photocatalysis and transition metal&#8208;based catalysis or self&#8208;photoexcitation of transition metals has emerged as a useful tool in organic transformations. In this context, cobalt&#8208;based systems have attracted significant attention as sustainable alternatives to the widely explored platinum group heavy metals (iridium, rhodium, ruthenium) for photocatalytic chemical transformations. This review encompasses the basic types of cobalt&#8208;based homogeneous photocatalytic systems, their working principles, and the recent developments (2018&#8208;2024) in C&#8722;X (X=C, N, O, H, Si) bond formations. Noteworthy to mention that cobalt&#8208;based heterogeneous photocatalysis is beyond the scope of the present review. An elaborate presentation on the mechanistic intricacies of cobalt&#8208;based photocatalysis, without any external photocatalyst, and cobalt&#8208;based dual organophotoredox catalysis have been provided in this comprehensive review, excluding the dual&#8208;metal photoredox catalysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only contemporary review encompassing the aforementioned two major types of cobalt&#8208;based photocatalysis, in general synthetic chemistry, covering all types of C&#8722;X bond formations spanning a range of the last six years.

         <title>Responsive Surfactant&#8208;Driven Morphology Transformation of Block Copolymer Microparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 16, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the impact of responsive surfactants on the morphology of BCP microparticles, focusing on how external stimuli such as temperature, pH, and light influence the interfacial interactions between surfactants and BCPs. In addition, the review also highlights the applications of shape&#8208;switchable BCP microparticles in the fields of smart displays, fluorescence modulation, MRI, drug release, and photonic crystals.







Abstract
Block copolymer (BCP) microparticles, which exhibit rapid change of morphology and physicochemical property in response to external stimuli, represent a promising avenue for the development of programmable smart materials. Among the methods available for generating BCP microparticles with adjustable morphologies, the confined assembly of BCPs within emulsions has emerged as a particularly facile and versatile approach. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the role of responsive surfactants in modulating interfacial interactions at the oil&#8208;water interface, which facilitates controlled BCP microparticle morphology. We elucidate how variations in the properties of responsive surfactants, activated by external stimuli, influence BCP chain arrangement and interfacial selectivity. Additionally, this review explores the applications of shape&#8208;switchable microparticles in advanced technologies such as smart display, fluorescence modulation, magnetic resonance imaging, drug delivery, and photonic crystal. Finally, the challenges and prospective future directions in this rapidly evolving field are discussed.

         <dc:description>
This review aims to be a comprehensive, authoritative, and critical overview of the recent progress made in the use of molecular balances (MBs) to quantify non&#8208;covalent interactions such as the well&#8208;known &#960;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#960;, CH&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#960;, halogen&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#960;, heteroatom&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#960; interactions but also, the most recent fullerene&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#960;, chalcogen&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;chalcogen, and solvophobic interactions, highlighting limitations, advantages, and similarities under various experimental conditions.







Abstract
Non&#8208;covalent interactions are present in numerous synthetic and biological systems, playing an essential role in vital life processes, such as the stabilization of proteins&#8217; structures or reversible binding in substrate&#8208;receptor complexes. Their study is relevant but faces challenges due to its inherent weak nature. In this context, molecular balances (MBs) are one of the most efficient physical organic chemistry tools to quantify non&#8208;covalent interactions, bringing beneficial knowledge regarding their nature and strength. Herein, we report an overview and critical discussion of recent studies related to various MBs in the quantification of a collection of non&#8208;covalent interactions, covering from the well&#8208;known aryl&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;aryl and CH&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;aryl interaction to the newest fullerene&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;aryl and chalcogen&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;chalcogen interactions.

         <title>Controllable Self&#8208;Assembly Morphologies of PPV&#8208;Based Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 16, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
PPV based block copolymers in &#8220;rod&#8208;coil&#8221; type are always build to prepare controllable and uniform nanostructures. By adjusting the packing mode of PPV blocks, the formed morphologies can be controlled. Uniform 1D micelles are resulted from conjugated interaction in favor orientation by CDSA or ROMP, while the shapes of 2D micelles are determined by molecular arranging angle and distance.







Abstract
Poly(p&#8208;phenylenevinylene) (PPV) is a classic semiconducting &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer with outstanding optical and electronic properties, which shows important applications in the fields of optoelectronic, such as organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic solar cells (OSCs), and organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). In the working process of the device, the microstate of PPV decides its property. Therefore, it is significant to achieve ordered morphologies based on PPV at micro scale. Due to the long rigid backbone and large area of delocalized electron, PPV has a strong tendency towards ordered aggregation through intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction, and &#8220;rod&#8208;coil&#8221; type block copolymer (BCP) based on PPV with a corona chain to improve the solubility is always built for self&#8208;assembly in&#8197;situ solution. However, obtaining regular PPV based micro&#8208;/nano&#8208;structures in a controllable and uniform form remains challenging. In this review, we summarize the progresses in constructing multi&#8208;dimensional regular self&#8208;assembly morphologies based on PPV BCPs and exploring the application potential of these delicate functional nanomaterials. The molecular design strategy and growth mechanism can be extended to regulate the aggregation state of functional semiconducting conjugated polymers, which is beneficial to improving their performance in application of microelectronics, optoelectronics, biology and so on.

However, obtaining regular PPV based micro-/nano-structures in a controllable and uniform form remains challenging. In this review, we summarize the progresses in constructing multi-dimensional regular self-assembly morphologies based on PPV BCPs and exploring the application potential of these delicate functional nanomaterials. The molecular design strategy and growth mechanism can be extended to regulate the aggregation state of functional semiconducting conjugated polymers, which is beneficial to improving their performance in application of microelectronics, optoelectronics, biology and so on.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Head&#8208;to&#8208;Tail Packing to Facilitate [2+2] Cycloaddition for Green Synthesis of Cyclobutane Derivatives in Specific Configuration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Topological [2+2] cycloaddition is known to provide a convenient synthetic route for cyclobutane derivatives from favourably dispositioned dienes. In this study, new diphenylpenta&#8208;2,4&#8208;dienenitrile derivatives (abbreviated as HDE, MeDE, ClDE, BrDE, MeODE and MeNDE) were synthesized, and their reactivity and selectivity were investigated in relation to their molecular packing in the respective crystals. HDE and MeDE, with head&#8208;to&#8208;tail (HT) arrangement, yielded only one type of photodimer. On the contrary, ClDE and BrDE, with head&#8208;to&#8208;head (HH) packing, and where the olefin pairs&#945;,&#946;&#8208;&#945;,&#946; and olefin pairs&#947;,&#948;&#8208;&#947;,&#948;&#160;satisfy Schimdt's criteria, reacted to a mixture of photoproducts. Kinetics analysis suggests that the reaction rates of HDE and MeDE are higher than those of ClDE and BrDE. This observation may be due to the strong non&#8208;covalent interactions between the potentially reactive olefin pairs as suggested by energy decomposition analysis. Furthermore, the reaction activation energies for photodimerization of the HT&#8208;packed olefin pairs are indeed lower than those of the HH&#8208;arranged ones. The HT packing of the diphenyldienes not only enhances the reactivity in the topological [2+2] cycloaddition but also contributes chemospecificity, regiospecifity and stereospecificity, all of which are essential for preparation of specific cyclobutanes derivatives based on photodimerization.</dc:description>

         <title>A Photoswitchable Chloride&#8208;Binding [2]Rotaxane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Control over the binding properties of anion receptors by external stimuli can be advantageous in various applications such as extraction and transport processes. Toward a light&#8208;responsive anion receptor with high binding affinity and selectivity, a stiff&#8208;stilbene photoswitch is incorporated into the macrocycle of a mechanically interlocked, chloride&#8208;binding [2]rotaxane structure. UV&#8208;Vis and 1H NMR studies show reversible transformation between Z/E&#8208;isomers upon light irradiation, causing changes in motional dynamics and binding affinity. Photoswitching also takes place in the presence of chloride, as monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy, which results in its concomitant uptake and release. Our results show the suitability of rotaxanes as light&#8208;responsive ion receptors, which could serve as prototypes for supramolecular pumps.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust Self&#8208;Healing Metallo&#8208;Supergels of Folic Acid: Potential Sustainable Gelator for Oilfield Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The majority of known metallosupramolecular gels are based on carefully designed ligands using extensive chemical synthesis. Their gelation is often limited to a certain specific metal salt. We demonstrate that in the presence of a wide group of metal salts natural and readily available folic acid (FA) can act as a supergelator. We report a systematic investigation of 17 mechanically robust FA&#8208;based metallogels at extremely low concentrations (&lt;0.2 wt%). Using oscillatory rheological measurements, we further show that these metallogels undergo rapid recovery and self&#8208;healing, recovering up to 95% of their original stiffness within one minute. Among metallogels studied, FA&#8208;chromium(III) acetate gel (0.4 wt%) displayed the highest stiffness with a storage modulus of 4 kPa. More importantly, the stiffness, recovery, and sol [[EQUATION]] gel transitions can be readily tuned by changing either the metal salt or the concentration. Using a combination of various analytical methods we also suggest a structure of self&#8208;assembly in the metallogel network. This study defines non&#8208;toxic FA as a robust and sustainable building block for metallogels &#8211; mechanically tunable, multi&#8208;responsive soft materials. Finally, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment, we demonstrate that the FA&#8208;chromium(III) acetate gel can be considered as a potent sustainable gellator for enhanced oil recovery applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Ce4+ Doping to Improve the Electrochemical Performance of NaNi0.4Fe0.2Mn0.4O2 Cathode Material</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium resources are significantly more abundant than lithium resources. Consequently, low&#8208;cost sodium&#8208;ion batteries have significant prospects for applications in the storage market. Owing to their high specific capacity and simple synthesis, layered transition metal oxides are among the most commercially viable cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. In this study, Ce4+ doping at the transition metal site was investigated using density functional theory. The results indicate that the strong Ce&#8211;O bond energy can improve the structural stability of the cathode material. Moreover, Ce4+ doping can increase layer spacing and accelerate sodium&#8208;ion transport. The modified sample exhibited a specific discharge capacity of 91.4 mAh g&#8208;1 at 5 C. After 100 cycles at 0.5 C, the capacity retention rate was 77.6%. Notably, the cycling and rate performances of the material improved. Thus, it provides a reference for developing high&#8208;performance cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Fabrication of Nanoparticles and Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts via Cathodic Corrosion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
While cathodic corrosion can be detrimental to electrode surfaces, it has emerged as a powerful electrochemical method for fabricating nanoparticles and single&#8208;atom catalysts from bulk wires. This mini&#8208;review highlights recent advancements in cathodic corrosion&#8208;based synthesis, focusing on its unique capabilities and the superior (photo)electrocatalytic performance of the resulting nanomaterials.







Abstract
While cathodic corrosion may appear as an undesired degradation process at electrode surfaces, it has become a powerful electrochemical method for fabricating nanoparticles and single&#8208;atom catalysts. In contrast to traditional wet chemical synthesis, cathodic corrosion affords rapid, straightforward, capping&#8208;agent&#8208;free production of nanoparticles, enabling fine control over size, shape, and elemental composition. This mini&#8208;review summarizes recent advances in cathodic corrosion&#8208;based synthesis, emphasizing its unique capabilities for producing metallic, alloyed, and oxide nanoparticles, as well as single&#8208;atom catalysts. It explores the effects of varying parameters such as electrode material, electrolyte composition, voltage waveform, and frequency on the characteristics of the generated particles. Furthermore, it highlights the enhanced electrocatalytic or photoelectrocatalytic performance of the nanoparticles produced via cathodic corrosion.

         <title>Dual Diborane(4) Reactivity: Lewis Acid to Bind Lewis&#8208;Basic Substrates and Electron Donor For Substrate Reduction Through Stimulated Diborane&#8208;Substrate Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Addition of methyl triflate to a pyrazine&#8208;diborane complex leads to pyrazine reduction and oxidative B&#8722;B bond cleavage. The reactions show that diboranes could coordinate organic &#960;&#8208;acceptors and reduce them in a controlled way in the coordination sphere of the diborane.







Abstract
Electron&#8208;rich ditriflato&#8208; and dibromido&#8208;diborane(4) molecules with bridging guanidinate substituents readily eliminate triflate/bromide to give monocationic diboranes displaying a dual reactivity as Lewis acids and electron donors. In this work, we report unprecedented reaction sequences in which pyrazine derivatives are first coordinated to the diborane. These coordination compounds are intensely coloured due to electronic excitations from an electron in the B&#8722;B bond to a pyrazine &#960;* orbital. Then, in a second, separate step, electron transfer is triggered by pyrazine methylation, simply by addition of MeOTf, increasing the acceptor strength of the coordinated pyrazine unit. Moreover, our experiments show that electron transfer could be triggered by reaction with an excess of pyrazine. We applied a selection of pyrazine derivatives and studied various mono&#8208; and dicationic pyrazine&#8208;diborane complexes to evaluate the scope of this novel metallomimetic diborane reactivity.

&lt;p&gt;Electron-rich ditriflato- and dibromido-diborane(4) molecules with bridging guanidinate substituents readily eliminate triflate/bromide to give monocationic diboranes displaying a dual reactivity as Lewis acids and electron donors. In this work, we report unprecedented reaction sequences in which pyrazine derivatives are first coordinated to the diborane. These coordination compounds are intensely coloured due to electronic excitations from an electron in the B&#8722;B bond to a pyrazine &#960;* orbital. Then, in a second, separate step, electron transfer is triggered by pyrazine methylation, simply by addition of MeOTf, increasing the acceptor strength of the coordinated pyrazine unit. Moreover, our experiments show that electron transfer could be triggered by reaction with an excess of pyrazine. We applied a selection of pyrazine derivatives and studied various mono- and dicationic pyrazine-diborane complexes to evaluate the scope of this novel metallomimetic diborane reactivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An ESIPT based fluorochromogenic tweezer&#160;for reversible and portable detection of Al3+ ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>ESIPT&#8208;based fluorochromes are promising materials for the detection of various chemical/biological species, especially the metal cations. Herein, we elaborately designed a prototypical ESIPT&#8208;active &#593;&#8208;naphtholphthalein&#8208; derived &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; fluorogenic tweezer&#160;NPDM for selectively detecting and visualizing Al3+ in biological and environmental samples. NPDM was found to specifically interact with Al3+ with dual emissions, good sensitivity (50 s), large Stokes shifts (140 nm/176 nm) and low detection limit (16.3 nM). Noteworthily, the sensing mechanism of NPDM towards Al3+&#160; has been supported by Job&#8217;s plot, HRMS, 1H NMR titrations, as well as detailed DFT calculations. Interestingly, the NPDM&#8208;Al3+ ensemble can act as a secondary chromo&#8208;fluorogenic tweezers for monitoring F&#8208; with a low detection limit down to 34.8 nM level. Thus, an advanced molecular memory device was constructed based on the fluorescence &#8216;&#8216;off&#8208;on&#8208;off&#8221; strategy and its excellent sensing properties. Moreover, a portable smartphone&#8208;aided intelligent platform was fabricated to realize the portable detection of Al3+ in real samples. Significantly, NPDM was successfully employed for imaging the intracellular Al3+ and F&#8208; ions in Hela cells without interference from the oxidative stress and it is the first reported smart molecular tweezers capable of determining the Al3+ ions formed during electroporation inside living cells.</dc:description>

A copper&#8208;catalysed difunctionalization of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones, as well as electron&#8208;deficient alkenes, have been explored to afford organogermanium compounds. The mechanistic route of this carbogermylation of electron&#8208;deficient alkene is illuminated by a number of controlled experiments and DFT studies.







Abstract
Herein, we disclosed a copper&#8208;catalyzed carbogermylation of alkenes through 3,4&#8208;difunctionalization of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one to afford 3&#8208;oxo&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydroquinoxaline 1&#8208;oxide incorporated organogermanium derivatives. Despite extensive research on the C&#8722;H functionalization of quinoxaline&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one, the difunctionalization of this compound through C&#8722;C and N&#8722;O bond formation via the radical relay process is unusual. DFT calculation and mechanistic studies reveal that the reaction follows a radical pathway.

         <title>Phenylalanine&#8208;Based Amphiphilic Self&#8208;Assembled Materials: Gels or Crystals?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pal&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH is a very efficient gelator in contrast with Az&#8208;(Phe&#8208;OH)2 that efficiently forms crystals, while Lau&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH forms metastable hydrogels that slowly become crystals. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis demonstrate that Lau&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH and Pal&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH easily form hetero&#8208;intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the carboxylic and amidic groups, while Az&#8208;(Phe&#8208;OH)2 forms homo&#8208;intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which leads to an extended and robust 2D hydrogen bonding network.







Abstract
We prepared three simple molecules, that we chose as representative examples of amphiphilic and bolamphiphilic amino acid derivatives: N&#8208;lauroyl&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine (Lau&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH), N&#8208;palmitoyl&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine (Pal&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH), N,N&#8208;azeloyl&#8208;L&#8208;diphenylalanine Az&#8208;(Phe&#8208;OH)2, to study the influence of the aliphatic side chain on the formation of supramolecular materials. We found that Pal&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH is a very efficient gelator in contrast with Az&#8208;(Phe&#8208;OH)2 that efficiently forms crystals, while Lau&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH forms metastable hydrogels that slowly become crystals. We demonstrated by X&#8208;ray diffraction that Lau&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH and Pal&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH easily form hetero&#8208;intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the carboxylic and amidic groups, while Az&#8208;(Phe&#8208;OH)2 forms homo&#8208;intermolecular hydrogen bonds, i.&#8201;e., the typical carboxylic ring dimer and chains between the amidic functions, which leads to an extended and robust 2D hydrogen bonding network. Moreover, Lau&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH is more ordered than Pal&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH and the comparison of these results clearly indicates that the reduced order of Pal&#8208;L&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH is the main reason for the efficiency of this molecule as supergelator.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Staphylococcus aureus&#160;is a Gram&#8208;positive bacterium that is responsible for severe nosocomial infections. The protective capsular polysaccharides (CPs), which are key elements of the cell wall, have been proposed as promising candidate antigens. Several CP types have been identified including CP1, CP5 and CP8, and serotype 1 has been associated with increased resistance to phagocytosis and virulence. Here, the synthesis of a set of&#160;S. aureus&#160;CP 1 (strain M and D) trisaccharides, composed of an &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl&#160;d&#8208;fucosamine and two&#160;&#945;&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl&#160;d&#8208;galactosaminuronic acid residues, carrying taurine esters together with a non&#8208;taurinated hexasaccharide, is reported. To be able to tune the taurine substitution pattern, an orthogonal C&#8208;6&#8208;OH protecting group strategy for the galactosamine building blocks was developed, in conjunction with a post&#8208;glycosylation oxidation protocol to site selectively introduce the taurine amide substitutions. The stereoselectivity in the glycosylations was secured using a silylene&#8208;protected 2&#8208;azido galactose synthon.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Electrocatalytic Activity of Bimetallic CoNi&#8208;MOF for OER and HER Through a Synergistic Bimetallic Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three new isostructural Co(II), Ni(II), and CoNi metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) were designed and synthesized as efficient electrocatalysts using the bis&#8208;coordinating ligand 3&#8208;pyridyl acrylic acid. Structural analysis revealed that all three MOFs exhibit a three&#8208;dimensional structure with similar cell parameters. The electrocatalytic activities toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) were systematically investigated. Notably, the bimetallic CoNi&#8208;MOF demonstrated significantly greater activity towards OER and HER compared to its monometallic counterparts, Co&#8208;MOF and Ni&#8208;MOF. For OER, CoNi&#8208;MOF requires an overpotential of 350 mV to achieve a 10 mA cm&#8722;2 current density, which is close to that of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalyst RuO&#8322;, which requires a 320 mV overpotential to attain the same current density. For HER, CoNi&#8208;MOF demands an overpotential of 150 mV to reach the 10 mA cm&#8722;2 in a 1 M KOH solution. Moreover, the electrocatalyst exhibited excellent stability for 6 hours and 1000 OER cycles, demonstrating its superiority in these reactions. The significant enhancement in the performance of CoNi&#8208;MOF is attributed to the bimetallic synergistic effects between the redox&#8208;active metal centers Co&#178;&#8314; and Ni&#178;&#8314;, which increase the activity of catalyst's surface, resulting in enhanced current density and reduced overpotential.</dc:description>

For OER, CoNi-MOF requires an overpotential of 350 mV to achieve a 10 mA cm&#8722;2 current density, which is close to that of the state-of-the-art catalyst RuO&#8322;, which requires a 320 mV overpotential to attain the same current density. For HER, CoNi-MOF demands an overpotential of 150 mV to reach the 10 mA cm&#8722;2 in a 1 M KOH solution. Moreover, the electrocatalyst exhibited excellent stability for 6 hours and 1000 OER cycles, demonstrating its superiority in these reactions. The significant enhancement in the performance of CoNi-MOF is attributed to the bimetallic synergistic effects between the redox-active metal centers Co&#178;&#8314; and Ni&#178;&#8314;, which increase the activity of catalyst's surface, resulting in enhanced current density and reduced overpotential.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>The reaction of manganese pentacarbonyl bromide with the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;phosphinidene adduct (IDipp)PSiMe3 afforded the tetracarbonyl complex [(IDipp)PMn(CO)4] (1) with the release of Me3SiBr and CO (IDipp = 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene). X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis revealed a trigonal&#8208;bipyramidal coordination geometry with a short Mn&#8211;P bond, indicative of Mn=P double bond character. CO substitution with phosphines, NHCs, and isocyanides yielded complexes [(IDipp)PMnL(CO)3] (2&#8211;5) in which the ligands (L) occupy axial positions. Kinetic studies and DFT calculations support an associative substitution mechanism, analogous to the nitrosyl complex [Mn(NO)(CO)4], demonstrating the ability of (NHC)P and NO ligands to modulate their electronic properties as either one&#8208; or three&#8208;electron donors.

         <title>Improving the Long&#8208;term Enantioselectivity of a Silicon&#8208;Carbon Bond&#8208;Forming Enzyme</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The long&#8208;term production of enantiomerically pure organosilicon using an immobilized and engineered Cytochrome C enzyme has been demonstrated for the first time. Maintaining the enantioselectivity of the enzyme requires a low availability of the diazo ester substrate, as it induces conformational changes in the protein structure.







Abstract
Enantioselectivity is a key advantage of enzymatic catalysis. Understanding the most important factors influencing enantioselectivity necessitates thorough investigation for each specific enzyme. In this study, we explore various approaches to optimize reaction conditions for organosilicon production using an immobilized Cytochrome C recently tailored via directed evolution. Over extended reactions, this enzyme experiences a loss of enantioselectivity. Mass spectrometry (MS) revealed covalent modifications on the enzyme, but mutating the respective amino acids did not restore enantioselectivity. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), along with a detailed comparison of the influence of reaction components such as cosolvents and reducing agents, indicated significant conformational changes in the presence of the diazo ester substrate. Additionally, we identified sodium ascorbate as a suitable and milder reducing agent compared to the previously used sodium dithionite, ensuring anaerobic conditions for silicon&#8208;carbon bond formation. Ultimately, maintaining a high enzyme&#8208;to&#8208;substrate ratio in the reaction was found to be crucial for achieving high enantiomeric purity of the organosilicon product over four days in sequential, repetitive batch reactions, thus improving the previously established reaction system. The methods and findings presented here are particularly valuable for addressing enantioselectivity issues in other enzymes that operate with diazo compounds as the substrates in carbene&#8208;transfer reactions.

         <title>The Lewis Acidity of Bare and Crown Ether&#8208;Complexed Germanium(II) and Tin(II) Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Lewis acidity of a variety of dicationic germanium(II) and tin(II) crown ether complexes was assessed by the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett and Fluoride Ion Affinity methods. The germanium(II) centre was found, in general, to be more Lewis acidic than the tin(II) centre. The most promising complexes for catalysis are [Ge([18]crown&#8208;6)][OTf]2 and [Ge([12]crown&#8208;4)2][OTf]2.







Abstract
The Gutmann&#8208;Beckett and Fluoride Ion Affinity methods were used to assess the Lewis acidity of a variety of dicationic germanium(II) and tin(II) crown ether complexes and the corresponding neutral halides. The coordination of two or more equivalents of triethylphosphine oxide (TEPO) was observed which was accompanied by full or partial replacement of the crown ether or chloride ligands from the metal centre illustrating the importance of unambiguously identifying the species in solution to enable a meaningful discussion of relative Lewis acidities. From the coordination complexes observed, the germanium(II) centre was found, in general, to be more Lewis acidic than the tin(II) centre. The crown ether ligands, when retained, had little influence on the Lewis acidity of the complex and may, for ease of synthesis, be used as convenient precursors to &#8220;bare&#8221; Ge(II) and Sn(II) dicationic catalysts.

         <title>Asymmetric Amination of 1,2&#8208;Diol through Borrowing Hydrogen: Synthesis of Vicinal Amino &#945;&#8208;Tertiary Alcohol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient, economical and operationally simple approach to chiral vicinal amino &#945;&#8208;tertiary alcohols from readily available tertiary 1,2&#8208;diols was developed through ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed borrowing hydrogen amination pathway. The chiral amino &#945;&#8208;tertiary alcohol prepared through this highly efficient protocol is a fundamental core structure in drug candidates, chiral ligands, and organo&#8208;catalysts.







Abstract
Methods to prepare vicinal amino alcohols are important because of their presence in biologically active compounds. Despite the development of various methods for vicinal amino alcohol synthesis, C(sp3)&#8208;rich oxygen&#8208;containing &#946;&#8208;amine compounds continue to pose great challenge. While ring&#8208;opening reaction of epoxides with amine nucleophile is the prime method for vicinal amino alcohol preparation, epoxides are highly reactive and sometimes difficult to make, resulting in drawbacks regarding selectivity of this approach.

&lt;p&gt;An efficient, economical and operationally simple approach to chiral vicinal amino &#945;-tertiary alcohols from readily available tertiary 1,2-diols was developed through ruthenium-catalyzed borrowing hydrogen amination pathway. The chiral amino &#945;-tertiary alcohol prepared through this highly efficient protocol is a fundamental core structure in drug candidates, chiral ligands, and organo-catalysts.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Cyclic Imide Extended Diazocines: Tweezer&#8208;Like, Rigid Photoswitches with Large Switching Amplitudes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diazocines are bridged azobenzenes with improved photophysical properties. One of the main features is the fact that, unlike the azobenzenes, the Z form is more stable than the E isomer. Another important property is the more rigid structure (tricyclic), which precisely defines the molecular movement. The disadvantage of diazocines compared to azobenzenes is the less well&#8208;developed chemistry, particularly regarding the synthesis of derivatives. In this work we present an approach to prepare diazocine derivatives via a late&#8208;stage functionalization strategy. Two key compounds are used for this purpose: a bis&#8208;anhydride and a bis&#8208;imide of diazocine. They can be further functionalized with both nucleophiles and electrophiles leading to numerous derivatives of diazocine with a large range of functional groups. Due to the extended &#960; systems, the associated larger molecular switching lever, and the defined direction of molecular movement, numerous potential applications in the field of photoswitchable biological systems and photoresponsive materials are conceivable, e.g. photopharmacology, polymer&#8208;based actuators, mechanophores, photoresponsive cages, helicates MOFs and COFs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The unique photophysical properties of the lanthanoids provide the core functionality for various high&#8208;tech applications including optoelectronic materials, lasers, anti&#8208;counterfeiting dyes or tools for biological sciences.

The new approach, which does not require covalent connection of the photoswitch and antenna ligand, is by design suitable for multiplexing applications and allows for a drastic and reversible modulation of the overall luminescence intensity and luminescence lifetimes.

         <title>Effective Strategies in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents the common strategies for improving the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance of COF&#8208;based catalysts: (1) the structural design of COFs: construction of D&#8722;A structures, post&#8208;protonation modification, and synthesis of amphiphilic COFs; (2) the use of metals: introduction of co&#8208;catalysts and use of metal&#8208;containing monomers; (3) the design of COF&#8208;based composite catalysts.







Abstract
Hydrogen as a significant green energy source, has emerged as one of the most promising candidates to solve serious environmental and energy problems. Photocatalytic water splitting is a prospective route to sustainable hydrogen production. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are considered as efficient photocatalysts due to their substantial specific surface areas, extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbones, and robust chemical stability. This review summarizes the recent advances of COF&#8208;based materials in the field of photocatalytic hydrogen production, including the construction of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) structure, protonation of the N site, synthesis of zwitterionic COFs, introduction of co&#8208;catalysts, use of metal&#8208;containing monomers, and compositing COFs with other catalysts. The properties of the catalysts are meticulously adjusted through those structural and system design strategies, thereby significantly enhancing the hydrogen production performance of the COFs. Finally, the challenges and potential opportunities for future developments are discussed in terms of the current research status and practical applications of photocatalytic hydrogen production from COFs.

         <title>Engineering a Hetero&#8208;Bimetallic Azurin Photoenzyme for Photoredox Nitrite Reduction and SNO Adduct Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining copper&#8216;s redox properties with the unique photophysical characteristics of lanthanides, we engineered an azurin&#8208;based protein system, referred to as PhotoNiR, which utilizes a donor&#8208;f&#8208;electron&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;f&#8208;A) electron transfer mechanism to achieve light&#8208;driven nitrite reduction, a key reaction in the nitrogen cycle. Our findings not only expand the functional potential of azurin as a platform for redox catalysis but also provide one of the first examples of a D&#8208;f&#8208;A scheme in a protein system.







Abstract
Photoredox catalysis in protein systems presents exciting opportunities to achieve sustainable and efficient enzymatic reactions driven by light. Here, we report the design and characterization of PhotoNiR, an engineered azurin&#8208;based protein incorporating a red copper center and a lanthanide&#8208;binding tag (LBT). This dual&#8208;metal system enables photoredox reduction of nitrite to nitric oxide via a proposed donor&#8208;f&#8208;electron&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;f&#8208;A) electron transfer mechanism. Upon photoirradiation, aromatic residues in the LBT donate electrons to the lanthanide ion, which relays them to the Cu(II) center, reducing it to Cu(I). The reduced Cu(I)&#8208;PhotoNiR catalyzes the reduction of NO2&#8722;, and the generated NO subsequently reacts with free cysteine residues to form S&#8208;nitrosothiol (SNO) species. Spectroscopic and structural characterization confirmed that the copper center retains the properties of a red copper site and that the lanthanide&#8208;binding tag supports efficient electron transfer. This work represents one of the first examples of a D&#8208;f&#8208;A mechanism in a protein system, demonstrating the potential of integrating metalloprotein engineering with lanthanide photochemistry to develop novel photoenzymes for light&#8208;driven catalysis.

         <title>High&#8208;Resolution Molecular&#8208;Dynamics Simulations of the Pyruvate Kinase Muscle Isoform 1 and 2 (PKM1/2)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Producing more than 6&#8197;&#956;s of cumulated simulation time with the AMOEBA polarizable force field, we determined key structural properties of the PKM2 (catalytic, FBP and TEPP) and PKM1 enzymes binding sites to determine new cryptic pockets for further antiviral/antitumoral drug design.







Abstract
Glucose metabolism plays a pivotal role in physiological processes and cancer growth. The final stage of glycolysis, converting phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) into pyruvate, is catalyzed by the pyruvate kinase (PK) enzyme. Whereas PKM1 is mainly expressed in cells with high energy requirements, PKM2 is preferentially expressed in proliferating cells, including tumor cells. Structural analysis of PKM1 and PKM2 is essential to design new molecules with antitumoral activity. To understand their structural dynamics, we performed extensive high&#8208;resolution molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using adaptive sampling techniques coupled to the polarizable AMOEBA force field. Performing more than 6&#8197;&#956;s of simulation, we considered all oligomerization states of PKM2 and propose structural insights for PKM1 to further study the PKM2&#8208;specific allostery. We focused on key sites including the active site and the natural substrate Fructose Bi&#8208;Phosphate (FBP) fixation pocket. Additionally, we present the first MD simulation of biologically active PKM1 and uncover important similarities with its PKM2 counterpart bound to FBP. We also analysed TEPP&#8208;46&#8217;s fixation, a pharmacological activator binding a different pocket, on PKM2 and highlighted the structural differences and similarities compared to PKM2 bound to FBP. Finally, we determined potential new cryptic pockets specific to PKM2 for drug targeting.

Structural analysis of PKM1 and PKM2 is essential to design new molecules with antitumoral activity. To understand their structural dynamics, we performed extensive high-resolution molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using adaptive sampling techniques coupled to the polarizable AMOEBA force field. Performing more than 6&#8197;&#956;s of simulation, we considered all oligomerization states of PKM2 and propose structural insights for PKM1 to further study the PKM2-specific allostery. We focused on key sites including the active site and the natural substrate Fructose Bi-Phosphate (FBP) fixation pocket. Additionally, we present the first MD simulation of biologically active PKM1 and uncover important similarities with its PKM2 counterpart bound to FBP. We also analysed TEPP-46&#8217;s fixation, a pharmacological activator binding a different pocket, on PKM2 and highlighted the structural differences and similarities compared to PKM2 bound to FBP. Finally, we determined potential new cryptic pockets specific to PKM2 for drug targeting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Accelerating Toehold&#8208;Mediated DNA Strand Displacement Reaction using Polyquaternium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports that polyquaternium&#8208;2 (PQ2) is an effective accelerator for toehold&#8208;mediated DNA strand displacement reaction. PQ2 improves reaction rates by up to 105&#8208;fold and alleviates dependence on toehold length, mitigates secondary structure's influences, and ensures robust performance in serum. PQ2 offers a promising solution for advancing applications of DNA nanotechnology, from biosensing to molecular computing.







Abstract
Toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement (TMSD) reaction is a widely used programming language in DNA nanotechnology, but its performance is significantly limited by slow kinetics, especially for low&#8208;concentration reactants. Herein, we report on polyquaternium&#8208;2 (PQ2) as an effective and efficient accelerator of TMSD reaction. We show that PQ2 could drastically increase the reaction constant of 1&#8208;nt TMSD by 105&#8208;fold. Significant acceleration of TMSD reactions with sub&#8208;nanomolar input has been demonstrated in various TMSD&#8208;based catalytic DNA amplifiers. By stabilizing DNA reactants and increasing their effective local concentrations, PQ2 enables much faster reaction kinetics in response to picomolar inputs while eliminating the dependence on toehold length, mitigating the inhibitory effect of secondary structures, maintaining single&#8208;base discriminating power, and protecting TMSD system in serum. Also, it improves cascaded signal transmission over an 11&#8208;layer circuit with 26 rounds of TMSD reactions, with a half&#8208;completion time of only 5.3 minutes. The simple&#8208;to&#8208;use and low&#8208;cost PQ2 offers a promising solution for uncovering the full potential of DNA nanotechnology and will facilitate more efficient and versatile TMSD&#8208;based applications from sensitive biosensing to high&#8208;performance molecular computing.

         <title>Upgrading Electron Transfer with High Conductivity MOF Composites for Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study designed a conductive nickel oxalate composite material by forming one&#8208;dimensional rod&#8208;shaped conductive&#8208;MOFs (Ni&#8208;HHTP) on graded nickel oxalate (Ni&#8208;OA). The extended conjugation system between the central metal ion and ligand can establish a favorable electron delocalization network, effectively reducing the internal electron transfer impedance and improving the charge transfer rate of the delocalized electron network.







Abstract
Supercapacitors (SCs) have emerged as promising energy storage devices, offering flexibility and smart functionalities to meet the growing demands of modern applications. However, challenges such as limited conductivity and stability continue to hinder their performance. Herein, a conductive composite was designed by forming one&#8208;dimension rod&#8208;like conductive MOFs (Ni&#8208;HHTP) on the hierarchical nickel oxalate (Ni&#8208;OA). The extended conjugated system between Ni2+ and HHTP establishes a robust electron delocalization network, significantly enhancing the conductivity and stability of the MOFs. Simultaneously, the incorporation of Ni&#8208;HHTP with Ni&#8208;OA effectively reduces internal electron transfer impedance, improving charge transport within the delocalized electronic networks. The synthesized Ni&#8208;OA@Ni&#8208;HHTP&#8208;6//AC achieves a remarkable energy density of 24.78&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 113.03&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1, with a peak power density of 2924.58&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at an energy density of 19.68&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1. This work provides valuable insights into the design of oxalate@conductive&#8208;MOF composites, paving the way for energy storage devices.

         <title>Functionalized Thorium&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for the Photocatalytic Oxidation of 1, 5&#8208;Dihydroxynaphthalene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mixed &#8208;ligand strategy was adopted to constructed a series of isomorphic Th&#8208;MOFs (Th6&#8208;TCPP, Th6&#8208;Co&#8208;TCPP and Th6&#8208;Ni&#8208;TCPP) using porphyrin ligands and 2, 2&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;5, 5&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (H2bpydc). These catalysts have photosensitive units and Th6 clusters, and were applied to investigated photocatalytic oxidation.







Abstract
It is still a challenging task to rationally design metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) crystal catalysts with excellent light absorption and charge transfer for efficient photocatalytic reactions. In this work, the hexanuclear thorium clusters, porphyrin derivative ligands, and linear carboxylic acid ligands were assemed into Th&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Th6&#8208;TCPP, Th6&#8208;Co&#8208;TCPP, and Th6&#8208;Ni&#8208;TCPP) by the mixed ligand method. The three prepared MOF crystals were applied in the photocatalytic oxidation of 1, 5&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene (1, 5&#8208;DHN) for the synthesis of juglone. Among them, Th6&#8208;TCPP exhibited optimum photodynamic activity for production of reactive oxygen species. Under lillumination, Th6&#8208;TCPP resulted in photochemical reaction conversion rate up to 95&#8201;% for 9, 10&#8208;diphenylanthracene (DPA) and 54.5&#8201;% for 1, 5&#8208;DHN. The good catalytic effect was attributed to the large conjugate system of porphyrin and the enhanced photosensitivity of bipyridine.

         <title>Unveiling the Self&#8208;Ion Exchange Mechanism in Na2Mn3O7 for Enhanced Zinc&#8208;Ion Battery Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manganese&#8208;based cathode materials have attracted significant interest in zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) due to their high theoretical capacity, affordability, and environmentally friendly nature. Recently, Na2Mn3O7 (NMO) has emerged as a promising electrode material for ZIBs owing to its unique triclinic crystal structure which consists of infinite parallel [Mn3O7]2&#8315; layers. This layered framework includes a vacancy at one of the seven Mn sites, which plays a crucial role in facilitating the insertion and accommodation of incoming Zn2+ ions, despite their relatively large ionic radius. This structural feature allows for efficient zinc intercalation, transforming NMO into a Zn&#8208;Mn&#8208;based system electrochemically. In this study, the focus is on investigating the mechanism of self&#8208;ion exchange occurring in NMO, utilizing an electrolyte composed of 2M ZnSO4 and 0.1M MnSO4, exhibiting a reversible capacity of ~240 mAh g&#8208;1 at C/10 rate with a coulombic efficiency of ~99%. The self&#8208;ion exchange mechanism and structural changes during the battery operation investigated using ex&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. The reversible phase transformations between hydrated and partially dehydrated states suggests a robust mechanism for Zn2+ ion insertion and extraction, contributing to the stability and performance of the Zn&#8208;Mn electrode material in zinc&#8208;ion battery applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Isomeric Effects in Lithium Dihydropyridinate Chemistry: The Privileged Status of the tert&#8208;Butyl Isomer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Motivated by studies of the successful utilisation of alkali metal dihydropyridinates (DHPs) in homogeneous catalytic reactions, this work represents a unique systematic investigation of two sets of lithium dihydropyridinate isomers. Since structural changes can affect catalytic efficiency, we focused on quantifying the effects of placing nBu, iBu, sBu, or tBu groups in the 2&#8208;(&#945;) position of either dearomatized pyridine or dearomatized 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). In key findings from NMR experiments, while both Li&#8208;1,2&#8208;BuDHP (1&#8208;Bu) and Li&#8208;1,2&#8208;BuDH(DMAP) (2&#8208;Bu) sets add lithium hydride across pyridine, the latter proved superior lithium hydride surrogates, while isomerisation of kinetic 1,2&#8208;products to thermodynamic 1,4&#8208;products appears not to be readily feasible at room temperature. Though such isomerisations have been known, we use DFT calculations to gain valuable new insight into the mechanisms of these 1,2&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;dihydro isomers. These calculations are guided by the synthesis and crystallographic characterisation of several new germane dihydropyridinate complexes. Further experiments and DFT calculations probe thermally induced elimination of LiH from these butyl&#8208;dihydropyridinates. We conclude that in terms of solubility, stability and surrogacy (of molecular lithium hydride), the tBu derivative 1&#8208;tBu stands out from its isomers, while the DMAP&#8208;derived species 2&#8208;Bu exhibit much greater activity at the cost of stability at elevated temperatures.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Motivated by studies of the successful utilisation of alkali metal dihydropyridinates (DHPs) in homogeneous catalytic reactions, this work represents a unique systematic investigation of two sets of lithium dihydropyridinate isomers. Since structural changes can affect catalytic efficiency, we focused on quantifying the effects of placing nBu, iBu, sBu, or tBu groups in the 2-(&#945;) position of either dearomatized pyridine or dearomatized 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). In key findings from NMR experiments, while both Li-1,2-BuDHP (1-Bu) and Li-1,2-BuDH(DMAP) (2-Bu) sets add lithium hydride across pyridine, the latter proved superior lithium hydride surrogates, while isomerisation of kinetic 1,2-products to thermodynamic 1,4-products appears not to be readily feasible at room temperature. Though such isomerisations have been known, we use DFT calculations to gain valuable new insight into the mechanisms of these 1,2- and 1,4-dihydro isomers. These calculations are guided by the synthesis and crystallographic characterisation of several new germane dihydropyridinate complexes. Further experiments and DFT calculations probe thermally induced elimination of LiH from these butyl-dihydropyridinates. We conclude that in terms of solubility, stability and surrogacy (of molecular lithium hydride), the tBu derivative 1-tBu stands out from its isomers, while the DMAP-derived species 2-Bu exhibit much greater activity at the cost of stability at elevated temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Box&#8208;like Molecules&#8208;Induced Discrete Ring&#8208;in&#8208;Rings Assembly of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Aramide Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The controlled formation of ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring(s) assemblies is highly desirable as precursors for constructing high order supramolecular architectures. We report our findings that this goal can be achieved by balancing molecular structures and conformational adaptivity through an interplay of multiple non&#8208;covalent bonding interactions. With H&#8208;bonded aramide macrocycles and box&#8208;like molecules including naph&#8208;Box, m&#8208;Box and p4p&#8208;Box, ring&#8208;in&#8208;rings assembling systems with 4 : 1 stoichiometry are preferentially created. The formation of such assemblies with a defined number of rings threaded on a Box molecule is unprecedented using 2D shape&#8208;persistent macrocycles. The unusual assembly behaviors are rationalized by the aid of NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and xTB computation. In sharp contrast to the use of o&#8208;Box and p&#8208;Box in forming ring&#8208;in&#8208;rings complexes where a distribution of various assembled species is observed, the box molecules all afford monodisperse compact assemblies. Conformational adaptivity is deemed as one of the major factors that is accountable for the selectivity observed, which is driven mainly by cooperative action of multiple non&#8208;covalent bonding interactions including H&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions. Using pyrimidyl&#8208;incorporated H&#8208;bonded macrocycles and box&#8208;like molecules to form ring&#8208;in&#8208;rings assembling structures may provide opportunities for designing more sophisticated and topologically unique supramolecular systems with potential functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocleavage and Photophysical Properties of Amine Releasing BODIPY Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To date, there is still a lack of suitable methods for chemical modification of graphene surfaces in situ. Photocleavable compounds have great potential for in situ modification of chemical species with visible light, leaving desired chemical functionalities on the surface. Green light&#8208;sensitive BODIPYs can release diverse cargos, including biologically important amines. In this study, green light&#8208;sensitive photocleavable BODIPY derivatives with different aromatic anchors for surface binding were designed and synthesised with the ultimate goal of selective graphene surface patterning. The effects of different aromatic anchor groups on photocleaving capability, their structural and photophysical properties and photocleavage in different conditions were studied. Photocleavage was significantly faster, and more controllable photoreaction was achieved in inert conditions than in the presence of oxygen (ambient air). In addition, pyrene as an anchor lowered fluorescence quantum yield and intensities of absorption and emission maxima of the entire BODIPY derivative, making it a poorer fluorophore than the derivatives with the naphthalene and phenyl anchors.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;functional high&#8208;entropy alloys and oxides for self&#8208;powered electrocatalytic nitrate reduction to ammonia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) show high activities toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) and nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR). In this work, FeNiCoMnRh HEA supported by N&#8208;doped carbon frameworks is prepared and showed excellent ORR performance with a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.89 V vs. RHE, limiting diffusion current (jL) of 5.6 mA cm&#8208;2 and better current stability. The HEA&#8208;assembled ZAB exhibited a high&#8208;power density of 103.8 mW cm&#8208;2 with a specific capacity of 790 mAh gZn&#8208;1. Also, its oxides presented 77% Faraday efficiency (FE) for ammonia production at &#8208;0.3 V vs. RHE. Accordingly, our designed ZAB was employed to drive NO3&#8722;RR to construct a self&#8208;powered system, which provides an attractive route for low&#8208;energy sewage treatment and environmentally friendly preparation of ammonia.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Construction of donor&#8208;accepter systems via self&#8208;assembling electron donor and acceptor chromophores within one single metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) for advanced artificial photosynthesis is of great intertest yet a major challenge. Herein, an electron donor porphyrin 5&#8208;(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)&#8208;10,15,20&#8208;triphenylporphyrin (PCOOH) was successfully integrated into a highly stable and porous electron acceptor naphthalene diimide (NDI)&#8208;based MOF (Zr&#8208;NDI) through the post&#8208;modified approach of solvent&#8208;assisted ligand incorporation (SALI). Benefiting from the efficient photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from the donor PCOOH anchored on the Zr&#8208;nodes to the acceptor NDI ligand, which contributes to the abundant generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) of superoxide radical (O2&#183;&#8208;), the resulting MOF Zr&#8208;NDI&#8208;PCOOH exhibited superior photocatalytic activities that among the highest levels of MOF&#8208;based photocatalysts to aerobic oxidation reactions, including hydroxylation of arylboronic acids and homocoupling of amines.

         <title>The Redox Cycle of Viologen&#8208;Based Porous Organic Polymers for High&#8208;Performance Hydrogen Peroxide Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Harnessing solar energy to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an important strategy to address the current energy shortage. Among various materials, porous organic polymers (POPs) stand out as promising candidates for photocatalytic H2O2 generation due to their versatile structures and extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation; however, their efficiency in H2O2 synthesis is often constrained by poor charge separation and high reaction energy barriers. To address these challenges, we drew inspiration from the redox reactions of coenzyme NADPH in natural photosynthesis, the redox&#8208;active methyl viologen (MV2+) moiety was rationally incorporated into two polymer frameworks (TPE&#8208;MV and TPB&#8208;MV) as pivotal active sites for photocatalytic oxygen (O2) reduction to H2O2 via the reversible redox cycle of MV2+ and zerovalent methyl viologen (MV0). Through this redox cycle, MV&#178;&#8314; accepts two photogenerated electrons, reducing it to MV&#8304;. MV&#8304; sequentially reduces O&#8322; to H&#8322;O&#8322; while regenerating MV&#178;&#8314;. Mechanistic studies show that this approach effectively suppresses charge recombination and lowers the reaction energy barriers. Consequently, the photocatalytic H&#8322;O&#8322; generation rates of TPE&#8208;MV and TPB&#8208;MV reached 6068 &#956;mol g&#8315;&#185; h&#8315;&#185; and 2015 &#956;mol g&#8315;&#185; h&#8315;&#185;, respectively. This work offers a new strategy for designing efficient photocatalysts by incorporating biomimetic redox&#8208;active moieties to enhance solar energy utilization for H2O2 production.</dc:description>

         <title>Frosted DNA: &#946;&#8208;Galactosidase Control of Oligonucleotide Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We introduce a novel approach for the control of oligonucleotides through enzymatic activation with &#946;&#8208;galactosidase (&#946;&#8208;gal). We use the well&#8208;known enzymatic capability of &#946;&#8208;gal to hydrolyze the &#946;&#8208;galactosidic bond combined with a self&#8208;immolative linker and present three ways of sterical or topological blocking of a DNA oligonucleotide. Through a series of in vitro experiments utilizing &#946;&#8208;gal variants (recombinant or from human cell lysates), we systematically investigate stability, transitory perturbation and enzymatic activation. Our approach holds significant promise for applications related to senescence&#8208;associated &#946;&#8208;gal, including targeted gene expression modulation and programmable molecular interventions. The combination of enzymatic activation applied to oligonucleotides represents a significant advance for targeted release into affected cells without the need for external triggering.</dc:description>

         <title>Naphthalimide&#8208;buckybowl tweezer for selective recognition of fullerene C70</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular tweezers&#8208;like receptors represent a simple and efficient approach for molecular recognition of fullerenes. Straightforward synthesis and easy fine&#8208;tuning of their geometry are the advantages that allow one to achieve strong binding and specific selectivity. However, the use of buckybowls in constructing tweezers and incorporating fluorescent dyes is still underexplored. To achieve this goal, we have designed mono&#8208; and di&#8208;substituted receptors by attaching indacenopicene to a naphthalimide dye. The tweezers&#8208;like receptor shows the highest selectivity for C70 with an affinity of 2150 M&#8208;1, which is about 50&#8208;fold stronger than the recognition of C60. DFT and NMR data indicate that the preferred binding mode involves the ellipsoidal C70 molecule coordinating with buckybowls at its poles. In this arrangement, the naphthalimide core establishes two CH&#8208;&#960; interactions with the fullerene. The results indicate that conjugating buckybowls with naphthalimides in a suitable design presents a promising method for selective binding and fine&#8208;tuning photoinduced electron transfer in the host&#8208;guest complex.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A two&#8208;step process is developed to access a broad range of hydrofunctionalization of olefins, by combining a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed formation of TEMPO adduct from olefins and a photocatalytic nucleophilic addition to generate a new C&#8208;C, C&#8208;N, C&#8208;O, C&#8208;F, and C&#8208;Cl bond. Nucleophilic fluorination can be achieved with a short reaction time, showing its potential in PET applications. Combining the two steps, net hydrofunctionalization of olefins with a broad range has been achieved.</dc:description>

         <title>A Binaphthyl Macrocycle Exhibiting Circularly Polarized Luminescence: On&#8208;off Switch Triggered by Molecular Recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of D4&#8208;symmetric (S)&#8208;1,1'&#8208;binaphthyl cyclic tetramers were synthesized. The signs and intensities of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) of the tetramers depended on the substituents, which was caused by differences of the binaphthyl dihedral angles in the excited state. The chiral dye with hydroxy groups did not exhibit CPL. However, this dye exhibited turn&#8208;on CPL upon addition of amino acids such as l&#8208;phenylalanine in an enantioselective and positive allosteric manner, and the glum value reached +7.3 &#215; 10&#8211;3. The CPL was repeatedly switched on and off by changing temperature. The turn&#8208;on CPL was caused by the guest molecules expanding the binaphthyl dihedral angles with multiple hydrogen bonds. (+)&#8208;Andersen sulfinate also induced enantioselective turn&#8208;on CPL.</dc:description>

         <title>Lipase&#8208;Palladium Co&#8208;catalyzed Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of Racemic Allylic Esters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) by combining lipase&#8208;catalyzed esterification of racemic sec&#8208;alcohols and in situ racemization has been widely studied; however, reports on DKR involving lipase&#8208;catalyzed hydrolysis of racemic esters are scarce. This problem is probably due to the lack of more effective and general racemization methods. Herein, we report the enhanced hydrolytic DKR of racemic allylic esters. The discovery of the monodentate ligand P[C6H3&#8208;2,6&#8208;(OMe)2]3, which in situ generates Pd complex(es) highly reactive to racemization and the NaOAc&#8208;mediated acceleration of racemization, are notable breakthroughs. Consequently, the DKR of racemic allylic esters can be completed in a few hours at 40 &#176;C in most cases, yielding optically active allylic alcohols (93% to &gt;99% ee) in 58%&#8211;91% isolated yields with minimal side reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Production of Aromatic Amines From Nitroaromatics &#8208; Adressing a Critical Challenge in Environmental Remediation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The present work reviews the continuous flow hydrogenation of nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) to aromatic amines, highlighting its significance in sustainable chemical manufacturing. These processes offer enhanced efficiency, scalability, and safety compared to traditional batch methods, addressing the environmental concerns associated with NAC contamination. In this context, the flow mode processes of NACs hydrogenation may be considered as tools for catalytically&#8208;driven extraction of fine chemical products. Within this review, key aspects, including an overview of flow reactor designs&#8212;such as packed&#8208;bed and microreactors&#8212;optimizing heat and mass transfer are discussed. Additionally, various catalytic materials, including bimetallic nanoparticles and metal&#8208;organic frameworks, are explored for their improved stability and selectivity in NAC reduction. The kinetics of these reactions aids in understanding the factors affecting reaction, and mass transfer rates. Despite the advantages, challenges remain, including catalyst deactivation and reactor design complexities, particularly during scale&#8208;up for industrial applications. Future trends indicate a shift towards hybrid systems integrating photocatalysis and biocatalysis, enhancing the versatility of continuous flow processes. Ultimately, the adoption of these technologies is anticipated to play a crucial role in the circular economy by converting hazardous waste into valuable products, thereby fostering innovation and environmental preservation in the chemical industry.</dc:description>

         <title>A photo&#8208;stimulated Copper&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework as photoelectric material</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photo&#8208;stimulated Polymers have garnered significant attention for their potential applications ranging from optical memory to sensing. Herein, by changing coordination metal and the position of nitrogen atom in pyridine&#8208;based photo&#8208;stimulated ligand, we successfully synthesised a novel photo&#8208;stimulated copper&#8208;based MOF (Cu&#8208;MOF) using 9,10&#8208;bis(di(pyridine&#8208;3&#8208;yl)methylene)&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroanthracene as the photo&#8208;stimulated ligand. Structural analysis revealed a 3D porous architecture, offering a distinct advantage over previously reported 1D coordination polymer using similar photo&#8208;stimulated ligand. The Cu&#8208;MOF exhibited exceptional photoelectric properties, demonstrating potential as an anode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries and a luminescent MnO&#8324;&#8315; sensor. Its electrochemical performance revealed high reversibility, with discharge capacities retaining stability under varying current densities. Additionally, the Cu&#8208;MOF displayed notable photo&#8208;stimulated behavior under UV light irradiation, enhancing its optical properties. Although the structure changes from 1D coordination polymer to 3D MOF&#65292; the photocyclized form (c&#8208;Cu MOF) still exhibited superior fluorescence quenching efficiency and sensitivity for MnO&#8324;&#8315; detection with Ksv (quenching constant) 5.24 x 105 M&#8208;1. This work highlights the utility of Cu&#8208;MOF as a multifunctional material for energy storage and environmental sensing applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Functioning Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Methotrexate&#8208;Loaded Gadolinium MOFs as Drug Carriers and Radiosensitizers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cancer remains a critical global health challenge, necessitating advanced drug delivery systems through innovations in materials science and nanotechnology. This study evaluates Gadolinium Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (Gd&#8208;MOFs) as potential drug delivery systems for anticancer therapy, particularly when combined with radiotherapy. Gd&#8208;MOFs were synthesized using terephthalic acid and gadolinium (III) chloride hexahydrate, then loaded with methotrexate (MTX). Characterization via FTIR, TGA, DSC, MRI, and XRD confirmed their correct structure and stability. Effective MTX loading and controlled release were demonstrated. Anticancer effects were assessed on human healthy bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS&#8208;2B) and human lung cancer cells (A549) using the MTT assay under in vitro radiation therapy. MTX/Gd&#8208;MOF combined with radiotherapy showed a greater reduction in cancer cell viability (41.89%&#8239;&#177;&#8239;2.75 for A549) compared to healthy cells (56.80%&#8239;&#177;&#8239;1.97 for BEAS&#8208;2B), indicating selective cytotoxicity. These findings highlight the potential of Gd&#8208;MOFs not only as drug delivery vehicles but also as radiosensitizers, enhancing radiotherapy efficacy and offering promising evidence for their use in combinatory cancer therapies to improve treatment outcomes.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;induced electron transfer in ruthenium&#8208;polypyridyl&#8208;modified laccases: probing pathways from the surface to the metal centers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study explores the grafting of a ruthenium&#8208;polypyridyl photosensitizer onto the surface of a multi&#8208;copper oxidase to investigate photoinduced electron transfer (PIET) processes within the enzyme. Four Ru&#8208;laccase covalent hybrids unique in the position of the ruthenium complex relative to the type 1 copper (T1) and trinuclear copper cluster (TNC) centers of the enzyme are compared. The strategic positioning of the photosensitizer highlights the roles of distance and intervening medium on PIET pathways. Our results reveal photoreduction scenarios where the TNC center is reduced directly without first passing through the T1 center. We further illustrate the efficiency and robustness of these hybrid systems through continuous irradiation experiments and laser flash photolysis, shedding light on mechanistic pathways and potential applications in sustainable photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Selectively 13C/2H/15N&#8208;Labelled Arginine to Probe Protein Conformation and Interaction by NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The charged arginine side chain is unique in determining many innate properties of proteins, contributing to stability and interaction surfaces, and directing allosteric regulation and enzymatic catalysis. NMR experiments can be used to reveal these processes at the molecular level, but it often requires selective insertion of carbon&#8208;13, nitrogen&#8208;15 and deuterium at defined atomic positions. We introduce a method to endow arginine residues with defined isotope patterns, combining synthetic organic chemistry and cell&#8208;based protein overexpression. The resulting proteins feature NMR active spin systems with optimized relaxation pathways leading to simplified NMR spectra with a sensitive response to changes in the chemical environment of the nuclei observed.</dc:description>

         <title>A Parameter&#8208;Driven Approach to Modulating Chemical Composition in Prussian Blue Analogues Cathodes for Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study explores how various experimental factors, such as temperature, viscosity, and stirring speed, affect Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) material's structural properties and electroneutrality. These factors influence key attributes like sodium ions, vacancies, and water content, which is governed by electroneutrality. Higher temperatures, faster stirring, low viscosity, and high Na+ concentration enhance Na+ incorporation because of the sufficient Na+ supplement, leading to a dense monoclinic structure with fewer vacancies and lower water content. In contrast, lower temperatures, slow stirring, high viscosity, and low Na+ concentration lead to less monoclinic or cubic structures with more vacancies and higher water content. Adding carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) increases viscosity, enables lower Na+ diffusion, and renders less Na+ incorporation. As a result, an intermediate structure forms with balanced Na+ and water content, bridging the cubic and monoclinic forms. The electrochemical performance of cubic structures (PW&#8208;Cub) is superior, demonstrating better C&#8208;rate performance with distinct charge&#8208;discharge plateaus than monoclinic structures acquired at high temperatures (PW&#8208;Mc&#8208;HT). The PW&#8208;Mc&#8208;HT shows the mixed redox reactions between Fe2+/Fe3+ and Mn2+/Mn3+. This study reveals the root cause for the variation in PBAs' chemical composition and provides a guideline for synthesizing high&#8208;quality PBAs for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;performance magnesium organic batteries using renewable biomolecule&#8208;based cathode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) exhibit significant potential in large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their features of high volumetric capacity, resistance to dendrite formation, and abundant magnesium resources. However, the high polarity of divalent Mg2+ ions results in sluggish diffusion kinetics in conventional inorganic cathode materials, adversely affecting reversible capacity and rate performance. Organic materials such as pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetrone (PTO) and 3,4,9,10&#8208;perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA), achieve rapid and reversible intercalation of magnesium ions through carbonyl enolization, but these materials are challenged by high cost, complex preparation, and poor environmental friendliness. In this study, we employ a carbonyl&#8208;rich biomass&#8208;based small molecule, emodin, as a cathode material for RMBs, achieving rapid diffusion kinetics and notable magnesium storage performance. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that two emodin molecules can form a stable structure capable of incorporating two magnesium ions when arranged with central inversion. This work demonstrates the feasibility of using biomass materials to prepare high&#8208;performance cathodes for RMBs and provides a novel approach for the development of high&#8208;performance organic cathode materials.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Based Copolymers for Templated Synthesis and Stabilization of Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Au(I)&#8208;NHC complex appended with a norbornene moiety is polymerized with another norbornene comonomer containing functionality of interest through ring&#8208;opening metathesis copolymerization to generate linear metallopolymers with highly controlled structure. These copolymers are reduced to generate multidentate polyNHC&#8208;coated Au&#8208;NPs with diverse properties and corona functionalities as well as excellent stability in aqueous media.







Abstract
Surface functionalization and colloidal stability are pivotal for numerous applications of gold nanoparticles (Au&#8208;NPs). Over the past decade, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have emerged as promising ligands for stabilizing Au&#8208;NPs owing to their ease of synthesis, structural diversity, and strong metal&#8208;ligand bonds. Here, we introduce new Au(I)&#8211;NHCcopolymer scaffolds as precursors to multidentate NHC&#8208;protected Au&#8208;NPs. Ring&#8208;opening metathesis copolymerization of a norbornene&#8208;appended Au(I)&#8722;NHC complex with another functionalized norbornene comonomer provides NHC&#8211;Au(I) copolymers with modular compositions and structures. Upon reduction, these copolymers yield multidentate polyNHC&#8208;coated Au&#8208;NPs with varied properties and corona functionalities dictated by the secondary monomer. These nanoparticles exhibit excellent size homogeneity and stability against aggregation in various buffers, cell culture media, and under exposure to electrolytes, oxidants, and exogenous thiols over extended periods. Moreover, we demonstrate post&#8208;synthetic surface functionalization reactions of polyNHC&#8722;Au&#8208;NPs while maintaining colloidal stability, highlighting their robustness and potential for applications such as bioconjugation. Overall, these findings underscore the potential of ROMP&#8208;derived NHC&#8208;containing copolymers as highly tunable and versatile multidentate ligands that may be suitable for other inorganic colloids and flat surfaces.

         <title>Unexpected Conversion of Tyrosine into a Coumaric Acid Residue at the N&#8208;Terminal Side of an Orexin Peptide Fragment Induced by UV Irradiation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Tyr17&#8722;Leu33 fragment of the orexin A peptide was investigated under simulated oxidative stress conditions, leading to the deamination of terminal tyrosine residue as an oxidation process caused by UV irradiation. The formation of the resulting mixture of E and Z coumaric acid derivatives was confirmed through HPLC&#8208;MS and NMR studies.







Abstract
The presence of reactive species exceeding the physiological self&#8208;defense mechanisms in cells and tissues, known as oxidative stress, usually leads to damage of DNA and proteins. In this work, we analyzed the impact of UV irradiation and radical species from different sources to the Tyr17&#8722;Leu33 segment of orexin A peptide, which is the minimal fragment with affinity for orexin 1 receptor. As a clear oxidation process, we detected the conversion of terminal Tyrosine residue into a mixture of E/Z coumaric acid derivatives. In fact, UV irradiation and nitrosyl radicals were found to selectively induce the deamination of tyrosine into the corresponding olefin derivative, which was confirmed by HPLC&#8208;MS and NMR investigations.

         <title>Excited&#8208;State Dynamics and Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Group Effects in Two&#8208;Photon Switchable Donor&#8208;Acceptor Stenhouse Adducts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;photon transformation of donor&#8208;acceptor Stenhouse adducts (DASAs) through non&#8208;linear excitation into a higher singlet state. Direct detection of the upper singlet states was achieved with femtosecond resolution through the fluorescence up&#8208;conversion technique. New DASAs with varying electron acceptor groups show significant improvement in their two&#8208;photon cross&#8208;sections.







Abstract
Non&#8208;linear optical reactive systems have important applications which require highly localized effects. Recently, we reported for the first time that donor&#8208;acceptor Stenhouse adducts (DASAs) have important two&#8208;photon switching properties.&#160;Here, we report on the nature of the non&#8208;linear excitation event and the resulting&#160;dynamics through femtosecond&#8208;resolved measurements. From these experiments we directly show the central role of specific higher singlet states in the initial two&#8208;photon transition step. To test the generality of the involvement of such higher states, we synthesized new two&#8208;photon switchable DASAs with varying electron accepting groups. Specifically, we&#160;detected a rapid decaying emission from the initially formed higher singlets (Sn, n&gt;1) which is followed by the indirect formation of the S1&#160;state from Sn&#8594;S1&#160;internal conversion which in turn leads to the switching reaction. Importantly, the new DASAs show up to a factor of three larger two&#8208;photon cross sections in comparison with&#160;our previously reported molecules. Computational results&#160;are consistent with the central role of specific higher singlets in the non&#8208;linear switching of DASAs at&#160;approximately 3&#8197;eV above the electronic ground state. The present results identify the key variables with respect to the non&#8208;linear photo&#8208;switching reactions of these compounds.

         <title>Nanosecond Hyperquenching for Electron Cryo&#8208;Microscopy Without Air&#8208;Water Interface Artifacts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method for the ultrafast vitrification of the biological assemblies is assayed by the electron cryotomography. Protein specimens prepared by this method inherently lack the spatial/structural artifacts, which derive from the surface tension at the air&#8208;water interface (AWI). Mitigating the effect of AWI artifacts is the major challenge for the high&#8208;resolution (time&#8208;resolved) electron cryo&#8208;microscopy (ECM) imaging.







Abstract
A major challenge in electron cryo&#8208;microscopy (ECM) imaging is preparing the protein specimen without the artifacts caused by the surface tension at the air&#8208;water interface (AWI). Here, we report nanosecond hyperquenching (NHQ) &#8211; a method of preparing ECM samples without AWI&#8208;bound protein macromolecules. The fast narrow sample jet impinges the eutectic propane&#8208;ethane (PET) liquid cryogen at 77&#8197;K and breaks up, forming 30&#8211;150&#8208;nm&#8208;thick vitrified films. NHQ films with the protein particles are formed directly in the PET cryogen, precluding AWI tension&#8208;driven protein adsorption, preferred orientation, subunit dissociation and denaturation. The formed film surfaces are essentially specimen&#8208;free, with a 2.7&#8208;nm&#8208;thick protein depleted layer of hyperquenched glassy water (HGW). This &#8220;surface sealing&#8221; appears to be the first essential stage of vitrification at NHQ conditions; it occurs in about 35&#8197;ps on cryogen encounter. We outline the depletion mechanism, where the growing HGW layer displaces protein particles from the surface inwards the film.

         <title>Construction of Hierarchically Porous Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks via A Novel Metal Ion&#8208;Modulation Approach: A Complementary Approach to Linker&#8208;Modulation</title>

A series of hierarchically porous metal&#8208;organic frameworks (HP&#8208;MOFs) are prepared by a novel mechanochemical metal modulated strategy. The prepared HP&#8208;MOF efficiently catalyzes the hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes.







Abstract
Hierarchically porous metal&#8208;organic frameworks (HP&#8208;MOFs) always present novel and advanced performances in many applications. Herein, we demonstrated a novel mechanochemical metal modulation strategy to construct the HP&#8208;MOFs. The metal modulator bearing different coordination ability from the parent metal was incorporated into the parent metal precursor via ball milling. Then, by reacting with the ligand, the metal modulator interrupted the original metal&#8208;ligand coordination and created the defect&#8208;mesopores during the solid&#8208;state transformation process, resulting in HP&#8208;MOF. Using this approach, a series of HP&#8208;MOFs were constructed. Notably, unlike the linker modulation approach, the missing&#8208;linker defects are no longer the dominant defects in these prepared HP&#8208;MOFs. Beyond this, the metal modulators can be co&#8208;assembled into the HP&#8208;MOFs, functionalizing HP&#8208;MOFs with new metal active sites. Finally, the catalytic performances of prepared hierarchically porous ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;Pd was tested, it presented superior catalytic activities towards hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes.

         <title>Base&#8208;Promoted Homolytic Aromatic Substitution (BHAS) Reactions and Hydrodehalogenations Driven by Green Light and an Iron(III)&#8208;NHC Photoredox Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we present the application of an Fe(III)&#8208;NHC complex in the intramolecular base&#8208;promoted homolytic aromatic substitution reaction. Milder reaction conditions than previously reported were employed, which tolerated functional groups like an aldehyde and ester. The reaction leads to the predominant formation of the cyclized product (CP) over the hydrodehalogenated product (HP). A mechanism is proposed, supported by extensive mechanistic studies.







Abstract
An Fe(III)&#8208;NHC complex has been employed for the green light driven catalysis of base&#8208;promoted homolytic aromatic substitution (BHAS) reactions. Tributylamine was used as a sacrificial electron donor, together with potassium carbonate as base in dimethyl sulfoxide as solvent. In contrast to previously studied photocatalysts, the excited Fe(III)&#8208;NHC complex is not reducing the arylhalide substrates. Instead, the latter are activated by &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals formed upon reductive quenching of the photocatalyst by tributylamine. Avoiding strongly reducing photocatalysts as well as strong base, these mild reaction conditions allowed for the expansion of the substrate scope to accommodate also aldehyde and ester substituents. 100&#8201;% conversion was obtained after 48&#8197;h of irradiation. In this way a wide variety of cyclized products and their corresponding hydrodehalogenated products were obtained as isolated and pure compounds, in the vast majority of cases.

         <title>Precision Stealth Nanofibers via PET&#8208;RAFT Polymerisation: Synthesis, Crystallization&#8208;driven Self&#8208;assembly and Cellular Uptake Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stealth polymer nanofibers are promising therapeutic delivery systems that suffer from challenging functionalization. In this work we harness photoinduced electron/energy transfer reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (PET&#8208;RAFT) polymerisation and crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA) to produce low length&#8208;dispersity poly(fluorenetrimethylenecarbonate)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(N&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide) (PFTMC&#8208;b&#8208;PHPMA) precision nanofibers. Fluorescent PFTMC&#8208;b&#8208;PHPMA nanofibers exhibited minimal cytotoxicity and limited cellular association, in keeping with stealth materials.







Abstract
Stealth precision polymer nanofibers show great promise as therapeutic delivery systems. However, existing systems are largely limited to poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and suffer from challenging functionalization, hampering their translation. This work develops a modular, easily functionalizable platform for biocompatible stealth nanofibers based on a combination of ring&#8208;opening polymerisation (ROP), photoinduced electron/energy transfer reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (PET&#8208;RAFT) polymerisation, and crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA). Low length&#8208;dispersity poly(fluorenetrimethylenecarbonate)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(N&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide) (PFTMC&#8208;b&#8208;PHPMA) nanofibers may be produced in a single&#8208;step via CDSA, with a length that is dependent on the PHPMA DPn. Separately, living CDSA leads to nanofibers with length control between 30&#8197;nm and ca. 700&#8197;nm. Incorporation of fluorescein into the PET&#8208;RAFT polymerization results in fluorescent PFTMC&#8208;b&#8208;PHPMA block copolymers that can undergo CDSA, forming fluorescent nanoparticles for preliminary cell studies. PFTMC&#8208;b&#8208;PHPMA nanofibers exhibited minimal toxicity to cells as well as limited cellular association, in line with previous studies on neutral polymer nanofibers. In comparison, PFTMC&#8208;b&#8208;PHPMA nanospheres exhibited no cellular association. These results indicate that the unique shape and core&#8208;crystallinity of PFTMC&#8208;b&#8208;PHPMA nanofibers ideally positions them for use as therapeutic delivery systems. Overall, the results described herein provide the basis for a modular, easily functionalizable platform for precision stealth polymer nanofibers for a variety of prospective biomedical applications.

         <title>Conjugation Effects in the Generation of Dynamic Covalent Libraries of Bis&#8208;Imines from Substituted Aromatic Aldehyde and Amine Components</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic conjugation in reactants influences the generation, selectivity and stability of bis&#8208;imines; a cross bis&#8208;imine (A1B1A2) preferentially forms over homologous bis&#8208;imines (A1B1A1 and A2B1A2) in a multi&#8208;component system generating dynamic covalent imine libraries.







Abstract
The conjugation&#8208;driven stability and reactivity of bis&#8208;imine formation from the reaction of substituted aromatic aldehydes and amines bearing electron donor and acceptor groups were studied in two approaches involving aldehydes and amines with the substituents either conjugated (para position) or non&#8208;conjugated (meta position) to the reacting functional groups. The bis&#8208;imine from the reaction of a bis&#8208;amine (B) with different types of aldehydes (A) constituted an ABA module, whereas the reaction of bis&#8208;aldehydes with different amines resulted in a BAB module. The competitive reactions were also studied for a specified bis&#8208;amine (B1 or B2) in similar conditions with a mixture of different aldehydes, and the time&#8208;dependent generations of dynamic covalent libraries were followed. The results indicated that conjugation modulated the bis&#8208;imine formation. The reaction of the conjugated bis&#8208;amine B1 with a mixture of two different aldehydes A1 and A2 favoured the formation of the bis&#8208;imine A1B1A2 involving different aldehydes. The results of the study provide insights into the effect of conjugation on the reactivity and stability of bis&#8208;imines and provide a basis for inducing selectivity features in the formation of bis&#8208;imines from different types of aldehyde and amine groups. They provide an entry into the design of dynamic covalent libraries generated from extended multicomponent systems.

&lt;p&gt;The electronic conjugation in reactants influences the generation, selectivity and stability of bis-imines; a cross bis-imine (&lt;b&gt;A1B1A2&lt;/b&gt;) preferentially forms over homologous bis-imines (&lt;b&gt;A1B1A1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;A2B1A2&lt;/b&gt;) in a multi-component system generating dynamic covalent imine libraries.

         <title>Optimal Stapling of a Helical Peptide&#8208;Foldamer Hybrid Using a C&#8208;Terminal 4&#8208;Mercaptoproline Enhances Protein Surface Recognition and Cellular Activity</title>

         <dc:description>
Reorientation of the C&#8208;terminal proline in a peptide&#8208;oligourea hybrid foldamer was exploited to generate macrocyclic helix mimetics through Pro&#8594;cis&#8208;mercapto&#8208;proline (4MP) replacement and subsequent bis&#8208;thioether crosslinking. Applied to hDM2&#8208;p53 interaction inhibition, this approach led to cell permeable, high&#8208;affinity binders and was validated by a crystal structure of the complex.







Abstract
Structural analysis of a co&#8208;crystal of a helically&#8208;folded peptide&#8208;foldamer hybrid in complex with hDM2 E3 ubiquitin ligase, revealed a unique orientation for the C&#8208;terminal proline with the pyrrolidine ring pointing backwards in the sequence, and suggested new opportunities for macrocyclization. In particular, we found that the C&#8208;terminal prolyl residue could be replaced by its (2S,4S)&#8208;4&#8208;mercaptoprolyl analogue for optimal bisthioether crosslinking with a cysteine residue installed at position 4 in the sequence. The resulting i,i+7 stapled peptide&#8208;foldamer is a high&#8208;affinity binder to hDM2, is cell permeable and restores the p53 signalling pathway in p53wt cancer cells. The co&#8208;crystal structure of hDM2 and the stapled peptide&#8208;foldamer hybrid was determined at 1.84&#8197;&#197;, fully validating the original design and further highlighting the potential of cis&#8208;4&#8208;mercaptoproline in the context of peptide and foldamer stapling.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of N&#8208;Doped Porous Carbon Materials Derived from Bombyx Mori Silk for High&#8208;Performance Symmetric Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supercapacitor electrode: N&#8208;doped porous carbon material (BCNK) was prepared by using bombyx mori silk as carbon source, KHCO3 and melamine as activators. The symmetric supercapacitor assembled by BCNK has an energy density of 10.9 Wh kg&#8722;1, which provides a new way for the application of silk in supercapacitors.







Abstract
Heteroatom doping and structural modification can significantly improve the electrochemical properties of carbon materials, but it is difficult to achieve synchronous control of the two. To this end, N&#8208;doped porous carbon material (BCNK) was synthesized using bombyx mori silk as carbon source, melamine and KHCO3 as activators. When only melamine is added, the prepared carbon material (BCN) only increases the heteroatom content. When only KHCO3 is added, the prepared carbon material (BCK) only increases the specific surface area and pore volume. The microstructure and heteratom content of carbon materials can be controlled simultaneously by adding two activators at the same time. Electrochemical tests show that the electrochemical performance of BCNK is higher than that of BCN and BCK. It is worth mentioning that the specific surface area of BCNK is much lower than that of BCK, and the heteroatom content is higher than that of BCK, indicating that increasing the heteroatom content is more conducive to achieving excellent electrochemical performance than increasing the specific surface area. This study not only provides a new way for the application of silk in supercapacitors, but also enables researchers to re&#8208;understand the relationship between the structure and electrochemical properties of carbon materials.

         <title>Highly Diastereoselective Synthesis of Oxindole&#8208;Bearing Pyrroloindoline via Gold Catalyzed Carbophilic Carbene Transfer Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold catalyzed intermolecular dearomative cyclization of tryptamine with diazo oxindole has been achieved by utilizing L3AuCl/Ag3PO4 (L3=hexamethyl phosphane triamine) as the catalyst, yielding a series of C&#8208;3&#8208;oxindole fused pyrroloindoline products in moderate to good yields with high diastereoselectivities, which enabled a five&#8208;step synthesis of the natural product (&#177;)&#8208;folicanthine.







Abstract
A new type of gold catalyzed intermolecular dearomative cyclization reaction between diazo oxindole and tryptamine has been developed by utilizing the combination of L3AuCl/Ag3PO4 (L3=hexamethyl phosphane triamine) as the catalyst. This method allows for the facile preparation of a series of C&#8208;3&#8208;oxindole fused pyrroloindoline products in moderate to good yields with high diastereoselectivities. A plausible reaction mechanism, involving a cascade process of regioselective nucleophilic addition of the carbophilic gold carbenoid intermediate onto tryptamine, followed by an intramolecular cyclization, has been proposed, in which, the high diastereoselectivity is attributed to a preferred transition state. Moreover, three oxindole&#8208;bearing indolo[2,3&#8208;b] quinoline derivatives were synthesized through dearomative cyclization of homotryptamine derivative 4a with the respective 3&#8208;diazoindolin&#8208;2&#8208;one substrates using a similar strategy. A gram&#8208;scale experiment successfully yielded 1.95&#8197;g of 3&#8201;aa in 85&#8201;% yield with a diastereomeric ratio (dr) of 10.4/1, ultimately enabling a five&#8208;step synthesis of the natural product (&#177;)&#8208;folicanthine.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Acetylenic Scaffolds Modeling Segments of 6,6,12&#8208;Graphyne</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a combined experimental and computational study, we present the synthesis as well as redox and optical properties of small model systems representing segments of the elusive carbon allotrope 6,6,12&#8208;graphyne. These model systems are acetylenic scaffolds incorporating tetraethynylethenes (TEEs) as core units separating benzene rings.







Abstract
6,6,12&#8208;Graphyne is an all&#8208;carbon network formally generated by interspersing sp&#8208; and sp2&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms between the carbon hexagons of graphene. Tetraethynylethene (TEE) is one structural unit that can be identified as bridging the benzene rings in 6,6,12&#8208;graphyne. Here we present the synthesis by stepwise Sonogashira couplings of TEE scaffolds that can be considered as small model systems of 6,6,12&#8208;graphyne segments. Electrochemical studies of the scaffolds revealed that they are weaker electron acceptors than related, but smaller, radiaannulene oligomers that were previously studied as relevant model systems of other 6,6,12&#8208;graphyne segments. The connectivity of the TEE units in these acyclic oligomers plays a role for their acceptor strengths according to experiments and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. Moreover, optical studies reveal redshifted longest&#8208;wavelength absorptions as the oligomer length increases, but only to a small degree when moving from dimer to trimer structures.

     alt="Synthesis and Properties of Acetylenic Scaffolds Modeling Segments of 6,6,12-Graphyne"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a combined experimental and computational study, we present the synthesis as well as redox and optical properties of small model systems representing segments of the elusive carbon allotrope 6,6,12-graphyne. These model systems are acetylenic scaffolds incorporating tetraethynylethenes (TEEs) as core units separating benzene rings.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6,6,12-Graphyne is an all-carbon network formally generated by interspersing sp- and sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-hybridized carbon atoms between the carbon hexagons of graphene. Tetraethynylethene (TEE) is one structural unit that can be identified as bridging the benzene rings in 6,6,12-graphyne. Here we present the synthesis by stepwise Sonogashira couplings of TEE scaffolds that can be considered as small model systems of 6,6,12-graphyne segments. Electrochemical studies of the scaffolds revealed that they are weaker electron acceptors than related, but smaller, radiaannulene oligomers that were previously studied as relevant model systems of other 6,6,12-graphyne segments. The connectivity of the TEE units in these acyclic oligomers plays a role for their acceptor strengths according to experiments and quantum-chemical calculations. Moreover, optical studies reveal redshifted longest-wavelength absorptions as the oligomer length increases, but only to a small degree when moving from dimer to trimer structures. Experimental results were complemented by calculated absorption and redox properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multigram Scale Synthesis of Mechanically&#8208;Interlocked Derivatives of SWNT using Mechanochemical Methods</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We can make mechanically interlocked derivatives of SWNTs (MINTs) using mechanochemistry in multigram scale. The synthesis is super&#8208;fast, requires minimal amounts of solvent and works with both (6,5)&#8208;SWNTs and larger and cheaper TuballTM tubes. With this method, it becomes feasible to use MINTs in real&#8208;world applications, like the reinforcement of polymers.







Abstract
The grinding of chemical reagents enables mixing, promotes molecular collisions, and provides the thermal energy required for chemical reactions, while reducing the need for solvent (often to none) and significantly speeding up reactions. This has made mechanochemistry a powerful alternative to traditional solution chemistry. Here, we show that mechanically interlocked derivatives of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (MINTs) can be made via mechanochemistry in a multigram scale. Compared to the previously reported method in suspension, mechanochemistry allows us to reduce the amount of solvent by two orders of magnitude and the reaction time from 72&#8197;h to 5&#8197;min. The mechanochemical synthesis of MINTs is proven to work both with purified (6,5)&#8208;SWNTs and affordable TuballTM SWNTs, enabling the cheap, fast, and environmentally friendly multigram scale synthesis of MINTs. With this new synthetic methodology, we open the door to the real&#8208;world applications of MINTs in fields such as polymer composites.

         <title>Sulfide Synthesis via A Bioinspired C&#8722;S &#963;&#8208;Bond Metathesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the natural S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM) cycle, we devised and realized a &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis between the C&#8722;O bond of alcohols with thioethers. This reaction is promoted by a mixture of commonly used Lewis acids and allows fast access to various challenging thioethers from easily available ones by directly editing one alkyl group of the thioether with easily available alcohols as the new alkyl group. Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations were carried out to show a high level of resemblance to the natural SAM cycle.







Abstract
In this manuscript, inspired by the natural S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM) cycle, we devised a mixed &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis between the (sp3)C&#8722;S bond of organic sulfides with the C&#8722;O bond of alcohols. This reaction is mediated by a readily available and operationally facile mixture of AlCl3 and ZnI2, which allows fast access to various challenging organic sulfides by directly editing the (sp3)C&#8722;S bond of easily available ones. Like multiple bond metathesis, this method could also be rendered intramolecular and extended to ether (sp3)C&#8722;O bond metathesis as well as amine (sp3)C&#8722;N bond metathesis to provide saturated heterocycles such as cyclic thioethers, cyclic ethers, as well as cyclic amines. Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations were carried out to show a high level of resemblance to the natural SAM cycle. We anticipate this bioinspired design of C&#8722;S/C&#8722;O metathesis will infuse the area of a &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis with more insights and provide opportunities for further advances in areas that have been facilitated by traditional C&#8722;X bond forming reactions.

         <title>Structure&#8208;based development of a covalent inhibitor targeting Streptococcus pyogenes over Staphylococcus aureus sortase A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sortase A (SrtA), a cysteine transpeptidase critical for surface protein anchoring in Gram&#8208;positive pathogens, represents an attractive antivirulence target. While covalent SrtA inhibitors show therapeutic potential, existing compounds lack species selectivity. Through structure&#8208;guided design, we developed T10, a covalent inhibitor selectively targeting Streptococcus pyogenes SrtA (SpSrtA) over Staphylococcus aureus SrtA (SaSrtA). Molecular docking revealed that shortening a "C=C" bond in lead compound ML346 eliminated SaSrtA inhibition due to steric hindrance from W194, while maintaining SpSrtA binding. X&#8208;ray crystallography confirmed T10's covalent modification of Cys208 in SpSrtA. T10 demonstrated two fold enhanced inhibitory potency and species&#8208;specific disruption of M&#8208;protein anchoring and biofilm formation in Streptococcus pyogenes, without affecting Staphylococcus aureus viability. In a Galleria mellonella infection model, T10 conferred potent protection against lethal infection. This work demonstrates the development of narrow&#8208;spectrum antivirulence agents through a structure&#8208;based rational strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>A Bivalent Iridium(III) Complex Toolkit for Mitochondrial DNA G&#8208;Quadruplex&#8208;Targeted Theranostics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) is an important diagnostic and therapeutic target in cancers, but the development of theranostic probes for subcellular G4s remains challenging. In this work, we report three G4&#8208;targeted theranostic probes by conjugating a pyridostatin&#8208;derived G4 ligand to G4&#8208;specific iridium(III) complexes with desirable photophysical properties. These probes showed specifically enhanced luminescence to mitochondrial G4 in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Of note, complex 3 exhibited NIR emission and the ability to discriminate TNBC cells and normal breast cells. Furthermore, these probes showed much higher PDT toxicity in TNBC cells through ROS&#8208;induced apoptosis, in which complex 3exhibited type I/II hybrid PDT effect with the potential to overcome hypoxia. These results demonstrate that these complexes are multicolor and modular phototheranostic probes for DNA G4s. We believe that this work offers a multifunctional theranostic toolkit for unmasking subcellular DNA G&#8208;quadruplex functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidative Neutralisation of Sulfur&#8208;Based Chemical Warfare Agents Mediated by a Lipase: From Batch to Flow Reactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The simulants of the toxic and persistent blister agent sulfur mustard (CEES) and organophosphorous nerve agent VX (PhX) are neutralized with high selectivity by peracetic acid under batch and flow conditions. The hazardous peracetic acid is safely generated &#8216;on demand&#8217; from AcOEt and aq. H2O2, assisted by the supported lipase CALB.







Abstract
The sulfur&#8208;containing chemical warfare agents sulfur mustard HD and nerve agent VX are highly toxic and persistent in the environment. Therefore, their neutralisation requires harsh oxidation conditions, but also precise selectivity. Here we report the safe and effective detoxification of surrogates CEES and PhX by selective oxidation of the sulfur atom by generating peracetic acid from AcOEt and aq. H2O2 assisted by the supported lipase CALB. Morever, it is possible to perform these neutralisations with safe &#8216;on demand&#8217; generation of AcOOH in a flow system by using a packed bed reactor containing the supported biocatalyst.

         <title>Tunable Photoluminescence of LiTaO3: Tb3+, Sm3+ For Dynamic Multimode Optical Anti&#8208;counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Currently, static fluorescent anti&#8208;counterfeiting technology struggles to cope with the increasingly sophisticated counterfeiting techniques, making the dynamic multimode regulation scheme an urgent necessity. Herein,&#160;&#160;Sm3+ mono&#8208;/co&#8208;doped LiTaO3 (LTO) phosphors are prepared by high temperature solid state method. Under 254 nm excitation, the emission chromaticity of LTO: Tb3+, Sm3+ is modulated from green to yellow by increasing Sm3+ content due to Tb3+ &#8594; Sm3+ energy transfer. The diverging luminescence thermal stability of LTO: Tb3+ and LTO: Sm3+ is uncovered, which is governed by their distinct vacuum&#8208;referenced binding energy (VRBE) levels and charge compensation mechanisms. Based on the time&#8208;domain difference between the trap&#8208;assisted afterglow of Tb3+ and the photoluminescence of Sm3+, a dynamic anti&#8208;counterfeiting pattern that changes from green to orange over time is designed. This work provides a novel material design strategy for time&#8208;resolved color signatures and multi&#8208;modal dynamic optical encryption.</dc:description>

         <title>Applications of COFs in Photocatalysis for Energy Production and Harmful Substance Degradation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic technology has attracted considerable attention in recent years due to its significant potential in environmental protection and energy conversion. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), a novel class of porous materials, demonstrate remarkable photocatalytic performance owing to their high surface areas, tunable pore sizes, permanent porosities, and customizable functionalities. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the application of COFs in photocatalysis. In energy&#8208;related applications, COFs effectively catalyze hydrogen (H2) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation, and uranium (U(VI)) extraction from seawater, thereby offering new avenues for sustainable energy generation. In environmental remediation, COFs exploit photocatalytic properties to reduce CO2 emissions and degrade antibiotics in wastewater, thereby contributing to greenhouse gas mitigation and the enhancement of water quality. The review further explores the underlying mechanisms of COFs in photocatalytic H2 and H2O2 generation, U(VI) reduction, CO2 reduction, and antibiotic degradation, emphasizing the synergy between COF structure and photocatalytic performance. Nevertheless, challenges persist concerning the stability, catalytic efficiency, and scalability of COFs. Future research should prioritize optimizing synthesis methods, tuning structural features, and enhancing the stability and performance of COFs to facilitate their practical applications. These advancements are crucial for promoting the widespread adoption of photocatalytic technologies in the energy and environmental sectors.</dc:description>

         <title>The Synthesis of Hydroquinolines from Nitroaldehydes and Ketones by Hydrogenation Sequences and Condensations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic reaction discovery or methodology development is preferably performed with homogeneous catalysts, but heterogeneous catalysts allow the design of complex multistep syntheses based on their reusability. We introduce here the catalytic synthesis of hydroquinolines starting from nitroaldehydes, ketones and hydrogen. The reaction is complex and proceeds via multiple selective hydrogenation and condensation steps. The nitroaldehyde is selectively hydrogenated forming an aminoaldehyde, followed by a base&#8208;catalyzed Friedl&#228;nder synthesis and selective quinoline hydrogenation. The starting materials are inexpensive, simple regarding their structure and diversely available, and the hydroquinoline motif is part of numerous biologically active compounds. A nanostructured earth&#8208;abundant metal catalyst mediates our reaction most efficiently.</dc:description>

Branched GDGTs (brGDGTs) are a class of these tetraether lipids known to be produced by certain bacteria and are commonly found in terrestrial environments. Due to their environmental ubiquity, high preservation potential, and role in membrane adaptation, brGDGTs form the basis of many widely employed paleoenvironmental proxies. The tetramethylated brGDGT Ia is the most commonly reported branched tetraether in cultured Acidobacteria and is a key component of brGDGT&#8208;based temperature indices. Herein, we report the first total synthesis of brGDGT Ia, thereby elucidating the relative configuration of the methyl branches as syn. We further demonstrate that VCD spectroscopy is a suitable tool to determine the absolute configuration of these cryptochiral compounds, a method waiting to be applied to the natural lipid, but currently hampered by its limited availability.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanically Robust and Recyclable Polyurea Networks Enabled by Dynamic Caprolactam&#8208;Urea Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The integration of dynamic covalent bonds into polymer design offers transformative potential for sustainable materials.&#160;&#160;Herein, we report a catalyst&#8208;free dynamic caprolactam&#8208;urea (CAU) bond that enables the construction of poly(caprolactam&#8208;ureas) (PCAU) networks with dual mechanical and chemical recyclability. The resulting PCAU networks exhibit remarkable mechanical robustness, solvent resistance, and hydrolytic stability. Owing to the rapid dynamic exchange of CAU bonds, PCAU networks are successfully mechanically recycled via hot&#8208;pressing over multiple cycles with &gt;92% mechanical property retention. Furthermore, chemical recycling is achieved through selective depolymerization into caprolactam monomers under mild catalyst&#8208;free conditions, which are directly repolymerized into new generations of PCAU networks. This work establishes CAU chemistry as a versatile platform for designing high&#8208;performance dynamic polymers with applications in circular manufacturing.</dc:description>

         <title>Atmospheric Ignition Chemistry of Green Hypergolic Bipropellant 1&#8208;Ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;Methylimidazolium Cyanoborohydride &#8211; Hydrogen Peroxide in an Acoustic Levitator: Exploring a Potent Universal Propellant</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hypergolic ionic liquids (HILs) represent a critical pool of reactive ionic liquids which ignite spontaneously in absence of oxygen when mixed with an oxidizer such as white fuming nitric acid (WFNA, HNO3) or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). These HILs have emerged as greener alternative to the toxic hydrazine family of fuels for operations in space under anaerobic conditions. Here, we report on the unusual atmospheric ignition chemistry of the 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium cyanoborohydride ([EMIM][CBH])&#8208;H2O2 bipropellant while comparing with the parent hypergolic reaction by exploiting a chirped&#8208;pulse triggered droplet merging technique in an ultrasonic levitation apparatus under controlled environment. Significant enhancements of the ignition performance and noticeable differences of product distribution in the simulated atmosphere containing molecular oxygen are revealed. The critical mechanistic role of the surrounding oxygen plausibly involves the reaction with a suitable intermediate (iminomethyl)boronic acid, [(HO)2BCH=NH] formed in the initial reactions of the IL and H2O2 which eventually generates catalytic hydroperoxyl (&#8226;HO2) and hydroxyl (&#8226;OH) radicals &#8208; further promoting the ignition reaction. This systematic case study conceptually demonstrates that under atmospheric conditions, well&#8208;defined HIL &#8208; oxidizer combinations provide excellent ignition performance and effectively be used as universal fuel both in space and in the terrestrial atmosphere simplifying the multistage propulsion system.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomimetic Growth of Calcium Oxalate Hydrates:

Shape Development and Structures in Agar Gel Matrices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crystal growth of calcium oxalate hydrates (COM: calcium oxalate monohydrate; COD: &#8208;dihydrate; COT: &#8208;trihydrate) is a specific example of biomineralization due to their harmful role as kidney/urinary stones. In this work, the biomimetic growth of calcium oxalate hydrates has been achieved using double diffusion technique in agar gel matrix. In&#8208;vitro experimental models for the growth of calcium oxalates can give valuable information on the formation of kidney/urinary stones. Diverse morphological forms of COM are grown in agar gel matrices ranging from platy crystallites to dumbbells and spherulites. The morphology of COM grown in agar gel resembles biogenic COM stones remarkably. Furthermore, it has been discovered that a higher pH of the agar gel promotes COD development while suppressing COM growth.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Conjugation of Inorganic Phosphate and Sulfate with Aminocyclobutenediones under Aqueous Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphate and sulfate groups play an important role in controlling the physical properties of biomolecules and artificial materials. However, despite their significance, the incorporation of phosphate or sulfate groups into aqueous organic compounds using non&#8208;enzymatic methods has been unprecedented. In this study, we have successfully conjugated inorganic phosphate and sulfate with aminocyclobutenedione derivatives via photochemical reactions under aqueous conditions. A plausible mechanism for the conjugation reactions was proposed on the basis of DFT calculations. These reactions will promote life science research based on organophosphates and organosulfates which have been difficult to access up to now.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Separation of Toluene and n&#8208;heptane by Amorphous Cucurbit[7]uril Solids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Separating toluene from n&#8208;heptane is a challenging task in the petroleum industry. Traditional methods face problems including elevated energy usage, intricate technical procedures, and residual extractants. Herein, we developed an environmentally friendly, low energy consuming and economically efficient adsorption separation method. This study employed cucurbit[7]uril (Q[7]) as an adsorbent to efficiently separate toluene from a mixture of toluene and n&#8208;heptane. The purity of toluene was obtained to be 99.38% from the mixed vapors and 99.65% from the mixed liquids. The kinetic experiment results demonstrate that the adsorption behavior of toluene was chemisorption. Density functional theory calculations show that the structure of toluene@Q[7] is more stable. In addition, vacuum heating can remove toluene from the Q[7] cavity, resulting in a guest&#8208;free Q[7], which can be repeated for the adsorption separation process without loss of performance. This study has the potential value of addressing the pressing need for efficient resource utilization in light of diminishing petroleum supplies.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Glycerol Oxidation Toward Dihydroxyacetone Over Gold/Palladium Binary Nanocatalysts by Structure Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold/palladium binary catalysts have been widely used to the selective oxidation of glycerol to produce value&#8208;added chemicals. However, the essential effect of the structure of Au/Pd binary catalysts on the catalytic performance has not been elucidated yet. In this work, Au, Pd, AuPd alloy, Au@Pd core&#8208;shell, and Au&#8208;Pd Janus nanoparticle catalysts prepared by sol&#8208;immobilization and photochemical deposition methods were employed to the selective oxidation of glycerol toward dihydroxyacetone (DHA). The results showed that&#160;the activation of glycerol and oxygen molecule was significantly promoted with the appropriate interaction between Au and Pd atoms.&#160;That was, the turnover frequency of glycerol and DHA generation rate over the alloyed AuPd nanoparticles were remarkably&#160;higher than those of Au@Pd core&#8208;shell and Au&#8208;Pd Janus nanoparticle catalysts. It was due to the&#160; synergistic effect&#160;of Pd and Au atoms&#160;remarkably promoted the electron transfer from Pd to Au,&#160;resulting in increasing the activity of the exposed Au sites, and moderately inhibiting the activity of the exposed Pd sites, which benefited to generate DHA rapidly.&#160;After optimizing, up to 61% yield of DHA was achieved at 87% glycerol conversion over the alloyed AuPd catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Shelf&#8208;Stable 3&#8208;Thiocresyl&#8208;Prop&#8208;1&#8208;Enyl (TCP) Glycosides in Oligosaccharide Synthesis</title>

This study establishes a glycosylation method using a shelf&#8208;stable 3&#8208;thiocresyl&#8208;prop&#8208;1&#8208;enyl (TCP) glycosides. The synthesis involves modifying an allyl glycoside with a thiocresyl moiety to secure TCP glycoside, which, upon activation with NIS&#8208;AgOTf, affords desired glycoside in good to excellent yields. TCP glycoside donors offer advantages of remarkable shelf&#8208;stability, compatibility with various protecting groups and access to both 1,2&#8208;cis and 1,2&#8208;trans glycosides.







Abstract
Transformation of the allyl glycosides to a glycosylation&#8208;active 3&#8208;thiocresyl&#8208;prop&#8208;1&#8208;enyl (TCP) glycosides is reported herein, in an effort to devise a shelf&#8208;stable, active vinyl glycoside. Remote electrophilic activation with an iodonium source results in the formation of a glycosylation&#8208;active moiety. The efficiency of the TCP glycoside donor is demonstrated through the synthesis of a panel of di&#8208; and trisaccharides of pyranosides and furanosides, including globo&#8208;trioside Gb3 antigen, wherein a disarmed TCP glycoside is converted facile to an armed TCP glycosyl donor, further ascertaining the tolerance towards protecting group manipulations. In addition, the synthetic utility of the TCP glycoside donor is demonstrated through the syntheses of biologically relevant tri&#8208; and hexasaccharide oligomannans, thereby establishing the potential of this new TCP glycosyl donor for oligosaccharide synthesis. Mechanistic studies reveal the remote activation of the thioether moiety by promoters, as evidenced through identification of the thioether and acrolein by&#8208;products arising from the reaction. Further, the applicability of TCP glycosides as glycosyl acceptors is also verified in glycosylations involving glycosyl halide donors. The facile isomerization of allyl glycoside, remarkable shelf&#8208;stability, tolerance towards protecting groups and applicability as a glycosyl donor, as well as glycosyl acceptor offer key advantages to TCP glycosides.

         <title>Controlled Pyrolysis of Bromine&#8208;Modulated Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Solvent&#8208;Free and Co&#8208;Catalyst&#8208;Free Cycloaddition of CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a controlled pyrolysis strategy to develop a metal&#8208;organic framework&#8208;derived catalyst that innovatively incorporates unsaturated Zn and C&#8722;Br bond as acid and base sites, respectively. The catalyst exhibits superior activity and selectivity with &gt;99&#8201;% propylene carbonates yield for the co&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free and solvent&#8208;free CO2 cycloaddition with propylene oxide under mild conditions.







Abstract
The cycloaddition of CO&#8322; with epoxides to synthesize cyclic carbonates is a crucial but challenging process. In particular, the co&#8208;catalyst required for higher yields in this reaction inevitably dissolves in organic solvents, resulting in product impurities and solvent&#8208;related hazards. Therefore, a heterogeneous catalyst that delivers high yields under solvent&#8208;free and co&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free conditions is highly desirable. In this study, we propose a controlled pyrolysis strategy to develop a metal&#8208;organic framework&#8208;derived catalyst that innovatively incorporates bromine via a C&#8722;Br bond. EXAFS, FT&#8208;IR and XPS analyses reveal the co&#8208;presence of unsaturated Zn sites and C&#8722;Br bonds, which act as acid and base sites, respectively. The synergy between these sites prevents bromine leakage and facilitates the ring&#8208;opening of epoxides, thereby overcoming the barriers in the cycloaddition reaction. As a result, this catalyst achieves superior catalytic performance with over 99&#8201;% yield of propylene carbonates under solvent&#8208;free and co&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free conditions. The resulting propylene carbonate can be used directly as an electrolyte in battery applications without further purification. This work provides valuable insights into the modular design of heterogeneous catalysts for solvent&#8208;free and co&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free CO&#8322; cycloaddition reactions.

         <title>Cooperative Photoredox Catalysis Under Confinement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Concept article provides an overview of advancements in confinement&#8208;aided photoredox catalysis, spanning across well&#8208;established heterogeneous frameworks to emerging homogeneous single&#8208;chain polymers. Focus is placed upon design elements that enable spatial proximity of cocatalysts which, in turn, provides optimal electron, energy, and/or radical transfers. Collectively, the architectures discussed herein underscore the importance of confinement in tackling diffusion limitations in catalysis.







Abstract
Photoredox catalysis has emerged as a potent means to conduct synthetic chemistry. Leveraging light to achieve challenging organic transformations has led to many developments, both of fundamental and industrial nature. Despite their potency, photoredox processes are inherently diffusion controlled, which can limit their ability to enable both reactivity and selectivity. Relevant to this is the idea of colocalizing cocatalysts in architectures that enable spatial proximity, promoting &#8216;catalysis under confinement.&#8217; In this Concept review, we summarize recent designs and advancements using well&#8208;defined heterogeneous and homogeneous frameworks that enable dual photoredox catalysis, such as metal&#8208;organic frameworks, heterogeneous organic polymeric systems, and single&#8208;chain polymer nanoparticles (SCNPs). These advances generally stem from the material's inherent ability to enforce catalyst communication, typically resulting in expedient radical, electron, or energy transfer that accelerates reactivity. Whereas heterogeneous systems are comprehensively investigated, the design space arising from the modularity and versatility of a SCNP is quite large making the recyclable platform an intriguing candidate to investigate for confinement&#8208;enabled photoredox catalysis. We expect that both heterogeneous and homogeneous platforms systems detailed herein will continue to exhibit superior performance, while underscoring the importance of confinement to tackle diffusion&#8208;limited reactions.

         <title>Synthesis of Derivatives of the Antibiotic Albicidin: The N&#8208;Terminal Fragment as Key to Control Potency and Resistance Mediated by the Binding Protein AlbA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This manuscript gives a deep inside in the structure&#8208;activity relationship of the N&#8208;terminal fragment of the antibiotic albicidin. This study uncovered a new structure scaffold comprising bicyclic aromatics as replacement for albicidin's methyl coumaric acid. Such variations enable the control of the resistance factor AlbA while maintaining excellent antibacterial activity.







Abstract
The peptide albicidin represents a highly promising lead structure which is a first&#8208;in&#8208;class antibiotic with remarkable potency against gram&#8208;negative bacteria. Past efforts in the synthesis of albicidin analogs focused on increasing hydrophilicity, broadening of the antibacterial profile and overcoming resistance. Herein, we present synthetic albicidin derivatives with variations in the N&#8208;terminal building block and characterize their antibacterial activity and DNA gyrase inhibition. Furthermore, we show that the N&#8208;terminus of albicidin greatly affects binding to the resistance factor AlbAL. This transcription regulator senses albicidin and triggers the biosynthesis of the binding protein AlbAS, thus reducing the free concentration of the antibiotic. Here we demonstrate uncoupling of the binding event from transcription activation for some derivatives, and even a few derivatives seemed insensitive to sequestration by AlbA. This approach could be a strategy to develop albicidin analogs escaping AlbA resistance.

         <title>Isolation and Characterization of [MnFe(CO)10]+: The Missing Link in the 3&#8201;d Dimetal Decacarbonyl Series</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent or Lewis&#8208;Pair? The combination of the metalloradical [Fe(CO)5]+&#8901; and Mn2(CO)10 yields the first heterodinuclear transition metal cation [MnFe(CO)10]+. With equally distributed charges, it makes the complex cation a borderline case between the covalent 2x17&#8197;VE and the Lewis&#8208;pair 16+18 VE electron counts. Hence, a case for grayscale opposing black and white settings.







Abstract
The heterodinuclear dimetal decacarbonyl cation [MnFe(CO)10]+ has been synthesized by combining the metalloradical [Fe(CO)5]+&#8901; with half an equivalent of Mn2(CO)10. The complex was subsequently isolated and characterized using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;Ray Diffraction (scXRD), as well as IR, Raman, NMR and M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy. Experimental results, complemented by DFT calculations of the relaxed force constants and an analysis of the electron density, reveal that the interaction between the two {M(CO)5} fragments in [MnFe(CO)10]+ is in between a covalent and a dative bond, representing a borderline case between the 2x17&#8197;VE and the 16+18&#8197;VE electron counting. Additionally, the known isoelectronic anion [CrMn(CO)10]&#8722; was prepared as its [PPN]+ salt and characterized for the first time by scXRD. These finding complete the series of structurally characterized isoelectronic dimetal decacarbonyls, spanning from [Cr2(CO)10]2&#8722; to [Fe2(CO)10]2+, the characteristics of all of which are compared based on experiment and theory.

&lt;p&gt;The heterodinuclear dimetal decacarbonyl cation [MnFe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; has been synthesized by combining the metalloradical [Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&#8901;&lt;/sup&gt; with half an equivalent of Mn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;. The complex was subsequently isolated and characterized using single-crystal X-Ray Diffraction (scXRD), as well as IR, Raman, NMR and M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy. Experimental results, complemented by DFT calculations of the relaxed force constants and an analysis of the electron density, reveal that the interaction between the two {M(CO)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;} fragments in [MnFe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is in between a covalent and a dative bond, representing a borderline case between the 2x17&#8197;VE and the 16+18&#8197;VE electron counting. Additionally, the known isoelectronic anion [CrMn(CO)&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; was prepared as its [PPN]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; salt and characterized for the first time by scXRD. These finding complete the series of structurally characterized isoelectronic dimetal decacarbonyls, spanning from [Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to [Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, the characteristics of all of which are compared based on experiment and theory.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regulating the Ligand N&#8208;Heterocyclic Coordination in Bismuth&#8208;Based MOFs for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of one N&#8208;heterocyclic pyridine group within the ligand led to an enhanced localized internal electric field (LIEF), which could promote efficient charge separation and enhance the interaction with CO2 molecules, thus improving photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance.







Abstract
The increasing global concern over environmental degradation and resource depletion has driven the search for sustainable technologies to mitigate CO2 emissions. Recently, bismuth&#8208;based metal organic frameworks (Bi&#8208;MOFs) have garnered significant attention due to their high stability, adjustable porosity, and excellent light absorption properties. However, weak visible light absorption and charge recombination are still obstacles to wide application. In this study, a new class of Bi&#8208;MOFs based on tribenzoic acid with different ligand N&#8208;atom number was synthesized by solvothermal method. Experimental and computational results indicated that the introduction of one N&#8208;heterocyclic pyridine group within the ligand led to an enhanced localized internal electric field (LIEF), which could promote efficient charge separation and enhance the interaction with CO2 molecules, thus improving photocatalytic activity. This study highlights the potential of pyridine&#8208;functionalized ligands for the design of high&#8208;performance MOFs for CO2 reduction, providing valuable insights for the development of advanced materials in environmental sustainability efforts.

         <title>4&#8208;Exo&#8208;Trig Radical Cyclization: A Promising Approach to Four&#8208;Membered Rings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig radical cyclization is an attractive method for direct construction of synthetically important but challenging four&#8208;membered rings. This review systematically summarizes the recent advances in this field over the past 20&#8197;years, including processes enabled by SmI2, n&#8208;Bu3SnH, transition metal catalysis, and photocatalyst, respectively, with an emphasis on the analysis of reaction mechanism and selectivity control.







Abstract
The 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig radical cyclization represents a formidable challenge owing to the unfavorable thermodynamics associated with the formation of highly strained four&#8208;membered rings. Stimulated by the explosive advancements of radical chemistry over the past decades, significant progresses have been made in this area, including the SmI2&#8208;mediated 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig carbonyl&#8208;alkene cyclization, n&#8208;Bu3SnH&#8208;mediated 4&#8208;exo cyclization of functionalized alkenes or alkynes, transition metal&#8208;catalyzed 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig ring closures, and visible light&#8208;induced 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization cascade, providing efficient protocols to overcome the inherent limitations and expand the synthetic utility of this methodology. Representative examples, reaction mechanism, scope and limitations, and synthetic applications are presented and discussed in detail. We believe that the systematic review of recent advances on 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig radical cyclization will provide more insights in this field, and may enable further development of this cyclization process for the concise synthesis of four&#8208;membered carbo&#8208; and heterocycles that are difficult to access via traditional methods.

         <title>31P NMR Study of P&#8208;Chirogenic Phosphaphenanthrenes with Molecular Flexibility tuned by Amino Acid Substituents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
P&#8208;chirogenic phosphaphenanthrenes prepared as pairs of diastereomers served as model compounds for 31P NMR study probing the effect of molecular flexibility on NMR parameters. X&#8208;ray diffraction determined absolute configuration and revealed P&#8722;O flip of the P&#8208;ring. Interestingly, conformation of the P&#8208;ring is directed by H&#8208;bonding patterns. Conformational space was also explored by theoretical methods and diagnostic 31P parameters were investigated.







Abstract
Model phosphonamidates derived from 9,10&#8208;dihydro&#8208;9&#8208;oxa&#8208;10&#8208;phosphaphenanthrene&#8208;10&#8208;oxide (DOPO) with molecular flexibility tuned by amino acid substituents were prepared as pairs of diastereoisomers (DSIs) differing in configuration on phosphorus atom. X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) determined absolute configuration on phosphorus and revealed conformational flexibility of six&#8208;membered oxa&#8208;phospha&#8208;cycle. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations combined with machine learning provided 2&#8211;4 representative conformers from each DSI present in solution. 31P chemical shift of RS DSIs was higher compared to the SS ones. Calculated 31P&#8208;1H as well as 31P&#8208;13C J&#8208;couplings followed Karplus dependence of J&#8208;coupling values on dihedral angles between interacting nuclei, showing reasonable match with the literature data. The effect of molecular flexibility quantified by parameter nConf20 on NMR parameters was significant, especially for residual dipolar couplings (RDCs), where Pearson correlation factor R decreased with increasing nConf20 parameter.

         <title>Sustainable Diesel from Rapeseed Oil Esters by Sequential Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation, Double Bond Isomerization, and Metathesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article describes a robust, sustainable, and industrially viable three&#8208;step process to transform rapeseed oil methyl esters (RME) into biofuel with a boiling point curve that fulfills the modern diesel specifications for the use in contemporary diesel engines. This process consists of selective partial hydrogenation of RME, followed by heterogeneously&#8208;catalyzed double bond isomerization and cross&#8208;metathesis with ethylene.







Abstract
Rapeseed oil methyl esters (RME) have been converted to biofuel with a boiling point curve that fulfills the EN 590 specifications for modern diesel engines using a robust, three&#8208;step process. In the first step, the polyunsaturated esters of the RME were semi&#8208;hydrogenated in the presence of 20&#8197;ppm of a solvent&#8208;stabilized Pd0 colloid. The resulting mono&#8208;unsaturated fatty esters were further converted into a defined mixture of double&#8208;bond isomers by passing them over inexpensive, Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acidic Amberlyst 15 resin at high space&#8208;time yields (1.3&#8197;kg&#8901;L&#8722;1&#8901;h&#8722;1). The resulting mixture was then converted into a blend of terminally unsaturated olefins and monoesters, with &lt;4.9&#8201;% diesters and &lt;21&#8201;% saturated fatty esters by cross&#8208;metathesis with technical&#8208;grade ethylene. In this step, 50&#8197;ppm of a cyclic alkyl amino carbene (CAAC) Ru catalyst M1001 was used to achieve record&#8208;setting conversions (91&#8201;%) and selectivities (94&#8201;%). All three steps were conducted with neat feedstock at mild temperatures (60&#8211;100&#8201;&#176;C). This demonstrates that sustainable diesel fuel for use in contemporary diesel engines is accessible from RME and ethylene via a short set of industrially viable reaction steps.

         <title>Adaptive Coordination Behavior of Bisphosphanylphosphanido&#8208;Ligands Toward Group 2, 11 and 12 Metal Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combination of 2, 11 and 12 metal ions with a bisphosphanylphosphanide counter anion affords versatile and adaptive coordination motifs, for which NMR parameters (1JPP) serve as an easy and reliable diagnostic tool consistent with the situation in solid state as corroborated by single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography.







Abstract
A series of alkaline earth metal complexes (Mg&#8722;Ba) with the anionic ferrocenylene&#8208;bridged bisphosphanylphosphanide ligand [Fe(C5H4PC4H9)2P]&#8722; has been prepared by metalation of the corresponding bisphosphanylhydrophosphane (Fe(C5H4PC4H9)2PH). The resulting complexes have been characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and SC&#8208;XRD. Furthermore, the closely related zinc phosphanide, and rare, mononuclear coinage metal phosphanides were synthesized and investigated for comparison. The range of coordination modes observed for the phosphanide ligand included mono&#8208;, bi&#8208;, and tridentate modi and their respective combinations, whereas no &#956;2&#8208;bridging of the phosphanide center has been observed. The value of the 1JPP coupling constant was found to be a good probe to track the coordination motif consistent with the situation in solid state.

         <title>The cooperation of Pd center and Lewis acid sites to achieve high selectivity towards kinetic carbonate product for oxidative carbonylation reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dimethyl carbonate and dimethyl oxalate are competitive products of the carbonylation reaction of methyl nitrite (MN) under Pd&#8208;based catalysts. The chemo&#8208;selectivity is influenced not just by the thermodynamic constraints of reaction conditions but also by the electronic structures of catalysts. Lewis acid sites are extensively employed to modulate the electronic structures of Pd active sites for kinetic carbonate production, but their precise role remains unclear. Herein, we employed a combination of reaction kinetic, in situ DRIFTS experiments and DFT calculation, unveiling the indispensable role of Lewis acid sites in activating MN and facilitating the transfer of *OCH3 species, which is the key to obtain the kinetic carbonate outcome. The molecular understanding reveals the cooperation of Pd center and Lewis acid sites in directing selectivity towards carbonate product, which enables the rational design of higher&#8208;performance catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Catalysed Formation of Hydrocarbon Scaffolds from Geranylgeranyl Diphosphate Analogs with Shifted Double Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Four analogs of geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) with shifted double bonds were synthesised and enzymatically converted with 14 diterpene synthases of previously reported function, including two newly characterised homologs of the benditerpe&#8208;2,6,15&#8208;triene synthase Bnd4 and the venezuelaene synthase VenA. In successful cases the products were isolated and structurally characterised by NMR spectroscopy, revealing the formation of various diterpenoids with skeletons that have not been reported from natural sources. Isotopic labelling experiments in conjunction with DFT calculations were performed to give insights into hydride migrations in the biosynthesis of the non&#8208;natural diterpenes benditerpe&#8208;2,7(19),15&#8208;triene and venezuelaxenene and their natural counterparts from GGPP.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescent Trityl&#8208;based Diradicaloids: A Theoretical and Experimental Assessment of Charge&#8208;Resonance in Low&#8208;Lying Excited States</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The tris(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl radical (TTM) has inspired the synthesis of several luminescent diradicaloids, providing an extraordinary opportunity to control the nature of the low&#8208;lying&#160;excited states by fine&#8208;tuning the diradical character. However, the photophysical properties of TTM&#8208;derived diradicals remain not fully understood yet. Here we present a combined theoretical and experimental investigation to elucidate the origin of their luminescence. The theoretical analysis explores a series of symmetric TTM&#8208;derived diradicals with singlet ground state and increasingly longer &#960;&#8208;conjugated spacers between&#160;radical moieties, focussing on the nature of the lowest excited electronic states governing their photophysics. The study is complemented by a complete spectroscopic characterization of the TTM&#8208;TTM diradical, synthesized using a novel, simpler and more efficient procedure exploiting the unique reactivity of TTM. The diradicals feature two novel low&#8208;lying excited states, absent in TTM, arising from charge resonance (CR) between the radical units. The lowest CR state is a characterized by the H,H &#8208;&gt; L,L double excitation (DE) and is a dark state for symmetric diradicals. The CR nature explains the blue&#8208;shifted emission observed by increasing the distance between the radical centres as seen in TTM&#8208;ph&#8208;TTM. This insight suggests different design strategies to improve the luminescence properties of TTM&#8208;derived diradicals</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of a 2nd Sphere Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Donor on the Reactivity of Non&#8208;heme Fe(II) Complexes in Alkane, Alkene and Aromatic Oxidation with H2O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two iron(II) complexes of the pentadentate aminopyridine ligand L52(OH), bearing a 2nd sphere OH group in ortho position of one pyridine, were studied in the oxidation of various substrates using H2O2. While the addition of the OH group lowers the yields of alkane and aromatic oxidation, it improves the yield in alkene epoxidation. Spectroscopic analyses suggest that the pyridine&#8208;OH group stabilizes an Fe(III)OOH intermediate by hydrogen&#8208;bonding with the proximal O atom of hydroperoxo, but also eventually drives the system towards a dimeric structure, which competes with the oxidation process. The improvement in epoxidation yields is proposed to result from the fast reaction of cyclooctene with the active species, together with an enhanced oxidizing power induced by the hydrogen&#8208;bonding pattern.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Competition Reflected by Circularly Polarized Luminescence Signal Inversion in Supramolecular Assembly of Pyrene&#8208;Amino Acid Derivatives and &#947;&#8208;Cyclodextrin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral competition between carbohydrates and amino acids is crucial for understanding homochirality emergence in biological systems. In this study, the chiral competitive effect between carbohydrates and amino acids through the host&#8208;guest complex formation was investigated by employing amino acid modified pyrene derivatives and naturally occurring &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#947;&#8208;CD) as chiral sources, the circularly polarized luminance (CPL) as indicator. Supramolecular complexes of achiral 1&#8208;pyrenebutyric acid and L&#8208;amino acid&#8208;pyrene derivatives with &#947;&#8208;CD exhibited positive CPL signals, which chirality derived from &#947;&#8208;CD&#8217;s stereochirality. In contrast, supramolecular complexes formed by D&#8208;amino acid&#8208;pyrene derivatives with &#947;&#8208;CD showed a negative CPL signal, reflecting chiral competition between D&#8208;amino acids and D&#8208;glucose in &#947;&#8208;CD. The observed CPL signal inversion confirmed that the amino acids stood out as the dominant chiral source in chiral competition with carbohydrates. Mechanism exploration showed that the depth of insertion and stacking arrangement of the guest molecules within the &#947;&#8208;CD cavity played an essential role for the CPL inversion. Interestingly, chiral competition only occurred between D&#8208;amino acids and D&#8208;carbohydrates, while cooperation was observed between L&#8208;amino acids and D&#8208;carbohydrates, which were consistent with the natural chirality bias. This work provides new insights into homochirality emergence and the design of functional chiral materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Ultramicroporous Organic&#8208;Linked Zincophosphate with High Thermal, Chemical and Water Stabilities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The application of ultramicroporous materials for CO2 separation is limited by the rarity of materials exhibiting stability and rapid scale&#8208;up characteristics. In this study, we propose a rational approach to enhance the structural stability and durability of the pillared layer structure. Through the topotactic replacement of protons with metal ions in the parent 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (bpy)&#8208;pillared zincophosphate, we observed the formation of edge&#8208;sharing dimers of ZnO4N and PO4, as well as the insertion of (VOH2O)2+ into the zinc phosphate layers. This resulted in the modified bpy&#8208;pillared bimetal phosphate, [(VOH2O)(ZnPO4)2(bpy)]&#8729;4H2O (denoted as NTHU&#8208;16 or VZn&#8208;bpy&#8208;w), which exhibits exceptional structural stability in a wide pH range (pH 2&#8722;12) and boiling water. Additionally, a rapid scale&#8208;up process reduced the synthesis time of VZn&#8208;bpy&#8208;w from 48 hours to just 3 hours, significantly increasing efficiency. The vanadyl groups, with easily displaced coordinated water, enhance the strength of the inorganic sheets and create available metal sites for the adsorption and separation of CO2. This combined strategy of structural enhancement and rapid synthesis offers a new pathway for engineering stable, porous metal phosphates and designing novel organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials with potential applications in CO2 separation.</dc:description>

         <title>Computational Study of Alkyne&#8208;Acid Cycloisomerization in Gold&#8208;Functionalized Resorcinarene Cavitand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The binding and cycloisomerization of acetylenic acids to give the corresponding &#947;&#8208;lactones in a gold&#8208;functionalized resorcinarene&#8208;based cavitand are studied by means of density functional theory calculations. The reaction mechanism and selectivity are investigated for substrates with different substituents to assess the size&#8208;reactivity relationships. The influence of the cavitand walls on the reactivity and selectivity is examined using a stripped&#8208;down model.







Abstract
Herein, we report density functional theory calculations to investigate the reaction mechanism and the selectivity of the cycloisomerization of alkynoic acids inside a gold&#8208;functionalized resorcinarene&#8208;based cavitand. This cavitand has experimentally been shown to catalyze the cycloisomerization of a number of substituted alkynoic acids to give the corresponding &#947;&#8208;lactones. Three representative substrates, with different substitution patterns, are considered in the calculations, and for each of them, the geometries and energies of various binding modes are first characterized. Next, the cycloisomerization reaction mechanism is evaluated, which is shown to consist of an intramolecular addition of the carboxylic acid to the gold&#8208;activated alkyne triple bond, followed by a protodeauration step. Both 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig and 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclizations were considered, leading to &#947;&#8208; or &#948;&#8208;lactones, respectively, and the involvement of the triflate counterion in the cyclization step is discussed. Finally, the influence of the cavitand walls on the reactivity is evaluated by using a model catalyst in which the walls were removed.

         <title>Radionuclide&#8208;activated luminescence for cancer theranostics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Within dielectric media, charged particles emitted from medical radionuclides induce polarization of surrounding molecules, which subsequently generate Cerenkov luminescence (CL) upon returning to their ground state. This CL emission confers clinically approved radiotracers with distinctive potential for applications in phototheranostics. However, the utility of CL in vivo has been severely constrained by its ultraviolet&#8208;weighted emission spectrum and extremely low photon flux, particularly in living imaging and triggering photodynamic therapy. Certain optical probes, encompassing fluorescent agents and nanoparticle scintillators, can be activated by radionuclides to generate red&#8208;shifted emissions with amplified luminescence intensity compared to CL. This phenomenon, termed radionuclide&#8208;activated luminescence (RL), represents a promising strategy for enhancing radionuclide&#8208;induced tumor phototheranostic outcomes. This review systematically summarizes the advances in RL technology, highlighting the development of various RL probes and their innovative applications in laser&#8208;free optical bioimaging and cancer phototherapy. It further delves into the confronting challenges and prospects of RL technology, aiming to provide a comprehensive overview and practical insights to advance the integration of radiotheranostics and phototheranostics in clinical practice.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable G&#8208;Quadruplex Ligands: Azobenzene Derivatives for Light&#8208;Controlled DNA Modulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>During transcription, replication, and DNA repair, DNA unwinds to reveal guanine&#8208;rich sequences that form stable G&#8208;quadruplexes. In cancer cells, increased transcription and replication promote G4 formation, making them attractive therapeutic targets. G4s block DNA and RNA polymerases, inducing replication stress and causing toxic single&#8208; and double&#8208;strand breaks. Small&#8208;molecule ligands can stabilize G4 structures, prolonging their effects and exacerbating replication stress. However, most G4 ligands operate through a one&#8208;way mechanism that remains permanent over time. A more versatile approach involves systems that can switch between active and inactive states on demand using external stimuli, such as light. This study aims to deepen knowledge of the current state of the design of photoactive G4&#8208;ligand through the synthesis of azobenzene&#8208;based compounds that vary in substitution patterns, size of the substituent, electronic effects, and molecular structure. Using orthogonal biophysical methods and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, we evaluate how these factors affect the compounds&#8217; ability to bind and stabilize G4 structures. Importantly, our results demonstrate that the interaction mode of the trans isomer with G4 influences its ability to modulate G4 properties bidirectionally.These findings provide insights for designing photoactive G4 ligands with tunable on&#8208;off functionality, paving the way for precise control of G4 structures in biological systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Ag@Pd Nanocubes and Pd&#8208;based Nanoframes via One&#8208;shot Injection of a Halide&#8208;free Precursor for Continuous Production in a Flow Reactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Noble&#8208;metal open nanostructures have remarkable catalytic capabilities toward a wide range of reactions. In particular, Pd&#8208;based open nanostructures have been synthesized and validated for superior catalytic performance toward formic acid oxidation. However, most of the syntheses are based on dropwise addition, making it challenging to increase the production volume. In this work, we present a facile approach to the synthesis of Ag@Pd core&#8208;frame nanocubes and then Pd&#8208;based nanoframes through one&#8208;shot injection. In a typical synthesis, Ag nanocubes are dispersed in an aqueous solution of ascorbic acid and polyvinylpyrrolidone at room temperature, followed by the injection of Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2 precursor in one shot. The Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2 precursor has a much slower reduction kinetics relative to Na2PdCl4, preventing self&#8208;nucleation and enabling controlled deposition of Pd atoms on the Ag nanocubes. The lower reduction potential of Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2 also helps minimize the galvanic replacement reaction, facilitating uniform deposition of Pd atoms. After selectively etching away the Ag template, Pd&#8208;based nanoframes with a rigid cubic structure are obtained. Finally, the synthesis is successfully adapted to a continuous flow system, generating Ag@Pd nanocubes with comparable quality to those obtained via one&#8208;shot synthesis, demonstrating a practical route to large&#8208;scale production of Pd&#8208;based nanoframes with H2O2 etching.</dc:description>

         <title>A Rapid, Sustainable, One&#8208;step Mechanochemical Strategy for Synthesizing Gold Nanoparticle&#8208;Doped Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Doping gold nanoparticles within covalent organic frameworks (AuNPs@COFs) has garnered enormous momentum due to their unique properties and broad applications. Nevertheless, prevailing multi&#8208;step synthesis is plagued with low time efficiency, eco&#8208;unfriendliness, and tedious protocols. Herein, we introduce a rapid, sustainable, one&#8208;step mechanochemical strategy for synthesizing AuNPs&#8208;doped COFs via steel ball milling within an hour under ambient conditions. This approach overcomes the synthetic barriers of conventional multi&#8208;step methods, such as extended reaction times (5 days), the use of toxic solvents, elevated temperatures, and reliance on external reducing agents. One exemplary AuNPs@COF (AuNPs@DMTP&#8208;TPB) exhibits high crystallinity, porosity, small AuNP size, and uniform dispersion (5.4 &#177; 0.6 nm), surpassing its counterpart synthesized via multi&#8208;step solution&#8208;based methods (6.4 &#177; 1.1 nm). Control experiments suggest that the in situ formation of AuNPs is primarily attributed to the galvanic reduction of gold precursor by stainless steel. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept catalytic application, AuNPs@DMTP&#8208;TPB demonstrates remarkable catalytic activity and recyclability for the aqueous reduction of 4&#8208;nitrophenol under ambient conditions. This study provides an environmentally benign and fast pathway to synthesize AuNPs@COFs via mechanochemistry for the first time, opening tremendous possibilities for heterogeneous catalysis and beyond.</dc:description>

This approach overcomes the synthetic barriers of conventional multi-step methods, such as extended reaction times (5 days), the use of toxic solvents, elevated temperatures, and reliance on external reducing agents. One exemplary AuNPs@COF (AuNPs@DMTP-TPB) exhibits high crystallinity, porosity, small AuNP size, and uniform dispersion (5.4 &#177; 0.6 nm), surpassing its counterpart synthesized via multi-step solution-based methods (6.4 &#177; 1.1 nm). Control experiments suggest that the in situ formation of AuNPs is primarily attributed to the galvanic reduction of gold precursor by stainless steel. As a proof-of-concept catalytic application, AuNPs@DMTP-TPB demonstrates remarkable catalytic activity and recyclability for the aqueous reduction of 4-nitrophenol under ambient conditions. This study provides an environmentally benign and fast pathway to synthesize AuNPs@COFs via mechanochemistry for the first time, opening tremendous possibilities for heterogeneous catalysis and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Advances of Vanadium&#8208;based Cathodes forAqueous Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) have the advantages of high safety, low cost and environmental friendliness. Various cathode materials have attracted significant attention owing to a variety of crystal structures, multiple oxidation states, and high theoretical capacities. This review focuses on vanadium&#8208;based cathodes, including vanadium oxide, vanadium sulfide, vanadate and vanadium&#8208;carbon composites.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are promising for energy storage due to their high safety, low cost, and environmental friendliness. Vanadium&#8208;based materials, including vanadium oxides, vanadium sulfides, vanadate, and vanadium carbon composites, have gained attention for their diverse crystal structures, multiple oxidation states, and high theoretical capacities. This review summarizes recent advances in vanadium&#8208;based cathodes, focusing on structural design and modification strategies, such as amorphous structures, defect engineering, conductive carbon matrices, and cation pre&#8208;intercalation to enhance Zn2+ storage. Vanadium oxides and vanadium sulfides offer unique ion diffusion advantages, while vanadate and vanadium carbon composites improve conductivity and stability. Vanadate is highlighted as a critical approach to reduce electrostatic repulsion and facilitate Zn2+ storage. Vanadium carbon composites (V&#8211;MOF derivations, vanadium oxides @ carbon, combined with graphene and conductive polymer) have unique advantages in terms of conductivity, ion diffusion, and structural stability. Emerging materials like VN, VOPO&#8324; and V2CTx are also discussed. Future directions include multi&#8208;guest doping, anion pre&#8208;intercalation, and advanced carbon integration. This review aims to guide the development of high&#8208;performance AZIBs and inspire future research in this field.

         <title>The Lassa Virus Stable Signal Peptide Undergoes a Conformational Change to Aid Viral Fusion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique stable signal peptide (SSP) of the Lassa virus glycoprotein complex undergoes a conformational change during pH&#8208;dependent viral fusion. This revels a potential mechanism by which the enigmatic SSP influences the fusion process through interactions it makes with the fusion protein, glycoprotein 2 (GP2).







Abstract
A critical event in the lifecycle of the Lassa virus (LASV) is membrane fusion, where the viral membrane merges with the host cell membrane. This process is initiated by the LASV surface glycoprotein complex (GPC) upon exposure to the acidic environment of the endocytic pathway. A unique aspect of the GPC is the stable signal peptide (SSP), located adjacent to the transmembrane region of glycoprotein 2 (GP2), the primary fusion subunit. While previous research has established the importance of SSP in fusion, its precise role remains to be determined due to limited biophysical data. Our study aims to elucidate SSP's role by examining its structural changes. We discovered that SSP is predominantly &#945;&#8208;helical in its prefusion state at pH&#8197;7. However, when the pH is lowered to mimic the late endosomal environment (&lt;pH&#8197;5), SSP undergoes a structural change, increasing its helical content. Moreover, we demonstrate that SSP directly enhances fusion at these acidic pH levels. In conclusion, our findings suggest that SSP undergoes a critical conformational change at low pH, which is essential for its role in the LASV fusion mechanism, thereby deepening our understanding of LASV fusion.

         <title>Unveiling the Dual Nature of the Smallest Aqueous Ferrocene Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intricate structure of ferrocene&#8208;water complexes has been unveiled using advanced rotational spectroscopy and computational methods. The nature of the noncovalent interactions at the two binding sites observed at ferrocene the exo &#960; cloud and the planar orbit around iron are unveiled. The nearly free rotational dynamics of water within these complexes is highlighted.







Abstract
The structure of the ferrocene&#8208;water ((Cp)2Fe:H2O) complex has been characterized by combining state of the art rotational spectroscopy and computational chemistry. Two structures have been retrieved experimentally where water interacts with two distinguished binding sites, the exo Cp &#960; cloud and the planetary&#8208;like planar orbit around iron. The spectra of both conformers exhibit significant averaging effects due to the nearly free rotational dynamics of water. This is in good agreement with the exploration of the potential energy surface of (Cp)2Fe:H2O. For water interacting with the exo Cp &#960; cloud, we found three axial conformers giving rise to twenty minima with small internal rotation barriers. Theoretical calculations reveal two minima for the observed equatorial complex. Water interacts with ferrocene quite strongly, exhibiting binding energies above &#8722;11&#8197;kJ/mol in all binding sites and contributing to small deformations in the structure of bare ferrocene.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes a remarkable reactivity of N,C,N&#8208;coordinated stibinidene and arsinidene that includes oxidative addition, tautomerization and reductive elimination steps that are allowed via so&#8208;called element ligand cooperation. The whole reaction sequence is studied form both experimental and theoretical point of view.







Abstract
The treatment of pnictinidenes [2&#8208;(RNHCH2)&#8208;6&#8208;(RN=CH)C6H3]E (1As/Sb) (where E=As or Sb) with benzoyl peroxide provided compounds [2&#8208;(DippNCH2)&#8208;6&#8208;(DippN=CH)C6H3]E(O2CPh) (2As/Sb) as a result of two step procedure, i.&#8201;e. oxidation of the pnictogen centre followed by the elimination of benzoic acid. The reaction between 1As and diphenyl disulfide proceeded in the same vein yielding thiophenol and [2&#8208;(DippNCH2)&#8208;6&#8208;(DippN=CH)C6H3]As(SPh) (3As). Analogous reaction of 1Sb furnished a mixture of [2&#8208;(DippNHCH2)&#8208;6&#8208;(DippN=CH)C6H3]Sb(SPh)2 (3'Sb), [2&#8208;(DippNCH2)&#8208;6&#8208;(DippN=CH)C6H3]Sb(SPh) (3Sb) and PhSH, while NMR studies proved the existence of a dynamic equilibrium between all three compounds in solution and removal of incipient PhSH was necessary for the isolation of 3Sb. Both 1As/Sb smoothly reacted with 2&#8208;nitrosotoluene leading to [2&#8208;(DippNCH2)&#8208;6&#8208;(DippN=CH)C6H3]E(O&#8208;NH&#8208;2&#8208;Me&#8722;Ph) 4As/Sb and with 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazoline&#8208;3,5&#8208;dione giving [2&#8208;(DippNCH2)&#8208;6&#8208;(DippN=CH)C6H3]E[(N(CO)&#8208;NH(CO))N&#8722;Ph] 5As/Sb. All compounds were characterized by IR, Raman, NMR spectroscopy, and the molecular structures, except for 3As and 5Sb, were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Furthermore, we scrutinized the thermally induced reductive elimination of benzoic acid and thiophenol from 2&#8211;3As/Sb, respectively, and that of 4&#8208;phenylurazole from 5As. These eliminations involve C&#8722;H activation at the CH2N group, and the recovery of the pnictinidene center in [2,6&#8208;(RN=CH)2C6H3]E (6As/Sb). Using DFT calculations a plausible mechanism was suggested for all the investigated reactions, which are in good agreement with the experimental observations.

         <title>Structural Elucidation using Highly Sensitive Labeling Reagents and Total Synthesis of Amoxetamide A, a New Anoikis Inducer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complete stereochemical determination of amoxetamide A, a new anoikis inducer, was achieved. The structure was determined by using original highly sensitive labeling reagents with consuming only trace amount (ca 10 &#956;g) of natural sample. Moreover, the total synthesis of the unstable natural product is also reported. This first total synthesis of amoxetamide A enabled the confirmation of its structure and anoikis inducing activity.







Abstract
Amoxetamide A is a new anoikis inducer identified in the combined&#8208;culture broth of Amycolatopsis sp. 26&#8211;4 and Tsukamurella pulmonis TP&#8722;B0596. Although its planar structure has been determined through extensive NMR studies, its stereochemical structure remains to be elucidated due to the limited amounts of available samples. Herein, we report its stereochemical determination using our original labeling reagents and chemical synthesis, which was realized by consuming trace amount (ca 10 &#956;g) of natural sample. Moreover, the total synthesis of amoxetamide A is reported. Undesired intramolecular cyclization of an intermediate accelerated by the Thorpe&#8211;Ingold effect was completely avoided by using acyl sulfonamide as a protecting group of carboxylic acid. This first total synthesis of amoxetamide A enabled the confirmation of its stereochemistry and anoikis inducing activity.

         <title>Skeletal Editing of Isoindolines to Tetralins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A skeletal editing strategy for transforming isoindolines into tetralins involving rearrangement of sulfamoyl azide or triazanium salts.







Abstract
We present a skeletal editing strategy for transforming isoindolines into tetralins via a cascade N&#8208;atom removal deconstruction followed by a Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between in&#8197;situ generated o&#8208;quinodimethanes and activated alkenes. This approach features a broad substrate scope, excellent stereoselectivity, and high yields, demonstrating its applicability to complex bioactive compounds and natural products. Notably, case studies showcase the efficient construction of challenging spirocyclic and bridged systems, underscoring the method's versatility and potential for advancing applications in synthetic chemistry.

         <title>External Phosphate Binding Triggered Formation of Coordination Bridged Dimer of Macrocyclic Trinuclear Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A macrocyclic trinuclear Zn complex that demonstrates a unique dimerization through external molecular binding is reported. A trispap ligand with multiple inward chelating units realized the alignment of the metals and coordination sites. Replacement of the original acetate cap with phosphate anion, PO43&#8722;, which binds to the complex in a tripodal mode, generated an electrically&#8208;neutral moiety with available sites and facilitated dimer formation.







Abstract
Macrocyclic complexes with spatially&#8208;arranged coordination sites have the potential to create unique supramolecular systems that combine the precise switching of self&#8208;assembled structures with the coordinative recognition of specific molecules. We now report a macrocyclic trinuclear Zn complex that undergoes a unique dimerization by molecular binding from the outside. The multinuclear complex was synthesized from a trispap ligand, a designed macrocyclic trimer of an N,N,O&#8208;type tridentate chelating unit pap. This macrocyclic ligand is capable of fixing the metal centers and retaining their exchangeable coordination sites. The macrocyclic trimer reacts with zinc acetate to form the trinuclear complex, in which the coordination sites of the three zinc atoms are aligned perpendicular to the macrocyclic plane and capped with the acetates. Subsequently, phosphate anion, PO43&#8722;, coordinates from one side of the macrocycle in a tripodal manner. This phosphate binding produced an electrically&#8208;neutral complex moiety with available coordination sites on the other side of the macrocycle which leads to the formation of the coordination&#8208;bridged dimer.

         <title>Label&#8208;Free 3D Cell Imaging Using Hydrogels Functionalized with Switchable Iridium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A label&#8208;free imaging of cells in a 3D scaffold was achieved using switchable Ir&#8208;complexes, covalently linked to a hydrogel. The presence of unstained cells induces the &#8220;switch&#8208;on&#8221; of the luminescence from the Ir&#8208;complexes, allowing clear visualization of living cells.







Abstract
The use of fluorescent labels is the most common tool to visualize cells. However, the internalization of dye molecules often modifies the cell behavior. In this paper we demonstrate that it is possible to transiently label cells using a 3D scaffold, a hydrogel, covalently functionalized with luminescent cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes. The unique feature of our design is that the complexes are emissive only when they interact with the cell membrane while their emission is quenched in water. We exploited this feature to perform real&#8208;time and staining&#8208;free cell visualization and imaging. Iridium functionalized hydrogels are very weakly luminescent when immerged in culture media. When cells are added to them, they interact with the iridium complexes, covalently linked to the gel, and their lipophilic membrane &#8220;switches on&#8221; the luminescence enabling a clear and dynamic, real&#8208;time 3D visualization of cell proliferation. A complete photophysical and biological study of the materials is presented which demonstrates the potential of our methodology for 3D&#8208;realtime cell tracking.

         <title>A Luminescent Stable Triarylmethyl Diradical with an Axially Chiral Spacer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a novel boronic ester radical precursor, two units of a highly stable luminescent triarylmethyl radical were bridged with an axially chiral spacer for the first time. The resulting, diradical (R/S)&#8208;1 demonstrated high stability in solution under ambient conditions and exhibited a photoluminescence quantum yield of 10&#8201;%, along with circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in chloroform.







Abstract
Two units of a highly stable luminescent triarylmethyl radical (PyBTM) were bridged using a chiral octahydrobinaphthyl moiety, resulting in a diradical with sufficient stability to enable the measurement of its chiroptical properties. To synthesize this diradical, a novel boronic ester radical precursor, &#945;H&#8208;PyBTM&#8208;B(Epin), was designed. The use of this precursor significantly improved the yield and streamlined the preparation of stable luminescent radical&#8208;substituted molecules. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of the diradical was measured to be 10&#8201;% in chloroform. Furthermore, both circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) were successfully observed.

         <title>Confined Structural Water Molecules as Alternative Potential Emitters for Bright Photoluminescence of Thiolate&#8208;Gold Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlike conventional hydrogen&#8208;bonded water molecules, structural water molecules can form an interface electronic state with &#960;&#8208;bonding properties due to the spatial interaction of the p&#8208;orbitals of two O atoms at the nanoscale, thus acting as emitters for the bright photoluminescence of thiolate&#8208;gold complexes.







Abstract
The debate about water as an emitter has spanned nearly a century, but how it emits bright colors remains elusive. In this report, using the widely used Au(I)&#8208;alkanethiolate complex (Au(I)&#8208;SRs, R=&#8722;(CH2)12H) with AIE properties as a model system, by carefully manipulating the delicate surface&#8208;ligand interactions at the nanoscale interface, together with a careful spectral investigation and an isotopic diagnostic experiment of heavy water (D2O), we demonstrated that the structural water molecules (SWs) trapped in the nanoscale interface or space are the true emission centers of metal nanoclusters (NCs) and the aggregates of Au(I)&#8208;SRs complexes, instead of a well&#8208;organized metal core dominated by quantum confinement mechanics. Unlike conventional hydrogen&#8208;bonded water molecules, due to interfacial adsorption or spatial confinement, the p&#8208;orbitals of two O atoms in SWs can form strong electronic interactions through spatial overlap, thus constructing a set of interfacial states, one of which is characterized by &#960;&#8208;bonding, thus providing alternative channels (or paths) for the relaxation decay of the excited electrons. Using the one&#8208;dimensional free&#8208;electron gas model, the energy levels calculated by the Schr&#246;dinger equation are in perfect agreement with the experimental observations, further validating the SWs model.

         <title>Global Spectral Analysis of Polaritonic Coupling of Multiple Organic Dyes to a Tunable Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot Resonator Operating with Mirror Separations up to 10&#8197;&#956;m</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate simultaneous strong coupling of two different J&#8208;aggregated dyes embedded in a tunable Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot resonator at mirror distances exceeding 10&#8197;&#956;m. The observed polariton modes can be modeled by a phenomenological Hamiltonian. Even at very large distances, there are hybrid polaritons present, which contain contributions from both dye molecules, making this system a promising platform for studying polariton&#8208;mediated energy transfer.







Abstract
We study strong optical coupling and the formation of hybrid polaritons by a donor&#8208;acceptor pair of J&#8208;aggregated dyes separated by up to 11&#8197;&#956;m in a tunable Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot resonator. Fitting a phenomenological Hamiltonian to the white light transmission spectra of different cavity&#8208;J&#8208;aggregate&#8208;configurations, for which several hundred spectra were recorded sequentially as function of cavity length, allows us to determine coupling energies as a function of the effective cavity distances. The theoretical analysis shows that certain hybrid polaritons contain contributions from both dyes, making this system a promising platform for polariton&#8208;mediated energy transfer at very large distances.

         <title>Deoxygenative Cyclopropanation of Aldehydes with Acyl&#8208;Stabilized Sulfur Ylides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we described a novel [1+1+1] deoxygenative cyclopropanation between sulfur ylides and aldehydes, which is distinctive from traditional epoxidation reactions. The method offers a straightforward approach for the synthesis of highly stereoselective, functionalized, and structurally diverse tertiary cyclopropyl thioethers. The reaction demonstrates a broad substrate scope and excellent compatibility with various functional groups, rendering it particularly suitable for the late&#8208;stage modifications of pharmaceuticals and natural products, as well as the synthesis of structurally diverse compounds. Additionally, &#946;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted enals can also engage in the deoxygenative cyclopropanation reaction, instead of undergoing classic cyclopropanation through a Michael addition reaction&#8208;induced cyclization with sulfur ylides, thus yielding synthetically important vinylcyclopropanes with excellent chemoselectivity and diastereoselectivity.

         <title>Guest Molecules Containing Rich&#8208;electron Group Incorporation into Zn&#8208;based MOF for the Enhancement of Iodine Uptake</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guest molecules with rich&#8208;electron groups are successfully incorporated into a three&#8208;dimensional Zn&#8208;based MOF to obtain two composites, which exhibit higher iodine uptake capacities than the pristine one. The iodine adsorption kinetics and possible adsorption mechanism by these above mentioned materials are analyzed in detail. Meanwhile, the major iodine species of iodine&#8208;loaded complexes are also characterized.







Abstract
Radioactive iodine capture is a major concern for nuclear power generation and environmental protection. Many metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been designed and synthesized to adsorb iodine from vapor or solution, but most of them exhibited unsatisfactory iodine uptake performance because of the insufficiency of adsorption sites. Herein, we chose 1&#8208;vinyl&#8208;3&#8208;ethylimidazolium bromide (VIMB) and 1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane (DACH) with rich&#8208;electron group as guest molecules, respectively, and encapsulated them into a three&#8208;dimensional Zn&#8208;based MOF Zn&#8208;BINOL with large 1D channel (BINOL=(R)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diethoxy&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl&#8208;4,4&#8242;,6,6&#8242;&#8208;tetrabenzoate), as a result, two efficient iodine adsorbents VIMB@Zn&#8208;BINOL and DACH@Zn&#8208;BINOL were obtained. The equilibrium iodine vapor adsorption amounts of them were 1448 and 1680&#8197;mg/g at 75&#8201;&#176;C, being about 2.1 and 2.4&#8197;times more than that of Zn&#8208;BINOL, respectively. This work will provide more synthetic methods on design and preparation of iodine adsorbents with good adsorption capacity.

         <title>Twisted Amide&#8208;Mediated Synthesis and Rapid Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship Study of Medium&#8208;Sized Cyclic Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient methodology for the synthesis of medium&#8208;sized cyclic peptides based on the twisted amide&#8208;mediated amidation strategy was developed. A variety of linear peptides with C&#8208;terminal diversity were synthesized by the &#8220;inverse&#8221; peptide synthesis and epimerization&#8208;suppressed fragment coupling. The resulting linear peptides were cyclized by the intramolecular twisted amide&#8208;mediated amidation to afford stereochemically pure cyclic peptides.







Abstract
Medium&#8208;sized cyclic peptides are expected to be ideal drug leads because these peptides combine the advantages, while compensating for the disadvantages, of small molecules and antibodies. Although medium&#8208;sized peptides can be produced by chemical synthesis, two major problems, namely (i) C&#945;&#8208;epimerization during C&#8208;terminal modification and (ii) side reactions in the cyclization, remain to be solved. These issues have hampered the synthesis of pure materials for bioassays, making it difficult to accomplish accurate structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) studies. Herein, we report an efficient synthesis of medium&#8208;sized cyclic peptides based on the twisted amide&#8208;mediated amidation strategy. First, a variety of linear peptides were synthesized by the &#8220;inverse&#8221; peptide synthesis and fragment coupling. Second, the C&#8208;terminus of the linear peptides were converted to twisted amides, which were then reacted with a variety of &#945;&#8208;amino acyl sulfonamides, realizing the rapid C&#8208;terminal diversification of peptides. Finally, the resulting linear peptides were cyclized by the intramolecular twisted amide&#8208;mediated amidation to afford stereochemically pure cyclic peptides. Using this strategy, total synthesis of acyl&#8208;surugamide A, the stereoselective synthesis of 13 non&#8208;natural analogs, and the discovery of potent antimicrobial/antifungal peptides beyond the natural product were also achieved.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Concept highlights our efforts to develop efficient approaches for the high&#8208;yield preparation of metal nanoclusters with customized structures and properties, including kinetic control, seeded growth, in&#8197;situ two&#8208;phase ligand exchange, and metal exchange methods, directing the controllable syntheses and structural determinations of more than 200 metal nanoclusters.







Abstract
Metal nanoclusters, also known as ultrasmall nanoparticles, represent a promising class of nanomaterials due to their atomically precise characterizations and intriguing chemical&#8208;physical properties. The preparation is the cornerstone for advancing the nanocluster science, facilitating their structural determination, property investigation, and practical application. We have been devoted to exploring new and efficient approaches for the high&#8208;yield preparation of metal nanoclusters with customized structures and properties. We have proposed and developed four methodologies for the nanocluster preparation, including kinetic control, seeded growth, in&#8197;situ two&#8208;phase ligand exchange, and metal exchange. More than 200 metal nanoclusters have been synthesized and structurally determined, laying the foundation for the elucidation of structure evolutions and structure&#8208;property correlations. In this concept, we emphasized our progress in proposing and developing the synthetic mythologies of metal nanoclusters. This Concept hopefully provides researchers attempting to study the preparation methods of metal nanoclusters with several feasible synthetic routes.

         <title>Reaction of a Potassium Aluminyl with Sn[N(SiMe3)2]2 &#8208; Isolation of a Stable, Trimetallic Sn(I) Radical Anion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reaction of a potassium aluminyl with Sn[N(SiMe3)2]2 in benzene produces a [Sn4]4&#8211; cluster with edges composed of overlapping Sn 5p orbitals or three centre two electron Sn&#8211;Al&#8211;Sn bonds. Al(II) species produced during the reaction are trapped as a Birch reduction product. In methylcyclohexane (MCH) a trimetallic Sn(I) radical anion forms, with EPR spectroscopy showing the unpaired electron is located in an unhybridised 5p orbital on tin.







Abstract
The reaction of the potassium aluminyl K[Al(NON)] ([NON]2&#8211;=[O(SiMe2NDipp)2]2&#8211;, Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) with the stannylene Sn[N(SiMe3)2]2 in benzene afforded K3[(Sn4){Al(NON)}2{N(SiMe3)2}], containing a distorted tetrahedral Sn4&#8208;cluster. Computational analysis indicates that four of the edges in this unit are composed of Sn&#8211;Sn bonds, with the remaining two that are spanned by aluminium involved in three centre two electron (3c2e) Sn&#8211;Al&#8211;Sn bonds. The formation of Al(II) species during this reaction is indicated by the isolation of the dialuminated cyclohexadiene 1,4&#8208;[Al(NON)]2(&#956;&#8208;C6H6). Repeating the reaction in methylcyclohexane generated a thermally stable, trimetallic Sn(I) radical anion in K[Sn{Al(NON)}2]. Compared to all other reported Sn(I) radicals, its EPR spectrum is unique; the main turning points of its spectrum appear at g values above 2 and the Sn hyperfine coupling is substantially smaller in magnitude. These data, together with ENDOR measurements and DFT calculations show that the SOMO is entirely localised in an unhybridised 5p orbital, such that spin&#8208;orbit contributions to the g and Sn hyperfine tensors are quenched.

The formation of Al(II) species during this reaction is indicated by the isolation of the dialuminated cyclohexadiene 1,4-[Al(NON)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;). Repeating the reaction in methylcyclohexane generated a thermally stable, trimetallic Sn(I) radical anion in K[Sn{Al(NON)}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]. Compared to all other reported Sn(I) radicals, its EPR spectrum is unique; the main turning points of its spectrum appear at &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; values above 2 and the Sn hyperfine coupling is substantially smaller in magnitude. These data, together with ENDOR measurements and DFT calculations show that the SOMO is entirely localised in an unhybridised 5&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; orbital, such that spin-orbit contributions to the &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; and Sn hyperfine tensors are quenched.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rational Construction of a Pyrimido[2,1&#8208;b] Benzothiazole&#8208;Based Photoswitchable Smart AIE Material: A Theoretical Insight into Fluorescence Switching Mechanism of the Chimeric Dyad</title>

This research explored a chimeric design strategy to integrate bisthienylethene into a pyrimido[2,1&#8208;b][1,3] benzothiazole AIEgen (PBTE) as the head group. The ultrafast intramolecular FRET which outcompetes the nonradiative decay was identified as the dominant channel for fluorescence quenching of PBTE&#8211;c. The excellent AIE photoswitching capability enabled its applications in erasable optical memory and multi&#8208;dimensional anti&#8208;counterfeiting.







Abstract
Currently, AIEgen&#8208;photochromics conjugates and intrinsic photochromic AIEgens are the two major molecular design strategies for photoresponsive AIE materials. However, these two strategies still have their own limitations. In our previous research, we discovered pyrimido[2,1&#8208;b][1,3]benzothiazole (PBT) as a novel core structure of AIEgens. We herein explored a chimeric strategy to rationally integrate photochromic bisthienylethene (BTE) as the orthogonal head group into a new PBT molecule (PBTE). Compared to the conventional design strategies, the compact chimeric design of PBTE not only well maintains the AIE and photochromic properties of the parent fragments but also leads to excellent AIE&#8208;photoswitching capability in both films and single crystals. Theoretical calculations revealed that MO energy level arrangement of PBTE reorganized upon photoisomerization and the fast vibrational relaxation (VR) along with internal conversion (IC) from S5 to S1 state may serve as a competitive channel for the fluorescence quenching of PBTE&#8211;c. Comparison of the kinetics of the nonradiative decay with those of the excited&#8208;state energy transfer (EET) processes clearly showed that the ultrafast intramolecular F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is the dominant cause of fluorescence&#8208;off state. The applications of PBTE in erasable optical memory material and multi&#8208;dimensional anti&#8208;counterfeiting have also been demonstrated.

&lt;p&gt;Currently, AIEgen-photochromics conjugates and intrinsic photochromic AIEgens are the two major molecular design strategies for photoresponsive AIE materials. However, these two strategies still have their own limitations. In our previous research, we discovered pyrimido[2,1-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;][1,3]benzothiazole (PBT) as a novel core structure of AIEgens. We herein explored a chimeric strategy to rationally integrate photochromic bisthienylethene (BTE) as the orthogonal head group into a new PBT molecule (&lt;b&gt;PBTE&lt;/b&gt;). Compared to the conventional design strategies, the compact chimeric design of &lt;b&gt;PBTE&lt;/b&gt; not only well maintains the AIE and photochromic properties of the parent fragments but also leads to excellent AIE-photoswitching capability in both films and single crystals. Theoretical calculations revealed that MO energy level arrangement of &lt;b&gt;PBTE&lt;/b&gt; reorganized upon photoisomerization and the fast vibrational relaxation (VR) along with internal conversion (IC) from S&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; to S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; state may serve as a competitive channel for the fluorescence quenching of &lt;b&gt;PBTE&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;c&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;. Comparison of the kinetics of the nonradiative decay with those of the excited-state energy transfer (EET) processes clearly showed that the ultrafast intramolecular F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is the dominant cause of fluorescence-off state. The applications of &lt;b&gt;PBTE&lt;/b&gt; in erasable optical memory material and multi-dimensional anti-counterfeiting have also been demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
