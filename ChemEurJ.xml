         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Terminal vs. Fluorine&#8208;Substituted N&#8208; Allenamides via Addition of Diazo Compounds to Terminal Ynamides.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A copper&#8208;mediated coupling reaction between ynamides and diazo&#8208;compounds to produce  N  &#8208;allenamides is reported for the first time. This method enables facile and rapid access to terminal  N  &#8208;allenamides by using commercially available TMS&#8208;diazomethane with wide functional group compatibility on the nitrogen. Furthermore, the ubiquity of molecules containing a fluorine moiety in medicine, in agricultural, and material science requires the continuous search of new building blocks, including this unique surrogate. The CuI/diazo protocol was successfully applied to the synthesis of fluorine&#8208;substituted  N  &#8208;allenamides. DFT calculations provided insights in the mechanism involved.</dc:description>

         <title>Carrier Protein&#8208;Free Enzymatic Biaryl Coupling in Arylomycin A2 Assembly and Structure of the Cytochrome P450 AryC**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The arylomycins are antibiotic natural products that inhibit bacterial signal peptidase. Within this work, the biaryl&#8208;bond forming cytochrome P450 of arylomycin biosynthesis, AryC, is structurally and functionally characterized. Convergent preparation of the linear lipopeptide precursor followed by enzymatic installation of the biaryl structural element by AryC results in a streamlined chemo&#8208;enzymatic access to arylomycin A2. Unlike oxidative cross&#8208;coupling enzymes in glycopeptide biosynthesis, AryC accepts carrier protein&#8208;free peptide substrates, a tremendous advantage for future biocatalytic applications in complex peptide synthesis.







Abstract
The arylomycin antibiotics are potent inhibitors of bacterial type I signal peptidase. These lipohexapeptides contain a biaryl structural motif reminiscent of glycopeptide antibiotics. We herein describe the functional and structural evaluation of AryC, the cytochrome P450 performing biaryl coupling in biosynthetic arylomycin assembly. Unlike its enzymatic counterparts in glycopeptide biosynthesis, AryC converts free substrates without the requirement of any protein interaction partner, likely enabled by a strongly hydrophobic cavity at the surface of AryC pointing to the substrate tunnel. This activity enables chemo&#8208;enzymatic assembly of arylomycin A2 that combines the advantages of liquid&#8208; and solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis with late&#8208;stage enzymatic cross&#8208;coupling. The reactivity of AryC is unprecedented in cytochrome P450&#8208;mediated biaryl construction in non&#8208;ribosomal peptides, in which peptidyl carrier protein (PCP)&#8208;tethering so far was shown crucial both in&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;vitro.

         <title>Coordination cage&#8208;based emulsifiers: templated formation of metal oxide microcapsules monitored by in situ LC&#8208;TEM</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metallo&#8208;supramolecular self&#8208;assembly has yielded a plethora of discrete&#160;nanosystems, many of which show competence in capturing guests and catalyzing chemical reactions. However, the potential of low&#8208;molecular bottom&#8208;up self&#8208;assemblies in the development of structured inorganic materials has rarely been methodically explored so far. Herein, we present a new type of metallo&#8208;supramolecular surfactant with the ability to stabilize non&#8208;aqueous emulsions for a significant period. The molecular design of the surfactant is based on a heteroleptic coordination cage (  CGA&#8208;3  ;  CGA  = Cage&#8208;based Gemini Amphiphile), assembled from two pairs of organic building blocks, grouped around two Pd(II) cations. Shape&#8208;complementarity between the differently functionalized components generates discrete amphiphiles with a tailor&#8208;made polarity profile, able to stabilize non&#8208;aqueous emulsions, such as hexadecane&#8208;in&#8208;DMSO. These emulsions were used as a medium for the synthesis of spherical metal oxide microcapsules (titanium oxide, zirconium oxide, and niobium oxide) from soluble, water&#8208;sensitive alkoxide precursors by allowing a controlled dosage of water to the liquid&#8208;liquid phase boundary. Synthesized materials were analyzed by a combination of electron microscopic techniques.  In situ  liquid cell transmission electron microscopy (LC&#8208;TEM) was utilized for the first time to visualize the dynamics of the emulsion&#8208;templated formation of hollow inorganic titanium oxide and zirconium oxide microspheres.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Metallo-supramolecular self-assembly has yielded a plethora of discrete&#160;nanosystems, many of which show competence in capturing guests and catalyzing chemical reactions. However, the potential of low-molecular bottom-up self-assemblies in the development of structured inorganic materials has rarely been methodically explored so far. Herein, we present a new type of metallo-supramolecular surfactant with the ability to stabilize non-aqueous emulsions for a significant period. The molecular design of the surfactant is based on a heteroleptic coordination cage (  CGA-3  ;  CGA  = Cage-based Gemini Amphiphile), assembled from two pairs of organic building blocks, grouped around two Pd(II) cations. Shape-complementarity between the differently functionalized components generates discrete amphiphiles with a tailor-made polarity profile, able to stabilize non-aqueous emulsions, such as hexadecane-in-DMSO. These emulsions were used as a medium for the synthesis of spherical metal oxide microcapsules (titanium oxide, zirconium oxide, and niobium oxide) from soluble, water-sensitive alkoxide precursors by allowing a controlled dosage of water to the liquid-liquid phase boundary. Synthesized materials were analyzed by a combination of electron microscopic techniques.  In situ  liquid cell transmission electron microscopy (LC-TEM) was utilized for the first time to visualize the dynamics of the emulsion-templated formation of hollow inorganic titanium oxide and zirconium oxide microspheres.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanism&#8208;Based Approach to Reagent Selection for Oxidative Carbon&#8211;Hydrogen Bond Cleavage Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Numerous hydride&#8208;abstracting agents generate the same cationic intermediate, but substrate features such as intermediate cation stability, oxidation potential, and steric environment can influence reaction rates in an oxidant&#8208;dependent manner. This manuscript provides experimental data to illustrate the role that structural features play in the kinetics of hydride abstraction reactions with commonly used quinone&#8208;, oxoammonium ion&#8208;, and carbocation&#8208; based oxidants. Computational studies of the transition state structures and energies explain these results and energy decomposition analysis calculations reveal unique sensitivities to electrostatic attraction and steric repulsions. Rigorous rate studies of select reactions validated the capacity of the calculations to predict reactivity trends. Additionally, kinetics studies demonstrate the potential for product inhibition in DDQ&#8208;mediated reactions. These studies provide a clear guide to select the optimal oxidant for structurally disparate substrates and lead to predictions of reactivity that were validated experimentally.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Acyclic Stereotriads Featuring Fluorinated Tetrasubstituted Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Elaboration of enantioenriched complex acyclic stereotriads represents a challenge for modern synthesis even more when fluorinated tetrasubstituted stereocenters are targeted. We have been able to develop a simple strategy in a sequence of two unprecedented steps combining a diastereoselective aldol&#8208;Tishchenko reaction and an enantioselective organocatalyzed kinetic resolution. The aldol&#8208;Tishchenko reaction generates directly a large panel of acyclic 1,3&#8208;diols possessing a fluorinated tetrasubstituted stereocenter by condensation of fluorinated ketones with aldehydes under very mild basic conditions. The anti 1,3&#8208;diols featuring three contiguous stereogenic centers are generated with excellent diastereocontrol (typically &gt; 99:1 dr ). Depending upon the precursors both diastereomers of stereotriads are accessible through this flexible reaction. Furthermore, from the obtained racemic scaffolds, development of an organocatalyzed kinetic resolution enabled to generate the desired enantioenriched stereotriads with excellent selectivity (typically er &gt; 95:5).</dc:description>

         <title>Helic[6]arene&#8208;Based Chiral Pseudo[1]rotaxanes and [1]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral pseudo[1]rotaxanes and [1]rotaxanes constructed from macrocyclic arenes still remain a big challenge mainly owing to the lack of such chiral macrocycles. In this work, a new system of chiral pseudo[1]rotaxanes formed by self&#8208;inclusion of helic[6]arene containing amide linked with the terminal tertiary amines was first discovered. Based on an atom&#8208;economic stopping strategy, a pair of chiral [1]rotaxanes were conveniently obtained in almost quantitative yields by blocking the pseudo[1]rotaxanes with monobenzyl bromide of tetraphenylethene. The structures of pseudo[1]rotaxanes and [1]rotaxanes were characterized by 2D NMR spectra in solution, combining with the DFT calculations. The photophysical properties further revealed the efficient chirality transfer of helic[6]arene to the tetraphenylethene moiety, compared to their unthreaded chiral isomers. The discovery of the chiral pseudo[1]rotaxanes allows for a wide and available synthesis of chiral [1]rotaxanes, and also opening a new avenue to the design of chiral supramolecular materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogen Bonding Adsorbent Pyridine N&#8208;oxides for Iodine Capture in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonporous crystal materials from one&#8208;step synthesized single component pyridine N&#8208;oxides (2&#8208;((naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethyl)thio)pyridine 1&#8208;oxide: NTPO) for iodine capture in water driven by halogen bond between oxygen atom of NTPO and iodine molecule, along with a single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal transformation process of crystal NTPO to binary cocrystals combined with NTPO and iodine. Besides, the nonporous material NTPO also have great potential in the adsorption of iodine in vapor state and organic solvents (cyclohexane and n&#8208;hexane).







Abstract
Rapid capture of 129I with high volatility and toxicity in the environment has attracted much attention. Herein we reported a firstly synthesized nonporous material: pyridine N&#8208;oxides (NTPO and ATPO) as iodine adsorbent. Both of NTPO and ATPO exhibit remarkable performance on the adsorption of iodine in aqueous solution, vapor state and organic solvents. Upon the capture of iodine, pyridine N&#8208;oxides were transformed to binary cocrystals combined with the pyridine N&#8208;oxides and iodine which is driven by halogen bond between iodine and oxygen atoms. Moreover, pyridine N&#8208;oxides shows high chemical, thermal and moisture stability.

         <title>Molecular Scissors for Tailor&#8208;Made Modification of Siloxane Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic methodology for a tailored design of functional siloxanes is presented. We show that by incorporating molecular scissors into the siloxane framework, the Si&#8722;O&#8722;Si linkage can easily be cleaved at a desired position and siloxy groups exchanged for one another. The method allows also for a direct one&#8208;step cleavage of chlorosiloxanes and shows broad substrate scope, high variability of functional siloxy units, and excellent selectivity.







Abstract
The controlled design of functional oligosiloxanes is an important topic in current research. A consecutive Si&#8722;O&#8722;Si bond cleavage/formation using siloxanes that are substituted with 1,2&#8208;diaminobenzene derivatives acting as molecular scissors is presented. The method allows to cut at certain positions of a siloxane scaffold forming a cyclic diaminosilane or &#8208;siloxane intermediate and then to introduce new functional siloxy units. The procedure could be extended to a direct one&#8208;step cleavage of chlorooligosiloxanes. Both siloxane formation and cleavage proceed with good to excellent yields, high regioselectivity, and great variability of the siloxy units. Control of the selectivity is achieved by the choice of the amino substituent. Insight into the mechanism was provided by low temperature NMR studies and the isolation of a lithiated intermediate.

         <dc:description>
Simple indole&#8208;based merocyanines have been successfully designed as unfused nonfullerene acceptors for organic solar cells by forming dimers with A&#8722;D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D&#8722;A structure that have a facile synthesis, enhanced photostability compared to well&#8208;known ITIC acceptor, and high electron mobility in blend films. When blended with P3HT donor, one of dimers, i.&#8201;e. Z2, shows a good cell efficiency of 3.53&#8201;%.







Abstract
Merocyanine (MC) dyes exhibit facile synthesis and attractive optical properties, making them widely studied as the donor materials in organic solar cells (OSCs). In this study, for the first time, simple indole&#8208;based MCs are successfully designed as unfused nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) for OSCs by forming dimers with A&#8722;D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D&#8722;A structure, which possess enhanced photostability compared to the well&#8208;known ITIC acceptor and high electron mobility in blend films. When blended with P3HT donor, one of the dimers, i.&#8201;e. Z2, shows a good cell efficiency of 3.53&#8201;%, which outperforms the performance of most of P3HT/NFA blends, particularly for unfused systems, and thus indicates good potential of simple MCs as NFAs.

Tailor&#8208;made 3D conducting polymer networks containing tetraphenylbenzidine redox units are presented as novel platform for the introduction of tunable amounts of additional functional redox species via polymer analogous click chemistry in films.

Abstract
In this manuscript we present a versatile platform for introducing functional redox species into tailor&#8208;made 3D redox polymer networks. Electrochemical characterization based on cyclic voltammetry is applied to verify the immobilization of the redox species within the conducting networks. Ultimately this strategy shall be extended to (photo)electrocatalytic applications which will profit from the conducting polymer matrix. Soluble precursor copolymers are synthesized via radical copolymerization of vinyltriphenylamine (VTPA) with chloromethylstyrene (CMS) in different ratios, whereas CMS is subsequently converted into azidomethylstyrene (AMS) to yield poly(VTPA&#8208;co&#8208;AMS) copolymers. Spin&#8208;coating of poly(VTPA&#8208;co&#8208;AMS) on gold electrodes yields thin films which are converted into stable polymer network structures by electrochemical crosslinking of the polymer chains via their pendant triphenylamine groups to yield N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;tetraphenylbenzidine (TPB) crosslinking points. Finally, the resulting redox&#8208;active, TPB&#8208;crosslinked films are functionalized with ethynylferrocene (EFc) as a representative redox probe using a click reaction. Main experimental tools are polarization modulation infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy and scan rate dependent cyclic voltammetry. Especially the latter proves the successful conversion and the immobilization of redox probes in the polymer matrix. The results are compared with the reference system of azide&#8208;terminated self&#8208;assembled monolayers on gold substrates, allowing to distinguish between free and immobilized EFc species.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this manuscript we present a versatile platform for introducing functional redox species into tailor-made 3D redox polymer networks. Electrochemical characterization based on cyclic voltammetry is applied to verify the immobilization of the redox species within the conducting networks. Ultimately this strategy shall be extended to (photo)electrocatalytic applications which will profit from the conducting polymer matrix. Soluble precursor copolymers are synthesized via radical copolymerization of vinyltriphenylamine (VTPA) with chloromethylstyrene (CMS) in different ratios, whereas CMS is subsequently converted into azidomethylstyrene (AMS) to yield poly(VTPA-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-AMS) copolymers. Spin-coating of poly(VTPA-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-AMS) on gold electrodes yields thin films which are converted into stable polymer network structures by electrochemical crosslinking of the polymer chains via their pendant triphenylamine groups to yield N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;-tetraphenylbenzidine (TPB) crosslinking points. Finally, the resulting redox-active, TPB-crosslinked films are functionalized with ethynylferrocene (EFc) as a representative redox probe using a click reaction. Main experimental tools are polarization modulation infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy and scan rate dependent cyclic voltammetry. Especially the latter proves the successful conversion and the immobilization of redox probes in the polymer matrix. The results are compared with the reference system of azide-terminated self-assembled monolayers on gold substrates, allowing to distinguish between free and immobilized EFc species.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Understanding the Preparation and Reactivity of Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 Methane Dehydroaromatization Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methane dehydroaromatization is a promising reaction for the direct conversion of methane to liquid hydrocarbons. The active sites and the mechanism of this reaction remain controversial. This work is focused on the operando X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy analysis of conventional Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 catalyst during its whole lifetime. Complemented by other characterization techniques, we derived spectroscopic descriptors of molybdenum precursor decomposition and its exchange with zeolite Br&#248;nsted acid sites. We found that the reduction of Mo&#8208;species proceeds in two steps and the active sites are of siminar nature, regardless of the Mo content. Furthermore, the ZSM&#8208;5 unit cell contracts at the beginning of the reaction, which coincided with benzene formation and it is likely related to the formation of hydrocarbon pool intermediates. Finally, although reductive regeneration of used catalysts via methanation is less effective as compared to combustion of coke, it does not affect the structure of the catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysts for the Hydrofluorination of Alkynes Using Hydrofluoric Acid: Reaction Scope, Mechanistic Studies and the Tracking of Elusive Intermediates</title>

         <dc:description>
Unconventional fluorination: The development of the chemoselective gold&#8208;catalysed hydrofluorination of terminal alkynes using aqueous HF and an easily accessible N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;gold pre&#8208;catalyst is reported. Following the observation and isolation of unprecedented organometallic intermediates and computational studies, a catalytic cycle is proposed, featuring an in&#8197;situ generation of the chemoselective catalyst.







Abstract
An efficient and chemoselective methodology deploying gold&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes as catalysts in the hydrofluorination of terminal alkynes using aqueous HF has been developed. Mechanistic studies shed light on an in&#8197;situ generated catalyst, formed by the reaction of Br&#248;nsted basic gold pre&#8208;catalysts with HF in water, which exhibits the highest reactivity and chemoselectivity. The catalytic system has a wide alkyl substituted&#8208;substrate scope, and stoichiometric as well as catalytic reactions with tailor&#8208;designed gold pre&#8208;catalysts enable the identification of various gold species involved along the catalytic cycle. Computational studies aid in understanding the chemoselectivity observed through examination of key mechanistic steps for phosphine&#8208; and NHC&#8208;coordinated gold species bearing the triflate counterion and the elusive key complex bearing a bifluoride counterion.

         <title>Weinreb Amide, Ketone and Amine as Potential and Competitive Secondary Molecular Stations for Dibenzo&#8208;[24]Crown&#8208;8&#8201;in [2]Rotaxane Molecular Shuttles</title>

         <dc:description>
New DB24C8&#8208;based [2]rotaxane molecular shuttles that contain ammonium, amine, Weinreb amide and/or ketone stations have been synthesized and characterized. Their shuttling behavior, which is linked to the ability of the considered moieties to act as efficient secondary molecular stations of more or less high affinity for the macrocycle, depended on the combination of stations and steric restrictions.







Abstract
This paper reports the synthesis and study of new pH&#8208;sensitive DB24C8&#8208;based [2]rotaxane molecular shuttles that contain within their axle four potential sites of interaction for the DB24C8: ammonium, amine, Weinreb amide, and ketone. In the protonated state, the DB24C8 lay around the best ammonium site. After either deprotonation or deprotonation&#8208;then&#8208;carbamoylation of the ammonium, different localizations of the DB24C8 were seen, depending on both the number and nature of the secondary stations and steric restriction. Unexpectedly, the results indicated that the Weinreb amide was not a proper secondary molecular station for the DB24C8. Nevertheless, through its methoxy side chain, it slowed down the shuttling of the macrocycle along the threaded axle, thereby partitioning the [2]rotaxane into two translational isomers on the NMR timescale. The ketone was successfully used as a secondary molecular station, and its weak affinity for the DB24C8 was similar to that of a secondary amine.

         <title>A Phosphorus&#8208;Based Pacman Dication Generated by Cooperative Self&#8208;Activation of a Pacman Phosphane</title>

         <dc:description>
You can play Pac Man with Phosphorus! The first non&#8208;metal Pacman compound, a calix[4]pyrrole schiff base ligand coordinating two highly dynamic P(III)Cl moieties is presented. Chloride abstraction with AgOTf leads to a macrocyclic dication with two embedded phosphorus monocations, both of which undergo a cooperative internal activation reaction.







Abstract
Formal coordination of phosphorus(III) by a calix[4]pyrrole Schiff base ligand was achieved through the reaction of this ligand with PCl3 under basic conditions. The reaction product adopts a Pacman conformation with two P&#8722;Cl moieties, one in exo and one in endo position. It represents the first non&#8208;metal compound of calix[4]pyrrole Schiff base ligands and of Pacman ligands in general. The spatial neighborhood of the two phosphorus atoms enables cooperative reactions. As a first example, the chloride abstraction with AgOTf is presented, yielding a macrocyclic dication with two embedded phosphorus(III) monocations, which both undergo a cooperative, internal activation reaction with an adjacent C=N double bond. This intramolecular redox process affords two pentacoordinated phosphorus(V) centers within the Pacman dication. All reaction products were fully characterized and all results are supported by computations.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Multi&#8208;Photon Tracking and Bioimaging of Glycosylated Theranostic Prodrugs upon Specific Enzyme Triggered Release</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycosylated theranostic prodrugs have been developed, whereby the therapeutic component undergoes triggered release upon enzyme activation of the glycosidic bond through action of the specific glycosidase enzymes, resulting in selective delivery of the therapeutic cargo, a process observed through real&#8208;time bioimaging.







Abstract
Real&#8208;time tracking of prodrug uptake, delivery and activation in&#8197;vivo represents a major challenge for prodrug development. Herein, we demonstrate the use of novel glycosylated theranostics of the cancer pharmacophore Amonafide in highly&#8208;selective, enzymatic triggered release. We show that the use of endogenous enzymes for activated release of the therapeutic component can be observed, in real time, and monitored using one and two&#8208;photon bioimaging, offering unique insight into the prodrug pharmacokinetic profile. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the potent cytotoxicity of Amonafide is preserved using this targeted approach.

         <title>Flexibility Control of Two&#8208;Dimensional Coordination Polymers by Crystal Morphology: Water Adsorption and Thermal Expansion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Preparing nanoplates of flexible two&#8208;dimensional coordination polymers provides significant structural changes involving the contraction of undulating layers. Such crystal morphology and size effects on layer structures modulate the dual functions of water adsorption and anisotropic thermal expansion.







Abstract
Layer flexibility in two&#8208;dimensional coordination polymers (2D&#8208;CPs) contributes to several functional materials as it results in anisotropic structural response to external stimuli. Chemical modification is a common technique for modifying layer structures. This study demonstrates that crystal morphology of a cyanide&#8208;bridged 2D&#8208;CP of type [Mn(salen)]2[ReN(CN)4] (1) consisting of flexible undulating layers significantly impacts the layer configuration and assembly. Nanoplates of 1 showed an in&#8208;plane contraction of layers with a longer interlayer distance compared to the micrometer&#8208;sized rod&#8208;type particles. These effects by crystal morphology on the structure of the 2D&#8208;CP impacted the structural flexibility, resulting in dual&#8208;functional changes: the enhancement of the sensitivity of structural transformation to water adsorption and modification of anisotropic thermal expansion of 1. Moreover, the nanoplates incorporated new adsorption sites within the layers, resulting in the uptake of an additional water molecule compared to the micrometer&#8208;sized rods.

         <title>Chemistry on the Complex: Derivatization of TiO4N2&#8208;Based Complexes and Application to Multi&#8208;Step Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemistry performed on TiO4N2&#8211;complexes enables the derivatization of 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline ligands via metal catalyzed reactions, click chemistry or imine condensation. These complexes are purified by chromatography and their structures are determined. The free substituted 1,10&#8208; phenanthroline compounds are easily obtained through the decoordination from the titanium center. The application of this chemistry on the complex permits to generate an original bis&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline compound.







Abstract
The chemistry on octahedral TiO4N2&#8208;complexes is described. The Ti(IV)&#8208;based precursors are composed of two 3,3&#8217;&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;biphenolato ligands (1) and one substituted 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline ligand (2&#8208;5). The application of imine condensation, palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C bond formation or copper&#8208;catalysed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition allowed the grafting of various new groups onto these species. In particular Sonogashira reactions permitted to observe an excellent conversion of the starting complexes. This systematic study enabled to compile the factors required to preserve the framework of the complexes in the course of a chemical transformation. Thanks to this chemistry realized on the complex, the Ti(1)2 fragment was used as a protecting group to develop a multi&#8208;step synthesis of a bis&#8208;phenanthroline compound (12), for which the synthesis without this protection failed. Thus, a dinuclear complex [Ti2(1)4(12)] was first prepared starting from complex precursor bearing an acetylenic function via a Hay coupling reaction. This was followed by a deprotection step affording 12. Overall, this work illustrates how the Ti(1)2 fragment could be an useful tool for the preparation of unprecedented diimine compounds.

         <title>Screening of Minimalist Noncanonical Sites in Duplex DNA and RNA Reveals Context and Motif&#8208;Selective Binding by Fluorogenic Base Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A semi&#8208;rational approach to detect low affinity binding to noncanonical pair (NCP) sites in duplex DNA and RNA has been developed. A set of fluorogenic thiazole orange probes bearing abiotic (triazines, pyrimidines) and native RNA bases was screened against dsDNAs and dsRNAs with single abasic, single NCP and tandem NCP sites. Fluorogenic probe engagement revealed novel and selective base interactions with NCPs, setting the stage for a new strategy of targeting noncanonical motifs in RNA.







Abstract
We hypothesize that programmable hybridization to noncanonical nucleic acid motifs may be achieved by macromolecular display of binders to individual noncanonical pairs (NCPs). As each recognition element may individually have weak binding to an NCP, we developed a semi&#8208;rational approach to detect low affinity interactions between selected nitrogenous bases and noncanonical sites in duplex DNA and RNA. A set of fluorogenic probes was synthesized by coupling abiotic (triazines, pyrimidines) and native RNA bases to thiazole orange (TO) dye. This probe library was screened against duplex nucleic acid substrates bearing single abasic, single NCP, and tandem NCP sites. Probe engagement with NCP sites was reported by 100&#8211;1000&#215; fluorescence enhancement over background. Binding is strongly context&#8208;dependent, reflective of both molecular recognition and stability: less stable motifs are more likely to bind a synthetic probe. Further, DNA and RNA substrates exhibit entirely different abasic and single NCP binding profiles. While probe binding in the abasic and single NCP screens was monotonous, much richer binding profiles were observed with the screen of tandem NCP sites in RNA, in part due to increased steric accessibility. In addition to known binding interactions between the triazine melamine (M) and T/U sites, the NCP screens identified new targeting elements for pyrimidine&#8208;rich motifs in single NCPs and 2&#215;2 internal bulges. We anticipate that semi&#8208;rational approaches of this type will lead to programmable noncanonical hybridization strategies at the macromolecular level.

         <title>On the Supra&#8208;LUMO Interaction: Case Study of a Sudden Change of Electronic Structure as a Functional Emergence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon sudden change of electronic structure (SCES), the doubly&#8208;electrophoric trans conformer of this redox&#8208;active assembly switches into a singly&#8208;superelectrophoric cis conformer on account of the synergistic interplay of electrophilic centers pertaining to the two pyridinium moieties. An extended LUMO (coined as supLUMO) indeed develops through space, which also plays the role of electron reservoir.







Abstract
The synergistic functioning of redox&#8208;active components that emerges from prototypical 2,2&#8242;&#8208;di(N&#8208;methylpyrid&#8208;4&#8208;ylium)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl is described. Interestingly, even if a trans conformation of the native assembly is expected, due to electrostatic repulsion between cationic pyridinium units, we demonstrate that cis conformation is equally energy&#8208;stabilized on account of a peculiar LUMO (SupLUMO) that develops through space, encompassing the two pyridiniums in a single, made&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8208;piece, electronic entity (superelectrophoric behavior). This SupLUMO emergence, with the cis species as superelectrophore embodiment, originates in a sudden change of electronic structure. This finding is substantiated by insights from solid state (single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction) and solution (NOE NMR and UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR spectroelectrochemistry) studies, combined with electronic structure computations. Electrochemistry shows that electron transfers are so strongly correlated that two&#8208;electron reduction manifests itself as a single&#8208;step process with a large potential inversion consistent with inner creation of a carbon&#8208;carbon bond (digital simulation). Besides, absence of reductive formation of dimers is a further indication of a preferential intramolecular reactivity determined by the SupLUMO interaction (cis isomer pre&#8208;organization). The redox&#8208;gated covalent bond, serving as electron reservoir, was studied via atropisomerism of the reduction product (VT&#8197;NMR study). The overall picture derived from this in&#8208;depth study of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;di(N&#8208;methylpyrid&#8208;4&#8208;ylium)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl proves that trans and cis species are worth considered as intrinsically sharply different, that is, as doubly&#8208;electrophoric and singly&#8208;superelectrophoric switchable assemblies, beyond conformational isomerism. Most importantly, the through&#8208;space&#8208;mediated SupLUMO may come in complement of other weak interactions encountered in Supramolecular Chemistry as a tool for the design of electroactive architectures.

         <title>Rational Design of Self&#8208;Assembled Mitochondria&#8208;Targeting Lytic Peptide Conjugates with Enhanced Tumor Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To improve the tumor selectivity of membrane lytic peptides, a self&#8208;assembly strategy based on rational design of peptide conjugates has been developed. A hydrophobic triphenylphosphonium (TPP) group for mitochondria targeting and a hydrophilic arginine&#8208;glycine&#8208;aspartic acid (RGD) sequence targeting the integrin receptor have been incorporated to pH&#8208;responsive lytic peptides. The self&#8208;assembled nanoparticles are endocytosed selectively into the cancer cells, followed by the disruption of lysosomal and mitochondrial membranes, and lead to apoptotic cell death in the micromolar range.







Abstract
Membrane lytic peptides (MLP) are widely explored as cellular delivery vehicles or antitumor/antibacterial agents. However, the poor selectivity between cancer and normal cells slims their prospects as potential anti&#8208;tumor drugs. Herein, we have developed a rationally designed self&#8208;assembly strategy to enhance tumor selectivity of MLP&#8208;based conjugates, incorporating a hydrophobic triphenylphosphonium (TPP) group for mitochondria targeting, and a hydrophilic arginine&#8208;glycine&#8208;aspartic acid (RGD) sequence targeting integrins. The self&#8208;assembly nanoparticles can enhance the stability of the peptides in&#8197;vitro plasma and be endocytosed selectively into the cancer cells. The histidine&#8208;rich lytic peptide component assists the disruption of endosomal/lysosomal membranes and subsequent the mitochondria membrane, which leads to apoptosis. This rational design of MLP&#8208;based conjugates provides a practical strategy to increase the application prospects of lytic peptides in cancer treatment.

         <title>19F MRI Probes for Multimodal Imaging**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic resonance is one of the most effective imaging instruments available today, capable of showing superior soft tissue contrast. Multimodal 19F MRI probes have the potential to enhance detection sensitivity and accuracy, which is crucial in disease diagnosis. This review discusses research in the integration of 19F MRI probes with other modalities, with an emphasis on the structure, physicochemical properties, biocompatibility, and image quality.







Abstract
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most powerful imaging tools today, capable of displaying superior soft&#8208;tissue contrast. This review discusses developments in the field of 19F MRI multimodal probes in combination with optical fluorescence imaging (OFI), 1H MRI, chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI, ultrasonography (USG), X&#8208;ray computed tomography (CT), single photon emission tomography (SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET), and photoacoustic imaging (PAI). In each case, multimodal 19F MRI probes compensate for the deficiency of individual techniques and offer improved sensitivity or accuracy of detection over unimodal counterparts. Strategies for designing 19F MRI multimodal probes are described with respect to their structure, physicochemical properties, biocompatibility, and the quality of images.

         <title>Coupling of photoactive transition metal complexes to a functional polymer matrix**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integration of molecular light&#8208;driven catalyst into a polymer matrix allows to tailor photochemical devices as the embedding can give control over charge transfer processes, photochemical reactivity and degradation resistance. Combining periodic and local quantum chemical approaches, we elucidate the electronic coupling between a polymer and a photosensitive complex, which is a prerequisite for a rational tailoring of such systems. Thus, we identify possible routes towards photoinduced excitations that could trigger catalytic reactions at metal centers attached to the photosensitizer.







Abstract
Conductive polymers represent a promising alternative to semiconducting oxide electrodes typically used in dye&#8208;sensitized cathodes as they more easily allow a tuning of the physicochemical properties. This can then also be very beneficial for using them in light&#8208;driven catalysis. In this computational study, we address the coupling of Ru&#8208;based photosensitizers to a polymer matrix by combining two different first&#8208;principles electronic structure approaches. We use a periodic density functional theory code to properly account for the delocalized nature of the electronic states in the polymer. These ground state investigations are complemented by time&#8208;dependent density functional theory simulations to assess the Franck&#8208;Condon photophysics of the present photoactive hybrid material based on a molecular model system. Our results are consistent with recent experimental observations and allow to elucidate the light&#8208;driven redox chemical processes &#8211; eventually leading to charge separation &#8211; in the present functional hybrid systems with potential application as photocathode materials.

         <title>An NHC&#8208;Stabilized H2GeBH2 Precursor for the Preparation of Cationic Group 13/14/15 Hydride Chains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The NHC&#8208;stabilized compound IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH2BH2OTf was synthesized. Reactivity studies on this novel building block with different phosphines and AsPh3 showed its potential to serve as an ideal precursor for unprecedented cationic group 13/14/15 chain compounds. In addition, a reaction with PH3 leads to the formation of the parent hydrides [IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH2BH2PH3][OTf] and [IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH3][OTf].







Abstract
The synthesis, characterization and reactivity studies of the NHC&#8208;stabilized complex IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH2BH2OTf (1) (IDipp=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) are reported. Nucleophilic substitution of the triflate (OTf) group in 1 by phosphine or arsine donors provides access to the cationic group 13/14/15 chains [IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH2BH2ERR1R2]+ (2 E=P; R, R1=H; R2=tBu; 3 E=P; R=H; R1, R2=Ph; 4&#8201;a E=P; R, R1, R2=Ph; 4&#8201;b E=As; R, R1, R2=Ph). These novel cationic chains were characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Moreover, the formation of the parent complexes [IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH2BH2PH3][OTf] (5) and [IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH3][OTf] (6) were achieved by reaction of 1 with PH3. Accompanying DFT computations give insight into the stability of the formed chains with respect to their decomposition.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Direct Oxidation of Primary Amines to Carboxylic Acids through Tandem ortho&#8208;Naphthoquinone&#8208;Catalyzed and TBHP&#8208;Promoted Oxidation Sequence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

A tandem oxidation sequence of amines to carboxylic acids is developed through the o&#8208;NQ&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidation of amines to imines followed by the radical&#8208;initiated TBHP&#8208;promoted oxidation of imine intermediates. Mechanistically, the selective imine formation by o&#8208;NQ catalyst system is facilitated by the assistance of TBAI, also critical in the following TBHP&#8208;promoted oxidation of imine derivatives to break down the imines to aldehydes and amines. In turn, the released amines re&#8208;enter into the o&#8208;NQ catalytic cycle to produce the imine intermediates.







Abstract
Biomimetic oxidation of primary amines to carboxylic acids has been developed where the copper&#8208;containing amine oxidase (CuAO)&#8208;like o&#8208;NQ&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidation was combined with the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)&#8208;like TBHP&#8208;mediated imine oxidation protocol. Notably, the current tandem oxidation strategy provides a new mechanistic insight into the imine intermediate and the seemingly simple TBHP&#8208;mediated oxidation pathways of imines. The developed metal&#8208;free amine oxidation protocol allows the use of molecular oxygen and TBHP, safe forms of oxidant that may appeal to the industrial application.

Ribbon&#8208;like and block&#8208;like crystals of (E)&#8208;3&#8208;(3,5&#8208;dichlorophenyl)&#8208;1&#8208;(p&#8208;tolyl)prop&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;one (2ClChMe&#8208;4) exhibit curling/flipping and expansion, respectively, upon heating on account of single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformations in polymorphs. Besides, 2ClChMe&#8208;4 can undergo a solid&#8208;state [2+2] cycloaddition reaction, which becomes the driving force for the photo&#8208;induced bending of the ribbon&#8208;like crystal, so that the molecular&#8208;crystal&#8208;based photoactuator could perform mechanical work for carrying small object. Herein, a multi&#8208;stimuli responsive actuator showing reversible bending&#8208;unbending behavior triggered by light and heat successively has been fabricated.







Abstract
The polymorphs of 2ClChMe&#8208;4 in Form I (ribbon&#8208;like crystal) and Form II (block&#8208;like crystal) were prepared, and they exhibited curling/flipping and expansion upon heating on account of single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformations. The irreversible phase transformations occurred separately at 53.2&#8201;&#176;C and 57.8&#8201;&#176;C for the crystals in Form I and Form II, during which the molecular conformation of 2ClChMe&#8208;4 changed and the molecules slipped along the (100) plane. Movement at the molecular level resulted in changes of cell parameters, which in turn led to macroscopic motions of the crystals upon heating. Additionally, the ribbon&#8208;like crystals of 2ClChMe&#8208;4 showed photo&#8208;induced bending driven by [2+2] cycloaddition. Accordingly, an actuator showing reversible bending behavior was fabricated triggered by light and heat successively. Like biomimetic self&#8208;actuators, such multi&#8208;stimuli mechanical responsive molecular crystals might have potential applications in soft robots, artificial muscles and microfluidic systems.

         <title>Comprehensive Structural Analysis of the Bitter Components in Beer by the HPLC&#8208;Assisted Crystalline Sponge Method</title>

         <dc:description>
Beer taste of your favorite is blendable! Comprehensive identification of derivatives from trans&#8208;iso&#8208;&#945;&#8208;acid, derived from one of the most abundant secondary metabolites in hops, was achieved by the HPLC&#8208;assisted crystalline sponge method. Thirteen components, including previously unknown eight, were fully characterized, promising the development of new, advanced brewing technology for controlling the bitter components of beer.







Abstract
Trans&#8208;iso&#8208;&#945;&#8208;acid is one of the main contributors to the bitter taste of fresh beer and is known to transform into various derivatives during beer aging. However, structural characterization of the derivatives has been a challenging task because of the formation of too many components. Herein, we report that most of the transformation products of trans&#8208;iso&#8208;&#945;&#8208;acid, isolated in this study in only small quantities by HPLC, can be structurally analyzed with the crystalline sponge method. Thirteen compounds, including eight that were previously unreported, have been successfully isolated and analyzed with complete assignment of their absolute configuration. This provides an improved understanding of the chemical transformations that occur during beer aging.

         <title>Comprehensive Mechanism of CO2 Electroreduction on Non&#8208;Noble Metal Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts of Mo2CS2&#8208;MXene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of non&#8208;noble metal single&#8208;atom catalyst of Mo2CS2&#8208;MXene for CO2 reduction were systematically investigated (see figure). The Cr&#8208;, Fe&#8208;, Co&#8208; and Ni&#8208;Mo2CS2 have excellent CO2RR catalytic activity, and their limiting potentials are in the range of 0.245&#8211;0.304&#8197;V. Fe&#8208;Mo2CS2 with a nitrogenase&#8208;like structure has the lowest limiting potential and the highest electrocatalytic activity.







Abstract
In this work, a series of non&#8208;noble metal single&#8208;atom catalysts of Mo2CS2&#8208;MXene for CO2 reduction were systematically investigated by well&#8208;defined density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory (DFT) calculations. It is found that nine types of transitional metal (TM) supported Mo2CS2 (TM&#8208;Mo2CS2) are very stable, while eight can effectively inhibit the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). After comprehensively comparing the changes of free energy for each pathway in CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), it is found that the products of TM&#8208;Mo2CS2 are not completely CH4. Furthermore, Cr&#8208;, Fe&#8208;, Co&#8208; and Ni&#8208;Mo2CS2 are found to render excellent CO2RR catalytic activity, and their limiting potentials are in the range of 0.245&#8211;0.304&#8197;V. In particular, Fe&#8208;Mo2CS2 with a nitrogenase&#8208;like structure has the lowest limiting potential and the highest electrocatalytic activity. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations have also proven that these kinds of single&#8208;atom catalysts with robust performance could exist stably at room temperature. Therefore, these single TM atoms anchored on the surface of MXenes can be profiled as a promising catalyst for the electrochemical reduction of CO2.

         <title>Pivotal Role of Holes in Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction on TiO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bare TiO2 cannot conduct a photocatalytic oxidation reaction and photocatalytic CO2 reduction simultaneously, as demonstrated by Moustakas et&#8197;al. This points to a key role of holes in the CO2 reduction mechanism towards the final product CH4.







Abstract
Evidence is provided that in a gas&#8208;solid photocatalytic reaction the removal of photogenerated holes from a titania (TiO2) photocatalyst is always detrimental for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The coupling of the reaction to a sacrificial oxidation reaction hinders or entirely prohibits the formation of CH4 as a reduction product. This agrees with earlier work in which the detrimental effect of oxygen&#8208;evolving cocatalysts was demonstrated. Photocatalytic alcohol oxidation or even overall water splitting proceeds in these reaction systems, but carbon&#8208;containing products from CO2 reduction are no longer observed. H2 addition is also detrimental, either because it scavenges holes or because it is not an efficient proton donor on TiO2. The results are discussed in light of previously suggested reaction mechanisms for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The formation of CH4 from CO2 is likely not a linear sequence of reduction steps but includes oxidative elementary steps. Furthermore, new hypotheses on the origin of the required protons are suggested.

         <title>Partial Hydrolysis of Cyanide Coordination Polymers Induced by a Pillar Ligand with Optimized Electrochemical Kinetics for Rechargeable Alkaline Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Delaying the inevitable: Hydrolysis of MOF and coordination polymer electrode materials in alkaline electrolyte is inevitable. However, we have found that the hydrolysis of cyanide&#8208;bridged nickel&#8208;based coordination polymer electrode materials can be suppressed by the introduction of pillared pyrazine ligands; this optimizes the electrochemical performance. The possible mechanism of partial hydrolysis of electrode materials was proposed, and the hypothesis was justified by ex situ electrochemical and structural characterization.







Abstract
Coordination polymers are promising cathode materials for rechargeable alkaline batteries. Therefore, the precise modulation of these cathodes by chemical structure and in&#8208;depth structure transform study is necessary. Here, two model coordination polymer battery cathodes were designed to demonstrate the dynamic structure&#8211;performance relationship. We studied the electrochemical performance of two kinds of nickel&#8208;based coordination polymer, comprising a planar 2D cyanide&#8208;bridged network and a 3D cyanide&#8208;bridged network pillared by pyrazine molecules. The 2D coordination polymer showed serious voltage degradation with poor rate capability, whereas the 3D coordination polymer exhibited stable voltage output coupled with high rate at various current densities. The investigation revealed the underlining relationship of plateau voltage degradation and hydrolysis process of electrodes. It was revealed that the pyrazine pillar molecules in the 3D coordination polymer could suppress the hydrolysis and lead to the in&#8197;situ formation of partially hydrolyzed structure with excellent electrochemical kinetics; this exhibited obvious smaller peak separation (27&#8197;mV compared with 149&#8197;mV) and hence an almost twofold increase in capacity retention (31.9 to 50.0&#8201;%) and energy density retention (18.2 to 35.9&#8201;%) at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>PEGylated Poly&#8208;HDACi: a Designer Polyprodrug from Optimized Drug Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We designed, synthesized, and characterized a tri&#8208;block copolymer. Its hydrophobic part, a chain of histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) prodrug, was symmetrically flanked by two identical PEG blocks, whereas the built&#8208;in HDACi was a linear molecule, terminated with a thiol at one end, and a hydroxyl group at the other. Such a feature facilitated end to end linkage of prodrugs through alternatively aligned disulfides and carbonates. The disulfides served dual roles: redox sensors of smart nanomedicine, and warheads of masked HDACi drugs. This approach carefully designed to benefit both control&#8208;release and efficacy, is conceptually novel for optimizing drug units in nanomedicine. Micelles from this designer polyprodrug released only PEG, CO 2 and HDACi, and synergized with DOX against HCT116 cells, demonstrating its widespread potential in combination therapy. Our work for the first time highlighted the unique advantage of thiol&#8208;based drug molecules in nanomedicine design.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing Highly Efficient Blue OLEDs with External Quantum Efficiencies up to 7.5&#8201;% Based on Anthracene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 65, Page 16181-16188, November 22, 2021. </description>

Better Constructions: By inserting anthracene core in the deep&#8208;blue building block, two D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A fluorescent blue emitters, ICz&#8208;An&#8208;PPI and IP&#8208;An&#8208;PPI were designed and synthesized. Impressively, the doped deep&#8208;blue OLED based on IP&#8208;An&#8208;PPI exhibited excellent performances with an unexpectedly high EQE of 7.5&#8201;% with the CIE coordinate of (0.150, 0.118), which is one of the best among the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art deep&#8208;blue OLEDs with the CIEy &lt;0.12.







Abstract
Acquiring desirable device performance with deep&#8208;blue color purity that fulfills practical application requirements is still a challenge. Bipolar fluorescent emitters with hybrid local and charge transfer (HLCT) state may serve to address this issue. Herein, by inserting anthracene core in the deep&#8208;blue building blocks, the authors successfully developed two highly twisted D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A fluorescent emitters, ICz&#8208;An&#8208;PPI and IP&#8208;An&#8208;PPI, featuring different acceptor groups. Both exhibited superb thermal stabilities, high photo luminescent quantum yields and excellent bipolar transport capabilities. The non&#8208;doped OLEDs using ICz&#8208;An&#8208;PPI and IP&#8208;An&#8208;PPI as the emitting layers showed efficient blue emission with an external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 4.32&#8201;% and 5.41&#8201;%, and the CIE coordinates of (0.147, 0.180) and (0.149, 0.150), respectively. In addition, the deep blue doped device based on ICz&#8208;An&#8208;PPI was achieved with an excellent CEmax of 5.83 cd A&#8722;1, EQEmax of 4.6&#8201;% and the CIE coordinate of (0.148, 0.078), which is extremely close to the National Television Standards Committee (NTSC) standard. Particularly, IP&#8208;An&#8208;PPI&#8208;based doped device had better performance, with an EQEmax of 7.51&#8201;% and the CIE coordinate of (0.150, 0.118), which was very impressive among the recently reported deep&#8208;blue OLEDs with the CIEy &lt;0.12. Such high performance may be attributed to the hot exciton HLCT mechanism via T7 to S2. Our work may provide a new approach for designing high&#8208;efficiency deep&#8208;blue materials.

Photo&#8208;induced C&#8722;H benzylation under ruthernium catalysis enabled exceedingly mild syntheses of diarylmethane compounds. The robustness of this approach was demonstrated by an ample scope, including photo C&#8722;H allylations and reactions on water.







Abstract
The ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of diarylmethane compounds was realized under exceedingly mild photoredox conditions without the use of exogenous photocatalysts. The versatility and robustness of the ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H benzylation was reflected by an ample scope, including multifold C&#8722;H functionalizations, as well as transformable pyrazoles, imidates and sensitive nucleosides. Mechanistic studies were indicative of a photoactive cyclometalated ruthenium complex, which also enabled versatile C&#8722;H allylations.

         <dc:description>
The single crystal structures, UV&#8208;vis absorption spectra in neutral and acidic solutions, fluorescence emission properties, MCD spectra, and their singlet oxygen photosensitization properties of all octaethyl&#8208;&#946;,&#946;&#8217;&#8208;dioxo&#8208;porphyrin isomers are presented. DFT Computations reveal the underlying tautomeric equilibria and the strong electronic interactions of the &#946;&#8208;oxo&#8208;functionalities with the porphyrinic &#960;&#8208;system. This contribution adds to the understanding of porphyrinoids carrying the &#946;&#8208;oxo&#8208;auxochrome and lays the foundation for their further utilization.







Abstract
It is well&#8208;known that treatment of &#946;&#8208;octaethylporphyrin with H2O2/conc. H2SO4 converts it to a &#946;&#8208;oxochlorin as well as all five constitutional isomers of the corresponding &#946;,&#946;&#8217;&#8208;dioxo&#8208;derivatives: two bacteriochlorin&#8208;type isomers (&#946;&#8208;oxo groups at opposite pyrrolic building blocks) and three isobacteriochlorin&#8208;type isomers (&#946;&#8208;oxo&#8208;groups at adjacent pyrrolic building blocks). By virtue of the presence of the strongly electronically coupled &#946;&#8208;oxo auxochromes, none of the chromophores are archetypical chlorins, bacteriochlorins, or isobacteriochlorins. Here the authors present, inter alia, the single crystal X&#8208;ray structures of all free&#8208;base diketone isomers and a comparative description of their UV&#8208;vis absorption spectra in neutral and acidic solutions, and fluorescence emission and singlet oxygen photosensitization properties, Magnetic Circular Dichroism (MCD) spectra, and singlet excited state lifetimes. DFT computations uncover underlying tautomeric equilibria and electronic interactions controlling their electronic properties, adding to the understanding of porphyrinoids carrying &#946;&#8208;oxo functionalities. This comparative study lays the basis for their further study and utilization.

A Fe(II)NHC sensitizer bearing a dimethoxyphenyl group on the ancillary ligand scored the highest efficiency ever reported for an iron&#8208;sensitized solar cell (1.83&#8201;%) using Mg2+ and NBu4I&#8208;based electrolyte and a thick 20&#8197;&#956;m TiO2 anode.







Abstract
A series of six new Fe(II)NHC&#8208;carboxylic sensitizers with their ancillary ligand decorated with functions of varied electronic properties have been designed with the aim to increase the metal&#8208;to&#8208; surface charge separation and light harvesting in iron&#8208;based dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). ARM130 scored the highest efficiency ever reported for an iron&#8208;sensitized solar cell (1.83&#8201;%) using Mg2+ and NBu4I&#8208;based electrolyte and a thick 20&#8197;&#956;m TiO2 anode. Computational modelling, transient absorption spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) revealed that the electronic properties induced by the dimethoxyphenyl&#8208;substituted NHC ligand of ARM130 led to the best combination of electron injection yield and spectral sensitivity breadth.

A Pd&#8208;catalyzed CO&#8208;free carbonylative synthesis of 4H&#8208;benzo[d][1,3]oxazin&#8208;4&#8208;one derivatives was developed. This new method employed readily available N&#8208;(o&#8208;bromoaryl)amides as the starting materials and inexpensive benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triyl triformate (TFBen) as the stable solid CO surrogate, which would not cause hydrodehalogenation of the starting materials. Remarkably, this method featured a very broad substrate scope and was especially useful for incorporation benzo[d][1,3]oxazin&#8208;4&#8208;one structure into drugs and naturally biologically active compounds.

This procedure does not require the toxic and flammable gas CO as the carbonyl source and tolerates a wide scope of functional groups. Remarkably, 4H&#8208;benzo[d][1,3]oxazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones incorporated to natural products and drugs can be constructed by this method.

         <title>Helical Oligophenylene Linked with [2.2]Paracyclophane: Stereogenic &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Dye for Highly Emissive Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 65, Page 16225-16231, November 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helical oligophenylene: Chiral cyclic homologues with unique structures such as double helices and twisted triangles, have been synthesized as highly emissive chiroptical dyes. The twisted quaterphenyl units exhibited CPL with a high quantum yield (0.73&#8211;0.80), leading to relatively high CPL brightness.







Abstract
A stereogenic &#960;&#8208;system based on dimer (2) and trimer (3) of [2.2]paracyclophane (PC) and biphenyl was prepared and its structural, photophysical, and chiroptical properties were investigated. X&#8208;ray analysis revealed that the quaterphenyl moieties in 2 adopt a double helical structure anchoring [2.2]PC from both sides. Furthermore, 3 forms a isosceles triangle structure with a large chiral cavity. A homodesmotic reaction using DFT calculations revealed that 2 has a larger strain energy than 3 owing to its highly twisted phenylene linkers.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Helical oligophenylene&lt;/b&gt;: Chiral cyclic homologues with unique structures such as double helices and twisted triangles, have been synthesized as highly emissive chiroptical dyes. The twisted quaterphenyl units exhibited CPL with a high quantum yield (0.73&#8211;0.80), leading to relatively high CPL brightness.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A stereogenic &#960;-system based on dimer (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) and trimer (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;) of [2.2]paracyclophane (PC) and biphenyl was prepared and its structural, photophysical, and chiroptical properties were investigated. X-ray analysis revealed that the quaterphenyl moieties in &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; adopt a double helical structure anchoring [2.2]PC from both sides. Furthermore, &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; forms a isosceles triangle structure with a large chiral cavity. A homodesmotic reaction using DFT calculations revealed that &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; has a larger strain energy than &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; owing to its highly twisted phenylene linkers. Electronic and circular dichroic (CD) spectra were recorded in CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; solution. The spectra of both &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; are similar, and their longest absorption band accompanying a remarkable Cotton effect is attributed to the transition from HOMO to LUMO, which is delocalized to the quaterphenyl moiety.

         <title>Exciton Coupling in Redox&#8208;Active Salen based Self&#8208;Assembled Metallacycles</title>

Self&#8208;assembly of redox&#8208;active Ni salen donors and Ru dimer acceptors affords a [2+2] rectangle for the shorter acceptor and a catenane for the longer acceptor. Catenane formation is dependent on solvent choice and concentration. Oxidation to form salen ligand radicals results in exciton coupling of the intense near&#8208;infrared intervalence charge transfer band confirming that the macrocycles remain intact upon oxidation.







Abstract
The incorporation of a redox&#8208;active nickel salen complex into supramolecular structures was explored via coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly with homobimetallic ruthenium complexes (bridged by oxalato or 5,8&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;naphthoquinato ligands). The self&#8208;assembly resulted in the formation of a discrete rectangle using the oxalato complex and either a rectangle or a catenane employing the larger naphthoquinonato complex. The formation of the interlocked self&#8208;assembly was determined to be solvent and concentration dependent. The electronic structure and stability of the oxidized metallacycles was probed using electrochemical experiments, UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR absorption, EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculations, confirming ligand radical formation. Exciton coupling of the intense near&#8208;infrared (NIR) ligand radical intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) bands provided further confirmation of the geometric and electronic structures in solution.

         <title>Tubular Structures of Calcium Carbonate: Formation, Characterization, and Implications in Natural Mineral Environments</title>

Prebiotic barriers? Calcium carbonate chemical gardens are self&#8208;assembled mineral membranes that form upon contact of a solid calcium salt with an alkaline carbonate&#8208;rich solution. In&#8208;situ studies on solution speciation and ex&#8208;situ membrane characterization show that the tube walls are highly crystalline materials with complex texture that impede ion exchange and prevent transmembrane electrochemical potentials from being generated. These findings have important implications for the relevance of such structures as microreactors for chemical conversions and as catalysts in prebiotic chemistry.







Abstract
Chemical gardens are self&#8208;assembled tubular precipitates formed by a combination of osmosis, buoyancy, and chemical reaction, and thought to be capable of catalyzing prebiotic condensation reactions. In many cases, the tube wall is a bilayer structure with the properties of a diaphragm and/or a membrane. The interest in silica gardens as microreactors for materials science has increased over the past decade because of their ability to create long&#8208;lasting electrochemical potential. In this study, we have grown single macroscopic tubes based on calcium carbonate and monitored their time&#8208;dependent behavior by in&#8197;situ measurements of pH, ionic concentrations inside and outside the tubular membranes, and electrochemical potential differences. Furthermore, we have characterized the composition and structure of the tubular membranes by using ex situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, infrared and Raman spectroscopy, as well as scanning electron microscopy. Based on the collected data, we propose a physicochemical mechanism for the formation and ripening of these peculiar CaCO3 structures and compare the results to those of other chemical garden systems. We find that the wall of the macroscopic calcium carbonate tubes is a bilayer of texturally distinct but compositionally similar calcite showing high crystallinity. The resulting high density of the material prevents macroscopic calcium carbonate gardens from developing significant electrochemical potential differences. In the light of these observations, possible implications in materials science and prebiotic (geo)chemistry are discussed.

Abstract
Site specific installation of a paramagnetic ion with magnetic anisotropy in a biomolecule generates valuable structural restraints, such as pseudocontact shifts (PCSs) and residual dipolar couplings (RDCs). These paramagnetic effects can be used to characterize the structures, interactions and dynamics of biological macromolecules and their complexes. Two single&#8208;armed DOTA&#8208;like tags, BrPSPy&#8208;DO3M(S)A&#8208;Ln and BrPSPy&#8208;6M&#8208;DO3M(S)A&#8208;Ln, each containing a thiol&#8208;specific reacting group, that is, a phenylsulfonyl pyridine moiety, are demonstrated as rigid, reactive and stable paramagnetic tags for protein modification by formation of a reducing resistant thioether bond between the protein and the tag. The two tags present high reactivity with the solvent exposed thiol group in aqueous solution at room temperature. The introduction of Br at the meta&#8208;position in pyridine enhances the reactivity of 4&#8208;phenylsulfonyl pyridine towards the solvent exposed thiol group in a protein, whereas the ortho&#8208;methyl group in pyridine increases the rigidity of the tag in the protein conjugates. The high performance of these two tags has been demonstrated in different cysteine mutants of ubiquitin and GB1. The high reactivity and rigidity of these two tags can be added in the toolbox of paramagnetic tags suitable for the high&#8208;resolution NMR measurements of biological macromolecules and their complexes.

         <title>Morphology Engineering of Fullerene (C60) Microstructures Featuring Surface Cracks with Enhanced Photoluminescence and Microscopic Recognition Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 65, Page 16212-16218, November 22, 2021. </description>

All they&#8242;re cracked up to be: C60 microstructures featuring surface cracks were synthesized for the first time from a phenetole/propan&#8208;1&#8208;ol (NPA) solvents system, in which phenetole and NPA molecules participate in the formation of the fcc ends and hcp sidewalls of the C60 microstructures, respectively. The introduction of surface cracks into C60 crystals benefits the photoluminescence enhancement and the development of microscopic recognition of C60 crystals, demonstrating their potential applications from optoelectronics to biology.







Abstract
Surface cracks could improve the optical and photoelectronic properties of crystalline materials as they increase specific surface area, but the controlled self&#8208;assembly of fullerene (C60) molecules into micro&#8208;/nanostructures with surface cracks is still challenging. Herein, we report the morphology engineering of novel C60 microstructures bearing surface cracks for the first time, selecting phenetole and propan&#8208;1&#8208;ol (NPA) as good and poor solvents, respectively. Our systematic investigations reveal that phenetole molecules initially participate in the formation of the ends of the C60 microstructures, and then NPA molecules are involved in the gradual growth of the sidewalls of the microstructures. Therefore, the surface cracks of C60 microstructures can be finely regulated by adjusting the addition of NPA and the crystallization time. Interestingly, the cracked C60 microstructures show superior photoluminescence properties relative to the smooth microstructures due to the increased specific surface area. In addition, C60 microstructures with wide cracks show preferential recognition of silica particles over C60 particles owing to electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged C60 microstructures and the positively charged silica microparticles. These C60 crystals with surface cracks have potential applications from optoelectronics to biology.

The introduction of surface cracks into C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; crystals benefits the photoluminescence enhancement and the development of microscopic recognition of C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; crystals, demonstrating their potential applications from optoelectronics to biology.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surface cracks could improve the optical and photoelectronic properties of crystalline materials as they increase specific surface area, but the controlled self-assembly of fullerene (C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;) molecules into micro-/nanostructures with surface cracks is still challenging. Herein, we report the morphology engineering of novel C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; microstructures bearing surface cracks for the first time, selecting phenetole and propan-1-ol (NPA) as good and poor solvents, respectively. Our systematic investigations reveal that phenetole molecules initially participate in the formation of the ends of the C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; microstructures, and then NPA molecules are involved in the gradual growth of the sidewalls of the microstructures. Therefore, the surface cracks of C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; microstructures can be finely regulated by adjusting the addition of NPA and the crystallization time. Interestingly, the cracked C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; microstructures show superior photoluminescence properties relative to the smooth microstructures due to the increased specific surface area. In addition, C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; microstructures with wide cracks show preferential recognition of silica particles over C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; particles owing to electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; microstructures and the positively charged silica microparticles. These C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; crystals with surface cracks have potential applications from optoelectronics to biology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Molecular Winch Prototypes</title>

Molecular machine: A family of loaded molecular winches were designed and synthesized as prototypes for mechanical studies at the single&#8208;molecule scale. The molecular winch structure derives from a molecular motor based on a ruthenium complex and is covalently linked to a series of molecular loads such as triptycene, fullerene and porphyrin fragments.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of conceptually new prototypes of molecular winches with the ultimate aim to investigate the work performed by a single ruthenium&#8208;based molecular motor anchored on a surface by probing its ability to pull a load upon electrically&#8208;driven directional rotation. According to a technomimetic design, the motor was embedded in a winch structure, with a long flexible polyethylene glycol chain terminated by an azide hook to connect a variety of molecular loads. The structure of the motor was first derivatized by means of two sequential cross&#8208;coupling reactions involving a penta(4&#8208;halogenophenyl)cyclopentadienyl hydrotris(indazolyl)borate ruthenium(II) precursor and the resulting benzylamine derivative was next exploited as key intermediate in the divergent synthesis of a family of nanowinch prototypes. A one&#8208;pot method involving sequential peptide coupling and Cu&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition was developed to yield four loaded nanowinches, with load fragments encompassing triptycene, fullerene and porphyrin moieties.

         <title>Redox Isomerization/(3+2) Allenoate Annulation by Auto&#8208;Tandem Phosphine Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 65, Page 16232-16236, November 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tandem catalysis allows a single catalyst to engage in two mechanistically distinct catalytic processes. While such approaches using transition metal catalysts are developed, they are less so in the field of organocatalysis. The use of a single phosphine catalyst is reported that mediates the redox isomerization of amino crotonates to give imines which then undergo (3+2) annulation with a range of allenoates in a second phosphine catalyzed process. Computational studies indicate that pivotal to the success of this reaction is the use of catalysts with similar ability to add to both allenoate and crotonate.







Abstract
A phosphine&#8208;catalyzed approach to pyrrolines has been developed that involves two mechanistically unlinked catalytic processes. The first involves the redox isomerization of amino crotonates to provide access to aliphatic tosyl imines, which then engage in a (3+2) annulation with various allenoates. The reaction shows generality, with 24 examples established, along with a low yielding and moderately enantioselective variant. Mechanistic studies indicate that the viability of the process is linked to the selection of catalysts with similar propensity to add to the two coupling partners.

         <title>Giant Shape&#8208;Persistent Tetrahedral Porphyrin System: Light&#8208;Induced Charge Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 65, Page 16250-16259, November 22, 2021. </description>

Giant multichromophore: A tetrahedral shape&#8208;persistent supramolecular structure has been fully characterised in the solid state (by X&#8208;ray diffraction) and in solution (by NMR, electrochemical and photophysical analysis). Excitation of either the scaffold (blue in the image) or the peripheral ruthenium porphyrins results in an ultrafast photoinduced electron transfer from the ruthenium porphyrins to the scaffold.







Abstract
Tetraphenylmethane appended with four pyridylpyridinium units works as a scaffold to self&#8208;assemble four ruthenium porphyrins in a tetrahedral shape&#8208;persistent giant architecture. The resulting supramolecular structure has been characterised in the solid state by X&#8208;ray single crystal analysis and in solution by various techniques. Multinuclear NMR spectroscopy confirms the 1&#8201;:&#8201;4 stoichiometry with the formation of a highly symmetric structure. The self&#8208;assembly process can be monitored by changes of the redox potentials, as well as by modifications in the visible absorption spectrum of the ruthenium porphyrin and by a complete quenching of both the bright fluorescence of the tetracationic scaffold and the weak phosphorescence of the ruthenium porphyrin. An ultrafast photoinduced electron transfer is responsible for this quenching process. The lifetime of the resulting charge separated state (800&#8197;ps) is about four times longer in the giant supramolecular structure compared to the model 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex formed by the ruthenium porphyrin and a single pyridylpyridinium unit. Electron delocalization over the tetrameric pyridinium structure is likely to be responsible for this effect.

         <title>Achieving Enhanced Photochromic Properties of Diarylethene through Host&#8208;Guest Interaction in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 65, Page 16153-16160, November 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the presence of CB[n] host, the photophysical and photochemical properties of diarylethene derivatives (DTEs) were significantly affected. With suitable CB[n], DTEs showed faster response rate, better fatigue resistance, and higher fluorescence quenching ratio, suggesting that high&#8208;performance photochromic system in aqueous solution can be constructed through CB[n]&#8208;based host&#8208;guest interactions.







Abstract
Diarylethene (DTE) has been widely used in fluorescence probes, molecular logic gates, optical data&#8208;storage devices owing to the excellent photochromic property, while constructing high&#8208;performance photochromic DTE in aqueous media remains a big challenge. Herein we present several host&#8208;guest systems formed between cucurbit[n]uril (CB[n], n=7, 8, 10) and two water&#8208;soluble DTE derivatives 1 and 2. It was found that host&#8208;guest interactions not only affect the photophysical properties of photochromic guests, but also make great differences on the photoreaction process. Different host&#8208;guest binding behaviors also lead to different effects on the photochromic properties of guests. In the presence of CB[n], both 1 and 2 showed enhanced emission and higher fluorescence quenching ratio at photostationary state. Besides, CB[10]&#8901;1 exhibited faster response rate in cyclization reaction and better photofatigue resistance than free 1 in aqueous solution, while the supramolecular assembly of (CB[8])n&#8901;(2)n showed slower response rate in both directions of the reversible photoreaction. Besides, the photofatigue resistance of 2 can be greatly improved through binding with CB[7]. Our results suggest that host&#8208;guest interactions could be an efficient way to improve photochromic properties of DTE in aqueous solution.

         <title>Stepwise Increase of NdIII&#8208;Based Phosphorescence by AIE&#8208;Active Sensitizer: Broadening the AIPE Family from Transition Metals to Discrete Near&#8208;Infrared Lanthanide Complexes**

With help of antenna effect, the excitation energies of the AIE&#8208;active sensitizers are enhanced while transferring into the inert NdIII excited state through 3LMCT. Further beneficial from the structural rigidification, AIE&#8208;active L as sensitizers possessed matched energy to NdIII, less non&#8208;radiative process, and low excitation window by twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT), thus affording the first AIPE&#8208;active discrete NIR&#8208;emitting lanthanide complexes with the longest lifetimes among NdIII&#8208;based complexes containing C&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
We designed two near&#8208;infrared (NIR) lanthanide complexes [(L)2&#8208;Nd(NO3)3] (L=TPE2&#8208;BPY for 1, TPE&#8208;BPY for 2) by employing aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active tetraphenylethylene (TPE) derivatives as sensitizers, which possessed matched energy to NdIII, prevented competitive deactivation under aggregation, even shifted the excitation window toward 600&#8197;nm by twisted intramolecular charge transfer. Furthermore, benefiting from the 4&#8201;f electron shielding effect and antenna effect, the enhanced excitation energies of the AIE&#8208;active sensitizers by structural rigidification transferred into the inert NdIII excited state through 3LMCT, affording the first aggregation&#8208;induced phosphorescence enhancement (AIPE)&#8208;active discrete NIR&#8208;emitting lanthanide complexes. As 1 equipped with more AIE&#8208;active TPE than 2, L&#8594;Nd energy transfer efficiency in the former was higher than that in the latter under the same conditions. Consequently, the crystal of 1 exhibited one of the longest lifetimes (9.69&#8197;&#956;s) among NdIII&#8208;based complexes containing C&#8722;H bonds.

         <title>Carbazole&#8208;Containing Carbadecaphyrins: Non&#8208;aromatic Expanded Porphyrins that Undergo Proton&#8208;Triggered Conformational Changes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 65, Page 16173-16180, November 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of meso&#8208;free expanded carbaporphyrins containing carbazole as key structural elements have been prepared. By judicious choice of acid, access to three distinct structural forms in the solid state. No evidence of global aromaticity was observed in any of the forms. Notably, both macrocycles in their protonated forms exhibit substantial absorbance in the NIR region resulting in a panchromatic absorption that extends up to 1200&#8197;nm.







Abstract
A pair of meso&#8208;unsubstituted expanded carbaporphyrins containing two carbazole moieties were prepared in high isolated yields (82 and 76&#8201;%, respectively). The two macrocycles, namely 3 and 4, differ with respect to their substitution at the carbazole N&#8208;atoms i.&#8201;e. by H and i&#8208;Bu, respectively. As prepared in their free&#8208;base forms, macrocycles 3 and 4 adopt figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight conformations and are best characterized as 40 &#960;&#8208;electron, non&#8208;aromatic species possessing a decaphyrin(1.1.0.0.0.1.1.0.0.0) skeleton. Protonation of 3 with either trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) or perchloric acid (HClO4) produces a parallelogram&#8208;shaped structure. A similar structure is produced when N&#8208;functionalized system 4 is treated with TFA. In contrast, protonation of 4 with HClO4 leads it to adopt a twisted M&#246;bius strip&#8208;like structure in the solid state, thus allowing access to three distinct conformational states as a function of the conditions.

The strength of the antiaromaticity of the title compounds is represented by the power of a phoenix. The phoenix, deprived of its vitality by the arrow of nitrogen, leaps into the flames of thiophene and is reborn strong again. This is a metaphor for the fact that the antiaromaticity of the 8&#960;&#8208;electron system pentalene is substantially impaired by nitrogen doping, but is restored by the condensation of thiophene rings.

Calcium carbonate chemical gardens are tubular mineral structures precipitated upon the addition of sodium carbonate solution to calcium chloride pellets. The tubes are composed of texturally distinct bilayers of aggregates of rhombohedral and cone&#8208;shaped calcite on their exterior and interior surfaces, respectively. These highly crystalline and dense bilayers prohibit the development of significant electrochemical potential differences across the tube walls. More information can be found in the Full Paper by M. Kellermeier, J.&#8197;M. Garc&#237;a&#8208;Ruiz et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101417).

Phenolic compounds are important functionalities in synthetic, natural, and industrial chemistry. Recently, the photochemical activity of their corresponding electron&#8208;rich anions (phenolates) has been exploited to perform novel carbon&#8208;carbon bond&#8208;forming reactions. This Minireview article describes the main features of excited state phenolates, highlighting their ability to drive radical organic transformations. We foresee that this Minireview might stimulate forthcoming investigations in such research field. For more information see the Minireview by Filippini, Prato et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;16062.

Presodiation, known as pre&#8208;doping of sodium ions, represents the addition of sodium sources to ensure adequate sodium content in the sodium&#8208;based energy storage systems. In this minireview, various presodiation strategies are divided into following categories: Electrochemical, Additives, Direct contact, Alternatives of Na and Novel methods. In addition, multiple functions of presodiation are clarified, such as compensating for sodium loss, addressing safety issue, enhancing energy density and so on, aiming to promote the development of Na&#8208;based energy storage systems. For more information, see the Minireview by X. Lou, G. Zou, and X. Ji et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;ff16082.

         <title>Cover Feature: Position Matters: Fluorescent Positional Isomers for Reliable Multichannel Encryption Devices (Chem. Eur. J. 65/2021)</title>

         <dc:description>
A multichannel device for information encryption that uses two fluorescent positional isomers of quinoxaline derivatives is reported. The asymmetry in their electron distribution results in distinguishable acid&#8208;/pH&#8208;responsive emissions that can be separately collected in different fluorescent channels. Thus, the reliability of the encryption can be improved by a minimal compositional difference and responsive mechanism on the molecular level. More information can be found in the Communication by N. Merbouh, F.&#8197;F. Loeffler, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103441).

Winning combo: Porphyrins and polyoxometalates can be combined into useful architectures for energy conversion, this minireview highlights the most successful strategies developed to date.







Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs) can act as unique reservoirs for multiple electron transfers. As POMs display only weak absorption in the visible spectrum, they can be associated with chromophores such as porphyrins and porphyrin antennae. In this Minireview, the research dedicated to the combination of porphyrins and polyoxometalates is put in context and the state of the art identifying the challenges addressed in the optimization of hybrid materials for applications is detailed.

In recent years lots of progress has been made in the field of presodiation, herein we provide a schematic overview of presodiation in Na&#8208;based energy storage systems, illustrating various strategies to compensate for irreversible sodium loss as well as other functions.







Abstract
Nowadays sodium&#8208;based energy storage systems (Na&#8208;based ESSs) have been widely researched as it possesses the possibility to replace traditional energy storage media to become next generation energy storage system. However, due to the irreversible loss of sodium ions in the first cycle, development of Na&#8208;based ESSs is limited. Presodiation, as a strategy of adding excess sodium ions to the system in advance, accomplishes the enhancement of electrochemical performance. In this minireview, different presodiation strategies applied in sodium&#8208;based energy storage systems will be summarized in detail, their functions and corresponding mechanisms will be discussed as well. Furthermore, the current novel application of presodiation method in other aspects of Na&#8208;based ESSs will be mentioned additionally. At last, in the view of present research status of presodiation, issues that can be mitigated are put forward and guidelines are given on how to deliberate in&#8208;depth presodiation technology in the future, dedicating to promote the further development of Na&#8208;based ESSs.

         <title>Switchable Chemoselectivity of Reactive Intermediates Formation and Their Direct Use in A Flow Microreactor</title>

Switching of chemoselectivity for organolithium reactions between halogen&#8208;lithium exchange reaction with carbolithiation was achieved in a flow microreactor.







Abstract
A chemoselectivity switchable microflow reaction was developed to generate reactive and unstable intermediates. The switchable chemoselectivity of this reaction enables a selection for one of two different intermediates, an aryllithium or a benzyl lithium, at will from the same starting material. Starting from bromo&#8208;substituted styrenes, the aryllithium intermediates were converted to the substituted styrenes, whereas the benzyl lithium intermediates were engaged in an anionic polymerization. These chemoselectivity&#8208;switchable reactions can be integrated to produce polymers that cannot be formed during typical polymerization reactions.

         <title>Synthesis of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons Decorated by Fluorinated Carbon Acids/Carbanions</title>

         <dc:description>
The reaction of biphenyl&#8208;alkynes with in&#8197;situ generated Tf2C=CH2 followed by neutralization gave polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) decorated by a highly stabilized carbanionic functionality. Thus obtained PAHs showed improved solubility in both aqueous and organic solvents.







Abstract
The carboarylation reaction of biphenyl&#8208;alkynes was successfully triggered by electrophilic attack of 1,1&#8208;bis(triflyl)ethylene on the alkyne moiety to give polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) decorated by superacidic carbon acid functionality. Neutralisation of thus obtained acids with NaHCO3 yielded the corresponding sodium salts, which showed improved solubility in both aqueous and organic solvents.

         <title>Position Matters: Fluorescent Positional Isomers for Reliable Multichannel Encryption Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 65, Page 16098-16102, November 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetry in the electron distribution of positional isomers of quinoxaline derivatives results in distinguishable acid&#8208;/pH&#8208;responsive emissions; this can function as the basis for enabling the construction of multichannel encryption devices. The reliability of encryption is improved by the minimized compositional difference and responsive mechanism on the molecular level.







Abstract
Fluorescence signals have been widely used in information encryption for a few decades, but still suffer from limited reliability. Here, reversible multichannel fluorescent devices with encrypted information were constructed, based on two fluorescent positional isomers of a diphenylquinoxaline derivative. Possessing the same core fluorescent group and acid&#8208;/pH&#8208;responsive mechanism, the two isomers showed different fluorescence colors in an acidic environment; this allowed us to realize stepwise encryption of information in orthogonal fluorescence channels. Because the protonation was reversible, the revealed information could be re&#8208;encrypted simply by heating. This approach highlights the value of positional isomers to build multichannel encryption devices, improving their reliability on the molecular level.

A series of highly substituted cyclobutenones undergoes 1,4&#8208;addition with zinc&#8208;based nucleophiles with and, for non&#8208;hindered acceptors, without the aid of a copper catalyst. The intermediate metal enolate can be trapped as an enol phosphate and further reacted with Grignard reagents in Kumada cross&#8208;coupling reactions. By this, a range of silylated cyclobutanone and cyclobutene derivatives becomes accessible.







Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed conjugate silylation of various cyclobutenone derivatives with Me2PhSiZnCl&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2LiCl or (Me2PhSi)2Zn&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xLiCl (x&#8804;4) to generate &#946;&#8208;silylated cyclobutanones is reported. Trapping the intermediate enolate with ClP(O)(OPh)2 affords silylated enol phosphates that can be further engaged in Kumada cross&#8208;coupling reactions to yield silylated cyclobutene derivatives.

         <title>Fast and Efficient Postsynthetic DNA Labeling in Cells by Means of Strain&#8208;Promoted Sydnone&#8208;Alkyne Cycloadditions</title>

Fast and efficient: DNA strands, modified with the novel bioorthogonal reporters sydnones, undergo fast and efficient labeling with cyclooctynes and have the potential to become essential tools for imaging DNA and possibly RNA in cells.







Abstract
Sydnones are highly stable mesoionic 1,3&#8208;dipoles that react with cyclooctynes through strain&#8208;promoted sydnone&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (SPSAC). Although sydnones have been shown to be valuable bioorthogonal chemical reporters for the labeling of proteins and complex glycans, nucleic acids have not yet been tagged by SPSAC. Evaluation of SPSAC kinetics with model substrates showed fast reactions with cyclooctyne probes (up to k=0.59&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1), and two different sydnones were effectively incorporated into both 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyuridines at position 5, and 7&#8208;deaza&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyadenosines at position 7. These modified nucleosides were synthetically incorporated into single&#8208;stranded DNAs, which were successfully postsynthetically labeled with cyclooctyne probes both in&#8197;vitro and in cells. These results show that sydnones are versatile bioorthogonal tags and have the premise to become essential tools for tracking DNA and potentially RNA in living cells.

         <title>Accessing Extended Fused Isoindolinones Via Sequential Anionic Intramolecular Cyclizations</title>

Modelling was used to predict how stereoelectronic effects could be used for regio&#8208;control of 6&#8208;exo versus 7&#8208;endo nucleophilic cyclizations. This stereoelectronic effect was then used synthetically to provide access to fully conjugated and &#960;&#8208;extended isoindolinones.







Abstract
Sequential anionic intramolecular cyclizations and modelling were used for the first time to access unusual fused heterocyclic frameworks in excellent yields. 5&#8208;Exo&#8208;dig cyclizations yielded isoindolinone motifs and a subsequent 6&#8208;exo&#8208; and 7&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization was directed to provide either fused isoquinoline or azepine frameworks. Regioselectivities were controlled by exploiting stereoelectronic effects via nC&#8722;&#8594;&#960;*(Ph) interactions, and modelling studies provided reaction scope.

         <title>Macrocyclic Inorganic Tin&#8208;Containing Oxo Clusters: Heterometallic Strategy for Configuration and Catalytic Activity Modulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 65, Page 16117-16120, November 22, 2021. </description>

Unprecedented macrocyclic inorganic tin&#8208;containing oxo clusters have been successfully constructed, whose configuration, host&#8208;guest behaviors, supramolecular packing and catalytic activities are significantly modulated by the introduction of heterometals with different ionic radius.







Abstract
In this work, the first examples of inorganic macrocyclic tin&#8208;oxo clusters which are stabilized by sulfate ligands are reported. As determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction and photoelectron spectroscopy analyses, the prepared inorganic Sn10&#8208;oxo cluster displays interesting mixed valence behaviors, with 8 Sn4+ located at the cyclic skeleton and two Sn2+ encapsulated in the center. When further introducing Ti4+ and In3+ ions to the synthetic systems, heterometallic Sn2Ti6 and SnIn5Ti6 complexes with Ti6(SO4)9 and SnIn5(SO4)12 macrocyclic skeletons were prepared whose configuration and packing models were affected by the ionic radius of incorporated metals. Moreover, comparative CO2 reduction experiments confirm that such heterometallic composition can significantly improve the catalytic activities of these inorganic macrocyclic oxo clusters. This work represents a milestone in constructing inorganic tin complexes and also macrocyclic metal oxo clusters with tunable configurations and properties.

         <title>Turning the Light on Phenols: New Opportunities in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 65, Page 16062-16070, November 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phenols in the spotlight: Phenol and its derivatives are key moieties in organic chemistry. Conventionally, they are prepared through thermal functionalization strategies that present several drawbacks. Recently, alternative photochemical approaches have been implemented that involves phenols both as light&#8208;harvesting substrates or as photo&#8208;redox catalysts. This Minireview summarizes the most relevant examples within this field, highlighting the great versatility of simple phenolic frameworks in organic synthesis.







Abstract
Phenols (I) are extremely relevant chemical functionalities in natural, synthetic and industrial chemistry. Their corresponding electron&#8208;rich anions, namely phenolates (I), are characterized by interesting physicochemical properties that can be drastically altered upon light excitation. Specifically, phenolates (I) become strong reducing agents in the excited state and are able to generate reactive radicals from suitable precursors via single&#8208;electron transfer processes. Thus, these species can photochemically trigger strategic bond&#8208;forming reactions, including their direct aromatic C&#8722;H functionalization. Moreover, substituted phenolate anions can act as photocatalysts to enable synthetically useful organic transformations. An alternative mechanistic manifold is represented by the ability of phenolate derivatives I to form ground state electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes with electron&#8208;poor radical sources. These complementary scenarios have paved the way for the development of a wide range of relevant organic reactions. In this Minireview, we present the main examples of this research field, and give insight on emerging trends in phenols photocatalysis towards richer organic synthesis.

         <title>An ESIPT&#8208;dependent AIE fluorophore based on HBT derivative: substituent positional impact on aggregated luminescence and its application for hydrogen peroxide detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aiming to develop the facile organic fluorophore possessing excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), we designed and synthesized two isomers with different linkage site between hydroxyl of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl) benzothiazole (HBT) and a benzothiazole substituent (para position refers to  p&#8208;  BHBT  and ortho position refers to  o&#8208;  BHBT  ). Fluorescence emission properties of  p&#8208;  BHBT  and  o&#8208;  BHBT  in THF/water mixtures with different water volume fractions indicated an opposite luminescence in aggregates, in which  p&#8208;  BHBT  showed an ESIPT&#8208;dependent AIE properties while  o&#8208;  BHBT  displayed ESIPT effect and aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) qualities. A possible mechanism for molecular actions to illustrate the aggregating luminescence alteration of these two isomers had been proposed and verified by theoretical and experimental studies. More importantly,  Probe&#8208;1  , generated from dual ESIPT&#8208;AIE fluorophore  p&#8208;  BHBT  , was successfully used as a ratiometric fluorescent chemosensor for highly selective (above 15&#8208;fold over other ROS) and sensitive (69&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement with 0.22 &#956;M of detection limit) detection of hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solution and living cells, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic reduction of oximes to hydroxylamines: current methods, challenges and opportunities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic reduction of oximes represents a direct efficient approach to synthesize valuable hydroxylamine derivatives. However this transformation presents significant challenges: oximes are hard to reduce and, if reactive, reductive cleavage of the weak N&#8210;O bond often leads to primary amine side products. The first suitable systems involved the use of platinum&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts with hydrogen as reductant and stoichiometric amounts of a strong Br&#248;nsted acid. More recently metal&#8208;free and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based homogeneous catalysts have been developed, which display the highest turnovers (up to 4000). In the asymmetric variants, the  E/Z  &#8208;geometry of the oxime double bond affects significantly the stereoselectivity, sometimes requiring extra synthetic efforts in substrate preparation. This minireview provides an overview of the advances and limitations in catalytic oxime to hydroxylamine reduction. Emphasis is put on highlighting and comparing the practical aspects of the existing methods, such as their reaction conditions and substrate scope. Additionally, future directions for improving this young research area are suggested.</dc:description>

         <title>Accessing Cationic &#945;&#8208;Silylated and &#945;&#8208;Germylated Phosphorus Ylides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and full characterization of &#945;&#8208;silylated (&#945;&#8208;SiCPs, 1&#8208;7) and &#945;&#8208;germylated (&#945;&#8208;GeCPs) (11&#8208;13) phosphorus ylides bearing one chloride substituent R3PC(R1)E(Cl)R22 (R = Ph; R1 = Me, Et, Ph; R2 = Me, Et, iPr, Mes; E = Si, Ge) is presented. The molecular structures were determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. The title compounds were applied in halide abstraction studies in order to access cationic species. The reaction of Ph3PC(Me)Si(Cl)Me2 (1) with Na[B(C6F5)4] furnished the dimeric phosphonium&#8208;like dication [Ph3PC(Me)SiMe2]2[B(C6F5)4]2 (8). The highly reactive, mesityl&#8208; or iPr&#8208;substituted cationic species [Ph3PC(Me)SiMes2][B(C6F5)4] (9) and [Ph3PC(Et)SiiPr2][B(C6F5)4] (10) could be characterized by NMR spectroscopy. Carrying out the halide abstraction reaction in the sterically demanding ether iPr2O afforded the protonated &#945;&#8208;SiCP [Ph3PCH(Et)Si(Cl)iPr2][B(C6F5)4] (6dec) by sodium mediated basic ether decomposition, whereas successfully synthesized [Ph3PC(Et)SiiPr2][B(C6F5)4] (10) readily cleaves the F&#8211;C bond in fluorobenzene. Thus, the ambiphilic character of &#945;&#8208;SiCPs is clearly demonstrated. The less reactive germanium analogue [Ph3PC(Me)GeMes2][B(3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3)4] (14) was obtained by reacting 11 with Na[B(3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3)4] and fully characterized including X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Structural parameters indicate a strong CYlide&#8211;Ge interaction with high double bond character, and consequently the C&#8211;E (E = Si, Ge) bonds in 9, 10 and 14 were analyzed with NBO and AIM methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Naphthalene exchange in [Re(&#951;6&#8208;napht)2]+ with pharmaceuticals leads to highly functionalized sandwich complexes [M(&#951;6&#8208;pharm)2]+ (M=Re/99mTc)</title>

         <dc:description>Bis&#8208;arene sandwich complexes are generally prepared by the Fischer&#8208;Hafner reaction, which conditions are incompatible with most O&#8208; and N&#8208; functional groups.

N&#8208;methylpyrrolidine (NMP) facilitates the substitution of naphthalene with the incoming arene. A series of fully characterized rhenium sandwich complexes with simple arenes, such as aniline, as well as with active compounds like lidocaine and melatonin are presented. With these rhenium compounds in hand, the radioactive sandwich complexes [  99m  Tc(&#951;  6  &#8208;pharm)  2  ]  +  (pharm = pharmaceutical) can be unambiguously confirmed. The direct labelling of pharmaceuticals with  99m  Tc through &#951;  6  &#8208;coordination to phenyl rings and the confirmation of the structures with the rhenium homologues opens a path into molecular theranostics.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding the Effects of Binders in Gas Sorption and Acidity of Aluminum Fumarate Extrudates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the impact of shaping processes on solid adsorbents is critical for the implementation of MOFs in industrial separation processes or as catalytic materials. Production of MOF&#8208;containing shaped particles is typically associated with loss of porosity and modification of acid sites, two phenomena that affect their performance. Herein, we report a detailed study on how extrusion affects the crystallinity, porosity, and acidity of the aluminum fumarate MOF with clays or SiO  2  gel binders. Thorough characterization showed that the clay binders confer the extrudates a good mechanical robustness at the expense of porosity, while silica gel shows an opposite trend. The CO  2  selectivity towards CH  4,  of interest for natural gas separation processes, is maintained upon the extrusion process Moreover, probe FT&#8208;IR spectroscopy revealed no major changes in the types of acid sites. This study highlights that these abundant and inexpensive clay materials may be used for scaling MOFs as active adsorbents.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two new sodium aluminum borates, Na  3  AlB  8  O  15  and Na  3  Al  2  B  7  O  15  , have been successfully synthesized by the high&#8208;temperature solution method. They crystallize in the different space groups,  P  2  1  /  c  and  P  2/  c  , respectively. The B&#8208;O configurations of &#946;&#8208;Na  2  B  6  O  10  , Na  3  AlB  8  O  15  and Na  3  Al  2  B  7  O  15  are compared to feature complicated different dimensional open&#8208;framework structures caused by the substitution of [BO  4  ] by [AlO  4  ] covalent tetrahedra. Moreover, the experimental results indicate that Na  3  AlB  8  O  15  and Na  3  Al  2  B  7  O  15  have short ultraviolet (UV) cutoff edges (&lt;187 nm). The first&#8208;principles calculations show that Na  3  AlB  8  O  15  and Na  3  Al  2  B  7  O  15  have moderate birefringence (0.075 and 0.041 @1064 nm, respectively).</dc:description>

         <title>An isolable gallium&#8208;substituted nitrilimine and its reactivity with B&#8208;H, Si&#8208;H and B&#8208;B bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reaction of the Ga(I) compound NacNacGa (  9  ) with the diazo compound N  2  CHSiMe  3  affords the nitrilimine compound NacNacGa(N&#8208;NCSiMe  3  )(CH  2  SiMe  3  ) (  10  ). Carrying out this reaction in the presence of pyridine does not lead to C&#8208;H activation on the transient alkylidene NacNacGa=CHSiMe  3  , but generates a metallated diazo species NacNacGa(NHN=CHSiMe  3  )(CN  2  SiMe  3  ) (  13  ) that further rearranges into the isonitrile compound NacNac&#8208; Ga(NHN=CHSiMe  3  )(N(NC)SiMe  3  ) (  15  ). Reactions of  10  with the silane H  3  SiPh and the borane HBcat furnished products of 1,3 addition to the nitrilimine moiety NacNacGa{N(ER  n  )NCSiMe  3  }(CH  2  SiMe  3  ), whereas reaction with the diborane B  2  cat  2  gave the product of formal nitrene insertion into the B&#8208;B bond. DFT calculations suggest that the interaction of  9  with N  2  CHSiMe  3  proceeds via intermediate formation of an alkylidene compound that undergoes CH activation with a second molecule of N  2  CHSiMe  3  . Insertion into the B&#8208;B bond likely proceeds via an initial 1,3&#8208;addition of the diborane, followed by boryl migration to the former nitrene center.</dc:description>

         <title>Orthogonal Catalysis for an Enantioselective Domino Inverse&#8208;Electron Demand Diels&#8208;Alder / Substitution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An enantioselective domino process for the synthesis of substituted 1,2&#8208;dihydronaphthalenes has been developed, by the combination of chiral amines and a bidentate Lewis acid in an orthogonal catalysis. This new method is based on an inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder and a subsequent group exchange reaction. An enamine is generated in situ from an aldehyde and a chiral secondary amine catalyst which reacts with phthalazine, activated by the coordination to a bidentate Lewis acid catalyst. The absolute configuration of the product is controlled by chiral information provided by the amine. The formed  ortho  &#8208;quinodimethane intermediate is then transformed via a group exchange reaction with thiols. The new method shows a broad scope and tolerates a wide range of functional groups with enantiomeric ratios up to 91:9. All&#8208;in&#8208;all, this enantioselective synthesis tool provides an easy access to complex 1,2&#8208;dihydronaphthalenes starting from readily available phthalazine, aldehydes and thiols in a combinatorial way.</dc:description>

         <title>Interplay of Polarity and Confinement in Asymmetric Catalysis with Chiral Rh Diene Complexes in Microemulsions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doping the nanoscale confinement of microemulsions with cationic surfactants improves yield and chirality transfer in the Rh&#8208;catalyzed nucleophile additions.







Abstract
Microemulsions provide a unique opportunity to tailor the polarity and liquid confinement in asymmetric catalysis via nanoscale polar and nonpolar domains separated by a surfactant film. For chiral diene Rh complexes, the influence of counterion and surfactant film on the catalytic activity and enantioselectivity remained elusive. To explore this issue chiral norbornadiene Rh(X) complexes (X=OTf, OTs, OAc, PO2F2) were synthesized and characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography and theoretical calculations. These complexes were used in Rh&#8208;catalyzed 1,2&#8208;additions of phenylboroxine to N&#8208;tosylimine in microemulsions stabilized either exclusively by n&#8208;octyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;glucopyranoside (C8G1) or a C8G1&#8208;film doped with anionic or cationic surfactants (AOT, SDS and DTAB). The Rh(OAc) complex showed the largest dependence on the composition of the microemulsion, yielding up to 59&#8201;% (90&#8201;%ee) for the surfactant film doped with 5&#8197;wt% of AOT as compared to 52&#8201;% (58&#8201;%ee) for neat C8G1 at constant surfactant concentration. Larger domains, determined by SAXS analysis, enabled further increase in yield and selectivity while the reaction rate almost remained constant according to kinetic studies.

         <title>Metallodrug Profiling against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Target Proteins Identifies Highly Potent Inhibitors of the S/ACE2 interaction and the Papain&#8208;like Protease PLpro</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite their increasing relevance in medicinal chemistry, metal complexes are still underrepresented in compound screening libraries for drug discovery. In this work more than 100 metal complexes were evaluated as inhibitors of two targets in the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 life cycle, the interaction of the spike protein with the ACE2 receptor and the protease PLpro. The most active inhibitors were studied for antiviral effects in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infected cells and led to the discovery of active compounds that will provide starting points for future drug design.







Abstract
The global spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) has called for an urgent need for dedicated antiviral therapeutics. Metal complexes are commonly underrepresented in compound libraries that are used for screening in drug discovery campaigns, however, there is growing evidence for their role in medicinal chemistry. Based on previous results, we have selected more than 100&#8197;structurally diverse metal complexes for profiling as inhibitors of two relevant SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 replication mechanisms, namely the interaction of the spike (S) protein with the ACE2 receptor and the papain&#8208;like protease PLpro. In addition to many well&#8208;established types of mononuclear experimental metallodrugs, the pool of compounds tested was extended to approved metal&#8208;based therapeutics such as silver sulfadiazine and thiomersal, as well as polyoxometalates (POMs). Among the mononuclear metal complexes, only a small number of active inhibitors of the S/ACE2 interaction was identified, with titanocene dichloride as the only strong inhibitor. However, among the gold and silver containing complexes many turned out to be very potent inhibitors of PLpro activity. Highly promising activity against both targets was noted for many POMs. Selected complexes were evaluated in antiviral SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 assays confirming activity for gold complexes with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) or dithiocarbamato ligands, a silver NHC complex, titanocene dichloride as well as a POM compound. These studies might provide starting points for the design of metal&#8208;based SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 antiviral agents.

         <dc:description>Development of new n&#8208;type one&#8208;dimensional (1D) self&#8208;assembly nanostructure and a clear understanding of the relationship between molecular structure and self&#8208;assembly behavior are important prerequisites for further designing and optimizing organic optoelectronic nanodevice. In this article, a series of n&#8208;type organic semiconductor materials based on pyrene imide were successfully synthesized through [4+2] cycloaddition reactions and their preliminary optical and electrochemical properties were studied. The simulated HOMO&#8208;LUMO bandgaps via DFT tallied with the experimental data well. The self&#8208;assembly of these materials showed needle or fiber&#8208;like morphologies, indicating that different conjugation degree or alkyl group had significant influence on their self&#8208;assembly behaviors. Furthermore, the single&#8208;crystal packing for these molecules were analyzed and it was found out that the changes of conjugated backbone and functional group would affect certain crystal lattice parameter significantly, such as the intermolecular packing distance and crystal size etc, which would further result in different self&#8208;assembly morphology.</dc:description>

         <title>Monitoring the thiol/thiophenol molecule&#8208;modulated plasmon&#8208;mediated silver oxidation with dark&#8208;field optical microscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface plasmon can trigger or accelerate many photochemical reactions, especially useful in energy and environmental industries. Recently, molecular adsorption has been proved effective in modulating the plasmon&#8208;mediated photochemistry, however the realized chemical reactions are limited and the mechanism behind is still unclear. Herein, by using  in situ  dark&#8208;field optical microscopy, the plasmon&#8208;mediated oxidative etching of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs), a typical hot&#8208;hole&#8208;driven reaction, is monitored continuously and quantitatively. The presence of thiol or thiophenol molecules is found essential in the silver oxidation. In addition, the rate of silver oxidation is modulated by the choice of different thiol or thiophenol molecules. Compared with the molecules having electron donating groups, the ones having electron accepting groups accelerate the silver oxidation dramatically. The thiol/thiophenol modulation is attributed to the modulation of the charge separation between the Ag NPs and the adsorbed thiol or thiophenol molecules. This work demonstrates the great potential of molecular adsorption in modulating the plasmon&#8208;mediated photochemistry, which will pave a new way for developing highly efficient plasmonic photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Iridium(III) Complexes with [&#8722;2, &#8722;1, 0] Charged Ligand Realized Deep&#8208;Red/Near&#8208;Infrared Phosphorescent Emission</title>

         <dc:description>
New [&#8722;2, &#8722;1, 0] charged&#8208;ligand based iridium(III) complexes with simple chemical structures, good thermal stability and easy sublimability were designed and synthesized for the construction of novel phosphorescent iridium(III) complex materials. Deep red/near&#8208;infrared emissions were observed both in their photoluminescence and electroluminescence. This work provides a new idea for the construction of new type phosphorescent Ir(III) emitters with different charged ligands, thus offering new opportunities and challenges for their optoelectronic applications.







Abstract
A series of [&#8722;2, &#8722;1, 0] charged&#8208;ligand based iridium(III) complexes of [Ir(bph)(bpy)(acac)] (1), [Ir(bph)(2MeO&#8208;bpy)(acac)] (2), [Ir(bph)(2CF3&#8208;bpy)(acac)] (3), [Ir(bph)(bpy)(2tBu&#8208;acac)] (4) and [Ir(bph)(bpy)(CF3&#8208;acac)] (5), which using biphenyl as dianionic ligand [&#8722;2], acetylacetone (or its derivatives) as monoanionic ligand [&#8722;1], and 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (or its derivatives) as neutral ligand [0] were designed and synthesized. The chemical structures were well characterized. All of the ligands have simple chemical structures, thus further making the complexes have excellent thermal stability and are easy to sublimate and purify. Phosphorescent characteristics with short emission lifetime were demonstrated for these emitters. Notably, all of the complexes exhibit remarkable deep red/near infrared emission, which is quite different from the reported [&#8722;1, &#8722;1, &#8722;1] charged&#8208;ligand based iridium(III) complexes. The photophysical properties of these complexes are regularly improved by introducing electron&#8208;donating or &#8208;withdrawing groups into [&#8722;1] or [0] charged&#8208;ligand. The related organic light&#8208;emitting diodes exhibited deep red/near infrared emission with acceptable external quantum efficiency and low turn&#8208;on voltage (&lt;2.6&#8197;V). This work provides a new idea for the construction of new type phosphorescent iridium(III) emitters with different valence states of [&#8722;2, &#8722;1, 0] charged ligands, thus offering new opportunities and challenges for their optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Analysis of NH3&#8208;TPD Profiles for CuSSZ&#8208;13 SCR Catalyst of Controlled Al Distribution &#8211; Complexity Resolved by First Principles Thermodynamics of NH3 Desorption, IR and EPR Insight into Cu Speciation**

         <dc:description>
Interpretation of NH3&#8208;TPD results, which takes into account the temperature&#8208;induced dynamics of NH3 interaction with the active centers of CuSSZ&#8208;13 is proposed. It is based on DFT/GGA+D and first principles thermodynamic modeling of various monomeric and polymeric Cu species, segregated CuO and Br&#248;nsted acid sites. Comprehensive interpretation includes Cu reduction, its relocation and oxolation, which are concomitant with ammonia desorption.







Abstract
NH3 temperature&#8208;programmed desorption (NH3&#8208;TPD) is frequently used for probing the nature of the active sites in CuSSZ&#8208;13 zeolite for selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx. Herein, we propose an interpretation of NH3&#8208;TPD results, which takes into account the temperature&#8208;induced dynamics of NH3 interaction with the active centers. It is based on a comprehensive DFT/GGA+D and first&#8208;principles thermodynamic (FPT) modeling of NH3 adsorption on single Cu2+, Cu+, [CuOH]+ centers, dimeric [Cu&#8208;O&#8208;Cu]2+, [Cu&#8208;O22&#8722;&#8208;Cu]2 species, segregated CuO nanocrystals and Br&#248;nsted acid sites (BAS). Theoretical TPD profiles are compared with the experimental data measured for samples of various Si/Al ratios and distribution of Al within the zeolite framework. Copper reduction, its relocation, followed by the intrazeolite olation/oxolation processes, which are concomitant with NH3 desorption, were revealed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and IR. DFT/FPT results show that the peaks in the desorption profiles cannot be assigned univocally to the particular Cu and BAS centers, since the observed low&#8208;, medium&#8208; and high&#8208;temperature desorption bands have contributions coming from several species, which dynamically change their speciation and redox states during NH3&#8208;TPD experiment. Thus, a rigorous interpretation of the NH3&#8208;TPD profiles of CuSSZ&#8208;13 in terms of the strength and concentration of the active centers of a particular type is problematic. Nonetheless, useful connections for molecular interpretation of TPD profiles can be established between the individual component peaks and the corresponding ensembles of the adsorption centers.

         <title>Catechol Moiety Integrated Tri&#8208;Aryl Type AIEgen for Visual and Quantitative Boronic Acid Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double feature: Functional AIEgen TA&#8208;Catechol with dual&#8208;mode detection capability towards series of boronic acids is presented. Photoluminescent properties of TA&#8208;Catechol are studied thoroughly both experimentally and theoretically. Detection performance is estimated for visual and quantitative mode while formation of tetra&#8208;coordinated boronic compound is confirmed to dominate the sensing procedure. Solid&#8208;state recognition and potential applications are discussed.







Abstract
Novel functional AIEgen based on three compact bound aryl skeletons is designed and synthesized. This tri&#8208;aryl type luminogen (TA&#8208;Catechol) embedded with catechol moiety responds rapidly to series of boronic acids. Real&#8208;time visual and quantitative dual&#8208;mode detection method is established for the first time with modest precision and low detection limit (8.0&#8197;&#956;M). Detailed mechanistic discussion identifies tetra&#8208;coordinated boronic species as the key intermediate within sensing procedure. Wide range of organic boronic acids compatible with this strategy is displayed which is promising in high throughput screening technology. Furthermore, solid&#8208;state sensing capability of TA&#8208;Catechol is also demonstrated.

</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mediated synthesis: A strategy for the nickel&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of ketones using visible light and two carboxylic acid&#8208;derived substrates is presented. No expensive iridium catalysts are required, with eco&#8208;friendly Hantzsch ester acting as both the photosensitizer and photoreductant. A broad scope of synthesized ketones is presented along with spectroscopical and computational studies of the role of the different reactants.

A simple visible light photochemical, nickel&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of ketones from carboxylic acid&#8208;derived precursors is presented. Hantzsch ester (HE) functions as a cheap, green and strong photoreductant to facilitate radical generation and also engages in the Ni&#8208;catalytic cycle to restore the reactive species. With this dual role, HE allows for the coupling of a large variety of radicals (1&#176;,2&#176;, benzylic, &#945;&#8208;oxy &amp; &#945;&#8208;amino) with aroyl and alkanoyl moieties, a new feature in reactions of this type. With both precursors deriving from abundant carboxylic acids, this protocol is a welcome addition to the organic chemistry toolbox. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions without the need for toxic metal reagents or bases and shows a wide scope, including pharmaceuticals and complex molecular architectures.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mediated synthesis&lt;/b&gt;: A strategy for the nickel-catalyzed synthesis of ketones using visible light and two carboxylic acid-derived substrates is presented. No expensive iridium catalysts are required, with eco-friendly Hantzsch ester acting as both the photosensitizer and photoreductant. A broad scope of synthesized ketones is presented along with spectroscopical and computational studies of the role of the different reactants.

The reaction of [(NacnacNi)2tol] with white phosphorus, yellow arsenic and the interpnictogen compound AsP3 leads in dependence of the temperature to different complexes ([(NacnacNi)2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;2,&#954;1:&#951;2,&#954;1&#8208;E4)] and the paramagnetic [(NacnacNi)2(&#956;,&#951;3&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8208;E3)] (E=P, As)). The reduction was performed with KC8 and leads to similar but also different structured products. Thus, a large variety of different polypnictogen units are formed coordinated by nickel nacnac complexes.







Abstract
The reactivity of white phosphorus and yellow arsenic towards two different nickel nacnac complexes is investigated. The nickel complexes [(L1Ni)2tol] (1, L1=[{N(C6H3iPr2&#8208;2,6)C(Me)}2CH]&#8722;) and [K2][(L1Ni)2(&#956;,&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8208;N2)] (6) were reacted with P4, As4 and the interpnictogen compound AsP3, respectively, yielding the homobimetallic complexes [(L1Ni)2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;2,&#954;1:&#951;2,&#954;1&#8208;E4)] (E=P (2&#8201;a), As (2&#8201;b), AsP3 (2&#8201;c)), [(L1Ni)2(&#956;,&#951;3&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8208;E3)] (E=P (3&#8201;a), As (3&#8201;b)) and [K@18&#8208;c&#8208;6(thf)2][L1Ni(&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8208;E4)] (E=P (7&#8201;a), As (7&#8201;b)), respectively. Heating of 2&#8201;a, 2&#8201;b or 2&#8201;c also leads to the formation of 3&#8201;a or 3&#8201;b. Furthermore, the reactivity of these compounds towards reduction agents was investigated, leading to [K2][(L1Ni)2(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8208;P4)] (4) and [K@18&#8208;c&#8208;6(thf)3][(L1Ni)2(&#956;,&#951;3&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8208;E3)] (E=P (5&#8201;a), As (5&#8201;b)), respectively. Compound 4 shows an unusual planarization of the initial Ni2P4&#8208;prism. All products were comprehensively characterized by crystallographic and spectroscopic methods.

         <title>Acid&#8208;Catalyzed RNA&#8208;Oligomerization from 3&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;cGMP</title>

Shedding new light on an old mechanism: Previous studies have suggested that the polymerization of 3&#8217;,5&#8217; cyclic guanosine monophosphate proceeds according to a base&#8208;catalyzed mechanism. In contrast, our work supports an acid&#8208;catalyzed reaction route that benefits from the unique ability of the free&#8208;acid form monomers to crystallize, and thus form highly ordered supramolecular architectures. The reaction could serve as a source of the most ancient short oligonucleotide sequences on our planet.







Abstract
The assembly of ancient informational polymers from nucleotide precursors is the central challenge of life's origin on our planet. Among the possible solutions, dry polymerization of 3&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;cyclic guanosine monophosphate (3&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;cGMP) has been proposed as a candidate to create oligonucleotides of 15&#8211;20&#8197;units in length. However, the reported sensitivity of the reaction to the presence of cations raised questions of whether this chemistry could be relevant in a geological context. The experiments in this study show that the presence of cations is not restrictive as long as the reaction is conducted in an acidic environment, in contrast to previous reports that suggested optimal conditions at pH&#8197;9.

         <title>Unveiling the Unique Roles of Metal Coordination and Modulator in the Polymorphism Control of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The extraordinary coordination versatility of Th4+ cation and the unexpected bridging role of formate allow polymorphism control of thorium&#8208;organic frameworks (TOFs) with five distinct phases, wherein the highest degree of interpenetration and porosity for TOFs have been achieved. The resulting TOFs exhibit considerably different adsorption behaviors toward organic dyes, thus suggesting that TOFs represent an excellent platform for structure&#8208;property relationship study.







Abstract
Polymorphism control of metal&#8208;organic frameworks is highly desired for elucidating structure&#8208;property relationships, but remains an empirical process and is usually done in a trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approach. We adopted the rarely used actinide cation Th4+ and a ditopic linker to construct a series of thorium&#8208;organic frameworks (TOFs) with a range of polymorphs. The extraordinary coordination versatility of Th4+ cations and clusters, coupled with synthetic modulation, gives five distinct phases, wherein the highest degree of interpenetration (threefold) and porosity (75.9&#8201;%) of TOFs have been achieved. Notably, the O atom on the capping site of the nine&#8208;coordinated Th4+ cation can function as a bridging unit to interconnect neighboring secondary building units (SBUs), affording topologies that are undocumented for other tetravalent&#8208;metal&#8208;containing MOFs. Furthermore, for the first time HCOOH has been demonstrated as a bridging unit of SBUs to further induce structural complexity. The resulting TOFs exhibit considerably different adsorption behaviors toward organic dyes, thus suggesting that TOFs represent an exceptional and promising platform for structure&#8208;property relationship study.

         <title>Tuning the Reactivity of a Substrate for SNAP&#8208;Tag Expands Its Application for Recognition&#8208;Driven DNA&#8208;Protein Conjugation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein modular adaptors (MAs) are the ideal reaction model for recognition&#8208;driven modification of DNA as they contain both a sequence&#8208;specific DNA&#8208;binding domain and a self&#8208;ligating protein&#8208;tag. We have designed new substrates of SNAP&#8208;tag to realize sequence&#8208;selective rapid crosslinking by protein MAs with SNAP&#8208;tag.







Abstract
Recognition&#8208;driven modification has been emerging as a novel approach to modifying biomolecular targets of interest site&#8208;specifically and efficiently. To this end, protein modular adaptors (MAs) are the ideal reaction model for recognition&#8208;driven modification of DNA as they consist of both a sequence&#8208;specific DNA&#8208;binding domain (DBD) and a self&#8208;ligating protein&#8208;tag. Coupling DNA recognition by DBD and the chemoselective reaction of the protein tag could provide a highly efficient sequence&#8208;specific reaction. However, combining an MA consisting of a reactive protein&#8208;tag and its substrate, for example, SNAP&#8208;tag and benzyl guanine (BG), revealed rather nonselective reaction with DNA. Therefore new substrates of SNAP&#8208;tag have been designed to realize sequence&#8208;selective rapid crosslinking reactions of MAs with SNAP&#8208;tag. The reactions of substrates with SNAP&#8208;tag were verified by kinetic analyses to enable the sequence&#8208;selective crosslinking reaction of MA. The new substrate enables the distinctive orthogonality of SNAP&#8208;tag against CLIP&#8208;tag to achieve orthogonal DNA&#8208;protein crosslinking by six unique MAs.

         <title>Dinuclear Zinc Catalyzed Enantioselective Dearomatization [3+2] Annulation of 2&#8208;Nitrobenzofurans and 2&#8208;Nitrobenzothiophenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective dearomatization [3+2] annulation of 2&#8208;nitrobenzofurans and 2&#8208;nitrobenzothiophenes is realized by a dinuclear zinc catalyst, giving structurally diverse polycyclic pyrrolidinyl spirooxindoles with high enantioselectivity. This work represents the first application of a dinuclear zinc catalyst in an asymmetric dearomatization reaction.







Abstract
The application of dinuclear zinc catalysts in a dearomatization reaction has been developed. Catalytic asymmetric dearomatization [3+2] annulations of 2&#8208;nitrobenzofurans or 2&#8208;nitrobenzothiophenes with CF3&#8208;containing N&#8208;unprotected isatin&#8208;derived azomethine ylides catalyzed by dinuclear zinc catalysts are realized with excellent diastereomer ratios (dr) of &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 and enantiomeric excess (ee) of up to 99&#8201;%. This protocol provides a practical, straightforward access to structurally diverse pyrrolidinyl spirooxindoles containing a 2,3&#8208;fused&#8208;dihydrobenzofuran (or dihydrobenzothiphene) moiety, and four contiguous stereocenters. Reactions can be performed on a gram scale. The absolute configuration of products is confirmed by X&#8208;ray single crystal structure analysis, and a possible mechanism is proposed.

         <title>Tuning Ruthenium Carbene Complexes for Selective P&#8722;H Activation through Metal&#8208;Ligand Cooperation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
P&#8722;H bond activation is an important step in many catalytic applications involving the formation of new P&#8722;C bonds. The icebreaker &#8220;RV Bond Activation&#8221;, which symbolizes our carbene complexes depicted by the constellation in the sky, is able to easily break P&#8722;H bonds via the carbene linkage. The splitting of phosphines into protons and phosphide fragments (depicted as ice shards flying away) occurs even at low temperatures. More information can be found in the Full Paper by V.&#8197;H. Gessner et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103151).

         <title>Stimuli Induced Uptake of Protein&#8208;Like Peptide Brush Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, we presented a strategy for packaging peptides as side&#8208;chains in high&#8208;density brush polymers. For this globular protein&#8208;like polymer (PLP) formulation, therapeutic peptides were shown to resist proteolytic degradation, enter cells efficiently and maintain biological function. In this paper, we establish the role charge plays in dictating the cellular uptake of these peptide formulations, finding that peptides with a net positive charge will enter cells when polymerized, while those formed from anionic or neutral peptides remain outside of cells. Given these findings, we explored whether cellular uptake could be selectively induced by a stimulus. In our design, a cationic peptide is appended to a sequence of charge&#8208;neutralizing anionic amino acids via stimuli&#8208;responsive cleavable linkers. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, we tested this strategy with two different classes of stimuli, exogenous UV light and an enzyme (a matrix metalloproteinase) associated with the inflammatory response. The key finding is that these materials enter cells only when acted upon by the stimulus. This approach makes it possible to achieve delivery of the polymers, therapeutic peptides or an appended cargo into cells in response to an appropriate stimulus.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The prebiotic emergence of molecules capable of both self&#8208;replication and of storing information was a defining event at the dawn of life. Still, a plausibly prebiotic self&#8208;replication of biologically relevant molecules has not been demonstrated. Building upon the known templating nature of amyloids we present two systems in which the products of a peptide bond&#8208;forming reaction act as self&#8208;replicators to enhance the yield and stereoselectivity of their formation. This first report of an amino acid condensation reaction that can undergo autocatalysis further supports the potential role of amyloids in prebiotic molecular evolution as an environment&#8208;responsive and information&#8208;coding system capable of self&#8208;replication.</dc:description>

Sandwich time! In a study giving new ideas on the design of anion receptors, very strong anion&#8208;&#960; and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;anion interactions were calculated between halides and aromatic ligands in transition&#8208;metal half&#8208;sandwich compounds with electron&#8208;withdrawing ligands. The strongest interactions surpass the energy of &#8722;20&#8197;kcal/mol, which is stronger than anion&#8208;&#960; and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;anion interactions between halides and organic aromatic molecules.







Abstract
Half&#8208;sandwich compounds of benzene, cyclopentadienyl, pentamethylcyclopentadienyl, and indenyl were studied as a new type of aromatic &#960;&#8208;systems for interactions with halide anions. Although uncoordinated benzene forms only C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;anion interactions, and hexafluorobenzene forms only anion&#8208;&#960; interactions, aromatic ligands in half&#8208;sandwich compounds can form both types of interactions, because their entire electrostatic potential surface is positive. These aromatic ligands can form stronger anion&#8208;&#960; interactions than organic aromatic molecules, as a consequence of more pronounced dispersion and induction energy components. Moreover, C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;anion interactions of aromatic ligands are stronger than anion&#8208;&#960; interactions, and significantly stronger than C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;anion interactions of benzene. Our study shows that transition&#8208;metal coordination can make aromatic moieties suitable for strong interactions with anions, and gives insight into the design of new anion receptors.

         <title>4&#8208;Iodopyrimidine Labeling Reveals Nuclear Translocation and Nuclease Activity for Both MIF and MIF2**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein trafficking is an essential step for the functionalization of proteins. We report a 4&#8208;iodopyrimidine based probe 8 for the selective labeling of MIF and MIF2. This enabled monitoring of the translocation of MIF2 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus upon methylnitronitrosoguanidine stimulation, which indicates a nuclease activity for MIF2 on human genomic DNA. Thus, we provide a tool for MIF and MIF2 localization study, as well as demonstrate a nuclease activity for MIF2.







Abstract
Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and its homolog MIF2 (also known as D&#8208;dopachrome tautomerase or DDT) play key roles in cell growth and immune responses. MIF and MIF2 expression is dysregulated in cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. Accurate and convenient detection of MIF and MIF2 will facilitate research on their roles in cancer and other diseases. Herein, we report the development and application of a 4&#8208;iodopyrimidine based probe 8 for the selective labeling of MIF and MIF2. Probe 8 incorporates a fluorophore that allows in&#8197;situ imaging of these two proteins. This enabled visualization of the translocation of MIF2 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus upon methylnitronitrosoguanidine stimulation of HeLa cells. This observation, combined with literature on nuclease activity for MIF, enabled the identification of nuclease activity for MIF2 on human genomic DNA.

         <title>Pushing the limits of characterising a weak halogen bond in solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Detection and characterisation of very weak, non&#8208;covalent interactions in solution is inherently challenging. Low affinity, short complex lifetime and a constant battle against entropy brings even the most sensitive spectroscopic methods to their knees. Herein we introduce a strategy for the accurate experimental description of weak chemical forces in solution. Its scope is demonstrated by the detailed geometric and thermodynamic characterisation of the weak halogen bond of a non&#8209;fluorinated aryl iodide and an ether oxygen (0.6&#160;kJ mol  &#8209;1  ). Our approach makes use of the entropic advantage of studying a weak force intramolecularly, embedded into a cooperatively folding system, and of the combined use of NOE&#8208; and RDC&#8208;based ensemble analyses to accurately describe the orientation of the donor and acceptor sites. Thermodynamic constants (&#916;G, &#916;H and &#916;S), describing the specific interaction, were derived from variable temperature chemical shift analysis. We present a methodology for the experimental investigation of remarkably weak halogen bonds and other related weak forces in solution, paving the way for their improved understanding and strategic use in chemistry and biology.</dc:description>

         <title>Thiophene&#8208;Fused 1,4&#8208;Diazapentalene: A Stable C=N&#8208;Containing &#960;&#8208;Conjugated System with Restored Antiaromaticity</title>

         <dc:description>
Best of both worlds: The thiophene&#8208;fused 1,4&#8208;diazapentalene with two C=N bonds (TAP) was synthesized as a stable compound. The fused thiophene rings restored the antiaromatic character of the 8&#960;&#8208;electron system diminished by C=N doping while imparting thermal stability. TAP readily underwent hydrogenation owing to the pronounced aromaticity of the hydrogenated product. Moreover, the high electrophilicity of C=N bonds of TAP led to dense &#960;&#8208;stacking in the solid state.







Abstract
A thiophene&#8208;fused 1,4&#8208;diazapentalene (TAP) was rationally designed and synthesized as a C=N&#8208;containing 4n&#8201;&#960;&#8208;electron system that exhibits restored antiaromaticity impaired by the doping with C=N bonds. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and quantum chemical calculations revealed that the annulation of thiophene rings with the 1,4&#8208;diazapentalene moiety resulted in a much higher antiaromaticity than the pristine 1,4&#8208;diazapentalene. These effects can be ascribed to the reduced bond alternation of the eight&#8208;membered&#8208;ring periphery caused by stabilization of the less&#8208;stable bond&#8208;shifted resonance structure upon increasing the degree of substitution of imine moieties. Consequently, TAP underwent facile hydrogenation even under mild conditions because of its pronounced antiaromaticity and the high aromaticity of the corresponding hydrogenated product H2&#8208;TAP. In addition, the electrophilic C=N moieties in TAP led to the formation of a dense &#960;&#8208;stacked structure. These results highlight the effect of partial replacement of C=C bonds with C=N bonds in antiaromatic &#960;&#8208;electron systems.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report on the synthesis of a microporous, three&#8208;dimensional phosphonate metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) with the composition Cu  3  (H  5  &#8208;MTPPA)  2  &#183;2 NMP (H  8  &#8208;MTPPA = methane tetra&#8208;  p  &#8208;phenylphosphonic acid and NMP = N&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyrrolidone). This MOF, termed TUB1, has a unique one&#8208;dimensional inorganic building unit composed of square planar and distorted trigonal bipyramidal copper atoms. It possesses a (calculated) BET surface area of 766.2 m  2  /g after removal of the solvents from the voids. The Tauc plot for TUB1 yields indirect and direct band gaps of 2.4 eV and 2.7 eV, respectively. DFT calculations reveal the existence of two spin&#8208;dependent gaps of 2.60 eV and 0.48 eV for the alpha and beta spins, respectively, with the lowest unoccupied crystal orbital for both gaps predominantly residing on the square planar copper atoms. The projected density of states suggests that the presence of the square planar copper atoms reduces the overall band gap of TUB1, as the beta&#8208;gap for the trigonal bipyramidal copper atoms is 3.72 eV.</dc:description>

The projected density of states suggests that the presence of the square planar copper atoms reduces the overall band gap of TUB1, as the beta-gap for the trigonal bipyramidal copper atoms is 3.72 eV.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photo&#8208; and electrochemical dual&#8208;responsive iridium probe for saccharide detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sensing strategies for dual detection systems are of interest for rapid, accurate data collection in  in vitro  testing. We introduce an Ir(III) complex with a boronic acid binding receptor site on the 2&#8208;phenylpyridine ligand as an ideal probe with photo&#8208; and electro&#8208; chemical signals, sensitive to changes of monosaccharide binding. The complex displays orange luminescence at 618 nm which is reduced in intensity upon binding of the monosaccharides, 70 % and 40% for fructose and glucose, respectively. The electrochemiluminescent signal of the complex shows a direct response to monosaccharide binding. The complex&#8217;s luminescence is also responsive to monosaccharide presence in cancer cells. The Ir(III) complex shows the same response upon incorporation into hydrogel matrices, demonstrating the potential of its integration into a device, as a non&#8208;toxic, simple to use tool to observe sugar binding in physiologically relevant pH ranges and saccharide concentrations.</dc:description>

         <title>THE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OF A SECOND METAL ON THE ANTIPROLIFERATIVE PROPERTIES OF THE COMPLEX [Ru(&#951;6&#8208;C10H14)(Cl2)(dmoPTA)].</title>

The crystal structure of 1, 3 and 5 were obtained by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Antiproliferative activity of the complexes was evaluated against colon cancer cell line Caco&#8208;2/TC7 by using the MTT protocol. The monometallic ruthenium complexes 1 and 2 were found to be inactive but the bimetallic complexes 3, 4 and 5 display an increased activity (IC  50  3: 9.07&#177;0.27; IC  50  4: 5.40&#177;0.19; IC  50  5: 7.15&#177;0.30 (&#181;M)) compared to cisplatin (IC  50  = 45.6&#177;8.08 &#181;M). Importantly, no reduction in normal cell viability was observed in the presence of the complexes. Experiments targeted to obtain information on the possible action mechanism of complexes were performed such as cell cycle, ROS and gene expression studies. The result obtained showed that the complexes display different properties and action mechanism depending on the nature of metal, M, bonded to the CH  3  N  dmoPTA  atoms.</dc:description>

         <title>Mn12&#8208;acetate complexes studied as single molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The phenomenon of single molecule magnet (SMM) behaviour of mixed valent Mn  12  coordination clusters of general formula [Mn  III  8  Mn  IV  4  O  12  (RCOO)  16  (H  2  O)  4  ] was exemplified by bulk samples of the archetypal [Mn  III  8  Mn  IV  4  O  12  (CH  3  COO)  16  (H  2  O)  4  ] molecule. The molecular origin of the observed magnetic behaviour has found support from extensive studies on the Mn  12  system within crystalline material or on molecules attached to a variety of surfaces. Here we report the magnetic signature of the isolated cationic species [Mn  12  O  12  (CH  3  COO)  15  (CH  3  CN)]  +  by gas phase X&#8208;ray Magnetic Circular Dichroism (XMCD) spectroscopy closely resembling that of the corresponding bulk samples. Furthermore, we report broken symmetry DFT calculations of spin densities and single ion tensors of the isolated, optimized complexes [Mn  12  O  12  (CH  3  COO)  15  (CH  3  CN)]  +  , [Mn  12  O  12  (CH  3  COO)  16  ], [Mn  12  O  12  (CH  3  COO)  16  (H  2  O)  4  ], and [Mn  III  8  Mn  IV  4  O  12  (CH  3  COO)  16  (H  2  O)  4  ]  (bulk geometry)  . The found magnetic fingerprints &#8211; experiment and theory alike &#8208; are of a remarkable robustness: The Mn  IV  4  core bears almost no magnetic anisotropy while the surrounding Mn  III  8  ring is highly anisotropic. These signatures are truly intrinsic properties of the Mn  12  core scaffold within all of these complexes and largely void of the environment. This likely holds irrespective of bulk packing effects.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A promising strategy of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) sensitized circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) has been proposed for improving the electroluminescence efficiencies of circularly polarized fluorescent emitters. Compared with chiral TADF emitters which suffer from the dilemma of small &#8710;  E  ST  accompanied by small  k  r  , the TADF&#8208;sensitized CPL (TSCP) strategy using TADF molecules as sensitizers and CP&#8208;FL molecules as emitters might be the most promising method to construct high&#8208;performance circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs). Consequently, by taking advantage of the theoretically 100% exciton utilization of TADF sensitizers, especially, by designing CP&#8208;FL emitters with high PLQY, narrow FWHM and large g  lum  values, TSCP&#8208;type CP&#8208;OLEDs with excellent overall performances can be realized.</dc:description>

         <title>The Shuttling Cascade in Lasso Peptide Benenodin&#8208;1 is Controlled by Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The lasso peptide benenodin&#8208;1, a naturally occurring and bacterially produced [1]rotaxane, undergoes a reversible zip tie&#8208;like motion under heat activation, in which a peptidic wheel stepwise translates along a molecular thread in a cascade of &#8220;tail/loop pulling&#8221; equilibria. Conformational and structural analyses of four translational isomers, in solution and in the gas phase, reveal that the equilibrium distribution is controlled by mechanical and non&#8208;covalent forces within the lasso peptide. Furthermore, each dynamic pulling step is accompanied by a major restructuring of the intramolecular hydrogen bonding network between wheel and thread, which affects the peptide&#8217;s physico&#8208;chemical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Domino Dehydrative &#960;&#8208;Extension: A Facile Path to Extended Perylenes and Terrylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective activation of identical functional groups is one of the most challenging tasks in the realm of organic chemistry. Dehydrative &#960;&#8208;extensions (DPEX) is a reaction that distinguishes &#8220;active&#8221; and &#8220;dormant&#8221; aldehyde groups based on their position and ability to participate in intramolecular reactions. This unusual feature allows the method to be used for programmed domino folding, in which aldehyde groups are activated sequentially in accordance with the program inbuilt into the precursor's structure. More information can be found in the Communication by K. Amsharov et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103098).

         <title>Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Haloalkynylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal catalysts can be used to react haloacetylenes with unsaturated compounds such as arynes, alkenes and alkynes, whereby the alkynyl unit and the halogen atom are usually added to adjacent positions. Cu, Pd and Au metal complexes have so far proved to be particularly suitable catalysts. The choice of catalyst system decisively determines the regio&#8208; and stereochemistry of the resulting halogenated product.







Abstract
Metal catalysis has revolutionized synthetic chemistry, leading to entirely new, very efficient transformations, which enable access to complex functionalized molecules. One such new transformation method is the haloalkynylation reaction, in which both a halogen atom and an alkynyl unit are transferred to an unsaturated carbon&#8208;carbon bond. This minireview summarizes the development of metal&#8208;catalyzed haloalkynylation reactions since their beginning about a decade ago. So far, arynes, alkenes and alkynes have been used as unsaturated systems and the reactivities of these systems are summarized in individual chapters of the minireview. Especially, the last few years have witnessed a rapid development due to gold&#8208;catalyzed reactions. Here, we discuss how the choice of the catalytic system influences the regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity of the addition.

         <title>Rhodium Indenyl NHC and Fluorenyl&#8208;Tethered NHC Half&#8208;Sandwich Complexes: Synthesis, Structures and Applications in the Catalytic C&#8722;H Borylation of Arenes and Alkanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indenyl rhodium NHC complexes with labile alkene ligands (ethene and cyclooctene) have been synthesized and shown to be better catalysts than the related fluorenyl&#8208;tethered NHC rhodium complexes for the C&#8722;H activation and borylation of arenes and alkanes.







Abstract
Indenyl (Ind) rhodium N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes [Rh(&#951;5&#8208;Ind)(NHC)(L)] were synthesised for 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;4,5&#8208;dihydroimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (SIPr) with L=C2H4 (1), CO (2&#8201;a) and cyclooctene (COE; 3), for 1,3&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)&#8208;4,5&#8208;dihydroimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (SIMes) with L=CO (2&#8201;b) and COE (4), and 1,3&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (IMes) with L=CO (2&#8201;c) and COE (5). Reaction of SIPr with [Rh(Cp*)(C2H4)2] did not give the desired SIPr complex, thus demonstrating the &#8220;indenyl effect&#8221; in the synthesis of 1. Oxidative addition of HSi(OEt)3 to 3 proceeded under mild conditions to give the Rh silyl hydride complex [Rh(Ind){Si(OEt)3}(H)(SIPr)] (6) with loss of COE. Tethered&#8208;fluorenyl NHC rhodium complexes [Rh{(&#951;5&#8208;C13H8)C2H4N(C)C2HxNR}(L)] (x=4, R=Dipp, L=C2H4: 11; L=COE: 12; L=CO: 13; R=Mes, L=COE: 14; L=CO: 15; x=2, R=Me, L=COE: 16; L=CO: 17) were synthesised in low yields (5&#8211;31&#8201;%) in comparison to good yields for the monodentate complexes (49&#8211;79&#8201;%). Compounds 3 and 1, which contain labile alkene ligands, were successful catalysts for the catalytic borylation of benzene with B2pin2 (Bpin=pinacolboronate, 97 and 93&#8201;% PhBpin respectively with 5&#8197;mol&#8201;% catalyst, 24&#8197;h, 80&#8201;&#176;C), with SIPr giving a more active catalyst than SIMes or IMes. Fluorenyl&#8208;tethered NHC complexes were much less active as borylation catalysts, and the carbonyl complexes were inactive. The borylation of toluene, biphenyl, anisole and diphenyl ether proceeded to give meta substitutions as the major product, with smaller amounts of para substitution and almost no ortho product. The borylation of octane and decane with B2pin2 at 120 and 140&#8201;&#176;C, respectively, was monitored by 11B NMR spectroscopy, which showed high conversions into octyl and decylBpin over 4&#8211;7&#8197;days, thus demonstrating catalysed sp3 C&#8722;H borylation with new piano stool rhodium indenyl complexes. Irradiation of the monodentate complexes with 400 or 420&#8197;nm light confirmed the ready dissociation of C2H4 and COE ligands, whereas CO complexes were inert. Evidence for C&#8722;H bond activation in the alkyl groups of the NHC ligands was obtained.

         <title>Strong Ligand Stabilization Based on &#960;&#8208;Extension in a Series of Ruthenium Terpyridine Water Oxidation Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water oxidation catalysis on a series of ruthenium(II) terpyridine complexes shows a correlation between catalytic performance and the extension of their &#960; bidentate ligand. Substitution of the Cl&#8722; ligand by H2O reveals increased stability of the Ru&#8722;Cl bond upon increasing the &#960;&#8208;system.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Water oxidation catalysis&lt;/b&gt; on a series of ruthenium(II) terpyridine complexes shows a correlation between catalytic performance and the extension of their &#960; bidentate ligand.

         <title>Reactivity of the Bicyclic Amido&#8208;Substituted Silicon (I) Ring Compound Si4{N(SiMe3)Mes}4 with FLP&#8208;Type Character</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unsaturated bicyclo[1.1.0]tetrasilatetraamide Si4{N(Mes)SiMe3}4 shown in the upper right corner has two threefold&#8208;coordinated silicon atoms that show zwitterionic character. This gives the molecule intramolecular FLP&#8208;type character. Different acids such as AlBr3, BH3, H+ and the base NHCMe4 can simply coordinate to the threefold&#8208;coordinated silicon atoms. These reagents &#8220;click&#8221; in place just like magnetic sticks and steel balls from a molecular construction kit do. More information can be found in the Full Paper by F. Lips et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103101).

         <title>Total Synthesis of Pulvomycin D</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A synthetic route to the pulvomycin class of natural products is presented, which culminated in the first synthesis of a pulvomycin, pulvomycin D. Key elements of the strategy include a pivotal aldol reaction which led to bond formation between the C24&#8208;C40 and the C8&#8208;C23 fragment. The remaining C1&#8208;C7 fragment was attached by a Yamaguchi esterification completing the assembly of the 40 carbon atoms within the main skeleton. Ring closure to the 22&#8208;membered lactone ring was achieved in the final stages of the synthesis by a Heck reaction. The completion of the synthesis required the removal of six silyl protecting groups in combination with olefin formation at C26&#8208;C27 by a Peterson elimination.</dc:description>

         <title>Crown Ether Host&#8208;Guest Molecular Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, molecular ferroelectrics have received great attention due to their lightweight, mechanical flexibility, easy preparation and excellent ferroelectric properties. Among them, crown ether&#8208;based molecular ferroelectrics, which are typically composed of the host crown ethers, the guest cations anchored in the crown ethers, and the counterions, are of great interest because of the host&#8208;guest structure. Such a structure allows the components to occur order&#8208;disorder transition easily, which is beneficial for inducing ferroelectric phase transition. Herein, we summarized the research progress of crown ether host&#8208;guest molecular ferroelectrics, focusing on their crystal structure, phase transition, ferroelectric&#8208;related properties. In view of the small spontaneous polarization and uniaxial nature, we outlook the chemical design strategies for obtaining high&#8208;performance crown ether&#8208;based molecular ferroelectrics. This minireview will be of guiding significance for the future exploration of crown ether host&#8208;guest molecular ferroelectrics.</dc:description>

         <title>Steric Repulsion Induced Conformational Switch in Supramolecular Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by the rigidified architecture of &#8216;picket&#8208;fence&#8217; systems, we propose a strategy utilizing strain in already peripherally overcrowded structures to impose intramolecular tension for selective atropisomeric conversion. Employing this approach, tunable shape&#8208;persistent porphyrin conformations were acquired exhibiting distinctive supramolecular nanostructures based on the orientation of the peripheral groups. The developed molecular strain engineering methodologies have allowed the introduction of the pivalic units creating a highly strained molecular skeleton. Changes in absorption spectrum indicated the presence of severe steric repulsions which were confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. To release the steric strain introduced by the peripheral units, thermal equilibration strategies were used to selectively convert the most abundant atropisomer to the desirable minor one.</dc:description>

         <title>Tris(tetramethylguanidinyl)phosphine: The simplest non&#8208;ionic phosphorus superbase and strongly&#8208;donating phosphine ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis and properties of the much sought&#8208;after tris(1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethylguanidinyl) phosphine P(tmg)  3  , a crystalline, superbasic phosphine accessible through a short and scalable procedure from the cheap and commercially available bulk chemicals 1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethylguanidine, tris(dimethylamino)phosphine and phosphorus trichloride. The new phosphine exhibits exceptional electron donor properties and readily forms transition metal complexes with gold(I), palladium(II) and rhodium(I) precursors. The formation of zwitterionic Lewis base adducts with carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide was explored. In addition, the complete series of phosphine chalcogenides was prepared from the reaction of P(tmg)  3  with N  2  O and the elemental chalcogens.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This report describes the synthesis of a [2.2]paracyclophane&#8208;derived annulated 3&#8208;amino&#8208;imidazole ligand library  via  a Groebke&#8211;Blackburn&#8211;Bienaym&#233; three&#8208;component reaction (GBB&#8208;3CR) employing formyl&#8208;cyclophanes in combination with diverse aliphatic and aromatic isocyanides and heteroaromatic amidines. The GBB&#8208;3CR gives access to differently functionalized skeletally&#8208;diverse cyclophanyl imidazole ligands, namely 3&#8208;amino&#8208;imidazo[1,2&#8208;  a  ]pyridines and imidazo[1,2&#8208;  a  ]pyrazines. Additionally, a one&#8208;pot protocol for the GBB&#8208;3CR by an  in&#8208;situ  generation of cyclophanyl isocyanide is demonstrated. The product formation was analyzed by detailed spectroscopic techniques, and a cyclophanyl imidazo[1,2&#8208;  a  ]pyridine was confirmed unambiguously by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;Ray crystallography.

The GBB-3CR gives access to differently functionalized skeletally-diverse cyclophanyl imidazole ligands, namely 3-amino-imidazo[1,2-  a  ]pyridines and imidazo[1,2-  a  ]pyrazines. Additionally, a one-pot protocol for the GBB-3CR by an  in-situ  generation of cyclophanyl isocyanide is demonstrated. The product formation was analyzed by detailed spectroscopic techniques, and a cyclophanyl imidazo[1,2-  a  ]pyridine was confirmed unambiguously by single-crystal X-Ray crystallography. The cyclophanyl imidazole ligands can be readily transformed to showcase their useful utility in preparing  N  ,  C  -palladacycles  via  regioselective  ortho  -palladation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Non&#8208;heme&#8208;iron&#8208;mediated selective halogenation of unactivated carbon&#8208;hydrogen bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidation of the iron(II) precursor [(L  1  )Fe  II  Cl  2  ] with soluble iodosylbenzene  s  PhIO, where L  1  is a tetradentate bispidine, leads to the extremely reactive ferryl oxidant [(L  1  )(Cl)Fe  IV  =O]  +  with a  cis  disposition of the chlorido and oxido coligands as observed in nonheme halogenase enzymes. Experimental data indicate that, with cyclohexane as substrate, there is selective formation of chlorocyclohexane, where the halogenation is initiated by C&#8208;H abstraction and the result of a rebound of the ensuing radical to an iron&#8208;bound Cl  &#8208;  . The time&#8208;resolved formation of the halogenation product indicates that this primarily results from  s  PhIO oxidation of an initially formed oxido&#8208;bridged diiron(III) resting state. The high yield of up to over 70% (stoichiometric reaction) as well as the differing reactivities of free Fe  2+  and Fe  3+  in comparison with [(L  1  )Fe  II  Cl  2  ] indicate a high complex stability of the bispidine&#8208;iron complexes. A DFT analysis shows that, due to a large driving force and small triplet&#8208;quintet gap, in comparison to other small molecule halogenase models [(L  1  )(Cl)Fe  IV  =O]  +  is the most reactive, that the Fe  III  / radical rebound intermediate has a relatively long lifetime, supported by experimentally observed cage escape, and that this intermediate has, as observed experimentally, a lower energy barrier to the halogenation than the hydroxylation product, and this is shown to primarily be due to steric effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Amination of Drug&#8208;Like Benzoic Acids: Access to Anilines and Drug Conjugates through Directed Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Added at the eleventh hour: A method for the late&#8208;stage directed amination of benzoic acids is presented. It allows rapid access to both small amino&#8208;functionalized analogues and large conjugates, including PROTACs, peptide conjugates and probes for chemical biology. Selection of the right catalyst and reagent enabled the use of high&#8208;throughput experimentation and automation.







Abstract
The functionalization of C&#8722;H bonds, ubiquitous in drugs and drug&#8208;like molecules, represents an important synthetic strategy with the potential to streamline the drug&#8208;discovery process. Late&#8208;stage aromatic C&#8722;N bond&#8211;forming reactions are highly desirable, but despite their significance, accessing aminated analogues through direct and selective amination of C&#8722;H bonds remains a challenging goal. The method presented herein enables the amination of a wide array of benzoic acids with high selectivity. The robustness of the system is manifested by the large number of functional groups tolerated, which allowed the amination of a diverse array of marketed drugs and drug&#8208;like molecules. Furthermore, the introduction of a synthetic handle enabled expeditious access to targeted drug&#8208;delivery conjugates, PROTACs, and probes for chemical biology. This rapid access to valuable analogues, combined with operational simplicity and applicability to high&#8208;throughput experimentation has the potential to aid and considerably accelerate drug discovery.

         <title>Development of an Enzyme&#8208;Inhibitor Reaction Using Cellular Retinoic Acid Binding Protein II for One&#8208;Pot Megamolecule Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic retinoid covalent inhibitor that targets the nucleophilic tyrosine residue in cellular retinoic acid binding protein II (CRABP2) in mild conditions was developed. This enzyme&#8208;inhibitor pair was integrated into the megamolecule assembly strategy to construct protein scaffolds in one&#8208;pot reactions. Here, three orthogonal enzyme&#8208;inhibitor reactions occurred simultaneously to form a homogeneous product without the use of protecting groups.







Abstract
This paper presents an enzyme building block for the assembly of megamolecules. The system is based on the inhibition of the human&#8208;derived cellular retinoic acid binding protein II (CRABP2) domain. We synthesized a synthetic retinoid bearing an arylfluorosulfate group, which uses sulfur fluoride exchange click chemistry to covalently inhibit CRABP2. We conjugated both the inhibitor and a fluorescein tag to an oligo(ethylene glycol) backbone and measured a second&#8208;order rate constant for the protein inhibition reaction of approximately 3,600&#8197;M&#8722;1s&#8722;1. We used this new enzyme&#8208;inhibitor pair to assemble multi&#8208;protein structures in one&#8208;pot reactions using three orthogonal assembly chemistries to demonstrate exact control over the placement of protein domains within a single, homogeneous molecule. This work enables a new dimension of control over specificity, orientation, and stoichiometry of protein domains within atomically precise nanostructures.

         <title>Synthesis of Extra&#8208;Large Pore, Large Pore and Medium Pore Zeolites Using a Small Imidazolium Cation as the Organic Structure&#8208;Directing Agent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using a small&#8208;sized imidazolium cation of facile synthesis as the organic structure&#8208;directing agent, three germanosilicate zeolites with extra&#8208;large, large and medium pores were synthesized. For the recently reported extra&#8208;large pore zeolite &#8208;SYT, the location of the organic cations was studied by molecular simulations, confirmed by Rietveld refinement and compared to that reported for the original, sophisticated and expensive &#8208;SYT cation.







Abstract
One common strategy in the search for new zeolites is the use of organic structure&#8208;directing agents (OSDA). Typically, one seeks to achieve a high specificity in the structure&#8208;directing effect of the OSDA. This study shows, however, that an OSDA lacking strong specificity towards any particular zeolite may provide opportunities for discovery when other synthesis parameters are systematically screened. Thus, 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;n&#8208;propylimidazolium has allowed to crystallize the new large/medium pore zeolite HPM&#8208;16 as well as the recently reported extra&#8208;large pore &#8208;SYT and the medium/small pore and chiral STW. The sophisticated OSDA originally affording &#8208;SYT and the new simple OSDA have very little in common, both in terms of size, shape and flexibility, while both may still direct the synthesis of the same zeolite. In fact, molecular simulations show that the new OSDA is located in three different positions of the &#8208;SYT structure, including the discrete 8MR where the original organic could not fit.

         <title>Modification of Amorphous Mesoporous Zirconia Nanoparticles with Bisphosphonic Acids: A Straightforward Approach for Tailoring the Surface Properties of the Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bisphosphonic acids provide a straightforward method for the covalent modification of the surface of mesoporous zirconia nanoparticles, with stronger affinity with respect to monophosphonate compounds. The modular synthesis of the bisphosphonic acids based on thio&#8208;Michael addition reaction on tetraethyl vinylidenebisphosphonate ester enables the preparation of zirconia nanoparticles with specific functional groups or charges on the surface.







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;Bisphosphonic acids provide a straightforward method for the covalent modification of the surface of mesoporous zirconia nanoparticles, with stronger affinity with respect to monophosphonate compounds. The modular synthesis of the bisphosphonic acids based on thio-Michael addition reaction on tetraethyl vinylidenebisphosphonate ester enables the preparation of zirconia nanoparticles with specific functional groups or charges on the surface.

         <title>Afterglow Implant for Arterial Embolization and Intraoperative Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) is wildly used in clinical treatments. However, the online monitoring of the thrombosis formation is limited due to the challenges of the direct visualization of embolic agents and the real&#8208;time monitoring of dynamic blood flow. Thus, we developed a photochemical afterglow implant with strong afterglow intensity and a long lifetime for embolization and imaging. The liquid pre&#8208;implant injected into the abdominal aorta of mice was rapidly transformed into a hydrogel  in situ  to embolize the blood vessel. The vascular embolism position can be observed by the enhanced afterglow of the fixed implant, and the long lifetime of afterglow can also be used to monitor the effect of embolization. This provides an excellent candidate in bio&#8208;imaging to avoid the autofluorescence interference from continuous light excitation. The study suggests the potential usefulness of the implant as an embolic agent in TAE and artery imaging during a surgical procedure.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering the role of anions and secondary coordination sphere in tuning anisotropy in Dy(III) air&#8208;stable D5h SIMs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise control of the crystal field and symmetry around the paramagnetic spin centre has recently facilitated the engineering of high&#8208;temperature single&#8208;ion magnets (SIMs), the smallest possible units for future spin&#8208;based devices. In the present work, we report a series of air&#8208;stable seven coordinate Dy(III) SIMs {[L  2  Dy(H  2  O)  5  ][X]  3  &#183;L  2  &#183;  n  (H  2  O),  n  = 0, X = Cl (  1  ),  n  = 1, X = Br (  2  ), I (  3  )} possessing pseudo&#8208;  D  5h  symmetry&#160;with high energy barrier (  U  eff  ) and blocking temperature (  T  B  ). While the strong axial coordination from&#160;  t  BuPO(NH  i  Pr)  2  (  L  ), increases the overall anisotropy of the system, the presence of high symmetry significantly quenches quantum tunnelling of magnetization. The energy barrier (  U  eff  ) and the blocking temperature (  T  B  ) decrease in the order  3  &gt;  2  &gt;  1  with the change of anions from larger iodide to smaller strongly hydrogen&#8208;bonded chloride in the secondary coordination sphere, albeit the local coordination geometry and the symmetry around the Dy(III) display only slight deviations.  Ab initio  CASSCF/RASSI&#8208;SO/SINGLE_ANISO calculations further provide deeper insights into the dynamics of magnetic relaxation in addition to the role of the secondary coordination sphere in modulating the anisotropy of the  D  5h  systems, using diverse models. Thus, in addition to the importance of the crystal field and the symmetry to obtain high&#8208;temperature SIMs, this study also probes the significance of the secondary coordination sphere that can be tailored to accomplish novel SIMs.</dc:description>

         <title>Platinum&#8208;tin/tin oxide/CNT catalysts for high&#8208;performance electrocatalytic ethanol oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ethanol is a promising liquid clean energy source in the energy conversion field. However, the self&#8208;poisoning caused by the strongly adsorbed reaction intermediates (typically, CO) is a critical problem in ethanol oxidation reaction. To address this issue, we proposed a joint use of two strategies, alloying of Pt with other metals and building Pt/metal&#8208;oxide interfaces, to achieve high&#8208;performance electrocatalytic ethanol oxidation. For this, a well&#8208;designed synthetic route combining wet impregnation with a two&#8208;step thermal treatment process was established to construct PtSn/SnO  x  interfaces on carbon nanotubes. Using this route, the alloying of Pt&#8208;Sn and formation of PtSn&#8208;SnO  x  interfaces can simultaneously be achieved, and the coverage of SnO  x  thin films on PtSn alloy nanoparticles can be facilely tuned by the strong interaction between Pt and SnO  x  . The results revealed that the partial coverage of SnO  x  species not only retained the active sites, but also enhanced the CO anti&#8208;poisoning ability of the catalyst. Consequently, the H&#8208;PtSn/SnO  x  /CNT&#8208;2 catalyst with an optimized PtSn&#8208;SnO  x  interface showed significantly improved performances toward the ethanol oxidation reaction (825 mA mg  Pt  &#8722;1  ). This study provides deep insights into the structure&#8208;performance relationship of PtSn/metal oxide composite catalysts, which would be helpful for the future design and fabrication of high&#8208;performance Pt&#8208;based ethanol oxidation reaction catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobaloxime Complex Salts: Synthesis, Patterning on Carbon Nanomembranes and Heterogeneous Hydrogen Evolution Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the synthesis of a new cobaloxime&#8208;based double complex salt and its use as a catalyst for the homogeneous and heterogeneous, light&#8208;driven hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).

Cobaloximes are promising, earth&#8208;abundant catalysts for the light&#8208;driven hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Typically, these cobalt(III) complexes are prepared in&#8197;situ or employed in their neutral form, for example, [Co(dmgH)2(py)Cl], even though related complex salts have been reported previously and could, in principle, offer improved catalytic activity as well as more efficient immobilization on solid support. Herein, we report an interdisciplinary investigation into complex salts [Co(dmgH)2(py)2]+[Co(dmgBPh2)2Cl2]&#8722;, 
 and [Co(dmgH)2(py)2]+BArF&#8722;. We describe their strategic syntheses from the commercially available complex [Co(dmgH)2(py)Cl] and demonstrate that these double and single complex salts are potent catalysts for the light&#8208;driven HER. We also show that scanning electrochemical cell microscopy can be used to deposit arrays of catalysts [Co(dmgH)2(py)2]+[Co(dmgBPh2)2Cl2]&#8722;, 
 and [Co(dmgH)2(py)Cl] on supported and free&#8208;standing amino&#8208;terminated &#8764;1&#8208;nm&#8208;thick carbon nanomembranes (CNMs). Photocatalytic H2 evolution at such arrays was quantified with Pd microsensors by scanning electrochemical microscopy, thus providing a new approach for catalytic evaluation and opening up novel routes for the creation and analysis of &#8220;designer catalyst arrays&#8221;, nanoprinted in a desired pattern on a solid support.

&lt;p&gt;We report the synthesis of a new cobaloxime-based double complex salt and its use as a catalyst for the homogeneous and heterogeneous, light-driven hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). We successfully deposited these catalysts by scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) on supported and free-standing 2D amino-terminated carbon nanomembranes (CNMs) and quantified hydrogen by using Pd microsensors.

&lt;p&gt;Cobaloximes are promising, earth-abundant catalysts for the light-driven hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis and properties of indeno[1,2,3,4&#8208; pqra ]perylene, which was prepared by the fusion of one anthracene unit with one naphthalene unit via three carbon&#8211;carbon bonds. The synthetic route through two&#8208;fold C&#8211;H arylation enabled not only the synthesis of unsubstituted indenoperylene, but also rapid access to its arylated derivatives on the gram scale. Indenoperylene is a medium&#8208;sized aromatic hydrocarbon with the composition C 24 H 12 that is isomeric to coronene. Nevertheless, its absorption covers the entire visible region owing to its small HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap. Furthermore, indenoperylene exhibits high stability despite the absence of peripheral substituents. We propose that the unique electronic structure of indenoperylene originates from the coexistence of an electron&#8208;withdrawing subunit (benzoaceanthrylene) and an electron&#8208;donating subunit (perylene). The electronic properties of indenoperylene were modulated via post&#8208;functionalization through regioselective bromination. The current research demonstrates that indenoperylene is a promising candidate as a main skeleton for near&#8208;infrared&#8208;responsive and redox&#8208;active materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Maytansinol is avaluable precursor fro the preparation of maytansine derivatives (known as maytansinoids). Inspired by its intriguing structure and their success in targeted cancer therapy, we explored the maytansinol acylation reaction.

We characterized these molecules by docking studies, by a comprehensive biochemical evaluation and by determination of their crystal structures in complex with tubulin.

         <title>Spin&#8208;spin Coupling Controls the Gas&#8208;phase Reactivity of Aromatic &#963;&#8208;Type Triradicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Examination of the reactions of &#963;&#8208;type quinolinium&#8208;based triradicals with cyclohexane in the gas phase demonstrated that  the radical site that is the least strongly coupled to the other two radical sites reacts first, independent of the intrinsic reactivity of this radical site,  in contrast to related biradicals that first react at the most  electron&#8208;deficient  radical site. Abstraction of one or two H atoms and formation of an ion that formally corresponds to a combination of the ion and cyclohexane accompanied by elimination of a H atom (&#8220;addition &#8211; H&#8221;) were observed. In all cases except one, the most reactive radical site of the triradicals is  intrinsically less reactive  than the other two radical sites. The product complex of the H abstraction either dissociates to give the H atom abstraction product and the cyclohexyl radical or the more reactive radical site in the produced biradical abstracts a H atom from the cyclohexyl radical. The monoradical product can add&#160;to cyclohexene followed by elimination of a H atom, generating the &#8220;addition &#8211; H&#8221; products. Similar reaction efficiencies were measured for three of the triradicals as for relevant monoradicals. Surprisingly, the remaining three triradicals (all with&#160;a  meta  &#8208;pyridyne moiety)  reacted substantially faster than the relevant monoradicals  . This is rationalized based on the exothermic generation of the same  meta  &#8208;pyridyne analog for these three triradicals has enough energy to attain  the dehydrocarbon atom separation common for H atom abstraction transition states  of protonated  meta  &#8208;pyridynes.</dc:description>

         <title>Properties of Single&#8208;Component Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Crystal&#8208;Glass Composites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation, and subsequent structural, thermal and adsorptive properties of single&#8208;component metal&#8211;organic framework crystal&#8208;glass composites (MOF&#8208;CGCs) are investigated. A series of novel materials exhibiting chemically identical glassy and crystalline phases within the same material were produced, where crystalline ZIF&#8208;62(Zn) was incorporated within an  agZIF&#8208;62(Zn) matrix.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The formation, and subsequent structural, thermal and adsorptive properties of single-component metal&#8211;organic framework crystal-glass composites (MOF-CGCs) are investigated. A series of novel materials exhibiting chemically identical glassy and crystalline phases within the same material were produced, where crystalline ZIF-62(Zn) was incorporated within an  agZIF-62(Zn) matrix. X-ray diffraction showed that the crystalline phase was still present after heating to above the glass transition temperature of  agZIF-62(Zn), and interfacial compatibility between the crystalline and glassy phases was investigated using a mixed-metal (ZIF-62(Co))0.5(agZIF-62(Zn))0.5 analogue.

         <title>Electroreductive Cross&#8208;Coupling of Trifluoromethyl Alkenes and Redox Active Esters for the Synthesis of Gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electroreductive decarboxylative/defluorinative cross&#8208;coupling between redox&#8208;active esters and &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl styrenes enabled the access to a wide range of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes. The transformation can be conducted efficiently under simple metal&#8208;free reaction conditions and features a broad scope with high yields.







Abstract
An electroreductive access to gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes has been developed through the decarboxylative/defluorinative coupling of N&#8208;hydroxyphtalimides esters and &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl alkenes. The electrolysis is performed under very simple reaction conditions in an undivided cell using cheap carbon graphite electrodes. This metal&#8208;free transformation features broad scope with good to excellent yields. Tertiary, secondary as well as primary alkyl radicals could be easily introduced. &#945;&#8208;aminoacids L&#8208;aspartic and L&#8208;glutamic acid&#8208;derived redox active esters were good reactive partners furnishing potentially relevant gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes. In addition, it has been demonstrated that our electrosynthetic approach toward the synthesis of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes could use an easily prepared Kratitsky salt as alkyl radical precursor via a deaminative/defluorinative carbofunctionalization of trifluoromethylstyrene.

         <title>Case Study of N&#8208;iPr versus N&#8208;Mes Substituted NHC Ligands in Nickel Chemistry: The Coordination and Cyclotrimerization of Alkynes at [Ni(NHC)2]</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large versus small: The impact of two different NHC ligands in complexes [Ni(NHC)2] and the behavior of the complexes towards alkynes is presented. It demonstrates how small differences in the stereo&#8208;electronic features of closely related ligands can significantly alter the reactivity pattern. The reaction of (suitable precursors of) both complexes with alkynes gave &#951;2&#8208;(C,C)&#8208;alkyne complexes [Ni(NHC)2](&#951;2&#8208;alkyne)], although the number of complexes available for [Ni(Mes2Im)2] is limited to small alkynes and good acceptor alkynes.







Abstract
A case study on the effect of the employment of two different NHC ligands in complexes [Ni(NHC)2] (NHC=iPr2ImMe 1Me, Mes2Im 2) and their behavior towards alkynes is reported. The reaction of a mixture of [Ni2(iPr2ImMe)4(&#956;&#8208;(&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2)&#8208;COD)] B/ [Ni(iPr2ImMe)2(&#951;4&#8208;COD)] B&#8217; or [Ni(Mes2Im)2] 2, respectively, with alkynes afforded complexes [Ni(NHC)2(&#951;2&#8208;alkyne)] (NHC=iPr2ImMe: alkyne=MeC&#8801;CMe 3, H7C3C&#8801;CC3H7 4, PhC&#8801;CPh 5, MeOOCC&#8801;CCOOMe 6, Me3SiC&#8801;CSiMe3 7, PhC&#8801;CMe 8, HC&#8801;CC3H7 9, HC&#8801;CPh 10, HC&#8801;C(p&#8208;Tol) 11, HC&#8801;C(4&#8208;tBu&#8208;C6H4) 12, HC&#8801;CCOOMe 13; NHC=Mes2Im: alkyne=MeC&#8801;CMe 14, MeOOCC&#8801;CCOOMe 15, PhC&#8801;CMe 16, HC&#8801;C(4&#8208;tBu&#8208;C6H4) 17, HC&#8801;CCOOMe 18). Unusual rearrangement products 11&#8201;a and 12&#8201;a were identified for the complexes of the terminal alkynes HC&#8801;C(p&#8208;Tol) and HC&#8801;C(4&#8208;tBu&#8208;C6H4), 11 and 12, which were formed by addition of a C&#8722;H bond of one of the NHC N&#8208;iPr methyl groups to the C&#8801;C triple bond of the coordinated alkyne. Complex 2 catalyzes the cyclotrimerization of 2&#8208;butyne, 4&#8208;octyne, diphenylacetylene, dimethyl acetylendicarboxylate, 1&#8208;pentyne, phenylacetylene and methyl propiolate at ambient conditions, whereas 1Me is not a good catalyst. The reaction of 2 with 2&#8208;butyne was monitored in some detail, which led to a mechanistic proposal for the cyclotrimerization at [Ni(NHC)2]. DFT calculations reveal that the differences between 1Me and 2 for alkyne cyclotrimerization lie in the energy profile of the initiation steps, which is very shallow for 2, and each step is associated with only a moderate energy change. The higher stability of 3 compared to 14 is attributed to a better electron transfer from the NHC to the metal to the alkyne ligand for the N&#8208;alkyl substituted NHC, to enhanced Ni&#8208;alkyne backbonding due to a smaller CNHC&#8722;Ni&#8722;CNHC bite angle, and to less steric repulsion of the smaller NHC iPr2ImMe.

         <title>MicroRNA&#8208;Triggered Nanozymes Cascade Reaction for Tumor&#8208;Specific Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microRNA&#8208;triggered nanozymes cascade platform was constructed for tumor&#8208;specific chemodynamic therapy. Glucose oxidase&#8208;like nanozyme and peroxidase&#8208;like nanozyme were brought into close proximity through hybridization with miRNA&#8208;21 in MCF&#8208;7 cancer cells, resulting in efficient production of hydroxyl radicals to kill cancer cells. The system presented enhanced catalytic activity and minimal off&#8208;target toxicity, and provided an effective strategy for tumor&#8208;specific chemodynamic therapy.







Abstract
Off&#8208;target toxicity and insufficient hydroxyl radicals (.OH) generation limit the further clinical application of nanozymes in chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Herein, we designed and constructed a microRNA&#8208;triggered nanozyme cascade platform for enhanced tumor&#8208;specific chemodynamic therapy. The nanozyme&#8208;based cascade reaction could be triggered successfully by the high expression of microRNA in cancer cells to generate more .OH, thus exhibiting excellent tumor&#8208;specific therapeutic performance. Our work provides a new dimension for tumor&#8208;specific chemodynamic therapy.

         <title>On the Reduction of MoO3 to MoO2: A Path to Control the Particle Size and Morphology</title>

         <dc:description>
Controlling the hydrogen reduction of molybdenum trioxide to molybdenum dioxide and eventually metallic molybdenum with desirable morphology is a topic of continual scientific interest. Herein, this work presents a method of forming a wide range of grain sizes of the crucial molybdenum dioxide intermediary product by the adjustment of parameters such as temperature, water content and potassium content, further elucidating this first reduction step.







Abstract
During the reduction of molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) to metallic molybdenum, the first reduction step yielding molybdenum dioxide as an intermediary product is of crucial importance. In this study, we examined the impact of the parameters reduction temperature, water influx, and potassium content on the hydrogen reduction of this first reaction step. Beginning from the same starting material, the chemical vapor transport mechanism was utilized to yield the phase pure MoO2. Analyses including powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, inductively coupled plasma&#8208;mass spectrometry, scanning electron microscopy, and high performance optical microscopy were performed on the product phases. Modulations of the specific surface areas of molybdenum dioxide ranging from 2.28 to 0.41&#8197;m2/g were possible. Furthermore, a distinct shift from small plate&#8208;like grains to cuboid&#8208;like forms was achieved.

         <title>Versatile Para&#8208;Substituted Pyridine Lanthanide Coordination Complexes Allow Late Stage Tailoring of Complex Function</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of cationic and neutral p&#8208;bromo and p&#8208;nitropyridine substituted Eu(III) and Gd(III) coordination complexes serve as versatile synthetic intermediates. This approach allows the late stage tuning of absorption and emission spectroscopic properties for Eu(III) complexes, and provides easy access to the corresponding Eu(II) analogues, aiding the development of Gd(III) EPR spin probes that can be readily conjugated to biomolecules, under mild conditions.







Abstract
A series of cationic and neutral p&#8722;Br and p&#8722;NO2 pyridine substituted Eu(III) and Gd(III) coordination complexes serve as versatile synthetic intermediates. Nucleophilic aromatic substitution occurs readily at the para position under mild conditions, allowing C&#8722;N and C&#8722;C bond forming reactions to take place, permitting the introduction of azide, amino and alkynyl substituents. For Eu(III) complexes, this approach allows late stage tuning of absorption and emission spectral properties, exemplified by the lowering of the energy of an LMCT transition accompanied by a reduction in the Eu&#8722;Npy bond length. Additionally, these complexes provide direct access to the corresponding Eu(II) analogues. With the Gd(III) series, the nature of the p&#8208;substituent does not significantly change the EPR properties (linewidth, relaxation times), as required for their development as EPR spin probes that can be readily conjugated to biomolecules under mild conditions.

         <dc:description>Several novel binaphthyl&#8208;based chiral hypervalent iodine(III) reagents have been prepared and structurally analyzed. Various asymmetric oxidative reactions were applied to evaluate the reactivities and stereoselectivities of those reagents. Moderate to excellent yields were observed, however, very low stereoselectivities were obtained. The NMR experiments indicate that these reagents are very easily hydrolyzed in either chloroform or DMSO solvents leading to limited stereoselectivities. It is concluded that the use of chiral ligands is an unsuccessful way to prepare efficient stereoselective iodine(III) reagents.</dc:description>

         <title>From Thioureas to Thioquinolines through Isolated Benzothiazines by Gold Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation of new benzothiazine heterocycles have been achieved starting from thiourea derivatives and using different gold catalysts. The catalyst and the conditions have been optimised towards the selective synthesis of 6&#8208;membered benzothiazine heterocycles, characterised by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Interestingly, these organic compounds evolved under gold catalysis in basic medium to achieve the formation of amino thioquinolines through an unprecedented aromatisation process of the heterocycle. The reaction has also been carried out stoichiometrically by reaction of gold complexes to afford the thioquinolines coordinated to the gold fragment. Benzothiazine, amino thioquinoline heterocycles and gold derived species have a great potential for biological applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Coordinatively Unsaturated Amidotitanocene Cations with Inverted &#963; and &#960; Bond Strengths: Controlled Release of Aminyl Radicals and Hydrogenation/Dehydrogenation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amidotitanocene cations serve as versatile, &#8220;bottlable&#8221; precursors for a range of highly reactive species such as aminyl radicals, and active catalysts for hydrogenation/dehydrogenation reactions. Their catalytic performance in amine&#8208;silane dehydrocoupling is the highest recorded so far for an earth&#8208;abundant metal (TON up to 3960). The Ti&#8722;N interaction displays reversed &#963; and &#960; bond strengths, as shown by EDA&#8208;NOCV calculations.







Abstract
Cationic amidotitanocene complexes [Cp2Ti(NPhAr)][B(C6F5)4] (Cp=&#951;5&#8208;C5H5; Ar=phenyl (1&#8201;a), p&#8208;tolyl (1&#8201;b), p&#8208;anisyl (1&#8201;c)) were isolated. The bonding situation was studied by DFT (Density Functional Theory) using EDA&#8208;NOCV (Energy Decomposition Analysis with Natural Orbitals for Chemical Valence). The polar Ti&#8722;N bond in 1&#8201;a&#8211;c features an unusual inversion of &#963; and &#960; bond strengths responsible for the balance between stability and reactivity in these coordinatively unsaturated species. In solution, 1&#8201;a&#8211;c undergo photolytic Ti&#8722;N cleavage to release Ti(III) species and aminyl radicals &#8901;NPhAr. Reaction of 1&#8201;b with H3BNHMe2 results in fast homolytic Ti&#8722;N cleavage to give [Cp2Ti(H3BNHMe2)][B(C6F5)4] (3). 1&#8201;a&#8211;c are highly active precatalysts in olefin hydrogenation and silanes/amines cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling, whilst 3 efficiently catalyzes amine&#8208;borane dehydrogenation. The mechanism of olefin hydrogenation was studied by DFT and the cooperative H2 activation key step was disclosed using the Activation Strain Model (ASM).

     alt="Coordinatively Unsaturated Amidotitanocene Cations with Inverted &#963; and &#960; Bond Strengths: Controlled Release of Aminyl Radicals and Hydrogenation/Dehydrogenation Catalysis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Amidotitanocene&lt;/b&gt; cations serve as versatile, &#8220;bottlable&#8221; precursors for a range of highly reactive species such as aminyl radicals, and active catalysts for hydrogenation/dehydrogenation reactions. Their catalytic performance in amine-silane dehydrocoupling is the highest recorded so far for an earth-abundant metal (TON up to 3960). The Ti&#8722;N interaction displays reversed &#963; and &#960; bond strengths, as shown by EDA-NOCV calculations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cationic amidotitanocene complexes [Cp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ti(NPhAr)][B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] (Cp=&#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;; Ar=phenyl (&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;), p-tolyl (&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;), p-anisyl (&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;c&lt;/b&gt;)) were isolated. The bonding situation was studied by DFT (Density Functional Theory) using EDA-NOCV (Energy Decomposition Analysis with Natural Orbitals for Chemical Valence). The polar Ti&#8722;N bond in &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&#8211;c&lt;/b&gt; features an unusual inversion of &#963; and &#960; bond strengths responsible for the balance between stability and reactivity in these coordinatively unsaturated species. In solution, &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&#8211;c&lt;/b&gt; undergo photolytic Ti&#8722;N cleavage to release Ti(III) species and aminyl radicals &lt;b&gt;&#8901;&lt;/b&gt;NPhAr. Reaction of &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt; with H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;BNHMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; results in fast homolytic Ti&#8722;N cleavage to give [Cp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ti(H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;BNHMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)][B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;). &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&#8211;c&lt;/b&gt; are highly active precatalysts in olefin hydrogenation and silanes/amines cross-dehydrogenative coupling, whilst &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; efficiently catalyzes amine-borane dehydrogenation. The mechanism of olefin hydrogenation was studied by DFT and the cooperative H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation key step was disclosed using the Activation Strain Model (ASM).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fe&#8208;ZIF8 Coating Cu Foil Derived Carbon as A pH&#8208;universal Electrocatalyst for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is a great challenge to fabricate highly efficient pH&#8208;universal electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, a facile strategy, which includes coating the Fe modified ZIF8 on Cu foil and in&#8208;situ pyrolysis to evaporate and dope Cu into the MOF derived carbon, is developed to fabricate Fe/Cu&#8208;N co&#8208;doped carbon material (Cu/Fe&#8208;NC). Profiting from the modulated electron distribution and textual properties, well&#8208;designed Cu/Fe&#8208;NC exhibits superior half&#8208;wave potential (E  1/2  ) of 0.923 V in alkaline, 0.757 V in neutral and comparable 0.801 V in acid electrolytes, respectively. Furthermore, the ultralow peroxides yield of ORR demonstrates the high selectivity of Cu/Fe&#8208;NC in full pH scale electrolytes. As expected, the self&#8208;made alkaline and neutral zinc&#8208;air batteries equipped with Cu/Fe&#8208;NC cathode display excellent discharge voltages, outstanding peak power densities and remarkable stability. This work opens a new way to fabricate highly efficient and pH&#8208;universal electrocatalysts for ORR through strategy of Fe/Cu&#8208;N co&#8208;doping, Cu foil evaporation and carbon defects capture.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We successfully isolated and characterized the zinc carbamate complex (phen)Zn(OAc)(OC(=O)NHPh) (  1  , phen = 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline), formed as an intermediate during the Zn(OAc)  2  /phen&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of organic carbamates from CO  2  , amines, and the reusable reactant Si(OMe)  4  . Density functional theory calculations revealed that the direct reaction of  1  with Si(OMe)  4  proceeds via a 5&#8208;coordinate silicon intermediate, forming organic carbamates. Based on these results, the catalytic system was improved by using Si(OMe)  4  as the reaction solvent and additives like KOMe and KF, which promote the formation of the 5&#8208;coordinated silicon species. This sustainable and effective method can be used to synthesize various  N  &#8208;aryl and  N  &#8208;alkyl carbamates, including industrially important polyurethane raw materials, starting from CO  2  under atmospheric pressure.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Cervical cancer, as a common malignant tumor of reproductive system, seriously threatens women's life and health. Traditional treatments, including surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, are difficult to cure cervical cancer. Fortunately, tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;activated catalytic therapy with high efficiency and reduced off&#8208;target toxicity has emerged as a novel treatment model. Herein, we designed &#8220;four&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; nanozyme and natural enzyme symbiotic system of Cu  2&#8208;x  Se&#8208;GOx for TME&#8208;triggered cascaded catalytic enhanced cancer treatment. In response to unique TME, the Cu  2&#8208;x  Se with catalase activity could effectively catalyze over&#8208;expressed H  2  O  2  in cancer cells into O  2  . Subsequently, the glucose oxidase (GOx) could deplete intracellular glucose under the assistance of O  2  , which not only achieves starvation therapy, but also regenerates H  2  O  2  to boost the generation of highly cytotoxic &#183;OH due to the peroxidase activity of Cu  2&#8208;x  Se. Moreover, although glutathione (GSH) as a free radical scavenger is overexpressed in tumor cells, the Cu  2&#8208;x  Se with glutathione oxidase activity could effectively consume GSH for enhanced ROS production. Thus, the &#8220;four&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; nanozyme@natural enzyme symbiotic system of Cu  2&#8208;x  Se&#8208;GOx could significantly induce ROS accumulation at the tumor regions, which provides a potential approach for the treatment of cervical cancer.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>High&#8208;valent tetraalkylcuprates(III) and &#8208;argentates(III) are key intermediates of copper and silver&#8208;mediated C&#8722;C coupling reactions.

The gas&#8208;phase fragmentation experiments confirmed the preferred formation of the [RCuMe]  &#8722;  anion upon collisional activation of the cuprate(III) species, consistent with a homo&#8208;coupling reaction, whereas the silver analogue primarily yielded [AgMe  2  ]  &#8722;  , consistent with a cross&#8208;coupling reaction. For both complexes, density functional theory calculations identified one mechanism for homo coupling and four different ones for cross coupling. Of these pathways, an unprecedented concerted  outer&#8208;sphere  cross coupling is of particular interest, because it can explain the formation of [AgMe  2  ]  &#8722;  from the argentate(III) species. Remarkably, the different C&#8722;C coupling propensities of the two [RM  III  Me  3  ]  &#8722;  complexes become only apparent when properly accounting for the multi&#8208;configurational character of the wave function for the key transition state of [RAgMe  3  ]  &#8722;  . Backed by the obtained detailed mechanistic insight for the gas&#8208;phase reactions, we propose that the previously observed cross&#8208;coupling reaction of the silver complex in solution proceeds via the  outer&#8208;sphere  mechanism.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A new class of large&#8208;but&#8208;flexible Pd&#8211;BIAN&#8211;NHC catalysts (BIAN = acenaphthoimidazolylidene, NHC = N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) has been rationally designed to enable the challenging Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination of coordinating heterocycles. This robust class of BIAN&#8211;NHC catalysts permits cross&#8208;coupling of a variety of heterocycles with aryl, alkyl and heteroarylamines under practical aerobic conditions, including historically challenging oxazoles and thiazoles as well as electron&#8208;deficient heterocycles containing multiple heteroatoms with BIAN&#8211;INon (N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;di(4&#8208;heptyl)phenyl)&#8208;7H&#8208;acenaphtho[1,2&#8208;d]imidazol&#8208;8&#8208;ylidene) as the most effective ligand. Studies on the ligand structure and electronic properties of the carbene center are reported. The study should facilitate the discovery of even more active catalyst systems based on the unique BIAN&#8211;NHC scaffold.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Electronegativity and the Bridging of Chemical Bonding Concepts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The orbital and the density, hand in hand: Three perspectives for conceptualizing chemical bonding are connected here within one framework: experimental quantum chemistry. A new definition for atoms inside molecules leads to quantification of atomic energy, partial charge, and in&#8208;situ electronegativity. Predictions follow, of pKa, of electronegativity inversions in polar bonds, and of hydrogen stabilization&#8208;driven electron&#8208;deficient bonding in diborane.







Abstract
One challenge in chemistry is the plethora of often disparate models for rationalizing the electronic structure of molecules. Chemical concepts abound, but their connections are often frail. This work describes a quantum&#8208;mechanical framework that enables a combination of ideas from three approaches common for the analysis of chemical bonds: energy decomposition analysis (EDA), quantum chemical topology, and molecular orbital (MO) theory. The glue to our theory is the electron energy density, interpretable as one part electrons and one part electronegativity. We present a three&#8208;dimensional analysis of the electron energy density and use it to redefine what constitutes an atom in a molecule. Definitions of atomic partial charge and electronegativity follow in a way that connects these concepts to the total energy of a molecule. The formation of polar bonds is predicted to cause inversion of electronegativity, and a new perspective of bonding in diborane and guanine&#8722;cytosine base&#8208;pairing is presented. The electronegativity of atoms inside molecules is shown to be predictive of pKa.

         <title>Fluorescent Benzothiadiazole Derivatives as Fluorescence Imaging Dyes: A Decade of New Generation Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Go bio! The use of fluorescent benzothiadiazole small molecules as bioimaging probes has been reviewed. After more than a decade since the first application in cell&#8208;imaging experiments, a huge evolution in their utilization has been noted. Still, there is much room for improvements, creative ideas, and advances in the use of these dyes.







Abstract
The current review describes advances in the use of fluorescent 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole (BTD) derivatives after nearly one decade since the first description of bioimaging experiments using this class of fluorogenic dyes. The review describes the use of BTD&#8208;containing fluorophores applied as, inter alia, bioprobes for imaging cell nuclei, mitochondria, lipid droplets, sensors, markers for proteins and related events, biological processes and activities, lysosomes, plasma membranes, multicellular models, and animals. A number of physicochemical and photophysical properties commonly observed for BTD fluorogenic structures are also described.

         <title>Intramolecular N&#8211;H&#8230;F Hydrogen Bonding Interaction in a Series of 4&#8208;Anilino&#8208;5&#8208;Fluoroquinazolines: Experimental and Theoretical Characterization of Electronic and Conformational Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present the 4&#8208;anilino&#8208;6,7&#8208;ethylenedioxy&#8208;5&#8208;fluoroquinazoline scaffold as a novel model system for the characterization of the weak NH  &#8230;  F hydrogen bonding (HB) interaction. In this scaffold, the aniline NH proton is forced into close proximity with the nearby fluorine (  d  H,F  ~2.0 &#197;, &#8736; ~138&#176;), and a through&#8208;space interaction is observed by NMR spectroscopy with couplings (  1h  J  NH,F  ) of 19 &#177; 1 Hz. We used a combination of experimental (NMR and X&#8208;ray crystallography) and theoretical methods (DFT calculations) for the characterization of this weak interaction. In particular, we investigated the effect of conformational rigidity and steric compression on coupling. We used this scaffold for the direct comparison of fluoride (F) with methoxy (OMe) as HB acceptors, and we probed the susceptibility of the NH  &#8230;  F interaction to changes in electron distribution and resonance by preparing a series of molecules with different electron&#8208;donating or &#8208;withdrawing groups in the positions para to the NH and F. Our results support the idea that fluorine can act as a weak HB acceptor, and the HB strength can be modulated via additive and linear electronic substituent effects.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Metabolic activation of the human carcinogen 1,3&#8208;butadiene (BD) by cytochrome 450 monooxygenases gives rise to a genotoxic diepoxide, 1,2,3,4&#8208;diepoxybutane (DEB). This reactive electrophile alkylates guanine bases in DNA to produce N7&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3,4&#8208;epoxy&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;dG (N7&#8208;HEB&#8208;dG) adducts. Because of the positive charge at the N7 position of the purine heterocycle, N7&#8208;HEB&#8208;dG adducts are inherently unstable and can undergo spontaneous depurination or base&#8208;catalyzed imidazole ring opening to give  N  6  &#8208;[2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;  erythro  &#8208;pentofuranosyl]&#8208;2,6&#8208;diamino&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4&#8208;oxo&#8208;5&#8208;  N  &#8208;1&#8208;(oxiran&#8208;2&#8208;yl)propan&#8208;1&#8208;ol&#8208;formamidopyrimidine (DEB&#8208;FAPy&#8208;dG) adducts. Here we report the first synthesis and structural characterization of DEB&#8208;FAPy&#8208;dG adducts. Authentic standards of DEB&#8208;FAPy&#8208;dG and its  15  N  3  &#8208;labeled analogue were used for the development of a quantitative nanoLC&#8208;ESI  +  &#8208;HRMS/MS method, allowing for adduct detection in DEB&#8208;treated calf thymus DNA. DEB&#8208;FAPy&#8208;dG formation in DNA was dependent on DEB concentration and pH, with higher numbers observed under alkaline conditions.</dc:description>

Authentic standards of DEB-FAPy-dG and its  15  N  3  -labeled analogue were used for the development of a quantitative nanoLC-ESI  +  -HRMS/MS method, allowing for adduct detection in DEB-treated calf thymus DNA. DEB-FAPy-dG formation in DNA was dependent on DEB concentration and pH, with higher numbers observed under alkaline conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Developing efficient small molecule acceptors with sp2&#8208;hybridized nitrogen at different positions by density functional theory calculations, molecular dynamics simulations and machine learning</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical structure of small molecule acceptors determines their performance in organic solar cells. Multiscale simulations are necessary to avoid trial&#8208;and&#8208;error based design, ultimately to save time and resources. Herein, the effect of sp  2  &#8208;hybridized nitrogen substitution at the inner or the outmost position of central core, side chain, and terminal group of small molecule acceptors is investigated using multiscale computational modelling. Quantum chemical analysis is used to study the electronic behavior. Nitrogen substitution at end&#8208;capping has significantly decreased the electron&#8208;reorganization energy. No big change is observed in transfer integral and excited state behavior. However, nitrogen substitution at terminal group position is good way to improve electron&#8208;mobility. Power conversion efficiency (PCE) of newly designed acceptors is predicted using machine learning. Molecular dynamics simulations are also performed to explore the dynamics of acceptor and their blends with PBDB&#8208;T polymer donor. Florgy&#8208;Huggins parameter is calculated to study the mixing of designed small molecule acceptors with PBDB&#8208;T. Radial distribution function has indicated that PBDB&#8208;T has showed a closer packing with N3 and N4. From all analysis, it is found that nitrogen substitution at end&#8208;capping group is a better strategy to design efficient small molecule acceptors.</dc:description>

         <title>Joint Venture of Metal Cluster and Amphiphilic Cationic Minidendron Resulting in NIR Emissive Lamellar Ionic Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inorganic red&#8208;NIR emissive materials are particularly relevant in many fields like optoelectronic, bioimaging or solar cells. Benefiting from their emission in devices implies their integration in easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle materials like liquid crystals, whose long&#8208;range ordering and self&#8208;healing abilities could be exploited and influence emission. Herein, we present red&#8208;NIR emissive hybrid materials obtained with phosphorescent octahedral molybdenum cluster anions electrostatically associated with amphiphilic guanidinium minidendrons. Polarized optical microscopy and X&#8208;ray analysis show that while the minidendron chloride salts self&#8208;organize into columnar phases, their association with the dianionic metal cluster leads to layered phases. Steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved emission investigations demonstrate the influence of the minidendron alkyl chain length on the phosphorescence of the metal cluster core.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report a selective ortho,ortho&#8217;&#8208;functionalization of readily available aryl oxazolines by two successive magnesiations with sBu2Mg in toluene followed by trapping reactions with electrophiles such as (hetero)aryl iodides or bromides, iodine, tosyl cyanide, ethyl cyanoformate or allylic bromides (39 examples, 62&#8208;99% yield). Treatment of these aryl oxazolines with excess oxalyl chloride (50 &#176;C, 4 h) provided the corresponding nitriles (36 examples, 73&#8208;99% yield). Conversions of these nitriles to valuable heterocycles are reported and a tentative mechanism was proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Elucidating the Supramolecular Copolymerization of N&#8208; and C&#8208;Centered Benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;Tricarboxamides: The Role of Parallel and Antiparallel Packing of Amide Groups in the copolymer microstructure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An in&#8208;depth study of the supramolecular copolymerization behavior of N&#8208; and C&#8208;centered benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamides (N&#8208; and C&#8208;BTAs) is conducted in methylcyclohexane and in the solid state. The connectivity of the amide groups in the BTAs differs, and mixing N&#8208; and C&#8208;BTAs results in supramolecular copolymers with a blocky microstructure in solution. The blocky microstructure results from the formation of weaker and less organized, antiparallel hydrogen bonds between N&#8208; and C&#8208;BTAs. In methylcyclohexane, the helical threefold hydrogen&#8208;bonding network present in C&#8208; and N&#8208;BTAs is retained in the mixtures. In the solid state, in contrast, the hydrogen bonds of pure BTAs as well as their mixtures organize in a sheet&#8208;like pattern, and in the mixtures long&#8208;range order is lost. Drop&#8208;casting to kinetically trap the solution microstructures shows that C&#8208;BTAs retain the helical hydrogen bonds, but N&#8208;BTAs immediately adopt the sheet&#8208;like pattern, a direct consequence of the lower stabilization energy of the helical hydrogen bonds. In the copolymers, the stability of the helical aggregates depends on the copolymer composition, and helical aggregates are only preserved when a high amount of C&#8208;BTAs is present. The method outlined here is generally applicable to elucidate copolymerization behavior of supramolecular monomers both in solution as well as in the solid state.</dc:description>

         <title>Imidazolyl&#8208;phenylcarbazole&#8208;based Host Materials and Their Use for Co&#8208;host Designs in Phosphorescent OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, owing to the demand for high&#8208;efficiency phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting devices (PhOLEDs), many studies have been conducted on the development of bipolar host materials. A series of imidazolyl&#8208;phenylcarbazole&#8208;based host materials,  i.e.  ,  im&#8208;CzP  ,  im&#8208;CzPCz  ,  im&#8208;CzP  t  Bu  , and  im&#8208;OCzP  , were synthesized to obtain high&#8208;efficiency green and red&#8208;emitting PhOLEDs. With  im&#8208;OCzP  as the host, satisfactory peak efficiencies of 22.2 (77.0 cd A  &#8208;1  and 93.1 lm W  &#8208;1  ) and 14.1% (9.0 cd A  &#8208;1  and 10.1 lm W  &#8208;1  ) could be obtained, respectively. To further improve the performance of the devices, an electron transport material, bis&#8208;4,6&#8208;(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;3&#8208;pyridylphenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;methylpyrimidine (B3PyMPM) was selected to construct a co&#8208;hosted system. The efficiency of  im&#8208;OCzP  combined with B3PyMPM forming co&#8208;hosts could also achieve high values of 23.0 (80.0 cd A  &#8208;1  and 98.8 lm W  &#8208;1  ) and 16.5% (10.2 cd A  &#8208;1  and 13.4 lm W  &#8208;1  ) for green and red PhOLEDs, respectively. These results exhibited that the proposed bipolar hosts have great flexibility in adjusting the carrier balance of EML in OLEDs, demonstrating their ingenious design and high potential.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, owing to the demand for high-efficiency phosphorescent organic light-emitting devices (PhOLEDs), many studies have been conducted on the development of bipolar host materials. A series of imidazolyl-phenylcarbazole-based host materials,  i.e.  ,  im-CzP  ,  im-CzPCz  ,  im-CzP  t  Bu  , and  im-OCzP  , were synthesized to obtain high-efficiency green and red-emitting PhOLEDs. With  im-OCzP  as the host, satisfactory peak efficiencies of 22.2 (77.0 cd A  -1  and 93.1 lm W  -1  ) and 14.1% (9.0 cd A  -1  and 10.1 lm W  -1  ) could be obtained, respectively. To further improve the performance of the devices, an electron transport material, bis-4,6-(3,5-di-3-pyridylphenyl)-2-methylpyrimidine (B3PyMPM) was selected to construct a co-hosted system. The efficiency of  im-OCzP  combined with B3PyMPM forming co-hosts could also achieve high values of 23.0 (80.0 cd A  -1  and 98.8 lm W  -1  ) and 16.5% (10.2 cd A  -1  and 13.4 lm W  -1  ) for green and red PhOLEDs, respectively.

         <title>Synthesis, structures, and properties of helically fused anthraquinones with unusually close carbonyl&#8211;carbonyl contacts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electron&#8208;deficient aromatic ketones consisting of three fused anthraquinone units were synthesized by oxidation of the corresponding fused anthracenes. X&#8208;ray analysis revealed that these compounds had nonplanar helical structures with unusual contacts, C=O&#183;&#183;&#183;C=O 2.467 &#197;, between the inner carbonyl groups. The role of n&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960;* interactions in the short contacts was evaluated using a noncovalent interaction plot and natural bond orbital analysis. The dynamic process involving helical inversion was observed by the variable temperature  1  H NMR measurement of a derivative with 2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl groups, and the barrier was estimated to be 77 kJ mol  &#8211;1  . DFT calculations indicated that the helical inversion proceeded via a multistep mechanism. The characteristic spectroscopic and electrochemical data due to the electron&#8208;deficient anthraquinone units and the sterically congested carbonyl groups are discussed with the aid of DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing the Catalytic Activity of MOF&#8208;808 Towards Peptide Bond Hydrolysis through Synthetic Modulations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The performance of MOFs in catalysis is largely derived from structural features, and much work has focused on introducing structural changes such as defects or ligand functionalisation to boost the reactivity of the MOF. However, the effects of different parameters chosen for the synthesis on the catalytic reactivity of the resulting MOF remains poorly understood. Here, we evaluate the role of metal precursor on the reactivity of Zr&#8208;based MOF&#8208;808 towards the hydrolysis of the peptide bond in the glycylglycine model substrate. In addition, the effect of synthesis temperature and duration has been also investigated. Surprisingly, the metal precursor was found to have a large influence on the reactivity of the MOF, surpassing the effect of particle size or number of defects. Additionally, we show that by careful selection of the Zr&#8208;salt precursor and temperature used in MOF syntheses equally active MOF catalysts could be obtained after a 20 minute synthesis compared to 24 h synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Perfluoroaryl and perfluoroheteroaryl reagents as emerging new tools for peptide synthesis, modification and bioconjugation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptides and proteins are becoming increasingly valuable as medicines, diagnostic agents and as tools for biomedical sciences. Much of this has been underpinned by the emergence of new methods for the manipulation and augmentation of native biomolecules. Perfluoroaromatic reagents are perhaps one of the most diverse and exciting tools with which to modify peptides and proteins, due principally to their nucleophilic substitution chemistry, high electron deficiency and the ability for their reactivity to be tuned towards specific nucleophiles. As discussed in this minireview, in recent years, perfluoroaromatic reagents have found applications as protecting groups or activating groups in peptide synthesis and as orthogonal handles for peptide modification. Furthermore, they have applications in chemoselective &#8216;tagging&#8217;, stapling and bioconjugation of peptides and proteins, as well as tuning of &#8216;drug&#8208;like&#8217; properties. This review will also explore possible future applications of these reagents in biological chemistry.</dc:description>
