      <title>Electronic Finetuning of 8&#8208;Methoxy Psoralens by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling: Acidochromicity and Solvatochromicity</title>
      <dc:description>
A diverse and colorful library of novel psoralens can be obtained by cross&#8208;coupling reactions of 5&#8208;bromo&#8208;8&#8208;methoxypsoralen, which was prepared by a novel multistep synthesis. Photophysical properties, such as emission solvatochromicity and acidochromicity make this class of functional chromophores particularly attractive.







Abstract
Differently 5&#8208;substituted 8&#8208;methoxypsoralens can be synthesized by an efficient synthetic route with various cross&#8208;coupling methodologies, such as Suzuki, Sonogashira and Heck reaction. Compared to previously synthesized psoralens, thereby promising daylight absorbing compounds as potentially active agents against certain skin diseases can be readily accessed. Extensive investigations of all synthesized psoralen derivatives reveal fluorescence in the solid state as well as several distinctly emissive derivatives in solution. Donor&#8208;substituted psoralens exhibit remarkable photophysical properties, such as high fluorescence quantum yields and pronounced emission solvatochromicity and acidochromicity, which were scrutinized by Lippert&#8211;Mataga and Stern&#8211;Volmer plots. The results indicate that the compounds exceed the limit of visible light, a significant factor for potential applications as an active agent. In addition, (TD)DFT calculations were performed to elucidate the underlying electronic structure and to assign experimentally obtained data.

      <title>A Phosphinine&#8208;Derived 1&#8208;Phospha&#8208;7&#8208;Bora&#8208;Norbornadiene: Frustrated Lewis Pair Type Activation of Triple Bonds</title>
      <dc:description>
Just like an FLP: A hetero&#8208;norbornadiene incorporating phosphorus and boron atoms is accessible by a facile salt metathesis procedure. Although this compound represents a classical Lewis acid&#8211;base adduct, its reactivity is reminiscent of frustrated Lewis pairs. Reactions with nitriles and alkynes afford unusual insertion and 1,4&#8208;addition products. In both cases, reversible P&#8722;B bond dissociation is of key mechanistic significance.







Abstract
Salt metathesis of 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triphenylphosphacyclohexadienyl lithium and chlorobis(pentafluorophenyl)borane affords a 1&#8208;phospha&#8208;7&#8208;bora&#8208;norbornadiene derivative 2. The C&#8801;N triple bonds of nitriles insert into the P&#8722;B bond of 2 with concomitant C&#8722;B bond cleavage, whereas the C&#8801;C bonds of phenylacetylenes react with 2 to form &#955;4&#8208;phosphabarrelenes. Even though 2 must formally be regarded as a classical Lewis adduct, the C&#8801;N and C&#8801;C activation processes observed (and the mild conditions under which they occur) are reminiscent of the reactivity of frustrated Lewis pairs. Indeed, NMR and computational studies give insight into the mechanism of the reactions and reveal the labile nature of the phosphorus&#8211;boron bond in 2, which is also suggested by detailed NMR spectroscopic studies on this compound. Nitrile insertion is thus preceded by ring opening of the bicycle of 2 through P&#8722;B bond splitting with a low energy barrier. By contrast, the reaction with alkynes involves formation of a reactive zwitterionic methylphosphininium borate intermediate, which readily undergoes alkyne 1,4&#8208;addition.

      <title>Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced Heptacene Generation under Ambient Conditions: Utilization of Single&#8208;crystal Interior as an Isolated Reaction Site</title>
      <dc:description>The photo&#8208;induced generation of unstable molecules generally requires stringent conditions to prevent oxidation and the concomitant decomposition of the products. The visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced conversion of two heptacene precursors to heptacene was studied.

The photoirradiation of a&#160;  7&#8208;DK2  &#160;single crystal cleaved only one &#945;&#8208;diketone group, forming an intermediate bearing a pentacene subunit, while that of a&#160;  7&#8208;DK1  &#160;single crystal gave rise to characteristic absorption peaks of heptacene and their increase in intensity with photoirradiation time, indicating the generation of heptacene without decomposition. Heptacene production was not observed when the precursors were photoirradiated in solution, implying that the single crystal interior provided isolation from the external environment, thus preventing heptacene oxidation.</dc:description>

      <title>Unusual Structures of the Parent Molecules Diarsene, Distibene, and Dibismuthene. Toward Their Observation</title>
      <dc:description>There is considerable interest, from both experimental and theoretical perspectives, in molecules incorporating multiple bonds between main group elements. Herein, we not only consider the parent molecules HE=EH (E = As, Sb, Bi), but also a number of their isomers. For each E2 H2 molecule, a number of different structures were optimized with four different DFT methods. Final structures were determined with the coupled cluster method CCSD(T) using large basis sets, namely cc&#8208;pVQZ&#8208;PP, incorporating relativistic psuedopotentials. All feasible dissociation pathways are examined. For all three E2H2 molecules the trans isomer lies lowest in energy, with the cis isomer higher by 2.7 (As), 2.1 (Sb), and 1.8 (Bi) kcal/mol, respectively. However, both cis and trans structures should be observable, as large barriers (27.7, 20.5, and 17.7 kcal/mol) separate them. For both the cis and tran s structures, in the infrared the strong E&#8208;H stretching frequencies should also be observable. Only the cis structures have dipole moments (0.62, 0.01, and 0.83 debye, respectively), and their observation by microwave spectroscopy would be stunning. Also considered were the higher energy vinylidene&#8208;like, pyramidal, monobridged, and linear structures. We conclude that molecules such as HSb=SbH&#8208;Fe(CO)4, HBi=BiH&#8208;Fe(CO)4, and related systems, should be feasible synthetic targets.</dc:description>

Herein, by connecting one, two, or three electron&#8208;deficient zinc porphyrin units to an electron&#8208;rich triazatruxene core via ethynyl &#960;&#8208;bridges, conjugated multipolar molecules  TAT&#8208;(ZnP)  n  (n = 1&#8208;3) were developed as TPEF materials for cell imaging. The three new dyes present high fluorescence quantum yields (0.40&#8208;0.47) and rationally improved two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) properties. In particular, the peak TPA cross section of  TAT&#8208;ZnP  (436 GM) is significantly larger than that of the  ZnP  reference (59 GM). The  &#948;  TPA  values of  TAT&#8208;(ZnP)  2  and  TAT&#8208;(ZnP)  3  further increase to 1031 and up to 1496 GM respectively, indicating the effect of incorporated ZnP units on the TPA properties. The substantial improvement of the TPEF properties is attributed to the formation of &#960;&#8208;conjugated quadrapole/octupole molecules and the extension of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;D systems, which has been rationalized by density function theory (DFT) calculations. Moreover, all of the three new dyes display good biocompatibility and preferential targeting ability toward cytomembrane, thus can be superior candidates for TPEF imaging of living cells. Overall, this work demonstrated a promising strategy for the development of porphyrin&#8208;based TPEF materials by the construction and extension of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;D multipolar array.</dc:description>

      <title>Boronate Covalent and Hybrid Organic Frameworks Featuring P(III) and P=O Lewis Base Sites</title>
      <dc:description>Two covalent organic frameworks comprising Lewis basic P(III) centers and Lewis acidic boron atoms were prepared by poly&#8208;condensation reactions of newly obtained tris(4&#8208;diisopropoxyborylphenyl)phosphine with 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene and 2,3,6,7&#8208;tetrahydroxy&#8208;9,10&#8208;dimethylanthracene. Obtained materials exhibit significant sorption of dihydrogen (100 cm3g&#8208;1 at 1 bar at 77 K), methane (20 cm3g&#8208;1 at 1 bar at 273 K) and carbon dioxide (50 cm3g&#8208;1 at 1 bar at 273 K). They were exploited as solid&#8208;state ligands for coordination of Pd(0) centers.

      <title>Partially fluorinated copolymers as oxygen sensitive 19F MRI agents</title>
      <dc:description>19  F magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an promising emerging imaging modality. Specifically, the inherent sensitivity of the spin&#8208;lattice relaxation time (  T  1  ) of  19  F nuclei to oxygen partial pressure makes  19  F MRI an attractive non&#8208;invasive approach to quantify tissue oxygenation in a spatiotemporal manner. There remain, however, few materials with the adequate sensitivity to be used as oxygen&#8208;sensitive  19  F MRI agents. Herein, we report highly fluorinated monomers that provide a platform to realize water&#8208;soluble, partially fluorinated copolymers as  19  F MRI agents with the required sensitivity to quantify solution oxygenation at clinically relevant magnetic field strengths. The synthesis of a systematic library of partially fluorinated copolymers enabled a comprehensive evaluation of copolymer structure&#8211;property relationships relevant to  19  F MRI. The highest&#8208;performing material composition demonstrated a signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio that corresponded to an apparent  19  F density of 220 mM, which surpasses the threshold of 126 mM  19  F required for visualization on a three Tesla clinical MRI. Furthermore, the  T  1  of these high performing materials demonstrated a linear relationship with solution oxygenation, with oxygen sensitivity reaching 240&#215;10  &#8208;5  mmHg  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  . The relationships between material composition and  19  F MRI performance identified herein suggest general structure&#8211;property criteria for the further improvement of modular, water&#8208;soluble  19  F MRI agents for quantifying oxygenation in environments relevant to medical imaging .</dc:description>

      <title>FeIII and FeII Phosphasalen Complexes: Synthesis, Characterization, and Catalytic Application for 2&#8208;Naphtol Oxidative Coupling</title>
      <dc:description>We report on the synthesis and characterization of three iron(III) phosphasalen complexes,  [Fe  III  (Psalen)(X)]  differing in the nature of the counter&#8208;anion/exogenous ligand (X  &#8208;  = Cl  &#8208;  , NO  3  &#8208;  , OTf  &#8208;  ), as well as the neutral iron(II) analogue,  [Fe  II  (Psalen)]  . Phosphasalen (Psalen) differs from salen by the presence of iminophosphorane (P=N) functions in place of the imines. All the complexes were characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, UV&#8208;vis, EPR, and cyclic voltammetry. The [Fe  II  (Psalen)] complex was shown to remain tetracoordinated even in coordinating solvent but exhibits surprisingly a magnetic moment in line with a Fe  II  high spin ground state. For the Fe  III  complexes, the higher lability of triflate anion compared to nitrate was demonstrated. As they exhibit lower reduction potentials compared to their salen analogues, these complexes were tested for the coupling of 2&#8208;naphtol using O  2  from air as oxidant. In order to shed light on this reaction, the interaction between 2&#8208;napthol and the Fe  III  (Psalen) complexes was studied by cyclic voltammetry as well as UV&#8208;vis spectrosocopy.</dc:description>

      <title>Selective Release of Doxorubicin from Cucurbit[8]uril Stabilized Gold Supra&#8208;pyramid&#160;Host at pH of Small Intestine</title>
      <dc:description>Gold supra&#8208;pyramid structures were obtained by the addition of acidic solution of cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) to an aqueous solution of citrate stabilized gold nanoparticles (AuNP). The reaction resulted in the precipitation of supra&#8208;pyramid from the solution just after 1 min of shaking. Microscopic images confirmed formation of supra&#8208;pyramid. The stepwise structural transformation towards supra&#8208;pyramid was examined with variable concentration of CB[8] to AuNP solution. Anionic counter parts of these acids (Br&#8211;, NO3&#8211;, SO42&#8211;&#160;and Cl&#8211;) controlled the size of the synthesized supra&#8208;pyramids. These supra&#8208;pyramid hosts showed uptake of three anticancer drugs: oral drugs etoposide, prednisolone and intravenous drug doxorubicin. Releases of drugs from these hosts were emulated at acidic stomach pH, basic small intestinal pH and in presence of human serum albumin (HSA). The specific release of doxorubicin was confirmed at small intestinal pH 7.4. Poor release of drugs in presence of CB[8] specific guest 1&#8208;adamantanamine confirmed the role of supra&#8208;pyramid as exclusive host. The release of doxorubicin from supra&#8208;pyramid at pH 7.4 was confirmed by fluorescence microscopic imaging with prostate cancer DU&#8208;145 cell line.</dc:description>

These results enable the application of hydrogel to make an intrinsically stretchable and compressible supercapacitor after doping ions and the adhesion of commercially available carbon nanotube (CNT) paper as electrodes, giving the ionic conductivity as 17.0 mS/cm (comparable to that of the commercial PVA/H3PO4 electrolyte) and the capacitance as 0.87 uF/cm2 (at the scan speed of 100 mV/s), and its capacitance can be further enhanced under the stretching.</dc:description>

      <title>Unraveling Benignant Microstructure Evolution in Pyrite for Boosted Lithium Storage Performance</title>
      <dc:description>Pyrite FeS2 as a high&#8208;capacity electrode material for lithium ion batteries (LIBs) is hindered by its unstable cycling performance due to the large volume change and irreversible phase segregation from coarsening of Fe. Here, we unravel the benignant microstructure evolution in MoS2&#8208;modified FeS2 as an anode for LIBs during the cycling process that is responsible for its significantly boosted lithium storage performances. Specifically, the FeS2/MoS2 displays a long cycle life with a capacity retention of 116% after 600 cycles at 0.5 A g&#8208;1, which is the best among the reported FeS2&#8208;based materials so far. A series of electrochemical tests and structural characterizations substantially revealed that the introduced MoS2 in FeS2 experiences an irreversible electrochemical reaction and thus the in&#8208;situ formed metallic Mo could act as the conductive buffer layer to accelerate the dynamics of Li+ diffusion and electron transport. More importantly, it can guarantee the highly reversible conversion in lithiated FeS2 by preventing Fe coarsening. This work provides a fundamental understanding and an effective strategy towards the microstructure evolution for boosting lithium storage performances for other metal sulfide&#8208;based materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Separating Growth from Nucleation for Facile Control over the Size and Shape of Palladium Nanocrystals</title>
      <dc:description>In order to maximize the performance of nanocrystals in a specific application, it is necessary to control both their size and shape. Here we report a one&#8208;pot protocol that allows us to separate growth from nucleation for achieving better controls over the size and shape of Pd nanocrystals. The two processes are temporally separated from each other, although the synthesis is carried out in the same reaction container. Size control is achieved by simply varying the ratio between the amounts of precursor allocated to the growth and nucleation processes. With the involvement of seeds at a fixed number, increasing the amount of precursor for growth leads to increasingly larger nanocrystals. Shape control is made possible by varying the capping agent, with bromide leading to a cubic shape and citrate inducing the formation of an octahedral shape. The synthesis can also be scaled up by at least 10&#8208;fold without compromising the quality.</dc:description>

      <title>The &#8220;Inverted Bonds&#8221; Revisited: Analysis of &#8220;In Silico&#8221; Models and of [1.1.1]Propellane by Using Orbital Forces
</title>
      <dc:description>
Inverted or not? &#8220;In silico&#8221; models and molecular orbital analysis by using dynamic orbital forces (DOFs) lead to the conclusion that the so&#8208;called &#8220;inverted bond&#8221; in propellane (&#963; bond resulting from overlap of the smaller lobes of sp hybrids) has an energy close to zero. The bonding is only due to &#960;&#8208;type interactions with an energy of about 50&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1.







Abstract
This article dwells on the nature of &#8220;inverted bonds&#8221;, which refer to the &#963; interaction between two sp hybrids by their smaller lobes, and their presence in [1.1.1]propellane. Firstly, we study H3C&#8722;C models of C&#8722;C bonds with frozen H&#8208;C&#8208;C angles reproducing the constraints of various degrees of &#8220;inversion&#8221;. Secondly, the molecular orbital (MO) properties of [1.1.1]propellane and [1.1.1]bicyclopentane are analyzed with the help of orbital forces as a criterion of bonding/antibonding character and as a basis to evaluate bond energies. Triplet and cationic states of [1.1.1]propellane species are also considered to confirm the bonding/antibonding character of MOs in the parent molecule. These approaches show an essentially non&#8208;bonding character of the &#963; central C&#8722;C interaction in propellane. Within the MO theory, this bonding is thus only due to &#960;&#8208;type MOs (also called &#8220;banana&#8221; MOs or &#8220;bridge&#8221; MOs) and its total energy is evaluated to approximately 50&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. In bicyclopentane, despite a strong &#963;&#8208;type repulsion, a weak bonding (15&#8211;20&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) exists between both central C&#8722;C bonds, also due to &#960;&#8208;type interactions, though no bond is present in the Lewis structure. Overall, the so&#8208;called &#8220;inverted&#8221; bond, as resulting from a &#963; overlap of the two sp hybrids by their smaller lobes, appears highly questionable.

Self&#8208;assembly is a process in which a disordered system spontaneously develops ordered structures without external directions. In materials science and technology, self&#8208;assembly in the bulk has been extensively utilized to fabricate desired microscopic structures. Rodlike molecules have emerged as one of the most promising molecular building blocks to construct functional materials. Although the self&#8208;assembly of conventional molecules containing rodlike components generally results in nematic or layered smectic phases, extensive efforts have revealed that rational molecular design provides a versatile platform to engineer rich self&#8208;assembled structures. In their Review article on page&#8197;6741&#8197;ff., Feng, Lin and Cheng et&#8197;al. summarize the first successes achieved in polyphilic liquid crystals and rod&#8211;coil block systems. Special attention is paid to recent progress in the conjugation of rodlike building blocks with other molecular building blocks through the molecular Lego approach.

      <title>Frontispiece: Chemical Synthesis of Magnetic Nanoparticles for Permanent Magnet Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Chemical synthesis based on solution&#8208;phase reactions has attracted much attention in the synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) owing to its potential to achieve the desired size, morphology, structure, and magnetic controls. In their Minireview article on page&#8197;6757&#8197;ff., B. Shen and S. Sun focus on the recent chemical syntheses of strongly ferromagnetic MNPs (Hc&gt;10&#8197;kOe) of rare&#8208;earth metals and FePt intermetallic alloys. The potential of enhancing the magnetic performance of MNP composites by assembly of hard and soft MNPs into exchange&#8208;coupled nanocomposites is also discussed. High&#8208;performance nanocomposites are key to fabricating super&#8208;strong permanent magnets for magnetic, electronic, and energy applications.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chemical synthesis based on solution&#8208;phase reactions &lt;/b&gt; has attracted much attention in the synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) owing to its potential to achieve the desired size, morphology, structure, and magnetic controls. In their Minireview article on &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.201902916page&#8197;6757&#8197;ff.&lt;/a&gt;, B. Shen and S. Sun focus on the recent chemical syntheses of strongly ferromagnetic MNPs (&lt;i&gt;H &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;gt;10&#8197;kOe) of rare&#8208;earth metals and FePt intermetallic alloys. The potential of enhancing the magnetic performance of MNP composites by assembly of hard and soft MNPs into exchange&#8208;coupled nanocomposites is also discussed. High&#8208;performance nanocomposites are key to fabricating super&#8208;strong permanent magnets for magnetic, electronic, and energy applications.

      <dc:description>
The most stable nitroxides of the diaryl&#8208;type known to date (&#964;1/2 in benzene exceeds three months, as it is illustrated in the cover art) are presented. As an efficient structural &#8220;instrument&#8221; for stabilization of both open&#8208;shell and ionic states of diaryl nitroxides, the &#945;&#8208;methylcyclopropyl group with conformationally dependent electronic properties is suggested. Conformational switching of the cyclopropyl orientation relatively to the adjacent aromatic &#960; system as dependent on the nitroxide's redox state, are confirmed by DFT calculations and experimental results.

      <title>Chemical Synthesis of Magnetic Nanoparticles for Permanent Magnet Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Hard magnetic nanomaterials: Chemical synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles has received great attention owing to its advantages, which lead to the desired control of the magnetic properties. This Minireview highlights recent developments in the chemical synthesis of hard magnetic nanoparticles and exchange&#8208;coupled nanocomposites for permanent magnet applications.







Abstract
Permanent magnets are a class of critical materials for information storage, energy storage, and other magneto&#8208;electronic applications. Compared with conventional bulk magnets, magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) show unique size&#8208;dependent magnetic properties, which make it possible to control and optimize their magnetic performance for specific applications. The synthesis of MNPs has been intensively explored in recent years. Among different methods developed thus far, chemical synthesis based on solution&#8208;phase reactions has attracted much attention owing to its potential to achieve the desired size, morphology, structure, and magnetic controls. This Minireview focuses on the recent chemical syntheses of strongly ferromagnetic MNPs (Hc&gt;10&#8197;kOe) of rare&#8208;earth metals and FePt intermetallic alloys. It further discusses the potential of enhancing the magnetic performance of MNP composites by assembly of hard and soft MNPs into exchange&#8208;coupled nanocomposites. High&#8208;performance nanocomposites are key to fabricating super&#8208;strong permanent magnets for magnetic, electronic, and energy applications.

      <title>Triquinoline vs Fullerene based cycloparaphenylene ionic complexes. Comparison of photoinduced charge&#8208;shift reactions.</title>
      <dc:description>A triquinoline cationic moiety (TQ&#8226;H+) has recently been designed as a novel molecular unit for supramolecular chemistry. In addition to some useful features, TQ&#8226;H+ has strong electron acceptor properties which make the molecular cation to be a unique element in nano&#8208;chemistry. TQ&#8226;H+ is found to form complexes with coronene (COR) and cycloparaphenylene (CPP). In this work, we report a computational study of photoinduced electron transfer (PET) in supramolecular complexes TQ&#8226;H+&#8211;COR, TQ&#8226;H+&#8834;[12]CPP and (TQ&#8226;H+&#8211;COR)&#8834;[12]CPP. The electron transfer rates are estimated by using the semi&#8208;classical approach. The calculation results are compared with the data previously obtained for a structurally similar inclusion complex Li+@C60&#8834;[10]CPP. In particular, we find a red solvatochromic shift for charge&#8208;shift bands in the TQ&#8226;H+&#8208;complexes unlike a blue shift showed by Li+@C60&#8834;[10]CPP. This distinction is explored in terms of electronic and structural features of the systems.</dc:description>

This distinction is explored in terms of electronic and structural features of the systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Activity&#8208;directed synthesis of inhibitors of the p53/hDM2 protein&#8208;protein interaction</title>
      <dc:description>Protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs) provide a rich source of potential targets for drug discovery and biomedical science research.  However, the identification of structural&#8208;diverse starting points for discovery of PPI inhibitors remains a significant challenge.  Activity&#8208;directed synthesis (ADS), a function&#8208;driven discovery approach, was harnessed in the discovery of the p53/hDM2 PPI.  Over two rounds of ADS, 346 microscale reactions were performed, with prioritisation on the basis of the activity of the resulting product mixtures.  Four distinct and novel series of PPI inhibitors were discovered that, through biophysical characterisation, were shown to have promising ligand efficiencies.  It was thus shown that ADS can facilitate ligand discovery for a target that does not have a defined small&#8208;molecule binding site, and can provide distinctive starting points for the discovery of PPI inhibitors.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of chiral MOF&#8208;74 frameworks by post&#8208;synthetic modification using an amino acid</title>
      <dc:description>The synthesis of chiral metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is highly relevant for asymmetric heterogenous catalysis, yet very challenging. Chiral MOFs with MOF&#8208;74 topology were synthesized using post&#8208;synthetic modification with proline. Vibrational circular dichroism studies demonstrate that proline is the source of chirality. The solvents used in the synthesis play a key role in tuning the loading of proline and its interaction with the MOF&#8208;74 framework. In N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethylformamide, proline coordinates monodentate to the Zn  2+  ions within the MOF&#8208;74 framework, whilst it is only weakly bound to the framework when using methanol as solvent. Introducing chirality within the MOF&#8208;74 framework also leads to the formation of defects, with both the organic linker and metal ions missing from the framework. The formation of defects combined with the coordination of DMF and proline within the framework leads to a pore blocking effect. This is confirmed by adsorption studies and testing of the chiral MOFs in the asymmetric aldol reaction between acetone and  para  &#8208;nitrobenzaldehyde.</dc:description>

      <title>Flavonoids with Vicinal Hydroxyl Groups Inhibit Human Calcitonin Amyloid Formation</title>
      <dc:description>Human calcitonin (hCT) is a 32&#8208;residue peptide hormone that can aggregate into amyloid fibrils and cause cellular toxicity. In this study, we investigated the inhibition effects of a group of polyphenolic molecules on hCT amyloid formation. Our results suggest that the gallate moiety in epigallocatechin&#8208;3&#8208;gallate (EGCG), a well&#8208;recognized amyloid inhibitor, is not critical for its inhibition activity of the hCT amyloid formation. Our results demonstrate that the flavonoid compounds such as myricetin, quercetin, and baicalein that contain vicinal hydroxyl groups on the phenyl ring effectively prevent hCT fibrillization. This structural feature can also be applied to non&#8208;flavonoid polyphenolic inhibitors. Moreover, our results indicate a plausible mechanistic role of these vicinal hydroxyl groups which might include the oxidation to form a quinone and the subsequent Schiff base formation with the lysine or histidine residues of hCT. This may further disrupt the crucial electrostatic and aromatic interactions involved in the process of hCT amyloid fibril formation. The inhibition activity of the polyphenolic compounds against hCT fibril formation may likely be attributed to a combination of factors such as Schiff base formation, aromatic stacking, and hydrogen bonding interactions.</dc:description>

      <title>Simplified Synthesis of Biomass Derived Si/C Composite as a Stable Anode Material for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Synthesis of silicon/carbon (Si/C) by biomass resources enables the effective utilization of agricultural products in battery industries because of economical as well as environmental considerations. Herein, a simplified process was developed to synthesize Si/C from biomass, using low&#8208;cost agricultural by&#8208;products &#8220;rice husk (RH)&#8221; as a model. This process includes the calcination of RH for SiO2/C and the reduction of SiO2/C by Al in molten salts at a moderate temperature. This process does not need the removal of carbon before the thermal reduction of SiO  2  , which is thought to be very necessary to avoid the formation of SiC at elevated temperatures. So carbon derived from biomass can be directly used for Si/C as the anode material. The resultant Si/C shows a high reversible capacity of 1309 mAh g  &#8208;1  and long cycle life (300 cycles). Our research advocates a new and simplified strategy for the synthesis of RH&#8208;biomass&#8208;derived Si/C, which is beneficial for low&#8208;cost, environment&#8208;friendly and green energy storage applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Atomically Precise Alloy Nanoclusters</title>
      <dc:description>Metal nanoclusters (NCs) have a particle size of about one nanometer, which makes them the smallest unit that can give a function to a substance. In addition, metal NCs possess physical and chemical properties that are different from those of corresponding bulk metals. Metal NCs with such characteristics are expected to be important for use in nanotechnology. Research on the precise synthesis of metal NCs and elucidation of their physical/chemical properties and functions is being actively conducted. When metal NCs are alloyed, it is possible to obtain further various electronic and geometrical structures and functions. Thus, research on alloy NCs has become a hot topic in the study of metal NCs and the number of publications on alloy NCs has increased explosively in recent years. Such publications have provided much insight into the effects of alloying on the electronic structure and function of metal NCs. However, the rapid increase in knowledge has made it difficult for researchers (especially those new to the field) to grasp all of it. Therefore, in this review, we summarize the reported chemical composition, geometrical structure, electronic structure, and physical and chemical properties of Au  n&#8722;x  M  x  (SR)  m  , Ag  n&#8722;x  M  x  (SR)  m  , Au  n&#8722;x  M  x  (PR  3  )  l  (SR)  m  , and Ag  n&#8722;x  M  x  (PR  3  )  l  (SR)  m  (Au = gold, Ag = silver, M = heteroatom, PR  3  = phosphine, and SR = thiolate) NCs.

      <title>DNA&#8208;targeted NO release photoregulated by green light</title>
      <dc:description>We have designed and synthesized a novel molecular hybrid in which acridine orange (AO) is covalently linked to an N&#8208;nitrosoaniline derivative through an alkyl spacer. Photoexcitation of the AO antenna with the highly biocompatible green light results in intense fluorescence emission and triggers the NO detachment from the N&#8208;nitroso appendage  via  an intramolecular electron transfer. The presence of the AO moiety encourages the binding with DNA through both external and partially intercalative fashions, depending on the DNA:molecular hybrid molar ratio. Importantly, this dual&#8208;mode binding interaction with the biopolymer does not preclude the NO photoreleasing performances of the molecular hybrid, permitting NO to be photogenerated nearby DNA with an efficiency similar to that of the free molecule. These properties make the presented compound an intriguing candidate for fundamental and potential applicative research studies where NO delivery in the DNA proximity precisely regulated by the harmless green light is required.</dc:description>

      <title>Water&#8208;soluble rhenium clusters with triazoles: the effect of chemical structure on cellular internalization and the DNA binding of the complexes</title>

Specifically, the paper describes the synthesis and detailed characterization of the structure, luminescence and electrochemical properties of the four new Re  6  clusters with 1,2,3&#8208; and 1,2,4&#8208;triazoles. Biological assays of these complexes are also discussed in addition to those with benzotriazole using cervical cancer (HeLa) and immortalized human fibroblasts (CRL&#8208;4025) as model cell lines. Our study demonstrates that the presence of hydrophobic and &#960;&#8208;bonding rich units such as the benzene ring in benzotriazole significantly enhances cellular internalization of rhenium clusters. These ligands facilitate binding of the clusters to DNA, which results in increased cytotoxicity of the complexes.</dc:description>

      <title>Controllable Synthesis of Fe&#8208;doped NiCo2O4 Nanobelts as Superior Catalysts for Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>As one of the promising clean and renewable technologies, water splitting has been a hot issue, especially the half&#8208;reaction of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to its sluggish and complex kinetics. Hence, the Fe&#8208;doped NiCo2O4 nanobelts were designed and prepared as catalysts toward OER. By increasing the Fe amount, the catalytic performances of the as&#8208;synthesized products went up and then decreased. Profiting from the synergistic effect between Fe atom and NiCo2O4, all the Fe&#8208;NiCo2O4 catalysts exhibited superior catalytic activities to the corresponding NiCo2O4. In addition, the characteristic nanobelt architecture facilitates the conduction of electrons and the exposure of active sites. With the optimal Fe content, the 9.1% Fe&#8208;NiCo2O4 yielded the smallest overpotential and Tafel slope among the catalysts, distinctly lower than that of RuO2.</dc:description>

      <title>Highly efficient transfer hydrogenation catalysis with tailored pyridylidene amide pincer ruthenium complexes</title>
      <dc:description>The rational optimization of homogeneous catalysts requires ligand platforms that are easily tailored to improve catalytic performance. Here, we demonstrate that pyridylidene amides (PYAs) provide such a platform to custom&#8208;shape transfer hydrogenation catalysts to exceptional activity. Specifically, a series of mesoionic PYA pincer ligands with differently substituted PYA units has been synthezised and coordinated to ruthenium(II) centres to form bench&#8208;stable&#160;complexes [Ru(R&#8208;PYA&#8208;pincer)(MeCN)  3  ](PF  6  )  2  &#160;(R&#160;= OMe, Me, H, Cl, CF  3  ). Analytic studies (NMR spectroscopy, electrochemistry, crystallography) reveal a direct influence of the substituents on the electronic properties of the ruthenium center. The complexes are active in the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of ketones, with activities directly encoded by the PYA substitution pattern. Their perfomance improves further upon exchange of an ancillary MeCN ligand with PPh  3  .

Tricopper&#8208;oxo clusters [Cu3(&#956;&#8208;O)3]2+ hosted in mordenite can selectively oxidize methane to methanol but yields are limited.

Iridium, the &#8220;rainbow&#8221; element, is the element with the highest attainable formal oxidation state of +IX. The goal of this work was to produce neutral Ir+IXN3 by reacting excited iridium atoms with dinitrogen. This reaction leads to a cornucopia of iridium nitrogen compounds identified by FTIR spectroscopy under cryogenic conditions. Quantum chemical calculations give insight to their electronic structure. The product molecules are discussed with emphases on oxidation states and dinitrogen activation. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S.&#8197;Riedel et&#8197;al.

      <title>Multivariate Analysis of Coupled Operando EPR/XANES/EXAFS/UV&#8211;Vis/ATR&#8208;IR Spectroscopy: A New Dimension for Mechanistic Studies of Catalytic Gas&#8208;Liquid Phase Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Four eyes see more than two: Operando EPR, XANES/EXAFS, ATR&#8208;IR, and UV/Vis spectroscopy have been coupled in the same experiment to complete the mechanistic puzzle in selective aerobic alcohol oxidation by a copper&#8208;TEMPO catalyst. The reaction is driven by a single CuI/CuII redox cycle that activates O2 with the help of TEMPO. Dimeric CuII&#8211;CuII species have no catalytic impact since they dissolve in the early stage of the reaction without activity loss. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J. Rabeah, V. Briois, A. Br&#252;ckner, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202000436).

      <title>Magnetic Phase Transitions in a Ni4O4&#8208;Cubane&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
      <dc:description>
A remarkable Ni4O4&#8211;cubane&#8208;based coordination framework has been shown to display unusual low&#8208;temperature magnetic behavior. The 3D coordination network consists of perpendicular chains of NiII ions linked by 1,4&#8208;phenylene diacetate ligands and bridged by the Ni4O4&#8211;cubane units. It was found to undergo a magnetic ordering at &#8764;24&#8197;K into an antiferromagnetic or partially spin&#8208;compensated phase, but then to also display a pronounced magnetic hysteresis below &#8764;3&#8197;K. The authors conclude that this is due to a structural phase transition. More information can be found in the Full Paper by P. K&#246;gerler, J.&#8197;A. Stride, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202000867).

It was found to undergo a magnetic ordering at &#8764;24&#8197;K into an antiferromagnetic or partially spin&#8208;compensated phase, but then to also display a pronounced magnetic hysteresis below &#8764;3&#8197;K. The authors conclude that this is due to a structural phase transition. More information can be found in the Full Paper by P. K&#246;gerler, J.&#8197;A. Stride, et&#8197;al.

      <dc:description>
Post&#8208;metalation modification based on ligand exchange on the metal centers is a useful strategy to control the guest recognition behavior of a metal&#8208;containing macrocyclic host. The two axial piperidine ligands at diagonal positions in the cobalt(III) dinuclear macrocyclic host, [LCo2(pip)4]2+ (pip=piperidine), were site&#8208;selectively replaced with pyridine or acetato ligands. The replacement with acetato ligands significantly enhanced the Na+ recognition ability. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S. Akine et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202001072).

      <title>Enhancing the Activity of Drugs by Conjugation to Organometallic Fragments</title>
      <dc:description>
There is an urgent clinical need for new agents to treat microbial infections and cancer, especially to combat resistance to current drugs. The successful strategy of conjugating existing drugs to organometallic fragments is illustrated with examples of conjugated organometallic metallocene sandwich and half&#8208;sandwich complexes, especially ferrocene, RuII and OsII arene, and RhIII and IrIII cyclopentadienyl complexes.







Abstract
Resistance to chemotherapy is a current clinical problem, especially in the treatment of microbial infections and cancer. One strategy to overcome this is to make new derivatives of existing drugs by conjugation to organometallic fragments, either by an appropriate linker, or by direct coordination of the drug to a metal. We illustrate this with examples of conjugated organometallic metallocene sandwich and half&#8208;sandwich complexes, RuII and OsII arene, and RhIII and IrIII cyclopentadienyl half&#8208;sandwich complexes. Ferrocene conjugates are particularly promising. The ferrocene&#8211;chloroquine conjugate ferroquine is in clinical trials for malaria treatment, and a ferrocene&#8208;tamoxifen derivative (a ferrocifen) seems likely to enter anticancer trails soon. Several other examples illustrate that organometallic conjugation can restore the activity of drugs to which resistance has developed.

      <title>DMT1 Inhibitors Kill Cancer Stem Cells by Blocking Lysosomal Iron Translocation</title>
      <dc:description>
Blocked by iron: Inhibitors of the divalent metal transporter&#8197;1 (DMT1) have been identified that kill cancer stem cells by blocking lysosomal iron translocation. This leads to lysosomal iron accumulation, production of reactive oxygen species and cell death. Taken together, this provides opportunities for the development of new cancer treatment modalities involving DMT1 inhibitors.







Abstract
Cancer stem cells (CSC) constitute a cell subpopulation in solid tumors that is responsible for resistance to conventional chemotherapy, metastasis and cancer relapse. The natural product Salinomycin can selectively target this cell niche by directly interacting with lysosomal iron, taking advantage of upregulated iron homeostasis in CSC. Here, inhibitors of the divalent metal transporter&#8197;1 (DMT1) have been identified that selectively target CSC by blocking lysosomal iron translocation. This leads to lysosomal iron accumulation, production of reactive oxygen species and cell death with features of ferroptosis. DMT1 inhibitors selectively target CSC in primary cancer cells and circulating tumor cells, demonstrating the physiological relevance of this strategy. Taken together, this opens up opportunities to tackle unmet needs in anti&#8208;cancer therapy.

      <title>Consecutive Photoinduced Electron Transfer (conPET): The Mechanism of the Photocatalyst Rhodamine&#8197;6G</title>
      <dc:description>
Consecutive PET. The excitation of rhodamine&#8197;6G (R6G+) with green light (540&#8197;nm) in the presence of N,N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine generates two rhodamine radicals. Excitation of these radicals with blue light (420&#8197;nm) enables reduction of aromatic bromides. Femtosecond spectroscopy reveals that the lifetime of the excited state (350&#8197;fs) is too short for diffusion&#8208;controlled electron transfer, pointing to solvated electrons as intermediates.







Abstract
The dye rhodamine&#8197;6G can act as a photocatalyst through photoinduced electron transfer. After electronic excitation with green light, rhodamine&#8197;6G takes an electron from an electron donor, such as N,N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine, and forms the rhodamine&#8197;6G radical. This radical has a reduction potential of around &#8722;0.90&#8197;V and can split phenyl iodide into iodine anions and phenyl radicals. Recently, it has been reported that photoexcitation of the radical at 420&#8197;nm splits aryl bromides into bromide anions and aryl radicals. This requires an increase in reduction potential, hence the electronically excited rhodamine&#8197;6G radical was proposed as the reducing agent. Here, we present a study of the mechanism of the formation and photoreactions of the rhodamine&#8197;6G radical by transient absorption spectroscopy in the time range from femtoseconds to minutes in combination with quantum chemical calculations. We conclude that one photon of 540&#8197;nm light produces two rhodamine&#8197;6G radicals. The lifetime of the photoexcited radicals of around 350&#8197;fs is too short to allow diffusion&#8208;controlled interaction with a substrate. A fraction of the excited radicals ionize spontaneously, presumably producing solvated electrons. This decay produces hot rhodamine&#8197;6G and hot rhodamine&#8197;6G radicals, which cool with a time constant of around 10&#8197;ps. In the absence of a substrate, the ejected electrons recombine with rhodamine&#8197;6G and recover the radical on a timescale of nanoseconds. Photocatalytic reactions occur only upon excitation of the rhodamine&#8197;6G radical, and due to its short excited&#8208;state lifetime, the electron transfer to the substrate probably takes place through the generation of solvated electrons as an additional step in the proposed photochemical mechanism.

      <dc:description>Introducing solubilizing &#945;&#8208;branched alkyl chains on a poly(diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;  alt  &#8208;terthiophene) results in a dramatic change of the structural, optical, and electronic properties compared to the isomeric polymer carrying &#946;&#8208;branched alkyl side chains. When branched at the &#945;&#8208;position the alkyl substituent creates a steric hindrance that reduces the tendency of the polymer to &#960;&#8208;&#960; stack and endows the material with a much higher solubility in common organic solvents. The wider &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and reduced tendency to crystallize, evidenced from grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, result in a wider optical band gap in the solid state. In solar cells with a fullerene acceptor, the &#945;&#8208;branched isomer affords a higher open&#8208;circuit voltage, but an overall lower power conversion efficiency as a result of a too well&#8208;mixed nanomorphology. Due its reduced &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, the &#945;&#8208;branched isomer fluoresces and affords near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;emitting diodes emitting at 820 nm.</dc:description>

      <title>Alteration of the Conformational Dynamics of a DNA Hairpin by &#945;&#8208;Synuclein in the Presence of Aqueous Two&#8208;Phase Systems</title>
      <dc:description>We studied the effect of an amyloidogenic intrinsically disordered protein, &#945;&#8208;synuclein, which is associated with Parkinson's disease (PD), on the conformational dynamics of a DNA hairpin (DNA&#8208;HP) employing the single&#8208;molecule F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer method.

Formation of a protein&#8208;bound intermediate conformation is fostered in the presence of an aqueous two&#8208;phase system mimicking intracellular liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation. Using pressure modulation, additional mechanistic informa&#173;tion of the binding complex could be retrieved. Hence, in addition to toxic amyloid formation, &#945;&#8208;synuclein may alter expression profiles of disease&#8208;modifying genes in PD.

      <title>Biosynthetic Approaches Towards the Design of Artificial Hydrogen Evolution Catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>Hydrogen is a clean and sustainable form of fuel that can minimize our heavy dependence on fossil fuels as the primary energy source. The need of finding greener ways to generate H  2  gas has ignited interest in the research community to synthesize catalysts that can produce H  2  gas by the reduction of H  +  . The natural H  2  producing enzymes hydrogenases have served as an inspiration to produce catalytic metal centers akin to these native enzymes. In this article we describe recent advances in the design of a unique class of artificial hydrogen evolving catalysts that combine the features of the active site metal(s) surrounded by a polypeptide component. The examples of these biosynthetic catalysts discussed here include i) assemblies of synthetic cofactors with native proteins; ii) peptide&#8208;appended synthetic complexes; iii) substitution of native cofactors with non&#8208;native macrocyclic cofactors; iv) metal substitution from rubredoxin; and v) a reengineered Cu storage protein into a Ni binding protein.

      <title>Coronenohelicenes with Dynamic Chirality</title>
      <dc:description>The synthesis of a new type of chiral and dynamic non&#8208;planar aromatics containing a combination of fused perylene based coronenes and helicenes is reported. Either one or two helicene moieties were fused to the  bay  regions of an extended perylene core. The target compounds contain either identical or two different helicene building blocks. The combination with two helicene units leads to six different isomers, including two pairs of enantiomers and two meso forms. The experimental determination of the isomerization barriers the corresponding double [5]&#8208;helicenes revealed activation energies of  E  a  = 24.81 and 25.38 kcal/mol, which is slightly above the barrier of the parent [5]&#8208;helicene. Resolution of all possible regio&#8208; and stereoisomers allowed for the systematic investigation the chiroptical properties. They revealed remarkable dissymmetry factors &#1030;  g  abs  &#1030; of up to 1.2&#215;10  &#8208;2  that mirror the synergy between the strong absorbing perylenes and the inherent chirality of helicenes</dc:description>

The combination with two helicene units leads to six different isomers, including two pairs of enantiomers and two meso forms. The experimental determination of the isomerization barriers the corresponding double [5]&#8208;helicenes revealed activation energies of  E  a  = 24.81 and 25.38 kcal/mol, which is slightly above the barrier of the parent [5]&#8208;helicene. Resolution of all possible regio&#8208; and stereoisomers allowed for the systematic investigation the chiroptical properties. They revealed remarkable dissymmetry factors &#1030;  g  abs  &#1030; of up to 1.2&#215;10  &#8208;2  that mirror the synergy between the strong absorbing perylenes and the inherent chirality of helicenes&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Visible Light&#8208;Gated Organocatalysis Using a Ru(II)&#8208;Photocage</title>

As model reaction the acetylation of benzyl alcohols with acetic anhydride was chosen. The pre&#8208;catalyst releases one DMAP molecule on irradiation at wavelengths longer than 455 nm. The photochemical process was characterized by steady&#8208;state irradiation and ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy. The latter enabled the observation of the 3MLCT state and the spectral features of the penta&#8208;coordinated intermediate [Ru(bpy)  2  (DMAP)]  2+  . The released DMAP catalyzes the acetylation of a wide range of benzyl alcohols with chemical yields of up to 99%. Control experiments revealed unequivocally that it is the released DMAP which takes the role of the catalyst.</dc:description>

      <title>P450J&#945; &#8208; A new, robust and  &#945;&#8208;selective fatty acid hydroxylase displaying unexpected 1&#8208;alkene formation</title>
      <dc:description>Oxyfunctionalization of fatty acids (FAs) is a key step in the design of novel synthetic pathways for bio&#8208;based/bio&#8208;degradable polymers, surfactants and fuels. Here, we show the isolation and characterization of a robust FA &#945;&#8208;hydroxylase (P450  J&#945;  ) which catalyses the selective conversion of a broad range of FAs (C6:0&#8208;C16:0) and oleic acid (C18:1) with H  2  O  2  as oxidant. Under optimized reaction conditions P450  J&#945;  yields &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acids all with &gt;95% regioselectivity, high specific activity (up to 15.2 U mg  &#8208;1  ) and efficient coupling of oxidant to product (up to 85%). Lauric acid (C12:0) turned out to be an excellent substrate with respect to productivity (TON = 394 min  &#8208;1  ). On preparative scale, conversion of C12:0 reached 83% (0.9 g L  &#8208;1  ) when supplementing H  2  O  2  in fed&#8208;batch mode. Under similar conditions P450  J&#945;  allowed further the first biocatalytic &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation of oleic acid (88% conversion on 100 mL scale) at high selectivity and in good yields (1.1 g L  &#8208;1  ; 79% isolated yield). Unexpectedly, P450  J&#945;  displayed also 1&#8208;alkene formation from shorter chain FAs (&#8804; C10:0) showing that oxidative decarboxylation is more widely distributed across this enzyme family than reported previously.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>C&#8208;type lectin receptor (CLR) carbohydrate binding proteins found on immune cells with important functions in pathogen recognition and self and non&#8208;self&#8208;differentiation are increasingly moving into the focus of drug developers as targets for the immune therapy of cancer autoimmune diseases and inflammation and to improve the efficacy of vaccines. The development of molecules with increased affinity and selectivity over the natural glycan binders has largely focused on the synthesis of mono and disaccharide mimetics but glycan array binding experiments have shown increased binding selectivity and affinity for selected larger oligosaccharides that are able to engage in additional favorable interactions beyond the primary binding site. Here we present a platform for the rapid preparation and screening of N&#8208;glycan mimetics on microarrays that turns a panel of complex glycan core structures into structurally diverse glycomimetics by a combination of enzymatic glycosylation with non&#8208;natural donors and subsequent cycloaddition with a collection of alkynes. All surface based reactions were monitored by MALDI&#8208;Tof MS to assess conversion and purity of spot compositions. Screening the collection of 374 N&#8208;glycomimetics against the plant lectin WFA and the 2 human immune lectins MGL and Langerin produced a number of high affinity binders as lead structures for more selective lectin targeting probes.</dc:description>

      <title>Tuning the outcome&#160;of enzyme&#8208;mediated dynamic cyclodextrin libraries to&#160;enhance&#160;template effects</title>
      <dc:description>Enzyme&#8208;mediated dynamic combinatorial chemistry combines the concept of thermodynamically controlled covalent self&#8208;assembly with the inherent biological relevance of enzymatic transformations. We explore a system of interconverting cyclodextrins wherein the glycosidic linkage is rendered dynamic by the action of cyclodextrin glucanotransferase (CGTase). We report that external factors, such as pH, temperature, solvent, and salinity can be modulated to influence the composition of the dynamic cyclodextrin library. Dynamic libraries of cyclodextrins (CDs) could be obtained in wide ranges of pH (5.0 &#8208; &#160;9.0), temperature (5 &#8208;&#160;37 &#186;C), and salinity (up to 7.5 M NaNO  3  ), and with high organic solvent content (50% by volume of ethanol), showing that enzyme&#8208;mediated dynamic systems can be robust and not limited to physiological conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate how strategic choice of reaction conditions can enhance template effects, in this case, to achieve highly selective production &#945;&#8208;CD, an otherwise challenging target due to competition from the structurally similar&#160;&#946;&#8208;CD.</dc:description>

      <title>Stepwise Assembly of an Electroactive Framework from a Co6S8 Superatomic Metalloligand and Cuprous Iodide Building Units</title>
      <dc:description>The design of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) that incorporate more than one metal cluster constituent is a challenging task. Conventional one&#8208;pot reaction protocols require judicious selection of ligand and metal ion precursors, yet remain unpredictable. Stable, preformed nanoclusters, with ligand shells that can undergo additional coordination&#8208;driven reactions, provide a platform for assembling multi&#8208;cluster solids with precision. Herein, a discrete Co6S8 (PTA) 6 (PTA = 1,3,5&#8208;triaza&#8208;7&#8208;phosphaadamantane) superatomic&#8208;metalloligand is assembled into a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) coordination polymer comprising Cu4I4 secondary building units (SBUs). The resulting heterobimetallic framework ( 1 ) contains two distinct cluster constituents and bifunctional PTA linkers. Solid&#8208;state diffuse reflectance studies reveal that 1 is an optical semiconductor with a band&#8208;gap of 1.59 eV. Framework&#8208;modified electrodes exhibit reversible redox behavior in the solid state arising from the Co6S8&#160;superatoms, which remain intact during framework synthesis.</dc:description>

      <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Miniemulsion&#8208;Based Routes for Synthesis of Metal Oxides</title>
      <dc:description>The use of miniemulsions containing chemical precursors in the disperse phase is a versatile method to produce nanoparticles and nanostructures of different chemical nature, including not only polymers, but also a variety of inorganic materials. This minireview focuses on materials in which nanostructures of metal oxides are synthesized in processes that involve the miniemulsion technique in any of the steps. This includes in the first place those approaches in which the spaces provided by nanodroplets are directly used to confine precipitation reactions that lead eventually to oxides. On the other hand, miniemulsions can also be used to form functionalized polymer nanoparticles that can serve either as supports or as controlling agents for the synthesis of metal oxides. Herein, the description of essential aspects of the methods is combined with the most representative examples reported in the last years for each strategy.</dc:description>

      <title>Unveiling VIVO2+ binding modes to human serum albumins by an integrated spectroscopic&#8208;computational approach</title>
      <dc:description>Human serum albumin (HSA) is involved in the transport of metal ions and potential metallodrugs. Depending on the metal, several sites are available, among which  N  &#8208;terminal (NTS) and multi&#8208;metal binding site (MBS). Despite the large number of X&#8208;ray determinations for albumins, only one structure with Zn2+  is available. In this work, the binding to HSA of VIVO2+  ion was studied by an integrated approach based on spectroscopic and computational methods, which allowed to characterize the systems even in the absence of an X&#8208;ray analysis. The behavior depends on the type of albumin, defatted (HSAd) or fatted (HSAf). With HSAd  &#8216;primary&#8217; and &#8216;secondary&#8217; sites were revealed, NTS with (His3, His9, Asp13, Asp255) and MBS with (His67, His247, Asp249, Asn99 or H2O); with increasing the ratio VIVO2/HSAd, &#8216;tertiary&#8217; sites, with one His&#8208;N and others donors (Asp/Glu&#8208;O or carbonyl&#8208;O) are populated. With HSAf, fatty acids (FAs) cause a rotation of the subdomains IA and IIA, which results in the formation of a dinuclear ferromagnetic adduct (VIVO)2D(HSAf) with a &#956;1,1&#8208;Asp249 and the binding of His247, Glu100, Glu252 and His67 or Asn99.

      <title>Orthogonal Photoswitching Using Norbornadiene</title>
      <dc:description>Orthogonal photoswitching is a convenient but challenging way of controlling multiple functions in a system by selective photoisomerization of one unit before the other in any arbitrarily chosen sequence. Here we present this concept for the norbornadiene/quadricyclane (NBD/QC) photo/thermo&#8208;switch in the presence or absence of a coordinated metal ion. Thus, introducing two pyridyl ligands via ethyne&#8208;1,2&#8208;diyl bridges provides a system that by chelation of metal ions, such as Pd(II), has altered optical and switching properties. Mixing the Pd(II) complex with its free ligand furnishes a four&#8208;state system where NBD&#8208;to&#8208;QC photoisomerizations for complexed and uncomplexed species are controlled by the irradiation wavelength and can occur orthogonally, that is, the sequence of photoisomerizations can be swapped. Studies on Ag(I) and Pb(II) complexes, being less stable than the Pd(II) complex, are also presented; these exhibit like the Pd(II) complex significantly redshifted NBD absorptions.</dc:description>

      <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC)&#8208;Stabilized Ru0 Nanoparticles: In Situ Generation of an Efficient Transfer Hydrogenation Catalyst</title>
      <dc:description>
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;stabilized Ru0 nanoparticles (NPs) were generated in situ from tethered and untethered ruthenium half&#8208;sandwich complexes. These catalytically active Ru0 NPs were explored for transfer hydrogenation of aromatic ketones in 2&#8208;propanol. The transfer hydrogenation catalyzed by these NPs possess a high turnover number. The catalytic efficiency was significantly reduced if these NPs were exposed to air or allowed to aggregate and precipitate by cooling the reaction mixtures.







Abstract
Tethered and untethered ruthenium half&#8208;sandwich complexes were synthesized and characterized spectroscopically. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of three untethered and two tethered Ru N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes were also carried out. These RuNHC complexes catalyze transfer hydrogenation of aromatic ketones in 2&#8208;propanol under reflux, optimally in the presence of (25&#8197;mol&#8201;%) KOH. Under these conditions, the formation of 2&#8211;3&#8197;nm&#8208;sized Ru0 nanoparticles was detected by TEM measurements. A solid&#8208;state NMR investigation of the nanoparticles suggested that the NHC ligands were bound to the surface of the Ru nanoparticles (NPs). This base&#8208;promoted route to NHC&#8208;stabilized ruthenium nanoparticles directly from arene&#8208;tethered ruthenium&#8211;NHC complexes and from untethered ruthenium&#8211;NHC complexes is more convenient than previously known routes to NHC&#8208;stabilized Ru nanocatalysts. Similar catalytically active RuNPs were also generated from the reaction of a mixture of [RuCl2(p&#8208;cymene)]2 and the NHC precursor with KOH in isopropanol under reflux. The transfer hydrogenation catalyzed by these NHC&#8208;stabilized RuNPs possess a high turnover number. The catalytic efficiency was significantly reduced if nanoparticles were exposed to air or allowed to aggregate and precipitate by cooling the reaction mixtures during the reaction.

      <title>Evaluation of a Bispidine&#8208;Based Chelator for Gallium&#8208;68 and of the Porphyrin Conjugate as PET/PDT Theranostic Agent</title>
      <dc:description>
Go, go Gallium! In this study, a bispidine ligand has been applied to the complexation of gallium(III) and radiolabelled with gallium&#8208;68 for the first time. The resulting complex is stable in serum for over two hours, showing a ligand system perfectly matched to the imaging window of PET. To show the versatility of ligand the bifunctional chelator was conjugated to porphyrin, producing a PET/PDT&#8208;theranostic.

Abstract
In this study a bispidine ligand has been applied to the complexation of gallium(III) and radiolabelled with gallium&#8208;68 for the first time. Despite its 5&#8208;coordinate nature, the resulting complex is stable in serum for over two hours, demonstrating a ligand system well matched to the imaging window of gallium&#8208;68 positron emission tomography (PET). To show the versatility of the bispidine ligand and its potential use in PET, the bifunctional chelator was conjugated to a porphyrin, producing a PET/PDT&#8208;theranostic, which showed the same level of stability to serum as the non&#8208;conjugated gallium&#8208;68 complex. The PET/PDT complex killed &gt;90&#8201;% of HT&#8208;29 cells upon light irradiation at 50&#8197;&#956;m. This study shows bispidines have the versatility to be used as a ligand system for gallium&#8208;68 in PET.
