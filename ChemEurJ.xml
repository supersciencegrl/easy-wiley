         <title>Conformational Dependence of Triplet Energies in Rotationally&#8208;Hindered N&#8208; and S&#8208;Heterocyclic Dimers: New Design and Measurement Rules for High Triplet Energy OLED Host Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of four heterocyclic dimers has been synthesized, with twisted geometries imposed across the central linking bond by  ortho&#8208;alkoxy chains. These include two isomeric bicarbazoles, a bis(dibenzothiophene&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide) and a bis(thioxanthene&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide). Spectroscopic and electrochemical methods, supported by density functional theory, have given detailed insights into how  para&#8208; vs.  meta&#8208; vs. broken conjugation, and electron&#8208;rich vs. electron&#8208;poor heterocycles impact the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap and singlet and triplet energies. Crucially for applications as OLED hosts, the triplet energy (ET) of these molecules was found to vary significantly between dilute polymer films and neat films, related to conformational demands of the molecules in the solid state. One of the bicarbazole species shows a variation in  ET  of 0.24 eV in the different media &#8211; sufficiently large to &#8220;make&#8208;or&#8208;break&#8221; an OLED device &#8211; with similar discrepancies found between neat films and frozen solution measurements of other previously reported OLED hosts. From consolidated optical and optoelectronic investigations of different host/dopant combinations, we identify that only the lower  ET  values measured in neat films give a reliable indicator of host/guest compatibility. This work also provides new molecular design rules for obtaining very high  ET  materials and controlling their HOMO and LUMO energies.</dc:description>

         <title>Dipyrrinato&#8208;Iridium(III) Complexes for Application in Photodynamic Therapy and Antimicrobial Photodynamic Inactivation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heteroleptic dipyrrinato iridium complexes were synthesized and evaluated for their phototoxic activity against tumor cells and bacteria, the Gram&#8208;positive germ S. aureus and the Gram&#8208;negative Germ P. aeruginosa. Specifically, glycosylated phenylpyridyl&#8208;dipyrrinato complexes showed a high phototoxic effect against cells and S. aureus. Certain cyclopentadienyl&#8208;dipyrrinato complexes exerted a high phototoxic effect on S. aureus and P. aeruginosa.







Abstract
The generation of bio&#8208;targetable photosensitizers is of utmost importance to the emerging field of photodynamic therapy and antimicrobial (photo&#8208;)therapy. A synthetic strategy is presented in which chelating dipyrrin moieties are used to enhance the known photoactivity of iridium(III) metal complexes. Formed complexes can thus be functionalized in a facile manner with a range of targeting groups at their chemically active reaction sites. Dipyrrins with N&#8208; and O&#8208;substituents afforded (dipy)iridium(III) complexes via complexation with the respective Cp*&#8208;iridium(III) and ppy&#8208;iridium(III) precursors (dipy=dipyrrinato, Cp*=pentamethyl&#8208;&#951;5&#8208;cyclopentadienyl, ppy=2&#8208;phenylpyridyl). Similarly, electron&#8208;deficient [IrIII(dipy)(ppy)2] complexes could be used for post&#8208;functionalization, forming alkenyl, alkynyl and glyco&#8208;appended iridium(III) complexes. The phototoxic activity of these complexes has been assessed in cellular and bacterial assays with and without light; the [IrIII(Cl)(Cp*)(dipy)] complexes and the glyco&#8208;substituted iridium(III) complexes showing particular promise as photomedicine candidates. Representative crystal structures of the complexes are also presented.

         <title>Decorating Metal Nitrate with a Coplanar Bipyridine Moiety: A&#8201;Simple and General Method for Fabricating Photochromic Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Hybrid photochromic materials: A simple and general method for fabricating photochromic complexes by decorating metal nitrates with a coplanar 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline moiety under the collaboration of electron&#8208;transfer and coordination&#8208;assembly strategies is reported.







Abstract
As a significant class of photochromic materials, crystalline hybrid photochromic materials (CHPMs) have attracted widespread attention of researchers because of their possibilities for generating other photoresponsive properties and advantages in understanding the underlying relationship between structure and photoresponsive performance. The predesign of suitable ligands plays a major role in generating desirable CHPMs. Hitherto, most CHPMs have been built from photodeformable or photoresponsive tectons. However, the synthesis of these ligands is usually time&#8208;consuming and expensive, and this greatly restricts their large&#8208;scale preparation and practical application. Therefore, it is necessary to explore new families of CHPMs besides the existing CHPMs. Herein, a simple and general method for constructing CHPMs by decorating metal nitrate with a coplanar bipyridine moiety, namely 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (phen), is reported. The resulting products exhibit photocoloration in response to Xe&#8208;lamp irradiation. The electron transfer (ET) from the coplanar NO3&#8722; species (as &#960;&#8208;electron donors, &#960;&#8208;EDs) to coplanar phen moieties (as &#960;&#8208;electron acceptors, &#960;&#8208;EAs) is responsible for the resulting photochromism. The influence of the coordination environment and central metal ion on the photochromism was also studied. This work demonstrates that the introduction of coplanar organic tectons as &#960;&#8208;EAs to metal nitrates as &#960;&#8208;EDs with the collaboration of ET and coordination&#8208;assembly strategies is a simple and general method to manufacture CHPMs.

         <title>Multidentate, V&#8208;Shaped Pyridine Building Blocks as Tectons for Crystal Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Build better! Four new, multidentate pyridine&#8208;based building blocks have been synthesised to be used as tectons in crystal engineering. They comprise a V&#8208;shaped scaffold functionalised with different moieties, namely bromine atoms, carboxylic groups, triple bonds and amine groups. This endows the tectons with distinct steric, electrostatic, and self&#8208;assembly properties, directing their solid&#8208;state structures via the formation of supramolecular interactions.







Abstract
The formation of supramolecular structural units through self&#8208;assembly is a powerful method to design new architectures and materials endowed with specific properties. With the aim of adding a group of versatile tectons to the toolkit of crystal engineers, we have devised and synthesised four new V&#8208;shaped building blocks characterised by an aryl acetylene scaffold comprising three substituted pyridine rings connected by two triple bonds. The judicious choice of different substituents on the pyridine rings provides these tectons with distinctive steric, electrostatic and self&#8208;assembly properties, which influence their crystal structures and their ability to form co&#8208;crystals. Co&#8208;crystals of the tectons with tetraiododifluorobenzene were obtained both via traditional and mechanochemical crystallisation strategies, proving their potential use in crystal engineering. The energetic contributions of the supramolecular interactions at play in the crystal lattice have also been evaluated to better understand their nature and strength and to rationalise their role in designing molecular crystals.

         <title>2,3&#8208;Diarylbenzo[b]arsole: Structural Modification and Polymerization for Tuning of Photophysical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first synthesis and structural modification of 2,3&#8208;diarylbenzo[b]arsoles were performed by utilizing zirconacycles, Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling, and oxidation of the arsenic atom. In addition, main&#8208; and side&#8208;chain type polymers were synthesized, and the resultant polymers showed different emission behaviors such as aggregation caused quenching and aggregation induced emission enhancement.







Abstract
2,3&#8208;Diarylbenzo[b]arsoles were synthesized from zirconacycles and diiodophenylarsine. The structural modification to the luminophore was attained through diarylacetylene precursors, Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling, and oxidation of the arsenic atom. The emission properties were controlled according to these modifications. The 2,3&#8208;diarylbenzo[b]arsoles showed aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement; the stronger emission was observed in the solid states than in solutions. In addition, Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura polycondensation and olefin metathesis polymerization produced main&#8208; and side&#8208;chain polymers, respectively.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The first synthesis&lt;/b&gt; and structural modification of 2,3&#8208;diarylbenzo[&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]arsoles were performed by utilizing zirconacycles, Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling, and oxidation of the arsenic atom. In addition, main&#8208; and side&#8208;chain type polymers were synthesized, and the resultant polymers showed different emission behaviors such as aggregation caused quenching and aggregation induced emission enhancement.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2,3&#8208;Diarylbenzo[&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]arsoles were synthesized from zirconacycles and diiodophenylarsine. The structural modification to the luminophore was attained through diarylacetylene precursors, Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling, and oxidation of the arsenic atom. The emission properties were controlled according to these modifications. The 2,3&#8208;diarylbenzo[&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]arsoles showed aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement; the stronger emission was observed in the solid states than in solutions. In addition, Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura polycondensation and olefin metathesis polymerization produced main&#8208; and side&#8208;chain polymers, respectively. The resultant polymers showed different emission behaviors such as aggregation caused quenching and aggregation induced emission enhancement.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Guide to Directing Group Removal: 8&#8208;Aminoquinoline</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of directing groups allows high levels of selectivity to be achieved in transition&#8208;metal catalyzed transformations. Efficient removal of these auxiliaries after successful functionalization, however, can be very challenging. This review provides a critical overview of strategies used for removal of Daugulis&#8217; 8&#8208;aminoquinoline (2005&#8211;2020), one of the most widely used N,N &#8209;bidentate directing groups. The limitations of these strategies are discussed and alternative approaches are suggested for challenging substrates. Our aim is to provide a comprehensive end&#8208;users&#8217; guide for chemists in academia and industry who want to harness the synthetic power of directing groups&#8212;and be able to remove them from their final products.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The synthesis, electronic structure, and reactivity of a uranium metallacyclopropene were comprehensively studied. Addition of diphenylacetylene (PhC&#8801;CPh) to the uranium phosphinidene metallocene [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U=P&#8208;2,4,6&#8208; t Bu3C6H2 (1) yields the stable uranium metallacyclopropene, [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U[&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2] (2). Based on density functional theory (DFT) results the 5f orbital contributions to the bonding within the metallacyclopropene U&#8208;(&#951;2&#8208;C=C) moiety increases significantly compared to the related Th(IV) compound [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2Th[&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2], which also results in more covalent bonds between the [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U2+ and [&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2]2&#8208; fragments. Therefore, although the thorium and uranium complexes are structurally closely related, different reaction patterns are observed. For example, 2 reacts as a masked synthon for the low&#8208;valent uranium(II) metallocene [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U(II) when reacted with Ph2E2 (E = S, Se), alkynes and a variety of hetero&#8208;unsaturated molecules such as imines, ketazine, bipy, nitriles, organic azides, and azo derivatives. In contrast, five&#8208;membered metallaheterocycles are accessible when 2 is treated with isothiocyanate, aldehydes, and ketones.</dc:description>

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Like Phase of N,N&#8208;Dimethylpyrrolidinium Iodide Impregnated into COFs Endows Fast Lithium Ion Conduction in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solid&#8208;state lithium electrolyte was fabricated by impregnating N,N&#8208;dimethylpyrrolidinium iodide (P1,1I) into the pores of covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The liquid&#8208;like phase of confined P1,1I in combination with the ordered nanochannels of COFs result in remarkable lithium ion conductivity and good cycling performance.







Abstract
A novel kind of solid&#8208;state lithium electrolyte was fabricated by impregnating organic ionic plastic crystals (OIPCs) into the pores of covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The liquid&#8208;like phase of confined N,N&#8208;dimethylpyrrolidinium iodide (P1,1I) and the ordered nanochannels of COFs simultaneously stimulated the lithium ion conduction.

         <title>Catalytic performance of Zr&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks Zr&#8208;abtc and MIP&#8208;200 in selective oxidations with H2O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic performance of Zr&#8208;abtc and MIP&#8208;200 metal&#8208;organic frameworks consisted of 8&#8208;connected Zr  6  &#8208;clusters and tetratopic linkers was investigated in H  2  O  2  &#8208;based selective oxidations and compared with that of 12&#8208;coordinated UiO&#8208;66 and UiO&#8208;67. Zr&#8208;abtc demonstrated advantages in both substrate conversion and product selectivity for epoxidation of electron&#8208;deficient C=C bonds in &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. A significant predomination of 1,2&#8208;epoxide in carvone epoxidation, coupled to high sulfone selectivity in thioether oxidation, points to a nucleophilic oxidation mechanism over Zr&#8208;abtc. The superior catalytic performance in the epoxidation of unsaturated ketones correlates with a larger amount of weak basic sites in Zr&#8208;abtc. Electrophilic activation of H  2  O  2  can also be realized, as evidenced by high activity of Zr&#8208;abtc in epoxidation of electron&#8208;rich C=C bond in caryophyllene. XRD and FTIR studies confirmed the retention of the Zr&#8208;abtc structure after the catalysis. Low activity of MIP&#8208;200 in H  2  O  2  &#8208;based oxidations is most likely related to its specific hydrophilicity, which disfavors adsorption of organic substrates and H  2  O  2  .</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemically Enabled One&#8208;Pot Multistep Synthesis of C19 Androgen Steroids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of many valuable C19 androgens can be accomplished by removal of the C17 side chain from more abundant corticosteroids, followed by further derivatization of the resulting 17&#8208;keto derivative. Conventional chemical reagents pose significant drawbacks for this synthetic strategy, as large amounts of waste are generated, and quenching of the reaction mixture and purification of the 17&#8208;ketosteroid intermediate are typically required. Herein, we present mild, safe and sustainable electrochemical strategies for the preparation of C19 steroids. A reagent and catalyst free protocol for the removal of the C17 side&#8208;chain of corticosteroids via anodic oxidation has been developed, enabling several one&#8208;pot, multistep procedures for the synthesis of androgen steroids. In addition, simultaneous anodic C17 side&#8208;chain cleavage and cathodic catalytic hydrogenation of a steroid has been demonstrated, rendering a convenient and highly atom economic procedure for the synthesis of saturated androgens</dc:description>

However, impaired by tissue auto&#8208;fluorescence that causes low signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR), most fluorescence imaging systems show poor sensitivity to tumors in vivo . In this study, we synthesized organic nanoparticles (ONPs) with persistent luminescence and good biocompatibility for afterglow imaging&#8208;guided PDT. The ONPs displayed near&#8208;infrared light emission with half&#8208;life time at minute level, which offered high SBR and good tissue penetration for in vivo afterglow tumor imaging. Taking advantage of their abundant singlet oxygen generation by NIR laser irradiation guided to the tumor sites, the ONPs also enabled imaging&#8208;guided PDT for efficient suppression of tumor growth in mice with minimal damage to major organs.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;coordinated and Hydrogen Bonded Phenolate Anions as One&#8208;Electron Reducing Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Effect of hydrogen bonding on redox properties: The deprotonation of phenol derivatives with a tetraphosphazene base delivers non&#8208;coordinated phenolates with zinc&#8208;like redox potentials of up to &#8722;0.72(1)&#8197;V vs. SCE, which are capable in radical anion synthesis and SF6 activation. The addition of phenol or water allows for the selective formation of phenolate adducts and enables the study of the effect of hydrogen bonding on phenolate redox properties.







Abstract
In this work, the syntheses of non&#8208;coordinated electron&#8208;rich phenolate anions via deprotonation of the corresponding alcohols with an extremely powerful perethyl tetraphosphazene base (Schwesinger base) are reported. The application of uncharged phosphazenes renders the selective preparation of anionic phenol&#8208;phenolate and phenolate hydrates possible, which allows for the investigation of hydrogen bonding in these species. Hydrogen bonding brings about decreased redox potentials relative to the corresponding non&#8208;coordinated phenolate anions. The latter show redox potentials of up to &#8722;0.72(1)&#8197;V vs. SCE, which is comparable to that of zinc metal, thus qualifying their application as organic zinc mimics. We utilized phenolates as reducing agents for the generation of radical anions in addition to the corresponding phenoxyl radicals. A tetracyanoethylene radical anion salt was synthesized and fully characterized as a representative example. We also present the activation of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) with phenolates in a SET reaction, in which the nature of the respective phenolate determines whether simple fluorides or pentafluorosulfanide ([SF5]&#8722;) salts are formed.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Addition of Diorganozinc Reagents to Pyrazole&#8208;4,5&#8208;Diones and Indoline&#8208;2,3&#8208;Diones</title>

Asymmetric diorganozinc additions to cyclic &#945;&#8208;diketones including pyrazolin&#8208;4,5&#8208;diones and indolin&#8208;2,3&#8208;diones are described. A wide range of highly functionalized chiral tertiary alcohols has been obtained in high to excellent yields with excellent enantioselectivities. The success of this strategy relies on the multiple coordination of zinc aminoalkoxide species to cyclic &#945;&#8208;diketones which contain two carbonyl groups.







Abstract
The catalytic enantioselective diorganozinc additions to cyclic diketones including pyrazolin&#8208;4,5&#8208;diones and isatins have been developed. In the presence of morpholine&#8208;containing chiral amino alcohol ligand, the corresponding chiral cyclic tertiary alcohols were produced in good to excellent yields (up to 97&#8201;%) and enantioselectivities (up to 95&#8201;% ee). The notable feature of this protocol includes its mild reaction conditions, Lewis acid additives free and broad functional group tolerance.

         <title>Guided Antitumoural Drugs: (Imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene)(L)gold(I) Complexes Seeking Cellular Targets Controlled by the Nature of Ligand L</title>

Striking gold: Through the choice of their secondary ligand L, a series of [4,5&#8208;diarylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene](L)gold(I) complexes targeted different cancer cell organelles (nuclei, mitochondria or lysosomes) where they interfered beneficially with molecular targets, such as DNA, thioredoxin reductase, or lysosomal membranes, to elicit p53&#8208;independent apoptosis. Such guided metallodrugs will help to minimise unwanted side effects by addressing limited arrays of targets.







Abstract
Three [1,3&#8208;diethyl&#8208;4&#8208;(p&#8208;methoxyphenyl)&#8208;5&#8208;(3,4,5&#8208;trimethoxyphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene](L)gold(I) complexes, 4&#8201;a (L=Cl), 5&#8201;a (L=PPh3), and 6&#8201;a (L=same N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)), and their fluorescent [4&#8208;(anthracen&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;diethyl&#8208;5&#8208;phenylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene](L)gold(I) analogues, 4&#8201;b, 5&#8201;b, and 6&#8201;b, respectively, were studied for their localisation and effects in cancer cells. Despite their identical NHC ligands, the last three accumulated in different compartments of melanoma cells, namely, the nucleus (4&#8201;b), mitochondria (5&#8201;b), or lysosomes (6&#8201;b). Ligand L was also more decisive for the site of accumulation than the NHC ligand because the couples 4&#8201;a/4&#8201;b, 5&#8201;a/5&#8201;b, and 6&#8201;a/6&#8201;b, carrying different NHC ligands, afforded similar results in cytotoxicity tests, and tests on targets typically found at their sites of accumulation, such as DNA in nuclei, reactive oxygen species and thioredoxin reductase in mitochondria, and lysosomal membranes. Regardless of the site of accumulation, cancer cell apoptosis was eventually induced. The concept of guiding a bioactive complex fragment to a particular subcellular target by secondary ligand L could reduce unwanted side effects.

         <title>A Robust Mesoporous Al2O3&#8208;Based Nanocomposite Catalyst for Abundant NOx Storage with Rational Design of Pt and Ba Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Storing NOx: A rational example for the preparation of a nanocomposite catalyst showing improved NOx storage properties and originating from Ba species is demonstrated through the use of a well&#8208;designed mesoporous alumina (Al2O3) support. Impregnation of Ba species can be completed successfully with retention of the mesoporous structure only after full crystallization of the Al2O3 framework to its &#947;&#8208;phase with the formation of Pt nanoparticles inside the Al2O3 particles.







Abstract
The nanostructural design of heterogeneous catalysts has often been demanded for assessing synergetic effects, which should be developed further by using high&#8208;surface&#8208;area porous metal oxide supports. However, such opportunities have been undermined by the poor stability of ordered mesoporous structures. Herein, rational design is demonstrated to obtain nanocomposite catalysts showing improved NOx storage properties owing to the presence of Ba species over a well&#8208;designed mesoporous alumina (Al2O3) support. It is found that Ba species are impregnated successfully only after the stabilization of the mesoporous structure by full crystallization of Al2O3 frameworks to the &#947;&#8208;phase, with the formation of Pt nanoparticles coinciding with complete removal of organic components. All the insights during this synthetic procedure are essential for designing high&#8208;performance catalysts to purify and recover NOx molecules, and are applied for designing a variety of cutting&#8208;edge mesoporous nanocomposite catalysts.

         <title>Quantification of Noncovalent Interactions in Azide&#8211;Pnictogen, &#8211;Chalcogen, and &#8211;Halogen Contacts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interactions that bind: The noncovalent interactions between azides and oxygen&#8208;containing moieties are investigated through a computational study based on experimental findings. A set of 44 high&#8208;quality, gas&#8208;phase computational model systems with intermolecular azide&#8211;pnictogen, &#8211;chalcogen, and &#8211;halogen contacts are compiled and investigated through semiempirical quantum mechanical methods, density functional approximations, and wave function theory.







Abstract
The noncovalent interactions between azides and oxygen&#8208;containing moieties are investigated through a computational study based on experimental findings. The targeted synthesis of organic compounds with close intramolecular azide&#8211;oxygen contacts yielded six new representatives, for which X&#8208;ray structures were determined. Two of those compounds were investigated with respect to their potential conformations in the gas phase and a possible significantly shorter azide&#8211;oxygen contact. Furthermore, a set of 44 high&#8208;quality, gas&#8208;phase computational model systems with intermolecular azide&#8211;pnictogen (N, P, As, Sb), &#8211;chalcogen (O, S, Se, Te), and &#8211;halogen (F, Cl, Br, I) contacts are compiled and investigated through semiempirical quantum mechanical methods, density functional approximations, and wave function theory. A local energy decomposition (LED) analysis is applied to study the nature of the noncovalent interaction. The special role of electrostatic and London dispersion interactions is discussed in detail. London dispersion is identified as a dominant factor of the azide&#8211;donor interaction with mean London dispersion energy&#8208;interaction energy ratios of 1.3. Electrostatic contributions enhance the azide&#8211;donor coordination motif. The association energies range from &#8722;1.00 to &#8722;5.5&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1.

         <title>Combined Dynamic Kinetic Resolution and C&#8722;H Functionalization for Facile Synthesis of Non&#8208;Biaryl&#8208;Atropisomer&#8208;Type Axially Chiral Organosilanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Powerful DKR: A palladium&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective ortho C&#8722;H olefination/alkynylaton combined with dynamic kinetic resolution strategy is developed to construct axially chiral styrene&#8208;type organosilanes with excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Although asymmetric C&#8722;H functionalization has been available for the synthesis of structurally diverse molecules, catalytic dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) approaches to change racemic stereogenic axes remain synthetic challenges in this field. Here, a concise palladium&#8208;catalyzed DKR was combined with C&#8722;H functionalization involving olefination and alkynylation for the highly efficient synthesis of non&#8208;biaryl&#8208;atropisomer&#8208;type (NBA) axially chiral oragnosilanes. The chemistry proceeded through two different and distinct DKR: first, an atroposelective C&#8722;H olefination or alkynylation produced axially chiral vinylsilanes or alkynylsilanes as a new family of non&#8208;biaryl atropisomers (NBA), and second, the extension of this DKR strategy to twofold o,o&#8242;&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization led to the multifunctional axially chiral organosilicon compounds with up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee.

         <title>Deciphering the Chemical Basis of Fluorescence of a Selenium&#8208;Labeled Uracil Probe when Bound at the Bacterial Ribosomal A&#8208;Site</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Cause and effect: The fluorescence of SeU in the context of ribosomal RNA and in the presence of antibiotic paromomycin has been investigated by means of computational methods. Our results explain why the probe does not emit if antibiotics are not present and which factors are the most important to control fluorescence.







Abstract
We unveil in this work the main factors that govern the turn&#8208;on/off fluorescence of a Se&#8208;modified uracil probe at the ribosomal RNA A&#8208;site. Whereas the constraint into an &#8220;in&#8208;plane&#8221; conformation of the two rings of the fluorophore is the main driver for the observed turn&#8208;on fluorescence emission in the presence of the antibiotic paromomycin, the electrostatics of the environment plays a minor role during the emission process. Our computational strategy clearly indicates that, in the absence of paromomycin, the probe prefers conformations that show a dark S1 electronic state with participation of n&#960;* electronic transition contributions between the selenium atom and the &#960;&#8208;system of the uracil moiety.

         <title>C&#8722;N Axial Chiral Hypervalent Iodine Reagents: Catalytic Stereoselective &#945;&#8208;Oxytosylation of Ketones</title>

Novel C&#8208;N axial chiral iodoarenes enable catalytic stereoselective &#945;&#8208;oxytosylations of ketones with high yields and improved enantioselectivities.







Abstract
A simple synthesis of a library of novel C&#8722;N axially chiral iodoarenes is achieved in a three&#8208;step synthesis from commercially available aniline derivatives. C&#8722;N axial chiral iodine reagents are rarely investigated in the hypervalent iodine arena. The potential of the novel chiral iodoarenes as organocatalysts for stereoselective oxidative transformations is assessed using the well explored, but challenging stereoselective &#945;&#8208;oxytosylation of ketones. All investigated reagents catalyse the stereoselective oxidation of propiophenone to the corresponding chiral &#945;&#8208;oxytosylated products with good stereochemical control. Using the optimised reaction conditions a wide range of products was obtained in generally good to excellent yields and with good enantioselectivities.

         <title>Mo2C/Reduced Graphene Oxide Composites with Enhanced Electrocatalytic Activity and Biocompatibility for Microbial Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microbial fuel cells: A unique porous nanocomposite Mo2C/reduced graphene oxide decorated on carbon paper is demonstrated as an advanced multifunction anode for microbial fuel cells. The hierarchical porous structure and rough surface of Mo2C granules are energetically in favor of the formation of 3D hybrid biofilm and thus guarantee an admirable energy conversion efficiency of 13.2&#8201;%, nearly one order of magnitude higher than that of the carbon paper.







Abstract
A simple, cost&#8208;effective strategy was developed to effectively improve the electron transfer efficiency as well as the power output of microbial fuel cells (MFCs) by decorating the commercial carbon paper (CP) anode with an advanced Mo2C/reduced graphene oxide (Mo2C/RGO) composite. Benefiting from the synergistic effects of the superior electrocatalytic activity of Mo2C, the high surface area, and prominent conductivity of RGO, the MFC equipped with this Mo2C/RGO composite yielded a remarkable output power density of 1747&#177;37.6&#8197;mW&#8201;m&#8722;2, which was considerably higher than that of CP&#8208;MFC (926.8&#177;6.3&#8197;mW&#8201;m&#8722;2). Importantly, the composite also facilitated the formation of 3D hybrid biofilm and could effectively improve the bacteria&#8211;electrode interaction. These features resulted in an enhanced coulombic efficiency up 13.2&#8201;%, nearly one order of magnitude higher than that of the CP (1.2&#8201;%).

         <title>Small Figure&#8208;Eight Luminophores: Double&#8208;Twisted Tethered Cyclic Binaphthyls Boost Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of figure&#8208;eight&#8208;shaped cyclic naphthalenes with different tethers were synthesized, and their CPL properties were investigated. Compounds with short tether showed remarkable boosting of the glum (0.010&#8211;0.016). The proximate figure&#8208;eight luminophore promotes elongation of the magnetic transition dipole moment that results in significant increases in glum.







Abstract
Double&#8208;twisted cyclic binaphthyls, in which two naphthalenes are tethered by &#8208;O(CH2)nO&#8208; linkage (n=1&#8211;3), have been synthesized. X&#8208;ray analyses and DFT calculations revealed a tightly constrained stereogenic figure&#8208;eight geometry. Tethering of two naphthalenes by short linkage forces a small dihedral angle, and the cyclic binaphthyls with short tether (n=1, 2) exhibit remarkable boosting of the glum value (1.0&#8211;1.6&#215;10&#8722;2) in circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and unusual glum/gabs ratios (0.93&#8211;1.3). These experimental high |glum| values are in accord with the results of excited state TD&#8208;DFT calculations, which show transannular interactions and that consequent extensive delocalization occurs throughout the figure&#8208;eight &#960;&#8208;core. As a result, the present figure&#8208;eight luminophore promote the elongation of the magnetic transition dipole moment that results in significant increases in glum values.

         <title>Carbon Origami via an Alumina&#8208;Assisted Cyclodehydrofluorination Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational folding of nanographenes has the potential to penetrate the barrier between macro&#8208; and micro&#8208;worlds for the engineering of carbon&#8208;based materials with functional molecular shapes. This work reports that an alumina&#8208;mediated C&#8722;F bond activation strategy is able to tackle this challenge allowing both the effective incorporation of non&#8208;hexagonal rings and the formation of helical structures leading to the folding of nanographenes akin to origami. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K. Amsharov et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202003448).

         <title>Intermolecular Hydroaminoalkylation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Allylic amines are directly formed from secondary amines and alkynes in the presence of highly active titanium catalysts. The corresponding hydroaminoalkylation reactions, which take place by C&#8722;H bond activation at sp3&#8208;centers in the &#945;&#8208;position to a nitrogen atom, can be achieved with internal and terminal alkynes, and best results are obtained with N&#8208;benzylaniline derivatives.







Abstract
Intermolecular hydroaminoalkylation reactions of alkynes with secondary amines, which selectively give access to allylic amines with E configuration of the alkene unit, are achieved in the presence of titanium catalysts. Successful reactions of symmetrically substituted diaryl&#8208; and dialkylalkynes as well as a terminal alkyne take place with N&#8208;benzylanilines, N&#8208;alkylanilines, and N&#8208;alkylbenzylamines.

         <title>Zinc Oxide Defect Microstructure and Surface Chemistry Derived from Oxidation of Metallic Zinc: Thin&#8208;Film Transistor and Sensor Behavior of ZnO Films and Rods</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Detection of combined defect cluster sites in zinc oxide: Oxidation of plasma sputtered zinc generates zinc oxide films in which Doppler broadening positron annihilation spectroscopy (PAS) and positron annihilation life&#8208;time studies (PALS) make it possible to detect oxygen vacancies (Vo) that are in close proximity to zinc vacancies (VZn). They form defect cluster sites acting as shallow acceptors reducing the overall electron conductivity. PAS and PALS is able to correlate semiconducting behavior and microstructure in ZnO thin film transistors. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J.&#8197;J. Schneider et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202004270).

         <title>Mononuclear Dysprosium Alkoxide and Aryloxide Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent studies have shown that mononuclear lanthanide (Ln) complexes can be high&#8208;performing single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs). Recently, there has been an influx of mononuclear Ln alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs, which have provided the necessary geometrical control to improve SMM properties and to allow the intricate relaxation dynamics of Ln SMMs to be studied in detail. Here we review non&#8208;aqueous Ln alkoxide and aryloxide chemistry applied to the synthesis of low&#8208;coordinate mononuclear Ln SMMs. We focus on mononuclear Dy(III) alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs with coordination numbers up to eight, covering synthesis, solid state structures and magnetic attributes. Brief overviews are also provided of mononuclear Dy(III) siloxide SMMs as heavier analogues, and complementary Tb(III), Ho(III), Er(III) and Yb(III) alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs.</dc:description>

         <title>Isoselective Polymerization of rac&#8208;Lactide by Aluminum Complexes of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Phosphinidene Adducts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;phosphinidene adducts (NHC)PH were reacted with AlMe3 in toluene to afford the monoaluminum complexes [{(IDipp)PH}AlMe3] and [{(IMes)PH}AlMe3] (IDipp = 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene, IMes = 1,3&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene). In contrast, the dialuminum complex [{(MeIMes)PH}(AlMe3)2] was obtained for MeIMes = 1,3&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethylimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene. These complexes served as initiators for the efficient ring&#8208;opening polymerization of rac&#8208;lactide in toluene at 60 &#176;C. High degrees of isoselectivity were found for the poly(rac&#8208;lactide) obtained in the presence of the monoaluminum complexes (Pm up to 0.92, Tm up to 191 &#176;C), whereas almost atactic polymers were produced by the dialuminum complex. Detailed mechanistic studies reveal that the polymerization proceeds via a coordination&#8208;insertion mechanism with the carbene&#8208;phosphinidene ligands acting as stereodirecting groups.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of the &#8211;OH Groups within Mn12 Clusters in Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formidable reactivity of the oxygen&#8208;evolving center near photosystem II is largely based on its protein environment that stabilizes it during catalysis. Inspired by this concept, we developed the water&#8208;soluble  Mn  12  clusters Mn  12  O  12  (O  2  CC  6  H  3  (OH)  2  )  16  (H  2  O)  4  (&#8220;3,5DHMn  12  &#8221;) and Mn  12  O  12  (O  2  CC  6  H  3  (OH)  3  )  16  (H  2  O)  4  (&#8220;3,4,5THMn  12  &#8221;) as efficient electrocatalysts for water oxidation. Herein we explore the role of the &#8211;OH groups in the electrocatalytic process by describing the structural and electrocatalytic properties of two new  Mn  12  clusters,  3,4DHMn  12  and  2,3DHMn  12  , having one &#8211;OH group in the  meta  position relative to the benzoate&#8208;Mn moiety, and one at the  para  or  ortho  position, respectively. We discovered that the Mn centers in  3,4DHMn  12  have lower oxidation potential compared with those in  2,3DHMn  12  , and thus,  3,4DHMn  12  can catalyze water oxidation with higher rate and TON than  2,3DHMn  12  . Hence, we could establish the role of the &#8211;OH groups in the electrocatalysis, being involved in electronic stabilization of the Mn centers or in proton shuttling.</dc:description>

         <title>Co&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Intramolecular [3+2] Cycloaddition of Yne&#8208;Alkylidenecyclopropanes and Reaction Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing new transition&#8208;metal catalyzed asymmetric cycloadditions for the synthesis of five&#8208;membered carbocycles (FMCs) is a research frontier in reaction development, due to the ubiquitous presence of chiral FMCs in various functional molecules. Reported here is our discovery of a highly enantioselective intramolecular [3+2] cycloaddition of yne&#8208; alkylidenecyclopropanes (yne&#8208;ACPs) to both bicyclo[3.3.0]octa&#8208;dienes and bicyclo[4.3.0]nonadienes molecules, by using cheap Co catalyst and commercially available chiral ligand (S)&#8208;Xyl&#8208;BINAP. This reaction avoids the use of precious Pd and Rh catalysts which are usually the choices for ACPs&#8217; [3+2] reactions. The ee values in the present reaction can be up to 92%. Cationic cobalt (I) species was suggested by experiments as the catalytic species. DFT calculations showed that this [3+2] reaction starts with oxidative cyclometallation of alkyne and ACP, followed by ring opening of the cyclopropyl (CP) group and reductive elimination to form the cycloadduct. This mechanism is different from previous [3+2] reactions of ACPs, which usually start from CP cleavage, not from oxidative cyclization.</dc:description>

         <title>Designed construction of SrTiO3/SrSO4/Pt heterojunction with boosted photocatalytic H2 evolution activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient separation of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs is a crucial factor for high&#8208;performance photocatalysts. Effective electron&#8208;hole separation and immigration could be achieved by heterojunctions with suitable band structures. Herein, a porous SrTiO  3  /SrSO  4  heterojunction is prepared by a sol&#8208;gel method at room temperature followed by an annealing process. XRD characterization suggests high crystallinity of the heterostructure. A well&#8208;defined interface between the two phases is confirmed by HRTEM. The photocatalytic H  2  evolution productivity of SrTiO  3  /SrSO  4  heterojunction with Pt as co&#8208;catalyst reaches 396.82&#956;molg  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  , which is 16 times higher than that of SrTiO  3  /Pt. The boosted photocatalytic activity of SrTiO  3  /SrSO  4  /Pt can be ascribed to the presence of SrSO  4  , which promotes the transfer and immigration of photogenerated carriers by forming heterojunction and the porous structure, which provides a large amounts of active sites. This novel porous heterostructure brings new ideas for the development of high&#8208;efficiency photocatalysts for H  2  release.</dc:description>

Predictable outcomes: Control of stereoselectivity during the glycosylation reaction is the main challenge of synthetic chemistry because the reaction can generate both &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;glycosides. Recent mechanistic studies that have applied statistical analysis and quantitation for defining stereoselective changes during the reaction process are discussed.







Abstract
Chemical synthesis is one of the practical approaches to access carbohydrate&#8208;based natural products and their derivatives with high quality and in a large quantity. However, stereoselectivity during the glycosylation reaction is the main challenge because the reaction can generate both &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;glycosides. The main focus of the present article is the concept of recent mechanistic studies that have applied statistical analysis and quantitation for defining stereoselective changes during the reaction process. Based on experimental evidence, a detailed discussion associated with the mechanism and degree of influence affecting the stereoselective outcome of glycosylation is included.

         <title>Synthesis of Asparagine Derivatives Harboring a Lewis X Type DC&#8208;SIGN Ligand and Evaluation of their Impact on Immunomodulation in Multiple Sclerosis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 8, Page 2742-2752, February 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Immunomodulation. A novel asparagine solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis building block harboring a Lewis X type DC&#8208;SIGN ligand has been synthesized (see scheme) and incorporated into the immunodominant portion of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG31&#8208;55). This glycopeptide was evaluated for its ability to inhibit citrullination&#8208;induced aggregation of MOG35&#8208;55, to bind to DC&#8208;SIGN in vitro and for its immunomodulatory effects on human dendritic cells, with the Lewis X yielding a tolerogenic response.







Abstract
The protein myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) is a key component of myelin and an autoantigen in the disease multiple sclerosis (MS). Post&#8208;translational N&#8208;glycosylation of Asn31 of MOG seems to play a key role in modulating the immune response towards myelin. This is mediated by the interaction of Lewis&#8208;type glycan structures in the N&#8208;glycan of MOG with the DC&#8208;SIGN receptor on dendritic cells (DCs). Here, we report the synthesis of an unnatural Lewis X (LeX)&#8208;containing Fmoc&#8208;SPPS&#8208;compatible asparagine building block (SPPS=solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis), as well as asparagine building blocks containing two LeX&#8208;derived oligosaccharides: LacNAc and Fuc&#945;1&#8208;3GlcNAc. These building blocks were used for the glycosylation of the immunodominant portion of MOG (MOG31&#8208;55) and analyzed with respect to their ability to bind to DC&#8208;SIGN in different biological setups, as well as their ability to inhibit the citrullination&#8208;induced aggregation of MOG31&#8208;55.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Immunomodulation&lt;/b&gt;. A novel asparagine solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis building block harboring a Lewis X type DC&#8208;SIGN ligand has been synthesized (see scheme) and incorporated into the immunodominant portion of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG&lt;sub&gt;31&#8208;55&lt;/sub&gt;). This glycopeptide was evaluated for its ability to inhibit citrullination&#8208;induced aggregation of MOG&lt;sub&gt;35&#8208;55&lt;/sub&gt;, to bind to DC&#8208;SIGN in vitro and for its immunomodulatory effects on human dendritic cells, with the Lewis X yielding a tolerogenic response.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protein myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) is a key component of myelin and an autoantigen in the disease multiple sclerosis (MS). Post&#8208;translational &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;glycosylation of Asn&lt;sub&gt;31&lt;/sub&gt; of MOG seems to play a key role in modulating the immune response towards myelin. This is mediated by the interaction of Lewis&#8208;type glycan structures in the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;glycan of MOG with the DC&#8208;SIGN receptor on dendritic cells (DCs). Here, we report the synthesis of an unnatural Lewis X (Le&lt;sup&gt;X&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8208;containing Fmoc&#8208;SPPS&#8208;compatible asparagine building block (SPPS=solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis), as well as asparagine building blocks containing two Le&lt;sup&gt;X&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;derived oligosaccharides: LacNAc and Fuc&#945;1&#8208;3GlcNAc. These building blocks were used for the glycosylation of the immunodominant portion of MOG (MOG&lt;sub&gt;31&#8208;55&lt;/sub&gt;) and analyzed with respect to their ability to bind to DC&#8208;SIGN in different biological setups, as well as their ability to inhibit the citrullination&#8208;induced aggregation of MOG&lt;sub&gt;31&#8208;55&lt;/sub&gt;. Finally, a cytokine secretion assay was carried out on human monocyte&#8208;derived DCs, which showed the ability of the neoglycopeptide decorated with a single Le&lt;sup&gt;X&lt;/sup&gt; to alter the balance of pro&#8208; and anti&#8208;inflammatory cytokines, inducing a tolerogenic response.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A pH&#8208;Induced Reversible Conformational Switch Able to Control the Photocurrent Efficiency in a Peptide Supramolecular System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 8, Page 2810-2817, February 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular peptide&#8208;based bio&#8208;inspired systems have been built on gold surface. The effect of pH on the peptide conformation and on the ability of the film to generate photocurrent was investigated. In particular, at low pH, the photon to current conversion efficiency obtained is the highest value recorded so far with biomolecular systems.







Abstract
External stimuli are potent tools that Nature uses to control protein function and activity. For instance, during viral entry and exit, pH variations are known to trigger large protein conformational changes. In Nature, also the electron transfer (ET) properties of ET proteins are influenced by pH&#8208;induced conformational changes. In this work, a pH&#8208;controlled, reversible 310&#8208;helix to &#945;&#8208;helix conversion (from acidic to highly basic pH values and vice versa) of a peptide supramolecular system built on a gold surface is described. The effect of pH on the ability of the peptide SAM to generate a photocurrent was investigated, with particular focus on the effect of the pH&#8208;induced conformational change on photocurrent efficiency. The films were characterized by electrochemical and spectroscopic techniques, and were found to be very stable over time, also in contact with a solution. They were also able to generate current under illumination, with an efficiency that is the highest recorded so far with biomolecular systems.

         <title>Water Formation in Non&#8208;Hydrolytic Sol&#8211;Gel Routes: Selective Synthesis of Tetragonal and Monoclinic Mesoporous Zirconia as a Case Study</title>

Water in non&#8208;hydrolytic sol&#8211;gel: Monitoring in situ water formation in non&#8208;hydrolytic sol&#8211;gel routes to mesoporous zirconia shows that it impacts not only the mechanism of the sol&#8211;gel process but also the structure of the final material.







Abstract
Several non&#8208;hydrolytic sol&#8211;gel syntheses involving different precursors, oxygen donors, and conditions have been screened aiming to selectively produce mesoporous t&#8208;ZrO2 or m&#8208;ZrO2 with significant specific surface areas. The in situ water formation was systematically investigated by Karl Fisher titration of the syneresis liquids. XRD and nitrogen physisorption were employed to characterize the structure and texture of the ZrO2 samples. Significant amounts of water were found in several cases, notably in the reactions of Zr(OnPr)4 with ketones (acetone, 2&#8208;pentanone, acetophenone), and of ZrCl4 with alcohols (benzyl alcohol, ethanol) or acetone. Conversely, the reactions of Zr(OnPr)4 with acetic anhydride or benzyl alcohol at moderate temperature (200&#8201;&#176;C) and of ZrCl4 with diisopropyl ether appear strictly non&#8208;hydrolytic. Although reaction time and reaction temperature were also important parameters, the presence of water played a crucial role on the structure of the final zirconia: t&#8208;ZrO2 is favored in strictly non&#8208;hydrolytic routes, while m&#8208;ZrO2 is favored in the presence of significant amounts of water. 1H and 13C&#8197;NMR analysis of the syneresis liquids allowed us to identify the main reactions responsible for the formation of water and of the oxide network. The morphology of the most interesting ZrO2 samples was further investigated by electron microscopy (SEM, TEM).

         <title>Iron Coordination Properties of Gramibactin as Model for the New Class of Diazeniumdiolate Based Siderophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 8, Page 2724-2733, February 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sequestration properties of gramibactin as a prototype for the new class of diazeniumdiolate siderophores is presented and compared with siderophores derived from catecholates and hydroxamates. According to pFe and pL0.5 values, gramibactin is a considerably more potent sequestering agent than the known class of phytosiderophores and approximately reaches the ability of typical hydroxamates like desferrioxamines.







Abstract
Gramibactin (GBT) is an archetype for the new class of diazeniumdiolate siderophores, produced by Paraburkholderia graminis, a cereal&#8208;associated rhizosphere bacterium, for which a detailed solution thermodynamic study exploring the iron coordination properties is reported. The acid&#8208;base behavior of gramibactin as well as its complexing ability toward Fe3+ was studied over a wide range of pH values (2&#8804;pH&#8804;11). For the latter the ligand&#8208;competition method employing EDTA was used. Only two species are formed: [Fe(GBT)]&#8722; (pH&#8197;2 to 9) and [Fe(GBT)(OH)2]3&#8722; (pH&#8805;9). The formation of [Fe(GBT)]&#8722; and its occurrence in real systems was confirmed by LC&#8208;HRESIMS analysis of the bacteria culture broth extract. The sequestering ability of gramibactin was also evaluated in terms of the parameters pFe and pL0.5. Gramibactin exhibits a higher sequestering ability toward Fe3+ than EDTA and of the same order of magnitude as hydroxamate&#8208;type microbial siderophores, but smaller than most of the catecholate&#8208;type siderophores and much higher than the most known phytosiderophores.

         <title>CompassR Yields Highly Organic&#8208;Solvent&#8208;Tolerant Enzymes through Recombination of Compatible Substitutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 8, Page 2789-2797, February 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smarter variation: Two recombination strategies, the two&#8208;gene recombination process (2GenReP) and the in silico guided recombination process (InSiReP), employing the CompassR (computer&#8208;assisted recombination) rule are used as guides to obtain highly improved variants from huge protein sequence space.







Abstract
The CompassR (computer&#8208;assisted recombination) rule enables, among beneficial substitutions, the identification of those that can be recombined in directed evolution. Herein, a recombination strategy is systematically investigated to minimize experimental efforts and maximize possible improvements. In total, 15 beneficial substitutions from Bacillus subtilis lipase&#8197;A (BSLA), which improves resistance to the organic cosolvent 1,4&#8208;dioxane (DOX), were studied to compare two recombination strategies, the two&#8208;gene recombination process (2GenReP) and the in silico guided recombination process (InSiReP), employing CompassR. Remarkably, both strategies yielded a highly DOX&#8208;resistant variant, M4 (I12R/Y49R/E65H/N98R/K122E/L124K), with up to 14.6&#8208;fold improvement after screening of about 270 clones. M4 has a remarkably enhanced resistance in 60&#8201;% (v/v) acetone (6.0&#8208;fold), 30&#8201;% (v/v) ethanol (2.1&#8208;fold), and 60&#8201;% (v/v) methanol (2.4&#8208;fold) compared with wild&#8208;type BSLA. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that attracting water molecules by charged surface substitutions is the main driver for increasing the DOX resistance of BSLA M4. Both strategies and obtained molecular knowledge can likely be used to improve the properties of other enzymes with a similar &#945;/&#946;&#8208;hydrolase fold.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Smarter variation&lt;/b&gt;: Two recombination strategies, the two&#8208;gene recombination process (2GenReP) and the &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; guided recombination process (InSiReP), employing the CompassR (computer&#8208;assisted recombination) rule are used as guides to obtain highly improved variants from huge protein sequence space.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CompassR (computer&#8208;assisted recombination) rule enables, among beneficial substitutions, the identification of those that can be recombined in directed evolution. Herein, a recombination strategy is systematically investigated to minimize experimental efforts and maximize possible improvements. In total, 15 beneficial substitutions from &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt; lipase&#8197;A (BSLA), which improves resistance to the organic cosolvent 1,4&#8208;dioxane (DOX), were studied to compare two recombination strategies, the two&#8208;gene recombination process (2GenReP) and the &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; guided recombination process (InSiReP), employing CompassR. Remarkably, both strategies yielded a highly DOX&#8208;resistant variant, M4 (I12R/Y49R/E65H/N98R/K122E/L124K), with up to 14.6&#8208;fold improvement after screening of about 270 clones. M4 has a remarkably enhanced resistance in 60&#8201;% (v/v) acetone (6.0&#8208;fold), 30&#8201;% (v/v) ethanol (2.1&#8208;fold), and 60&#8201;% (v/v) methanol (2.4&#8208;fold) compared with wild&#8208;type BSLA. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that attracting water molecules by charged surface substitutions is the main driver for increasing the DOX resistance of BSLA M4. Both strategies and obtained molecular knowledge can likely be used to improve the properties of other enzymes with a similar &#945;/&#946;&#8208;hydrolase fold.&lt;/p&gt;

The dynamic equilibria of organomagnesium reagents are known to be very complex, and the relative reactivity of their components is poorly understood. Herein, a combination of DFT calculations and kinetic experiments is employed to investigate the detailed reaction mechanism of the Pummerer coupling between sulfoxides and turbo&#8208;organomagnesium amides.







Abstract
The dynamic equilibria of organomagnesium reagents are known to be very complex, and the relative reactivity of their components is poorly understood. Herein, a combination of DFT calculations and kinetic experiments is employed to investigate the detailed reaction mechanism of the Pummerer coupling between sulfoxides and turbo&#8208;organomagnesium amides. Among the various aggregates studied, unprecedented heterometallic open cubane structures are demonstrated to yield favorable barriers through a concerted anion&#8208;anion coupling/ S&#8722;O cleavage step. Beyond a structural curiosity, these results introduce open cubane organometallics as key reactive intermediates in turbo&#8208;organomagnesium amide mixtures.

To design low&#8208;flammable NMR/MRI inhalable contrast agents with the parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization technique, results were derived from kinetic, polarization, and relaxation measurements for a number of functionalized hydrocarbons with various degrees of fluorine substitution.







Abstract
Many MRI contrast agents formed with the parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization (PHIP) technique exhibit biocompatible profiles. In the context of respiratory imaging with inhalable molecular contrast agents, the development of nonflammable contrast agents would nonetheless be highly beneficial for the biomedical translation of this sensitive, high&#8208;throughput and affordable hyperpolarization technique. To this end, we assess the hydrogenation kinetics, the polarization levels and the lifetimes of PHIP hyperpolarized products (acids, ethers and esters) at various degrees of fluorine substitution. The results highlight important trends as a function of molecular structure that are instrumental for the design of new, safe contrast agents for in vivo imaging applications of the PHIP technique, with an emphasis on the highly volatile group of ethers used as inhalable anesthetics.

         <title>Synergetic Effect of Mo6 Clusters and Gold Nanoparticles on the Photophysical Properties of Both Components</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 8, Page 2818-2825, February 5, 2021. </description>

PDT and PTT: Hybrid materials containing Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) and Mo6 clusters as photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT) agents, respectively, in a silica core&#8211;shell system show significant enhancement of the photophysical properties of both components: brighter phosphorescence, higher efficiency of singlet&#8208;oxygen generation, and more pronounced surface plasmon resonance (SPR).







Abstract
Photodynamic and photothermal therapies (PDT, and PTT, respectively) are promising candidates for multimodal anticancer therapies (i.e., combinations of therapies), since their action is based on mechanisms that generally cannot be resisted by cancer cells, that is, generation of highly oxidizing oxygen species and high temperature, respectively. Herein, hybrid materials that combine octahedral molybdenum clusters as potential PDT agents and plasmonic spherical gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as PTT agents are reported. Partial overlap of the photoemission spectrum of the cluster and the surface plasmon resonance band of the AuNPs facilitates energy transfer between the photoactive components, which resulted in synergetic enhancement of their photophysical properties. Specifically, by careful selection of the spacing between the cluster and the gold nanoparticle, a significant increase in luminescence and photosensitizing properties of the cluster was achieved in comparison with similar, but gold&#8208;free, particles. On the other hand, the cluster complex facilitated energy conversion to heat by gold particles and hence increased the heating rate under laser irradiation.

Abstract
This work reports the preparation of unique hierarchical yolk/double&#8208;shelled SiOx@TiO2@C nanospheres with different voids by a facile sol&#8208;gel method combined with carbon coating. In the preparation process, SiOx nanosphere is used as a hard template. Etch time of SiOx yolk affects the morphology and electrochemical performance of SiOx@TiO2@C. With the increase in etch time, the yolk/double&#8208;shelled SiOx@TiO2@C with 15 and 30&#8197;nm voids and the TiO2@C hollow nanospheres are obtained. The yolk/double&#8208;shelled SiOx@TiO2@C nanospheres exhibit remarkable lithium&#8208;ion battery performance as anodes, including high lithium storage capacity, outstanding rate capability, good reversibility, and stable long&#8208;term cycle life. The unique structure can accommodate the large volume change of the SiOx yolk, provide a unique buffering space for the discharge/charge processes, improve the structural stability of the electrode material during repeated Li+ intercalation/deintercalation processes, and enhance the cycling stability. The SiOx@TiO2@C with 30&#8197;nm void space exhibits a high discharge specific capacity of &#8776;1195.4&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at the current density of 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 300&#8197;cycles and &#8776;701.1&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 for over 800 cycles. These results suggest that the proposed particle architecture is promising and may have potential applications in improving various high performance anode materials.

         <title>A Carboxyl&#8208;Functionalized Covalent Organic Framework Synthesized in a Deep Eutectic Solvent for Dye Adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 8, Page 2692-2698, February 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Waste not: A deep eutectic solvent has been used as a green solvent for the first time to synthesize a new carboxyl&#8208;functionalized covalent organic framework, TpPa&#8208;COOH, under environmental pressure. The as&#8208;synthesized TpPa&#8208;COOH exhibited good crystallinity, with ordered, open channels. Significantly, its high adsorption capacity could be used to remove cationic organic dyes from wastewater.







Abstract
Instead of using organic solvents, a deep eutectic solvent (DES) composed of tetrabutylammonium bromide and imidazole (Bu4NBr/Im) was employed as a solvent for the first time to synthesize covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Due to the low vapor pressure of the Bu4NBr/Im&#8208;based DES, a new carboxyl&#8208;functionalized COF (TpPa&#8208;COOH) was synthesized under environmental pressure. The as&#8208;synthesized TpPa&#8208;COOH has open channels, and the DES can be removed completely from the pores. The dye adsorption performance of TpPa&#8208;COOH was examined for three organic dyes with similar molecular sizes: one anionic dye (eosin&#8197;B, EB) and two cationic dyes (methylene blue, MB and safranine&#8197;T, ST). TpPa&#8208;COOH showed an excellent selective adsorption effect on MB and ST. The electronegative keto form in TpPa&#8208;COOH might help to form electrostatic and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions between the &#960;&#8208;stacking frameworks of TpPa&#8208;COOH and the positive plane MB and ST molecules. The adsorption isotherms of MB and ST on TpPa&#8208;COOH were further investigated in detail, and the equilibrium adsorption was well modeled by using a Langmuir isotherm model. Together with hydrogen bonding, TpPa&#8208;COOH showed higher adsorption capacity for ST than for MB (1135 vs. 410&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1). These results could provide a guidance for the green synthesis of adsorbents in removing organic dyes from wastewater.

         <title>Pyrene&#8208;Terminated Tin Sulfide Clusters: Optical Properties and Deposition on a Metal Surface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 8, Page 2734-2741, February 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A first series of pyrene&#8208;terminated organotin sulfide compounds and unprecedented side products, [(RpyrCl2Sn)2S] (1), (pyren&#8208;1&#8208;ylmethylene)hydrazine (2), 1,2&#8208;bis(pyren&#8208;1&#8208;ylmethylene)hydrazine (3), [(RpyrSn)4S6]&#8901;2&#8201;CH2Cl2 (4), and [(RpyrSn)4Sn2S10] (5), were synthesized. The combination of inorganic Sn/S moieties with the pyrene units affects optical absorption and fluorescence properties as well as the deposition on a metal surface.







Abstract
Herein, we present the synthesis of two pyrene&#8208;functionalized clusters, [(RpyrSn)4S6]&#8901;2&#8201;CH2Cl2 (4) and [(RpyrSn)4Sn2S10]&#8901;n&#8201;CH2Cl2 (n=4, 5&#8201;a; n=2, 5&#8201;b; Rpyr=CMe2CH2C(Me)N&#8208;NC(H)C16H9), both of which form in reactions of the organotin sulfide cluster [(RNSn)4S6] (C; RN=CMe2CH2C(Me)N&#8208;NH2) with the well&#8208;known fluorescent dye 1&#8208;pyrenecarboxaldehyde (B). In contrast, reactions using an organotin sulfide cluster with another core structure, [(RNSn)3S4Cl] (A), leads to formation of small molecular fragments, [(RpyrCl2Sn)2S] (1), (pyren&#8208;1&#8208;ylmethylene)hydrazine (2), and 1,2&#8208;bis(pyren&#8208;1&#8208;ylmethylene)hydrazine (3). Besides synthesis and structures of the new compounds, we report the influence of the inorganic core on the optical properties of the dye, which was analyzed exemplarily for compound&#8197;5&#8201;a via absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. This cluster was also used for exploring the potential of such non&#8208;volatile clusters for deposition on a metal surface under vacuum conditions.

         <title>Breslow Intermediates (Amino Enols) and Their Keto Tautomers: First Gas&#8208;Phase Characterization by IR Ion Spectroscopy</title>

Breslow intermediates in the gas phase: In N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed Umpolung, the reaction of the substrate aldehyde with the NHC gives the Breslow intermediate (BI) as pivotal species. The combination of IR ion spectroscopy with quantum chemical computations can determine whether the BI exists as a nucleophilic amino enol or as its keto tautomer in the gas phase, which is decisive for its reactivity both in enzymatic catalysis and in organocatalysis.







Abstract
Breslow intermediates (BIs) are the crucial nucleophilic amino enol intermediates formed from electrophilic aldehydes in the course of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed umpolung reactions. Both in organocatalytic and enzymatic umpolung, the question whether the Breslow intermediate exists as the nucleophilic enol or in the form of its electrophilic keto tautomer is of utmost importance for its reactivity and function. Herein, the preparation of charge&#8208;tagged Breslow intermediates/keto tautomers derived from three different types of NHCs (imidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenes, 1,2,4&#8208;triazolin&#8208;5&#8208;ylidenes, thiazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenes) and aldehydes is reported. An ammonium charge tag is introduced through the aldehyde unit or the NHC. ESI&#8208;MS IR ion spectroscopy allowed the unambiguous conclusion that in the gas phase, the imidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene&#8208;derived BI indeed exists as a diamino enol, while both 1,2,4&#8208;triazolin&#8208;5&#8208;ylidenes and thiazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenes give the keto tautomer. This result coincides with the tautomeric states observed for the BIs in solution (NMR) and in the crystalline state (XRD), and is in line with our earlier calculations on the energetics of BI keto&#8211;enol equilibria.

Glassy kobold: CoPd nanoalloys are prepared using a metal&#8211;organic framework as a template for both, the N&#8208;doped carbon and cobalt precursors. The catalyst encapsulated in silica shell represents a clean, mild and efficient system for the hydrogenation of nitroarenes and alkenes. Improved activity is achieved due to the synergistic effect between Co and Pd components whereas the improved stability is owed to the protection of the silica shell.







Abstract
In this work, a series of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;derived CoPd nanoalloys have been prepared. The nanocatalysts exhibited excellent activities in the hydrogenation of nitroarenes and alkenes in green solvent (ethanol/water) under mild conditions (H2 balloon, room temperature). Using ZIF&#8208;67 as template for both carbon matrix and cobalt precursor coating with a mesoporous SiO2 layer, the catalyst CoPd/NC@SiO2 was smoothly constructed. Catalytic results revealed a synergistic effect between Co and Pd components in the hydrogenation process due to the enhanced electron density. The mesoporous SiO2 shell effectively prevented the sintering of hollow carbon and metal NPs at high temperature, furnishing the well&#8208;dispersed nanoalloy catalysts and better catalytic performance. Moreover, the catalyst was durable and showed negligible activity decay in recycling and scale&#8208;up experiments, providing a mild and highly efficient way to access amines and arenes.

Dominoes under investigation: Tandem application of crystallography and mass spectrometry unraveled a competitive in situ domino solvothermal reaction to tetrabenzimidazol&#8208;pyrazine within [Co2(3)Cl4] in seven steps and to a deprotonated imide anion L2&#8242;&#8242; within 1D chain ([Co1.5(L2&#8242;&#8242;)]n) in six steps.







Abstract
Herein, the reaction of (1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1&#8201;H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methanamine (L1) with Co(H2O)6Cl2, in CH3CN at 120&#8201;&#176;C, leading to the 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrakis(1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1&#8201;H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyrazine (3), isolated as a dimeric cluster {[CoII2(3)Cl4]&#8901;2&#8201;CH3CN} (2), is reported. When O2 and H2O are present, (1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1&#8201;H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole&#8208;2&#8208;carbonyl)amide (HL1&#8242;) is first formed and crystallized as [CoIII(L1)2(L1&#8242;)]Cl2&#8901;2&#8201;H2O (4) before fusion of HL1&#8242; with L1, giving 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;(1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1&#8201;H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;carbonyl)&#8208;1&#8201;H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;carboxamide (HL2&#8242;&#8242;) forming a one&#8208;dimensional (1D) chain of [CoII3(L2&#8242;&#8242;)2Cl4]n (5). The combination of crystallography and mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) of isolated crystals and the solutions taken from the reaction as a function time reveal seven intermediate steps leading to 2, but six steps for 5, for which a different sequence takes place. Control and isotope labeling experiments confirm the two carbonyl oxygen atoms in 5 originate from both air and water. The dependence on the metals, compared with FeCl3&#8901;6&#8201;H2O leading to a stable triheteroarylmethyl radical, is quite astounding, which could be attributed to the different oxidation states of the metals and coordination modes confirmed by DFT calculations. This metal and valence dependent process is a very useful way for selectively obtaining these large molecules, which are unachievable by common organic synthesis.

         <title>Reversibly Switchable Phase&#8208;Dependent Emission of Quinoline and Phenothiazine Derivatives towards Applications in Optical Sensing and Information Multicoding</title>

Switchable TADF: New phenothiazine and quinoline derivatives exhibit outstanding phase&#8208;dependent reversibility between ON/OFF states (low and high emission intensity, drastic shifting of emission colors, short&#8208; and long&#8208;lived fluorescence) in systematic grinding/fuming cycles, required for multichannel memory devices based on optical information multicoding. TADF: thermally activated delayed fluorescence.







Abstract
Three new quinoline and di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl phenothiazine isomeric derivatives were synthesized and characterized towards applications for oxygen sensing and optical information multicoding. The compounds with phenylene linker showed outstanding phase&#8208;dependent reversibility between ON/OFF states (low and high emission intensity, drastic shifting of emission colors, short&#8208; and long&#8208;lived fluorescence) in systematic grinding/fuming cycles, as required for multichannel memory devices based on optical information multicoding. The conformational diversity of the phenothiazine unit resulted in dual emission of the doped films implemented by the different luminescence mechanisms with peaks located at 414/530, 416/540, and 440/582&#8197;nm. The presence of a phenylene linker and thus two rotational degrees of freedom resulted in quenching of the delayed fluorescence of quasi&#8208;equatorial conformers in the solid state. The compound containing no phenylene bridge was characterized by two different driving photoluminescence mechanisms of the doped films: short fluorescence of the quasi&#8208;axial conformer and thermally activated delayed fluorescence of the quasi&#8208;equatorial form. This compound showed oxygen sensitivity with a Stern&#8211;Volmer constant of 7.5&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;ppm&#8722;1.

SNAc with organolithiums under air: Aliphatic and (hetero)aromatic ketones are quickly (20&#8197;s reaction time) obtained in up to 93&#8201;% yield in a straightforward and chemoselective manner and with a broad substrate scope by reacting organolithium reagents with a variety of amides at ambient temperature under air in the environmentally friendly cyclopentyl methyl ether (CPME). Gram&#8208;scale preparations and recyclability of the reagents are also successfully demonstrated.







Abstract
We report that the nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction of aliphatic and (hetero)aromatic amides by organolithium reagents proceeds quickly (20&#8197;s reaction time), efficiently, and chemoselectively with a broad substrate scope in the environmentally responsible cyclopentyl methyl ether, at ambient temperature and under air, to provide ketones in up to 93&#8201;% yield with an effective suppression of the notorious over&#8208;addition reaction. Detailed DFT calculations and NMR investigations support the experimental results. The described methodology was proven to be amenable to scale&#8208;up and recyclability protocols. Contrasting classical procedures carried out under inert atmospheres, this work lays the foundation for a profound paradigm shift of the reactivity of carboxylic acid amides with organolithiums, with ketones being straightforwardly obtained by simply combining the reagents under aerobic conditions and with no need of using previously modified or pre&#8208;activated amides, as recommended.

Pt nanobars: A facile route to the preparation of Pt nanobars with aspect ratios tunable up to 2.1 is reported by simply reducing a PtIV precursor in N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide at 160&#8201;&#176;C in the presence of poly(vinyl pyrrolidone). Our mechanistic study indicates that the anisotropic growth results from both particle coalescence and localized oxidative etching followed by preferential growth.







Abstract
Noble&#8208;metal nanocrystals with anisotropic shapes have received increasing interest owing to their unique properties. Here, a facile route to the preparation of Pt nanobars with aspect ratios tunable up to 2.1 was reported by simply reducing a PtIV precursor in N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) at 160&#8201;&#176;C in the presence of poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP). In addition to its commonly observed roles as a solvent and a reductant, DMF could also decompose to generate CO, a capping agent capable of selectively passivating Pt{100} facets to promote the formation of nanobars. The size and aspect ratio of the nanobars could be tuned by varying the amount of PtIV precursor involved in the synthesis, as well as the concentration of PVP because of its dual roles as a stabilizer and a co&#8208;reductant. Our mechanistic study indicated that the anisotropic growth resulted from both particle coalescence and localized oxidative etching followed by preferential growth.

NIR dyes: Simple and readily synthesizable BF2 complexes of tert&#8208;amine&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;cyanoformazans are shown to absorb and emit light at wavelengths that are unusually long for such small molecules (&#955;abs=691&#8211;760&#8197;nm, &#955;PL=834&#8211;904&#8197;nm in toluene). Detailed investigations of several such complexes reveal that strong charge transfer is not a prerequisite for their near&#8208;infrared activity.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes are sought after for their utility in light harvesting, bioimaging, and light&#8208;mediated therapies. Since long&#8208;wavelength photoluminescence typically involves extensive &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems of double bonds and aromatic rings, it is often assumed that NIR dyes have to be large molecules that require complex syntheses. We challenge this assumption by demonstrating that facile incorporation of tertiary amine groups into readily available 3&#8208;cyanoformazans affords efficient production of relatively simple NIR&#8208;active BF2 formazanate dyes (&#955;abs=691&#8211;760&#8197;nm, &#955;PL=834&#8211;904&#8197;nm in toluene). Cyclic voltammetry experiments on these compounds reveal multiple reversible redox waves linked to the interplay between the tertiary amine and BF2 formazanate moieties. Density&#8208;functional calculations indicate that the NIR electronic transitions in BF2 formazanates are of &#960;&#8594;&#960;*&#8208;type, but do not always involve strong charge transfer.

Isomers of nitrenium cations [C6H4N2(tBu)C(C12H8)][BF4], 1 and 2, react with carbenes and phosphines and phosphide. Small donors form N&#8208;bound Lewis adducts. Larger donors attack at the aryl carbon para&#8208;to N, where phosphines induces proton migration ring opening the N2C3 ring, while carbene prompt loss of H. affording radical cation salts. Reactions of 1 and 2 with KPPh2 effects electron transfer affording (PPh2)2 and persistent radical products.







Abstract
Alkylation of spiro[fluorene&#8208;9,3&#8217;&#8208;indazole] at N(1) and N(2) with tBuCl affords the nitrenium cations [C6H4N2(tBu)C(C12H8)][BF4], 1 and 2, respectively. Compound&#8197;1 converts to 2 over the temperature range 303&#8211;323&#8197;K with a free energy barrier of 28&#177;5&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. Reaction of 1 with PMe3 afforded the N&#8208;bound phosphine adduct [C6H4N(tBu)N(PMe3)C(C12H8)]BF4] 3. However, phosphines attack 2 at the para&#8208;carbon atom of the aryl group with concurrent cleavage of N(2)&#8722;C(1) bond and proton migration to C(1) affording [(R3P)C6H3NN(tBu)CH(C12H8)][BF4] (R=Me 4, nBu 5). Analogous reactions of 1 and 2 with the carbene SIMes prompt attack at the para&#8208;carbon with concurrent loss of H. affording the radical cation salts [(SIMes)C6H3N(tBu)NC(C12H8).][BF4] 6 and [(SIMes)C6H3NN(tBu)C(C12H8).][BF4] 7, whereas reaction of 2 with BAC gives the Lewis acid&#8208;base adduct, [C6H4N(BAC)N(tBu)C(C12H8)][BF4] 8. Finally, reactions of 1 and 2 with KPPh2 result in electron transfer affording (PPh2)2 and the persistent radicals C6H4N(tBu)NC(C12H8). and C6H4NN(tBu)C(C12H8).. The detailed reaction mechanisms are also explored by extensive DFT calculations.

Two N&#8208;methylpyridinium compounds and analogous N&#8208;protonated salts of 2&#8208; and 2,7&#8208;substituted 4&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;pyrene compounds were synthesised and their crystal structures, photophysical properties both in solution and in the solid state, electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical properties were studied. Upon methylation or protonation, the emission maxima are significantly bathochromically shifted compared to the neutral compounds, although the absorption maxima remain almost unchanged. As a result, the cationic compounds show very large apparent Stokes shifts of up to 7200&#8197;cm&#8722;1. The N&#8208;methylpyridinium compounds have a single reduction at ca. &#8722;1.5&#8197;V vs. Fc/Fc+ in MeCN. While the reduction process was reversible for the 2,7&#8208;disubstituted compound, it was irreversible for the mono&#8208;substituted one. Experimental findings are complemented by DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations. Furthermore, the N&#8208;methylpyridinium compounds show strong interactions with calf thymus (ct)&#8208;DNA, presumably by intercalation, which paves the way for further applications of these multi&#8208;functional compounds as potential DNA&#8208;bioactive agents.

         <title>Flexible yet Robust Framework of Tin(II) Oxide Carbodiimide for Reversible Lithium Storage</title>

Linked by MOFs: Sn2O(CN2) with loosely packed crystal structure possesses a metal&#8211;organic framework&#8208;like porous framework, which mitigates volume expansion and Sn atom aggregation. Sn2O(CN2) shows a significantly enhanced lithium storage performance compared to traditional tin oxide.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) can become promising electrode materials for advanced lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), because their loosely packed porous structures may mitigate volume expansion and metal atom aggregation, which occur at the respective metal oxides. However, they suffer from poor electrical conductivity and irreversible structural degradation upon charge/discharge processes, which impede their practical utilization. Herein, we investigate MOF&#8208;like Sn2O(CN2) as a new electrode material. The conductive yet flexible [N=C=N] linkers are tilted between [Sn4O] nodes and cross&#8208;linked into a porous quasi&#8208;layered structure. Such structure offers abundant channels for fast Li&#8208;ion transport and tolerance of enormous volume expansion. Notably, anisotropic [N=C=N]2&#8722; arrays hardly migrate so that Sn0 nanodots are physically separated via robust [N=C=N]2&#8722; framework during discharge, thereby effectively preventing the formation of large Sn islands. Owing to the structural advantage, the Sn2O(CN2) electrode exhibits an initial Coulombic efficiency as high as &#8764;80&#8201;%. With the addition of graphite as conductive supporter, the electrode provides 978&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 even after 300&#8197;cycles. Such MOF&#8208;like carbodiimides hold potential for the advanced electrodes in LIBs and other battery systems.

         <title>Rh&#8208;Catalyzed Decarbonylative Cross&#8208;Coupling between o&#8208;Carboranes and Twisted Amides: A Regioselective, Additive&#8208;Free, and Concise Late&#8208;Stage Carboranylation</title>

Rh catalysis was used to enable cross&#8208;coupling between o&#8208;carborane and twisted amide. A series of regioselective B(3,6)&#8722;C, B(3,5)&#8722;Ar and B(4)&#8722;C(sp3) coupling products have been obtained. The operationally simple reaction gives rise to diverse carboranyl&#8208;fused organic motifs and accommodates late&#8208;stage diversification, which may pave a new way for medicinal investigations.







Abstract
The convenient cross&#8208;coupling of sp2 or sp3 carbons with a specific boron vertex on carborane cage represents significant synthetic values and insurmountable challenges. In this work, we report an Rh&#8208;catalyzed reaction between o&#8208;carborane and N&#8208;acyl&#8208;glutarimides to construct various Bcage&#8722;C bonds. Under the optimized condition, the removable imine directing group (DG) leads to B(3)&#8722; or B(3,6)&#8722;C couplings, while the pyridyl DG leads to B(3,5)&#8722;Ar coupling. In particular, an unexpected rearrangement of amide reagent is observed in pyridyl directed B(4)&#8722;C(sp3) formation. This scalable protocol has many advantages, including easy access, the use of cheap and widely available coupling agents, no requirement of an external ligand, base or oxidant, high efficiency, and a broad substrate scope. Leveraging the RhI dimer and twisted amides, this method enables straightforward access to diversely substituted and therapeutically important carborane derivatives at boron site, and provides a highly valuable vista for carborane&#8208;based drug screening.

         <title>Excitation Energy Transfer and Exchange&#8208;Mediated Quartet State Formation in Porphyrin&#8208;Trityl Systems</title>

Photogenerated multi&#8208;spin systems composed of a porphyrin chromophore and a trityl radical are investigated with respect to their optical and magnetic properties. Profiting from the time&#8208;resolution of fs&#8208;TA spectroscopy and the capability of EPR to distinguish near&#8208;degenerate states with different spin multiplicity, this work reports unique insight into the excited&#8208;state reaction mechanism and suggests improvements to the molecular design in view of applications in the fields of molecular spintronics and artificial photosynthesis.







Abstract
Photogenerated multi&#8208;spin systems hold great promise for a range of technological applications in various fields, including molecular spintronics and artificial photosynthesis. However, the further development of these applications, via targeted design of materials with specific magnetic properties, currently still suffers from a lack of understanding of the factors influencing the underlying excited state dynamics and mechanisms on a molecular level. In particular, systematic studies, making use of different techniques to obtain complementary information, are largely missing. This work investigates the photophysics and magnetic properties of a series of three covalently&#8208;linked porphyrin&#8208;trityl compounds, bridged by a phenyl spacer. By combining the results from femtosecond transient absorption and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies, we determine the efficiencies of the competing excited state reaction pathways and characterise the magnetic properties of the individual spin states, formed by the interaction between the chromophore triplet and the stable radical. The differences observed for the three investigated compounds are rationalised in the context of available theoretical models and the implications of the results of this study for the design of a molecular system with an improved intersystem crossing efficiency are discussed.

Hairpin pyrrole&#8208;imidazole polyamides (hPIPs) and their chlorambucil (Chb) conjugates (hPIP&#8208;Chbs) can alkylate DNA in a sequence&#8208;specific manner, and have been studied as anticancer drugs. Here, we conjugated Chb to a cyclic PIP (cPIP), which is known to have a higher binding affinity than the corresponding hPIP, and investigated the DNA alkylation properties of the resulting cPIP&#8208;Chb using the optimized capillary electrophoresis method and conventional HPLC product analysis. cPIP&#8208;Chb conjugate&#8197;3 showed higher alkylation activity at its binding sites than did hPIP&#8208;Chb conjugates&#8197;1 and 2. Subsequent HPLC analysis revealed that the alkylation site of conjugate&#8197;3, which was identified by capillary electrophoresis, was reliable and that conjugate&#8197;3 alkylates the N3 position of adenine as do hPIP&#8208;Chbs. Moreover, conjugate&#8197;3 showed higher cytotoxicity against LNCaP prostate cancer cells than did conjugate&#8197;1 and cytotoxicity comparable to that of conjugate&#8197;2. These results suggest that cPIP&#8208;Chbs could be novel DNA alkylating anticancer drugs.

         <title>Twofold C&#8722;H Activation Enables Synthesis of a Diazacoronene&#8208;Type Fluorophore with Near Infrared Emission Through Isosteric Replacement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 8, Page 2753-2759, February 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twofold C&#8722;H activation of diazaperylene by a rhodium catalyst produces a bis(amide)&#8208;embedded coronene, which retains high aromaticity and exhibits an intense near infrared fluorescence with a high quantum yield. Thus, the replacement of C=C double bonds with amides represents a useful strategy for emissive polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). Further complexation with B(C6F5)3 enhances the aromaticity of the amide&#8208;embedded hexagon rings.







Abstract
The synthesis and photophysical properties of a soluble amide&#8208;embedded coronene is reported. The key step in this synthesis is the twofold C&#8722;H activation of diazaperylene by a rhodium(III)Cp* catalyst. This unprecedented structural motif shows intense fluorescence in the near infrared region with a small Stokes shift and a distinct vibronic structure, which exhibits a slight extent of negative solvatochromism. Comparison of this compound with some relevant compounds revealed the importance of the amide incorporation in the peripheral concave region including an angular position to retain high aromaticity reflecting that of parent coronene. Treatment of this compound with Lewis acid B(C6F5)3 formed a bis&#8208;adduct, which exhibited enhanced aromaticity as a consequence of the increased double bond character of the amide C&#8722;N bonds.

         <title>The Aggregation Pattern of A&#946;1&#8211;40 is Altered by the Presence of N&#8208;Truncated A&#946;4&#8211;40 and/or CuII in a Similar Way through Ionic Interactions</title>

Converging mechanisms: The similar effect of A&#946;4&#8211;40 and substoichiometric CuII on the kinetic parameters of A&#946;1&#8211;40 aggregation and fibril morphology correlates with the increased positive charge at the A&#946; N terminus induced by CuII complexation or N truncation at position 4, thus providing a unifying mechanistic concept for the biological aggregation of coexisting A&#946; species (see figure).







Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common of the multifactorial diseases and is characterized by a range of abnormal molecular processes, such as the accumulation of extracellular plaques containing the amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptides and dyshomeostasis of copper in the brain. In this study, we have investigated the effect of CuII on the aggregation of A&#946;1&#8211;40 and A&#946;4&#8211;40, representing the two most prevalent families of A&#946; peptides, that is, the full length and N&#8208;truncated peptides. Both families are similarly abundant in healthy and AD brains. For either of the studied peptides, substoichiometric CuII concentrations accelerated aggregation, whereas superstoichiometric CuII inhibited fibril formation, likely by stabilizing the oligomers. The addition of either A&#946;4&#8211;40 or substoichiometric CuII affected the aggregation profile of A&#946;1&#8211;40, by yielding shorter and thicker fibrils; amorphous aggregates were formed in the presence of a molar excess of CuII. The similarity of these two effects can be attributed to the increase in the positive charge on the A&#946; N terminus, caused both by CuII complexation and N truncation at position 4. Our findings provide a better understanding of the biological A&#946; aggregation process as these two A&#946; species and CuII coexist and interact under physiological conditions.

Water in non&#8208;hydrolytic sol&#8208;gel: In situ water formation during the synthesis of mesoporous zirconia has been systematically investigated. Significant amounts of water were found in several cases, notably in the reactions of Zr(OnPr)4 with ketones and of ZrCl4 with alcohols or acetone. Conversely, the reactions of Zr(OnPr)4 with acetic anhydride or benzyl alcohol at moderate temperature (200&#8201;&#176;C) and of ZrCl4 with diisopropyl ether were strictly non&#8208;hydrolytic. Water played a major role on the structure of the final zirconia: tetragonal ZrO2 was favored in strictly non&#8208;hydrolytic routes, while monoclinic ZrO2 was favored in the presence of water. More information can be found in the Full Paper by P.&#8197;H. Mutin et&#8197;al. on page 2670.

The photo&#8208;induced formation of a quartet state in a molecular conjugate consisting of a porphyrin and a trityl moiety is depicted in the cover image. Such photogenerated multi&#8208;spin systems hold great promise for applications in quantum information technology, artificial photosynthesis, as well as spin catalysis. The quartet state formation was scrutinised by femtosecond UV/Vis absorption and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies, providing unique insight into the excited state reaction mechanism. Image design by Niklas Markloff, with contributions from Oliver Nolden. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S. Richert et&#8197;al. on page 2683.

         <title>Front Cover: Tunable Synthesis of Hierarchical Yolk/Double&#8208;Shelled SiOx@TiO2@C Nanospheres for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries (Chem. Eur. J. 8/2021)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 8, Page 2551-2551, February 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Yolk/double&#8208;shelled SiOx@TiO2@C nanospheres with different voids were successfully prepared, and the regulation of SiOx yolk was achieved by changing the etching time. The etching time of SiOx yolk affects the morphology and electrochemical performance of SiOx@TiO2@C. The dial represents the etching time of SiOx yolk in NaOH solution and the brightness of the Chinese red lantern represents the electrochemical performance of the composites. When the etching time is 60&#8197;min, SiOx@TiO2@C with 30&#8197;nm void exhibits remarkable performance as an anode for lithium&#8211;ion batteries. More information can be found in the Full Paper by G.&#8197;Zhou et&#8197;al. on page 2654.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 8, February 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stereoselectivity and yield of glycosylation reactions are influenced by numerous intrinsic and environmental factors. Their optimization is therefore challenging and time&#8208;consuming. Computer&#8208;aided synthesis has provided an attractive approach to predict the performance of the reactions. This Concept article by C.&#8208;C. Wang and colleagues on page 2556 introduces the recent achievements on the statistical analysis to glycosylation reactions. The numerous variables that have been systematically dissected with new guidelines and novel strategies in stereoselective glycosylations are outlined.

Breslow Intermediates are of pivotal importance for chemical and biological Umpolung reactions catalyzed by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs). In the sense of John&#8197;B. Fenn (NP 2002), attachment of a charge tag to these &#8220;molecular elephants&#8221; provides them with &#8220;electrospray wings&#8221;, and for the first time allows their gase phase structural characterization by infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy. The enol&#8208;ketone tautomerism of a number of NHC&#8208;aldehyde combinations, crucial for their chemical reactivity, have been determined in the gas&#8208;phase and interpreted by DFT calculations. More information can be found in the Full Paper by M. Breugst, A.&#8197;J.&#8197;H.&#8197;M. Meijer, M. Sch&#228;fer, A. Berkessel, et&#8197;al. on page 2662.

Abstract
Callyspongiolide, a macrolide natural product with a conjugated diene&#8208;ynic side chain, has garnered significant attention from the synthetic community since its isolation from a sea sponge in 2013. Herein, the approaches that have been applied to this bioactive natural product to date are reviewed. These synthetic endeavors have established the absolute stereochemistry of this molecule and allowed further investigation into its promising caspase&#8208;independent bioactivity, while also contributing to the wider field of macrolide synthesis.

         <title>Main Group Metal&#8208;Mediated Transformations of Imines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 8, Page 2569-2588, February 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imines are prevalent in synthetic laboratories due to their versatile reactivity profiles, providing access to various N&#8208;containing molecules. Herein, this review summarizes well established main group metal&#8208;mediated transformations and recent developments in current topics including C&#8211;F activation, catalysis, sustainable reaction media and flow chemistry.







Abstract
Main&#8208;group&#8208;metal&#8208;mediated transformations of imines have earned a valued place in the synthetic chemist's toolbox. Their versatility allows the simple preparation of various nitrogen containing compounds. This review will outline the early discoveries including metallation, addition/cyclisation and metathesis pathways, followed by the modern&#8208;day use of imines in synthetic methodology. Recent advances in imine C&#8722;F activation protocols are discussed, alongside revisiting &#8220;classic&#8221; imine reactivity from a sustainable perspective. Developments in catalytic methods for hydroelementation of imines have been reviewed, highlighting the importance of s&#8208;block metals in the catalytic arena. Whilst stoichiometric transformations in alternative reaction media such as deep eutectic solvents or water have been summarised. The incorporation of imines into flow chemistry has received recent attention and is summarised within.

Supramolecular chemistry: The design and synthesis of urea&#8208;substituted RhIII&#8208;cyclopentadienyl catalysts, which accelerate the C&#8722;H olefination of benzoic acid derivatives, is reported. The catalysts&#8217; substrate recognition ability mediated by H&#8208;bonding is identified to be the reason for this effect. Its application to a variety of substrates proves the catalyst system's advantages compared to the results obtained with widely used [RhCp*Cl2]2.







Abstract
The design and synthesis of air&#8208;stable and conveniently crystallizable RhIII&#8208;cyclopentadienyl catalysts substituted with a urea moiety, which are able to accelerate the C&#8722;H olefination of benzoic acid derivatives, is reported. Through kinetic studies and NMR titration experiments, the catalysts&#8217; substrate recognition ability mediated by hydrogen bonding was identified to be the reason for this effect. Introduction of pyridone&#8208;phosphine ligands capable of forming additional H&#8208;bond interactions increased the catalytic performance even further. By unveiling a proportionality between reaction rate and relative complex formation enthalpy the hypothesis of a supramolecular catalyst preformation was supported. Its application to a variety of substrates proved the catalyst system's advantages, generally increasing the yields when compared to the results obtained with widely used [RhCp*Cl2]2.

         <title>Direct Trifluoromethylation of Alcohols Using a Hypervalent Iodosulfoximine Reagent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 8, Page 2638-2642, February 5, 2021. </description>

Trilfuoromethylethers made easy! An operationally simple method using the new hypervalent iodosulfoximine reagent alongside minimal amounts of a zinc catalyst gives access to a variety of different trifluoromethylethers, in under 2&#8197;h for most cases.







Abstract
The direct trifluoromethylation of a variety of aliphatic alcohols using a hypervalent iodosulfoximine reagent afforded the corresponding ethers in moderate to good yields (14&#8211;72&#8201;%). Primary, secondary, and even tertiary alcohols, including examples derived from natural products, underwent this transformation in the presence of catalytic amounts of zinc bis(triflimide). Typical reaction conditions involved a neat mixture of 6.0&#8197;equivalents of the alcohol with 1.0&#8197;equivalent of the reagent, with the majority of reactions complete within 2&#8197;h with 2.5&#8197;mol&#8201;% of the Lewis acid catalyst. Furthermore, experimental evidence was provided that the C&#8722;O bond&#8208;forming process occurred via the coordination of the alcohol to the iodine atom and subsequent reductive elimination.

         <title>Easy Access to Enantiomerically Pure Heterocyclic Silicon&#8208;Chiral Phosphonium Cations and the Matched/Mismatched Case of Dihydrogen Release</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 8, Page 2649-2653, February 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral silyl phosphonium ions are a synthetically valuable class of compounds from a stereochemical and preparative point of view. Convenient routes towards small and configurationally stable, silicon&#8208;chiral four&#8208;membered heterocyclic cations are disclosed (see scheme). By combining experimental, spectroscopic, stereochemical, and computational methods, a matched/mismatched case was identified for both dehydrogenation and protodesilylation and the intermolecularity of these reactions proven.







Abstract
Phosphonium ions are widely used in preparative organic synthesis and catalysis. The provision of new types of cations that contain both functional and chiral information is a major synthetic challenge and can open up new horizons in asymmetric cation&#8208;directed and Lewis acid catalysis. We discovered an efficient methodology towards new Si&#8208;chiral four&#8208;membered CPSSi* heterocyclic cations. Three synthetic approaches are presented. The stereochemical sequence of anchimerically assisted cation formation with B(C6F5)3 and subsequent hydride addition was fully elucidated and proceeds with excellent preservation of the chiral information at the stereogenic silicon atom. Also the mechanism of dihydrogen release from a protonated hydrosilane was studied in detail by the help of Si&#8208;centered chirality as stereochemical probe. Chemoselectivity switch (dihydrogen release vs. protodesilylation) can easily be achieved through slight modifications of the solvent. A matched/mismatched case was identified and the intermolecularity of this reaction supported by spectroscopic, kinetic, deuterium&#8208;labeling experiments, and quantum chemical calculations.

Combine and conquer: A new method for the generation of radical species that does not require photoirradiation, radical initiators, or preactivated substrates is reported. The combined use of an azolium salt and hydroquinone generated an efficient catalytic system for the aerobic C&#8722;C&#8208;bond cleavage of 2&#8208;substituted ketones. A reaction mechanism is proposed based on the results of diffusion&#8208;ordered spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry measurements, as well as computational studies.







Abstract
Organo&#8208;radical catalysts have recently attracted great interest, and the development of this field can be expected to broaden the applications of organocatalysis. Herein, the first example of a radical&#8208;generating system is reported that does not require any photoirradiation, radical initiators, or preactivated substrates. The oxidative C&#8722;C&#8208;bond cleavage of 2&#8208;substituted cyclohexanones was achieved using an azolium salt and a hydroquinone as co&#8208;catalysts. A catalytic mechanism was proposed based on the results of diffusion&#8208;ordered spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry measurements, as well as computational studies.

         <title>Multi C&#8722;H Functionalization Reactions of Carbazole Heterocycles via Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Carbene Transfer Reactions</title>

Paved with gold: We describe a multiple C&#8722;H functionalization reaction of carbazole heterocycles with diazoalkanes. We show that gold catalysts play a distinct role in enabling a multiple C&#8722;H functionalization reaction to introduce up to six carbene fragments onto molecules containing multiple carbazole units or to link multiple carbazole units into a single molecule. A one&#8208;pot stepwise approach enables the introduction of two different carbene fragments to allow orthogonal deprotection and straightforward derivatization.

Building single&#8208;molecule magnets: A compressed octahedral dysprosium(III) single&#8208;molecule magnet with local D4h symmetry exhibits an energy barrier over 2000&#8197;K.







Abstract
Three six&#8208;coordinate DyIII single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) [Dy(OtBu)2(L)4]+ with local D4h symmetry are obtained by optimizing the equatorial ligands. One of the compounds with L=4&#8208;phenylpyridine shows an energy barrier (Ueff) of 2075(11)&#8197;K, which is the third largest Ueff, and the first Ueff&gt;2000&#8197;K for SMMs with axial&#8208;type symmetry so far. Ab initio analysis indicates that the exceptional uniaxial magnetic anisotropy is deeply related to the axially compressed octahedral geometry. This work provides a new insight into the local D4h symmetry for high&#8208;performance SMMs.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Extended Carbazole Derivatives as Host Materials for Highly Efficient and Long&#8208;Life Green Phosphorescent Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extended host: Expansion of the &#960; conjugation of a carbazole derivative by benzothiophene units enhances its performance as a host in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. The &#960;&#8208;extended host material exhibits lower efficiency roll&#8208;off and longer operational lifetime at 50&#8201;% of the initial luminance (LT50) of approximately 23&#8201;000&#8197;h at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 compared with conventional host materials.







Abstract
High&#8208;performance organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) that use phosphorescent and/or thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters are capable of realizing 100&#8201;% electron&#8208;to&#8208;photon conversion. The host materials in these OLEDs play crucial roles in determining OLED performance. Carbazole derivatives are frequently used as host materials, among which 3,3&#8208;bis(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)biphenyl (mCBP) is often used for lifetime testing in scientific studies. In this study, the &#960; conjugation of the carbazole unit was expanded to enhance OLED lifetime by designing and developing two benzothienocarbazole (BTCz)&#8208;based host materials, namely m1BTCBP and m4BTCBP. Among these host materials, m1BTCBP formed a highly efficient [Ir(ppy)3]&#8208;based OLED with an operational luminescence half&#8208;life (LT50) of over 300&#8197;h at an initial luminance of approximately 12000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 (current density: 25&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). The LT50 value at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was estimated to be about 23&#8201;000&#8197;h. This performance is clearly higher than that of mCBP&#8208;based OLEDs (LT50&#8776;8500&#8197;h).

In this study, the &#960; conjugation of the carbazole unit was expanded to enhance OLED lifetime by designing and developing two benzothienocarbazole (BTCz)&#8208;based host materials, namely &lt;b&gt;m1BTCBP&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;m4BTCBP&lt;/b&gt;. Among these host materials, &lt;b&gt;m1BTCBP&lt;/b&gt; formed a highly efficient [Ir(ppy)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8208;based OLED with an operational luminescence half&#8208;life (LT&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) of over 300&#8197;h at an initial luminance of approximately 12000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (current density: 25&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The LT&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; was estimated to be about 23&#8201;000&#8197;h. This performance is clearly higher than that of &lt;b&gt;mCBP&lt;/b&gt;&#8208;based OLEDs (LT&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;&#8776;8500&#8197;h).&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>3D&#8208;Non&#8208;destructive Imaging through Heavy&#8208;Metal Eosin Salt Contrast Agents</title>

Add some color: The dibromo fluorescein barium salt proves to be a suitable staining agent enabling the diagnostic screening of tissue samples by X&#8208;ray microscopic computed tomography without impending further diagnostics through histological methods.







Abstract
Conventional histology is a destructive technique based on the evaluation of 2D slices of a 3D biopsy. By using 3D X&#8208;ray histology these obstacles can be overcome, but their application is still restricted due to the inherently low attenuation properties of soft tissue. In order to solve this problem, the tissue can be stained before X&#8208;ray computed tomography imaging (CT) to enhance the soft tissue X&#8208;ray contrast. Evaluation of brominated fluorescein salts revealed a mutual influence of the number of bromine atoms and the cations applied on the achieved contrast enhancement. The dibromo fluorescein barium salt turned out to be the ideal X&#8208;ray contrast agent, allowing for 3D imaging and subsequent complementing counterstaining applying standard histological techniques.

         <title>Aromatic Metamorphosis of Thiophenes by Means of Desulfurative Dilithiation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Desulfurative dilithiation of thiophenes and benzo&#8208;fused derivatives using lithium metal has been developed for the efficient generation of multi&#8208;substituted 1,4&#8208;dilithium compounds. The resulting dianions are key intermediates for the synthesis of diverse heteroles. This protocol also enables the desulfurative construction of aromatic rings from thiophene derivatives in a one&#8208;pot manner.







Abstract
A new mode of aromatic metamorphosis has been developed, which allows thiophenes and their benzo&#8208;fused derivatives to be converted to a variety of exotic heteroles. This transformation involves 1)&#8197;the efficient generation of key 1,4&#8208;dianions by means of desulfurative dilithiation with lithium powder and 2)&#8197;the subsequent trapping of the dianions with heteroatom electrophiles in a one&#8208;pot manner. Via the desulfurative dilithiation, the sulfur atoms of thiophenes are replaced also with a carbon&#8211;carbon double bond or a 1,2&#8208;phenylene for the construction of benzene rings.

         <title>Thermally Responsive Poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;Based Polyrotaxanes Bearing Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Pillar[5]arene Rings**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Keeping in shape: Poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;based polyrotaxanes were produced from pillar[5]arene as ring components by precipitation in water/methanol and a subsequent capping reaction. Multiple hydrogen bonds involving the pillar[5]arene OH groups were critically important for the preparation and also provided a high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polyrotaxane with heat&#8208;induced elasticity and shape memory properties without additional crosslinking.







Abstract
Poly(ethylene oxide)s (PEOs) are useful polymers with good water solubility, biological compatibility, and commercial availability. PEOs with various end groups were threaded into pillar[5]arene rings in a mixture of water and methanol to afford pseudopolyrotaxanes. Corresponding polyrotaxanes were also constructed by capping COOH&#8208;terminated pseudopolyrotaxanes with bulky amines, in which multiple hydrogen bonds involving the pillar[5]arene OH groups were critically important to prevent dethreading. The number of threaded ring components could be rationally controlled in these materials, providing a simple and versatile method to tune the mechanical and thermal properties. Specifically, a polyrotaxane with a high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight axle became elastic upon heating above the melting point of PEOs and exhibited temperature&#8208;dependent shape memory property because of the topological confinement and crosslinked hydrogen bonds.

         <title>Ultrafast Dynamics and Photoresponse of a Fungi&#8208;Derived Pigment Xylindein from Solution to Thin Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic semiconductor materials have recently gained momentum due to their non&#8208;toxicity, low cost, and sustainability. Xylindein is a remarkably photostable pigment secreted by fungi that grow on decaying wood, its relatively strong electronic performance is enabled by &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and hydrogen&#8208;bonding network that promote charge transport. Herein, we used femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy with a near&#8208;IR probe to unveil a rapid excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer reaction. Conformational motions lead to a conical intersection that quenches fluorescence in the monomeric state. In concentrated solutions, nascent aggregates exhibit a faster excited state lifetime due to excimer formation, confirmed by the excimer&#8594;charge&#8208;transfer excited&#8208;state absorption band of the xylindein thin film, thus limiting its optoelectronic performance. Therefore, extending the xylindein sidechains with branched alkyl groups may hinder the excimer formation and improve optoelectronic properties of naturally derived materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective CO2 Sorption Using Compartmentalized Coordination Polymers with Discrete Voids**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It's a trap! The use of a metal&#8208;organic material with discrete voids serves to efficiently trap CO2 from different gas mixtures. Dynamic breakthrough experiments show an excellent selectivity and regenerability in mixtures with CH4 and N2.







Abstract
Carbon capture and storage with porous materials is one of the most promising technologies to minimize CO2 release into the atmosphere. Here, we report a family of compartmentalized coordination polymers (CCPs) capable of capturing gas molecules in a selective manner based on two novel tetrazole&#8208;based ligands. Crystal structures have been modelled theoretically under the Density Functional Theory (DFT) revealing the presence of discrete voids of 380&#8197;&#197;3. Single gas adsorption isotherms of N2, CH4 and CO2 have been measured, obtaining a loading capacity of 0.6, 1.7 and 2.2 molecules/void at 10&#8197;bar and at 298&#8197;K for the best performing material. Moreover, they present excellent selectivity and regenerability for CO2 in mixtures with CH4 and N2 in comparison with other reported materials, as evidenced by dynamic breakthrough gas experiments. These frameworks are therefore great candidates for separation of gas mixtures in the chemical engineering industry.

         <title>Ring&#8208;Closing Olefin Metathesis Catalyzed by Well&#8208;Defined Vanadium Alkylidene Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Well&#8208;defined vanadium alkylidene complexes catalyze ring&#8208;closing olefin metathesis of various dienes with activity acceptable for routine organic synthesis. The catalytic activity strongly depends on the size and electron&#8208;donating properties of the imido group, as well as the size and &#963;&#8208;donating properties of the phosphine.







Abstract
Vanadium&#8208;based catalysts have shown activity and selectivity in ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization of strained cyclic olefins comparable to those of Ru, Mo, and W catalysts. However, the application of V alkylidenes in routine organic synthesis is limited. Here, we present the first example of ring&#8208;closing olefin metathesis catalyzed by well&#8208;defined V chloride alkylidene phosphine complexes. The developed catalysts exhibit tolerance to various functional groups, such as an ether, an ester, a tertiary amide, a tertiary amine, and a sulfonamide. The size and electron&#8208;donating properties of the imido group and the phosphine play a crucial role in the stability of active intermediates. Reactions with ethylene and olefins suggest that both &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination of the metallacyclobutene and bimolecular decomposition are responsible for catalyst degradation.

         <title>An Antimony(III) Fluoride Oxalate with Large Birefringence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic combination of different functional groups has led to the first antimony(III) fluoride oxalate material, KSb2C2O4F5, to exhibit a birefringent response (&#916;n=0.170 at 546&#8197;nm); this value is larger than that of the commercial &#945;&#8208;BaB2O4, despite its suboptimal anisotropic structure.







Abstract
Birefringent materials play a key role in modulating the polarization of light and thus in optical communication as well as in laser techniques and science. Designing new, excellent birefringent materials remains a challenge. In this work, we designed and synthesized the first antimony(III) fluoride oxalate birefringent material, KSb2C2O4F5, by a combination of delocalized &#960;&#8208;conjugated [C2O4]2&#8722; groups, stereochemical active Sb3+ cations, and the most electronegative element, fluorine. The [C2O4]2&#8722; groups are not in an optimal arrangement in the crystal structure of KSb2C2O4F5; nonetheless, KSb2C2O4F5 exhibits a large birefringence (&#916;n=0.170 at 546&#8197;nm) that is even better than that of the well&#8208;known commercial birefringent material &#945;&#8208;BaB2O4, even though the latter features an optimal arrangement of &#960;&#8208;conjugated [B3O6]3&#8722; groups. Based on first&#8208;principles calculations, this prominent birefringence should be attributed to the alliance of planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated [C2O4]2&#8722; anions, highly distorted SbO2F2 and SbOF3 polyhedra with a stereochemically active lone pair. The combination of lone&#8208;pair electrons and &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems boosts the birefringence to a large extent and will help the development of high&#8208;performance birefringent materials.

         <title>Proton Switch in the Secondary Coordination Sphere to Control Catalytic Events at the Metal Center: Biomimetic Oxo Transfer Chemistry of Nickel Amidate Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Proton&#8208;switchable&#8221; biomimetic metal complex: An oxo&#8208;transfer reaction at the metal center is controlled by protonation of the remote ligand sphere, which modulates electron donor ability of the ligand, promotes oxidant binding, and facilitates access to high&#8208;valent catalytic intermediates.







Abstract
High&#8208;valent metal&#8208;oxo species are key intermediates for the oxygen atom transfer step in the catalytic cycles of many metalloenzymes. While the redox&#8208;active metal centers of such enzymes are typically supported by anionic amino acid side chains or porphyrin rings, peptide backbones might function as strong electron&#8208;donating ligands to stabilize high oxidation states. To test the feasibility of this idea in synthetic settings, we have prepared a nickel(II) complex of new amido multidentate ligand. The mononuclear nickel complex of this N5 ligand catalyzes epoxidation reactions of a wide range of olefins by using mCPBA as a terminal oxidant. Notably, a remarkably high catalytic efficiency and selectivity were observed for terminal olefin substrates. We found that protonation of the secondary coordination sphere serves as the entry point to the catalytic cycle, in which high&#8208;valent nickel species is subsequently formed to carry out oxo&#8208;transfer reactions. A conceptually parallel process might allow metalloenzymes to control the catalytic cycle in the primary coordination sphere by using proton switch in the secondary coordination sphere.

         <title>Concentration&#8208;Dependent Self&#8208;Assembly of an Unusually Large Hexameric Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Molecular Cage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large, hexameric cage based on amide dimerization self&#8208;assembles from a designed macrocyclic building block in nonpolar solvents. The unusually large structure (V&#8764;2800&#8197;&#197;3) features openings commonly associated with covalently linked cages and forms host&#8211;guest complexes with fullerenes (C60 and C70). The formation of the hexameric structure was found to be strongly concentration dependent.







Abstract
The sizes of available self&#8208;assembled hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;based supramolecular capsules and cages are rather limited. The largest systems have volumes of approximately 1400&#8211;2300&#8197;&#197;3. Herein, we report a large, hexameric cage based on intermolecular amide&#8211;amide dimerization. The unusual structure with openings, reminiscent of covalently linked cages, is held together by 24 hydrogen bonds. With a diameter of 2.3&#8197;nm and a cavity volume of &#8764;2800&#8197;&#197;3, the assembly is larger than any previously known capsule/cage structure relying exclusively on hydrogen bonds. The self&#8208;assembly process in chlorinated, organic solvents was found to be strongly concentration dependent, with the monomeric form prevailing at low concentrations. Additionally, the formation of host&#8211;guest complexes with fullerenes (C60 and C70) was observed.

         <title>Personalized Reusable Face Masks with Smart Nano&#8208;Assisted Destruction of Pathogens for COVID&#8208;19: A Visionary Road</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Multifunctional masks for COVID: Multifunctional materials with unique chemical and physical properties can be fabricated by combining electrospun nanofibers, plasmonic nanoparticles, inorganic nanoclusters, and 3D printed structures. This concept article highlights smart nanomaterials&#8217; key role in developing the next generation of face masks with the highest impact in terms of self&#8208;sanitizing, filtration efficiency, and effective comfort.







Abstract
The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID&#8208;19) emergency has demonstrated that the utilization of face masks plays a critical role in limiting the outbreak. Healthcare professionals utilize masks all day long without replacing them very frequently, thus representing a source of cross&#8208;infection for patients and themselves. Nanotechnology is a powerful tool with the capability to produce nanomaterials with unique physicochemical and antipathogen properties. Here, how to realize non&#8208;disposable and highly comfortable respirators with light&#8208;triggered self&#8208;disinfection ability by bridging bioactive nanofiber properties and stimuli&#8208;responsive nanomaterials is outlined. The visionary road highlighted in this Concept is based on the possibility of developing a new generation of masks based on multifunctional membranes where the presence of nanoclusters and plasmonic nanoparticles arranged in a hierarchical structure enables the realization of a chemically driven and on&#8208;demand antipathogen activities. Multilayer electrospun membranes have the ability to dissipate humidity present within the mask, enhancing the wearability and usability. The photothermal disinfected membrane is the core of these 3D printed and reusable masks with moisture pump capability. Personalized face masks with smart nano&#8208;assisted destruction of pathogens will bring enormous advantages to the entire global community, especially for front&#8208;line personnel, and will open up great opportunities for innovative medical applications.

Here, how to realize non&#8208;disposable and highly comfortable respirators with light&#8208;triggered self&#8208;disinfection ability by bridging bioactive nanofiber properties and stimuli&#8208;responsive nanomaterials is outlined. The visionary road highlighted in this Concept is based on the possibility of developing a new generation of masks based on multifunctional membranes where the presence of nanoclusters and plasmonic nanoparticles arranged in a hierarchical structure enables the realization of a chemically driven and on&#8208;demand antipathogen activities. Multilayer electrospun membranes have the ability to dissipate humidity present within the mask, enhancing the wearability and usability. The photothermal disinfected membrane is the core of these 3D printed and reusable masks with moisture pump capability. Personalized face masks with smart nano&#8208;assisted destruction of pathogens will bring enormous advantages to the entire global community, especially for front&#8208;line personnel, and will open up great opportunities for innovative medical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>The Missing Parent Compound [(C5H5)Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)]: Synthesis, Characterization and Coordination Behavior</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The so far missing parent compound of the large family of pentaphosphaferrocenes [CpFe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] (1b) was synthesized by the thermolysis of [CpFe(CO)2]2 with P4 using the very high&#8208;boiling solvent diisopropylbenzene. It was comprehensively characterized by, inter alia, NMR spectroscopy, single crystal X&#8208;ray structure analysis, cyclic voltammetry and DFT computations. Moreover, its coordination behavior towards Cu(I) halides was explored, revealing the unprecedented 2D polymeric networks [{CpFe(&#951;5:1:1:1:1&#8208;P5)}Cu2(&#956;&#8208;X)2]n (2a: X = Cl, 2b: X = Br) and [{CpFe(&#951;5:1:1&#8208;P5)}Cu(&#956;&#8208;I)]n (3) and even the first cyclo&#8208;P5&#8208;containing 3D coordination polymer [{CpFe(&#951;5:1:1&#8208;P5)}Cu(&#956;&#8208;I)]n (4). The sandwich complex 1b can also be incorporated in nano&#8208;sized supramolecules based on [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] (1a) and CuX (X = Cl, Br, I): [CpFe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)]@[{Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)}12(CuX)20&#8208;n] (5a: X = Cl, n = 2.4; 5b: X = Br, n = 2.4; 5c: X = I, n = 0.95). Thereby, the formation of the CuI&#8208;containing fullerene&#8208;like sphere 5c is found for the first time.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyampholytic Graft Copolymers as Matrix for TiO2/Eosin Y/[Mo3S13]2&#8208; Hybrid Materials and Light&#8208;Driven Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An effective strategy to enhance the performance of inorganic semiconductors is moving towards organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid materials. Here, we report the design of core&#8208;shell hybrid materials based on a TiO  2  core functionalized with a polyampholytic (poly(dehydroalanine)&#8208;  graft  &#8208;(n&#8208;propyl phosphonic acid acrylamide) shell (PDha&#8208;  g  &#8208;PAA@TiO  2  ). The PDha&#8208;  g  &#8208;PAA shell facilitates the efficient immobilization of the photosensitizer Eosin Y (EY) and enables electronic interactions between EY and the TiO  2  core. This resulted in high visible light&#8208;driven H  2  generation. The enhanced light&#8208;driven catalytic activity is attributed to the unique core&#8208;shell design with the graft copolymer acting as bridge and facilitating electron and proton transfer, thereby also preventing the degradation of EY. Further catalytic enhancement of PDha&#8208;  g  &#8208;PAA@TiO  2  was possible by introducing [Mo  3  S  13  ]  2&#8208;  cluster anions as hydrogen evolution&#8208;cocatalyst. This novel design approach is one example for a multi&#8208;component system where reactivity can in future be independently tuned by selection of the desired molecular or polymeric species.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymorphs of the gadolinite&#8208;type borates ZrB2O5&#160;and HfB2O5&#160;under extreme pressure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Based on the results from previous high&#8208;pressure experiments on the gadolinite&#8208;type mineral datolite,&#160;CaBSiO4(OH), the behavior of the isostructural borates &#946;&#8209;HfB2O5&#160;and &#946;&#8209;ZrB2O5&#160;have been studied by synchrotron&#8208;based in situ high&#8208;pressure single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments. On compression to 120 GPa, both borate layer&#8208;structures are preserved. Additionally, at ~114&#160;GPa, the formation of a second phase can be observed in both compounds. The new high&#8208;pressure modification&#160;&#947;&#8209;ZrB2O5&#160;features a rearrangement of the corner&#8208;sharing BO4&#160;tetrahedra, while still maintaining the four&#8208; and eight&#8208;membered rings. The new phase&#160;&#947;&#8209;HfB2O5&#160;contains ten&#8208;membered rings including the rare structural motif of edge&#8208;sharing BO4&#160;tetrahedra with exceptionally short B&#8211;O and B&#183;&#183;&#183;B distances. For both structures, unusually high coordination numbers are found for the transition metal cations, with ninefold coordinated Hf4+, and tenfold coordinated Zr4+, respectively. These findings remarkably show the potential of cold compression as a low&#8208;energy pathway to discover metastable structures that exhibit new coordinations and structural motifs.</dc:description>

         <title>The Supramolecular Structural Chemistry of Pentafluorosulfanyl and Tetrafluorosulfanylene Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The analysis of crystal structures of SF  5  &#8208; or SF  4  &#8208;containing molecules revealed that these groups are often surrounded by hydrogen or other fluorine atoms. Even though fluorine prefers F&#183;&#183;&#183;H over F&#183;&#183;&#183;F contacts, the latter appeared to be important in many compounds. In a significant number of datasets, the closest F&#183;&#183;&#183;F contacts are below 95% of the van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals distance of two F atoms. Moreover, a number of repeating structural motifs formed by contacts between SF  5  groups was identified, including different supramolecular dimers and infinite chains. Among SF  4  &#8208;containing molecules, the study focused on SF  4  Cl compounds, including the first solid&#8208;state structure analyses of these reactive species. Additionally, electrostatic potential surfaces of a series of Ph&#8208;SF  5  derivatives were calculated, pointing out the substituent influence on the ability of F&#183;&#183;&#183;X contact formation (X = F or other electronegative atom). Interaction energies were calculated for different dimeric arrangements of Ph&#8208;SF  5  , which were extracted from experimental crystal structure determinations.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical Spin&#8208;Crossover Cooperativity in Hybrid 1&#8208;D Chains of FeII&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;trizole Trimers Linked by [Au(CN)2]&#8208; Bridges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Foremost, practical applications of spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) materials require control of the nature of the spin&#8208;state coupling. In existing SCO materials, there is a single, well&#8208;defined dimensionality relevant to the switching behavior. We show that a new material, consisting of 1,2,4&#8208;trizole&#8208;based trimers coordinated into 1&#8208;D chains by [Au(CN)2]&#8208; and spaced by anions and exchangeable guests, undergoes SCO defined by elastic coupling across multiple dimensional hierarchies. Detailed structural, vibrational, and theoretical studies conclusively confirm that intra&#8208;trimer coupling is an order of magnitude great than the intra&#8208;molecular coupling, which is an order of magnitude greater than inter&#8208;molecular coupling. As such, we have ascertained for the first time a clear hierarchy on the nature of elastic coupling in SCO materials, a necessary step for the technological development of molecular switching materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence for Achiral Metal Organic Colloids and the Guest Molecules in Vortex Field</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, scientists have reported a bunch of chiral fluorescence materials or chiral composites that could emit circularly polarized luminescence. Herein, two achiral metal&#8208;organic colloidal solutions were studied, showing active circularly polarized luminescence that observed in the vortex stirring. The absolute values for  g  lum  are 0.05 and 0.03 respectively. Plus or minus of  g  lum  depends on the colloidal structure and stirring direction, which make the property easily be manipulated. Further, host&#8208;guest interaction study suggests both electrostatic interaction and coordination bonding may influence the chiroptical property from colloidal solution to guest molecule. Rhodamine 6G and its carboxylic acid derivative exhibit good quantum yield and pretty well  g  lum  value in the colloidal solution.</dc:description>

         <title>Review The overview of N&#8208;rich antennae investigated in lanthanide&#8208;based temperature sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The market share of noncontact temperature sensors is expending due to fast technological and medical evolutions. In the wide variety of noncontact sensors, lanthanide&#8208;based temperature sensors stand out. They benefit from high photostability, relatively long decay times and high quantum yields. To circumvent their low molar light absorption, the incorporation of a light&#8208;harvesting antenna is required. This review provides an overview of the nitrogen&#8208;rich antennae in lanthanide&#8208;based temperature sensors, emitting in the visible light spectrum, and discuss their temperature sensor ability. The N&#8208;rich ligands are incorporated in many different platforms. The investigation of different antennae is required to develop temperature sensors with diverse optical properties and to create a diverse offer for the multiple application fields. First the molecular probes, consisting of small molecules, are discussed. Furthermore, the thermometer properties of ratiometric temperature sensors, based on di&#8208; and polynuclear complexes, metal&#8208;organic&#8208;frameworks, periodic mesoporous organosilicas and porous organic polymers, are summarized. The antenna mainly determines the application potential of the ratiometric thermometer. It can be observed that molecular probes are operational in the broad physiological range, metal&#8208;organic&#8208;frameworks are generally very useful in the cryogenic region, periodic mesoporous organosilica show temperature dependency in the physiological range and porous organic polymers are operative in the cryogenic to medium temperature range.</dc:description>

         <title>Naphthalenediimides with High Fluorescence Quantum Yield: Bright&#8208;Red, Stable and Responsive Fluorescent Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The naphthalenediimide (NDI) scaffold in contrast to its higher congeners possess low&#8208;fluorescence. In spite of elegant synthetic developments, a highly emissive NDI is quite rare to find, as well as, a green light emitting NDI is yet to be established. Herein we report a novel class of symmetric and asymmetric &#8211;NH2 substituted core&#8208;NDIs (1&#8208;5) with tunable fluorescence in the visible region and extending to the NIR frontier. Importantly, the bis&#8211;NH2 substituted NDI (2) revealed quantum yield, &#1060;f of ~81% and ~68% in toluene and DMSO, respectively, suggesting versatility of the fluorophore in a wide range of solvent polarity. The dye 1 is shown to be the first NDI&#8208;based green light emitter. The donor piperidine group in 5 diminish the &#1060;f by 40&#8208;fold providing a lever to modulate the ESIPT process. Our synthetic protocol applies Pd catalyst and a benign hydride source simplifying the non&#8208;trivial &#8211;NH2 group integration at NDI&#8208;core. TD&#8208;DFT calculations predicted strong intramolecular H&#8208;bonds in excited&#8208;state in the bulk nonpolar medium and responsiveness to solvent polarity. The maximization of the NDI emission outlined here would further boost the burgeoning repertoire of applications of the NDI scaffold.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8197;Situ Corrosion Fabrication of NaNbO3/Nb3O7F Heterojunctions with Optimized Band Realignment for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterojunctions: NaNbO3/Nb3O7F heterojunctions are fabricated through an in&#8197;situ corrosion technique for the first time. The influence of phase transformation on the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity is investigated systematically for photocatalytic water splitting for H2 production. Interestingly, the band realignment and good interfacial contact endow the NaNbO3/Nb3O7F heterojunctions with high HER activity.







Abstract
Heterostructured photocatalysis is a significant issue owing to the unique band alignment, improved spectrum absorption, and enhanced photocatalytic activity. However, the construction of uniform, controllable, and effective heterojunctions is still a huge challenge. Herein, NaNbO3/Nb3O7F heterojunctions are fabricated through an in&#8197;situ corrosion technique for the first time. The influence of phase transformation on the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity is investigated systematically in terms of photocatalytic water splitting for H2 production. Interestingly, the band realignment and good interfacial contact endow the NaNbO3/Nb3O7F heterojunctions with a high HER activity (43.3&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1), which is about 2.4&#8197;times that of pure Nb3O7F and 1.36&#8197;times that of pure NaNbO3. The results may provide some new insights into the corrosion technique and HER activity of novel heterostructured catalysts.

         <title>Extended Peptide Nucleic Acid Nucleobases Based on Isoorotic Acid for the Recognition of A&#8211;U Base Pairs in Double&#8208;Stranded RNA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a bind: Four new A&#8211;U binding nucleobases (Io1&#8211;Io4) are prepared and incorporated into peptide nucleic acids (PNA) for triple helical binding with double&#8208;stranded RNA. Io nucleobases show two times stronger Hoogsteen&#8208;hydrogen bonded triplets with A&#8211;U and similar selectivity compared to commonly used T*A&#8211;U triplets. Notably, strong binding is retained when four sequential Io4 residues are employed.







Abstract
Peptide nucleic acids (PNA) with extended isoorotamide containing nucleobases (Io) were designed for binding A&#8211;U base pairs in double&#8208;stranded RNA. Isothermal titration calorimetry and UV thermal melting experiments revealed improved affinity for A&#8211;U using the Io scaffold in PNA. PNAs having four sequential Io extended nucleobases maintained high binding affinity.

         <title>Tetryl&#8208;Tetrylene Addition to Phenylacetylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phenylacetylene adds [Ar*GeH2&#8208;SnAr&#8217;], [Ar*GeH2&#8208;PbAr&#8217;] and [Ar'SnH2&#8208;PbAr*] in a regioselective and stereoselective reaction. NMR chemical shifts of the olefins were investigated using two&#8208; and four&#8208;component relativistic DFT calculations, as spin&#8211;orbit effects can be large.

Abstract
Phenylacetylene adds [Ar*GeH2&#8208;SnAr&#8217;], [Ar*GeH2&#8208;PbAr&#8217;] and [Ar'SnH2&#8208;PbAr*] at rt in a regioselective and stereoselective reaction. The highest reactivity was found for the stannylene, which reacts immediately upon addition of one equivalent of alkyne. However, the plumbylenes exhibit addition to the alkyne only in reaction with an excess of phenylacetylene. The product of the germylplumbylene addition reacts with a second equivalent of alkyne and the product of a CH&#8208;activation, a dimeric lead acetylide, were isolated. In the case of the stannylplumbylene the trans&#8208;addition product was characterized as the kinetically controlled product which isomerizes at rt to yield the cis&#8208;addition product, which is stabilized by an intramolecular Sn&#8211;H&#8211;Pb interaction. NMR chemical shifts of the olefins were investigated using two&#8208; and four&#8208;component relativistic DFT calculations, as spin&#8211;orbit effects can be large. Hydride abstraction was carried out by treating [Ar'SnPhC=CHGeH2Ar*] with the trityl salt [Ph3C][Al(OC{CF3})4] to yield a four membered ring cation.

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure High&#8208;Temperature Synthesis of Mixed Nitridosilicatephosphates and Luminescence of AESiP3N7:Eu2+ (AE=Sr, Ba)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first nitridosilicatephosphates are synthesized using high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature reactions. The incorporation of P and Si as well as their occupational disorder in the compounds AESiP3N7 (AE=Sr, Ba) is proven by solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy, STEM&#8208;EDX mapping, and single&#8208;crystal diffraction. Eu2+&#8208;doped samples show blue luminescence under irradiation with UV light and therefore expand the range of possible host lattices for luminescent materials.







Abstract
Tetrahedra&#8208;based nitrides with network structures have emerged as versatile materials with a broad spectrum of properties and applications. Both nitridosilicates and nitridophosphates are well&#8208;known examples of such nitrides that upon doping with Eu2+ exhibit intriguing luminescence properties, which makes them attractive for applications. Nitridosilicates and nitridophosphates show manifold structural variability; however, no mixed nitridosilicatephosphates except SiPN3 and SiP2N4NH have been described so far. The compounds AESiP3N7 (AE=Sr, Ba) were synthesized by a high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature approach using the multianvil technique (8&#8197;GPa, 1400&#8211;1700&#8201;&#176;C) starting from the respective alkaline earth azides and the binary nitrides P3N5 and Si3N4. The latter were activated by NH4F, probably acting as a mineralizing agent. SrSiP3N7 and BaSiP3N7 were obtained as single crystals. They crystallized in the barylite&#8208;1O (M=Sr) and barylite&#8208;2O structure types (M=Ba), respectively, with P and Si being occupationally disordered. Cation disorder was further supported by solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping of BaSiP3N7 with atomic resolution. Upon doping with Eu2+, both compounds showed blue emission under UV excitation.

         <title>Replacing the Rhamnose&#8208;Xylose Moiety of QS&#8208;21 with Simpler Terminal Disaccharide Units Attenuates Adjuvant Activity in Truncated Saponin Variants</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shorter route to vaccine adjuvants: These multidisciplinary studies have provided streamlined access to new terminal disaccharide variants of truncated, QS&#8208;21 inspired saponin vaccine adjuvants through an expeditious synthetic route, and have identified a critical role for the native rhamnose&#8208;xylose moiety in adjuvant activity in connection with saponin conformation.







Abstract
Adjuvants are key immunostimulatory components in vaccine formulations, which improve the immune response to the co&#8208;administered antigen. The saponin natural product QS&#8208;21 is one of the most promising immunoadjuvants in the development of vaccines against cancer and infectious diseases but suffers from limitations that have hampered its widespread human use. Previous structure&#8211;activity relationship studies have identified simplified saponin variants with truncated carbohydrate chains, but have not focused on the influence of the linear oligosaccharide domain of QS&#8208;21 in adjuvant activity. Herein, an expeditious 15&#8208;step synthesis of new linear trisaccharide variants of simplified QS&#8208;21&#8208;derived adjuvants is reported, in which the complex terminal xylose&#8208;rhamnose moiety has been replaced with commercially available, simpler lactose and cellobiose disaccharides in a &#946;&#8208;anomeric configuration. In vivo immunological evaluation of the synthetic saponins showed attenuated antibody responses, highlighting the negative impact of such carbohydrate modifications on adjuvant activity, which could be associated with higher saponin conformational flexibility.

         <title>Chemodivergence between Electrophiles in Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In cross&#8208;coupling reactions, chemoselectivity becomes a concern when two or more (pseudo)halides are present in the substrates. This minireview surveys cases in which divergent chemoselectivity between electrophiles can be achieved under different reaction conditions. Particular emphasis is placed on discussing the possible mechanistic origins of selectivity control.







Abstract
Chemodivergent cross&#8208;couplings are those in which either one of two (or more) potentially reactive functional groups can be made to react based on choice of conditions. In particular, this review focuses on cross&#8208;couplings involving two different (pseudo)halides that can compete for the role of the electrophilic coupling partner. The discussion is primarily organized by pairs of electrophiles including chloride vs. triflate, bromide vs. triflate, chloride vs. tosylate, and halide vs. halide. Some common themes emerge regarding the origin of selectivity control. These include catalyst ligation state and solvent polarity or coordinating ability. However, in many cases, further systematic studies will be necessary to deconvolute the influences of metal identity, ligand, solvent, additives, nucleophilic coupling partner, and other factors on chemoselectivity.

Some common themes emerge regarding the origin of selectivity control. These include catalyst ligation state and solvent polarity or coordinating ability. However, in many cases, further systematic studies will be necessary to deconvolute the influences of metal identity, ligand, solvent, additives, nucleophilic coupling partner, and other factors on chemoselectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>(Trifluoromethylselenyl)methylchalcogenyl as emerging fluorinated groups: synthesis under photoredox catalysis and determination of the lipophilicity.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of molecules bearing (trifluoromethylselenyl)methylchalcogenyl groups is described via an efficient two&#8208;step strategy based on a metal&#8208;free photoredox catalyzed decarboxylative trifluoromethylselenolation with good yields up to 88% which raised to 98% in flow chemistry conditions. The flow methods allowed also to scale up the reaction. The mechanism of this key reaction was studied. The physico&#8208;chemical characterization of these emerging groups was performed by determining their Hansch&#8208;Leo lipophilicity parameters with high values up to 2.24. This reaction was also extended to perfluoroalkylselenolation with yields up to 95%. Finally, this method was successfully applied to the functionalization of relevant bioactive molecules such as tocopherol or estrone derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Cleavage of Cyclobutanols Through Ir&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;C Bond Activation: Mechanistic and Synthetic Aspects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iridium behaves differently! Unexpectedly, the Ir&#8208;catalyzed cleavage of cyclobutanols to give &#946;&#8208;chiral ketones proceeds through a different mechanism as compared to related Rh&#8208;catalyzed reactions. This was shown by deuteration experiments, kinetic isotope effect measurements and DFT calculations. The developed method for the catalytic enantioselective desymmetrization is of particular value in the synthesis of chromane&#8208;related natural products from readily accessible spirocyclobutanols.







Abstract
The Ir&#8208;catalyzed conversion of prochiral tert&#8208;cyclobutanols to &#946;&#8208;methyl&#8208;substituted ketones proceeds under comparably mild conditions in toluene (45&#8211;110&#8201;&#176;C) and is particularly suited for the enantioselective desymmetrization of &#946;&#8208;oxy&#8208;substituted substrates to give products with a quaternary chirality center with up to 95&#8201;% ee using DTBM&#8208;SegPhos as a chiral ligand. Deuteration experiments and kinetic isotope effect measurements revealed major mechanistic differences to related RhI&#8208;catalyzed transformations. Supported by DFT calculations we propose the initial formation of an IrIII hydride intermediate, which then undergoes a &#946;&#8208;C elimination (C&#8722;C bond activation) prior to reductive C&#8722;H elimination. The computational model also allows the prediction of the stereochemical outcome. The Ir&#8208;catalyzed cyclobutanol cleavage is broadly applicable but fails for substrates bearing strongly coordinating groups. The method is of particular value for the stereo&#8208;controlled synthesis of substituted chromanes related to the tocopherols and other natural products.

         <title>Photocatalyzed Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Oxidative Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions of Tetraorganoborates**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shining light on organoborates: A photocatalyzed oxidative cross&#8208;coupling reaction of functionalized organoborates is described, providing a diverse range of biaryl and olefin products. The mechanism of this C&#8722;C bond formation was investigated through quantum chemical calculations, revealing an unusual boracyclic intermediate.







Abstract
Readily accessible tetraorganoborate salts undergo selective coupling reactions under blue light irradiation in the presence of catalytic amounts of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free acridinium photocatalysts to furnish unsymmetrical biaryls, heterobiaryls and arylated olefins. This represents an interesting conceptual approach to forge C&#8722;C bonds between aryl, heteroaryl and alkenyl groups under smooth photochemical conditions. Computational studies were conducted to investigate the mechanism of the transformation.

Cascade reaction: The synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aryl amides through a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed 1,4&#8208;aryl migration/disulfonylation cascade applied to &#945;&#8208;bromo N&#8208;sulfonyl amides is reported.

Abstract
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed 1,4&#8208;aryl migration/disulfonylation cascade applied to &#945;&#8208;bromo N&#8208;sulfonyl amides was developed. The reaction was highly chemoselective, allowing the preparation of &#945;&#8208;aryl amides possessing a variety of functional groups. The method was used as the key step to synthesize an alkaloid, (&#177;)&#8208;deoxyeseroline. Mechanistic investigations suggest a radical process.

         <title>Synthesis and Electronic Properties of Directly Linked Dihydrodiazatetracene Dimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
5,12&#8208;Dihydro&#8208;5,12&#8208;diazatetracene (DHDAT) dimers with different substitution patterns are synthesized: a symmetric one with a C&#8722;C bond between the monomer units (1) and two asymmetric ones with a C&#8722;N bond between the monomer units (2 and 3). Compound 3 displays positive solvatochromism, characteristic for electron donor&#8211;acceptor molecules, despite its donor&#8211;donor type structure. Compound 3 also exhibits a unique multi&#8208;step thermochromic emission behavior. The emission behavior is attributed to the asymmetric distribution of HOMO and LUMO of DHDAT.







Abstract
5,12&#8208;Dihydro&#8208;5,12&#8208;diazatetracene (DHDAT) dimers with different substitution patterns are synthesized: a symmetric one with a C&#8722;C bond between the monomer units (1) and two asymmetric ones with a C&#8722;N bond between the monomer units (2 and 3). The DHDAT units are planar in the C&#8722;C linked dimer 1 but perpendicularly oriented in the C&#8722;N linked dimers 2 and 3 (from X&#8208;ray analysis). The electronic ground&#8208;state interaction between the two units is large in 1 and small in 2 and 3. The emission behavior of 3 is different from that of other dimers and its monomer; it displays positive solvatochromism, characteristic for electron donor&#8211;acceptor molecules, despite its donor&#8211;donor type structure. Compound 3 exhibits a unique multi&#8208;step thermochromic emission behavior. The emission behavior is attributed to the asymmetric distribution of the HOMO and LUMO of DHDAT.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5,12&#8208;Dihydro&#8208;5,12&#8208;diazatetracene&lt;/b&gt; (DHDAT) dimers with different substitution patterns are synthesized: a symmetric one with a C&#8722;C bond between the monomer units (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) and two asymmetric ones with a C&#8722;N bond between the monomer units (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;). Compound &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; displays positive solvatochromism, characteristic for electron donor&#8211;acceptor molecules, despite its donor&#8211;donor type structure. Compound &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; also exhibits a unique multi&#8208;step thermochromic emission behavior. The emission behavior is attributed to the asymmetric distribution of HOMO and LUMO of DHDAT.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5,12&#8208;Dihydro&#8208;5,12&#8208;diazatetracene (DHDAT) dimers with different substitution patterns are synthesized: a symmetric one with a C&#8722;C bond between the monomer units (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) and two asymmetric ones with a C&#8722;N bond between the monomer units (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;). The DHDAT units are planar in the C&#8722;C linked dimer &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; but perpendicularly oriented in the C&#8722;N linked dimers &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; (from X&#8208;ray analysis). The electronic ground&#8208;state interaction between the two units is large in &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and small in &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;. The emission behavior of &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; is different from that of other dimers and its monomer; it displays positive solvatochromism, characteristic for electron donor&#8211;acceptor molecules, despite its donor&#8211;donor type structure. Compound &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; exhibits a unique multi&#8208;step thermochromic emission behavior.

         <dc:description>
Redox chemistry with bismuth: Snapshots of the redox chemistry of heavy p&#8208;block elements are difficult to obtain and remain rare to date. This work demonstrates that redox&#8208;active ligands in the coordination sphere of bismuth facilitate well&#8208;behaved one&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer reactions according to cyclic voltammetry. The charge of the complexes (neutral vs. cationic) allows the spin density to shift either towards the ligand or towards the metal center. More information can be found in the Full Paper by C. Lichtenberg et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202005186).

         <title>Ni2P Nanoalloy as an Air&#8208;Stable and Versatile Hydrogenation Catalyst in Water: P&#8208;Alloying Strategy for Designing Smart Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Air&#8208;stable non&#8208;noble metal nanoparticles: A novel nickel phosphide nanoalloy (nano&#8208;Ni2P) retained its metallic nature in air and exhibited a high activity for the hydrogenation of carbonyls, nitriles, and nitroarenes in water. The used nano&#8208;Ni2P could be easily handled and reused without pretreatment, providing a simple and clean catalyst system for general hydrogenation reactions.







Abstract
Non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based hydrogenation catalysts have limited practical applications because they exhibit low activity, require harsh reaction conditions, and are unstable in air. To overcome these limitations, herein we propose the alloying of non&#8208;noble metal nanoparticles with phosphorus as a promising strategy for developing smart catalysts that exhibit both excellent activity and air stability. We synthesized a novel nickel phosphide nanoalloy (nano&#8208;Ni2P) with coordinatively unsaturated Ni active sites. Unlike conventional air&#8208;unstable non&#8208;noble metal catalysts, nano&#8208;Ni2P retained its metallic nature in air, and exhibited a high activity for the hydrogenation of various substrates with polar functional groups, such as aldehydes, ketones, nitriles, and nitroarenes to the desired products in excellent yields in water. Furthermore, the used nano&#8208;Ni2P catalyst was easy to handle in air and could be reused without pretreatment, providing a simple and clean catalyst system for general hydrogenation reactions.

         <title>Sb6O7(SO4)2: A Promising Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Material with an Enhanced Second&#8208;Harmonic&#8208;Generation Response Activated by SbIII Lone&#8208;Pair Stereoactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing the stereoactive lone pair cation of SbIII into sulfates, an anhydrous sulfate of Sb6O7(SO4)2 is achieved. Sb3+ cations are in seesaw configurations and in&#8208;phase aligned in a three&#8208;dimensional asymmetric dense structure. The material exhibits an enhanced phase&#8208;matching second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation response, a moderate birefringence, a wide transparency window and considerable environmental stabilities, which endow it a promising UV nonlinear optical material. Theoretical studies reveal that the functional SbIII with stereochemical active lone pair makes predominant contribution to the enhanced effect. More information can be found in the Communication by X.&#8208;T. An, G.&#8208;M. Wang, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202004859).

         <title>Tuning the Molecular Packing of Self&#8208;Assembled Amphiphilic PtII Complexes by Varying the Hydrophilic Side&#8208;Chain Length</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
X&#8208;ray diffraction and advanced solid&#8208;state NMR studies were combined as a new, general tool for detailed structural and supramolecular elucidation, using a series of amphiphilic PtII complexes as model compounds. Our approach provides an alternative for supramolecular systems where single&#8208;crystal growth is not possible, which can be potentially applied to many other molecular and macromolecular platforms.







Abstract
Understanding the relationship between molecular design and packing modes constitutes one of the major challenges in self&#8208;assembly and is essential for the preparation of functional materials. Herein, we have achieved high precision control over the supramolecular packing of amphiphilic PtII complexes by systematic variation of the hydrophilic side&#8208;chain length. A novel approach of general applicability based on complementary X&#8208;ray diffraction and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy has allowed us to establish a clear correlation between molecular features and supramolecular ordering. Systematically increasing the side&#8208;chain length gradually increases the steric demand and reduces the extent of aromatic interactions, thereby inducing a gradual shift in the molecular packing from parallel to a long&#8208;slipped organization. Notably, our findings highlight the necessity of advanced solid&#8208;state NMR techniques to gain structural information for supramolecular systems where single&#8208;crystal growth is not possible. Our work further demonstrates a new molecular design strategy to modulate aromatic interaction strengths and packing arrangements that could be useful for the engineering of functional materials based on PtII and aromatic molecules.

         <title>Amorphous Boron Dispersed in LaCoO3 with Large Oxygen Vacancies for Efficient Catalytic Propane Oxidation</title>

Boron&#8208;induced oxygen defects: Unsatisfactory oxygen mobility is a barrier to the development of perovskites for low&#8208;temperature volatile organic compound oxidation. This work introduces small amounts of dispersed non&#8208;metal boron into the LaCoO3 crystal through an easy sol&#8208;gel method to create more oxygen defects. The resulting Co3+ rich surface and large oxygen vacancies realized with the amorphous boron dispersed in LaCoO3 shows efficient propane oxidation activity.







Abstract
Unsatisfactory oxygen mobility is a considerable barrier to the development of perovskites for low&#8208;temperature volatile organic compounds (VOCs) oxidation. This work introduced small amounts of dispersed non&#8208;metal boron into the LaCoO3 crystal through an easy sol&#8208;gel method to create more oxygen defects, which are conducive to the catalytic performance of propane (C3H8) oxidation. It reveals that moderate addition of boron successfully induces a high distortion of the LaCoO3 crystal, decreases the perovskite particle size, and produces a large proportion of bulk Co2+ species corresponding to abundant oxygen vacancies. Additionally, surface Co3+ species, as the acid sites, which are active for cleaving the C&#8722;H bonds of C3H8 molecules, are enriched. As a result, the LCB&#8208;7 (molar ratio of Co/B=0.93:0.07) displays the best C3H8 oxidation activity. Simultaneously, the above catalyst exhibits superior thermal stability against CO2 and H2O, lasting 200&#8197;h. This work provides a new strategy for modifying the catalytic VOCs oxidation performance of perovskites by the regulation of amorphous boron dispersion.

&lt;p&gt;Unsatisfactory oxygen mobility is a considerable barrier to the development of perovskites for low&#8208;temperature volatile organic compounds (VOCs) oxidation. This work introduced small amounts of dispersed non&#8208;metal boron into the LaCoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; crystal through an easy sol&#8208;gel method to create more oxygen defects, which are conducive to the catalytic performance of propane (C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) oxidation. It reveals that moderate addition of boron successfully induces a high distortion of the LaCoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; crystal, decreases the perovskite particle size, and produces a large proportion of bulk Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; species corresponding to abundant oxygen vacancies. Additionally, surface Co&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; species, as the acid sites, which are active for cleaving the C&#8722;H bonds of C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; molecules, are enriched. As a result, the LCB&#8208;7 (molar ratio of Co/B=0.93:0.07) displays the best C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; oxidation activity. Simultaneously, the above catalyst exhibits superior thermal stability against CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, lasting 200&#8197;h. This work provides a new strategy for modifying the catalytic VOCs oxidation performance of perovskites by the regulation of amorphous boron dispersion.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Fluorescent Imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrimidine Compounds as Biocompatible Organic Photosensitizers that Generate Singlet Oxygen: A Potential Tool for Phototheranostics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent tetracyclic imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyri(mi)dines can be generated by microwave&#8208;assisted high order (8+2) thermal cycloadditions between in situ formed benzynes and the corresponding bicyclic imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyr(im)idines. These cycloadducts absorb and emit photons in the 400&#8208;500 nm region and are efficiently uptaken by cells with low cytotoxicity. Upon irradiation, these molecules generate singlet oxygen and are able to kill cancer cells at low concentration, thus emerging as promising candidates for photodynamic therapy and fluorescence imaging. .

         <title>Isomers of B&#8592;N&#8208;Fused Dibenzo&#8208;azaacenes: How B&#8592;N Affects Opto&#8208;electronic Properties and Device Behaviors?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three dibenzo&#8208;azaacenes were synthesized in which two B&#8592;N units were introduced at different positions. They showed significantly different opto&#8208;electronic properties and device performance.







Abstract
The B&#8592;N unit has a large dipole and it is isoelectronic to C&#8722;C moiety with no dipole. Incorporating B&#8592;N units into &#960;&#8208;conjugated system is a powerful strategy to design organic small molecules and polymers with intriguing opto&#8208;electronic properties and excellent opto&#8208;electronic device performance. However, it is unclear how the B&#8592;N unit affects electronic structures and opto&#8208;electronic properties of large &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules. In this work, to address this question, we developed three dibenzo&#8208;azaacene molecules in which two B&#8592;N units were introduced at different positions. Although the dibenzo&#8208;azaacene skeleton is fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated, the effect of B&#8592;N unit on the electronic structures of the adjacent rings is much stronger than that of the distant rings. As a result, the three molecules with isomerized B&#8592;N incorporation patterns possess different electronic structures and exhibit tunable opto&#8208;electronic properties. Among the three molecules, the centrosymmetrical molecule exhibits higher LUMO/HOMO energy levels than those of the two axisymmetrical molecules. When used as the active layer in organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs), while the two axisymmetrical molecules show unipolar electron transporting property, the centrosymmetrical molecule exhibits ambipolar hole and electron transporting behavior. This work not only deepens our understanding on organoboron &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules, but also indicates a new strategy to tune opto&#8208;electronic properties of organic semiconductors for excellent device performance.

         <title>Parallel Lipid Peroxide Accumulation Strategy Based on Bimetal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Ferrotherapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Framework for ferroptosis: A parallel lipid peroxide accumulation strategy has been designed based on a drug&#8208;sandwiched metal&#8211;organic framework (EsMOF) for enhanced ferrotherapy. The catalytic MOF can initiate dual Fenton reactions to generate abundant .OH. Through MOF&#8208;catalyzed .OH generation and GSH depletion&#8208;inactive GPX4, the catalytic nanomedicine can effectively inhibit tumor growth, opening up new opportunities to treat apoptosis&#8208;insensitive tumors.







Abstract
Ferroptosis, a nonapoptotic cell&#8208;death pathway, is commonly regulated by ether lipid peroxide generation or glutathione consumption. In this work, a parallel lipid peroxide accumulation strategy was designed based on catalytic metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) for enhanced ferrotherapy. The bimetallic MOF was synthesized with iron porphyrin as a linker and cupric ion as a metal node, and erastin, a ferroptosis inducer, was sandwiched between the MOF layers with 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dipyridyl disulfide as spacers. In a tumor microenvironment, erastin was released from the layered MOFs through glutathione&#8208;responsive cleavage. The exfoliated MOFs served as a dual Fenton reaction inducer to generate numerous hydroxyl radicals for the accumulation of lipid peroxide, while erastin&#8208;aggravated glutathione depletion down&#8208;regulated glutathione peroxidase 4; this then inhibited the consumption of lipid peroxide. Therefore, a parallel lipid peroxide accumulation strategy was established for enhanced ferrotherapy that effectively inhibited tumor growth in live mice, opening up new opportunities to treat apoptosis&#8208;insensitive tumors.

         <title>Recent Advances in Enantioselective Desymmetrizations of Prochiral Oxetanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Prochiral oxetanes are excellent candidates for the synthesis of chiral alcohols and ethers via enantioselective desymmetrization. Recent methods relying on transition metal, Lewis acid, and Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis allow access to a remarkably diverse set of compounds, which are highlighted and put into context.







Abstract
Strain relief of oxetanes offers a plethora of opportunities for the synthesis of chiral alcohols and ethers. In this context, enantioselective desymmetrization has been identified as a powerful tool to construct molecular complexity and this has led to the development of elegant strategies on the basis of transition metal, Lewis acid, and Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis. This review highlights recent examples that harness the inherent reactivity of prochiral oxetanes and offers an outlook on the immense possibilities for synthetic application.

         <title>A General Approach to Intermolecular Olefin Hydroacylation through Light&#8208;Induced HAT Initiation: An Efficient Synthesis of Long&#8208;Chain Aliphatic Ketones and Functionalized Fatty Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trying out a new HAT: An efficient light&#8208;induced HAT process for the radical intermolecular hydroacylation of unactivated substrates allows the synthesis of a large number of long&#8208;chain aliphatic ketones containing numerous synthetically valuable functional groups in good yields. The results obtained in a series of studies indicate a radical chain mechanism for the hydroacylation process.







Abstract
Herein, an operationally simple, environmentally benign and effective method for intermolecular radical hydroacylation of unactivated substrates by employing photo&#8208;induced hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) initiation is described. The use of commercially available and inexpensive photoinitiators (Ph2CO and NHPI) makes the process attractive. The olefin hydroacylation protocol applies to a wide array of substrates bearing numerous functional groups and many complex structural units. The reaction proves to be scalable (up to 5&#8197;g). Different functionalized fatty acids, petrochemicals and naturally occurring alkanes can be synthesized with this protocol. A radical chain mechanism is implicated in the process.

         <title>The long and bright path of a lanthanide MOF: from the basics towards the application.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of portable, reliable, and low&#8208;cost sensors for assessing the quality of natural water sources is of high relevance in developing countries as they can serve as an intermediate solution prior to the building of permanent potable water distribution infrastructure. These sensors should be simple to operate by non&#8208;trained operators and easy to manufacture locally. Lanthanide&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) offer a trustable platform due to their intense emission in regions of the visible spectra and their high sensitivity to fluorides in water. We chose cotton as a substrate due to its high hydrophilicity, which together with the highly porous nature of the MOF, allows for shorter reaction times. The modified cotton was characterized by XRD, SEM as well as XAFS, hence probing the presence of [Tb(BTC)6(H2O)] (Tb&#8208;BTC) attachment to cotton. Changes in the emission when Tb&#8208;BTC modified cotton was exposed to water and aqueous fluoride solutions were monitored as a function of time. We identified crystalline phase changes that correlated to structural information. Finally, we used the Tb&#8208;BTC modified cotton to build a fluoride demonstrator sensor with a linear response up to 10ppm and 0.8ppm detection limit making it suitable for drinking water analysis under international regulations.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in the Synthesis of Glycodendrimers with Antiviral and Antibacterial Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycodendrimers are an important class of synthetic macromolecules that can be used to mimic many structural and functional features of cell surface glycoconjugates. Their carbohydrate moieties perform key important functions in bacterial and viral infections, often regulated by carbohydrate&#8211;protein interactions. Several studies have shown that the molecular structure, the valency and spatial organization of carbohydrate epitopes in glycoconjugates are key factors in the specificity and avidity of carbohydrate&#8208;protein interactions. Choosing the right glycodendrimers almost always helps to interfere in such interactions and blocks bacteria o viral adhesion or entry into host cells as an effective strategy to inhibit bacterial or viral infections. In this review, we describe the state of the art in the design and synthesis of glycodendrimers employed for the development of anti&#8208;adhesion therapy against bacterial and viral infections.Glycodendrimers are an important class of synthetic macromolecules that can be used to mimic many structural and functional features of cell surface glycoconjugates. Their carbohydrate moieties perform key important functions in bacterial and viral infections, often regulated by carbohydrate&#8211;protein interactions. Several studies have shown that the molecular structure, the valency and spatial organization of carbohydrate epitopes in glycoconjugates are key factors in the specificity and avidity of carbohydrate&#8208;protein interactions.

         <dc:description>Our efforts in the chemistry of gold complexes featuring ambiphilic phosphine&#8208;carbenium L/Z&#8208;type ligand have led us to consider the reduction of the carbenium moiety as a means to modulate the gold&#8208;carbenium interaction present in these complexes.&#160; Here, we show that the one&#8208;electron reduction of [( o &#8208;Ph 2 P(C 6 H 4 )Acr)AuCl] + (Acr = 9&#8208; N &#8208;methylacridinium) produces a neutral stable radical, the structure of which shows a marked increase in the Au &#8211; Acr distance.&#160; Related structural changes are observed for the phosphine oxide analog [( o &#8208;Ph 2 P(O)(C 6 H 4 )Acr] + , the reduction of which also interferes with the P=O &#8211; carbenium interaction.&#160; These structural effects, driven by a reduction&#8208;induced change in the electrostatic potential profile of the compounds, show that the charge and accepting properties of the carbenium unit can be modulated.&#160; These results highlight the redox&#8208;noninnocence of carbenium Z&#8208;type ligand, a feature that can be exploited to induce specific conformational changes.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of weak bases and mild conditions is currently the most sustainable and attractive synthetic approach for the preparation of Late&#8208;Transition metal complexes, some of which are widely used in catalysis, medicinal chemistry and material sciences. Herein, we report the first examples of the use of continuous flow reactors for the preparation of Cu(I), Au(I) and Pd(II)&#8208;NHC complexes using as starting materials cuprate, aurate or palladate species and a microreactor containing a weak base, K 2 CO 3&#160; . All reactions examined proceed under extremely mild conditions and make use of technical grade acetone as solvent. The scalability of the process was exemplified in a multigram&#8208;scale synthesis of [Cu(IPr)Cl].</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
A series of color&#8208;shifted fluorogenic ligands for FAST protein without compromise to the binding efficiency and the utility for live&#8208;cell protein labeling are presented. This study highlights the potential of benzylidene imidazolones derivatives for rapid expansion of live&#8208;cell fluorogenic labeling tools.







Abstract
Using benzylidene imidazolone core, we created a panel of color&#8208;shifted fluorogenic ligands for FAST protein without compromise to the binding efficiency and the utility for live&#8208;cell protein labeling. This study highlights the potential of benzylidene imidazolones derivatives for rapid expansion of a pallet of live&#8208;cell fluorogenic labeling tools.

A look at structure: The synthesis and characterization of a hetero&#8208;dinuclear compound is presented, in which a copper(I) trishistidine type coordination unit is positioned directly above a zinc porphyrin unit. The close distance between the two coordination fragments is secured by a rigid xanthene backbone, and a unique (intramolecular) copper porphyrin&#8208;&#960;&#8208;bond is determined for the first time in the molecular structure.

The close distance between the two coordination fragments is secured by a rigid xanthene backbone, and a unique (intramolecular) copper porphyrin&#8208;&#960;&#8208;bond was determined for the first time in the molecular structure. This structural motif was further analyzed by temperature&#8208;dependent NMR studies: In solution at room temperature the coordinative bond fluctuates, while it can be frozen at low temperatures. Preliminary reactivity studies revealed a reduced reactivity of the copper(I) moiety towards dioxygen. The results adumbrate why nature is avoiding metal porphyrin&#8208;&#960;&#8208;bonds by fixing reactive metal centers in a predetermined distance to each other within multimetallic enzymatic reaction centers.

The spirocyclic hypervalent iodine reagents containing 4&#8208;oxazolidinone ring are prepared via a (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition of azaoxyallyl cations with ethynylbenziodoxolones. They display satisfactory stability and solubility in organic solvents. Using them as precursors, both 4,1&#8208;benzoxazepine&#8208;2,5&#8208;diones and 1,3&#8208;diynes derivatives were afforded in one&#8208;pot under copper (I)&#8208;catalyzed conditions.







Abstract
Herein, a [3+2] cycloaddition of aza&#8208;oxyallylic cations with ethynylbenziodoxolones for synthesis of new &#955;3&#8208;iodanes containing spirocyclic 4&#8208;oxazolidinone has been developed. This cyclic &#955;3&#8208;iodanes display stability in air and excellent solubility in organic solvent. Using them as substrate, both the 4,1&#8208;benzoxazepine&#8208;2,5&#8208;diones and symmetrical 1,3&#8208;diynes derivatives were afforded in high yield under copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed conditions.

In this study, new fucosylation inhibitors based on fluorination of fucose&#8208;1&#8208;phosphates were developed. Inhibitors A2FF1P and B2FF1P are potent, specific, non&#8208;toxic, inhibit fucosylation for multiple days and have a known mechanism of action. These new tools will help study the role of fucosylation in health and disease and are potential therapeutic candidates.







Abstract
Fucosylation of glycans impacts a myriad of physiological and pathological processes. Inhibition of fucose expression emerges as a potential therapeutic avenue for example in cancer, inflammation, and infection. In this study, we found that protected 2&#8208;fluorofucose 1&#8208;phosphate efficiently inhibits cellular fucosylation with a four to seven times higher potency than known inhibitor 2FF, independently of the anomeric stereochemistry. Nucleotide sugar analysis revealed that both the &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;GDP&#8208;2FF anomers are formed inside the cell. In conclusion, we developed A2FF1P and B2FF1P as potent new tools for studying the role of fucosylation in health and disease and they are potential therapeutic candidates.

         <title>Enantiopure Calcium Iminophosphonamide Complexes: Synthesis, Photoluminescence, and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glowing bones: Enantiopure homoleptic iminophosphonamide calcium complexes have been prepared. These show rich photoluminescence properties and catalytic activity in the hydroboration of ketones.







Abstract
The synthesis of calcium complexes ligated by three different chiral iminophosphonamide ligands, L&#8208;H (L=[Ph2P{N(R)CH(CH3)Ph}2]), L&#8242;&#8208;H (L&#8242;=[Ph2P{NDipp}{N(R)CH(CH3)Ph}]), (Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3), and L&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;H (L&#8242;&#8242;=[Ph2P{N(R)CH(CH3)naph}2]), (naph=naphthyl) is presented. The resulting structures [L2Ca], [L&#8242;2Ca], and [L&#8242;&#8242;2Ca] represent the first examples of enantiopure homoleptic calcium complexes based on this type of ligands. The calcium complexes show blue&#8211;green photoluminescence (PL) in the solid state, which is especially bright at low temperatures. Whereas the emission of [L&#8242;&#8242;2Ca] is assigned to the fluorescence of naphthyl groups, the PL of [L2Ca] and [L&#8242;2Ca] is contributed by long&#8208;lived phosphorescence and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), with a strong variation of the PL lifetimes over the temperature range of 5&#8211;295&#8197;K. Furthermore, an excellent catalytic activity was found for these complexes in hydroboration of ketones at room temperature, although no enantioselectivity was achieved.

         <title>Isoindolinone Synthesis via One&#8208;Pot Type Transition Metal Catalyzed C&#8722;C Bond Forming Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isoindolinone motif can found in a large variety biologically and pharmaceutically active compounds. Due to the central role in a number of applications, the synthetic methodologies for accessing this heterocyclic skeleton have received significant attention during the past decade. Herein, the recent advances (2010&#8211;2020) in transition metal catalyzed synthetic methodologies via formation of new C&#8722;C bonds for isoindolinones are reviewed.







Abstract
Isoindolinone structure is an important privileged scaffold found in a large variety of naturally occurring as well as synthetic, biologically and pharmaceutically active compounds. Owing to its crucial role in a number of applications, the synthetic methodologies for accessing this heterocyclic skeleton have received significant attention during the past decade. In general, the synthetic strategies can be divided into two categories: First, direct utilization of phthalimides or phthalimidines as starting materials for the synthesis of isoindolinones; and second, construction of the lactam and/or aromatic rings by different catalytic methods, including C&#8722;H activation, cross&#8208;coupling, carbonylation, condensation, addition and formal cycloaddition reactions. Especially in the last mentioned, utilization of transition metal catalysts provides access to a broad range of substituted isoindolinones. Herein, the recent advances (2010&#8211;2020) in transition metal catalyzed synthetic methodologies via formation of new C&#8722;C bonds for isoindolinones are reviewed.

         <title>Optical Characteristics of Hybrid Macrocycles with Dithienogermole and Tricoordinate Boron Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unconventional elements: New macrocyclic compounds containing tricoordinate boron and germanium show characteristic fluoride responses in their optical properties, depending on their structures. This indicates that the element&#8208;hybrid macrocyclic system is promising as a new class of fluoride sensor material.







Abstract
The introduction of unconventional elements into &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems has been studied to manipulate the electronic states and properties of compounds. Herein, boron&#8208; and germanium&#8208;containing hybrid macrocycles, as a new class of element&#8208;hybrid conjugated systems, have been synthesized. The palladium&#8208;catalyzed Stille cross coupling of bis(bromothienyl)borane and bis(trimethylstannylthienyl)&#8208; or bis(trimethylstannylphenyl)&#8208;substituted dithienogermoles as the boron&#8208; and germanium&#8208;containing building blocks, respectively, produced a mixture of several macrocyclic compounds. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis of the 2:2 coupling product revealed a planar structure with a cavity inside the macrocycle. The optical properties of the macrocyclic products indicated rather small electronic interactions between the building units. However, intramolecular photoenergy transfer from the dithienogermole unit to the boron unit was clearly observed with respect to the fluorescence spectra.

         <title>Additive&#8208;free Aqueous Dispersions of Two&#8208;Dimensional Materials&#160;with Glial Cell Compatibility and Enzymatic&#160;Degradability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water&#8208;dispersible two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials are desirable for diverse applications. Aqueous dispersions make processing safer and greener, and enable evaluation of these materials on biological and environmental fronts. To evaluate the effects of 2D materials with biological systems, obtaining dispersions without additives is critical and has been a challenge. Herein, we developed a method for obtaining additive&#8208;free aqueous dispersions of 2D materials like transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN). The nanosheet dispersions are investigated through spectroscopic and microscopic methods, along with the role of size on stability. The aqueous media enabled investigations on cytocompatibility and enzymatic degradation of molybdenum disulphide (MoS  2  ) and h&#8208;BN. Cytocompatibility with mixed glial cells is observed up to concentrations of 100 &#956;g ml  &#8208;1  , suggesting their plausible usage in bioelectronics. Besides, biodegradation using human myeloperoxidase (hMPO) mediated catalysis is investigated through Raman spectroscopy and electron microscopy. The findings suggest that additive&#8208;free 2H&#8208;MoS  2  and h&#8208;BN are degradable by hMPO, with 2H&#8208;phase exhibiting better resistance to degradation than the 1T&#8208;phase, while h&#8208;BN exhibits slower degradation. The findings pave a path for incorporating 2D materials in the burgeoning field of transient bioelectronics.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A highly strained covalent organic cage compound was synthesized from hexahydroxy tribenzotriquinacene (TBTQ) and a&#160;  meta  &#8208;terphenyl&#8208;based diboronic acid with an additional benzoic acid substituent in 2&#8217;&#8208;position. Usually, a 120&#176; bite angle in the unsubstituted ditopic linker favors the formation of a [4+6] cage assembly. Here we show that introduction of the benzoic acid group leads to a perfectly preorganized circular hydrogen&#8208;bonding array in the cavity of a trigonal&#8208;bipyramidal [2+3] cage, which energetically overcompensates the additional strain energy caused by the larger mismatch in bite angles for the smaller assembly. The strained cage compound was analyzed by mass spectrometry and&#160;  1  H,&#160;  13  C and DOSY NMR spectroscopy. DFT calculations revealed the energetic contribution of the hydrogen&#8208;bonding template to the cage stability. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations on early intermediates indicate an additional kinetic effect, as hydrogen&#8208;bonding also preorganizes and rigidifies small oligomers to facilitate the exclusive formation of smaller and more strained macrocycles and cages.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable Light Emission Properties of Solution&#8208;Processable N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Cyclometalated Gold(III) Complexes for Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) cyclometalated gold(III) complexes remain very scarce and therefore their photophysical properties remain currently underexplored. Moreover, gold(III) complexes emitting in the blue region of the electromagnetic spectrum are rare. In this work, a series of four phosphorescent gold(III) complexes were investigated bearing four different NHC monocyclometalated (C^C*)&#8208;type ligands and a dianionic (N^N)&#8208;type ancillary ligand ((N^N) = 5,5&#8217;&#8208;(propane&#8208;2,2&#8208;diyl)bis(3&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazole) (mepzH2)). The complexes exhibit strong phosphorescence when doped in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) at room temperature, which were systematically tuned from sky&#8208;blue [&#955;PL = 456 nm, CIE coordinates: (0.20, 034)] to green [&#955;PL = 516 nm, CIE coordinates: (0.31, 0.54)] by varying the monocyclometalated (C^C*) ligand framework. The complexes revealed high quantum efficiencies (&#981;PL) of up to 43% and excited&#8208;state lifetimes (&#964;0) between 15&#8211;266 &#956;s. The radiative rate constant values found for these complexes (kr = 103&#8211;104 s&#8211;1) are the highest found in comparison to previously known best performing monocyclometalated gold(III) complexes. Density functional theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent DFT (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations of these complexes further lend support to the excited state nature of these complexes.&#160;Additionally, organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) were fabricated using solution&#8208;process to provide the first insight into the electroluminescent (EL) properties of this new class of gold(III) complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing the local reaction environment during high turnover carbon dioxide reduction with Ag&#8208;based gas diffusion electrodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Discerning the influence of electrochemical reactions on the electrode microenvironment is an unavoidable topic for electro&#173;chemical reactions that involve the production of OH &#8208; and the con&#173;sumption of water. That is particularly true for the carbon dioxide re&#173;duction reaction (CO 2 RR) which together with the competing hydro&#173;gen evolution reaction exert changes in the local OH &#8208; and H 2 O activi&#173;ty which in turn can possibly affect activity, stability and selectivity of the CO 2 RR. We determine the local OH &#8208; and H 2 O activity in close proximity to a CO 2 converting Ag&#8208;based gas diffusion electrode (GDE) with product analysis using gas chromatography. A Pt&#8208;nano&#173;sensor is positioned in the vicinity of the working GDE using shear&#173;force&#8208;based scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) approach curves allowing to monitor changes invoked by reactions proceeding within an otherwise inaccessible porous GDE by potentiodynamic measurements at the Pt&#8208;tip nanosensor. We show that high turnover HER/CO 2 RR at a GDE lead to modulations of the alkalinity of the local electrolyte, that resemble a 16&#160;M KOH solution, variations which are in turn linked to the reaction selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Optically Controlled Electron Transfer in a Re(I) Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate ultrafast optical control of intramolecular charge flow which paves the way for photocurrent modulation and switching with a highly wavelength&#8208;selective ON/OFF ratio. The system we explore is a&#160;  fac  &#8208; [ Re(CO)  3  (TTF&#8208;DPPZ)Cl ] &#160;complexe, where TTF&#8208;DPPZ = 4&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;bis(propylthio)tetrathiafulvenyl[  i  ]dipyrido[3,2&#8208;  a  :2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;  c  ]phenazine. DFT calculations and AC&#8208;Stark spectroscopy confirm the presence of two distinct optically active charge&#8208;transfer processes, namely a metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT) and an intra&#8208;ligand charge transfer (ILCT). Ultrafast transient absorption measurements show that the ILCT state decays in the ps regime. Upon excitation to the MLCT state, only a long&#8208;lived&#160;  3  MLCT state is observed after 80 ps. Remarkably, however, the bleaching of the ILCT absorption band remains as a result of the effective inhibition of the HOMO&#8208;LUMO transition</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;functional, Low Symmetry Pd2L4 Nanocage Libraries**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Symmetry is over: A family of functionalised, asymmetric ditopic ligands was synthesised from a common precursor. Each ligand was capable of self&#8208;assembling with PdII ions to selectively form low&#8208;symmetry cis&#8208;Pd2L4 nanocages. Due to the isostructural nature of the ligand framework, multiple ligands were able to be combined to generate combinatorial libraries containing heteroleptic, multi&#8208;functional, low symmetry nanocages.







Abstract
Although many impressive metallo&#8208;supramolecular architectures have been reported, they tend towards high symmetry structures and avoid extraneous functionality to ensure high fidelity in the self&#8208;assembly process. This minimalist approach, however, limits the range of accessible structures and thus their potential applications. Herein is described the synthesis of a family of ditopic ligands wherein the ligand scaffolds are both low symmetry and incorporate exohedral functional moieties. Key to this design is the use of CuI&#8208;catalysed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) chemistry, as the triazole is capable of acting as both a coordinating heterocycle and a tether between the ligand framework and functional unit simultaneously. A common precursor was used to generate ligands with various functionalities, allowing control of electronic properties whilst maintaining the core structure of the resultant cis&#8208;Pd2L4 nanocage assemblies. The isostructural nature of the scaffold frameworks enabled formation of combinatorial libraries from the self&#8208;assembly of ligand mixtures, generating a statistical mixture of multi&#8208;functional, low symmetry architectures.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Silylation of Csp&#8208;H by Silacyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The signature reactivity of silacyclobutane (SCB) is their cycloaddition reactions with various &#960; bonds. Recently we disclosed the first cases where SCBs reacted with both C  sp2  &#8208;H and C  sp3  &#8208;H &#963; bonds in an intramolecular fashion. Herein, we report that SCB is also an efficient reagent for C  sp  &#8208;H bond silylation. Thus, rhodium catalysed intermolecular reactions between SCBs and terminal alkynes produced a series of symmetrical and unsymmetrical tetraorganosilicons bearing a C  sp  &#8208;Si functionality. Our preliminary studied suggested that the reaction did not involve a cycloaddition pathway, but instead a direct activation of C  sp  &#8208;H bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Noncentrosymmetric Tetrel Pnictides composed of Square&#8208;Planar Au(I) with Peculiar Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three novel isostructural equiatomic gold tetrel pnictides, AuSiAs, AuGeP, and AuGeAs, were synthesized and characterized. These phases crystallize in the noncentrosymmetric (NCS) monoclinic space group Cc (No. 9), featuring square planar Au within cis &#8208;[AuTt  2  Pn  2  ] units ( Tt = tetrel, Si, Ge; Pn = pnictogen, P, As). This is in drastic contrast to the structure of the previously reported AuSiP that exhibits typical linear coordination of Au with Si and P. Chemical bonding analysis via electron localization function (ELF) suggests covalent 2c&#8208;2e Tt&#8208;Pn bonds, and 3&#8208;center Au&#8208;Tt &#8208;Au and Au&#8208;Pn &#8208;Au bonds with 1.6 e  &#8208;  /bond. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies support the covalent and not ionic nature of Au&#8208;Pn and Au&#8208;Tt bonds. The title materials were found to be n&#8208;type narrow&#8208;gap semiconductors or semimetals, with nearly temperature&#8208;independent electrical resistivities and low thermal conductivities. A combination of the semimetallic properties with tunable NCS structure provides opportunities of the materials development based on Au tetrel pnictides.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Tailored Bifunctional Luminescent Pillared&#8208;Layer Frameworks for Adsorption of CO2 and Sensitive Detection of Nitrobenzene in Water Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Through a dual&#8208;ligand synthetic approach, five isoreticular  pcu  &#8208;type pillared&#8208;layer MOFs [Zn  2  (dicarboxylate)  2  (NI&#8208;bpy&#8208;44)]&#8729;  x  DMF&#8729;  y  H  2  O, where dicarboxylate  =  1,4&#8208;bdc (  1  ), Br&#8208;1,4&#8208;bdc (  2  ), NH  2  &#8208;1,4&#8208;bdc (  3  ), 2,6&#8208;ndc (  4  ), and bpdc (  5  ), have been engineering tailored. MOFs  1  &#8211;  5  feature two&#8208;fold degree of interpenetration and have open pores of 27.0, 33.6, 36.8, 52.5, and 62.1%, respectively. N  2  adsorption isotherms of activated MOFs  1&#8242;  &#8210;  5&#8242;  at 77 K all displayed type I adsorption behavior, suggesting their microporous nature. While  1&#8242;  and  3  &#8242;  &#8722;  5&#8242;  exhibited type I adsorption isotherms of CO  2  at 195 K,  2&#8242;  showed a two&#8208;step gate&#8208;opening sorption isotherm of CO  2  . Further,  3  &#8242;  also showed significant influence of amine functions in CO  2  uptake at high temperature due to the CO  2  &#8722;framework interactions. MOFs  1  &#8211;  5  revealed solvent&#8208;dependent fluorescence properties; their strong blue light emissions in water suspensions were efficiently quenched by trace amounts of nitrobenzene (NB), with the limit of detection (LOD) of 4.54, 5.73, 1.88, 2.30, and 2.26  &#956;  M, respectively, and the Stern&#8211;Volmer quenching constants (  K  sv  ) of 2.93 &#215; 10  3  , 1.79 &#215; 10  3  , 3.78 &#215; 10  3  , 4.04 &#215; 10  3  , and 3.21 &#215; 10  3  M  &#8722;1  , respectively. Of particular note, the NB&#8208;included framework, NB@  3  , has provided direct evidences to ensure the binding sites, which show strong host&#8210;guest &#960;&#8210;&#960; and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions for benefiting donor&#8211;acceptor electron&#8208;transfer to result in fluorescence quenching.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selenoesters are compounds of great synthetic relevance, since they can be used in several types of chemical transformations and mainly due to their great capacity in the formation of acyl radicals. Therefore, the scientific community has been developing several methods for the synthesis of this class of molecules. This review will address the synthesis of these compounds from different starting materials, such as carboxylic acids derivatives (acid chlorides and anhydrides), aldehydes, selenoacetylenes and miscellaneous methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorinated Rings: Conformation and Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of fluorine atoms into molecules and materials across many fields of academic and industrial research is now commonplace, owing to their unique properties and effects. A particularly interesting feature of fluorine substitution is its impact on the relative orientation of a C&#8211;F bond when incorporated with organic molecules. In this Review, we will be shining light on this unique feature by discussing the conformational behaviour of aliphatic carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic systems. The conformational preference of each system is associated with various interactions introduced by fluorine substitution such as charge&#8208;dipole interactions, dipole&#8208;dipole interactions and hyperconjugative interactions. The contribution of each interaction on the stabilization of the fluorinated alicyclic system, which manifests itself in low conformations, will be discussed in details. The novelty of this feature will be demonstrated by presenting the most recent applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A Molecular Low&#8208;Coordinate [Fe&#8722;S&#8722;Fe] Unit in Three Oxidation States</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A [Fe&#8208;S&#8208;Fe] subunit with a single sulfide bridging two low&#8208;coordinate iron ions is the supposed active site of the iron&#8208;molybdenum co&#8208;factor (FeMoco) of nitrogenase. Here we report a dinuclear monosulfido bridged diiron(II) complex with a similar complex geometry that can be oxidized stepwise to diiron(II/III) and diiron(III/III) complexes while retaining the [Fe&#8208;S&#8208;Fe] core. The series of complexes has been characterized crystallographically, and electronic structures have been studied using, inter alia,  57  Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and SQUID magnetometry. Further, cleavage of the [Fe&#8722;S&#8722;Fe] unit by CS  2  is presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Pore Structure and Metal&#8208;Node Geometry on the Polymerization of Ethylene over Cr&#8208;Based Metal Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) have received increasing interest as solid single&#8208;site catalysts, owing to their tunable pore architecture and metal node geometry. The ability to exploit these modulators makes them prominent candidates for producing polyethylene (PE) materials with narrow dispersity index (&#208;) values. Here we present a study in which we systematically investigated the ethylene polymerization properties, with Et2AlCl as activator, of three renowned Cr&#8208;based MOFs: MIL&#8208;101(Cr)&#8208;NDC (NDC = 2,6&#8208;dicarboxynapthalene), MIL&#8208;53(Cr) and HKUST&#8208;1(Cr). Ethylene polymerization reactions revealed varying catalytic activities, with MIL&#8208;101(Cr)&#8208;NDC and MIL&#8208;53(Cr) being significantly more active than HKUST&#8208;1(Cr). Analysis of the PE products revealed large &#208; values, demonstrating that polymerization occurs over a multitude of active Cr centers rather than a singular type of Cr site. Spectroscopic experiments, in the form of powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (pXRD), UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (DRS) and CO probe molecule Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy corroborated these findings, indicating that indeed for each MOF unique active sites are generated, however without alteration of the original oxidation state. Furthermore, the pXRD experiments indicated that one major prerequisite for catalytic activity was the degree of MOF activation by the Et2AlCl co&#8208;catalyst, with the more active materials portraying a larger degree of activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Do docking sites persist upon fluorination? The diadamantyl ether&#8208;aromatics challenge for rotational spectroscopy and theory</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorinated derivatives of biological molecules have proved to be highly efficient at modifying the biological activity of a given protein through changes in the stability and the kind of docking interactions. These interactions can be hindered or facilitated based on the hydrophilic/hydrophobic character of a particular protein region. Diadamantyl ether ( C 20 H 30 O ) possesses both kinds of docking sites, serving as a good template to model these important contacts with aromatic fluorinated counterparts. We report here an experimental study on the structures of several complexes between diadamantyl ether and benzene as well as a series of fluorinated benzenes to analyze the effect of H &#8594; F substitution on the interaction and structure of the resulting molecular clusters using rotational spectroscopy. All experimentally observed complexes are largely dominated by London dispersion interactions with the hydrogen&#8208;terminated surface areas of diadamantyl ether. Already single substitution of one hydrogen atom with fluorine changes the preferred docking site of the complexes. However, the overall contributions of the different intermolecular interactions are similar for the different complexes, contrary to previous studies focusing on the difference in interactions using fluorinated and non&#8208;fluorinated molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Not Carbon s&#8211;p Hybridization, but Coordination Number Determines C&#8211;H and C&#8211;C Bond Length</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A fundamental and ubiquitous phenomenon in chemistry is the contraction of both C&#8211;H and C&#8211;C bonds as the carbon atoms involved vary, in s&#8211;p hybridization, along sp 3 &#160;to sp 2 &#160;to sp. Our quantum&#8208;chemical bonding analyses based on Kohn&#8208;Sham molecular orbital theory show that the generally accepted rationale behind this trend is incorrect. Inspection of the molecular orbitals and their corresponding orbital overlaps reveals that the above&#8208;mentioned shortening in C&#8211;H and C&#8211;C bonds is not determined by an increasing amount of&#160; s &#8208;character at the carbon atom in these bonds. Instead, we establish that this structural trend is caused by a diminishing steric (Pauli) repulsion between substituents around the pertinent carbon atom, as the coordination number decreases along sp 3 &#160;to sp 2 &#160;to sp.</dc:description>

         <title>Air Stable Iridium Catalysts for Direct Reductive Amination of Ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Half&#8208;sandwich iridium complexes bearing bidentate urea&#8208;phosphorus ligands were found to catalyze the direct reductive amination of aromatic and aliphatic ketones under mild conditions at 0.5 mol.% loading with high selectivity towards primary amines. One of the complexes was found to be active in both the Leuckart&#8208;Wallach (NH4CO2H) type reaction as well as in the hydrogenative (H2/NH4AcO) reductive amination. The protocol with ammonium formate does not require an inert atmosphere, dry solvents, as well as additives and in contrast to previous reports takes place in HFIP instead of methanol. Applying NH4CO2D or D2 resulted in a high degree of deuterium incorporation into the primary amine &#945;&#8208;position.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;pressure nucleation of low&#8208;density polymorphs</title>

         <dc:description>New polymorphs &#946; and &#947; of bis&#8208;3&#8208;nitrophenyl disulphide, crystallized above 0.3 GPa, are less dense than the ambient&#8208;pressure polymorph &#945;. This counterinitiative density relation results from the high&#8208;entropy nucleation and subsequent kinetic crystallization. The work performed by pressure compensates the high entropy and temperature product, substantiated in varied conformers and increased chemical potential. Pressure&#8208;increased viscosity promotes the kinetic polymorphs, in accordance with empirical Ostwald&#8217;s rule of stages. It contrasts to mechanochemical techniques, favouring high&#8208;density polymorphs.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Uncommon Fluorescent Recognition Mechanism Towards Pertechnetate Using a Cationic Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Bearing N&#8208;heterocyclic AIE Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As one of most problematic radionuclides, technetium&#8208;99, mainly in the form of anionic pertechnetate (TcO4&#8208;), exhibits high environmental mobility, long half&#8208;life and radioactive hazard. Due to low charge density and high hydrophobicity for this tetrahedral anion, it is extremely difficult to recognize it in water. Seeking efficient and selective recognition method for TcO4&#8208; is still a big challenge. Herein, we reported a new water&#8208;stable cationic metal&#8208;organic framework (ZJU&#8208;X8) bearing tetraphenylethylene pyrimidine&#8208;based aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) ligands and attainable silver sites for TcO4&#8208; detection. ZJU&#8208;X8 underwent an obvious spectroscopic change from brilliant blue to flavovirens and exhibited splendid selectivity towards TcO4&#8208;. Such uncommon fluorescent recognition mechanism was well elucidated by the batch sorption experiments and density functional theoretical (DFT) calculations. It is found that only TcO4&#8208; could enter into the body of ZJU&#8208;X8 through anion exchange whereas other competing anions were excluded outside. Subsequently, after interaction between TcO4&#8208; and silver ions, the electron polarizations from pyrimidine rings to Ag+ cations significantly lowered the energy level of the &#960;* orbital and thus reduced the &#960;&#8208;&#960;* energy gap, resulting in a red&#8208;shift in the fluorescent spectra.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective Access to Tetracyclic Eight&#8208;Membered Lactams through a Dearomative Heck Reaction and an Alkylative Ring&#8208;Opening Driven by the Photoexcited Spiroindolines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An external&#8208;photocatalyst&#8208;free, light&#8208;driven alkylative ring&#8208;opening of stable spiroindolines was newly developed to construct indolo&#8208; and benzoannulated eight&#8208;membered lactams. The spiroindolines were prepared from tetrahydro&#8208; &#946; &#8208;carbolines by a dearomative Heck reaction. Mechanistic experimental studies on the alkylative ring opening suggest that a photoredox pathway is involved, in which the spiroindoline performs as both reagent and photosensitizer. DFT calculations show that the stereoselective radical addition toward a cyclic alkene is the key to the diastereoselective&#160;formation of tetracyclic medium&#8208;sized membered lactams.</dc:description>

         <title>Na6MQ4 (M = Zn, Cd, Q = S, Se): Promising Novel Ternary Infrared Nonlinear Optical Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Four Na&#8208;based ternary infrared nonlinear&#8208;optical (IR NLO) materials, Na  6  MQ  4  (M = Zn, Cd, Q = S, Se), were prepared via high temperature flux method.  The crystal structure of the compounds is built up of isolated [MQ  4  ]&#8208;tetrahedra and a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) framework formed by the NaQ  n  (n = 4, 5) units. The two selenides, Na  6  MSe  4  (M = Zn, Cd), as promising IR NLO materials, show moderate second&#8208;harmonic generation responses (0.9 and 0.5 &#215; AgGaS  2  ) with good phase&#8208;matching behaviors, as well as high laser damage thresholds (2 and 1.9 &#215; AgGaS  2  ).The two sulfides, Na  6  MS  4  (M =Zn, Cd), exhibit higher  laser damage thresholds  (13 and 4 &#215; AgGaS  2  ) but smaller SHG responses (0.3 and 0.2 &#215; AgGaS  2  ). The theoretical calculations and statistical analyses indicate that t  he SHG effect and band gap in the compounds originate mainly from the distorted NaQ  4  NLO&#8208;active units, which provides a new insight into the design of novel IR NLO materials.</dc:description>

The theoretical calculations and statistical analyses indicate that t  he SHG effect and band gap in the compounds originate mainly from the distorted NaQ  4  NLO&#8208;active units, which provides a new insight into the design of novel IR NLO materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Described herein is a function&#8208;oriented synthesis route and biological evaluation of pseudoguaianolide analogs. The 10&#8208;step synthetic route developed retains the topological complexity of the natural product, installs functional handles for late&#8208;stage diversification, and forges the key bioactive Michael acceptors early in the synthesis. The analogs were found to be low&#8208;micromolar Nrf2 activators and micromolar NF&#8208;&#954;B inhibitors and dependent on the local environment of the Michael acceptor moieties.</dc:description>

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Investigation on Structural and Opto&#8208;electronic Properties of Fe&#8208;Doped Lead&#8208;Free Cs2AgBiCl6 Double Perovskite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis of Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 lead&#8208;free double perovskite with blue emission using an antisolvent method. The crystal structure, morphology, optical properties, band structure, and stability of Fe&#8208;doped double perovskites are investigated systematically. Formation of Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite is confirmed by XRD and XPS analysis. XRD and TGA shows that the Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite has high structural and thermal stability, respectively. FE&#8208;SEM analysis revealed the formation of dipyramidal shape Cs2AgBiCl6 crystals. Furthermore, EDS mapping shows the overlapping of Cs, Bi, Ag, Fe, and Cl elements and homogenous incorporation of Fe in Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite. The Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite shows a strong absorption at 380 nm. It extends up to 700 nm, suggesting that sub&#8208;bandgap states transition may originate from the surface defect of the doped perovskite material. The radiative kinetics of the crystals was studied using the TCSPC technique. Lattice parameters and band gap value Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskites predicted by the DFT calculations are confirmed by XRD and UV&#8208;Visible spectroscopy analysis. Time&#8208;dependent photo&#8208;response characteristics for Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite show fast response and recovery time of charge carriers. We believe that the successful incorporation of Fe in lead&#8208;free, environmentally friendly Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite can open a new class of doped double perovskites with significant potential opto&#8208;electronics applications, photocatalysts, and photovoltaics.</dc:description>

         <title>Bicyclic phenyl&#8208;ethynyl architectures: Synthesis of a 1,4&#8208;bis (phenylbuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyn&#8208;1&#8208;yl) benzene banister</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The novel diacetylene bridged terphenylic macrocycle 1 is presented and discussed in the context of rotationally restricted &#8220;Gel&#228;nder&#8221; oligomers. The 1,4&#8208;bis(phenylbuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyn&#8208;1&#8208;yl) benzene bridge of diacetylene 1 is significantly longer than its terphenyl backbone, forcing the bridge to bend around the central pylon. The synthesis of molecule 1 is based to a large extent on acetylene scaffolding strategies, profiting from orthogonal alkyne protection groups to close both macrocyclic subunits by oxidative acetylene coupling sequentially. The spatial arrangement and the dynamic enantiomerization process of the bicyclic target structure 1 are analyzed. In&#8208;depth NMR investigations not only reveal an unexpected spatial arrangement with both oligomer strands bent alongside the backbone, but also display the limited stability of the model compound in the presence of molecular oxygen.</dc:description>

         <title>Altered Membrane Mechanics Provides a Receptor&#8208;Independent&#160; Pathway for Serotonin Action</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Serotonin, an important signaling molecule in humans, has an unexpectedly high lipid membrane affinity. The significance of this finding has evoked considerable speculation. Here we show that membrane binding by serotonin can directly modulate membrane pro&#173;perties and cellular function, providing an activity pathway completely independent of serotonin receptors. Atomic force microscopy shows that serotonin makes artificial lipid bilayers softer, and induces nucle&#173;ation of liquid disordered domains inside the raft&#8208;like liquid&#8208;ordered domains. Solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy corroborates this data at the atomic level, revealing a homogeneous decrease in the order para&#173;meter of the lipid chains in the presence of serotonin. In the RN46A immortalized serotonergic neuronal cell line, extracellular serotonin enhances transferrin receptor endocytosis, even in the presence of broad&#8208;spectrum serotonin receptor and transporter inhibitors. Simi&#173;larly, it increases the membrane binding and internalization of oligo&#173;meric peptides. Our results uncover a mode of serotonin&#8208;membrane interaction that can potentiate key cellular processes in a receptor&#8208;independent fashion.</dc:description>

         <title>Directed Design of a AuI Complex with a Reduced Mesoionic Carbene Radical&#8208;Ligand: Insights from 1,2,3&#8208;Triazolylidene Selenium Adducts and Extensive Electrochemical Investigations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbene&#8208;based radicals are important for both fundamental and applied chemical research. We herein report extensive electrochemical investigations of nine different 1,2,3&#8208;triazolylidene selenium adducts. We found that the half&#8208;wave potentials of the first reduction of the selones correlate with their calculated LUMO energies and LUMO energies of the corresponding triazolylidene based mesoionic carbenes (MICs). Furthermore, unexpected quasi&#8208;reversiblility of the reduction of two triazoline selones, exhibiting comparable reduction potentials, was discovered. Through UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR&#8208; and EPR&#8208; spectroelectrochemical investigations supported by DFT calculations, the radical anion was unambiguously assigned to be triazoline centered. This electrochemical behavior was transferred to a triazolylidene&#8208;type gold&#8208;MIC phenyl complex resulting in a MIC&#8208;radical coordinated AuI species. Apart from UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR&#8208; and EPR spectroelectrochemical investigations of the reduction, the reduced gold coordinated MIC&#8208;radical complex was also formed in situ in the bulk through chemical reduction. This is the first report of a monodentate triazolylidene&#8208;based MIC ligand that can be reduced to its anion radical in a metal complex. The results presented here provide design principles for stabilizing radicals based on MICs.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;oxidation controlled surface pattern with responsive wrinkle and fluorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Wrinkles and photo&#8208;oxidation reactions are widely found in soft materials, which are intimately associated with the failure of materials and structures. It is expected that the photo&#8208;oxidation process will have a positive effect on the material and its surface. Here, we report the photo&#8208;oxidation of 2&#8208;(4&#8208;Dietheylaminophenyl)&#8208;4,5&#8208;bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl) imidazole (DEA&#8208;TAI) into a bilayer wrinkling system to control surface wrinkle and fluorescent pattern, in which a supramolecular polymer network composed of carboxyl acid containing copolymer (PS&#8208;BA&#8208;AA) and DEA&#8208;TAI was used as the skin layer. Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation can induce photo&#8208;oxidation of the imidazole ring of DEA&#8208;TAI to weaken the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between PS&#8208;BA&#8208;AA and DEA&#8208;TAI, resulting in the release of stress in the bilayer system. The wrinkle morphology and fluorescence of the surface can be simultaneously regulated by photo&#8208;oxidation of DEA&#8208;TAI caused by UV light, and the resulting wrinkles are extremely sensitive to pH, which can be quickly and reversibly erased by NH 3 gas. Smart surfaces with specific hierarchical wrinkles and fluorescence can be achieved by selective irradiation with photomasks, which may find potential applications in smart displays and multi&#8208;code information storage.</dc:description>

Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation can induce photo&#8208;oxidation of the imidazole ring of DEA&#8208;TAI to weaken the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between PS&#8208;BA&#8208;AA and DEA&#8208;TAI, resulting in the release of stress in the bilayer system. The wrinkle morphology and fluorescence of the surface can be simultaneously regulated by photo&#8208;oxidation of DEA&#8208;TAI caused by UV light, and the resulting wrinkles are extremely sensitive to pH, which can be quickly and reversibly erased by NH 3 gas. Smart surfaces with specific hierarchical wrinkles and fluorescence can be achieved by selective irradiation with photomasks, which may find potential applications in smart displays and multi&#8208;code information storage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>5&#8208;Methylcytosine Substantially Enhances the Thermal Stability of DNA Minidumbbell</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Minidumbbell (MDB) is a recently identified non&#8208;B DNA structure which has been proposed to associate with genetic instabilities.&#160; It also serves as a functional structural motif in DNA nanotechnology.&#160; DNA molecular switches constructed using MDBs show instant and complete structural conversions with easy manipulations.&#160; The availability of stable MDBs can broaden their applications.&#160; In this work, we found that substitutions of cytosine with 5&#8208;methylcytosine could lead to a significant enhancement in the thermal stabilities of MDBs.&#160; Consecutive methylations of cytosine in MDBs brought about cumulative stabilization with a drastic increase in the melting temperature by 23 &#176;C.&#160; NMR solution structures of two MDBs containing 5&#8208;methylcytosine residues have been successfully determined and revealed that the enhanced stabilities resulted primarily from favorable hydrophobic contacts, more stable base pairs and enhanced base&#8208;base stackings involving the methyl groups of 5&#8208;methylcytosine.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective Synthesis of 1,2,3,4&#8208;Tetrasubstituted Arenes by Vicinal Functionalization of Arynes Derived from Aryl(Mes)iodonium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe the synthesis of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetra&#8208;substituted benzenoid rings, motifs found in pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and natural products. In the past, the regioselective syntheses of such compounds have been a significant challenge. We now report a method using substituted arynes derived from aryl(Mes)iodonium salts to access a range of densely functionalized 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrasubstituted benzenoid rings. Significantly, we show that halide substituents are compatible under these conditions, enabling post&#8208;synthetic elaboration via palladium&#8208;catalyzed coupling. This concise strategy is predicated on two regioselective events: 1) ortho&#8208; deprotonation of aryl(Mes)iodonium salts to generate a substituted aryne intermediate, and 2) regioselective trapping of said arynes. We have improved upon our previous reaction conditions to generate arynes at room temperature and in shorter reaction times. Density functional theory (DFT) computations and linear free energy relationship (LFER) analysis suggest the regioselectivity of deprotonation is influenced by both proximal and distal functional groups on the aryne precursor. A competition experiment further reveals the role of arene substituents on relative reactivity of aryne precursors.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Emissive 9&#8208;Borafluorene Derivatives: Synthesis, Photophysical Properties, and Device Fabrication</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of 9&#8208;borafluorene derivatives, functionalised with electron&#8208;donating groups, was prepared. Some of these 9&#8208;borafluorene compounds exhibit strong yellowish emission in solution and in the solid state with relative high quantum yields (up to 73.6% for  FMesB&#8208;Cz  as a neat film). Highly twisted donor groups suppress the charge transfer but the intrinsic photophysical properties of 9&#8208;borafluorene systems remain and the new compounds possess enhanced stability to the atmosphere. All of these compounds exhibit excellent thermal stability, revealing their potential for applications in materials science. OLED devices were fabricated with two of the highly emissive compounds, and they exhibit strong yellow&#8208;greenish electro&#8208;luminescence with maximum luminance intensity &gt; 22000 cd&#183;m  &#8208;2  . This is the first example of 9&#8208;borafluorene derivatives being used as light&#8208;emitting materials in OLED devices, and helps us to achieve a balance between maintaining their intrinsic properties and improving their stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid and Mild Lactamization Using Highly Electrophilic Triphosgene in a Micro&#8208;Flow Reactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lactams are cyclic amides that are indispensable as drugs and as drug candidates. Conventional lactamization includes acid&#8208;mediated approaches and coupling agent&#8208;mediated approaches that suffer from a narrow substrate scope, much waste, and/or high cost. Inexpensive, less wasteful and highly electrophilic reagent&#8208;mediated approaches are attractive, but there is an imminent risk of side reactions. Herein, we describe methods using highly electrophilic triphosgene in a micro&#8208;flow reactor that accomplish lactamization that are rapid (0.5&#8208;10 sec), mild, inexpensive, and less wasteful. We developed two methods, referred to here as A and B, using NMM and NMI, respectively. Various lactams as well as a cyclic peptide containing acid&#8208; and/or heat&#8208;labile functional groups were synthesized in good to high yields without the need for tedious purifications. Undesired reactions were successfully suppressed and the risk in handling triphosgene was minimized by the use of micro&#8208;flow technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Arylindigoids by Late&#8208;Stage Derivatization of Biocatalytically Synthesized Dibromoindigo</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Indigoids represent natural product&#8208;based compounds applicable as organic semiconductors and photoresponsive materials. Yet modified indigo derivatives are difficult to access by chemical synthesis. Thus a biocatalytic approach applying several consecutive selective C&#8211;H functionalizations was developed that selectively provides access to various indigoids: Enzymatic halogenation of l&#8208;tryptophan followed by indole generation with tryptophanase yields 5&#8208;, 6&#8208; and 7&#8208;bromoindoles. Subsequent hydroxylation using a flavin monooxygenase furnishes dibromoindigo that is derivatized by acylation. This four&#8208;step one&#8208;pot cascade gives Boc&#8208;protected dibromoindigo in good isolated yields. The halogen substituent allows for late&#8208;stage diversification by cross&#8208;coupling directly performed in the crude mixture, thus enabling synthesis of 5,5&#8217;&#8208; and 6,6&#8217;&#8208;diarylindigo derivatives. This chemoenzymatic approach provides a modular platform towards novel indigoids with attractive spectral properties.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unprecedented metalated phosphonite boranes were prepared from PH&#8208;substituted precursors and silyl amides. While potassium derivatives were thermally stable and could even be isolated and structurally characterised, lithiated analogues proved unstable towards self&#8208;condensation under cleavage of LiOR at ambient temperature. Reaction studies revealed that the metalated phosphonite boranes exhibit ambiphilic character. Their synthetic potential as nucleophilic building blocks was demonstrated in the synthesis of the first stannylated phosphonite representing a new structural motif in phosphine chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>How the physicochemical properties of the bulk material affect the ablation crater profile, mass balance and bubble dynamics during single&#8208;pulse, nanosecond laser ablation in water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the key steps that drive the laser&#8208;based synthesis of colloids is a prerequisite for learning how to optimize the ablation process in terms of the nanoparticle output and functional design of the nanomaterials. Even though many studies focus on cavitation bubble formation using single&#8208;pulse ablation conditions, the ablation efficiency and nanoparticle properties are typically investigated under prolonged ablation conditions with repetition rate lasers. Linking single&#8208;pulse and multiple&#8208;pulse ablation is difficult due to limitations induced by gas formation cross&#8208;effects, which occur on longer timescales and depend on the target materials' oxidation&#8208;sensitivity. Therefore, this study investigates the ablation and cavitation bubble dynamics under nanosecond, single laser pulse conditions for six different bulk materials (Au, Ag, Cu, Fe, Ti, and Al). Also, the effective threshold fluences, ablation volumes and penetration depths are quantified for the these materials. The thermal and chemical properties of the corresponding bulk materials not only favor the formation of larger spot sizes but also lead to the highest molar ablation efficiencies for low melting materials such as Al. Furthermore, the concept of the cavitation bubble growth linked with the oxidation sensitivity of the ablated material is discussed. With this, evidence is provided that intensive chemical reactions occurring during the very early timescale of ablation are significantly enhanced by the bubble collapse.</dc:description>
