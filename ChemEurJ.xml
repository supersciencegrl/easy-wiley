         <title>Tetrathienyl Corannulene Compounds with Highly Sensitive Photochromism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrathienyl corannulene compounds showed highly sensitive photochromism with a large molar absorption coefficient and photocyclization quantum yield close to 1, although dithienyl phenanthrene compounds showed no photoreactivity. Such a high photoreactivity was rationalized by the predominance of the photoreactive atropisomers amplified by energy migration, and the curvature&#8208;induced short distance between photoreactive carbons. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Yamada, T. Kawai, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201286).

         <title>Peri&#8208;Decoration of a Tetraazaperylene with Urea Units: Chiral Octaazaperopyrenedioxides (OAPPDOs) and Their Optical and Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decorating tetraazaperylene. A new class of highly fluorescent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, octaazaperopyrenedioxides (OAPPDOs) is described along with their electrochemical, photophysical and chiroptical properties. They contain a tetraazaperylene core with a urea&#8208;derived periphery that is complementary to the dicarboximido termini in perylene tetracarboxydiimides.







Abstract
Octaazaperopyrenedioxides (OAPPDOs) are a new class of fluorescent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons based on a tetraazaperylene core that is formally condensed with N&#8208;substituted urea units in the two opposite peri positions. Here, we report the synthesis of series of substituted OAPPDO derivatives with different N&#8208;substitution patterns (H, alkyl, benzyl) in the peri positions, including bay&#8208;chlorinated OAPPDOs. Starting from the latter, a series of bay&#8208;arylated OAPPDOs was synthesized by Suzuki cross coupling, which resulted in the formation of helically chiral OAPPDO derivatives. The electrochemical and photophysical properties were investigated by UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy as well as cyclic voltammetry. The P and M enantiomers of a phenylated OAPPDO were separated by semipreparative HPLC and further analyzed by CD spectroscopy. The frontier orbital energies, the mechanism of the isomerization, the electronic excitation and the CD spectrum (TD&#8208;DFT) were computed and compared to the experimental data. The reversible 1e&#8722; oxidation of the OAPPDOs generates the corresponding radical cations, one of which was characterized by EPR spectroscopy. The reversible oxidation process was also systematically investigated by spectro&#8208;electrochemistry.

         <title>Profiling Heparan Sulfate&#8208;Heavy Metal Ions Interaction Using Electrochemical Techniques</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans provides extracellular matrix defense against heavy metals cytotoxicity. Identifying the precise glycan sequences that bind a particular heavy metal ion is a key for understanding those interactions. Here, electrochemical and surface characterization techniques were used to elucidate the relation between the glycans structural motifs, uronic acid stereochemistry, and sulfation regiochemistry to heavy metal ions binding. A divergent strategy was employed to access a small library of structurally well&#8208;defined tetrasaccharides analogs with different sulfation patterns and uronic acid compositions. These tetrasaccharides were electrochemically grafted onto glassy carbon electrodes and their response to heavy metal ions was monitored by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Key differences in the binding of Hg(II), Cd(II), and Pb(II) were associated with a combination of the uronic acid type and the sulfation pattern</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling of Arylhalides and Organozinc Pivalates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cross&#8208;coupling reactions are essential tools in target molecule synthesis. However, the use of highly reactive organometallic reagents limits their applicability. Here we present mechanochemical Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction between aryl halides and organozinc pivalates that can be carried out under ambient temperature and atmosphere. This operationally simple procedure affords a wide range of biaryl and aryl&#8208;heteroaryl derivatives in high yields and short times. The reaction tolerates various functional groups and can be realized on a synthetically useful scale. Its practical value was demonstrated in the short synthesis of the pharmaceutical diflunisal.</dc:description>

         <title>Spin&#8208;Labeled Riboswitch Synthesized from a Protected TPA Phosphoramidite Building Block</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The nitroxide TPA (2,2,5,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;pyrrolin&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl&#8208;3&#8208;acetylene) is an excellent spin label for EPR studies of RNA. Previous synthetic methods, however, are complicated and require special equipment. Here we describe a uridine derived phosphoramidite with a photocaged TPA unit attached. The light sensitive 2&#8208;nitrobenzyloxymethyl group can be removed in high yield by short irradiation at 365 nm. Based on this approach, a doubly spin&#8208;labeled 27mer neomycin sensing riboswitch was synthesized and studied by PELDOR. The overall thermal stability of the fold is not much reduced by TPA. In&#8208;line probing nevertheless detected changes in local mobility.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The unprecedented Pd&#8208;catalyzed (ethoxycarbonyl)difluoromethylthiolation reaction of various unsaturated derivatives was studied. In the presence of the (ethoxycarbonyl)difluoromethylsulfenamide reagent  I  and under mild reaction conditions (60 &#176;C), both 2&#8208;(hetero)aryl and 2&#8208;(a&#8208;aryl&#8208;vinyl)pyridine derivatives were smoothly functionalized with this methodology (37 examples, up to 87% yield). Moreover, the synthetic interest of this fluorinated moiety was further showcased by its conversion into various original fluorinated residues. Finally, a plausible mechanism for this transformation was suggested.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of 13C and 2H Labeled Vinyl Pyruvate   and Hyperpolarization of Pyruvate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hyperpolarization of nuclear spins has enabled unique applications in chemistry, biophysics, and particularly in metabolic imaging. Parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization (PHIP) offers a fast and cost&#8208;efficient way of hyperpolarization. Nevertheless, PHIP lags behind dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP), which is already being evaluated in clinical studies. This shortcoming is mainly due to problems in the synthesis of the corresponding PHIP precursor molecules. The most widely used DNP tracer in clinical studies, particularly for the detection of prostate cancer, is 1&#8208;  13  C&#8208;pyruvate. The ideal derivative for PHIP is the deuterated vinyl ester because the spin physics allows for 100% polarization. Unfortunately, there is no efficient synthesis for vinyl esters of &#946;&#8208;ketocarboxylic acids in general and pyruvate in particular. Here, we present an efficient new method for the preparation of vinyl esters, including  13  C labeled, fully deuterated vinyl pyruvate using a palladium catalyzed procedure. Using 50 % enriched parahydrogen and mild reaction conditions, a  13  C polarization of 12% was readily achieved; 36% are expected with 100% pH  2  . Higher polarization values can be potentially achieved with optimized reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct C&#8722;H Trifluoromethylation of (Hetero)Arenes in Water Enabled by Organic Photoredox&#8208;Active Amphiphilic Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoredox&#8208;catalyzed trifluoromethylations of a variety of small organic molecules were studied in water with the aid of amphiphilic polymeric nanoparticles. Excellent recyclability of the nanoparticles, high efficacy and selectivity, and the use of low intensity LED or sunlight render this method versatile and environmentally friendly.







Abstract
Photoredox&#8208;catalyzed chemical conversions are predominantly operated in organic media to ensure good compatibility between substrates and catalysts. Yet, when conducted in aqueous media, they are an attractive, mild, and green way to introduce functional groups into organic molecules. We here show that trifluoromethyl groups can be readily installed into a broad range of organic compounds by using water as the reaction medium and light as the energy source. To bypass solubility obstacles, we developed robust water&#8208;soluble polymeric nanoparticles that accommodate reagents and photocatalysts within their hydrophobic interior under high local concentrations. By taking advantage of the high excited state reduction potential of N&#8208;phenylphenothiazine (PTH) through UV light illumination, the direct C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of a wide array of small organic molecules is achieved selectively with high substrate conversion. Key to our approach is slowing down the production of CF3 radicals during the chemical process by reducing the catalyst loading as well as the light intensity, thereby improving effectiveness and selectivity of this aqueous photocatalytic method. Furthermore, the catalyst system shows excellent recyclability and can be fueled by sunlight. The method we propose here is versatile, widely applicable, energy efficient, and attractive for late&#8208;stage introduction of trifluoromethyl groups into biologically active molecules.

         <title>Flexible Alkylene Bridges as a Tool To Engineer Crystal Distyrylbenzene Structures Enabling Highly Fluorescent Monomeric Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing flexible alkylene bridges to distyrylbenzene can realize monomeric emission in the solid state without any requirement for bulky substituents and has many potential applications, diversifying crystal structure design and fabrication strategies.







Abstract
To design ultrabright fluorescent solid dyes, a crystal engineering strategy that enables monomeric emission by blocking intermolecular electronic interactions is required. We introduced propylene moieties to distyrylbenzene (DSB) as bridges between the phenyl rings either side of its C=C bonds. The bridged DSB derivatives formed compact crystals that emit colors similar to those of the same molecules in dilute solution, with high quantum yields. The introduction of flexible seven&#8208;membered rings to the DSB core produced moderate distortion and steric hindrance in the DSB &#960;&#8208;plane. However, owing to this strategy, it was possible to control the molecular arrangement with almost no decrease in the crystal density, and intermolecular electronic interactions were suppressed. The bridged DSB crystal structure differs from other DSB derivative structures; thus, bridging affords access to novel crystalline systems. This design strategy has important implications in many fields and is more effective than the conventional photofunctional molecular crystal design strategies.

         <title>On the Evolutionary History of the Twenty Encoded Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amino acids and proteins! &#8220;Unde venistis&#8221;? The answer to the question of where these (macro)molecules come from is told as a journey that starts with meteorites and ends with the origin of the genetic code. On this journey, which incorporates the citric acid cycle and glycolysis, molecular companions and fellow travelers appear on the scene, in particular coenzymes and cofactors.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Amino acids are essential molecular constituents of life, twenty of which are privileged because they are encoded by the ribosomal machinery. The question remains open as to why this number and why this 20 in particular, an almost philosophical question that cannot be conclusively resolved. They are closely related to the evolution of the genetic code and whether nucleic acids, amino acids, and peptides appeared simultaneously and were available under prebiotic conditions when the first self&#8208;sufficient complex molecular system emerged on Earth. This report focuses on prebiotic and metabolic aspects of amino acids and proteins starting with meteorites, followed by their formation, including peptides, under plausible prebiotic conditions, and the major biosynthetic pathways in the various kingdoms of life. Coenzymes play a key role in the present analysis in that amino acid metabolism is linked to glycolysis and different variants of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA, rTCA, and the incomplete horseshoe version) as well as the biosynthesis of the most important coenzymes. Thus, the report opens additional perspectives and facets on the molecular evolution of primary metabolism.

         <title>A Coordination Network Featuring Two Distinct Copper(II) Coordination Environments for Highly Selective Acetylene Adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D coordination network was synthesised from commercial reagents and displays two distinct coordination environments of copper to carboxylate and salicylaldehydato moieties of the ligand. Solvent exchange of the synthesized network shows retention of framework connectivity coupled with unanticipated framework flexibility to accommodate tetrahydrofuran. The activated framework selectively adsorbs CO2 and C2Hn hydrocarbons over CH4.







Abstract
Single crystals of 2D coordination network {Cu2L2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(DMF)3(H2O)3}n (1&#8208;DMF) were prepared by reaction of commercial reagents 3&#8208;formyl&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxybenzoic acid (H2L) and Cu(NO3)2 in dimethylformamide (DMF). The single&#8208;crystal structure shows two distinct Cu(II) coordination environments arising from the separate coordination of Cu(II) cations to the carboxylate and salicylaldehydato moieties on the linker, with 1D channels running through the structure. Flexibility is exhibited on solvent exchange with ethanol and tetrahydrofuran, while porosity and the unique overall connectivity of the structure are retained. The activated material exhibits type I gas sorption behaviour and a BET surface area of 950&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 (N2, 77&#8197;K). Notably, the framework adsorbs negligible quantities of CH4 compared with CO2 and the C2Hn hydrocarbons. It exhibits exceptional selectivity for C2H2/CH4 and C2H2/C2Hn, which has applicability in separation technologies for the isolation of C2H2.

&lt;/sub&gt; hydrocarbons. It exhibits exceptional selectivity for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;

         <title>Direct Comparison of Subvalent, Polycationic Group 13 Cluster Compounds: Lessons learned on Isoelectronic DMPE Substituted Gallium and Indium Tetracation Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four members only. Two novel tetracationic, subvalent clusters [{M(dmpe)}4][Al(ORF)4]4 (M=Ga and In; dmpe=bisdimethylphosphinoethane; RF=C(CF3)3) are presented. In both clusters, the metal ions form a tetragon, with every M atom being four&#8208;coordinated by two M atoms and two donor P atoms. The respective bonding situation and dissociation behavior in solution were thoroughly investigated.







Abstract
The tetracationic, univalent cluster compounds [{M(dmpe)}4]4+ (M=Ga, In; dmpe=bis(dimethylphosphino)ethane) were synthesized as their pf salts ([pf]&#8722;=[Al(ORF)4]&#8722;; RF=C(CF3)3). The four&#8208;membered ring in [{M(dmpe)}4]4+ is slightly puckered for M=Ga and almost square planar for M=In. Yet, although structurally similar, only the gallium cluster is prevalent in solution, while the indium cluster forms temperature dependent equilibria that include even the monomeric cation [In(dmpe)]+. This system is the first report of one and the same ligand inducing formation of isoelectronic and isostructural gallium/indium cluster cations. The system allows to study systematically analogies and differences with thermodynamic considerations and bonding analyses, but also to outline perspectives for bond activation using cationic, subvalent group 13 clusters.

         <title>Online Reaction Monitoring with Fast and Flow&#8208;Compatible Diffusion NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a fast and flow compatible diffusion NMR experiment, that makes it possible to collect accurate diffusion data for samples flowing at up to 3&#8197;mL/min. We use it to monitor the synthesis of a Schiff base with a flow&#8208;tube with a time resolution of approximately 2&#8197;minutes. The one&#8208;shot flow&#8208;compatible diffusion NMR described here open many avenues for reaction monitoring applications.







Abstract
Online monitoring by flow NMR spectroscopy is a powerful approach to study chemical reactions and processes, which can provide mechanistic understanding, and drive optimisations. However, some of the most useful methods for mixture analysis and reaction monitoring are not directly applicable in flow conditions. This is the case of classic diffusion&#8208;ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY) methods, which can be used to separate the spectral information for mixture's components. We describe a fast and flow&#8208;compatible diffusion NMR experiment that makes it possible to collect accurate diffusion data for samples flowing at up to 3&#8197;mL/min. We use it to monitor the synthesis of a Schiff base with a flow&#8208;tube with a time resolution of approximately 2&#8197;minutes. The one&#8208;shot flow&#8208;compatible diffusion NMR described here open many avenues for reaction monitoring applications.

         <title>Asymmetric Core&#8208;Expanded BOPYOs: Facile Synthesis and Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2&#8208;induced self&#8208;condensation and coordination method from a single starting material has been developed, which has been studied by experiment and calculation. This gave a parent borondifluoride di(1H&#8208;pyrrolyl)butenone, the &#960;&#8208;conjugated derivatives of which were constructed as a new type of NIR chromophore with favorable photophysical properties based on the intramolecular charge transfer effect.







Abstract
N,O&#8208;bidentate BF2 complexes with five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered core rings have been thoroughly investigated. However, the development of seven&#8208;membered N,O&#8208;boron complexes is still an area to be explored. We have developed BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2&#8208;induced self&#8208;condensation and coordination reactions based on a single starting material, which had been elucidated by experiment and calculation. This parent asymmetric core&#8208;expanded borondifluoride&#8208;(Z)&#8208;1,3&#8208;di(1H&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)but&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;one (BOPYO) showed reactivity with a wide range of aldehydes, thus providing a series of conjugation BOPYOs. Moreover, a BOPYO derivative with a dimethylamino group was developed as a new NIR dye that responds to acid with favorable photophysical properties based on intramolecular charge transfer effect.

         <title>Mechanistic Insight into the Photoinduced Damage of an Unnatural Base Pair</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four photodamage products of dTPT3 have been isolated and identified, which has provided insight into the photodamage mechanism with a Type II photosensitized oxidation. The antioxidant ascorbate was discovered to effectively inhibit the formation of these photodamage products with no new byproducts generated, suggesting that a reductive environment might protect DNA dTPT3 against UVA oxidation and ameliorate its adverse biological effects.







Abstract
Chemical&#8208; and photostability of unnatural base pairs (UBPs) are important to maintain the genetic code integrity, and critical for developing healthy semisynthetic organisms. As reported, dTPT3 was less stable upon irradiation, and thus might act as a pervasive photosensitizer to induce oxidative damage within DNA, causing harm to living semi&#8208;synthetic organisms when exposed to UVA radiation. However, there was no knowledge about molecular&#8208;level understanding of this damage process. In this paper, we not only identified four photoproducts of dTPT3, including desulfur&#8208;dTPT3 (dTPT3H), TPT3 sulphinate (TPT3SO2), TPT3 sulphonate (TPT3SO3) and TPT3&#8208;thioTPT3 (TPT3STPT3), but also established a Type II photosensitized oxidation mechanism. In addition, the antioxidant (sodium ascorbate) was able to effectively inhibit the photoproducts formation of dTPT3 and dTPT3 in DNA, suggesting that a reductive environment might protect DNA bearing dTPT3 against UVA oxidation and ameliorate its adverse biological effects. The comprehensive understanding of TPT3&#8217; photochemical stability will give researchers helpful guidance to design more photostable UBPs and construct healthier semisynthetic organisms.

An Fe&#8208;catalyzed amidation of allylic alcohols with chiral  tert  &#8208;butysulfinamide via a borrowing hydrogen pathway has been developed. With water as the only by&#8208;product, a range of synthetically useful chiral sulfinamide olefin derivatives (30 examples) were obtained under mild reaction conditions. The reaction can be performed at gram&#8208;scale and the products could serve as chiral ligands for asymmetric catalysis. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction proceeds via an Fe&#8208;catalyzed borrowing hydrogen process, which is different from most of the reported allylic amination reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Well&#8208;Defined Ni(0) and Ni(II) Complexes of Bicyclic (Alkyl)(Amino)Carbene (MeBICAAC): Catalytic Activity and Mechanistic Insights in Negishi Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Negishi cross&#8208;coupling reaction of organozinc compounds as nucleophiles with aryl halides has drawn immense focus for C&#8208;C bond formation reactions. In comparison to the well&#8208;established library of Pd complexes, the C&#8208;C cross&#8208;coupling of this particular approach is largely primitive with nickel&#8208;complexes. Herein, we describe the syntheses of Ni(II) complexes, [(  Me  BICAAC)  2  NiX  2  ] (X = Cl (  1  ), Br (  2  ), and I (  3  )) by employing the bicyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (  Me  BICAAC) ligand. The reduction of complexes  1  &#8208;  3  using KC  8  afforded the two coordinate low valent, Ni(0) complex, [(  Me  BICAAC)  2  Ni(0)] (  4  ). Complexes  1&#8208;4  have been characterized by spectroscopic techniques and their solid&#8208;state structures were also confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Furthermore, complexes  1  &#8208;  4  have been applied in a direct and convenient method to catalyze the Negishi cross&#8208;coupling reaction of various aryl halides with 2,6&#8208;difluorophenylzinc bromide or phenylzinc bromide as the coupling partner in the presence of 3 mol % catalyst. Comparatively, among all&#8208;pristine complexes,  1  exhibit high catalytic potential to afford value&#8208;added C&#8208;C coupled products without the use of any additive. The UV&#8208;vis studies and HRMS measurements of controlled stochiometric reactions vindicate the involvement of Ni(I)&#8208;NI(III) cycle featured with a penta&#8208;coordinated Ni(III)&#8208;aryl species as the key intermediate for  1  whereas Ni(0)/Ni(II) species are potentially involved in the catalytic cycle of  4  .</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient water cleaning by self&#8208;standing carbon nitride films derived from supramolecular hydrogels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of efficient self&#8208;standing hybrid systems for water purification that combines good adsorption properties with high photodegradation ability is highly challenging owing to the difficulty in simultaneously controlling the band structure and porosity of a semiconductor while maintaining its self&#8208;standing nature. Here, we report the synthesis of carbon&#8208;rich carbon nitride self&#8208;standing filters from supramolecular hydrogels composed of melamine and cyanobenzoic acid. The influence of the chemical structure on the properties of the hydrogels and the final films was studied by tuning parameters such as monomer nature, molar ratio, and pyrolysis temperature. Thanks to their ability to combine the adsorption and photodegradation of organic pollutants, the prepared self&#8208;standing films showed remarkable activity and stability in flow conditions (&gt;95% efficiency after 10 consecutive cycles). Additionally, the photocatalytic activity of the films was assessed in the powder form for the hydrogen evolution reaction and photocurrent generation in a photoelectrochemical cell. The reported work opens opportunities for the controlled synthesis of multifunctional filters for water purification and other energy&#8208;related and sustainable technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochromic Fentanyl Derivatives for Controlled &#181;&#8208;Opioid Receptor Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoswitchable ligands as biological tools provide an opportunity to explore the kinetics and dynamics of the clinically relevant &#181;&#8208;opioid receptor. These ligands can potentially activate and deactivate the receptor when desired, using light. Spatial and temporal control of biological activity allows for application in a diverse range of biological investigations. Photoswitchable ligands have been developed in this work, modeled on the known agonist fentanyl, with the aim of expanding the current &#8216;toolbox&#8217; of fentanyl photoswitchable ligands. In doing so, ligands have been developed that change geometry (isomerize) upon exposure to light, with varying photophysical and biochemical properties. This variation in properties may be valuable in further studying the functional significance of the &#181;&#8208;opioid receptor.</dc:description>

         <title>A Logic Gate based on a Flexible Metal&#8208;Organic Framework (JUK&#8208;8) for the Concomitant Detection of Hydrogen and Oxygen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present an autonomous, chemical logic gate based on a switchable metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) composite, containing carbon nanoparticles and a Pt catalyst. The switchable MOF composite performs as AND logic gate. Hydrogen and oxygen gas serve as binary inputs. Catalytically formed water induces a structural transition (crystal volume expansion) of the MOF, and as a consequence, a detectable drop in conductance of the composite as a &#8216;true&#8217; output only if both gases come in contact with the composite.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Preparation and characterization of the dimeric Lewis superacid [Al(OTeF  5  )  3  ]  2  and various solvent adducts is presented. The latter range from thermally stable adducts to highly reactive, weakly bound species.

An experimental proof of the Lewis acidity is provided by the reaction of solvent&#8208;adducts of Al(OTeF  5  )  3  with [PPh  4  ][SbF  6  ] and OPEt  3&#173;  , respectively. Furthermore, their reactivity towards chloride and pentafluoroorthotellurate salts as well as (CH  3  )  3  SiCl and (CH  3  )  3  SiF is shown. This includes the formation of the dianion [Al(OTeF  5  )  5  ]  2&#8211;  .</dc:description>

         <title>Bonding Situation of &#963;&#8208;E&#8722;H complexes in Transition Metal and Main Group Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ambiguous bonding situation of &#963;&#8208;E&#8722;H (E = Si, B) complexes in transition metal compounds has been rationalized by means of Density Functional Theory calculations. To this end, the combination of the Energy Decomposition Analysis (EDA) method and its Natural Orbital for Chemical Valance (NOCV) extension has been applied to representative complexes described in the literature where the possible &#951;  1  vs &#951;  2  coordination mode is not unambiguously defined. Our quantitative analyses, which complement previous data based on the application of the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) approach, indicate that there exists a continuum between genuine &#951;  1  and &#951;  2  modes depending mainly on the strength of the backdonation. Finally, we also applied this EDA&#8208;NOCV approach to related main&#8208;group species where the backdonation is minimal.</dc:description>

         <title>Bench&#8208;Stable Dinuclear Mn(I) Catalysts in E&#8208;Selective Alkyne Semihydrogenation: A Mechanistic Investigation
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bench&#8208;stable dinuclear Mn hydrides (single&#8208;step &amp; gram&#8208;scale from commercially available materials) have utility in alkyne semihydrogenation where the trans&#8208;alkene is the kinetic product. This selectivity mechanism contrasts typical tandem hydrogenation then isomerization systems.







Abstract
Dinuclear manganese hydride complexes of the form [Mn2(CO)8(&#956;&#8208;H)(&#956;&#8208;PR2)] (R=Ph, 1; R=iPr, 2) were used in E&#8208;selective alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation (E&#8208;SASH) catalysis. Catalyst speciation studies revealed rich coordination chemistry and the complexes thus formed were isolated and in turn tested as catalysts; the results underscore the importance of dinuclearity in engendering the observed E&#8208;selectivity and provide insights into the nature of the active catalyst. The insertion product obtained from treating 2 with (cyclopropylethynyl)benzene contains a cis&#8208;alkenyl bridging ligand with the cyclopropyl ring being intact. Treatment of this complex with H2 affords exclusively trans&#8208;(2&#8208;cyclopropylvinyl)benzene. These results, in addition to other control experiments, indicate a non&#8208;radical mechanism for E&#8208;SASH, which is highly unusual for Mn&#8722;H catalysts. The catalytically actives species are virtually inactive towards cis to trans alkene isomerization indicating that the E&#8208;selective process is intrinsic and dinuclear complexes play a critical role. A reaction mechanism is proposed accounting for the observed reactivity which is fully consistent with a kinetic analysis of the rate limiting step and is further supported by DFT computations.

         <title>Enhanced Metal&#8208;Semiconductor Interaction for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective immobilization of noble metals right at the place where photogenerated electrons migrate to via the photodeposition approach is a unique strategy to load cocatalysts on semiconductors for solar hydrogen production. However, a poor metal&#8208;semiconductor interaction is often formed, which not only hinders the interfacial charge transfer, but also results in the easy aggregation and shedding of cocatalysts during photocatalytic reactions. Herein, we demonstrate that the photodeposited ultrafine metals such as nanosized Au can be well stabilized on TiO  2  nanocrystallines without sintering by employing a sacrificial carbon coating annealing strategy to strengthen the metal&#8208;support interaction. Benefiting from the improved interfacial contact between Au and TiO  2  for fast charge transfer and the well&#8208;preserved size&#8208;dependent catalytic behavior of Au nanoparticles toward hydrogen evolution reaction, the annealed Au/TiO  2  exhibits a significant enhanced activity toward photocatalytic H  2  production with good durability.</dc:description>

         <title>Cephem&#8208;Pyrazinoic Acid Conjugates: Circumventing Resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cephem&#8208;pyrazinoic acid (POA) conjugates were synthesized as novel agents for drug&#8208;resistant Tuberculosis (TB). Our strategy circumvents pncA&#8208;linked resistance mutations, which threaten continued use of the first&#8208;line antitubercular pyrazinamide (PZA), and also demonstrates promising activity against other resistant strains and models, achieving a codrug affect through combined action of the dual therapeutic modalities.







Abstract
Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading source of infectious disease mortality globally. Antibiotic&#8208;resistant strains comprise an estimated 10&#8201;% of new TB cases and present an urgent need for novel therapeutics. &#946;&#8208;lactam antibiotics have traditionally been ineffective against M. tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of TB, due to the organism's inherent expression of &#946;&#8208;lactamases that destroy the electrophilic &#946;&#8208;lactam warhead. We have developed novel &#946;&#8208;lactam conjugates, which exploit this inherent &#946;&#8208;lactamase activity to achieve selective release of pyrazinoic acid (POA), the active form of a first&#8208;line TB drug. These conjugates are selectively active against M. tuberculosis and related mycobacteria, and activity is retained or even potentiated in multiple resistant strains and models. Preliminary mechanistic investigations suggest that both the POA &#8220;warhead&#8221; as well as the &#946;&#8208;lactam &#8220;promoiety&#8221; contribute to the observed activity, demonstrating a codrug strategy with important implications for future TB therapy.

         <title>Reactions of Diethylazo&#8208;Dicarboxylate with Frustrated Lewis Pairs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions of phosphines and B(C6F5)3 or BPh3 with diethyl azodicarboxylate (DEAD) afforded products with either P&#8722;N/B&#8722;O lor P&#8722;N/B&#8722;N linkages. In all cases, the isomers obtained were computed to be both higher in energy and were readily distinguishable by 31P and 11B&#8197;NMR parameters. Steric demands and electronics are shown to impact the nature of these FLP addition products.







Abstract
Reactions of PAr3/B(C6F5)3 (Ar=o&#8208;Tol, Mes, Ph) FLPs with diethyl azodicarboxylate (DEAD) afford the corresponding FLP addition products 1&#8211;3 in which P&#8722;N and B&#8722;O linkages are formed. In contrast, the reaction of BPh3, PPh3 and DEAD gave product 4 where P&#8722;N and N&#8722;B linkages were confirmed. In all cases, other binding modes were computed to be both higher in energy and readily distinguishable by 31P and 11B&#8197;NMR parameters. These data illustrate the influence of steric demands and electronic structures on the nature of the products of FLP reactions with DEAD.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Adipic Esters and Adiponitrile via Photoassisted Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Alkene Hydrodimerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work disclosed a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced cobalt&#8208;catalyzed tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail hydrodimerization of activated alkenes to 1,4&#8208;difunctional butanes, providing a general route to important industrial intermediates to nylon&#8197;6,6. This protocol is highly efficient for various activated alkenes at ambient temperature utilizing hantzsch ester as a recyclable two&#8208;electron and two&#8208;proton donor with assistant of catalytic amount of base as the proton shuttle.







Abstract
The direct hydrodimerization of acrylates and acrylonitrile offers a general streamlined access to industrially important intermediates to nylon&#8197;6,6. However, a practical catalytic method for this process has thus far underdeveloped owing to the challenges in regioselectivity and environmental compatibility of applied reagents. Here, we report a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail hydrodimerization of activated alkenes driven by a visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis at ambient temperature, which is applicable to both adipates and adiponitrile synthesis from potentially renewable feedstocks. This protocol utilizes half equivalent of hantzsch ester as a recyclable two&#8208;electron and two&#8208;proton donor with the assistance of catalytic amount of base as a proton shuttle, and has been shown to be highly regioselective and efficient for hydrodimerizing various activated alkenes to 1,4&#8208;difunctionalized butane derivatives.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The direct hydrodimerization of acrylates and acrylonitrile offers a general streamlined access to industrially important intermediates to nylon&#8197;6,6. However, a practical catalytic method for this process has thus far underdeveloped owing to the challenges in regioselectivity and environmental compatibility of applied reagents. Here, we report a cobalt-catalyzed tail-to-tail hydrodimerization of activated alkenes driven by a visible-light photoredox catalysis at ambient temperature, which is applicable to both adipates and adiponitrile synthesis from potentially renewable feedstocks. This protocol utilizes half equivalent of hantzsch ester as a recyclable two-electron and two-proton donor with the assistance of catalytic amount of base as a proton shuttle, and has been shown to be highly regioselective and efficient for hydrodimerizing various activated alkenes to 1,4-difunctionalized butane derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modeling Heme Peroxidase: Heme Saddling Facilitates Reactions with Hyperperoxides To Form High&#8208;Valent FeIV&#8208;Oxo Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The saddling structure of the porphyrin ring can not only promote the coordination of the ROOH to the iron center but also give a significant push effect to facilitate the homolysis of the O&#8722;O bond of FeIII&#8208;OOR complexes into high&#8208;valent iron(IV)oxo compounds. The deformation&#8208;induced electronic effect provides heme&#8208;containing peroxidases with another potential mechanism for the O&#8722;O bond cleavage of FeIIIOOH to form high&#8208;valent iron(IV)&#8208;oxo species.







Abstract
Saddle&#8208;shaped hemes have been discovered in the structures of most peroxidases. How such a macrocycle deformation affects the reaction of FeIII hemes with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to form high&#8208;valent Fe&#8208;oxo species remains uncertain. Through examination of the ESI&#8208;MS spectra, absorption changes and 1H NMR chemical shifts, we investigated the reactions of two FeIII porphyrins with different degrees of saddling deformation, namely FeIII(OETPP)ClO4 (1OE) and FeIII(OMTPP)ClO4 (1OM), with tert&#8208;butyl hydroperoxide (tBuOOH) in CH2Cl2 at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, which quickly resulted in O&#8722;O bond homolysis from a highly unstable FeIII&#8208;alkylperoxo intermediate, FeIII&#8208;O(H)OR (2) into FeIV&#8208;oxo porphyrins (3). Insight into the reaction mechanism was obtained from [tBuOOH]&#8208;dependent kinetics. At &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, the reaction of 1OE with tBuOOH exhibited an equilibrium constant (Ka=362.3&#8197;M&#8722;1) and rate constant (k=1.87&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;sM&#8722;&gt;1) for the homolytic cleavage of the 2 O&#8722;O bond that were 2.1 and 1.4 times higher, respectively, than those exhibited by 1OM (Ka=171.8&#8197;M&#8722;1 and k=1.36&#215;10&#8722;2&#8201;&#8201;s&#8722;1). DFT calculations indicated that an FeIII porphyrin with greater saddling deformation can achieve a higher HOMO ([Fe(d
,d
)&#8208;porphyrin(a2u)]) to strengthen the orbital interaction with the LUMO (O&#8722;O bond &#963;*) to facilitate O&#8722;O cleavage.

         <title>Understanding of Photo&#8208;Induced Reversible Rearrangement from Borepin to Borirane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;reference calculations with the CASPT2//CASSCF method have established detailed mechanisms for the photo&#8208;induced reversible isomerization between a borepin and a borirane, in which the (S1/S0)x intersection seam plays crucial roles.







Abstract
The first reversible photoisomerization between a borepin and a borirane was reported in the photo&#8208;induced reactions of B(npy)Ar2 (npy=2&#8208;(naphthalen&#8208;1&#8208;yl) pyridine, Ar=phenyl or electron rich aryl; S. Wang, et&#8197;al. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2019, 58, 6683&#8211;6687). In this work, the detailed mechanisms of the unprecedented reversible photoisomerization between the borepin (compound a) and the borirane (compound b) of B(npy)Ph2 in the first excited singlet (S1) state and the ground (S0) state were studied by carrying out calculations with the complete active space self&#8208;consistent field (CASSCF) and its second&#8208;order perturbation (CASPT2) methods combined with time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT). The calculation results show that photoexcitation of a&#8208;S0 at 365&#8197;nm and b&#8208;S0 at 450&#8197;nm populate their S1 state with evident charge transfer characteristics. The photoisomerization is triggered in the S1 state and ends in the S0 state, at which the intersection points in a (S1/S0)x intersection seam participate in and promote phenyl migration and ring&#8208;closure processes. Furthermore, we reveal that the not large energy difference (less than 0.6&#8197;eV) and similar conjugation properties of &#960; electrons between a&#8208;S0 and b&#8208;S0 are responsible for their unique photo&#8208;reversible reactivity, compared with those of the isomers of the thermally reversible compound B(ppy)Mes2. Our results contribute to an understanding of the excited&#8208;state reactivity of organoboron compounds and will be useful to support the design of new boron&#8208;based photo&#8208;responsive materials.

         <title>Rational Tuning of the Reactivity of Three&#8208;Membered Heterocycle Ring&#8208;Openings via SN2 Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of small molecule covalent inhibitors and probes continuously pushes the rapidly evolving field of chemical biology forward. A key element in these molecular tool compounds is the &#8220;electrophilic trap&#8221; that allows for a covalent linkage with the target enzyme. The reactivity of this entity needs to be well balanced to effectively trap the desired enzyme, while not being attacked by off&#8208;target nucleophiles. We here investigate the intrinsic reactivity of substrates containing a class of widely used electrophilic traps, the three&#8208;membered heterocycles with an N&#8208; (aziridine), P&#8208; (phosphirane), O&#8208; (epoxide) and S&#8208;atom (thiirane) as heteroatom. Using quantum chemical approaches, we studied the conformational flexibility and nucleophilic ring&#8208;opening reaction of a series of model substrates, in which these electrophilic traps are mounted on a cyclohexene scaffold (C6H10Y with Y = NH, PH, O, S). It is revealed that the activation energy of the ring&#8208;opening reaction does not necessarily follow the trend that is expected from C&#8211;Y leaving&#8208;group bond strength, but steeply decreases from NH, to PH, to O, to S. We illustrate that the HOMONu&#8211;LUMOSubstrate interaction is an all&#8208;important factor for the observed reactivity. In addition, we show that the activation energy of aziridines and phosphiranes can be tuned far below that of the corresponding epoxides and thiiranes by the addition of proper electron&#8208;withdrawing ring substituents. Our results provide mechanistic insights to rationally tune the reactivity of this class of popular electrophilic traps and can guide the experimental design of covalent inhibitors and probes for enzymatic activity.</dc:description>

Using quantum chemical approaches, we studied the conformational flexibility and nucleophilic ring-opening reaction of a series of model substrates, in which these electrophilic traps are mounted on a cyclohexene scaffold (C6H10Y with Y = NH, PH, O, S). It is revealed that the activation energy of the ring-opening reaction does not necessarily follow the trend that is expected from C&#8211;Y leaving-group bond strength, but steeply decreases from NH, to PH, to O, to S. We illustrate that the HOMONu&#8211;LUMOSubstrate interaction is an all-important factor for the observed reactivity. In addition, we show that the activation energy of aziridines and phosphiranes can be tuned far below that of the corresponding epoxides and thiiranes by the addition of proper electron-withdrawing ring substituents. Our results provide mechanistic insights to rationally tune the reactivity of this class of popular electrophilic traps and can guide the experimental design of covalent inhibitors and probes for enzymatic activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Time and Atom Economical Regio&#8208; and Chemoselective Radical Cyclization of Unactivated 1,6&#8208;Enynes Under Metal&#8208; and Oxidant&#8208;Free Conditions</title>

Chemical economics! Highly substituted five&#8208;membered heterocyclic compounds were synthesized from unactivated 1,6&#8208;enynes and sulfonyl halides under metal, additive&#8208;free reaction conditions. These transformations can minimize chemical waste, save time, and simplify practical aspects compared to exiting protocols.







Abstract
We developed time&#8208;atom economic regio&#8208; and chemoselective sulfonyl radical triggered 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization of unactivated 1,6&#8208;enynes with sulfonyl halides under metal, additive&#8208;free reaction conditions to achieve highly substituted five&#8208;membered heterocyclic compounds. This transformation creates three new bonds, such as C&#8722;SO2, C&#8722;C, and active C&#8722;I/Br bonds. Importantly, one&#8208;pot protocols produce desired products directly from sodium sulfinates and have an additional advantage such as minimising chemical waste, saving time, and simplifying practical aspects compared to existing protocols.

         <title>Chemically Modified Poly(A) Analogs Targeting PABP: Structure Activity Relationship and Translation Inhibitory Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 42, July 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oligonucleotide mRNA poly(A) tail analogs containing various nucleotide modifications were evaluated as binders for poly(A) binding protein (PABP) using a microscale thermophoresis&#8208;based assay. Their susceptibility to specific degradation by CNOT7 deadenylase was also examined in order to identify best stabilizing modifications. Analogs exhibiting highest affinity and stability were tested in rabbit reticulocyte lysate system and proved to act as efficient translational inhibitors with potential applications in mRNA&#8208;related research.







Abstract
Poly(A)&#8208;binding protein (PABP) is an essential element of cellular translational machinery. Recent studies have revealed that poly(A) tail modifications can modulate mRNA stability and translational potential, and that oligoadenylate&#8208;derived PABP ligands can act as effective translational inhibitors with potential applications in pain management. Although extensive research has focused on protein&#8208;RNA and protein&#8208;protein interactions involving PABPs, further studies are required to examine the ligand specificity of PABP. In this study, we developed a microscale thermophoresis&#8208;based assay to probe the interactions between PABP and oligoadenylate analogs containing different chemical modifications. Using this method, we evaluated oligoadenylate analogs modified with nucleobase, ribose, and phosphate moieties to identify modification hotspots. In addition, we determined the susceptibility of the modified oligos to CNOT7 to identify those with the potential for increased cellular stability. Consequently, we selected two enzymatically stable oligoadenylate analogs that inhibit translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysates with a higher potency than a previously reported PABP ligand. We believe that the results presented in this study and the implemented methodology can be capitalized upon in the future development of RNA&#8208;based biological tools.

         <title>Reactions of Mesityl Azide with Ferrocene&#8208;Based N&#8208;Heterocyclic Germylenes, Stannylenes and Plumbylenes, Including PPh2&#8208;Functionalised Congeners</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 42, July 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The active PbII/P Lewis pair nature of a PPh2&#8208;functionalised ferrocene&#8208;based N&#8208;heterocyclic plumbylene is demonstrated by its reaction with mesityl azide to afford a phosphazide, which is in contrast to the inertness of the unfunctionalised congener. The lighter analogues most likely react with MesN3 at their respective tetrel atom EII, leading to the formation of N2 and an EIV=NMes unit, followed by NMes transfer from the EIV to the PIII atom.







Abstract
The reactivity of ferrocene&#8208;based N&#8208;heterocyclic tetrylenes [{Fe(&#951;5&#8722;C5H4&#8722;NSitBuMe2)2}E] (E=Ge, Sn, Pb) towards mesityl azide (MesN3) is compared with that of PPh2&#8208;functionalised congeners exhibiting two possible reaction sites, namely the EII and PIII atom. For E=Ge and Sn the reaction occurs at the EII atom, leading to the formation of N2 and an EIV=NMes unit. The germanimines are sufficiently stable for isolation. The stannanimines furnish follow&#8208;up products, either by [2+3] cycloaddition with MesN3 or, in the PPh2&#8208;substituted case, by NMes transfer from the SnIV to the PIII atom. Whereas [{Fe(&#951;5&#8722;C5H4&#8722;NSitBuMe2)2}Pb] and other diaminoplumbylenes studied are inert even under forcing conditions, the PPh2&#8208;substituted congener forms an addition product with MesN3, thus showing a behaviour similar to that of frustrated Lewis pairs. The germylenes of this study afford copper(I) complexes with CuCl, including the first structurally characterised linear dicoordinate halogenido complex [CuX(L)] with a heavier tetrylene ligand L.

         <title>Electrochemistry and Reactivity of Chelation&#8208;stabilized Hypervalent Bromine(III) Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 42, July 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite their promising properties, hypervalent bromine(III) reagents remain underexplored due to their low stability and difficult preparation. A fresh approach involves chelation&#8208;stabilized bromine(III) species which are conveniently prepared by electro&#8208;oxidation of parent bromoarenes. The intrinsic Br(III) reactivity can be unlocked in the presence of acids. In this mechanistic study, electrochemical synthesis, redox properties, and chemical reactivity aspects of chelation&#8208;stabilized hypervalent bromine(III) species are disclosed.







Abstract
Hypervalent bromine(III) reagents possess a higher electrophilicity and a stronger oxidizing power compared to their iodine(III) counterparts. Despite the superior reactivity, bromine(III) reagents have a reputation of hard&#8208;to&#8208;control and difficult&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize compounds. This is partly due to their low stability, and partly because their synthesis typically relies on the use of the toxic and highly reactive BrF3 as a precursor. Recently, we proposed chelation&#8208;stabilized hypervalent bromine(III) compounds as a possible solution to both problems. First, they can be conveniently prepared by electro&#8208;oxidation of the corresponding bromoarenes. Second, the chelation endows bromine(III) species with increased stability while retaining sufficient reactivity, comparable to that of iodine(III) counterparts. Finally, their intrinsic reactivity can be unlocked in the presence of acids. Herein, an in&#8208;depth mechanistic study of both the electrochemical generation and the reactivity of the bromine(III) compounds is disclosed, with implications for known applications and future developments in the field.

         <title>Layered Uranyl Phosphonates Encapsulating Co(II)/Mn(II)/Zn(II) Ions: Exfoliation into Nanosheets and Its Impact on Magnetic and Luminescent Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 42, July 26, 2022. </description>

Layered heterometallic uranyl phosphonates [(UO2)3M(2&#8208;pmbH)4(H2O)4]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O [MU, M=Co(II), CoU; Mn(II), MnU; Zn(II), ZnU] can be exfoliated into nanosheets with single/two&#8208;layer thickness (MU&#8208;ns). Comparing to the bulk crystalline samples, the aggregates of nanosheets exhibited significant differences in magnetic dynamics (for CoU) and photoluminescence (for ZnU).







Abstract
Layered heterometallic 5f&#8211;3d uranyl phosphonates can exhibit unique luminescent and/or magnetic properties, but the fabrication and properties of their 2D counterparts have not been investigated. Herein we report three heterobimetallic uranyl phosphonates, namely, [(UO2)3M(2&#8208;pmbH)4(H2O)4]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O [MU, M=Co(II), CoU; Mn(II), MnU; Zn(II), ZnU; 2&#8208;pmbH3=2&#8208;(phosphonomethyl)benzoic acid]. They are isostructural and display two&#8208;dimensional layered structures where the M(II) centers are encapsulated inside the windows generated by the diamagnetic uranyl phosphonate layer. Each M(II) has an octahedral geometry filled with four water molecules in the equatorial positions and two phosphonate oxygen atoms in the axial positions. The uranium atoms adopt UO7 pentagonal bipyramidal and UO6 square bipyramidal geometries. The lattice and coordination water molecules can be released by thermal treatment and reabsorbed in a reversible manner, accompanied with changes of magnetic dynamics. Interestingly, the bulk samples of MU can be exfoliated in acetone via freezing and thawing processes forming nanosheets with single&#8208;layer or two&#8208;layer thickness (MU&#8208;ns). Magnetic studies revealed that the CoU and MnU systems exhibited field&#8208;induced slow magnetization relaxation at low temperature. Compared with crystalline CoU, the magnetic relaxation of the CoU&#8208;ns aggregates is significantly accelerated. Moreover, photoluminescence measured at 77&#8197;K showed slight red&#8208;shift of the five characteristic uranyl emission bands for ZnU&#8208;ns in comparison with those of the crystalline ZnU. This work gives the first examples of 2D materials based on 5f&#8211;3d heterometallic uranyl phosphonates and illustrates the impact of dimension reduction on their magnetic/optical properties.

Small rings: The catalytic asymmetric synthesis of highly functionalized cyclopropanes from &#945;&#8208;substituted allyl sulfones is described. The methodology, using &#945;&#8208;aryl diazoacetates or diacceptor diazo reagents, catalyzed by a chiral rhodium complex furnished the corresponding cyclopropanes in high yields with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enatioselectivities.







Abstract
The catalytic asymmetric synthesis of highly functionalized cyclopropanes from &#945;&#8208;substituted allyl sulfones and silanes is reported. The reaction, using &#945;&#8208;aryl diazoacetates or diacceptor diazo reagents, catalyzed by a chiral rhodium complex (Rh2((S)&#8208;BTPCP)4), furnished the corresponding cyclopropanes in moderate to high yields (27&#8211;97&#8201;%), high diastereoselectivities (68&#8201;:&#8201;32 to 20&#8201;:&#8201;1 d.r.) and moderate to excellent ee (40&#8211;99&#8201;%). This methodology offers a privileged access to an underexplored class of enantioenriched cyclopropanes with a high level of functionality, an asset for further post&#8208;functionalization and their incorporation into more complex structure.

         <title>Electrochemical Behaviour and Chemical Species of Sm(II) in AlCl3&#8208;NaCl with Different Lewis Acidity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 42, July 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sm(II) diffuses faster with the increase of Lewis acidity of AlCl3&#8208;NaCl, which is due to the different coordination circumstance of Sm(II). With the Lewis acidity increase, the anions involved in Sm(II) complexation gradually range from Cl&#8722; to AlCl4&#8722; and Al2Cl7&#8722;. The difference of complex structure is also reflected in the in&#8197;situ UV&#8208;Vis absorption spectrum.







Abstract
AlCl3&#8208;NaCl was utilized as an electrolyte in this work due to its low melting point and Lewis acidity, in which samarium exists in two oxidation states, Sm(III) and Sm(II), resulting in unique electrochemical behaviours. Sm metal dissolves in AlCl3&#8208;NaCl melt to form SmCl2, which is verified by electrochemical and spectroscopic techniques. As the Lewis acidity of the melt increases, the diffusion coefficient of Sm(II) gradually increases, and the activation energy of diffusion decreases. Moreover, an additional co&#8208;reduction peak of Sm3+ and AlCl4&#8722; is observed to be more positive than that of Al(0)/Al(III) in Lewis basic melt, which may be tightly correlated with the variation of Sm(II) coordination in AlCl3&#8208;NaCl melt and ligand variation from Cl&#8722; to AlCl4&#8722; and Al2Cl7&#8722; as the Lewis acidity of the AlCl3&#8208;NaCl melt increases, according to the in&#8197;situ electronic absorption spectra of Sm in this melt.

         <title>Ammonia Borane, NH3BH3: A Threshold Photoelectron&#8211;Photoion Coincidence Study of a Potential Hydrogen&#8208;Storage Material</title>

         <dc:description>
The threshold photoelectron spectrum of ammonia borane NH3BH3 is reported. We determined an ionization energy of 9.26&#177;0.03&#8197;eV and observed a pronounced vibrational progression. In addition, the dissociation energy of the B&#8722;H bond was determined to be 419&#177;10&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1. The electronic situation of NH3BH3 is compared to its hydrocarbon analogue ethane.







Abstract
We have investigated the photoionization of ammonia borane (AB) and determined adiabatic ionization energy to be 9.26&#177;0.03&#8197;eV for the X+ 2E&#8592;X 1A1 transition. Although the threshold photoelectron spectrum appears at first glance to be similar to the one of the isosteric ethane, the electronic situation differs markedly, due to different orbital energies. In addition, an appearance energy AE0K(NH3BH3, NH3BH2+)= 10.00&#177;0.03&#8197;eV has been determined, corresponding to the loss of a hydrogen atom at the BH3&#8208;site. From the data, a 0&#8197;K bond dissociation energy for the B&#8722;H bond in the cation of 71.5&#177;3&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 was derived, whereas the one in the neutral compound has been estimated to be 419&#177;10&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1.

&lt;p&gt;We have investigated the photoionization of ammonia borane (AB) and determined adiabatic ionization energy to be 9.26&#177;0.03&#8197;eV for the X&lt;sup&gt;+ 2&lt;/sup&gt;E&#8592;X &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; transition. Although the threshold photoelectron spectrum appears at first glance to be similar to the one of the isosteric ethane, the electronic situation differs markedly, due to different orbital energies. In addition, an appearance energy AE&lt;sub&gt;0K&lt;/sub&gt;(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;BH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)= 10.00&#177;0.03&#8197;eV has been determined, corresponding to the loss of a hydrogen atom at the BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-site. From the data, a 0&#8197;K bond dissociation energy for the B&#8722;H bond in the cation of 71.5&#177;3&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; was derived, whereas the one in the neutral compound has been estimated to be 419&#177;10&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Triangular Arrangement of Ferromagnetic Iron Chains in the High&#8208;TC Ferromagnet TiFe1&#8722;xOs2+xB2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 42, July 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stacks of alternating (Fe/Os)3 triangles induce ferromagnetic ordering at elevated temperatures in the new transition metal boride TiFe1&#8722;xOs2+xB2. The Curie temperature TC=523(2)&#8197;K and the Weiss constant of 554(3)&#8197;K reflect the strong ferromagnetic exchange interactions within and between the Fe3 triangles as found by DFT calculations.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal borides (TMBs) containing Bn&#8208;fragment (n&gt;3) have recently gained interest for their ability to enable exciting magnetic materials. Herein, we show that the B4&#8208;containing TiFe0.64(1)Os2.36(1)B2 is a new ferromagnetic TMB with a Curie temperature of 523(2)&#8197;K and a Weiss constant of 554(3)&#8197;K, originating from the chain of M3&#8208;triangles (M=64&#8201;%Fe+36&#8201;%Os). The new phase was synthesized from the elements by arc&#8208;melting, and its structure was elucidated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. It belongs to the Ti1+xOs2&#8722;xRuB2&#8208;type structure (space group P
2&#8197;m, no. 189) and contains trigonal&#8208;planar B4 boron fragments [B&#8722;B distance of 1.87(4)&#8197;&#197;] interacting with M3&#8208;triangles [M&#8211;M distances of 2.637(8)&#8197;&#197; and 3.0199(2)&#8197;&#197;]. The experimental results were supported by computational calculations based on the ideal TiFeOs2B2 composition, which revealed strong ferromagnetic interactions within and between the Fe3&#8208;triangles. This discovery represents the first magnetically ordered Os&#8208;rich TMB, thus it will help expand our knowledge of the role of Os in low&#8208;dimensional magnetism of intermetallics and enable the design of such materials in the future.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Borylation of Acyl Chlorides with an Alkoxy Diboron Reagent: A Facile Route to Acylboron Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 42, July 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper&#8208;catalyzed borylation of acyl chlorides with B2pin2 in the presence of LiOt&#8208;Bu at room temperature provides a convenient synthetic approach to various acylboron compounds with good functional group tolerance. The synthetic utility is demonstrated by the late&#8208;stage derivatization of drug molecules and the ease of scale&#8208;up. A catalytic mechanism is proposed based on in&#8197;situ reaction monitoring and the structural characterization of a key acylboronate intermediate and a novel Cu complex byproduct.







Abstract
Herein, the copper&#8208;catalyzed borylation of readily available acyl chlorides with bis(pinacolato)diboron, (B2pin2) or bis(neopentane glycolato)diboron (B2neop2) is reported, which provides stable potassium acyltrifluoroborates (KATs) in good yields from the acylboronate esters. A variety of functional groups are tolerated under the mild reaction conditions (room temperature) and substrates containing different carbon&#8208;skeletons, such as aryl, heteroaryl and primary, secondary, tertiary alkyl are applicable. Acyl N&#8208;methyliminodiacetic acid (MIDA) boronates can also been accessed by modification of the workup procedures. This process is scalable and also amenable to the late&#8208;stage conversion of carboxylic acid&#8208;containing drugs into their acylboron analogues, which have been challenging to prepare previously. A catalytic mechanism is proposed based on in&#8197;situ monitoring of the reaction between p&#8208;toluoyl chloride and an NHC&#8208;copper(I) boryl complex as well as the isolation of an unusual lithium acylBpinOBpin compound as a key intermediate.

         <title>Driving the Active Site Incorporation in Zeolitic Materials via the Organic Structure&#8208;Directing Agent Through Development of H&#8208;Bonds with Hydroxyl Groups</title>

(1S,2S)&#8208;N&#8208;methyl&#8208;pseudoephedrine used as organic structure&#8208;directing agent for the synthesis of Mg&#8208;doped aluminophosphates is able to control the spatial distribution of low&#8208;valent dopants through the development of H&#8208;bonds with MgO4 tetrahedra, providing a new strategy for controlling the active site spatial distribution in zeolite catalysts.







Abstract
(1S,2S)&#8208;N&#8208;methyl&#8208;pseudoephedrine (MPS) was used as organic structure&#8208;directing agent (OSDA) for the synthesis of Mg&#8208;doped nanoporous aluminophosphates. This molecule displays a particular conformational behavior, where the presence of H&#8208;bond donor and acceptor groups provide a rigid conformational space with one asymmetric conformation preferentially occurring. MPS drives the crystallization of Mg&#8208;containing AFI materials. Characterization of these materials shows that the OSDA incorporate as protonated species, arranged as head&#8208;to&#8208;tail monomers. Combination of three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction with high&#8208;resolution synchrotron powder X&#8208;ray diffraction allowed to locate both the Mg and the organic species. Interestingly, results showed that the spatial incorporation of Mg is driven by the hydroxyl groups of the organic cation through the development of H&#8208;bonds with negatively&#8208;charged MgO4 tetrahedra. This work demonstrates that H&#8208;bond forming groups can be used to drive the spatial incorporation of low&#8208;valent dopants within zeolitic frameworks, a highly desired aim in order to control their catalytic activity and selectivity.

         <title>Utility of 2&#8208;Diphenylphosphoryloxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;Dienes in Multicomponent Hetero&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions to Construct Functionalized Six&#8208;Membered Nitrogen Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 42, July 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
2&#8208;Diphenylphosphoryloxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes participate in three&#8208;component, BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2&#8208;promoted hetero&#8208;Diels Alder reactions with aldehydes and protected amines to produce functionalized piperidenes. The advantages of this method include the stability of the enol phosphate functional group in both the 1,3&#8208;diene starting material and in the cycloaddition product, its ease of use as no special solvent or atmosphere manipulations are required, and the synthetic usefulness of the enol phosphate functional group as an electrophilic cross&#8208;coupling partner after the cycloaddition.







Abstract
The utility of 2&#8208;diphenylphosphoryloxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes for the construction of substituted six&#8208;membered nitrogen heterocycles is presented. These dienes undergo boron trifluoride&#8208;promoted aza&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reactions when reacted with imines or related species formed in&#8197;situ using aldehydes and amine derivatives. The stability of the dienes allows this three&#8208;component reaction to be carried out with no special precautions to eliminate water or air.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2-Diphenylphosphoryloxy-1,3-dienes&lt;/b&gt; participate in three-component, BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-promoted hetero-Diels Alder reactions with aldehydes and protected amines to produce functionalized piperidenes. The advantages of this method include the stability of the enol phosphate functional group in both the 1,3-diene starting material and in the cycloaddition product, its ease of use as no special solvent or atmosphere manipulations are required, and the synthetic usefulness of the enol phosphate functional group as an electrophilic cross-coupling partner after the cycloaddition.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The utility of 2-diphenylphosphoryloxy-1,3-dienes for the construction of substituted six-membered nitrogen heterocycles is presented. These dienes undergo boron trifluoride-promoted aza-Diels&#8211;Alder reactions when reacted with imines or related species formed in&#8197;situ using aldehydes and amine derivatives. The stability of the dienes allows this three-component reaction to be carried out with no special precautions to eliminate water or air. Thirty-one examples of this process are presented. The usefulness of the enol phosphate functional group is highlighted in further reactions after the cycloaddition step to generate functionalized piperidenes or pyridines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Positive Cooperativity Induced by Interstrand Interactions in Silver(I) Complexes with &#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;Diimine Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 42, July 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Big softie: AgI ([Kr]4d10) possesses similar electronic structure to CuI ([Ar]3d10), but a larger ionic radius and increased covalency when bound to soft &#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;diimine ligands. Consequently, the thermodynamic formation of unsaturated [AgI(&#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;diimine)]+ complexes is favored in organic solvents. Moreover, the addition of a second bidentate ligand to give saturated pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral [AgI(&#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;diimine)2]+ building blocks is driven by positive allosteric cooperativity when the ligands are decorated with terminal methyl groups.







Abstract
The allosteric positive cooperativity accompanying the formation of compact [CuI(&#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;diimine)2]+ building blocks contributed to the historically efficient synthesis of metal&#8208;containing catenates and knotted assemblies. However, its limited magnitude can easily be overcome by the negative chelate cooperativity that controls the overall formation of related polymetallic multistranded helicates and grids. Despite the more abundant use of analogous dioxygen&#8208;resistant [AgI(&#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;diimine)2]+ units in modern entangled metallo&#8208;supramolecular assemblies, a related thermodynamic justification was absent. Solid&#8208;state structural characterizations show the successive formation of [AgI(&#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;diimine)(CH3CN)][X] and [AgI(&#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;diimine)2][X] upon the stepwise reactions of &#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;diimine=2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (bpy) or 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (phen) derivatives with AgX (X=BF4&#8722;, ClO4&#8722;, PF6&#8722;). In room&#8208;temperature, 5&#8211;10&#8197;mM acetonitrile solutions, these cationic complexes exist as mixtures in fast exchange on the NMR timescale. Spectrophotometric titrations using the unsubstituted bpy and phen ligands point to the statistical (=non&#8208;cooperative) binding of two successive bidentate ligands around AgI, a mechanism probably driven by the formation of hydrophobic belts, that overcomes the unfavorable decrease in the positive charge borne by the metallic cation. Surprisingly, the addition of methyl groups adjacent to the nitrogen donors (6,6&#8242; positions in dmbpy; 2,9 positions in dmphen) induces positive cooperativity for the formation of [Ag(dmbpy)2]+ and [Ag(dmphen)2]+, a trend assigned to additional stabilizing interligand interactions. Adding rigid and polarizable phenyl side arms in [Ag(Brdmbpy)2]+ further reinforces the positively cooperative process, while limiting the overall decrease in metal&#8211;ligand affinity.

The catalytic enantioselective protonation of &#945;&#8208;oxygenated (2&#8208;azaaryl)methyl anions generated through the formal umpolung addition of the anion of dialkyl phosphites to 2&#8208;azaaryl ketones utilizing the [1,2]&#8208;phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement was demonstrated with chiral bis(guanidino)iminophosphorane organosuperbase. This is a rare example of the catalytic enantioselective protonation of transient carbanions other than enolates, constructing a trisubstituted stereogenic center &#945; to 2&#8208;azaarenes.







Abstract
The formal enantioselective umpolung addition of dialkyl phosphites to 2&#8208;azaaryl ketones was developed under Br&#248;nsted base catalysis. The reaction involves the enantioselective protonation of the transient &#945;&#8208;oxygenated (2&#8208;azaaryl)methyl anion generated through the 1,2&#8208;addition of the anion of dialkyl phosphite to the 2&#8208;azaaryl ketone and the subsequent [1,2]&#8208;phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement. A chiral bis(guanidino)iminophosphorane organosuperbase efficiently catalyzed the reaction to provide enantio&#8208;enriched phosphates in high yields with good to high enantioselectivities. This is a rare example of the catalytic enantioselective protonation of transient carbanions other than enolates, constructing a trisubstituted stereogenic center &#945; to 2&#8208;azaarenes.

         <title>Different Enzyme Conformations Induce Different Mechanistic Traits in HIV&#8208;1 Protease</title>

         <dc:description>
Convergence and divergence: Using multiple conformations (previously characterized by adiabatic methods) and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics molecular dynamics simulations, we assessed the convergence of activation free energies and the mechanistic divergence of the first step in the reaction catalysed by HIV&#8208;1 protease. The mechanistic divergence for this step was still present and our barriers spanned a range of 5&#8197;kcal&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1.







Abstract
The influence of the dynamical flexibility of enzymes on reaction mechanisms is a cornerstone in biological sciences. In this study, we aim to 1)&#8197;study the convergence of the activation free energy by using the first step of the reaction catalysed by HIV&#8208;1 protease as a case study, and 2)&#8197;provide further evidence for a mechanistic divergence in this enzyme, as two different reaction pathways were seen to contribute to this step. We used quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics molecular dynamics simulations, on four different initial conformations that led to different barriers in a previous study. Despite the sampling, the four activation free energies still spanned a range of 5.0&#8197;kcal&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1. Furthermore, the new simulations did confirm the occurrence of an unusual mechanistic divergence, with two different mechanistic pathways displaying equivalent barriers. An active&#8208;site water molecule is proposed to influence the mechanistic pathway.

New strategies to address climate change are more urgent than ever. A molecular metallo&#8208;organic bifunctional material with covalently attached photo&#8208;active and redox units led to synchronous light harvesting and energy storage functions. As cathode material in a two&#8208;electrode Li photo&#8208;battery configuration, the storage capacity increased by 100&#8201;%, under 470&#8197;nm illumination with output power of 4.0&#8197;mW/cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Controlling redox activity of judiciously appended redox units on a photo&#8208;sensitive molecular core is an effective strategy for visible light energy harvesting and storage. The first example of a photosensitizer &#8208; electron donor coordination compound in which the photoinduced electron transfer step is used for light to electrical energy conversion and storage is reported. A photo&#8208;responsive Ru&#8208;diimine module conjugated with redox&#8208;active catechol groups in [Ru(II)(phenanthroline&#8208;5,6&#8208;diolate)3]4&#8722; photosensitizer can mediate photoinduced catechol to dione oxidation in the presence of a sacrificial electron acceptor or at the surface of an electrode. Under potentiostatic condition, visible light triggered current density enhancement confirmed the light harvesting ability of this photosensitizer. Upon implementation in galvanostatic charge&#8208;discharge of a Li battery configuration, the storage capacity was found to be increased by 100&#8201;%, under 470&#8197;nm illumination with output power of 4.0&#8197;mW/cm&#8722;2. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept molecular system marks an important milestone towards a new generation of molecular photo&#8208;rechargeable materials.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;New strategies&lt;/b&gt; to address climate change are more urgent than ever. A molecular metallo-organic bifunctional material with covalently attached photo-active and redox units led to synchronous light harvesting and energy storage functions. As cathode material in a two-electrode Li photo-battery configuration, the storage capacity increased by 100&#8201;%, under 470&#8197;nm illumination with output power of 4.0&#8197;mW/cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

Because of its large size and its optimized covalency toward heterocyclic N&#8208;donor atoms, the intermediate [AgIL]+ unit (depicted as a paraglider) is eager to catch a second &#945;,&#945;&#8217;&#8208;diimine ligands coming down from the summit of positive allosteric coperativity. The final stable [AgIL2]+ complex reaches the Valley of Stability. More information can be found in the Research Article by D. Zare, C. Piguet, E.&#8197;C. Constable et&#8197;al.

Strategies and applications of nitrogen&#8208;containing functional groups to construct hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) materials: selectivity of pore modification effects of nitrogen&#8208;containing functional groups in gas adsorption separation and guest recognition applications, nitrogen&#8208;modification of framework to promote HOFs for sensing applications in optics, and biocompatibility of nitrogen&#8208;containing functional groups to advance the biomedical field of HOF materials.







Abstract
The construction of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework materials by intermolecular hydrogen bonding forces has been rapidly developed in the last decade, among which, the strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding and functional binding sites exhibited by nitrogen&#8208;containing functional groups have made them favorites for designing organic components to customize functionalized porous materials. This review systematically introduces the types of nitrogen&#8208;containing monomers used to prepare porous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic backbones and the principles of their construction, summarizes the design advantages of crystalline materials from an elemental perspective, and presents the applications of such HOFs in the fields of gas adsorption/separation, molecular recognition, plasmonic conductivity, biomedical, and luminescent materials, etc. Finally, the prospects for the development of such materials are discussed and potential directions for future work are analyzed.

         <title>Development of a Bacterial Enzyme&#8208;Based Biosensor for the Detection and Quantification of Selenate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective for selenate: An enzyme&#8208;based selenate reductase sensor has been developed for the detection of selenate. Under optimum conditions, the calibration curve was linear up to 3900.0&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 with a detection limit of 4.97&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;L&#8722;1. The recovery of selenate in real water samples was analyzed and the sensor's reliability was confirmed. None of SO42&#8722;, NO3&#8722;, NO2&#8722;, PO43&#8722; or AsO43&#8722; interfaces with selenate quantification.







Abstract
An enzymatic biosensor has been developed for the determination of selenate (SeO42&#8722;), in which selenate reductase (SeR) is chemically attached to a gold disk electrode by lipoic acid N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide ester as linker, allowing the catalytic reduction of the SeO42&#8722; to SeO32&#8722;. Modification of the gold electrode was characterized by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF&#8208;SIMS), and electrochemistry. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) measurements were performed in different buffers for selenate determination. Under optimum conditions, the calibration curve was linear over the range 7.0&#8211;3900.0&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 with limits of detection and quantification of 4.97 and 15.56&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;L&#8722;1, respectively. The possible interference of the relevant oxyanions SO42&#8722;, NO3&#8722;, NO2&#8722;, PO43&#8722; and AsO43&#8722; in the determination of SeO42&#8722; was studied. Finally, the proposed biosensor was used to determine SeO42&#8722; with recovery between 95.2 and 102.4&#8201;% in different real water samples.

         <title>General Design Strategy of Anti&#8208;aromatic Porphyrinoids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We summarized six strategies to construct a high anti&#8208;aromatic porphyrinoid: 1)&#8197;Constructing a (4n) &#960;&#8208;electron anti&#8208;aromatic system; 2)&#8197;Increasing the number of pyrrole/thiophene/furan units on the &#960;&#8208;electron current ring flowing pipe; 3)&#8197;The heteroatom selecting order is &#8722;O&#8722; (optimal choice), &#8722;NH&#8722; (second choice), and &#8722;S&#8722; (last choice); 4)&#8197;The C&#8722;C=C&#8722;C unit is not beneficial for the anti&#8208;aromatic properties; 5)&#8197;Avoiding the crowded groups in the core space of an anti&#8208;aromatic macrocycle; 6)&#8197;The &#8220;circular&#8221; macrocycle is the best skeleton.







Abstract
A systematic investigation to arrange the typical anti&#8208;aromatic porphyrinoids in sequence was performed. Based on density functional theory calculations, six rules are summarized to obtain the high&#8208;performance anti&#8208;aromatic porphyrinoids: (1)&#8197;when two atoms are deleted/added on the 18&#960; electron current ring flowing pipe, we will immediately obtain a 16&#960;/20&#960; electron anti&#8208;aromatic system; (2)&#8197;it is a good idea to increase the number of pyrrole/thiophen/furan units on the &#960;&#8208;electron current ring flowing pipe; (3)&#8197;the heteroatom selecting order is &#8722;O&#8722; (optimal choice), &#8722;NH&#8722; (second choice), and &#8722;S&#8722; (last choice); (4)&#8197;it is worth noting that the C&#8722;C=C&#8722;C unit is not beneficial for the anti&#8208;aromatic properties; (5)&#8197;it is very significant to avoid the crowded environment in the core space of an anti&#8208;aromatic molecule. In this view, &#8722;O&#8722; is much better than &#8722;S&#8722; and &#8722;NH&#8722;; (6)&#8197;the &#8220;circular&#8221; skeleton is much better than an &#8220;ellipse&#8208;like&#8221;, &#8220;rectangular&#8221;, or &#8220;parallelogram&#8208;like&#8221; one.

         <title>From Nanoparticle Ensembles to Single Nanoparticles: Techniques for the Investigation of Plasmon Enhanced Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The progress of plasmon enhanced electrochemistry (PEEC) in terms of three types of electrochemical methods (macroscopic PEEC measurements, PEEC based on scanning electrochemical microscope, and PEEC based on nano&#8208;impact electrochemistry) is discussed in this Concept article.







Abstract
Plasmon enhanced electrochemistry (PEEC), where specific electrochemical reactions are promoted due to the reduced energy barrier of the reaction processes by the light excited &#8220;hot carriers&#8221; of the plasmonic nanoparticles, has aroused tremendous interest in recent years. A deep understanding of the PEEC process becomes a key issue for facilitating PEEC catalyst design and improving PEEC performance. This concept article begins with a brief discussion of the macroscopic electrochemical method of PEEC study of the plasmonic nanoparticle ensembles. Following that, we highlight two electrochemical techniques that may possess single nanoparticle sensitivity, i.&#8201;e., scanning electrochemical microscope and nano&#8208;impact electrochemistry. The pros and cons of each technique are discussed and an outlook is given. We hope to provide the readers with the current status of PEEC to evoke reflections regarding the reaction mechanisms, performance improvement, and the utilizations to important systems.

         <title>Proton Conduction at High Temperature in High&#8208;Symmetry Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Molecular Crystals of RuIII Complexes with Six Imidazole&#8208;Imidazolate Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new H&#8208;bonded crystal of [RuIII(Him)3(Im)3](1) with six HIm (imidazole) was prepared so as to obtain a high&#8208;temperature proton conductor. The crystal is constructed through N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N&#8722;H&#8208;bonds between the inter&#8208;RuIII complexes and has a rare Icy&#8208;c* cubic net without crystal anisotropy. The proton conductivity is due not only to rotations and hopping motions of HIm, but also induced by isotropic whole&#8208;molecule rotation of 1.







Abstract
A new H&#8208;bonded crystal [RuIII(Him)3(Im)3] with three imidazole (Him) and three imidazolate (Im&#8722;) groups was prepared to obtain a higher&#8208;temperature proton conductor than a Nafion membrane with water driving. The crystal is constructed by complementary N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N H&#8208;bonds between the RuIII complexes and has a rare Icy&#8208;c* cubic network topology with a twofold interpenetration without crystal anisotropy. The crystals show a proton conductivity of 3.08&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 450&#8197;K and a faster conductivity than those formed by only HIms. The high proton conductivity is attributed to not only molecular rotations and hopping motions of HIm frameworks that are activated at &#8764;113&#8197;K, but also isotropic whole&#8208;molecule rotation of [RuIII(Him)3(Im)3] at temperatures greater than 420&#8197;K. The latter rotation was confirmed by solid&#8208;state 2H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy; probable proton conduction routes were predicted and theoretically considered.

         <title>Chemoselective Acylation of Nucleosides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemoselective functionalization of oxygen atoms versus nitrogen atoms in bifunctional and polyfunctional molecules is a long&#8208;standing challenge in both fundamental chemistry and in complex molecule synthesis. Different conditions that allow high selectivity in the derivatization of complex nucleosides that contain both O&#8208; and N&#8208;based functionalities are described. Particularly intriguing cases are also presented, in which the reactivity of the O&#8208; and N&#8208;based functionalities is quite context dependent, exhibiting reactivity that blurs conventional considerations, yet where selectivity may also be observed.







Abstract
Acylated nucleoside analogues play an important role in medicinal chemistry and are extremely useful precursors to various other nucleoside analogues. However, chemoselective acylation of nucleosides usually requires several protection and deprotection steps due to the competing nucleophilicity of hydroxy and amino groups. In contrast, direct protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free chemoselective acylation of nucleosides is a preferred strategy due to lower cost and fewer overall synthetic steps. Herein, a simple and efficient chemoselective acylation of nucleosides and nucleotides under mild reaction conditions, giving either O&#8208; or N&#8208;acylated products respectively with excellent chemoselectivity is reported.

         <title>Pyrimidoquinazolinophenanthroline Opens Next Chapter in Design of Bridging Ligands for Artificial Photosynthesis
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new bridging ligand, namely pyrimidoquinazolinophenanthroline pqp, was successfully synthesized by a chemistry on the complex method using cross coupling and dehydrogenation reactions. The twisted geometry of pqp bridges the gap of already existing bridging ligands. Its photophysics can be significantly influenced by the introduction of a second metal center. Furthermore, light&#8208;induced redox catalysis was explored with a pqp&#8208;based dyad.







Abstract
The synthesis and detailed characterization of a new Ru polypyridine complex containing a heteroditopic bridging ligand with previously unexplored metal&#8208;metal distances is presented. Due to the twisted geometry of the novel ligand, the resultant division of the ligand in two distinct subunits leads to steady state as well as excited state properties of the corresponding mononuclear Ru(II) polypyridine complex resembling those of prototype [Ru(bpy)3]2+ (bpy=2,2'&#8208;bipyridine). The localization of the initially optically excited and the nature of the long&#8208;lived excited states on the Ru&#8208;facing ligand spheres is evaluated by resonance Raman and fs&#8208;TA spectroscopy, respectively, and supported by DFT and TDDFT calculations. Coordination of a second metal (Zn or Rh) to the available bis&#8208;pyrimidyl&#8208;like coordination sphere strongly influences the frontier orbitals, apparent by, for example, luminescence quenching. Thus, the new bridging ligand motif offers electronic properties, which can be adjusted by the nature of the second metal center. Using the heterodinuclear Ru&#8722;Rh complex, visible light&#8208;driven reduction of NAD+ to NADH was achieved, highlighting the potential of this system for photocatalytic applications.

         <title>Aggregation Modes of Chiral Diketopyrrolo[3,4&#8208;c]pyrrole Dyes in Solution and Thin Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aggregation modes of four new chiral diketopyrrolo[3,4&#8208;c]pyrrole (DPP) dyes, functionalized with enantiopure alkyl groups from natural sources, were deeply investigated in condition of solution aggregation and thin films by electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectroscopy. ECD revealed superior capability, compared to absorbance spectroscopy, to provide information on the aggregation modes and to detect the possible co&#8208;existence of multiple aggregation pathways.







Abstract
The chiroptical features of chiral diketopyrrolo[3,4&#8208;c]pyrrole (DPP) derivatives have been only marginally investigated to date. In this regard, we have synthesized ad hoc four chiral DPP dyes, functionalized with enantiopure alkyl groups from natural sources either on the lactam moieties or on the terminal positions of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone, to promote an efficient self&#8208;assembly into chiral supramolecular structures. For each of them, the aggregation modes has been investigated by absorbance and ECD spectroscopies in conditions of solution aggregation and on thin films, considering the effects of deposition technique (drop casting vs. spin coating) and post&#8208;deposition operations (solvent and thermal annealing). The effect of the structure of lateral &#960;&#8208;conjugated units attached to the central DPP scaffold, as well as that of the position of the alkyl chiral group, has been assessed. ECD revealed superior capability, compared to absorbance spectroscopy, to provide information on the aggregation modes and to detect the possible co&#8208;existence of multiple aggregation pathways.

         <title>Reactivity of Primary Phosphines and Primary Phosphine Sulfides towards Imines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To P(III) or not to P(III). A three&#8208;component mixture containing primary phosphine, chalcogen, and an imine affords a bis&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminophosphine chalcogenide. Mechanistic studies show an interesting dichotomy between the relative reactivities of P(III) vs. P(V) species towards imines.







Abstract
Reactivity of primary phosphines with two stoichiometric equivalents of imine results in the formation of bis&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminophosphines (2&#8201;a&#8211;e), which can be subsequently oxidized in the presence of S8 or H2O2 to generate air stable bis&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminophosphine sulfides (2&#8201;b&#8211;m(S/O)). To elucidate the mechanism of this three&#8208;component reaction, Hammett analysis, kinetic isotope effect (KIE), and trapping experiments were performed. Ultimately a P(V)&#8211;P(III) tautomerization is invoked, followed by nucleophilic attack by the P(III) species to generate the desired products.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;To P(III) or not to P(III)&lt;/b&gt;. A three-component mixture containing primary phosphine, chalcogen, and an imine affords a bis-&#945;-aminophosphine chalcogenide. Mechanistic studies show an interesting dichotomy between the relative reactivities of P(III) vs. P(V) species towards imines.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reactivity of primary phosphines with two stoichiometric equivalents of imine results in the formation of bis-&#945;-aminophosphines (&lt;b&gt;2&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;e&lt;/b&gt;), which can be subsequently oxidized in the presence of S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; or H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to generate air stable bis-&#945;-aminophosphine sulfides (&lt;b&gt;2&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;m(S/O)&lt;/b&gt;). To elucidate the mechanism of this three-component reaction, Hammett analysis, kinetic isotope effect (KIE), and trapping experiments were performed. Ultimately a P(V)&#8211;P(III) tautomerization is invoked, followed by nucleophilic attack by the P(III) species to generate the desired products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,4,7&#8208;trioxophenalenyl neutral diradical undergoes a &#963;&#8208;dimerization, generating two types of &#963;&#8208;dimers immediately after the preparation. One of the &#963;&#8208;dimers is a close&#8208;shell dimer linked through double&#8208;&#963;&#8208;bonds, and the other one is a peroxy&#8208;linked open&#8208;shell dimer. These &#963;&#8208;dimers are in equilibrium in the solution state by the reversible &#963;&#8208;bond formation/cleavage via the neutral diradical as a key intermediate.







Abstract
A novel neutral diradical of &#960;&#8208;extended phenalenyl derivative having three oxo&#8208;groups, tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,4,7&#8208;trioxophenalenyl, and two types of the corresponding &#963;&#8208;dimers were investigated. Quantum chemical calculations showed that the neutral diradical is in triplet ground state having doubly degenerate singly occupied molecular orbitals. The neutral diradical undergoes a &#963;&#8208;dimerization, generating two types of &#963;&#8208;dimers immediately after the preparation. One of the &#963;&#8208;dimers, which was selectively generated in the crystalline state, was a close&#8208;shell dimer linked through double&#8208;&#963;&#8208;bonds on the phenalenyl skeleton with a long C&#8722;C bond length of 1.66&#8197;&#197;. The other &#963;&#8208;dimer, which existed only in the solution state, was a peroxy&#8208;linked open&#8208;shell dimer in which one &#963;&#8208;bond was formed between two oxygen atoms. Furthermore, the temperature&#8208;dependent 1H&#8197;NMR and ESR spectra revealed that these &#963;&#8208;dimers are in equilibrium in the solution state by the reversible &#963;&#8208;bond formation/cleavage via the neutral diradical as a key intermediate.

         <title>Coordination adaptable networks: zirconium(IV) carboxylates.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vitrimers are 3D &#8220;covalent adaptable networks&#8221; (CANs) with flow properties thanks to thermally activated associative exchange reactions. The present contribution introduces coordination adaptable networks, or CooANs, that are topologically related to metal&#8208;organic frameworks with octahedral Zr  6  clusters as secondary building units in a carboxylic acid&#8208;functionalized acrylate&#8208;methacrylate copolymer matrix. A series of  Zr&#8208;CooAN&#8208;x  materials (x = percent of Zr  6  loading relative to maximum capacity) was synthesized with x = 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50 and 100. The mechanical and rheological investigations demonstrate vitrimer&#8208;like properties for x up to 50, the crosslink migration being ensured by carboxylate ligand exchange, with relaxation becoming slower as the Zr  6  content is increased. The flow activation energy of  Zr&#8208;CooAN&#8208;10  is 92.9 &#177; 3.6 kJ mol  &#8208;1  . Rapid (30 min) hot&#8208;press reshaping occurs at temperatures in the 50&#8208;100 &#176;C range under a 3&#8208;ton pressure and does not significantly alter the material properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Studies for the Rational Design of Multivalent Glycodendrimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have synthesized B&#8208;antigen&#8208;displaying dendrimers (16&#8208;mers) with different sizes and evaluated their affinity to their IgM antibody in order to investigate which design features lead to effective multivalency. Unexpectedly, the smallest dendrimer, which cannot chelate the multiple binding sites of IgM, clearly exhibited multivalency, together with an affinity similar to or higher than those of the larger dendrimers. These results indicate that the statistical rebinding model, which involves the rapid exchange of clustered glycans, significantly contributes to the multivalency of glycodendrimers. Namely, in the design of glycodendrimers, high&#8208;density glycan presentation to enhance statistical rebinding should be considered in addition to the ability to chelate multiple binding sites. This notion stands in contrast to the currently prevailing scientific consensus, which prioritizes the chelation model. This study thus provides new and important guidelines for molecular design of glycodendrimers.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling the Emissive, Chiroptical, and Electrochemical Properties of Double [7]Helicenes through Embedded Aromatic Rings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present here the synthesis and in&#8208;depth physicochemical characterization of a double hetero[7]helicene fused with four triazole rings at both helical ends. The comparison of this triazole&#8208;fused double helicene with the previously reported all&#8208;carbon and thiadiazole&#8208;fused analogs revealed the huge impact of the embedded aromatic rings on the photophysical features. The small structural variation of the terminal rings from thiadiazole to triazole caused a dramatic change of the photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) from &lt;1% to 96%, while the replacement of the terminal benzene rings with triazole rings induced a tenfold enhancement of the circularly polarized luminescence dissymmetry factor. These observations were well corroborated with transient absorption analysis and/or theoretic calculations. In addition, the triazole&#8208;fused double helicene exhibited ambipolar redox behavior, enabling the generation of radical cation and anion species by electrochemical and chemical methods and showing its potential for spin&#8208;related applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Cage&#8208;Shaped Borates Bearing Pyrenylmethyl Groups: Efficient Lewis Acid Catalyst for Photoactivated Glycosylations Driven by Intramolecular Excimer Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the synthesis and characterization of a photoactivated boron&#8208;based Lewis acid catalyst based on a cage&#8208;shaped triphenolic ligand with three pyrenylmethyl moieties. The obtained cage&#8208;shaped borate functioned as a photoactivated Lewis acid catalyst thanks to the flexible three pyrenylmethyl moieties. The deformation of the cage&#8208;shaped scaffold driven by intramolecular excimer formations of the pyrenes is a critical factor in realizing the photoactivation. Mannich&#8208;type reactions and glycosylations significantly were accelerated under 370 nm light irradiations. It is noteworthy that various glycosyl fluorides, which are not easily activated in photocatalytic systems due to their high C&#8210;F bond stability, are activated by the photoimproved catalytic activity of the catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Two Paths to Oxidative C&#8722;H Amination Under Basic Conditions: A Theoretical Case Study Reveals Hidden Opportunities Provided by Electron Upconversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditionally, cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) leads to C&#8722;N bond formation under basic and oxidative conditions and is proposed to proceed via a two&#8208;electron bond formation mediated by carbenium ions. However, the formation of such high&#8208;energy intermediates is only possible in the presence of strong oxidants, which may lead to undesired side reactions and poor functional group tolerance. In this work, we explore if oxidation under basic conditions allows the formation of three&#8208;electron bonds (resulting in &#8220;upconverted&#8221; highly reducing radical&#8208;anions). The benefit of this &#8220;upconversion&#8221; process is in the ability to use milder oxidants (e.g., O  2  ) and to avoid high&#8208;energy intermediates. Comparison of the two&#8208; and three&#8208;electron pathways using quantum mechanical calculations reveals that not only does the absence of a strong oxidant shut down two&#8208;electron pathways in favor of a three&#8208;electron path but, paradoxically, weaker oxidants react faster with the upconverted reductants by avoiding the Marcus inverted region for electron transfer.</dc:description>

         <title>A Chemically Fuelled Molecular Automaton Displaying Programmed Migration of Zn2+ Between Alternative Binding Sites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A molecular system comprising a cationic zinc complex and an amino acid&#8208;derived ambident ligand having phosphate and carboxylate binding sites undergoes a series of rearrangements in which the metal cation migrates autonomously from one site to another. The location of the metal is identified by the circular dichroism spectrum of a ligated bis(2&#8208;quinolylmethyl)&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine (BQPA) chromophore, which takes a characteristic shape at each binding site. Migration is fuelled by the decomposition of trichloroacetic acid to CO2 and CHCl3 , which progressively neutralises the acidity of the system as a function of time, revealing in sequence binding sites of increasing basicity. The migration rate responds to control by variation of the temperature, water content and triethylamine concentration, while an excess of fuel controls the duration of an induction period before the migration event.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure of Zinc and Nickel Histidine Complexes in Solution Revealed by Molecular Dynamics and Raman Optical Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The histidine residue has an exceptional affinity for metals, but solution structure of its complexes are difficult to study. For zinc and nickel, we used Raman and Raman optical activity (ROA) spectroscopies to investigate the link between spectral shapes and the geometry. The spectra were measured and interpreted on the basis of ionic equilibria, molecular dynamics, ab initio molecular dynamics, and density functional theory. For zwitterionic histidine the dominant tautomer was determined by the decomposition of experimental spectra into calculated subspectra. An octahedral structure was found to prevail for the ZnHis  2  complex in solution, in contrast to a tetrahedral arrangement in the crystal phase. The solution geometry of NiHis  2  is more similar to the octahedral structure found by x&#8208;ray. The Raman and ROA structural determinations of metal complexes are dependent on extensive computations, but reveal unique information about the studied systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphorescence Induction by Host&#8208;Guest Complexation with Cyclodextrins &#8211; The Role of Regioisomerism and Affinity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8208;soluble aromatic thioethers reveal orange phosphorescence emission upon the formation of 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 inclusion complexes with &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin, which was proven by state of the art photophysical characterisations as well as ITC&#8208;, NMR&#8208; and fluorescence titration&#8208;measurements supported by molecular dynamics simulations. It was found that not only the binding affinity but also the orientation of the guest in and around the cavity is crucial to restrict motion able to induce the emission.







Abstract
We present an in&#8208;depth investigation of cyclodextrin complexes with guest compounds featuring complexation&#8208;induced room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in aqueous solution. Very interestingly, only the complexed regioisomers bearing lateral substituents on meta&#8208;position show RTP, whereas the stronger host&#8208;guest systems with para&#8208;substituted dyes show no RTP features. The reported systems were investigated regarding their complexation behavior in water using isothermal titration calorimetry and mass spectrometry. In the case of &#947;&#8208;CD very strong 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 inclusion complexes (Ka up to 5.13&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1) were unexpectedly observed. It was found that not only a strong binding to the cyclodextrin cavity is needed to restrict motion, inducing the emission, but also the conformation inside the cavity plays a pivotal role &#8211; as supported by an extensive NMR study and MD simulations.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Using A Molecular Antimony Complex under Aqueous Conditions: An Experimental and Computational Study on Main&#8208;Group Element Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An antimony complex was synthesized and heterogenized onto a carbon paper electrode surface. This system is capable of electrocatalytically evolving hydrogen gas under aqueous acidic conditions with high activity and efficiency. The stability of the heterogenized complex was confirmed by XPS of the used electrode surface and ICP&#8208;MS of the post catalysis electrolyte. Computational kinetic studies suggest that the generation of hydrogen&#8208;catalyst adduct is a rate&#8208;limiting step.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic hydrogen gas production is considered a potential pathway towards carbon&#8208;neutral energy sources. However, the development of this technology is hindered by the lack of efficient, cost&#8208;effective, and environmentally benign catalysts. In this study, a main&#8208;group&#8208;element&#8208;based electrocatalyst, SbSalen, is reported to catalyze the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in an aqueous medium. The heterogenized molecular system achieved a Faradaic efficiency of 100&#8201;% at &#8722;1.4&#8197;V vs. NHE with a maximum current density of &#8722;30.7&#8197;mA/cm2. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy of the catalyst&#8208;bound working electrode before and after electrolysis confirmed the molecular stability during catalysis. The turnover frequency was calculated as 43.4&#8197;s&#8722;1 using redox&#8208;peak integration. The kinetic and mechanistic aspects of the electrocatalytic reaction were further examined by computational methods. This study provides mechanistic insights into main&#8208;group&#8208;element electrocatalysts for heterogeneous small&#8208;molecule conversion.

         <title>CO2 Separation by Imide/Imine Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Select and separate: Two novel dicarboxyimide/imino&#8208;based organic cages are proposed as materials for the selective separation of CO2 from N2 and CH4 under vacuum swing adsorption conditions. Robust mixed&#8208;matrix membranes for gas separation were also obtained by loading the cages in either Matrimid&#174; or PEEK&#8208;WC as polymers. An improvement in the gas&#8208;transport properties is achieved compared to that of neat polymer membranes.







Abstract
Two novel imide/imine&#8208;based organic cages have been prepared and studied as materials for the selective separation of CO2 from N2 and CH4 under vacuum swing adsorption conditions. Gas adsorption on the new compounds showed selectivity for CO2 over N2 and CH4. The cages were also tested as fillers in mixed&#8208;matrix membranes for gas separation. Dense and robust membranes were obtained by loading the cages in either Matrimid&#174; or PEEK&#8208;WC polymers. Improved gas&#8208;transport properties and selectivity for CO2 were achieved compared to the neat polymer membranes.

         <title>Intramolecular, Interrupted Homo&#8208;Nazarov Cascade Biscyclizations to Angular (Hetero)Aryl&#8208;Fused Polycycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkenyl cyclopropyl ketones tethered to (hetero)arenes readily underwent catalytic, intramolecular interrupted homo&#8208;Nazarov cascade biscyclizations to form 6,6,6&#8208;, 6,5,6&#8208;, 6,6,5&#8208;, 6,6,6,5&#8208;, and 6,6,5,6&#8208;fused angular architectures. The approach was used for the concise total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;1&#8208;oxoferruginol, a bioactive abietane diterpenoid.







Abstract
Herein, a SnCl4&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular, interrupted homo&#8208;Nazarov cascade biscyclization to access angular (hetero)aryl&#8208;fused polycycles is reported. Subsequent decarboxylation of the readily enolizable products afforded the angular products in up to 71&#8201;% yield over two steps, with the trans&#8208;diastereomers as the major products. The cyclopropyl homo&#8208;Nazarov cyclization precursors were formed using a scalable and modular synthetic route that, ultimately, offers access to 6,6,6&#8208;, 6,6,5&#8208;, 6,5,6&#8208;, 6,6,5,6&#8208;, and 6,6,6,5&#8208;fused angular polycyclic products. To showcase the rigor and utility of the method, an 8&#8208;step total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;1&#8208;oxoferruginol, an antibacterial aromatic abietane diterpenoid, was disclosed.

         <title>Atmospheric&#8208;Temperature Chain Reaction towards Ultrathin Non&#8208;Crystal&#8208;Phase Construction for Highly Efficient Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multistep chain reaction at atmospheric temperature restructures the surface of high&#8208;crystallinity cobalt carbonate hydroxides (CCHs). An ultrathin (&#8764;5&#8197;nm) lattice&#8208;disorder layer of Fe(OH)3 on the CCH appeared to form CCH&#8722;FeOH hetero&#8208;interfaces, which are of great benefit for nano&#8208;interface exposure. The microscopic surface morphology of the material (CCH&#8722;FeOH&#8208;Dx) can be controlled by adjusting the degree of chain reaction. The as&#8208;obtained CCH&#8722;FeOH with an ultrathin shell structure is conducive to mass transfer and ion migration, giving excellent HER/OER performance.







Abstract
Combining the self&#8208;sacrifice of a highly crystalline substance to design a multistep chain reaction towards ultrathin active&#8208;layer construction for high&#8208;performance water splitting with atmospheric&#8208;temperature conditions and an environmentally benign aqueous environment is extremely intriguing and full of challenges. Here, taking cobalt carbonate hydroxides (CCHs) as the initial crystalline material, we choose the Lewis acid metal salt of Fe(NO3)3 to induce an aqueous&#8208;phase chain reaction generating free CO32&#8722; ions with subsequent instant FeCO3 hydrolysis. The resultant ultrathin (&#8764;5&#8197;nm) amorphous Fe&#8208;based hydroxide layer on CCH results in considerable activity in catalyzing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), yielding 10/50&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at overpotentials of 230/266.5&#8197;mV for OER and 72.5/197.5&#8197;mV for HER. The catalysts can operate constantly in 1.0&#8197;M KOH over 48 and 45&#8197;h for the OER and HER, respectively. For bifunctional catalysis for alkaline electrolyzer assembly, a cell voltage as low as 1.53&#8197;V was necessary to yield 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (1.7&#8197;V at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). This work rationally builds high&#8208;efficiency electrochemical bifunctional water&#8208;splitting catalysts and offers a trial in establishing a controllable nanolevel ultrathin lattice disorder layer through an atmospheric&#8208;temperature chemical route.

Here, taking cobalt carbonate hydroxides (CCHs) as the initial crystalline material, we choose the Lewis acid metal salt of Fe(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to induce an aqueous-phase chain reaction generating free CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ions with subsequent instant FeCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; hydrolysis. The resultant ultrathin (&#8764;5&#8197;nm) amorphous Fe-based hydroxide layer on CCH results in considerable activity in catalyzing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), yielding 10/50&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at overpotentials of 230/266.5&#8197;mV for OER and 72.5/197.5&#8197;mV for HER. The catalysts can operate constantly in 1.0&#8197;M KOH over 48 and 45&#8197;h for the OER and HER, respectively. For bifunctional catalysis for alkaline electrolyzer assembly, a cell voltage as low as 1.53&#8197;V was necessary to yield 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (1.7&#8197;V at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). This work rationally builds high-efficiency electrochemical bifunctional water-splitting catalysts and offers a trial in establishing a controllable nanolevel ultrathin lattice disorder layer through an atmospheric-temperature chemical route.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Mediated Directional Capping of Rod&#8208;Packing Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on structural analysis of newly synthesized 3D rod&#8208;packing manganese&#8208;based framework, strategic design of capping agent was developed to obtain a 2D rod&#8208;packing framework. SQUID measurements and DFT calculations proved ferrimagnetic ordering of the material below 8&#8197;K, further illustrating the potential of developing spintronic materials through 2D rod&#8208;packing MOFs







Abstract
Two new rod&#8208;packing metal&#8211;organic frameworks (RPMOF) are constructed by regulating the in situ formation of the capping agent. In CPM&#8208;s7, carboxylate linkers extend 1D manganese&#8208;oxide chains in four additional directions, forming 3D RPMOF. The substitution of Mn2+ with a stronger Lewis acidic Co2+, leads to an acceleration of the hydrolysis&#8208;prone sulfonate linker, resulting in presence of sulfate ions to reduce two out of the four carboxylate&#8208;extending directions, and thus forming a new 2D rod&#8208;packing CPM&#8208;s8. Density functional theory calculations and magnetization measurements reveal ferrimagnetic ordering of CPM&#8208;s8, signifying the potential of exploring 2D RPMOF for effective low&#8208;dimensional magnetic materials.

         <title>An Introduction to the Combustion of Carbon Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Looking back over centuries of research on carbon combustion, this reaction has literally fuelled the development of mankind and truly astonishing technological advancement. Carbon combustion is complex and interplay of different limitations such as diffusion, heat/mass transfer, and reactivity of active sites is observed. The understanding and a unifying concept of carbon combustion may prove to be valuable also for the understanding of novel carbon nanomaterials, such as fibres or graphene like materials.







Abstract
Combustion is arguably as old as homo sapiens ability to observe and use fire. Despite the long tradition of using carbon combustion for energy production, this reaction is still not fully understood. This can be related to several facts that are intertwined and complicate the investigation, such as the large variety of possible carbon structures, the actual surface structure, porosity, the solid&#8208;gas nature of this reaction, diffusion limitation and fundamental reaction steps. In this review, a brief history of carbon combustion science is given, followed by a detailed discussion of the most important aspects of carbon combustion. Special attention is given to limitations for example diffusion. In carbon combustion, kinetic control can rarely be observed. The literature of the fundamental reaction steps actually occurring on the carbon framework is reviewed and it becomes apparent that the reaction is occurring primarily on defects on the basal plane. Thus, the reaction between oxygen and carbon may be used as an analytical tool to provide further insights into novel materials, for example synthetic carbon materials, fibres and graphene type materials. Mastering the combustion reaction in all its complexity may prove to be very valuable in the future.

         <title>Coassembly of Chiral Amines and a Four&#8208;Armed Cyano&#8208;Substituted Luminophore through Hydrogen bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality transfer from chiral molecules to assemblies is of vital importance to the design of functional chiral materials. In this work, we report the selective co&#8208;assembly behaviors between chiral molecules and an achiral luminophore, potentially driven by the intermolecular salt&#8208;bridge type hydrogen bonds. Cyano&#8208;substituted tetrakis(arylthio)benzene carboxylic acid (  TA  ) served as the luminophore and hydrogen bond donors, which underwent co&#8208;assembly with different chiral amines. It was found that structures of chiral amines affect the chirality transfer and the properties of coassemblies due to effects on hydrogen bonds and stacking pattern. Only in specific co&#8208;assemblies, the chiroptical properties occurred at both ground state and excited states based on the emerged Cotton effects and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) signals, revealing the chirality successfully transferred from molecular level to supramolecular level. In addition, accurate quantitative examination of chiral amines was realized by circular dichroism (CD) spectra. This work demonstrates the characteristic chirality response and transfer  via  co&#8208;assembly, providing a potential method to develop smart chiroptical materials.</dc:description>

         <title>An encapsulated neutral ruthenium catalyst for substrateselective oxidation of alcohols</title>

The formation of an inclusion complex was inferred from a combination of spectral measurements (MS, UVvisible spectroscopy, 1 H and DOSY NMR). The 31 P and 19 F NMR spectra are consistent with motions of the ruthenium complex inside the self&#8208;assembled capsule. Molecular dynamics simulations carried out on the inclusion complex confirmed these intra&#8208;cavity movements and highlighted possible supramolecular interactions between the ruthenium first coordination sphere ligands and the inner&#8208;part (aromatic rings) of the capsule. The embedded ruthenium complex was assessed in the catalytic oxidation (using NaIO 4 as oxidant) of mixtures of three arylmethyl alcohols into the corresponding aldehydes. The reaction kinetics were shown to vary as a function of the substrates' size, with the oxidation rate varying in the order benzylalcohol &gt; 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;benzylalcohol &gt; 9&#8208;anthracenemethanol. Control experiments realized in the absence of hexameric capsule did not allow any discrimination between the substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Calibrating Catalytic DNA Nanostructures for Site&#8208;Selective Protein Modification
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three protein&#8208;DNA conjugates were designed to calibrate the protein modification abilities of catalyst&#8208;functionalized DNA. For two catalysts, a clear correlation between distance and efficiency was found and both linker between DNA and protein as well as position and type of catalyst influenced the site of modification. Computational simulations were used to corroborate the findings.







Abstract
Many biomedical fields rely on proteins that are selectively modified. These can be attached using reactive or catalytic moieties, but the position where these moieties are attached is often poorly controlled. We assessed how catalyst position affects the efficiency and selectivity of protein modification. For this, we anchored a template DNA strand to three different proteins, which were subsequently hybridized to DNA strands that contained catalysts at different positions. We found a strong correlation between the catalyst&#8208;to&#8208;protein distance and the efficiency of protein modification for acyl transfer catalysts, which operate via a covalently bound reactant intermediate. Additionally, we found that the catalyst's distance and orientation with respect to the protein surface, also influences its site&#8208;selectivity. A catalyst operating with unbound reactant intermediates showed only enhanced efficiency. Our results are rationalized using computational simulations, showing that one&#8208;point anchoring of the DNA construct leads to notable differences in the site of modification.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Induced Structural Change in Artificial Heterometallic&#8208;Oxide Cluster Mimicking the Photosynthetic Oxygen&#8208;Evolving Center</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To understand the chemical principle of the photosynthetic oxygen&#8208;evolving center (OEC), we report two (Mn3XO4)2O&#8208;clusters (X=Sr2+, La3+) closely mimicking both the heterometallic&#8208;oxide cubane and all types of oxide bridges in OEC. Structural comparison of both oxidized and reduced forms of the (Mn3LaO4)2O&#8208;cluster indicates that the reactive site is the &#956;2&#8208;oxide bridge rather than the &#956;4&#8208;oxide or &#956;3&#8208;oxide bridges in the cluster.







Abstract
The oxygen&#8208;evolving center (OEC) in photosynthesis is a unique Mn4CaO5&#8208;cluster that catalyzes the water&#8208;splitting reaction in nature. Understanding its catalytic mechanism for the O=O bond formation is of great challenge and long&#8208;standing issue, which is severely restricted by the lack of precise structure and mechanism mimics of this heterometallic&#8208;oxide cluster. Herein, we report two synthetic (Mn3XO4)2O&#8208;clusters (X=Sr2+, La3+) that closely mimic the heterometallic&#8208;oxide Mn3XO4 cubane and three different types of &#956;&#8208;oxide bridges (&#956;2&#8208;O2&#8722;, &#956;3&#8208;O2&#8722;, and &#956;4&#8208;O2&#8722;) simultaneously as seen in the OEC. By resolving the crystal structures of both oxidized and reduced forms of the cluster, we have identified significant redox&#8208;induced structural changes that take place on the &#956;2&#8208;oxide bridge, rather than the &#956;4&#8208;oxide or &#956;3&#8208;oxide bridges. Our results provide chemical insights into understanding the reactivity of three different types of oxide bridges in the biological Mn4CaO5&#8208;cluster in PSII.

         <title>Muon Spin Rotation/Resonance (&#956;SR) for Studying Radical Reactivity of Unsaturated Organophosphorus Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The positive muon (&#956;+) can be regarded as a light isotope of proton and has been useful for study of radical reactions of organic compounds through formation of muonium (Mu=[&#956;+e&#8211;]). This article overviews the Muon Spin Rotation/Resonance (&#956;SR) studies of the phosphorus congeners of alkenes, anthracenes, and cyclobutane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyls. The hydrogen surrogate enabled characterization of the regioselective radical additions producing the particular paramagnetic organophosphorus molecules.







Abstract
The positive muon (&#956;+) can be regarded as a light isotope of proton and has been an important tool to study radical reactions of organic compounds. Recently, muons have been applied to produce short&#8208;lived paramagnetic species from the heavier unsaturated organic molecules including the p&#8208;block elements. This article overviews recent muon spin rotation/resonance (&#956;SR) studies on the phosphorus analogs of alkenes, anthracenes, and cyclobutane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyls together with the fundamentals of &#956;SR. The acyclic phosphaalkene of P=C and phosphasilenes of P=Si can accept muonium (Mu=[&#956;+e&#8722;]) at the heavier double bonds, and the corresponding radicals have been characterized. The phosphorus atom in 9&#8208;phosphaanthracene, whose P=C double bond is stabilized by the peri&#8208;substituted CF3 groups, predominantly captures muonium to provide the corresponding paramagnetic fused heterocyclic system. The peri&#8208;trifluoromethyl groups are functional to promote the unprecedented light isotope effect of muon providing the planar three&#8208;cyclic molecular structure to consume the increased zero&#8208;point energy. The formally open&#8208;shell singlet 1,3&#8208;diphosphacyclobutane&#8208;2,4&#8208;diyl unit can accept muonium at the (ylidic) phosphorus or the skeletal radicalic carbon, and the corresponding paramagnetic phosphorus heterocycles can be characterized by &#956;SR. The findings on these muoniation processes to the unsaturated phosphorus&#8208;containing compounds will contribute not only to development of novel paramagnetic functional species but also to progress on muon science.

         <title>Suppression of Liquid&#8211;Liquid Phase Separation and Aggregation of Antibodies by Modest Pressure Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high colloidal stability is important for pharmaceutical applications of antibody solutions. We demonstrate a high pressure sensitivity of antibody condensates as a suitable means to suppress liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation and subsequent aggregation of concentrated antibody solutions. The immunoglobulin molecules themselves are highly pressure resistant against unfolding, however, and can sustain high pressures without changing conformation. More information can be found in the Research Article by R. Winter and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201658).

How to activate a Re&#8722;CO bond: Carbon monoxide&#8208;releasing molecules (CORMs) have attracted significant attention because of the vasorelaxation effect of CO. When a phthalocyanine ligand was used, the Re&#8722;CO bonds were successfully activated by a low&#8208;energy photon of red light, which can penetrate deeply into living tissues. Thus, this study provides key insights and a foundation for designing photoCORMs for biological or therapeutic applications. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Kato, K.

         <title>Surface Engineering of Conjugated Polybenzothiadiazoles and Integration with Cobalt Oxides for Photocatalytic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conjugated polybenzothiadiazoles thermally treated by a hydrolysis process present high hydrophilicity and low water absorption energy, which enable excellent photocatalytic water oxidation performance and stability.







Abstract
Conjugated polymers feature promising structure and properties for photocatalytic water splitting. Herein, a hydrolysis strategy was demonstrated to rationally modulate the surface hydrophilicity and band structures of conjugated poly&#8208;benzothiadiazoles. High hydrophilicity not only enhances the dispersions of polymeric solids in an aqueous solution but also reduces the absorption energy of water molecules. Besides, both theoretical and experimental results reveal that a more positive valence band potential is generated, which contributes to enhancing the photocatalytic water oxidation performance.

     alt="Surface Engineering of Conjugated Polybenzothiadiazoles and Integration with Cobalt Oxides for Photocatalytic Water Oxidation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conjugated polybenzothiadiazoles&lt;/b&gt; thermally treated by a hydrolysis process present high hydrophilicity and low water absorption energy, which enable excellent photocatalytic water oxidation performance and stability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conjugated polymers feature promising structure and properties for photocatalytic water splitting. Herein, a hydrolysis strategy was demonstrated to rationally modulate the surface hydrophilicity and band structures of conjugated poly-benzothiadiazoles. High hydrophilicity not only enhances the dispersions of polymeric solids in an aqueous solution but also reduces the absorption energy of water molecules. Besides, both theoretical and experimental results reveal that a more positive valence band potential is generated, which contributes to enhancing the photocatalytic water oxidation performance. Accordingly, the surface-modified conjugated polymers show largely promoted photocatalytic water oxidation activities by deposition of cobalt oxides as cocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dissecting Noncovalent Interactions in Carboxyl&#8208;Functionalized Ionic Liquids Exhibiting Double and Single Hydrogens Bonds Between Ions of Like Charge</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Like&#8208;charge attraction is observed for carboxyl&#8208;functionalized ionic liquids. In the solid state, doubly hydrogen&#8208;bonded cationic dimers dominate. In the liquid, these structural motifs are replaced by single hydrogen bonds between like&#8208; and oppositely charged ions. Combining X&#8208;ray crystallography, IR spectroscopy, thermodynamic methods and DFT calculations allows all types of hydrogen bonding in the solid, liquid and gaseous states of the ionic liquid to be analyzed and characterized. More information can be found in the Research Article by R. Ludwig and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200949).

Dwarfs are shown fixing two rhodium atoms into the skeleton of 21,23&#8208;dirhodaporphyrin, the first [18]porphyrin to incorporate two metal atoms within its macrocyclic frame, in place of two core nitrogen donors. The 18&#8208;&#960;&#8208;electron aromatic circuit is maintained, playing a crucial role in stabilizing the macrocycle, and enforcing the metal centers&#8242; proximity. These small metal sculptures of dwarfs are a tourist attraction scattered around Wroc&#322;aw, the city in Poland where the dirhodaporphyrin was synthesized.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mechanism of oxy&#8208;arylation/vinylation of alkenes catalyzed by the (MeDalphos)AuCl complex  was comprehensively investigated by DFT. (P,N)Au(Ph)  2+  and (P,N)Au(vinyl)  2+  are key intermediates accounting for the activation of the alkenols and for their cyclization by outer&#8208;sphere nucleophilic attack of oxygen. The 5&#8208;  exo  and 6&#8208;  endo  paths have been computed and compared, reproducing the peculiar regioselectivity difference observed experimentally between  4&#8208;penten&#8208;1&#8208;ol, (  E  ) and (  Z  )&#8208;4&#8208;hexen&#8208;1&#8208;ols.

         <dc:description>The synthesis and characterization of laterally extended azabora[5]&#8208;, &#8208;[6]&#8208; and &#8208;[7]helicenes, assembled from  N  &#8208;heteroaromatic and dibenzo[  g  ,  p  ]chrysene building blocks is described. Formally, the &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems of the pristine azaborole helicenes were enlarged with a phenanthrene unit leading to compounds with large Stokes shifts, significantly enhanced luminescence quantum yields (&#1060;) and dissymmetry factors (  g  lum  ). The beneficial effect on optical properties was also observed for helical elongation. The combined contributions of lateral and helical extensions resulted in a compound showing green emission with F of 0.31 and |  g  lum  | of 2.2&#160;&#215;&#160;10  &#8209;3  , highest within the series of &#960;&#8208;extended azaborahelicenes and superior to emission intensity and chiroptical response of its non&#8208;extended congener. This study shows that helical and lateral extensions of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems are viable strategies to improve features of azaborole helicenes. In addition, single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis of configurationally stable [6]&#8208; and &#8208;[7]helicenes was used to provide insight into their packing arrangements.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular design of silicon&#8208;containing diazenes: absorbance of E and Z isomers in near&#8208;infrared region</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a Fukuyama&#8208;type coupling of thioesters with aliphatic organomanganese reagents utilizing a cheap and easily available iron(III) precatalyst. The reactions exhibit a wide tolerance of solvents and functional groups, allowing for the conversion of thioesters derived from natural products and pharmaceutical compounds. A strong steric impact from each reaction component (carboxylic moiety, thiol substituent and manganese reagent) was displayed, which enabled regioselective transformation of dithioesters. Mechanistic investigations showed that the released thiolate does not act as a mere spectator ligand, but rather positively influences the stability of intermediate alkyl(II)ferrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Photo&#8208;Responsive Pd2L4 Type Nanocage based on Feringa&#8217;s Second&#8208;Generation Motor and Its Guest Binding Ability for C60</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present the construction of a M  2  L  4  type metal&#8208;organic nanocage featuring four endohedral Feringa&#8217;s motor motifs and its adaptive encapsulation towards C  60  guest molecule. The structure of the cage, though complicated on the  1  H NMR spectrum due to the adoption of mixed ligands, was unambiguously characterized with a combination of ESI&#8208;MS, 2D DOSY,  13  C NMR and particularly the SAXS technique. The molecular motor within the cage demonstrated similar photophysical properties to the uncoordinated one, indicating the motor&#8217;s function was not compromised when it was anchored in such a confined nanospace. Furthermore, the nanocage showed good guest encapsulation ability towards C  60  , and a guest induced&#8208;fit behavior of the cage was revealed based on the extensive SAXS analysis and molecular dynamics simulation. The adaptive motorized nanocage reported here represents one of the very few examples of integrating individual motors into a discrete nanoconfined system and offers prospects to achieve its non&#8208;equilibrium functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery of Complex Binding and Reaction Mechanisms from Ternary Gases in Rare Earth Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the selectivity of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) to complex acid gas streams will enable their use in industrial applications. Herein, ab initio molecular dynamic simulations (AIMD) were used to simulate ternary gas mixtures (H  2  O&#8208;NO  2  &#8208;SO  2  )&#160;in rare earth 2,5&#8208;dihydroxyterephthalic acid (RE&#8208;DOBDC) MOFs. Stronger H  2  O gas&#8208;metal binding arose from thermal vibrations in the MOF sterically hindering access of SO  2  and NO  2  molecules to the metal sites. Gas&#8208;gas and gas&#8208;linker interactions within the MOF framework resulted in the formation of multiple secondary gas species including HONO, HNO  2  , NOSO, and HNO  3  &#8208;  . Four gas adsorption sites were identified along with a new de&#8208;protonation reaction mechanism not observable through experiment. This study not only provides valuable information on competitive gas binding energies in the MOF, it also provides important chemical insights into transient chemical reactions and mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic E&#8594;Z Contra&#8208;Thermodynamic Isomerization of Vinyl Silanes with Lewis Base</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The contra&#8208;thermodynamic E&#8594;Z isomerization of vinyl silanes was reported using rac&#8208;BINAP as the photocatalyst. This reaction proceeds via the in situ formation of a chromophoric species, in the presence of catalyst. Under irradiation at 405&#8197;nm the interconversion of E&#8208;isomers into the Z&#8208;congeners were carried out in good to excellent yields and outstanding Z/E selectivities (18 examples) and the reaction mechanism was studied.







Abstract
Herein, we disclosed the contra&#8208;thermodynamic E&#8594;Z isomerization of alkenyl silanes, according to the in situ formation of a chromophoric species, in the presence of rac&#8208;BINAP as the catalyst. The reaction carried out in DMSO or CH3CN under irradiation at 405&#8197;nm allowed the interconversion of the E&#8208;isomers into the Z&#8208;congeners in good to excellent yields and outstanding Z/E selectivities, on 18 examples. Finally, the mechanism of this E&#8594;Z isomerization was studied to get insight into the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Selective Iron Catalyzed Synthesis of N&#8208;Alkylated Indolines and Indoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In contrast to classical iron&#8208;catalyzed C3&#8208;alkylations of indoles via the borrowing&#8208;hydrogen methodology, this contribution describes the switch of the selectivity towards N&#8208;alkylation. Starting from indolines, N&#8208;alkylation was efficiently done using a tricarbonyl(cyclopentadienone) iron complex as the catalyst in 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethanol. Notably, performing the one pot N&#8208;alkylation of indolines, followed by oxidation using a FeBr3/TEMPO catalyst with t&#8208;BuOOH, the corresponding N&#8208;alkylated indoles were obtained.







Abstract
Whereas iron catalysts usually promote catalyzed C3&#8208;alkylation of indole derivatives via a borrowing&#8208;hydrogen methodology using alcohols as the electrophilic partners, this contribution shows how to switch the selectivity towards N&#8208;alkylation. Thus, starting from indoline derivatives, N&#8208;alkylation was efficiently performed using a tricarbonyl(cyclopentadienone) iron complex as the catalyst in trifluoroethanol in the presence of alcohols leading to the corresponding N&#8208;alkylated indoline derivatives in 31&#8211;99&#8201;% yields (28&#8197;examples). The one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step strategy for the selective N&#8208;alkylation of indolines is completed by an oxidation to give the corresponding N&#8208;alkylated indoles in 31&#8211;90&#8201;% yields (15&#8197;examples). This unprecedented oxidation methodology involves an iron salt catalyst associated with (2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)oxyl (TEMPO) and a stoichiometric amount of t&#8208;BuOOH at room temperature.

         <title>Switching Chirophilic Self&#8208;assembly: From meso&#8208;structures to Conglomerates in Liquid and Liquid Crystalline Network Phases of Achiral Polycatenar Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spontaneous generation of chirality from achiral molecules is a contemporary research topic with numerous implications for technological applications and for the understanding of the development of homogeneous chirality in biosystems. Herein, a series of azobenzene based rod&#8208;like molecules with an 3,4,5&#8208;trialkylated end and a single  n&#8208;  alkyl chain involving 5 to 20 aliphatic carbons at the opposite end is reported. Depending on the chain length and temperature these achiral molecules self&#8208;assemble into a series of liquid and liquid crystalline (LC) helical network phases. A chiral isotropic liquid (Iso  1  [  *  ]  ) and a cubic triple network phase with chiral  I  23 lattice were found for the short chain compounds, whereas non&#8208;cubic and achiral cubic phases dominate for the long chain compounds. Among them a mesoscale conglomerate with  I  23 lattice, a tetragonal phase (Tet  bi  ) containing one chirality synchronized and one non&#8208;synchronized achiral network, an achiral double network  meso&#8208;  structure with  Ia  d  space group and an achiral percolated isotropic liquid mesophase (Iso  1  ) were found. This sequence is attributed to an increasing strength of chirality synchronization between the networks, combined with a change of the preferred mode of chirophilic self&#8208;assembly between the networks, switching from enantiophilic to enantiophobic with decreasing chain length and lowering temperature. These nanostructured and mirror symmetry broken LC phases exist over wide temperature ranges which is of interest for potential applications in chiral and photosensitive functional materials derived from achiral compounds.</dc:description>

The reactivity of&#160;aryl monocarboxylic acids (benzoic, 1&#8208; or 2&#8208;naphtoic, 4&#8217;&#8208;methylbiphenyl&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylic and anthracene&#8208;9&#8208;carboxylic acids) has been investigated as complexing agent toward the ethoxide niobium(V) (Nb(OEt)  5  precursor. A total of 8 coordination complexes has been isolated with distinct niobium(V) nuclearities as well as carboxylates complexation states. The use of benzoic acid gives to a tetranuclear core Nb  4  (&#956;  2  &#8208;O)  4  (  L  )  4  (OEt)  8  ] (  L  = benzoate (  1  )) exhibiting four Nb&#8208;(&#956;  2  &#8208;O)&#8208;Nb linkages in a square plane configuration. A similar tetramer (  7  ) is obtained with 2&#8208;naphtoic acid by using a 55% humidity atmosphere synthetic route. Two types of dinuclear bricks has been identified with one central Nb&#8208;(&#956;  2  &#8208;O)&#8208;Nb linkages, and differ by the complexation state, with one bridging carboxylate ([Nb  2  (&#956;  2  &#8208;O)(&#956;  2  &#8208;OEt)(  L  )(OEt)  6  ], with  L  = 1&#8208;naphtoate (  3)  &amp;  L  = anthracene&#8208;9&#8208;carboxylate (  5  )) or two bridging carboxylate groups ([Nb  2  (&#956;  2  &#8208;O)(  L  )  2  (OEt)  6  ], with  L  = 4&#8217;&#8208;methylbiphenyl&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylic (  4)  &amp;  L  = anthracene&#8208;9&#8208;carboxylate (  6  )).

         <title>[2+3] Amide Cages by Oxidation of [2+3] Imine Cages &#8211; Revisiting Molecular Hosts for Highly Efficient Nitrate Binding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of second generation amide cages were synthesized in high yields by converting imine cages by Pinnick oxidation reactions. By NMR titration experiments, one amide cage was identified having superior selectivities of nitrate vs. chloride (S=705) or hydrogensulfate (S &gt;13400) in combination with high association constants for nitrate.







Abstract
The pollution of groundwater with nitrate is a serious issue because nitrate can cause several diseases such as methemoglobinemia or cancer. Therefore, selective removal of nitrate by efficient binding to supramolecular hosts is highly desired. Here we describe how to make [2+3] amide cages in very high to quantitative yields by applying an optimized Pinnick oxidation protocol for the conversion of corresponding imine cages. By NMR titration experiments of the eight different [2+3] amide cages with nitrate, chloride and hydrogen sulfate we identified one cage with an unprecedented high selectivity towards nitrate binding vs. chloride (S=705) or hydrogensulfate (S&gt;13500) in CD2Cl2/CD3CN (1&#8201;:&#8201;3). NMR experiments as well as single&#8208;crystal structure comparison of host&#8208;guest complexes give insight into structure&#8208;property&#8208;relationships.

         <title>A Happy Get&#8208;Together &#8211; Probing Electrochemical Interfaces by Non&#8208;Linear Vibrational Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review aims at exploring the developments in understanding the molecular process at electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface facilitated by the collaboration between Vibrational Sum&#8208;Frequency Generation Spectroscopy (VSFG) and electrochemistry. Methodological advancements for incorporating VSFG in electrochemical set&#8208;ups to probe transient species during electrocatalytic reactions and solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase formation in the battery are assessed.







Abstract
Electrochemical interfaces are key structures in energy storage and catalysis. Hence, a molecular understanding of the active sites at these interfaces, their solvation, the structure of adsorbates, and the formation of solid&#8208;electrolyte interfaces are crucial for an in&#8208;depth mechanistic understanding of their function. Vibrational sum&#8208;frequency generation (VSFG) spectroscopy has emerged as an operando spectroscopic technique to monitor complex electrochemical interfaces due to its intrinsic interface sensitivity and chemical specificity. Thus, this review discusses the happy get&#8208;together between VSFG spectroscopy and electrochemical interfaces. Methodological approaches for answering core issues associated with the behavior of adsorbates on electrodes, the structure of solvent adlayers, the transient formation of reaction intermediates, and the emergence of solid electrolyte interphase in battery research are assessed to provide a critical inventory of highly promising avenues to bring optical spectroscopy to use in modern material research in energy conversion and storage.

Methodological advancements for incorporating VSFG in electrochemical set-ups to probe transient species during electrocatalytic reactions and solid-electrolyte interphase formation in the battery are assessed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical interfaces are key structures in energy storage and catalysis. Hence, a molecular understanding of the active sites at these interfaces, their solvation, the structure of adsorbates, and the formation of solid-electrolyte interfaces are crucial for an in-depth mechanistic understanding of their function. Vibrational sum-frequency generation (VSFG) spectroscopy has emerged as an operando spectroscopic technique to monitor complex electrochemical interfaces due to its intrinsic interface sensitivity and chemical specificity. Thus, this review discusses the happy get-together between VSFG spectroscopy and electrochemical interfaces. Methodological approaches for answering core issues associated with the behavior of adsorbates on electrodes, the structure of solvent adlayers, the transient formation of reaction intermediates, and the emergence of solid electrolyte interphase in battery research are assessed to provide a critical inventory of highly promising avenues to bring optical spectroscopy to use in modern material research in energy conversion and storage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Platform for Novel Reaction Discovery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extract, isolate and discover: We have designed a simple technique that can rapidly isolate reaction products with excellent purity by solid&#8208;phase extraction. This unique technique enabled us to develop a high&#8208;throughput reaction discovery platform. The effectiveness of this strategy was demonstrated by one newly discovered transformation, which shed light on the laboratory&#8208;scale discovery of new reactions.







Abstract
Detecting the formation of new chemical bonds in high&#8208;throughput synthesis is limited by the efficiency and scalability of reaction product detection, as conventional methods for isolating product from reaction mixtures are time consuming and labor intensive. Here, we report a miniaturizable purification method that enables the rapid, high&#8208;throughput isolation of quaternary ammonium&#8208;tagged products from reaction mixtures with excellent purity using inexpensive equipment that easily can be set up in a typical organic chemistry laboratory. This novel purification technique enabled us to establish a high&#8208;throughput reaction discovery platform. We validated this platform in a screen of 1536 reactions, and one previously unreported transformation was identified.

         <title>Facet Engineering on WO3 Mono&#8208;Particle&#8208;Layer Electrode for Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Facet&#8208;aligned WO3 photoelectrodes: An electrode with planar configuration of massively assembled WO3 plates exposes (002) facets to the electrolyte so that bulk hole diffusion and interfacial charge transfer are facilitated. Photo&#8208;deposited Au at electron enriched {110} edges is positioned at the bottom to further improve charge collection to the substrate.







Abstract
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance of WO3 photoanodes for water splitting is heavily influenced by the orientation of crystal facets. In this work, mono&#8208;particle&#8208;layer electrodes, assembled by particulate WO3 square plates with highly uniform alignment along the (002) facet, improved PEC water oxidation kinetics and stability. Photo&#8208;deposition of Au along the cracks formed on the surface of the plates, which are the edges of {110} facets, was found to further enhance electron collection efficiency. Combination of these two strategies allowed the facet&#8208;engineered WO3 electrode to produce significantly higher efficiencies in charge separation and transfer than the electrode prepared without facet orientation. This work has provided a facile route for fabricating a structurally designed WO3 photoelectrode, which is also applicable to other regularly shaped semiconductor photocatalysts with anisotropic charge migration.

         <title>Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification of a Porous Hydrocarbon Cage to Give a Discrete Co24 Organometallic Complex
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust porous cage was synthesized using irreversible alkyne coupling reactions. Reaction with dicobalt octacarbonyl gave exhaustive metalation of the 12 alkyne units to give the Co24(CO)72 adduct of the cage in a single pot.







Abstract
A new alkyne&#8208;based hydrocarbon cage was synthesized in high overall yield using alkyne&#8208;alkyne coupling in the cage forming step. The cage is porous and displays a moderately high BET surface area (546&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1). The cage loses crystallinity on activation and thus is porous in its amorphous form, while very similar cages have been either non&#8208;porous, or retained crystallinity on activation. Reaction of the cage with Co2(CO)8 results in exhaustive metalation of its 12 alkyne groups to give the Co24(CO)72 adduct of the cage in good yield.

         <title>Monomeric Magnesium Catalyzed Alkene and Alkyne Hydroboration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, two monomeric magnesium alkyl complexes (  1  and  2  ) were prepared using bis(phosphino)carbazole framework and among them  1  has been used as a catalyst for hydroboration of alkenes and alkynes with pinacolborane (HBpin). A broad variety of aromatic and aliphatic alkenes and alkynes were efficiently reduced. Anti&#8208;Markovnikov regioselective hydroboration of alkenes and alkynes was achieved, which was confirmed by deuterium&#8208;labelling experiments. The work represents the first example of the use of magnesium in homogeneous catalytic hydroboration of alkene with broad substrate scope. Experimental mechanistic investigations and DFT calculations provided insights into the reaction mechanism. Finally, the hydroboration protocol was extended to terpenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Metalloenzyme&#8208;mediated thiol&#8208;yne addition towards photoisomerizable fluorescent dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proteins are able to irreversibly assemble biologically active ligands from building blocks bearing complementary reactive functions due their spatial proximity, through a kinetic target&#8208;guided synthetic process (also named in situ click chemistry). Although linkages thus formed are mostly passive, some of them have shown to significantly contribute to the protein binding through for instance hydrogen bonding and stacking interactions. Biocompatible reactions and click chemistry are a formidable source of inspiration for developing such new protein&#8208;directed ligations. In this study, we report a proximity&#8208;induced thiol&#8208;yne synthesis of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Not only this example widens the arsenal of Kinetic target&#8208;guided synthesis (KTGS) eligible reactions, but the obtained product displayed unsuspected photophysical properties. The corresponding vinyl sulfide linkage conjugated to a coumarin core proved to be engaged in a monodirectional Z to E photoisomerization process. Further investigations guided by theoretical calculations showed that fine&#8208;tuning of the nature of the substituents on the coumarin moiety allows to obtain a bidirectional photochemical process, thus discovering a new photoswitching moiety, displaying moreover fluorescence properties. Due to the spectral tunability of coumarin derivatives, this work should open new opportunities for the design of vinyl sulfide&#8208;based photoswitch systems with modular photophysical properties.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Proteins are able to irreversibly assemble biologically active ligands from building blocks bearing complementary reactive functions due their spatial proximity, through a kinetic target-guided synthetic process (also named in situ click chemistry). Although linkages thus formed are mostly passive, some of them have shown to significantly contribute to the protein binding through for instance hydrogen bonding and stacking interactions. Biocompatible reactions and click chemistry are a formidable source of inspiration for developing such new protein-directed ligations. In this study, we report a proximity-induced thiol-yne synthesis of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Not only this example widens the arsenal of Kinetic target-guided synthesis (KTGS) eligible reactions, but the obtained product displayed unsuspected photophysical properties. The corresponding vinyl sulfide linkage conjugated to a coumarin core proved to be engaged in a monodirectional Z to E photoisomerization process. Further investigations guided by theoretical calculations showed that fine-tuning of the nature of the substituents on the coumarin moiety allows to obtain a bidirectional photochemical process, thus discovering a new photoswitching moiety, displaying moreover fluorescence properties. Due to the spectral tunability of coumarin derivatives, this work should open new opportunities for the design of vinyl sulfide-based photoswitch systems with modular photophysical properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solvent and Substrate Induced Chiroptical Inversion in Amphiphilic, Biocompatible Glycoconjugate Supramolecules: Shape&#8208;persistent Gelation, Self&#8208;healing, and Antibacterial Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We showed solvent and substrate&#8208;dependent chiral inversion of a few glycoconjugate supramolecules.&#160;  Z&#8208;F&#8208;Gluco, where D&#8208;Glucosamine has been attached chemically with the Cbz&#8208;protected L&#8208;Phenylalanine in the C&#8208;terminus, forms self&#8208;healing hydrogel via intertwining of the nanofibers wherein the gelators undergo lamellar packing in the &#946;&#8208;sheet secondary structures with a single chiral handedness. Dihybrid Z&#8208;F&#8208;Gluco nanocomposite gel has been prepared by in situ formation of AgNPs in the gel, which enhances the mechanical properties of the composite gel by physical cross&#8208;linking without altering the packing pattern. In contrast, Z&#8208;L&#8208;Gluco bearing L&#8208;Leucine moiety does not form hydrogel rather it forms organogel. Interestingly, the chiral handedness of the aggregates of Z&#8208;L&#8208;Gluco can be reversed by choosing suitable solvents. In addition to self&#8208;healing behavior, Z&#8208;L&#8208;Gluco gel revealed shape persistency. Further, Z&#8208;F&#8208;Gluco hydrogel is benign, non&#8208;toxic, non&#8208;immunogenic, and non&#8208;allergic to animal cells. AgNPs loaded Z&#8208;F&#8208;Gluco hydrogel showed antibacterial activity against both gram&#8208;positive and gram&#8208;negative bacteria.</dc:description>

         <title>Dihydrogen Activation with a Neutral, Intermolecular Silicon(IV)&#8208;Amine Frustrated Lewis Pair</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The heterolytic cleavage of dihydrogen constitutes the hallmark reaction of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLP). While being well&#8208;established for planar Lewis acids, such as boranes or silylium ion, the observation of the primary H2 splitting products with non&#8208;planar Lewis acid FLPs remained elusive. In the present work, we report bis(perfluoro&#8208; N &#8208;phenyl&#8208; o &#8208;amidophenolato)silane and its application in dihydrogen activation to a fully characterized hydridosilicate. The Lewis acid's strict design, the Lewis base's limited selection, and the distinct reaction conditions emphasize the narrow tolerance to achieve this fascinating process with a tetrahedral Lewis acid.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing the Peroxygenase Activity of a Cofactor&#8208;Independent Peroxyzyme by Directed Evolution Enabling Gram&#8208;Scale Epoxide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peroxygenases selectively incorporate oxygen into organic molecules making use of the environmentally friendly oxidant H2O2 with water being the sole by&#8208;product. These biocatalysts can provide &#8216;green&#8217; routes for the synthesis of enantioenriched epoxides, which are fundamental intermediates in the production of pharmaceuticals. The peroxyzyme 4&#8209;oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4&#8209;OT), catalysing the epoxidation of a variety of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes with H2O2, is outstanding because of its independence from any cost&#8208;intensive cofactor. However, its low&#8208;level peroxygenase activity and the decrease in the enantiomeric excess of the corresponding &#945;,&#946;&#8208;epoxy&#8208;aldehydes under preparative&#8208;scale conditions is limiting the potential of 4&#8209;OT. Herein we report the directed evolution of a tandem&#8208;fused 4&#8209;OT variant, which showed an ~150&#8208;fold enhanced peroxygenase activity compared to 4&#8208;OT wild type, enabling the synthesis of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;epoxy&#8208;aldehydes in milligram&#8208; and gram&#8208;scale with high enantiopurity (up to 98% ee) and excellent conversions. This engineered cofactor&#8208;independent peroxyzyme can provide new opportunities for the eco&#8208;friendly and practical synthesis of enantioenriched epoxides at large scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Multistep Continuous Flow Synthesis of Isolable NH2&#8208;Sulfinamidines via Nucleophilic Addition to Transient Sulfurdiimide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The growing interest in novel sulfur pharmacophores led to recent advances in the synthesis of some S(IV) and S(VI) motifs. However, preparation and isolation of uncommon primary sulfinamidines, the aza&#8208;analogues of sulfinamides, is highly desirable. Here we report a multistep continuous flow synthesis of poorly explored NH  2  &#8208;sulfinamidines by nucleophilic attack of organometallic reagents to  in situ  prepared  N  &#8208;(trimethylsilyl)&#8208;  N  &#8208;trityl&#8208;&#955;  4  &#8208;sulfanediimine (Tr&#8208;N=S=N&#8208;TMS). The transformation can additionally be realized under mild conditions, at room temperature, via a highly chemoselective halogen&#8208;lithium exchange of aryl bromides and iodides with  n  &#8208;butyllithium. Moreover, the synthetic potential of the methodology was assessed exploring further manipulations of the products and accessing novel S(IV) analogues of celecoxib, tasisulam, and relevant sulfinimidoylureas.</dc:description>

         <title>Pseudo&#8208;octahedral Iron(II) Complexes with Near&#8208;degenerate Charge Transfer and Ligand Field States at the Franck&#8208;Condon Geometry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Increasing the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT) excited state lifetime of polypyridine iron(II) complexes can be achieved by lowering the ligand&#8217;s p* orbital energy and by increasing the ligand field splitting.

A good metal&#8208;ligand orbital overlap to increase the ligand field splitting is achieved by optimizing the octahedricity through CO and NMe units between the coordinating pyridines which enable the formation of six&#8208;membered chelate rings.

         <title>Water Reduction and Dihydrogen Addition in Aqueous Conditions With ansa&#8208;Phosphinoborane</title>

         <dc:description>Ortho &#8208;phenylene&#8208;bridged phosphinoborane (2,6&#8208;Cl 2 Ph) 2 B&#8208;C 6 H 4 &#8208;PCy 2 1 was synthesized in three steps from commercially available starting materials. 1 reacts with H 2 or H 2 O under mild conditions to form corresponding zwitterionic phosphonium borates 1&#8208;H 2 or 1&#8208;H 2 O . NMR studies revealed both reactions to be remarkably reversible. Thus, when exposed to H 2 , 1&#8208;H 2 O partially converts to 1&#8208;H 2 even in the presence of multiple equivalents of water in the solution. The addition of parahydrogen to 1 leads to nuclear spin hyperpolarization both in dry and hydrous solvents, confirming the dissociation of 1&#8208;H 2 O to free 1 . These observations were supported by computational studies indicating that the formation of 1&#8208;H 2 and 1&#8208;H 2 O from 1 are thermodynamically favored.

         <title>Controlling Electronic Events Through Rational Structural Design in Subphthalocyanine&#8208;Corrole Dyads: Synthesis, Characterization and Photophysical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porphyrinoids are considered perfect candidates for their incorporation into electron donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) arrays due to their remarkable optoelectronic properties and low reorganization energies. For the first time, a series of subphthalocyanine (SubPc) and corrole (Cor) were covalently connected through a short&#8208;range linkage. SubPc axial substitution strategies were employed, which allowed the synthesis of the target molecules in decent yields. In this context, a qualitative synthetic approach was performed in order to reverse the expected direction of the different electronic events. Consequently, in&#8208;depth absorption, fluorescence, and electrochemical assays enabled the study of electronic and photophysical properties. Charge&#8208;separation was observed in cases of electron donating Cors, whereas a quantitative energy transfer from the Cor to the SubPc was detected in the case of electron accepting Cors.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Magnetic Materials Based on {CoIII(Tp*)(CN)3}&#8722; Cyanidometallate: Combined Magnetic, Structural and 59Co NMR Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tris&#8208;cyanido cobalt(III) building block was used to design new molecular materials: (i) a paramagnetic two&#8208;dimensional compound, (ii) a tetrametallic spin&#8208;crossover square complex. This last one shows both thermally induced and photo&#8208;induced spin transitions accompanied by changes in optical and magnetic properties. The temperature&#8208;dependent electronic states of the compounds are probed by different techniques including magnetometry and 59Co NMR spectroscopy.







Abstract
The cyanidocobaltate of formula fac&#8208;PPh4[CoIII(Me2Tp)(CN)3]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;CH3CN (1) has been used as a metalloligand to prepare polynuclear magnetic complexes (Me2Tp=hydrotris(3,5&#8208;dimethylpyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)borate). The association of 1 with in&#8197;situ prepared [FeII(bik)2(MeCN)2](OTf)2 (bik=bis(1&#8208;methylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ketone) leads to a molecular square of formula {[CoIII{(Me2Tp)}(CN)3]2[FeII(bik)2]2}(OTf)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4MeCN&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O (2), whereas the self&#8208;assembly of 1 with preformed cluster [CoII2(OH2)(piv)4(Hpiv)4] in MeCN leads to the two&#8208;dimensional network of formula {[CoII2(piv)3]2[CoIII(Me2Tp)(CN)3]2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2CH3CN}&#8734; (3). These compounds were structurally characterized via single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis and their spectroscopic (FTIR, UV&#8208;Vis and 59Co NMR) properties and magnetic behaviours were also investigated. Bulk magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal that 1 is diamagnetic and 3 is paramagnetic throughout the explored temperature range, whereas 2 exhibits sharp spin transition centered at ca. 292&#8197;K. Compound 2 also exhibits photomagnetic effects at low temperature, selective light irradiations allowing to promote reversibly and repeatedly low&#8208;spin&#8660;high&#8208;spin conversion. Besides, the diamagnetic nature of the Co(III) building block allows us studying these compounds by means of 59Co NMR spectroscopy. Herein, a 59Co chemical shift has been used as a magnetic probe to corroborate experimental magnetic data obtained from bulk magnetic susceptibility measurements. An influence of the magnetic state of the neighbouring atoms is observed on the 59Co NMR signals. Moreover, for the very first time, 59Co NMR technique has been successfully introduced to investigate molecular materials with distinct magnetic properties.

         <title>Adamantyl Side Chains as Anti&#8208;Aggregating Moieties in Dyes for Dye&#8208;Sensitized Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel triarylamine dyes are reported, that are decorated with ethyladamantyl side chains on the &#960;&#8208;spacer (BSH&#8208;2), and on the donor (BSH&#8208;3). The ethyladamantyl modified dyes display higher photovoltages than the non&#8208;modified reference dye (JK&#8208;305). DSSC devices prepared with the adamantyl decorated donor dye (BSH&#8208;3) and the anti&#8208;aggregation additive CDCA display the best PCE of the series, at 6.1&#8201;%.







Abstract
Designing and evaluating novel dye concepts is crucial for the development of the field of dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). In our recent report, the novel concept of tethering the anti&#8208;aggregation additive chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) to dyes for DSSC was introduced. Based on the performance improvements seen for this modification, the aim of this study is to see if a simplified anti&#8208;aggregation unit could achieve similar results. The following study reports the synthesis and photovoltaic characterization of two novel dyes decorated with the steric ethyladamantyl moiety on the &#960;&#8208;spacer, and on the triarylamine donor. This modification is demonstrated to be successful in increasing the photovoltages in devices employing copper&#8208;based electrolytes compared to the non&#8208;modified reference dye. The best photovoltaic performance is achieved by a device prepared with the adamantyl decorated donor dye and CDCA, this device achieves a power conversion efficiency of 6.1&#8201;% (Short&#8208;circuit current=8.3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, Open&#8208;circuit voltage=1054&#8197;mV, Fill factor=0.69). The improved photovoltaic performance seen for the adamantyl decorated donor demonstrate the potential of ethyladamantyl side chains as a tool to ensure surface protection of TiO2.

         <dc:description>
Designing photoCORMs: A new photo&#8208;induced CO&#8208;releasing molecule has been developed by using tricarbonyl rhenium(I) phthalocyanine. The distorted structures of the Re phthalocyanine complexes allowed their ultrafast excited&#8208;state dynamics to be analysed by spin&#8208;orbit coupling.







Abstract
A complex comprising one [Re(CO)3]+ unit and a phthalocyanine (Pc) ligand (Re1Pc) is shown to function as a photo&#8208;induced CO&#8208;releasing molecule (photoCORM) in the presence of O2 and a coordinative solvent under irradiation with red light, which can deeply penetrate living tissues. Transient absorption spectroscopic measurements indicate very short excited&#8208;state lifetimes and ultrafast intersystem crossing for Re1Pc and Re2Pc, which contains two [Re(CO)3]+ units. The excited&#8208;state properties are ascribed to efficient spin&#8211;orbit coupling and large Franck&#8211;Condon factors originating from the complexes&#8217; distorted structures, that is, unsymmetric coordination of [Re(CO)3]+ unit(s), one of which was confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis of a symmetrically substituted Pc with two [Re(CO)3]+ units. Re1Pc represents a promising red&#8208;light&#8208;driven photoCORM that can be applied in biological environments or therapeutic applications.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Functionalisation of Peptides on the Solid Phase by an Iodination&#8208;Substitution Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An on&#8208;resin iodination&#8208;substitution approach is established to easily introduce various functional modifications into peptides at a late synthesis stage. The method allows access to methionine&#8208;like thioethers, selenoethers, thioglycosides, pyridinium salts, and fluorescent labels in a combinatorial manner. Using this approach, we synthesised an iFRET&#8208;based ZnII sensor by labelling a designed &#946;&#8208;sheet minireceptor prototype with 7&#8208;mercapto&#8208;4&#8208;methylcoumarin.







Abstract
The functionalisation of peptides at a late synthesis stage holds great potential, for example, for the synthesis of peptide pharmaceuticals, fluorescent biosensors or peptidomimetics. Here we describe an on&#8208;resin iodination&#8208;substitution reaction sequence on homoserine that is also suitable for peptide modification in a combinatorial format. The reaction sequence is accessible to a wide range of sulfur nucleophiles with various functional groups including boronic acids, hydroxy groups or aromatic amines. In this way, methionine&#8208;like thioethers or thioesters and thiosulfonates are accessible. Next to sulfur nucleophiles, selenols, pyridines and carboxylic acids were successfully used as nucleophiles, whereas phenols did not react. The late&#8208;stage iodination&#8208;substitution approach is not only applicable to short peptides but also to the more complex 34&#8208;amino&#8208;acid WW domains. We applied this strategy to introduce 7&#8208;mercapto&#8208;4&#8208;methylcoumarin into a switchable ZnII responsive WW domain to design an iFRET&#8208;based ZnII sensor.

         <title>Dehydrocoupling Polymerization: Poly(silylether) Synthesis by Using an Iron &#946;&#8208;Diketiminate Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the iron&#8208;catalyzed polymerizations of diol and silane monomers to obtain 14 different poly(silylether) products with number average molecular weights (  M  n  ) up to 36.3 kDa. The polymerization reactions developed in this study are operationally simple and applicable to 1&#176; and 2&#176; silane monomer substrates and a range of benzylic and aliphatic diol substrates as well as one polyol example. The polymers were characterized by IR spectroscopy, DSC and TGA and, where solubility allowed,  1  H,  13  C{  1  H},  29  Si{  1  H} NMR spectroscopies, GPC and MALDI&#8208;TOF were also employed. The materials obtained displayed low  T  g  values (&#8722;70.6 to 19.0 &#176;C) and were stable upon heating up to  T  &#8211;5%,Ar  421.6 &#176;C. A trend in  T  &#8211;5%,Ar  was observed whereby use of a 2&#176; silane leads to higher  T  &#8211;5%,Ar  compared to those obtained using a 1&#176; silane. &#160;Reaction monitoring was undertaken by  in situ  gas evolution studies coupled with GPC analysis to follow the progression of chain&#8208;length growth which confirmed a condensation polymerization&#8208;type mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing dual&#8208;state emission in maleimide fluorophores through fluorocarbon functionalisation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, a library of trifluoroethyl substituted aminomaleimide derivatives are reported with small size and enhanced emissions in both solution and solid&#8208;state. A di&#8208;CH  2  CF  3  substituted aminochloromaleimide exhibits the most efficient dual state emission (  &#934;  f  &gt; 50% in solution and solid&#8208;state), with reduced quenching from protic solvents. This is attributed to the reduction of electron density on the maleimide ring and suppressed &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking in the solid&#8208;state. This mechanism was explored in&#8208;depth by crystallographic analysis, and modelling of the electronic distribution of HOMO&#8208;LUMO isosurfaces and NCI plots. Hence, these dual&#8208;state dyes overcome the limitations of single&#8208;state luminescence and will serve as an important step forward for this rapidly developing nascent field.</dc:description>

         <title>Gel&#228;nder Molecules with Orthogonal Joints: Synthesis of Macrocyclic Dimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Orthogonal joints, understood as connections with an angle of 90&#176;, were introduced in the design of the &#8220;Gel&#228;nder&#8221; model compounds  1  and  2  . The banister, consisting of a conjugated carbazole dimer linked by either 1,3&#8208;butadiyne (  2  ) or a single thiophene (  1  ), wraps around an axis composed of a phthalimide dimer due to the dimensional mismatch of both subunits, which are interconnected by phenylene rungs. The &#8220;Gel&#228;nder&#8221; structure was assembled from a monomer comprising the 1,4&#8208;diaminobenzene rung with one amino substituent as part of a 4&#8208;bromo phthalimide subunit forming the orthogonal junction to the axis, and the other as part of a masked 2&#8208;ethynyl carbazole as orthogonal joint to the banister. The macrocycle was obtained by two sequential homocoupling steps. A first dimerization by a reductive homocoupling assembled the axis, while an oxidative acetylene coupling served as ring closing reaction. The formed butadiyne was further derivatized to a thiophene, rendering all carbons of the model compound sp  2  hybridized. Both helical structures were fully characterized and chirally resolved. Assignment of the enantiomers was achieved by simulation of chiroptical properties and enantiopure synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalysis by [Ga4L6]12&#8208; Metallocage on the Nazarov Cyclization The Basicity of Complexed Alcohol is Key</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Nazarov cyclization is investigated in solution and within K  12  [Ga  4  L  6  ] supramolecular organometallic cage by means of computational methods.

         <title>CO2&#160;Laser&#8208;Induced Graphene with Appropriate Oxygen Species as Efficient Electrocatalyst to Hydrogen Peroxide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxygen species functionalized graphene (O&#8208;G) is an effective electrocatalyst for electrochemically synthesizing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by a 2 e&#8208;&#160;oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The type of oxygen specie and degree of carbon crystallinity in O&#8208;G are the two key factors for the high catalytic performance of the 2 e&#8208;&#160;ORR. However, the general preparing method of O&#8208;G by the precursor of graphite has the disadvantages of consuming massive strong oxidant and washing water. Herein, the biomass&#8208;based graphene with tunable oxygen species is rapidly fabricated by CO2&#160;laser. In a flow cell setup, the laser&#8208;induced graphene (LIG) with abundant active oxygen species and graphene structure shows high catalytic performance including high Faraday efficiency (over 78%) and high mass activity (814 mmolgcatalyst&#8208;1&#160;h&#8208;1), superior to most of the reported carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts.&#160;Density function theory demonstrates the meta&#8208;C atoms at nearby C&#8208;O,&#160;O&#8208;C=O&#160;species are the key catalytic sites. Therefore, we develop one facile method to rapidly convert biomass to graphene electrocatalyst used for H2O2&#160;synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient and Selective of CO2 Electroreduction to HCOOH over Bismuth&#8208;Based Bromide Perovskites in Acidic Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal halide perovskites, primarily used as optoelectronic devices, have not been applied for electrochemical conversion due to their insufficient stability in moisture. Herein, we demonstrate two bismuth&#8208;based perovskites as novel electrocatalysts to convert CO2 into HCOOH in aqueous acidic media (pH 2.5), exhibiting a high Faradaic efficiency for HCOOH of &gt;80% in a wide potential range from &#8722;0.75 to &#8722;1.25 V. Their structural evolution against water were dynamically monitored by in situ spectra. Theoretical calculations further reveal that the formation of intermediate OCHO* on bismuth sites of Cs3Bi2Br9(111) play a pivotal role toward HCOOH production, which has a lower energy barrier than that on Cs2AgBiBr6(001) surfaces. Significantly, we found that CO2 react with protons instead of water can enhance CO2 reduction rate and suppress hydrogen evolution by avoiding carbonate formation in acidic electrolytes. This work paves the way for the extensive investigation of halide perovskites in aqueous systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8211;ligand Lability and Ligand Mobility Enables Framework Transformation via Ligand Release in a Family of Crystalline 2D Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional coordination polymers exhibit ligand extrusion into the vapour phase on heating to undergo an extensive structural reorganisation involving bond breaking and formation, ligand migration and reorientation. The reactions occur with retention of crystallinity and have been followed in&#8197;situ by PXRD.







Abstract
A family of seven silver(I)&#8208;perfluorocarboxylate&#8208;quinoxaline coordination polymers, [Ag4(O2CRF)4(quin)4] 1&#8211;5 (RF=(CF2)n&#8208;1CF3)4, n=1 to 5); [Ag4(O2C(CF2)2CO2)2(quin)4] 6; [Ag4(O2CC6F5)4(quin)4] 7 (quin=quinoxaline), denoted by composition as 4&#8201;:&#8201;4&#8201;:&#8201;4 phases, was synthesised from reaction of the corresponding silver(I) perfluorocarboxylate with excess quinoxaline. Compounds 1&#8211;7 adopt a common 2D layered structure in which 1D silver&#8208;perfluorcarboxylate chains are crosslinked by ditopic quinoxaline ligands. Solid&#8208;state reaction upon heating, involving loss of one equivalent of quinoxaline, yielding new crystalline 4&#8201;:&#8201;4&#8201;:&#8201;3 phases [Ag4(O2C(CF2)n&#8208;1CF3)4(quin)3]n (8&#8211;10, n=1 to 3), was followed in&#8197;situ by PXRD and TGA studies. Crystal structures were confirmed by direct syntheses and structure determination. The solid&#8208;state reaction converting 4&#8201;:&#8201;4&#8201;:&#8201;4 to 4&#8201;:&#8201;4&#8201;:&#8201;3 phase materials involves cleavage and formation of Ag&#8722;N and Ag&#8722;O bonds to enable the structural rearrangement. One of the 4&#8201;:&#8201;4&#8201;:&#8201;3 phase coordination polymers (10) shows the remarkably high dielectric constant in the low electric field frequency range.

         <title>Nonbonding/Bonding Molecular Orbital Regulation of Nitrogen&#8208;Boron&#8208;Oxygen&#8208;embedded Blue/Green Multiresonant TADF Emitters with High Efficiency and Color Purity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;pure&#8208;blue/green OLED: Three types of novel (N&#8722;B&#8722;O) embedded MR&#8208;TADF emitters are successfully developed for high efficiency and narrow emission organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs). In this study, the molecular orbital characters were regulated by adjusting the position of heteroatoms to achieve color&#8208;tunable of MR&#8208;TADF. The ultra&#8208;pure&#8208;blue/green devices exhibit high external quantum efficiency over 20&#8201;% and narrow full width at half maximum less than 50&#8197;nm.







Abstract
In this study, we synthesized and characterized multiresonant thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) materials embedded with nitrogen&#8208;boron&#8208;oxygen (N&#8722;B&#8722;O), exhibiting color&#8208;tunability between blue and green, namely NBO, m&#8208;DiNBO, and p&#8208;DiNBO. The three emitter materials showed a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 96&#8201;%/25&#8197;nm, 87&#8201;%/17&#8197;nm, and 99&#8201;%/19&#8197;nm, respectively. For m&#8208;DiNBO and p&#8208;DiNBO, the emission color could be tuned from blue to green by regulating the nonbonding/bonding molecular orbital characters. Owing to the expanded planar molecular structure, m&#8208;DiNBO and p&#8208;DiNBO showed high horizontal dipole ratio (&#920;) of 88&#8201;% and 92&#8201;%, respectively. OLEDs were prepared with NBO, m&#8208;DiNBO, and p&#8208;DiNBO, exhibiting high external quantum efficiencies of 16.8&#8201;%, 24.2&#8201;%, and 21.6&#8201;%, respectively. NBO and m&#8208;DiNBO exhibited pure&#8208;blue emission with CIE coordinates of (0.137, 0.142) and (0.126, 0.098), respectively. p&#8208;DiNBO showed pure&#8208;green emission with a CIE coordinate of (0.258, 0.665).

OLEDs were prepared with &lt;b&gt;NBO&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;m-DiNBO&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;p-DiNBO&lt;/b&gt;, exhibiting high external quantum efficiencies of 16.8&#8201;%, 24.2&#8201;%, and 21.6&#8201;%, respectively. &lt;b&gt;NBO&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;m-DiNBO&lt;/b&gt; exhibited pure-blue emission with CIE coordinates of (0.137, 0.142) and (0.126, 0.098), respectively. &lt;b&gt;p-DiNBO&lt;/b&gt; showed pure-green emission with a CIE coordinate of (0.258, 0.665).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Situ Grignard Metalation Method for the Synthesis of Hauser Bases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnesium is an alkaline&#8208;earth metal of low reactivity. Therefore, direct metalation of primary and secondary amines yielding Hauser bases is impossible. The addition of bromoethane to a suspension of Mg metal and amine in an ethereal solvent allows the smooth syntheses of large amounts of amidomagnesium bromides without intermediate work&#8208;up procedures.







Abstract
The in situ Grignard Metalation Method (iGMM) is a straightforward one&#8208;pot procedure to quickly produce multigram amounts of Hauser bases R2N&#8208;MgBr which are valuable and vastly used metalation reagents and novel electrolytes for magnesium batteries. During addition of bromoethane to a suspension of Mg metal and secondary amine at room temperature in an ethereal solvent, a smooth reaction yields R2N&#8208;MgBr under evolution of ethane within a few hours. A Schlenk equilibrium is operative, interconverting the Hauser bases into their solvated homoleptic congeners Mg(NR2)2 and MgBr2 depending on the solvent. Scope and preconditions are studied, and side reactions limiting the yield have been investigated. DOSY&#8197;NMR experiments and X&#8208;ray crystal structures of characteristic examples clarify aggregation in solution and the solid state.

         <title>Rapid Discrimination of Bacterial Drug Resistivity by Array&#8208;Based Cross&#8208;Validation Using 2D MoS2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spot the difference: A sensor array comprising cationic 2D MoS2 and GFP has been used to discriminate bacterial analytes. By using this optimized sensor array, bacteria and lysates belonging to different types and with different amounts of drug resistivity were successfully classified. Cross validation of blind samples through combined analysis of bacterial cell and lysates provided improved detection accuracy.







Abstract
The precise discrimination of microbes based on family, class and drug resistivity is essential for the early diagnosis of infectious diseases. Information about the type and strength of drug resistivity can help the analyst to prescribe a suitable antibiotic at the proper dosage to completely eradicate microbes without giving them a chance to gain further resistance. Herein, we propose a sensor array based on the use of cationic two&#8208;dimensional MoS2 units and green fluorescence protein as building blocks. Cationic surfaces of receptors with various functionality were suitable for tunable interaction with anionic surfaces of microbes. The array successfully discriminates six different bacterial strains. The versatile ability of the receptors to bind with the wild&#8208;type as well as the corresponding ampicillin&#8208;resistant strain contributed significantly to rapid detection with high sensitivity. The optimized array was able to classify five different types and three different extents of drug&#8208;resistant variants of Escherichia coli by using bacteria cells and lysates. Finally, we have introduced the cross identification method using both bacteria cells and lysates and we found a great enhancement of detection in sensitivity and accuracy. This is the first report of this approach, which can be extended to many other methods for better accuracy in array&#8208;based detection.

         <title>Chemically Laminated 2D Bis(terpyridine)metal Polymer Films: Formation Mechanism at the Liquid&#8211;Liquid Interface and Redox Rectification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterolaminated bis(terpyridine)metal films have been prepared by sequential coordination at the H2O/CH2Cl2 interface. In the reaction, metal ions permeate the grown films from the aqueous phase to react with the terpyridine ligand on the organic&#8208;phase side. The heterolaminated films show unique redox behavior based on electron transfer mediation, and a stable rectification character owing to the difference in electron transfer kinetics between the two layers. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Nishihara and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201316).

         <title>Self&#8208;assembled nano&#8208;filamentous zeolite catalyst to realize efficient one&#8208;step ethanol synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The non&#8208;petroleum synthesis route of ethanol from syngas with methyl acetate (MA)&#160;as the core intermediate product has been confirmed as an excellent industrialization route for high purity ethanol production. However, as the central part of this tandem&#8208;catalysis path, the carbonylation of dimethyl ether (DME) to MA is limited by the undesirable catalytic activity and stability of zeolite catalysts. Herein, a facile inhibitor&#8208;assisted strategy was developed for constructing self&#8208;assembled nano&#8208;MOR zeolites without using expensive or complex template. A nano&#8208;filamentous MOR zeolite with 70 nm crystal diameter was synthesized by controlling the crystal growth with a specific inhibitor. The performance of self&#8208;assembled nano&#8208;MOR catalysts was remarkably outstanding in DME carbonylation. The&#160;highest STY of MA was achieved over NF&#8208;MOR, which was significantly improved&#160;comparing with that of the traditional ES&#8208;MOR (3780 mmol/(kg&#183;h) vs 1368 mmol/(kg&#183;h)). One&#8208;step ethanol synthesis was realized by combining the MOR catalyst and an innovative self&#8208;reduced CZ/SiO2 catalyst. The tailor&#8208;made NF&#8208;MOR&amp;CZ/SiO2 combination obtained the highest STY of ethanol,&#160;4 times of the conventional ES&#8208;MOR&amp;CZ combination (1800 mmol/(kg&#183;h) vs 476 mmol/(kg&#183;h)). Our self&#8208;assembled zeolites synthetic strategy opens a new way for&#160;fabrication of high&#8208;performance zeolites for industrial applications in catalytic conversions of C1 small molecules to high value&#8208;added chemicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Unravelling the Role of the Pentafluoroorthotellurate Group as a Ligand in Nickel Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pentafluoroorthotellurate group (teflate, OTeF5) is able to form species, for which only the fluoride analogues are known. Despite nickel fluorides being widely investigated, nickel teflates have remained elusive for decades. By reaction of [NiCl4]2&#8211; and neat ClOTeF5, we have synthesized the homoleptic [Ni(OTeF5)4]2&#8211; anion, which presents a distorted tetrahedral structure, unlike the polymeric [NiF4]2&#8211;. This high&#8208;spin complex has allowed the study of the electronic properties of the teflate group, which can be classified as a weak/medium&#8208;field ligand, and therefore behaves as the fluoride analogue also in ligand&#8208;field terms. The teflate ligands in [NEt4]2[Ni(OTeF5)4] are easily substituted, as shown by the formation of [Ni(NCMe)6][OTeF5]2 by dissolving it in acetonitrile. Nevertheless, careful reactions with other conventional ligands have enabled the crystallization of nickel teflate complexes with different coordination geometries, i.e. [NEt4]2[trans&#8208;Ni(OEt2)2(OTeF5)4] or [NEt4][Ni(bpyMe2)(OTeF5)3].</dc:description>

         <title>Bioorthogonal Click of Colloidal Gold Nanoparticles to Antibodies In Vivo</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Combining nanotechnology and bioorthogonal chemistry for theranostic strategies offers the possibility to develop next generation nanomedicines. These materials are thought to increase therapeutic outcome and improve current cancer management. Due to their size, nanomedicines target tumors passively. Thus, they can be used for drug delivery purposes. Bioorthogonal chemistry opens up for pretargeting. Higher target&#8208;to&#8208;background drug accumulation ratios can be achieved. Pretargeting can also be used to induce internalization processes or trigger controlled drug release. Colloidal gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have attracted widespread interest as drug delivery vectors within the last decades. Here, we demonstrate &#8208; for the first time &#8208; the possibility to successfully ligate AuNPs in vivo to pretargeted monoclonal antibodies. We believe that this possibility will facilitate the development of AuNPs for clinical use and ultimately, improve state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art patient care.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Ternary Adduct Formation of Yttrium Polyaminocarboxylates Leads to Small Molecule Capture and Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work we exploit the chemistry of yttrium complexes for small molecule capture and activation. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and density functional theory (DFT) studies were used to investigate the  in situ  formation of solution state ternary yttrium&#8208;acetate, yttrium&#8208;bicarbonate, and yttrium&#8208;pyruvate adducts with a range of polyaminocarboxylate chelates. These studies reveal that [Y(DO3A)(H  2  O)  2  ] (H  3  DO3A &#8722; 1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane&#8208;1,4,7&#8208;tricarboxylic acid) and [Y(EDTA)(H  2  O)  2  ]  &#8208;  (H  4  EDTA &#8722; ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) are able to form ternary adducts with bicarbonate and pyruvate. In the latter, unusual decarboxylation of pyruvate to form acetic acid and CO  2  was observed and further studied using SABRE&#8208;hyperpolarised  13  C NMR (SABRE &#8722; signal amplification by reversible exchange) to provide information about the reaction timescale and lifetime of intermediates involved in this conversion. The work presented demonstrates that yttrium complexes can capture and activate small molecules, which may lead to novel and useful applications of this metal in catalysis and medical imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Two Tags in One Probe: Combining Fluorescence&#8208; and Biotin&#8208;based Detection of the Trypanosomal Cysteine Protease Rhodesain</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rhodesain is the major cysteine protease of the protozoan parasite  Trypanosoma brucei  and a therapeutic target for sleeping sickness, a fatal neglected tropical disease. We designed, synthesized and characterized a bimodal activity&#8208;based probe that binds to and inactivates rhodesain. This probe exhibited an irreversible mode of action and extraordinary potency for the target protease with a  k  inac  /  K  i  value of 37,000 M  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  . Two reporter tags, a fluorescent coumarin moiety and a biotin affinity label, were incorporated into the probe and enabled highly sensitive detection of rhodesain in a complex proteome by in&#8208;gel fluorescence and on&#8208;blot chemiluminescence. Furthermore, the probe was employed for microseparation and quantification of rhodesain and for inhibitor screening using a competition assay. The developed bimodal rhodesain probe represents a new proteomic tool for studying  Trypanosoma  pathobiochemistry and antitrypanosomal drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanoarchitectonics in the Ionothermal Synthesis for Nucleation of Crystalline Potassium Poly(heptazine imide) Towards an Enhanced Solar&#8208;Driven H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solar&#8208;driven selective oxygen reduction reaction on polymeric carbon nitride framework is one of the most promising approaches toward sustainable H  2  O  2  production. Potassium poly(heptazine imide) (PHI), with regular metal sites in the framework and favorable crystalline structure, is highly active for photocatalytic selective 2e oxygen reduction to produce H  2&#173;  O  2  . By introducing NH  4  Cl into the eutectic KCl&#8208;LiCl salt mixture, the PHI framework exhibits a remarkable performance for photocatalytic production of H  2  O  2  , e.g., a record high H  2  O  2  photo&#8208;production rate of 29.5  &#956;mol h  &#8722;1  mg  &#8722;1  . The efficient photocatalytic performance is attributed to the favorable properties of the new PHI framework, such as improved porosity, negatively shifted LUMO position, enhanced exciton dissociation and charges migration properties  .  A mechanistic investigation by quenching and electron spin resonance technique reveals the critical role of superoxide radicals for the formation singlet oxygen, and the singlet oxygen is one of the critical intermediates towards the formation of the H  2  O  2  by proton extraction from the ethanol.</dc:description>

         <title>Indole&#8208;based long&#8208;wavelength fluorescent probes for bioimaging of S&#8208;nitrosylation in mitochondria</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>S  &#8208;Nitrosylation has been found to play an important role in regulating mitochondrial function. However, probes for detection of protein  S  &#8208;nitrosylation in mitochondria remain unexplored. Herein, a novel 4&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)vinyl&#8208;substituted indole was designed, exhibiting a long&#8208;wavelength emission and a high fluorescent quantum yield. Functionalization of the 7&#8208;position of the indole ring with an arylphosphine ester resulted with probes with efficient mitochondria&#8208;targeting ability. Furthermore, the indole&#8208;arylphosphine displayed a significant fluorescence enhancement upon exposure to  S  &#8208;nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) at low micromolar concentrations in A431 cells. Taken together, this study provides a new indole&#8208;based fluorescent probe with a unique long&#8208;wavelength emission for direct detection of  S  &#8208;nitrosylation in mitochondria, which may represent a powerful tool for understanding the critical roles of  S  &#8208;nitrosylation within mitochondria of living organisms.</dc:description>

         <title>A Tumor&#8208;Targeting Dual&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Activatable Photodynamic Molecular Beacon for Precise Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A multifunctional&#160;photodynamic molecular beacon (PMB) has been designed and synthesized which contains an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)&#8208;targeting cyclic peptide and a trimeric phthalocyanine skeleton in which the three zinc(II) phthalocyanine units are each substituted with a glutathione (GSH)&#8208;responsive 2,4&#8208;dinitrobenzenesulfonate (DNBS) quencher and are linked&#160;via&#160;two cathepsin B&#8208;cleavable GFLG peptide chains. This tailor&#8208;made conjugate is fully quenched in the native form due to the photoinduced electron transfer effect of the DNBS moieties and the self&#8208;quenching of the phthalocyanine units. It can target the EGFR overexpressed in cancer cells, and after receptor&#8208;mediated endocytosis, it can be activated selectively by the co&#8208;existence of intracellular GSH and cathepsin B, both of which are also overproduced in cancer cells, in terms of fluorescence emission and singlet oxygen generation. The cell&#8208;selective behavior of this PMB has been demonstrated using a range of cancer cells with different expression levels of EGFR, while the stimuli&#8208;responsive properties have been studied both&#160;in vitro&#160;and in various aqueous media. The overall results show that this advanced PMB, which exhibits several levels of control of the tumor specificity, is a promising photosensitizer for precise antitumoral photodynamic therapy.</dc:description>

The overall results show that this advanced PMB, which exhibits several levels of control of the tumor specificity, is a promising photosensitizer for precise antitumoral photodynamic therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhanced Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting of Black Silicon Photoanode by pH&#8208;Dependent Copper&#8208;Bipyridine Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since the water oxidation half&#8208;reaction requires the transfer of multi&#8208;electrons and the formation of O&#8208;O bond, it&#8217;s crucial to investigate the catalytic behaviours of semiconductor photoanodes. In this work, a bio&#8208;inspired copper&#8208;bipyridine catalyst of Cu(dcbpy) is decorated on the nanoporous Si photoanode (black Si,  b  &#8208;Si). Under AM1.5G illumination, the  b  &#8208;Si/Cu(dcbpy) photoanode exhibits a high photocurrent density of 6.31 mA cm  &#8208;2  at 1.5 V  RHE  at pH 11.0, which is dramatically improved from the  b  &#8208;Si photoanode (1.03 mA cm  &#8208;2  ) and  f  &#8208;Si photoanode (0.0087 mA cm  &#8208;2  ). Mechanism studies demonstrate that  b  &#8208;Si/Cu(dcbpy) has improved light&#8208;harvesting, interfacial charge&#8208;transfer, and surface area for water splitting. More interestingly,  b  &#8208;Si/Cu(dcbpy) exhibits a pH&#8208;dependent water oxidation behaviour with a minimum Tafel slope of 241 mV/dec and the lowest overpotential of 0.19 V at pH 11.0, which is due to the monomer/dimer equilibrium of copper catalyst. At pH ~11, the formation of dimeric hydroxyl&#8208;complex could form O&#8208;O bond through a redox isomerization (RI) mechanism, which decreases the required potential for water oxidation. This in&#8208;depth understanding of pH&#8208;dependent water oxidation catalyst brings insights into the design of dimer water oxidation catalysts and efficient photoanodes for solar energy conversion.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Since the water oxidation half-reaction requires the transfer of multi-electrons and the formation of O-O bond, it&#8217;s crucial to investigate the catalytic behaviours of semiconductor photoanodes. In this work, a bio-inspired copper-bipyridine catalyst of Cu(dcbpy) is decorated on the nanoporous Si photoanode (black Si,  b  -Si). Under AM1.5G illumination, the  b  -Si/Cu(dcbpy) photoanode exhibits a high photocurrent density of 6.31 mA cm  -2  at 1.5 V  RHE  at pH 11.0, which is dramatically improved from the  b  -Si photoanode (1.03 mA cm  -2  ) and  f  -Si photoanode (0.0087 mA cm  -2  ). Mechanism studies demonstrate that  b  -Si/Cu(dcbpy) has improved light-harvesting, interfacial charge-transfer, and surface area for water splitting. More interestingly,  b  -Si/Cu(dcbpy) exhibits a pH-dependent water oxidation behaviour with a minimum Tafel slope of 241 mV/dec and the lowest overpotential of 0.19 V at pH 11.0, which is due to the monomer/dimer equilibrium of copper catalyst. At pH ~11, the formation of dimeric hydroxyl-complex could form O-O bond through a redox isomerization (RI) mechanism, which decreases the required potential for water oxidation.

         <title>Expanding Catch and Release DNA Decoy (CRDD) Technology with Pyrimidine Mimics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catch and Release DNA Decoys (CRDDs) utilize photochemically responsive nucleoside analogues that generate abasic sites upon exposure to light. Herein, we describe the synthesis and evaluation of four candidate CRDD monomers containing nucleobases that mimic endogenous pyrimidines: 2&#8208;nitroimidazole (2NI), 2&#8208;nitrobenzene (2&#8208;NB), 2&#8208;nitropyrrole (2&#8208;NP) and 3&#8208;nitropyrrole (3&#8208;NP). Our studies reveal that 2&#8208;NI and 2&#8208;NP can function as CRDDs, whereas 3&#8208;NP and 2&#8208;NB undergo decomposition and transformation to a higher&#8208;ordered structure upon photolysis, respectively. When incorporated into DNA, 2&#8208;NP undergoes rapid photochemical cleavage of the anomeric bond (1.8 min half&#8208;life) to yield an abasic site. Finally, we find that all four pyrimidine mimics show significantly greater stability when base&#8208;paired against the previously reported, 7&#8208;nitroindole CRDD monomer. Our work marks the expansion of CRDD technology to both purine and pyrimidine scaffolds.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of the Intramolecular Hydrogen Bond on the Fluorescence of 2&#8208;ortho&#8208;Aminophenyl Pyridines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dynamic nature of Excited State Intramolecular Proton Transfer (ESIPT) and its effect on the emission spectrum is an attractive strategy to create multi&#8208;emissive dyes. Here we describe the behavior of a series of hydrogen&#8208;bonded triphenylpyridines having a set of donor&#8208;acceptor combinations that allowed us to perceive the influence of each substitution on the photophysical properties of the dyes. The susceptibility of these ESIPT moieties to pH variations was also studied, elucidating that the level of protonation had a significant effect on the emission colour. The assignment of each emission band was made using DFT and td&#8208;DFT calculations that were in agreement with the experimental results. This study emphasizes the versatility of triphenylpyridines that can be synthetized effortlessly with logical C&#8208;2, C&#8208;4 and C&#8208;6 independent substitution, in order to have the desired ESIPT modulation and subsequent multi&#8208;emission response.</dc:description>
