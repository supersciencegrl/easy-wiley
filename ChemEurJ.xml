         <title>Insight into the Simultaneous Super&#8208;Stable Mineralization of AsO43&#8722;, Cd2+ and Pb2+ Using MgFe&#8208;LDHs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, the MgFe&#8208;CO3 and MgFe&#8208;NO3&#160;were synthesized by Separate Nucleation and Aging Steps and ion&#8208;exchange method, respectively. The MgFe&#8208;CO3 demonstrated the maximum saturation adsorption capacity of 55.86, 543.48 and 1597.4 mg g&#8722;1 for single AsO43&#8722;, Cd2+ and Pb2+ in aqueous solution, while MgFe&#8208;NO3 exhibited 92.50, 387.59 and 869.56 mg g&#8722;1, respectively. Kinetic and thermodynamic results for mineralization of single AsO43&#8722;, Cd2+ and Pb2+ fitted well with the pseudo&#8208;second&#8208;order kinetic model and Langmuir isotherm model, indicating the occurrence of chemisorption and monolayer adsorption for both MgFe&#8208;CO3 and MgFe&#8208;NO3. Furthermore, simultaneous mineralization of AsO43&#8722;, Cd2+ and Pb2+ with &gt; 99.0% efficiency in 240 min in aqueous solution and &gt; 81.1% efficiency in 14 days in soil can be achieved by both MgFe&#8208;CO3 and MgFe&#8208;NO3. Preliminary experiments indicated that the released Mg2+ ions from MgFe&#8208;CO3 and MgFe&#8208;NO3 were capable to promote the emergence and growth of red bean seedlings. The&#160;AsO43&#8722; anions were adsorbed on the laminate of LDHs, whereas the Pb3(OH)2(CO3)2 was the mineralization product for both MgFe&#8208;CO3 and MgFe&#8208;NO3. In terms of Cd2+, CdCO3 was obtained as a mineralization product for MgFe&#8208;CO3, while CdCO3 and Cd(OH)2 can be detected due to the slow transformation of MgFe&#8208;NO3 to MgFe&#8208;CO3 in air.</dc:description>

         <title>Heavier Diferrocenylpnictogenium Ions</title>

Four shades of pastel: The synthesis, reactivity and in&#8208;depth characterisation of cationic group 15 carbene analogues is reported.







Abstract
The synthesis, characterization and reactivity of the diferrocenylphosphenium ion [Fc2P]+ was extended to the heavier diferrocenylpnictogenium ions, [Fc2E]+ (E=As, Sb, Bi). The lighter diferrocenylnitrenium ion, [Fc2N]+, was detected by mass spectrometry, but could not be isolated. The molecular structures of [Fc2E]+ (E=P, As, Sb, Bi) reveal intramolecular coordination of the iron atoms, which counterbalance the electron deficiency of the pnictogens without affecting the strong Lewis acidities, which were determined according to the method of Gutmann and Beckett. The (electro&#8722;)chemical oxidation and reduction afforded the dications [Fc2E]2+ (E=P (unstable), As) and the neutral dipnictogens Fc2EEFc2 (E=P, As).

         <title>&#960;&#8208;mers and &#960;&#8208;dimers: Two Radical Supramolecular Interactions &#8211; A Tutorial Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#960;&#8208;mers and &#960;&#8208;dimers are two radical interactions being easily confused on account of their similarities. This tutorial review introduces i) a clear definition of each interaction, ii) their main physico&#8208;chemical differences observable by major analytical techniques (X&#8208;Ray, UV/Vis/NIR, EPR, NMR and electrochemistry), iii) some of their thermodynamic features, and iii) examples showing strategies to enhance their stability (using a covalent spacer, a confined environment and mechanical bonds).







Abstract
In this review, the difference between &#960;&#8208;mers (pimers) and &#960;&#8208;dimers (pi&#8208;dimers) will be discussed. Often interchanged or confused in the literature, these two radical interactions lead to different or even opposite physico&#8208;chemical behaviors. This review aims at clarifying the terms &#960;&#8208;mers and &#960;&#8208;dimers and at describing their main physico&#8208;chemical properties to address their differences. Finally, selected literature examples exhibiting the successive formation of &#960;&#8208;mers and &#960;&#8208;dimers within the same systems will be detailed to emphasize the physico&#8208;chemical changes occurring upon conversion.

         <title>Organocatalytic Electrophilic Arene Amination: Rapid Synthesis of 2&#8208;Quinolones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fresh approach to 2&#8208;quinolone synthesis! This study presents an innovative organocatalytic electrophilic arene amination strategy, enabling the efficient synthesis of a diverse array of 2&#8208;quinolones &#8211; a critical scaffold with extensive industrial applications. By circumventing traditional metal&#8208;based catalysts, this approach paves the way for advancements in multiple sectors, offering a sustainable and versatile alternative.







Abstract
For decades, the synthesis of 2&#8208;quinolones, a crucial structural motif in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, has relied heavily on costly noble metal complexes and structurally complex ligands. Despite considerable efforts from synthetic chemists, a mild, metal&#8208;free, environmentally friendly, and cost&#8208;effective approach has remained elusive. This study introduces a robust, metal&#8208;free synthetic platform that leverages an innovative organoiodine&#8208;catalyzed electrophilic arene C(sp2)&#8722;H amination strategy to efficiently produce a wide range of new and modifiable 2&#8208;quinolones. Moreover, this study allows ready synthetic access to novel 8&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;quinolones, uncovering new chemical spaces with significant potential for medicinal applications.

         <title>Metal Pyrazolyl&#8208;Diphosphonate Pillared Materials as Heterogeneous Catalysts in the Mukaiyama&#8208;Type Aerobic Olefin Epoxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coordination of the organic PZDP linker to alkaline earth or transition metals yields 2D&#8208;pillared metal phosphonate frameworks under solvothermal or hydrothermal conditions. The structures of the materials are determined and the catalytic performance of Co&#8208;PZDP is tested in the Mukaiyama olefin epoxidation, achieving high yields of the corresponding epoxides.







Abstract
The structural variability and chemical stability of metal phosphonates under harsh conditions are attractive attributes that have drawn considerable attention in recent years. As the need for more sustainable solutions rises, the demand for novel and tolerant materials also increases. Thus, herein we report, for the first time, the synthesis of a novel diphosphonic organic linker named pyrazole diphenyl phosphonate (PZDP), envisioning the fabrication of durable metal phosphonates. In view of this, a series of M&#8208;PZDP materials (M=Ca, Sr, Ba, Zn and Co) were synthesized employing either solvothermal or hydrothermal methods. The crystal structures of the Ca, Sr, Zn, and Co derivatives were determined revealing a 2D&#8208;pillared architecture. Zn&#8208;PZDP is an anionic framework with dimethylammonium cations. The Co&#8208;PZDP compound was tested as a heterogeneous catalyst in olefin epoxidation employing molecular oxygen.

         <title>A Novel Methacryloyl&#8211;Masked NIR Fluorescent Probe for Detection of Cysteine and Its Application in Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the NIR fluorescent probe SNC&#8208;Cys that allows Cys detection. It is a highly sensitive and selective fluorescent probe that detects Cys based on the ICT photo mechanism. The probe works through Michael addition. SNC&#8208;Cys was successfully employed in the endogenous and exogenous imaging of Cys in living cells with good cell permeability.







Abstract
Cysteine (Cys) detection is recognized as an essential element in this investigation due to the critical function of Cys in several physiological processes in living organisms. A new NIR fluorescent probe SNC&#8211;Cys has been synthesized by incorporating a five&#8208;membered malononitrile derivatized ring as an electron withdrawing group, and a methacryloyl group detection moiety for cysteine. After adding Cys, SNC&#8211;Cys shows an emission of 654&#8197;nm and further works as a &#8220;Turn&#8211;on&#8221; probe via ICT photomechanism. SNC&#8211;Cys has high sensitivity and selectivity for Cys (LOD=0.46&#8197;&#956;M) and can discriminate it from other closely related amino acids, molecules with structural similarity, and in some cases very close functional group likeness. Thus, these results allow the effective imaging of Cys in living A549 cells which indicates good cell permeability and high applicability in live cell imaging. This study anticipates that SNC&#8211;Cys could be an aid in the detection of Cys&#8211;relevant diseases.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Coreactants Enhanced Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One plus one is greater than two: A remarkable electrochemiluminescence (ECL) enhancement of Ru(bpy)32+/TPrA is observed by introducing another coreactant, TEOA, with a 10.8&#8208;fold increase of ECL intensity and 1.7&#8208;fold extension of ECL layer. The enhancement was interpreted by a chemical oxidation route, in which TEOA+&#8901; acts as an enhancer to produce more TPrA+&#8901; and meanwhile allow the remote formation of TPrA+&#8901;. This dual&#8208;coreactants strategy works not only in solution with freely diffusive Ru(bpy)32+ but also on Ru(bpy)32+&#8208;functionalized microbeads, showing promise in ECL&#8208;based bioassay and microscopy.







Abstract
The electrochemiluminescence (ECL) of ruthenium(II) tris(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl) (Ru(bpy)32+) with tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine (TPrA) as the good coreactant can be unexpectedly enhanced by a weak coreactant, such as triethanolamine (TEOA). First, the intensity of ECL emitted by Ru(bpy)32+/TPrA can be remarkably amplified by 10.8&#8208;fold after adding some amount of TEOA. Moreover, the ECL layer thickness, measured by self&#8208;interference spectroscopy, is also doubled. The enhancement far exceeding the superposition of respective contribution of TPrA and TEOA was elucidated by a &#8220;chemical oxidation mechanism&#8221;, in which TEOA+&#8901; acts as a chemical enhancer to oxidize TPrA in solution and to accelerate significantly the ECL reaction kinetics. This mechanism was proved by single&#8208;photon counting experiment and finite element simulations. In addition, the dual&#8208;coreactants strategy works well not only in solution with freely diffusive Ru(bpy)32+, but also on Ru(bpy)32+&#8208;functionalized microbeads, suggesting that ethanolamines could act as cheap, easily available and low&#8208;background enhancers for ECL&#8208;based bioanalysis and microscopy.

         <title>Scalable Bulk Synthesis of Phase&#8208;Pure &#947;&#8208;Sn3N4 as a Model for an Argon&#8208;Flow&#8208;Mediated Metathesis Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phase&#8208;pure, crystalline &#947;&#8208;Sn3N4 was synthesized via reaction of argon&#8208;diluted SnCl4 with Mg3N2. The exothermic nature of the reaction is controlled by slow mixing of the starting materials with a continuous flow of argon. The reaction can be further facilitated by the use of a tin flux. This new method not only leads to pure &#947;&#8208;Sn3N4 material, but is also promising for the synthesis of other nitride materials.







Abstract
Nitrides represent a promising class of materials for a variety of applications. However, bulk synthesis remains a challenging task due to the stability of the N2 molecule. In this study, we introduce a simple and scalable approach for synthesizing nitride bulk materials. Moderate reaction temperatures are achieved by using reactive starting materials, slow and continuous mixing of the starting materials, and by dissipating heat generated during the reaction. The impact on the synthesis of using different starting materials as nitrogen source and the influence of a flux were examined. &#947;&#8208;Sn3N4 was selected as the model compound. The synthesis of pure &#947;&#8208;Sn3N4 bulk material on a large scale has still been a challenge, although a few synthesis methods were already described in the literature. Here we synthesized &#947;&#8208;Sn3N4 by metathesis reaction of argon&#8208;diluted SnCl4 with Li3N, Mg3N2 or Ca3N2 as nitrogen sources. Products were characterized by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy, dynamic flash combustion analysis, hot gas extraction analysis, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption and emission spectroscopy. Additionally, single&#8208;crystal diffraction data of &#947;&#8208;Sn&#8323;N&#8324;, previously unavailable, were successfully collected.

         <title>Nutation Spectroscopy of a Weakly Interacting Heterobimetallic Spin System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An heterobimetallic VIV&#8722;CuII complex is synthesized by a modular process involving external coordination sites of a porphyrinato ligand and a PdII linker. Pulsed Electron Paramagnetic Resonance experiments, in particular spin nutation spectroscopy at variable microwave powers or magnetic fields, reveals weak but non&#8208;negligible magnetic interactions and the presence of two transitions of different tipping angles.







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;An heterobimetallic V&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complex is synthesized by a modular process involving external coordination sites of a porphyrinato ligand and a Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; linker. Pulsed Electron Paramagnetic Resonance experiments, in particular spin nutation spectroscopy at variable microwave powers or magnetic fields, reveals weak but non-negligible magnetic interactions and the presence of two transitions of different tipping angles.

         <title>Translating Solid&#8208;Phase Conformational Memory in the Prophecy of Multi&#8208;stimuli Responsive Low Molecular Weight Gels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing flexible non&#8208;polar functional groups, a bis&#8208;urea based low molecular weight organogelator is synthesized. Three distinct polymorphic crystalline phases of the gelator were isolated with noticeable solubility differences. Different stimuli like heat&#8208;cool, sonication, shaking, grinding showed varied gelling performances among the polymorphic phases further corroborated with their solubility parameter in the respective gelling solvents.







Abstract
Polymorphism and its screening to select the best&#8208;performing form is in high demand. In low molecular weight organogels (LMWG), gelators are designed as they contain flexible groups, functionalities capable of varied H&#8208;bonding, and increased the potential to show polymorphism. We synthesized a bis&#8208;urea based LMWG G1 and isolated three distinct polymorphic phases (Form I, II, and III). G1 polymorphs showed noticeable differences in solubility; precisely, Form I is highly soluble compared to the other two. Gel screening was carried out for all three polymorphs using different stimuli like heat&#8208;cool, sonication, shaking, and grinding. Among the polymorphs, Form I was found to have better gelling ability which was reflected by the solvent scope, thermal stability (gel&#8208;sol transition temperature Tgel), minimum gelator concentration (M.G.C.), stimuli&#8208;responsiveness, morphology, and rheological properties. The differences in their gelation performance among the three polymorphs are associated with their solubility parameter. Stimuli like sonication, shaking, and grinding triggered Form I to form a gel. Form II and III responded to heat&#8208;cool stimuli only due to poor solubility. Therefore, it is noted crucial to add polymorph screening as an integral part of the gel synthesis to avoid problems associated with reproducibility in the gel prophecy of LMWG systems.

         <title>An Organic Vapor&#8208;Responsive Actuator Based on a Novel Urea Macrocycle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymeric composite incorporating a novel urea macrocycle as a filler has been shown to act as a soft actuator that is responsive to organic solvent vapors. The actuation mechanism arises from a crystalline phase transition of the urea macrocycle at the molecular level, driven by host&#8211;guest interactions.







Abstract
The mechanical actuation of smart materials has garnered considerable attention in biological and medical research due to their ability to mimic biological processes at both molecular level, such as conformational changes in individual compounds, and at the macroscopic level, where polymeric substrates respond to external stimuli. In this study, we present a polymeric composite incorporating a novel urea macrocycle as a filler, forming a soft actuator that responds to various organic solvent vapors. The underlying actuation mechanism is attributed to crystalline phase transition of urea macrocycle, driven by the host&#8211;guest interactions with diverse guest molecules. This work provides valuable insights for advancing the design of supramolecular hosts in smart material applications.

         <title>Stereodivergent Macrocyclization in Dynamic Chiral Confinement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Full stereodivergence in a macrocyclization event can be achieved by implementing a dynamic chirality switching into robust confinement using a repeatedly switchable chiral capsule. The consecutive chirality switching enables the confined reactions of an enclosed achiral substrate to sequentially install multiple chirality with full stereocontrol by changing only a sequence of physical stimuli.







Abstract
The absolute and relative configurations of a macrocyclic natural product bearing multiple chirality have a crucial influence on its physical and biological properties. Nevertheless, their preparation with full stereocontrol remains largely unexplored in synthetic community. Here, we show a stereodivergent macrocyclization under dynamic chiral confinement in which the stepwise chirality switching of a chiral space directs complete stereocontrol. To confine a substrate in a dynamic chiral space, we used a chiral capsule enclosing a substrate which is collectively switchable in the chirality in response to external stimuli, but their conformations are firmly fixed by subsequent self&#8208;assembly. The consecutive chirality switching enables the confined reactions of an enclosed achiral substrate to sequentially install diverse chirality on a macrocycle product with full stereocontrol in a single pot operation, thus changing only a sequence of physical stimuli enables access to a remarkable stereodivergence in a macrocyclization process.

         <title>Open Sn Framework Structure Hosting Bi Guest atoms&#8211;Synthesis, Crystal and Electronic Structure of Na13Sn26Bi</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Na13Sn26&#8208;xBi1+x is the first compound in the Na&#8208;Sn&#8208;Bi ternary system. Sn atoms form a three&#8208;dimensional open framework hosting Na and also one loosely bound Bi guest atom. Interestingly, for both x=0 and x=2 results a semiconducting small indirect band gap Zintl compound owning the same atomic structure but different electron numbers.







Abstract
The large variety of structures of Zintl phases are generally well understood since their anionic substructures follow bonding rules according to the valence concept. But there are also exceptions, which make the semiconductors especially interesting in terms of structure&#8208;property relationships. Although several Na&#8208;Sn&#8208;Pnictides with a variety of structural motives are known, up to this point no ternary compound in the Na&#8208;Sn&#8208;Bi system has been described. In this paper we present the Zintl&#8208;phase Na13Sn25.73Bi1.27 comprising a complex, open&#8208;framework structure of Sn atoms, with one mixed Sn/Bi site, hosting Na atoms. An additional Bi atom is loosely connected with only weak contacts to the framework filling a larger cavity within the network. According to band structure calculations of the two ordered variants with either full occupation of the mixed site with Sn or Bi, resulting in Na13Sn26Bi and Na13Sn24Bi3, respectively, both compounds are semiconductors with band gaps of 0.5&#8197;eV. A comparison of the band structures with the structurally related binary compounds Na5Sn13 and Na7Sn12 shows that only the perfectly charge balanced Na7Sn12 is a semiconductor whereas Na5Sn13 is metallic. The rather specific electronic situation in the ternary compound is traced back to the loosely bound Bi atom, which acts as a guest atom according to Bix@Na13Sn26&#8208;yBiy, with x=1 and y=0.27, capable to change its oxidation state and thus to uptake additional electrons allowing the system to be a semiconductor. Therefore, Na13Sn25.73Bi1.27 can be understood as a rare example of an open framework structure of Sn atoms comprising Bi atoms in the cavities.

The participation of both the nitrile (&#8722;CN) groups led to the concurrent construction of three heterocycles viz. furan, pyrrole, and pyridine through forming C&#8722;C, C=C, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;N, and C=N bonds.

         <dc:description>
An unprecedented bis(hexahapto)&#8208;coordination mode for terphenyl substituents was identified in reaction of deprotonated Ar*GeH3 with [(COD)RhCl]2 followed by chloride abstraction. The germanium bridged cationic dirhodium complex features a delocalized [Rh&#8722;Ge&#8722;Rh] &#960;&#8208;system. The [RhGeRh]&#8208;cation abstracts a chloride ligand from transition metal chloride complexes and acts as metal&#8208;only Lewis base chelating the metal fragments.







Abstract
Terphenylgermanium Ar*Ge [Ar*=C6H3(2,6&#8208;Trip)2, Trip=2,4,6&#8208;C6H2iPr3] was found to act as a novel &#956;2&#8208;Ge&#8208;bis(hexahapto&#8208;Trip) bridging ligand. Deprotonated terphenyl germanium trihydride [Li(thf)3][Ar*GeH2] (1) undergoes reductive elimination and transfer of hydrogen in reaction with dimeric [(COD)RhCl]2 to yield the dinuclear complex [Ar*GeRh(COE)RhCl(COD)] (2). Subsequent chloride abstraction from compound 2 using Na[BArF4] or Li[Al(OtBuF)4] results in the cationic complexes [Ar*GeRh(COE)Rh(COD)][WCA] (3) {WCA: [BArF4]&#8722; (ArF=C6H3&#8211;3,5&#8208;(CF3)2), [Al(OtBuF)4]&#8722;}. Ligand exchange of olefin for CO yields the carbonyl complex [Ar*Ge(Rh(CO))2][BArF4] (4). In an alternative approach to the synthesis of carbonyl complex 4, [Li(thf)3][Ar*GeH2] (1) was treated with [Rh(CO)2Cl]2 leading to the isolation of a hexanuclear rhodium cluster [(&#956;3&#8208;Ar*Ge)2{Rh(CO)2}6(&#956;3&#8208;H)2] (5) in reasonable yield. In reactions with [Rh(CO)2Cl]2 or [Ph3PAuCl] complex 4 abstracts the chloride ligand and forms tetranuclear complexes featuring a GeRh3&#8208; or GeRh2Au&#8208;rectangle, [Ar*GeCl(Rh3(CO)4)][BArF4] (6), or [Ar*GeCl{Rh2(CO)2}(AuPPh3)][BArF4] (7).

         <title>Regulating Zn Deposition Manner by Confining the Reactivity of Free Water in the Electric Double Layer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address the poor reversibility of Zn anode, we propose to use benzotriazole as decent electrolyte additive to confine the reactivity of free water in the electric double layer, which can adsorb on the surface of Zn metal and then react with Zn2+ to form solid Zn&#8208;BTA complexes on the Zn anode surface.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn ion batteries (AZIBs) are promising candidates of next&#8208;generation energy storage devices with high safety and theoretical capacity. However, the irreversibility of metallic Zn anode, attributed to dendrite growth and water decomposition, severely limits the cycling durability of AZIBs and restricts their further development. Herein, a facile surface engineering strategy is put forward to tackle the issue of poor reversibility of the Zn anode. Benzotriazole (BTA) is employed as a functional additive of ZnSO4 electrolyte to confine the reactivity of free water situated in the electric double layer (EDL). Experimental results and theoretical simulation reveal that BTA can preferiencially adsorb onto the Zn surface to uniform Zn2+ ion distribution and alleviate H2O&#8208;involved side reactions like hydrogen evolution, and surface passivation. Consequently, in BTA&#8208;modulated aqueous electrolyte, the lifespan of the Zn anode is extended from 170&#8197;h&#8211;1092&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The reversibility improvement of Zn anode also benefits the cycling durability of full devices including supercapacitors and batteries. Zn||I&#8322; batteries assembled in as&#8208;designed electrolyte witness only 11.3&#8201;% capacity decay over 17000 cycles at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, far outstripping that observed in ZnSO4 counterpart (~4675 cycles). The design criteria proposed in this study offers a new concept for the development of regulation additives that confine the reactivity of free water in the electric double layer.

         <title>Site&#8208;specifically Phosphorylated Hsp90C&#8208;terminal Domain Variants Provide Access to Deciphering the Chaperone Code.</title>

Expressed Protein Selenoester Ligation (EPSL) allows for an efficient generation of semi&#8208;synthetic Hsp90 CTD bearing site&#8208;specific phosphorylations in a traceless manner to facilitate elucidation of the chaperone code.







Abstract
The ubiquitous molecular chaperone Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is pivotal in many cellular processes through folding of client proteins under stressed and normal conditions. Despite intensive research on its function as a chaperone, the influence of posttranslational modifications on Hsp90 (the &#8216;chaperone code&#8217;), and its interactions with co&#8208;chaperones and client proteins, still remains to be elucidated. The C&#8208;terminal domain (CTD) of Hsp90 is essential for formation of the active homodimer state of Hsp90 and contains recognition sites for co&#8208;chaperones and client proteins. Here we used expressed protein selenoester ligation to introduce site&#8208;selective phosphorylations in the Hsp90 CTD, while preserving the native amino acid sequence. The two phosphorylations do not affect the overall secondary structure, but in combination, slightly decrease the thermal stability of the CTD. The Hsp90 CTD functions as a chaperone in decreasing aggregation of model client proteins, but the C&#8208;terminal phosphorylations do not significantly alter the anti&#8208;aggregation activity for these clients. The optimization of expressed protein selenoester ligation (EPSL) to carry out several steps in one pot provides an efficient route to access site&#8208;specifically modified Hsp90 CTD variants, allowing the generation of Hsp90 variants with site&#8208;specific PTMs to decipher the chaperone code.

The C-terminal domain (CTD) of Hsp90 is essential for formation of the active homodimer state of Hsp90 and contains recognition sites for co-chaperones and client proteins. Here we used expressed protein selenoester ligation to introduce site-selective phosphorylations in the Hsp90 CTD, while preserving the native amino acid sequence. The two phosphorylations do not affect the overall secondary structure, but in combination, slightly decrease the thermal stability of the CTD. The Hsp90 CTD functions as a chaperone in decreasing aggregation of model client proteins, but the C-terminal phosphorylations do not significantly alter the anti-aggregation activity for these clients. The optimization of expressed protein selenoester ligation (EPSL) to carry out several steps in one pot provides an efficient route to access site-specifically modified Hsp90 CTD variants, allowing the generation of Hsp90 variants with site-specific PTMs to decipher the chaperone code.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Luminescent Aceno[6]helicenones by Intramolecular Radical Cyclization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbo[n]helicenes are poor emitters with the emission peak in purple or blue region. Inserting a carbonyl group into the skeleton shifts the emission to longer wavelengths and greatly improves the fluorescence quantum yield. The color can be tuned by shifting the position of the carbonyl.







Abstract
Helicenes and helicenoid structures are promising candidates for future applications exploiting circularly polarized light. Ideal candidates should possess near&#8208;quantitative photoluminescence quantum yield, a high luminescence dissymmetry factor and an adjustable HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap. However, carbo[n]helicenes are poorly luminescent compounds and they absorb light mainly in the ultraviolet region. Here we show that the incorporation of a carbonyl group into helical scaffold significantly improves the fluorescence quantum yield and shifts the absorption to visible region. Although the carbonyl group is commonly considered as detrimental to efficient emission, fluorescence quantum yields up to &#934;=0.43 were recorded. A straightforward synthetic approach to a highly luminescent tetraceno[6]helicenone and an aza analogue has been developed. The key step is a radical cyclization which is achieving dehydrative &#960;&#8208;extension. The aza&#8208;analogue was incorporated as an emitter in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) and showed good performance.

         <title>Functionalization of Emulsion Interfaces: Surface Chemistry Made Liquid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Emulsions are widely used disperse liquid/liquid systems but usually carrying inert interfaces. Here, we overview the existing methods to functionalize their interfaces, which we categorize into coating strategies and methods based on emulsifiers as function carriers. We emphasize the importance of their liquid nature, from current challenges to perspectives for future studies and applications.







Abstract
Disperse systems, and emulsions in particular, are currently massively used in fields as varied as food industry, cosmetics, health care and environmentally&#8208;friendly materials. To meet increasingly precise needs or targeted applications, these systems need to be endowed with new functionalities at their interfaces, in addition to their composition and structural properties. However, due to the fragility of drops and the low reactivity of their surface, conventional solid surface chemistry cannot be used for such a purpose. Several specific emulsion interface functionalization techniques have thus been developed for targeted systems and applications, but a general framework has yet to be drawn. In this review, we attempt to present these methods in a unified way through the prism of what we may call &#8220;liquid surface chemistry&#8221;. We propose to categorize existing methods into drop&#8208;coating strategies, including layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer techniques and polymer coating, with a particular focus on polydopamine, and emulsifier&#8208;carrier approaches involving particles and/or amphiphilic molecules. They are discussed in a transversal way, highlighting the underlying physico&#8208;chemical principles and providing a comparative analysis of their advantages, current limitations and potential for improvement. We also propose future directions and opportunities, involving for instance DNA&#8208;based programmability or artificial intelligence, which could make liquid surface chemistry more versatile and controlled.

         <title>Advances in Pyridine C &#8211; H Functionalizations: Beyond C2 Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pyridine core is a crucial component in numerous FDA&#8208;approved drugs and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulated agrochemicals. It also plays a significant role in ligands for transition metals, alkaloids, catalysts, and various organic materials with diverse properties, making it one of the most important structural frameworks. However, despite its significance, direct and selective functionalization of pyridine is still relatively underdeveloped due to its electron&#8208;deficient nature and the strong coordinating ability of nitrogen. Among the variety of synthetic transformation, direct functionalization of C&#8208;H bond is straightforward and atom economical approach and it&#8217;s advantageous for late&#8208;stage functionalization of pyridine containing drugs. In recent years, innovative strategies for regioselective C&#8208;H functionalization of pyridines and azines have emerged, offering numerous benefits such as high regioselectivity, mild conditions, and enabling transformations that were challenging with traditional methods. This review emphasizes the latest advancements in meta and para&#8208;C&#8208;H functionalization of pyridines through various approaches, including pyridine phosphonium salts, photocatalytic methods, temporary de&#8208;aromatization, Minisci&#8208;type reactions, and transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H activation techniques. We discuss the advantages and limitations of these current methods and aim to inspire further progress in this significant field.</dc:description>

In this work, we proposed a strategy for the design of multifunctional, superior ion&#8208;conducting IPCs with bistability in both magnetic and electric properties, moreover, we successfully prepared and thoroughly characterized such an IPC, [PMPyr][Ni(mnt)2] (1; PMPyr&#8314; = N&#8208;propyl&#8208;N&#8208;methylpyrrolidinium, and mnt2&#8315; = maleonitriledithiolate). Plastic crystal 1 exhibits superior ion conduction near room temperature, and its ion conductivity reaches the order of 10&#8315;&#178; S cm&#8315;&#185; at 373 K. Remarkably, the crystal&#8208;to&#8208;plastic crystal transformation results in 1 simultaneously exhibiting electrical bistability and magnetic transition. Our study paves the way for the development of new IPCs with desirable functional properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Isolation of a Staudinger&#8208;type Intermediate Utilizing a Five&#8208;membered Phosphorus&#8208;centered Biradicaloid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Staudinger reaction provides chemists with a valuable tool for the reduction of azides, which are notoriously unstable and can decompose explosively. By providing a controlled method for the conversion of azides to amines, the reaction opened up new avenues for the synthesis of various amine&#8208;containing compounds that are widely used in natural products, pharmaceuticals and polymers. The Staudinger reaction begins with the nucleophilic attack of a trivalent phosphine (usually triphenylphosphine), leading to the formation of a triazenide intermediate, a highly reactive species. Here we report how a divalent phosphorus&#8208;centered biradicaloid reacts with covalent azides and show that it is possible to capture and fully characterize the transient intermediate. The experimental data is supported by quantum chemical calculations of the reaction paths and in terms of thermodynamics and chemical bonding.</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling the Mechanism of Stereospecific Self&#8208;promoted N&#8208;Glycosylations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, the mechanism of selfpromoted
N&#8208;glycosylations is extensively investigated
through kinetic experiments, computational studies, and
nucleophilic competition experiments. Based on the findings,
the mechanism is proposed to be initiated by proton
transfer from the acidic sulfonyl carbamate to the
trichloroacetimidate, upon formation of an associated contact
ion pair. This ion pair then collapses in an SN1&#8208;like
fashion, with formation of an oxocarbeniumion&#8208;like intermediate.
According to the proposed mechanism, stereospecificity
arises from the associated nature of all intermediates
formed throughout the reaction. During the
mechanistic study, it was also found that the sulfonyl carbamates
have catalytic properties if a competing nucleophile
is present.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly of &#945;&#8208;D nucleosides to supramolecular hydrogels is described in detail. Hydrogel formation was studied on &#945;&#8208;D 2'&#8208;deoxyguanosine (&#945;&#8208;dG), and the fluorescent 8&#8208;azapurine &#945;&#8208;D nucleosides 2&#8208;amino&#8208;8&#8208;aza&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyadenosine (&#945;&#8208;2&#8208;NH2&#8208;z8Ad) and 8&#8208;aza&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyisoguanosine (&#945;&#8208;z8iGd). These compounds were prepared from &#945;&#8208;D 8&#8208;aza&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyguanosine by an activation/amination protocol followed by deamination. Protonation and deprotonation pKa values of monomeric nucleosides were determined. Fluorescence measurements displayed the pH&#8208;dependent fluorescence intensity of &#945;&#8208;D 8&#8208;azapurine nucleosides. &#945;&#8208;dG and &#945;&#8208;z8iGd self&#8208;assemble to gels that are selective for K+&#8208;ions. The &#945;&#8208;dG gel is transparent and the &#945;&#8208;z8iGd gel shows fluorescence. &#945;&#8208;2&#8208;NH2&#8208;z8Ad forms fluorescent gels in the presence of alkali metal ions of different size. SEM images exposed a large condensed and flat structure for the &#945;&#8208;dG gel, whereas the &#945;&#8208;2&#8208;NH2&#8208;z8Ad gel consists of flakes that are connected to bundles. A porous structure generated by helical cylindric fibers was found for the &#945;&#8208;z8iGd gel. All &#945;&#8208;D hydrogels showed long&#8208;term lifetime stability. The &#945;&#8208;z8iGd hydrogel in KCl solution has the highest Tgel value. The minimum gelation concentration of the hydrogels was 0.3&#8208;0.5 mg nucleoside/100 &#181;L alkali ion solution. In periodical step&#8208;strain experiments, the hydrogels of &#945;&#8208;dG and &#945;&#8208;2&#8208;NH2&#8208;z8Ad&#160;and&#160;&#945;&#8208;z8iGd&#160;displayed thixotropy.

         <title>Supramolecular Chiral Assembly of Dendritic Amphiphiles in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dendritic amphiphiles are a promising class of topological blocks for self&#8208;assembly to construct chiral supramolecular aggregates in aqueous media. Their unique dendritic geometry, structure variability and multivalence can mediate the assemblies with versatile morphologies and functions. The bulky dendritic moieties also enable the appropriate association&#8208;repulsion balance to control supramolecular growth, and simultaneously shield the assemblies with enhanced stabilities. Moreover, the crowded packing of dendritic segments facilitates the efficient chirality transfer from molecular level to supramolecular level, to achieve chirality amplification or enhancement. Dendritic moieties also provide chances to stabilize the assemblies in aqueous media through shielding and cooperative effects. The dendritic assemblies can be intriguingly made responsive to external stimuli including temperature, light, solvents or guests to switch their nanostructures or supramolecular chirality. Various dendritic amphiphiles bearing peptide or aromatic motifs have been reported in supramolecular chiral assembly, and their functional applications investigated. This review summarizes the significant progresses with a particular focus on the dendritic structural effects on supramolecular chiral assembly and the stimuli&#8208;responsiveness in aqueous media.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Planar hypercoordination has intrigued researchers for decades, yet hydrogen remained absent from this category until recently. Despite some advancements, further exploration of the emerging field of planar hypercoordinate hydrogen chemistry is still necessary. Herein, we report a D4h symmetric H&#169;Li4Au4&#8722; cluster containing a planar tetracoordinate hydrogen (ptH) center. Both density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio calculations revealed that designed H&#169;Li4Au4&#8722; is a real global minimum. Meanwhile, it also possesses excellent dynamic stability. This stability is dominated by electrostatic interactions, and reinforced by multicenter covalent bonds rather than any aromaticity. Interestingly, it is the first superhalogen anion in the ptH cluster and is expected to experimental synthesis and characterization</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand Engineering Toward Robust Sodium Storage in Self&#8208;Supported Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium&#8208;ion batteries capable of charging and discharging rapidly and durably are eagerly demanded to replace current lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, large Na+ ions need more space to accommodate them. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks are promising anode materials, and their structure and performance are governed by organic ligands. Herein, we report a ligand engineering to design metal&#8208;organic frameworks with large conjugated naphthalene&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarboxylic acid. Self&#8208;supported arrays of metal&#8208;organic frameworks reveal robust sodium storage when used as a binder&#8208;free anode. The uniquely long and conjugated aromatic ligands endow the metal&#8208;organic frameworks with rich sites to accommodate Na+ ions, thus enabling a high reversible capacity for sodium storage.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sodium-ion batteries capable of charging and discharging rapidly and durably are eagerly demanded to replace current lithium-ion batteries. However, large Na+ ions need more space to accommodate them. Metal-organic frameworks are promising anode materials, and their structure and performance are governed by organic ligands. Herein, we report a ligand engineering to design metal-organic frameworks with large conjugated naphthalene-2,6-dicarboxylic acid. Self-supported arrays of metal-organic frameworks reveal robust sodium storage when used as a binder-free anode. The uniquely long and conjugated aromatic ligands endow the metal-organic frameworks with rich sites to accommodate Na+ ions, thus enabling a high reversible capacity for sodium storage. As a result, such metal-organic frameworks exhibit a high capacity of 330 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1000 mA g&#8211;1 with remarkable rate capability and cycling performance. This work provides an exciting ligand strategy to design high-capacity metal-organic framework materials and would find extensive applications in various energy storage systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Photolockable Polyaromatic Capsule Designed via Regiochemical Substitution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocontrol over host frameworks is an elegant way to manipulate host&#8208;guest composites, yet the majority of previous systems suffer from long irradiation time and narrow guest scope, and are restricted to intramolecular photoreactions in organic solvents. Herein we present a photolockable polyaromatic capsule with improved guest binding abilities in water. The capsule assembles from bent amphiphiles featuring two 2&#8208;subsutituted anthracene panels, which shows high stability against dilution and undergoes intermolecular [4+4] photo&#8208;oligomerization upon short light irradiation (&lt;10 min). The photolocked capsule provides a roughly spherical framework, with an average, core diameter of ~3 nm, composed of amphiphilic oligomers (e.g., trimer). The new capsule shows improved host ability (up to 10&#8208;fold) in water toward various hydrophobic compounds (e.g., organic and metal&#8208;complex dyes), as compared with an analogous, non&#8208;photolockable capsule with 9&#8208;subsutituted anthracene panels. In addition, the resultant dye&#8208;loaded capsules are also successfully photolocked via short irradiation with high retention of the bound dyes.</dc:description>

         <title>Imaging Dihydrogen Bond&#8208;Driven Assembly of Borazine on Au(111)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dihydrogen bonding&#160;is a peculiar type of attractive interaction occurring between a partially positively charged hydrogen atom and a partially negatively charged hydrogen atom. Borazine represents a prototypical molecule exhibiting dihydrogen bonding in both gas phase, as well as in its crystalline form. For borazine assemblies on solid surfaces, a direct observation and characterization of dihydrogen bonding has remained elusive, possibly due to an intricate interplay of substrate&#8208;molecule and intermolecular interactions. Here we present evidence of dihydrogen bonding occurring in borazine assemblies on a Au(111) surface. By means of low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, we unveiled distinct configurations, exhibiting single and double dihydrogen bonding. Density functional theory calculations elucidate the interplay between substrate adsorption and intermolecular interactions to stabilize the formation of borazine dimers on Au(111), being the building blocks for the formation of larger assemblies.</dc:description>

         <title>Impact of Dihedral Angle in Conjugated Organic Cation on the Structures and Properties of Organic&#8208;Inorganic Lead Iodides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conjugated organic cations are intriguing for organic&#8208;inorganic halide perovskites due to their direct participation in the optoelectronic properties of hybrid materials. In conjugated cations, the dihedral angle, or torsion angle, between adjacent aromatic rings is a critical secondary structural element. This angle influences not only the shape of the cations but also the overlap between the &#960;&#8208;orbitals on adjacent rings, thereby affecting their electronic properties. Understanding how variations in the dihedral angle impact the structure and properties of hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic metal halides (HOIMHs) is fundamentally important. In this study, we utilized 2,2'&#8208;dimethyl bipyridinium as the organic cation, reacting it with PbI&#8322; to form hybrid lead iodides. Remarkably, variations in the dihedral angle between the two pyridinium rings resulted in the formation of two distinct crystal structures with different band gaps. Our findings demonstrate that manipulating the dihedral angle offers a novel approach to controlling the structures and properties of hybrid metal halides with conjugated cations.</dc:description>

         <title>CoFe Hydroxide Nanospheres for Enhanced Alkaline Water Splitting and Seawater Oxidation:Anion Doping Effects of Fluorine and Carbonate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

The catalyst F&#8208;CoFe(OH)&#8208;CO3/NF with three&#8208;dimensional nanosphere structure, which promotes the exposure of active sites through an increase in specific surface area, thereby enhancing both mass and charge transfer pathways. Furthermore, partial oxidation of CoFe hydroxide to CoFe (oxy)hydroxide as the active center can accelerating the adsorption of oxygen&#8208;related intermediates, which improves the corrosion resistance of alkaline electrolyte and seawater.







Abstract
Green hydrogen production can be achieved through electrolysis of fresh water or the use of renewable energy to electrolyze seawater. However, due to the low activity and poor stability of oxygen evolution reaction catalysts, direct electrolysis of alkaline seawater faces significant challenges. Herein, The catalyst F&#8208;CoFe(OH)&#8208;CO3/NF with three&#8208;dimensional nanosphere structure was prepared, The introduction of CO32&#8722; into the intermediate layer of CoFe hydroxide improves the corrosion resistance of alkaline electrolyte and the doping of F&#8722; is to design three&#8208;dimensional layered nanostructures, increase the active site, and accelerate the diffusion of the electrolyte. By in&#8197;situ Raman analysis, partial oxidation of CoFe hydroxide to CoFe (oxy)hydroxide as the active center can accelerating the adsorption of oxygen&#8208;related intermediates. In 1&#8197;M KOH, it requires overpotentials of 210&#8197;mV and 251&#8197;mV to drive current densities of 10 and 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. And it remained stable at the current density of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 120&#8197;h in 1&#8197;M KOH. F&#8208;CoFe(OH)&#8208;CO3/NF can also catalyzes the decomposition of electrolytic seawater. Compared with hydroxide, anion&#8208;doped carbonate hydroxide is more efficient and stable in electrolyte solution, which is of great importance for the development of a new stable electrocatalyst for water decomposition.

         <title>From Double&#8208;Stranded Helicates to Abiotic Double Helical Supramolecular Assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Foldamers are synthetic oligomers that can spontaneously adopt compact, ordered, and stable folded conformations, due to the establishment of intramolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions. These secondary structures can also aggregate into complex supramolecular assemblies. These review focuses on the self&#8208;assembly of double helical structures based on intermolecular interactions between both complementary strands.







Abstract
The folding of oligomeric strands is the method that nature has selected to generate ordered assemblies presenting spectacular functions. In the purpose to mimic these biomacromolecules and extend their properties and functions, chemists make important efforts to prepare artificial secondary, tertiary, and even quarternary structures based on folded abiotic backbones. A large variety of oligomers and polymers, encoded with chemical informations, were designed, synthesized and characterized, and the establishment of non&#8208;covalent interactions lead to complex and functional supramolecular architectures resulting from a spontaneous self&#8208;assembly process. The association of complementary molecular strands into double helical structures is a common structural pattern of nucleic acids and proteins, so the synthesis of bio&#8208;inspired double helices has emerged as an important subject. In recent years, a number of synthetic oligomers have been reported to form stable double helices and it was shown that the equilibrium between single and double helices can be controlled via different stimuli like the modification of the solvent or the temperature. This kind of structure presents highly interesting functions, such as molecular recognition within the cavity of double helices, and some other potential applications will emerge in the future.

Abstract
A novel ferrocene conjugated Mn(I)&#8208;tricarbonyl complex viz [Mn(Fc&#8208;tpy)(CO)3Br] (Mn2) where, Fc&#8208;tpy=4&#8242;&#8208;ferrocenyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine was synthesized and fully characterized along with its non&#8208;ferrocene analog [Mn(Ph&#8208;tpy)(CO)3Br] Ph&#8208;tpy=4&#8242;&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine (Mn1) for ultrasound (US) activated anticancer applications. The X&#8208;ray structure of Mn2 confirmed its distorted octahedral geometry. Mn1 and Mn2, for the first time, showed US&#8208;triggered release of CO and ROS generation (1O2 and &#8901;OH) in an aqueous solution from any Mn(I)&#8208;tricarbonyl complexes, indicating its potential for synergetic CO gas therapy and sonodynamic therapy. The above&#8208;mentioned in&#8208;solution chemistry was successfully translated into in&#8197;vitro cellular models. These complexes showed unprecedented US&#8208;triggered toxicity against T&#8208;cell lymphoma and human breast cancer cells (IC50 for Mn2&lt;1&#8197;&#956;M) while were minimally toxic without US or against normal spleen and human embryonic kidney cells. Mn2 was ca. 12 fold more anticancer active than Mn1, indicating that the ferrocene conjugation augmented the US sensitivity. The apoptotic sonotoxicity of Mn2 was due to US&#8208;promoted mitochondrial depolarization via ROS generation and CO release. The apoptosis was triggered by caspase 3 activation. This is the first report of Mn(I)&#8208;tricarbonyl&#8208;based sonosensitizers for cancer SDT. Overall, this study, for the first time, establishes the effectiveness of 3d metal carbonyls in SDT.

         <title>Towards Designer Photocatalysts: Structure&#8208;Property Relationships in 2,6&#8208;Diaryl&#8208;pyryliums</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Key design parameters and linear free&#8208;energy relationships were elucidated for 2,6&#8208;diarylpyrylium photocatalysts, allowing broad range control over both photophysical and electrochemical properties. Corrections to systematic errors in computational modeling of these systems were also developed.







Abstract
Fully organic photocatalyst systems are highly attractive, not merely because they are transition&#8208;metal free, but more importantly due to their unique and often potent reactivity. A detailed understanding of the various redox states, both ground and excited state, and specifically what structural parameters control them is therefore crucial for harnessing the full potential of these systems in organic synthesis. However, unlike their organometallic counterparts, detailed structure&#8208;property relationships for organic photocatalysts are largely absent from the literature. In this study, we demonstrate linear free&#8208;energy relationships across a range of key photophysical and electrochemical properties of 2,6&#8208;diarylpyryliums. Electronic absorption and emission maxima can be carefully tuned over the ranges of 83&#8197;nm and 102&#8197;nm respectively. Intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) interactions were revealed in cases of substitution with polarizable heavy&#8208;atoms. A strong linear dependence of ground state reduction potentials on substituent electronics was observed. Notably, the excited state reduction potential, E*red, could be controlled over a range of nearly 1000&#8197;mV. Systematic errors in computational modeling of ground and excited state redox potentials were identified and corrected. We believe the quantitative structure&#8208;property relationships identified here provide foundational tools for rational and predictive organic photocatalyst design.

         <title>Triflyl [18F]Fluoride as a Solution for Base&#8208;Sensitive Late&#8208;Stage Nucleophilic Aromatic 18F&#8208;Fluorination Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we present the late&#8208;stage nucleophilic 18F&#8208;fluorination of (hetero)aryls under low&#8208;base conditions using triflyl [18F]fluoride. This method avoids the application of base and cryptand and enabled the efficient radiolabeling of a broad scope of (hetero)arenes and the successful production of clinical doses of [18F]mFBG, [18F]SynVesT&#8208;1 and [18F]FPEB in improved radiochemical yields (RCY) and/or shorter preparation times.







Abstract
Fluorine&#8208;18 is the predominant radionuclide used to label Positron Emission Tomography (PET) tracers. One outstanding challenge in nucleophilic aromatic radiofluorination reactions is the sensitivity of precursors and catalysts for basic reaction conditions, which are necessary for the work&#8208;up of [18F]fluoride, resulting in limited reproducibility. Triflyl [18F]fluoride is a new [18F]fluoride source that allows freedom in choice of type and amounts of base and cryptand. The aim of the current work is to explore the scope and limitations of triflyl [18F]fluoride in the late&#8208;stage nucleophilic aromatic 18F&#8208;fluorination of various functionalized precursors, exploring reduced amounts of base and cryptand. The assessment allowed for the application of this new nucleophilic [18F]fluoride reagent to the successful radiosynthesis of boron, stannane, hypervalent iodonium ylide and phenol substrates bearing electron&#8208;deficient, &#8208;neutral and &#8208;rich functional groups as well as the clinically relevant PET tracers [18F]FPEB, [18F]mFBG and [18F]SynVesT&#8208;1.

         <title>Flipping the Metalation of 4&#8208;Dimethylaminopyridine: Steric Repulsion versus London Dispersion Attraction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate the effective utilization of steric interactions for flipping the lithiation of 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). Introduction of a Me3Si substituent to the position 1 of DMAP or simple complexation with t&#8208;BuLi allows selective C3&#8208;lithiation, due to the steric hindrance of a C2&#8722;H bond. The utilization of i&#8208;Pr3Si substituent leads to exclusive C2&#8208;functionalization due to the dispersion interactions with organometallic bases.







Abstract
Non&#8208;covalent interactions, including the coordination of an organolithium reagent by a directing group and the steric hindrance from substituents, play a crucial role in determining the selectivity of metalation reactions. Here, we demonstrate the effective utilization of steric interactions for flipping the lithiation of 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). Introduction of a Me3Si substituent to the position 1 of DMAP or simple complexation with t&#8208;BuLi allows selective C3&#8208;lithiation, due to the steric hindrance of a C2&#8722;H bond by the bulky moiety at the pyridine nitrogen. This simple approach creates a convenient way to achieve the selective C3&#8208;functionalization of DMAP. In contrast, the utilization of an even bulkier i&#8208;Pr3Si substituent leads to exclusive C2&#8208;functionalization due to the dispersion interactions with organometallic bases. For the first time, it is demonstrated that the i&#8208;Pr3Si moiety can serve as a directing group, providing a new type of directed ortho&#8208;metalation effect.

         <title>Steric Activation in the Nazarov Cyclization of Fully Substituted Divinyl Ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Contrary to expectations, the Nazarov cyclization of fully substituted divinyl ketones bearing only electronically neutral (non&#8208;activating) substituents has been found to be extraordinarily facile. Indeed, increasing the size of R&#8208;groups, including those at the point of ring closure, can increase the cyclization rate. Steric interactions between R&#8208;groups and OA deflect the pentadienyl cation intermediate from planarity, thus raising its energy and reducing the barrier height to cyclization.







Abstract
Fully substituted divinyl ketones (fsDVKs) have long been regarded as resistant to Nazarov cyclization (NC) unless they contain strategically positioned electronically activating substituents. Here, however, we show that fsDVKs bearing only electronically neutral alkyl or aryl groups actually undergo facile NC due to steric crowding in the pentadienyl cation intermediate, which raises its energy and reduces the barrier height to cyclization. Strongly ionizing and suitably bulky acid moieties further increase the energy of this intermediate cation, favoring cyclization. These features enable NCs of fsDVKs to be employed in the ready construction of multiple contiguous all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters under mild conditions, in the absence of electronically activating groups.

     alt="Steric Activation in the Nazarov Cyclization of Fully Substituted Divinyl Ketones"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to expectations, the Nazarov cyclization of fully substituted divinyl ketones bearing only electronically neutral (non-activating) substituents has been found to be extraordinarily facile. Indeed, increasing the size of R-groups, including those at the point of ring closure, can increase the cyclization rate. Steric interactions between R-groups and OA deflect the pentadienyl cation intermediate from planarity, thus raising its energy and reducing the barrier height to cyclization.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fully substituted divinyl ketones (fsDVKs) have long been regarded as resistant to Nazarov cyclization (NC) unless they contain strategically positioned electronically activating substituents. Here, however, we show that fsDVKs bearing only electronically neutral alkyl or aryl groups actually undergo facile NC due to steric crowding in the pentadienyl cation intermediate, which raises its energy and reduces the barrier height to cyclization. Strongly ionizing and suitably bulky acid moieties further increase the energy of this intermediate cation, favoring cyclization. These features enable NCs of fsDVKs to be employed in the ready construction of multiple contiguous all-carbon quaternary stereocenters under mild conditions, in the absence of electronically activating groups.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intramolecular Pericyclic Re&#8208;hydroboration via Six&#8208;Membered Transition State: Synthesis of Fused Borolo[3,2&#8208;b]siloles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of 1,4&#8208;pentadiynes with 9&#8208;BBN&#8722;H initially leads to 2,3&#8208;dihydrosiloles with BBN and propargyl groups at the endocyclic double bond, followed by closure of the borole ring forming borolo[3,2&#8208;b]siloles with high to moderate yields. The last step proceeds by a pericyclic mechanism via a six&#8208;membered transition state and is accompanied by an unprecedented dehydroboration of the 9&#8208;BBN unit.







Abstract
We experimentally demonstrate a new type of the intramolecular reaction between non&#8208;activated alkyne units and the dialkylboryl group (9&#8208;BBN), which was previously only hypothesized and studied on a calculational level. The reaction described here can formally be classified as a 1,2&#8208;hydroboration reaction, but, in contrast to the classical mechanism via a cyclic four&#8208;membered transition state, the reaction proceeds by a pericyclic mechanism involving a six&#8208;membered transition state. In practice, the reaction allows the synthesis of a new class of the borolenes fused with silole or dihydrosilole units. Thus, the heating (125&#8201;&#176;C) of 2,3&#8208;dihydrosiloles or 2,3&#8208;dihydrosilolo[2,3&#8208;b]silole bearing 9&#8208;BBN and propargyl or dimethylpropargyl groups in positions 4 and 5, respectively, affords, in high to moderate yields, di&#8208; and tricyclic compounds containing a borolo[3,2&#8208;b]silole unit. In all cases, the reactions are accompanied by an unprecedented dehydroboration of the 9&#8208;BBN fragment, leading, in the final products, to a cyclooct&#8208;4&#8208;enyl group on the boron atom. The effects of the substituents on the rate and the selectivity of the reaction are discussed. The structures of all the new compounds have been determined from HRMS together with multinuclear 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy, the results of which are in excellent agreement with DFT calculated chemical shifts.

         <title>Regulating Solvated Sheath with Anion Chelant Enables 4.6&#8197;V Ultra&#8208;Stable Commercial LiCoO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We employ an electrolyte additive strategy to stabilize commercial LiCoO2 at high&#8208;voltage of 4.6&#8197;V. The anion&#8208;chelating agent (ACA) TPFPB promotes the F&#8208;rich CEI formation on LiCoO2, which endows Li/LCO half cells and 4&#8197;Ah Gr/LCO pouch cell with enhanced cycling stability under the high voltage condition.







Abstract
Increasing cut&#8208;off voltage of lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) (&gt;4.6&#8197;V) is an effective strategy to satisfy the ever&#8208;increasing demand for high energy density. However, the irreversible phase transition significantly destroys the structure of high&#8208;voltage LCO, especially the surface lattice. Considering that the structural stability of LCO is primarily dominated by the intrinsic merits of electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface (EEI), we explored and disclosed the operating mechanism of anion chelating agent tris(pentafluorophenyl) borane (TPFPB) and regulate the CEI layer on LCO electrode. Benefiting from the high HOMO energy level and preferential decomposition of TPFPB&#8208;PF6&#8722;, a robust LiF&#8208;rich CEI layer is constructed and greatly improves the stability of electrode/electrolyte interface. The well&#8208;designed electrolyte composed of 1&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 LiPF6 in EC/EMC with TPFPB additives endows Li/LCO half cells and 4&#8197;Ah Gr/LCO pouch cell with enhanced cycling stability under a high voltage condition. This work provides pave a new direction for the development of economical high&#8208;voltage LIBs.

         <title>Quenching Rate Constants of Lewis Base&#8208;Boryl Radical by Substrates: a Laser Flash Photolysis Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction rate constants of a Lewis base&#8208;boryl radical, 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP)&#8208;BH2&#8226;, with several methyl chlorobenzoates and chlorinated acetanilides are measured. Compared with the abstraction of the chlorine atom, the radical&#8208;addition to the carbonyl oxygen atom is more favorable as the rate&#8208;determining step in the whole reaction.







Abstract
The advanced strategy using Lewis base&#8208;boryl radicals (LBRs) has recently been proposed for the addition of alkyl substituents to the full&#8208;carbon quaternary center of an organic molecule. However, as the rate&#8208;determining step in the whole route, reaction rate constants of LBRs with substrates are extremely lacking. In this paper, 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP)&#8208;BH2&#8901; was selected as a representative of LBRs, and its reactions with six monochloro&#8208;substituted substrates, including three methyl chlorobenzoates and three chlorinated acetanilides were studied in experiments and theoretical calculations. The bimolecular reaction rate constants, kq, were determined using laser flash photolysis approach. By comparing activation energies along the two addition pathways, we have clarified the rate&#8208;determining step as the attacking to carbonyl oxygen instead of chlorine atom. Furthermore, noncovalent interaction (NCI) analyses on these substrates indicate that weak interactions, such as hydrogen&#8208;bonding and van der Waals interactions, have significant influence on the reactivity of these substrates. Our study provides concrete clues to extend this synthetic strategy.

         <title>Construction of Luminescent Terpyridine&#8208;Based Metallo&#8208;Bowties with Alkyl Chain&#8208;Bridged Dimerized Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Luminescent terpyridine (TPY)&#8208;based metallo&#8208;bowties were constructed using a flexible alkyl chain to bridge TPY building blocks, offering a novel alternative to the conventional &lt;TPY&#8208;Ru&#8208;TPY&gt; linkage. The introduction of alkyl chain guides the self&#8208;assembly into well&#8208;defined metallo&#8208;bowties while simultaneously eliminating the quenching effects commonly associated with the &lt;TPY&#8208;Ru&#8208;TPY&gt; linkage. This approach provides a versatile platform for the design and construction of complex metallo&#8208;supramolecular architectures with desired optical properties.







Abstract
Numerous metallo&#8208;supramolecules with well&#8208;defined sizes and shapes have been successfully constructed via the strong coordination interaction between terpyridine (TPY) moieties and ruthenium cations. However, the pseudo&#8208;octahedral geometry of &lt;TPY&#8208;Ru&#8208;TPY&gt; unit hampers the luminescent properties of such metallo&#8208;architectures, thus limiting their applications as optical materials. To address this issue, we herein use a flexible alkyl chain to bridge TPY building blocks, replacing conventional &lt;TPY&#8208;Ru&#8208;TPY&gt; linkage. The introduction of alkyl chain guides the self&#8208;assembly into desired architecture while simultaneously eliminating the quenching effects typically associated with the &lt;TPY&#8208;Ru&#8208;TPY&gt; linkage. More importantly, this design strategy enables the precise construction of bowtie&#8208;shaped metallo&#8208;supramolecules with significantly enhanced emission. The incorporation of alkyl chain linkage not only maintains structural integrity but also enhances optical performance, making these metallo&#8208;supramolecular assemblies highly promising for applications in advanced photonic and luminescent materials. This study offers a versatile approach to construct complex metallo&#8208;supramolecular architectures with desired optical properties.

         <title>A Nanosized {NiII18} Cluster with a &#8216;Flying Saucer&#8217; Topology Exhibiting Slow Relaxation of Magnetisation Phenomena at Both 15&#8197;K and 1.3&#8197;K</title>

A high&#8208;nuclearity {Ni18} nanosized complex with an unprecedented &#8216;flying saucer&#8217; motif has been prepared from the organic chelate &#945;&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridine&#8208;methanol (mpmH) in conjunction with bridging azido and peroxido groups. The {Ni18} compound behaves as single&#8208;molecule magnet and exhibits very rare two relaxation processes at 15 and 1.3&#8197;K.







Abstract
A high&#8208;nuclearity {Ni18} complex (1) with a unique &#8216;flying saucer&#8217; motif has been prepared from the organic chelate, &#945;&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridine&#8208;methanol (mpmH), in conjunction with bridging azido (N3&#8722;) and peroxido (O22&#8722;) ligands. Magnetic susceptibility measurements revealed the presence of both ferro&#8208; and antiferromagnetic exchange interactions between the metal centres in 1, and the stabilization of spin states with appreciable S values at two different temperature regimes. The end&#8208;on bridging azido and alkoxido groups are in all likelihood the ferromagnetic mediators, while the &#951;3:&#951;3:&#956;6&#8208;bridging peroxides most likely promote the antiparallel alignment of the metals&#8217; spin vectors, yielding an overall non&#8208;zero spin ground state for the centrosymmetric compound 1. Furthermore, the {Ni18} nanosized cluster behaves as a single&#8208;molecule magnet, exhibiting magnetic hysteresis at low temperatures and two relaxation processes at 15&#8197;K and 1.3&#8197;K, a very rare phenomenon in polynuclear magnetic 3d&#8208;metal clusters.

         <title>Model Catalytic Studies on the Thermal Dehydrogenation of the Benzaldehyde/Cyclohexylmethanol LOHC System on Pt(111)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dehydrogenation mechanism and thermal robustness of the liquid organic hydrogen carrier (LOHC) couple benzaldehyde/cyclohexylmethanol (H0&#8208;BA/H8&#8208;BA) are investigated in&#8197;situ on Pt(111) by synchrotron radiation&#8208;based photoelectron spectroscopy and temperature&#8208;programmed desorption. The results are compared with a previous study on the structurally related secondary alcohol 1&#8208;cyclohexylethanol, demonstrating the influence of the substitution degree of the alcohol group on the dehydrogenation characteristics of alcohol&#8208;functionalized LOHCs.







Abstract
We investigated the dehydrogenation reaction and the thermal robustness of the liquid organic hydrogen carrier (LOHC) couple benzaldehyde/cyclohexylmethanol on a Pt(111) model catalyst in&#8197;situ in synchrotron radiation photoelectron spectroscopy&#8208; and complementary temperature&#8208;programmed desorption experiments. The system stores hydrogen in a cyclohexyl group and a primary alcohol functionality and achieves an attractive hydrogen storage capacity of 7.0&#8197;mass&#8201;%. We observed a stepwise dehydrogenation mechanism, characterized by a low temperature dehydrogenation of the alcohol group at 235&#8197;K. However, stability limitations challenge the system's application as reversible hydrogen storage solution, as the resultant aldehyde was found to decompose during the dehydrogenation of its cyclohexyl group (between 250 and 350&#8197;K). A comparison of cyclohexylmethanol with the structurally related secondary alcohol (1&#8208;cyclohexylethanol; 6.3&#8197;mass&#8201;% hydrogen) revealed a parallel stepwise dehydrogenation pattern for both compounds, but a technically relevant superior thermal robustness of the latter, demonstrating the influence of the alcohol&#8208;group's substitution degree on the dehydrogenation characteristics of alcohol&#8208;functionalized LOHCs. Density functional theory calculations are in agreement with the experimentally observed stability trend.

         <title>Synthesis, Structures and Air&#8208;stable N&#8208;type Organic Field&#8208;effect Transistor (OFET) Properties of Functionalized&#8208;phenanthrene Conjugated Asymmetric N&#8208;heteroacenes</title>

         <dc:description>
A series of functionalized&#8208;phenanthrene conjugated asymmetric N&#8208;heteroacenes are prepared, and their applications in organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) are explored, achieving air&#8208;stable electron&#8208;transporting mobilities up to 4.27 x 10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. In particular, Br modification at certain positions of phenanthrene is proven to be beneficial in adjusting the thin&#8208;film properties for the improvement of OFET performances.







Abstract
The development of stable high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type organic semiconductors for applications in organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) under ambient conditions is desirable but challenging. To address this issue, we here synthesized a series of functionalized&#8208;phenanthrene conjugated asymmetric N&#8208;heteroacenes, where the phenanthrene moiety was modified by N substitution or Br functionalization at different positions to induce various degrees of asymmetry in their structures. The photophysical and electrochemical properties of these molecules were studied, and their packing patterns were analysed. The OFETs based on these materials were fabricated through simple spin&#8208;coating method, and the as&#8208;resulted thin films were treated with different conditions. The devices exhibit typical n&#8208;type performances under ambient conditions with charge carrier mobilities up to 4.27&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. The crystallinities and morphologies of these thin films were studied to investigate the correlations between the device performances and thin&#8208;film characteristics. Our study suggests that phenanthrene conjugated N&#8208;heteroacenes can be developed as promising air&#8208;stable solution&#8208;processable n&#8208;type semiconducting materials, and Br modification at certain positions of phenanthrene is beneficial in adjusting the thin&#8208;film properties for the improvement of OFET performances.

         <title>Free&#8208;Standing Nanocomposite Au@Graphene Oxide Continuous Flow Synthesis in Water for Degradation of Organic Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Free&#8208;standing gold nanoparticle decorated graphene oxide (Au@GO) rapidly forms in aqueous auric acid under continuous flow using a vortex fluidic device (VFD), as a photo&#8208;contact electrification process in the rapidly rotating tilted VFD tube under 254&#8197;nm UV irradiation, with Au@GO rapidly catalysing the degradation of organic dyes by excess in&#8197;situ generated hydrogen peroxide.







Abstract
We have developed a rapid and facile method for preparing free&#8208;standing nanocomposite of gold nanoparticles with graphene oxide (Au@GO) in water under continuous flow in the absence of harsh reducing agents and any other auxiliary substances, as a method with favourable green chemistry metrics. This uses a vortex fluidic device (VFD) where induced mechanical energy and photo&#8208;contact electrification associated with the dynamic thin film in the rapidly rotating tube tilted at 45&#176; while simultaneously UV irradiated (&#955;=254&#8197;nm, 20&#8197;W) results in decomposition of water to hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide with growth of the gold nanoparticles on the surface of the GO. We have established that the resulting Au@GO composite sheets rapidly catalyse the degradation of commercial dyes like methyl orange (MO) and methylene blue (MB) using the hydrogen peroxide generated in&#8197;situ in the VFD. This process relies on active radicals generated through liquid&#8208;solid photo&#8208;contact electrification of water in the VFD which dramatically minimises the generation of waste in industrial applications, with the reaction having implications for wastewater treatment.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zinc&#8208;ion batteries have emerged as strong candidates for replacing Li/Na&#8208;ion batteries owing to their high safety and environmental friendliness. However, the large electrostatic repulsion between the cathode and Zn2+, the irreversible growth of zinc dendrites at the anode, and the hydrogen precipitation side reaction in the aqueous electrolyte have hindered the practical application of zinc ion batteries. Fortunately, the emergence of the revolutionary concept of high entropy has provided new opportunities for the development of battery materials. High&#8208;entropy materials, with their unique atomic structures and uniform distribution of multiple elements, offer flexible options for material compositions and electronic structures, thus attracting significant attention in battery systems. In this concept article, we summarize the definitions and intrinsic structural characteristics of high&#8208;entropy materials and provide a detailed overview of the latest design concepts from the perspectives of cathodes, anodes, and electrolytes. Finally, we outline the challenges faced by high&#8208;entropy materials and potential solutions to guide researchers in developing efficient and stable zinc&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Chirality&#8208;Dependent Anisotropic Nonlinear Optical Effect in Low&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Metal Halides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low&#8208;dimensional hybrid metal halides (LDHMHs) have emerged as a highly promising class of functional materials for a wide range of optoelectronic applications. Their exceptional structural tunability, facilitated by the hybridization of metal halides with organic compounds, enables the formation of three&#8208;, two&#8208;, one&#8208;, or zero&#8208;dimensional structures. This flexibility in structural design also allows the incorporation of chirality into the crystalline lattice, giving rise to novel LDHMH materials that are capable of selectively interacting with the spin angular momentum of electrons and photons. Among the unique optoelectronic properties of LDHMHs, the focus of this concept article is their chiroptical nonlinear optical (NLO) effect. LDHMHs demonstrate a highly effective discrimination and generation of circularly polarized (CP) light in the NLO regime, particularly in the second harmonic generation (SHG) process, referred to as SHG&#8208;circular dichroism (SHG&#8208;CD) and CP&#8208;SHG. These anisotropic responses are several orders of magnitude larger than linear chiroptical responses, such as CD and CP luminescence; consequently, LDHMHs are expected to be promising candidates for future optical&#8208;information devices and encryption systems. This article introduces recently reported chiral LDHMH materials that exhibit excellent CP&#8208;dependent anisotropic SHG responses.</dc:description>

         <title>Confinement Effects of Coordination Cages on the Synthesis and Application of Polyoxometalates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The confinement effects within coordination cages present powerful tools in modern chemistry, particularly for the synthesis and manipulation of complex molecules. This concept article reviews the use of coordination cages to stabilize and tune the properties of polyoxometalates (POMs), a class of nano&#8208;sized metallic clusters, expanding the focus beyond traditional organic reactions. The article provides a brief overview of coordination cages, and POM chemistry and discusses the encapsulation of POMs in coordination cages, highlighting how these cages provide a confinement effect that enhances the stability and reactivity of POMs. Additionally, the concept of cavity&#8208;directed synthesis is explored as a method for creating labile POMs, which are often unstable in aqueous conditions, underlining its implications for supramolecular catalysis. Future research will focus on expanding the structures and applications of encapsulated POMs, as well as improving cage designs to unlock new cluster architectures.</dc:description>

         <title>Intermolecular Forces&#8208;oriented Growth of MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Well&#8208;controlled conjugation of distinct metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with dissimilar components and structures into a multi&#8208;component MOF system is important for the design of myriad materials with structural complexity, integrated properties, and desired applications. Herein, we developed an interesting integration strategy that relies on intermolecular force, and which can overcome the difference in lattice parameters. The strategy uses the pre&#8208;formed MOF matrixes as seeds to direct the self&#8208;assembly of secondary MOF particles for the construction of hybrid MOFs. As a proof of concept, the representative core&#8208;satellite&#8208;type Ni&#8208;MOF@ZIF&#8208;8 and core&#8208;shell&#8208;type MOF&#8208;74@ZIF&#8208;8 heterostructures were achieved. Theory calculations elucidate the uncommon formation of well&#8208;defined hybrid MOFs by self&#8208;assembly of secondary ZIF&#8208;8 particles to anchor on Ni&#8208;MOF or MOF&#8208;74 seed surface via hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions. We anticipate that this work opens an avenue to design the multi&#8208;component MOF systems from different MOFs with lattice mismatching.</dc:description>

         <title>Triskelion&#8208;shaped Hexabenzocoronenes: Synthesis and Characterization of tris&#8208;substituted HBC derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of unprecedented triskelion&#8208;shaped hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenes with C3, C3h or D3h symmertry is reported. We present a new, five step synthetic access to tris&#8208;iodinated HBC derivatives carrying different solubilizing moieties (tert&#8208;butyl and mesityl), which serve as suitable building blocks for further functionalization. These molecules can undergo Sonogashira cross coupling reactions to obtain a series of seven ethynyl tris&#8208;substituted HBCs. The coupling partners range from carbon&#8208;based aromatic scaffolds (tBu&#8208;benzene, naphthalene, phenanthrene) to ligands for metal complexes (bipyridine, phenanthroline, terpyridine, acetylacetone). The optoelectronic properties were investigated by UV/vis absorption spectroscopy resulting in a significant batho&#8208;chromic shift of the absorption maximum compared to the iodinated starting material. Semiempirical calculations were used to determine the conformation and symmetry of the compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in DNA&#8208;Based Nanoprobes for In vivo MiRNA Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 66, November 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept review summarizes signal amplification strategies including DNAzyme catalytic reaction, hybrid chain reaction (HCR), catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) to enhance detection signal of lowly expressed miRNAs; external stimuli and internal stimuli to prevent nonspecific activation; and the development of NIR&#8208;II fluorescent probes for in&#8197;vivo miRNA imaging and indicated current challenges for in&#8197;vivo miRNA imaging.







Abstract
As a post transcriptional regulator of gene expression, microRNAs (miRNA) is closely related to many major human diseases, especially cancer. Therefore, its precise detection is very important for disease diagnosis and treatment. With the advancement of fluorescent dye and imaging technology, the focus has shifted from in&#8197;vitro miRNA detection to in&#8197;vivo miRNA imaging. This concept review summarizes signal amplification strategies including DNAzyme catalytic reaction, hybrid chain reaction (HCR), catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) to enhance detection signal of lowly expressed miRNAs; external stimuli of ultraviolet (UV) light or near&#8208;infrared region (NIR) light, and internal stimuli such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), glutathione (GSH), protease and cell membrane protein to prevent nonspecific activation for the avoidance of false positive signal; and the development of fluorescent probes with emission in NIR for in&#8197;vivo miRNA imaging; as well as rare earth nanoparticle based the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) nanoprobes with excellent tissue penetration and depth for in&#8197;vivo miRNA imaging. The concept review also indicated current challenges for in&#8197;vivo miRNA imaging including the dynamic monitoring of miRNA expression change and simultaneous in&#8197;vivo imaging of multiple miRNAs.

         <title>Achieving Regioselectivity for Remote C&#8722;H Activation by Substructure Conformations: an Approach of Paralogous Cytochrome P450 Enzymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 66, November 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling regioselectivity in C&#8722;H activation is challenging, particularly for complex substrates. Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs) offer a solution by modulating distance and geometry between the reaction center and target site. Comparative studies on homologous CYPs, such as IkaD and CftA, reveal that distinct substructure conformations can influence regioselectivity and have implications for CYP engineering.







Abstract
For advanced synthetic intermediates or natural products with multiple unactivated and energetically similar C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds, controlling regioselectivity for the C&#8722;H activation is particularly challenging. The use of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) is a promising solution to the &#8216;regioelectivity&#8217; challenge in remote C&#8722;H activation. Notably, CYPs and organic catalysts share a fundamental principle: they strive to control the distance and geometry between the metal reaction center and the target C&#8722;H site. Most structural analyses of the regioselectivity of CYPs are limited to the active pocket, particularly when explaining why regioselectivity could be altered by enzyme engineering through mutagenesis. However, the substructures responsible for forming the active pocket in CYPs are well known to display complex dynamic changes and substrate&#8208;induced plasticity. In this context, we highlight a comparative study of the recently reported paralogous CYPs, IkaD and CftA, which achieve different regioselectivity towards the same substrate ikarugamycin by distinct substructure conformations. We propose that substructural conformation&#8208;controlled regioselectivity might also be present in CYPs of other natural product biosynthesis pathways, which should be considered when engineering CYPs for regioselective modifications.

&lt;p&gt;Controlling regioselectivity in C&#8722;H activation is challenging, particularly for complex substrates. Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs) offer a solution by modulating distance and geometry between the reaction center and target site. Comparative studies on homologous CYPs, such as IkaD and CftA, reveal that distinct substructure conformations can influence regioselectivity and have implications for CYP engineering.

         <title>Probing Noncovalent Interaction Strengths of Host&#8208;Guest Complexes Using Negative Ion Photoelectron Spectroscopy</title>

         <dc:description>
Noncovalent interactions (NCIs) are the driving forces for the formation and stability of host&#8208;guest complexes that ubiquitously exist in fields as diverse of biology, chemistry, materials sciences, pharmaceuticals, and environmental ion separations. Now the absolute interaction strength of NCIs can be directly and precisely measured by gas&#8208;phase electrospray ionization negative ion photoelectron spectroscopy.







Abstract
Noncovalent interactions (NCIs) are crucial for the formation and stability of host&#8208;guest complexes, which have wide&#8208;ranging implications across various fields, including biology, chemistry, materials science, pharmaceuticals, and environmental science. However, since NCIs are relatively weak and sensitive to bulk perturbation, direct and accurate measurement of their absolute strength has always been a significant challenge. This concept article aims to demonstrate the gas&#8208;phase electrospray ionization (ESI)&#8208;negative ion photoelectron spectroscopy (NIPES) as a direct and precise technique to measure the absolute interaction strength, probe nature of NCIs, and reveal the electronic structural information for host&#8208;guest complexes. Our recent studies in investigating various host&#8208;guest complexes that involve various types of NCIs such as anion&#8211;&#960;, (di)hydrogen bonding, charge&#8208;separated ionic interactions, are overviewed. Finally, a summary and outlook are provided for this field.

         <title>Uncovering the Potent Antiviral Activity of the Sesterterpenoids from the Sponge Ircinia Felix Against Human Adenoviruses: from the Natural Source to the Total Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 66, November 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isolation, structure elucidation, biological activity, and total synthesis of ircinialactam J, a novel sesterterpene lactam produced by the sponge Ircinia felix, is presented. Ircinialactam J displays a significant antiviral activity against Human Adenoviruses (11 times more active than cidofovir&#174;) without cytotoxicity. This work reports the first synthesis of a lactamic sesterterpene.







Abstract
Human Adenovirus (HAdV) infections in immunocompromised patients can result in disseminated diseases with high morbidity and mortality rates due to the absence of available treatments for these infections. The sponge Ircinia felix was selected for the significant anti&#8208;HAdV activity displayed by its organic extracts. Its chemical analysis yielded three novel sesterterpene lactams, ircinialactams J&#8722;L, along with three known sesterterpene furans which structures were established by a deep spectrometric analysis. Ircinialactam J displayed significant antiviral activity against HAdV without significant cytotoxicity, showing an effectiveness 11 times greater than that of the standard treatment, cidofovir&#174;. Comparison of the antiviral evaluation results of the isolated compounds allowed us to deduce some structure&#8208;activity relationships. Mechanistic assays suggest that ircinialactam J targets an early step of the HAdV replicative cycle before HAdV genome reaches the nucleus of the host cell. The first total synthesis of ircinialactam J was also accomplished to prove the structure and to provide access to analogues. Key steps are a regio&#8208; and stereoselective construction of the trisubstituted Z&#8208;olefin at &#916;7 by iron&#8208;catalyzed carbometallation of a homopropargylic alcohol, a stereoselective methylation to generate the stereogenic center at C18, and the formation of the (Z)&#8208;&#916;20 by stereoselective aldol condensation to introduce the tetronic acid unit. Ircinialactam J is a promising chemical lead to new potent antiviral drugs against HAdV infections.

         <title>Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction Mechanisms of La@C60 and Gd@C60 Studied Using Density Functional Theory</title>

Improving the understanding of fullerene reactivity through calculation. DFT calculations reproduce and rationalize the behaviour of endohedral fullerenes containing lanthanum of gadolinium centers, either in cationic or neutral form, towards Diels&#8208;Alder reactions. These results can be extrapolated to the reactivity of other endohedral fullerenes with other dienes.







Abstract
Encapsulation of transition metals represents a crucial method for modifying the electronic structure and regulating the reactivity of fullerene, thereby expanding its applications. Herein, we present calculations with density functional theory methods to investigate the mechanisms of the Diels&#8208;Alder (DA) reactions of cyclopentadiene and La@C60 or Gd@C60 as well as their tricationic derivatives. Our findings indicate that the encapsulation of La and Gd into the C60 cage is thermodynamically favorable. The DA reactions are favored by the presence of La and Gd, with lower barriers, though the regioselectivity, favoring 6&#8722;6 bonds in the fullerene, is not affected. The effect of external electric fields has been also considered.

         <title>Urea Ligand&#8208;Promoted Chainwalking Heteroannulation for the Synthesis of 6&#8208; and 7&#8208;membered Azaheterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 66, November 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Urea ligands promote chainwalking heteroannulation reactions for the synthesis of 6&#8208; and 7&#8208;membered azaheterocycles from a common set of precursors. In this reaction, ureas outperform established ligands for Pd&#8208;catalyzed chainwalking processes, particularly for more challenging substrates such as 1,5&#8208;dienes.







Abstract
Typical approaches to heterocycle construction require significant changes in synthetic strategy even for a change as minor as increasing the ring size. The ability to access multiple heterocyclic scaffolds through a common synthetic approach, simply through trivial modification of one reaction component, would enable facile access to diverse libraries of structural analogues of core scaffolds. Here, we show that urea&#8208;derived ligands effectively promote Pd&#8208;mediated chainwalking processes to enable remote heteroannulation for the rapid construction of six&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered azaheterocycles under essentially identical reaction conditions. This method demonstrates good functional group tolerance and effectively engages sterically hindered substrates. In addition, this reaction is applicable to target&#8208;oriented synthesis, demonstrated through the formal synthesis of antimalarial alkaloid galipinine.

         <title>What is the Origin of the Regioselective C3&#8208;Hydroxylation of L&#8208;Arg by the Nonheme Iron Enzyme Capreomycin C?</title>

A computational study on the nonheme iron dioxygenase CmnC highlights the origin of the regioselectivity of L&#8208;Arg hydroxylation step as the result of substrate binding and positioning by polar residues in the substrate binding pocket.







Abstract
The nonheme iron dioxygenase capreomycin C (CmnC) hydroxylates a free L&#8208;arginine amino acid regio&#8208; and stereospecifically at the C3&#8208;position as part of the capreomycin antibiotics biosynthesis. Little is known on its structure, catalytic cycle and substrate specificity and, therefore, a comprehensive computational study was performed. A large QM cluster model of CmnC was created of 297 atoms and the mechanisms for C3&#8722;H, C4&#8722;H and C5&#8722;H hydroxylation and C3&#8722;C4 desaturation were investigated. All low&#8208;energy pathways correspond to radical reaction mechanisms with an initial hydrogen atom abstraction followed by OH rebound to form alcohol product complexes. The work is compared to alternative L&#8208;Arg hydroxylating nonheme iron dioxygenases and the differences in active site polarity are compared. We show that a tight hydrogen bonding network in the substrate binding pocket positions the substrate in an ideal orientation for C3&#8722;H activation, whereby the polar groups in the substrate binding pocket induce an electric field effect that guides the selectivity.

         <title>Orthogonal Geometry Enhancing the Intersystem Crossing and Photosensitive Efficiency of Spiro Organoboron Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 66, November 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations are conducted to investigate the potential photosensitivity of spiro organoboron compounds. Geometric analysis reveals that the configuration of S1 determines the molecular ISC rate constants, and PSs with a (N, N) acceptor exhibit higher theoretical sensitization efficiency than those with a (N, O) acceptor, which is contributed by the donor&#8208;acceptor orthogonal feature.







Abstract
Based on the reported spiro organoboron compounds (PS1 and PS2 as potent 1O2 sensitizers), several new organoboron molecules (PS4&#8211;PS9) were constructed through structural modification, and their low&#8208;lying excited states and photophysical properties have been explored by density functional theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent DFT (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations. The predicted effective intersystem crossing (ISC) processes arise from the S1&#8594;T2 transition for PS4&#8211;PS6 and the S1&#8594;T4 transition for PS1, and corresponding KISC rate constants reach the order of magnitude of 109 (s&#8722;1). The organoboron compounds with a (N, N) chelate acceptor are predicted to exhibit relatively higher ISC efficiency than those bearing a (N, O) acceptor, and the planar C3NBN ring and the orthogonal configuration between the donor and acceptor moieties are responsible for the ISC rate enhancement. Importantly, the geometric features of the lowest singlet excited state (S1) for these compounds play a decisive role in their photosensitive efficiency. The present results provide a basis for better understanding of the photosensitivity of these spiro organoboron compounds and the structural modification effect.

         <title>Access to Diverse Carbonyl Compounds by Catalyst&#8208;Free and Photoinduced Aerobic Cleavage of C=N Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 66, November 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalyst&#8208;free and photoinduced aerobic cleavage of C=N bonds has been developed using oxygen from air as green oxidant. This strategy features broad substrate scope and a series of carbonyl compounds including ketones, aldehydes, carboxylic acids and relative drug analogues were obtained. Moreover, the easy&#8208;operation and gram&#8208;scale synthesis indicates the practicality of this method.







Abstract
Functional group interconversion is of great significance in organic synthesis. However, aerobic cleavage of C=N bonds to access carbonyl compounds still suffered from some limitations such as harsh reaction conditions, stoichiometric oxidants, poor substrate scope and use of toxic reagents. Herein, we report a catalyst&#8208;free and photo&#8208;induced aerobic cleavage of C=N bonds to afford diverse carbonyl compounds using oxygen from air as green oxidant. This mild methodology permits N&#8208;tosylhydrazones converted into the corresponding carbonyl compounds including ketones, aldehydes and carboxylic acids, showing broad functional group tolerance and compatibility. Moreover, the gram&#8208;scale reaction and post&#8208;modification of complicated molecules proved the applicability and efficiency of this strategy. Finally, a plausible mechanism was proposed based on spectroscopic investigations and detailed mechanistic studies.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 66, November 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study examines &#945;&#8208;Bi2Mo3O12 (BMO) in different forms as a dual&#8208;functional material for water splitting and supercapacitor applications. BMO (AC) and BMO (BC) show superior electrocatalytic activity, while BMO (BE) excels in supercapacitors.







Abstract
This study explores the functionality of &#945;&#8208;Bi2Mo3O12 (BMO) as an electrocatalyst for water splitting and its suitability for supercapacitor applications. BMO was synthesized by the solvothermal method and characterized in pre&#8208;calcination [BMO (BC)], post&#8208;calcination [BMO (AC)], and base&#8208;etched forms [BMO (BE)]. Structural analysis confirmed the formation of &#945;&#8208;Bi2Mo3O12 with well&#8208;defined crystallographic planes. Electrochemical analysis revealed that BMO (AC) exhibited the lowest overpotential for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) and BMO (BC) exhibited the lowest overpotential for oxygen evolution reactions (OER), indicating its superior electrocatalytic activity. The Tafel slope and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results confirmed the superior kinetics and charge transfer properties of BMO material. Furthermore, BMO samples demonstrated excellent stability during prolonged chronoamperometry (CA) testing for 12&#8197;h. For supercapacitor performances, the BMO (BE) exhibits a superior specific capacitance value of 398&#8197;F/g at 2.0&#8197;A/g. Thus, the BMO material delivers prominent electrocatalytic activity as well as supercapacitor performance. Overall, this study demonstrates the potentiality of &#945;&#8208;Bi2Mo3O12 in different forms as a dual&#8208;functional material for efficient energy storage and conversion.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Quantum Coherence of Reversible Photo&#8208;Generated Radical and its Film</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 66, November 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reversible photogenerated radicals 2,4,6&#8208;Tri(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (tpt) show a temperature&#8208;independent quantum coherence with Tm=1.1&#8197;&#956;s at 20&#8211;300&#8197;K and the Tm of tpt&#8208;film increased by two times at low temperature.







Abstract
Electron spin qubits are becoming an important research direction in the field of quantum computing and information storage.

&lt;p&gt;Electron spin qubits are becoming an important research direction in the field of quantum computing and information storage. However, the quantum decoherence has seriously hindered the development of this field. So far, few qubits exhibit long phase memory time (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>Photoinduced Deoxygenative C2 Arylation of Quinoline N&#8208;oxides with Phenylhydrazines to 2&#8208;Arylquinolines over Porous Tubular Graphitic Carbon Nitride Semiconductor Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 66, November 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using porous tubular graphitic carbon nitride (PTCN) as recyclable heterogeneous catalyst and arylhydrazines as cheap and commercially available arylation reagent, a novel photoinduced deoxygenative C2 arylation of quinoline N&#8208;oxides to 2&#8208;arylquinolines was developed successfully.







Abstract
The photo&#8208;induced deoxygenative C2 arylation of quinoline N&#8208;oxides to 2&#8208;arylquinolines is achieved over a heterogeneous porous tubular graphitic carbon nitride (PTCN) catalyst with phenylhydrazines as arylation reagent. A wide range of quinoline N&#8208;oxides can be efficiently transformed into their corresponding 2&#8208;arylquinolines under visible light irradiation. Moreover, PTCN catalyst is easily separated and could be reused several times without loss to its original activity.

         <title>Electrodeposition and Optimisation of Amorphous NixSy Catalyst for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction in Alkaline Environment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 66, November 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports the optimisation of nickel sulfide&#8208;based catalyst prepared via electrodeposition process. Thiourea concentration and current density for deposition are the most influential factors. The optimised NixSy catalyst shows excellent performance in an anion exchange membrane water electrolyser, achieving 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a cell voltage of 1.88&#8197;V under 333&#8197;K in 1&#8197;M KOH.







Abstract
Anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolysers have shown their potential in green hydrogen production. One of the crucial tasks is to discover novel cost&#8208;effective and sustainable electrocatalyst materials. In this study, a low&#8208;cost Ni&#8722;S&#8208;based catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction was prepared via a simple electrodeposition process from a modified Watts bath recipe. Physical characterisation methods suggest this deposit film to be amorphous. Optimisation of the electrodeposition parameters of the NixSy catalyst was carried out using a rotating disk electrode setup. The optimised catalyst exhibited excellent catalytical performance in 1&#8197;M KOH on a microelectrode, with overpotentials of 41&#8197;mV, 111&#8197;mV and 202&#8197;mV at 10, 100 and 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with Tafel slope of 67.9&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 recorded at 333&#8197;K. Long&#8208;term testing of the catalyst demonstrated steady performance over a 24&#8197;h period on microelectrode at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with only 71&#8197;mV and 37&#8197;mV overpotential increase at 293&#8197;K and 333&#8197;K respectively. Full cell testing with the optimised NixSy as cathode and NiFe(OH)2 as anode showed 1.88&#8197;V after 1&#8197;h electrolysis at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 1&#8197;M KOH under 333&#8197;K with FAA&#8208;3&#8208;30 membrane.

         <title>Migration of para&#8208;Nitrophenyl Groups in Methyl Pyranosides: Configuration and Conformation Determine the Kinetics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 66, November 26, 2024. </description>

Surprising complexity. O&#8208;Aryl migration in carbohydrates under basic Zempl&#233;n conditions (NaOMe in MeOH) was investigated employing a library of para&#8208;nitrophenyl&#8208;substituted methyl pyranosides. Rate constants and activation energies as obtained from extensive NMR measurements revealed clear migration trends, which could be related to configurational and conformational characteristics. Theoretical chemistry shows the complexity of this seemingly simple reaction.







Abstract
para&#8208;Nitrophenyl (PNP) ethers of glycosides are important building blocks en route to functional carbohydrates. They are stable in neutral media, however, under basic conditions such as during the Zempl&#233;n deacylation of sugars, aryl migration is frequently observed. We have employed a library of O&#8208;PNP&#8208;substituted methyl glycosides of the manno&#8208;, galacto&#8208;, gluco&#8208; and altro&#8208;series to study the kinetics of aryl migration in MeOH/sodium methoxide using NMR spectroscopy revealing that migration between cis&#8208;oriented OH groups is faster than between trans&#8208;oriented ones. The rate constants of migration decrease in the order of Alt&gt;Man&gt;Gal&gt;Glc and are related to the energy barriers of chair conformation inversion. The energy profile of the 3 to 4&#8208;PNP migration in methyl mannoside was calculated using DFT methods suggesting the Meisenheimer complex is an intermediate of PNP migration and that coordination of the sodium cation has a major impact on the energy profile.

         <title>Luminescence Changeable CO2&#8208;Storage Cylinder: Triple&#8208;Stranded Helical Eu(III)/Tb(III) Fluorinated MOFs with Amide Linkers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 66, November 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel lanthanide MOFs with CO2 gas adsorption are demonstrated. The MOFs constructed a cylindrical structure. The inner channel of the cylindrical structure was covered with fluorine atoms. The fluorine atoms enhance interaction with CO2 gas molecules. Eu/Tb&#8208;mixed MOFs exhibited the change of ratiometric emission intensity between Eu and Tb by CO2 gas adsorption behavior.







Abstract
Triple&#8208;stranded helical lanthanide MOFs with CO2 adsorption properties were investigated. Lanthanide MOFs ([Eu0.1Tb0.9(hfa)3(dpa)]n) are composed of lanthanide luminophores (Eu(III) and/or Tb(III) ions), fluorinated antenna ligands (hfa: hexafluoroacetylacetonate), and polyamide&#8208;type linker ligands (dpa: 4&#8208;(diphenylphosphoryl)&#8208;N&#8208;(4&#8208;(diphenylphosphoryl)phenyl)benzamide). The cylindrical structure was characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis, thermogravimetric analysis, and gas adsorption measurements. The inner surfaces of the cylindrical channels were covered with the fluorine atoms of the hfa ligands. The emission intensity ratio (IEu/ITb) in [Eu0.1Tb0.9(hfa)3(dpa)]n is affected by the CO2 gas adsorption behavior. The change in IEu/ITb value was caused by the intermolecular interactions between the CO2 gas molecules and the fluorinated ligands, resulting in an electronic structural change of the lowest triplet excited state in the photosensitized hfa ligands.

&lt;p&gt;Novel lanthanide MOFs with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas adsorption are demonstrated. The MOFs constructed a cylindrical structure. The inner channel of the cylindrical structure was covered with fluorine atoms. The fluorine atoms enhance interaction with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas molecules. Eu/Tb-mixed MOFs exhibited the change of ratiometric emission intensity between Eu and Tb by CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas adsorption behavior.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Triple-stranded helical lanthanide MOFs with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption properties were investigated. Lanthanide MOFs ([Eu&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Tb&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;(hfa)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(dpa)]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) are composed of lanthanide luminophores (Eu(III) and/or Tb(III) ions), fluorinated antenna ligands (hfa: hexafluoroacetylacetonate), and polyamide-type linker ligands (dpa: 4-(diphenylphosphoryl)-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-(4-(diphenylphosphoryl)phenyl)benzamide). The cylindrical structure was characterized by single-crystal X-ray analysis, thermogravimetric analysis, and gas adsorption measurements. The inner surfaces of the cylindrical channels were covered with the fluorine atoms of the hfa ligands. The emission intensity ratio (&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;Eu&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;Tb&lt;/sub&gt;) in [Eu&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Tb&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;(hfa)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(dpa)]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is affected by the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas adsorption behavior. The change in &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;Eu&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;Tb&lt;/sub&gt; value was caused by the intermolecular interactions between the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas molecules and the fluorinated ligands, resulting in an electronic structural change of the lowest triplet excited state in the photosensitized hfa ligands.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aromaticity in Isoelectronic Analogues of Benzene, Carborazine and Borazine, from Electronic Structure and Magnetic Property</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 66, November 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic structures and magnetic properties of carborazine and borazine were theoretically studied and compared with those of benzene. It was confirmed that carborazine is evidently aromatic, while borazine only exhibits rather weak aromaticity. The C atom between B and N atoms in carborazine behaves as a conjugated bridge, which is the essence of the distinctly different aromaticity between the isoelectronic analogues of benzene.







Abstract
Carborazine (B2C2N2H6) and borazine (B3N3H6) are isoelectronic analogues of benzene (C6H6). The aromatic character of borazine have basically reached a consensus after a long period of controversy, but the related properties of carborazine are even rarely reported. In this work, we systematically investigated the geometric structure, charge distribution, frontier molecular orbital characteristics, bonding, electronic delocalization, magnetic shielding effect, and induced ring current of carborazine and borazine, and compared the studied characteristics with those of benzene to determine the aromatic character of the two analogues. The combination of multiple properties shows that although they are isoelectronic, carborazine is evidently aromatic, while borazine only exhibits rather weak aromaticity. The C atom acting as a connecting bridge between B and N atoms in carborazine reduces the electronegativity difference on the molecular backbone and enhances the electronic delocalization over the conjugated path, which is the essence of the distinct disparity of aromaticity between carborazine and borazine.

         <title>Constructing Cyclic Hydrogen Bonding to Suppress Side Reactions and Dendrite Formation on Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 66, November 26, 2024. </description>

N&#8208;hydroxymethylacetamide additives in 2&#8197;M ZnSO4 electrolytes disrupt water molecule networks, inhibiting dendrite growth and improving zinc anode stability, while guiding uniform zinc deposition, significantly enhancing battery cycle life and Coulombic efficiency. This work underscores the potential of electrolyte additives to address critical limitations in zinc metal batteries.







Abstract
The high electrochemical reactivity of H2O molecules and zinc metal results in severe side reactions and dendrite formation on zinc anodes. Here we demonstrate that these issues can be addressed by using N&#8208;hydroxymethylacetamide (NHA) as additives in 2&#8197;M ZnSO4 electrolytes. The addition of NHA molecules, acting as both a hydrogen bond donor and acceptor, enables the formation of cyclic hydrogen bonding with H2O molecules. This interaction disrupts the existing hydrogen bonding networks between H2O molecules, hindering proton transport, and containing H2O molecules within the cyclic hydrogen bonding structure to prevent deprotonation. Additionally, NHA molecules show a preference for adsorption on the (101) crystal surface of zinc metal. This preferential adsorption reduces the surface energy of the (101) plane, facilitating the homogeneous Zn deposition along the (101) direction. Thus, the NHA enables Zn||Zn symmetric cell with a cycle lifespan of 1100&#8197;hours at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and Zn||Cu asymmetric cell with a high Coulombic efficiency over 99.5&#8201;%. Moreover, the NHA&#8208;modified Zn||AC zinc ion hybrid capacitor is capable of sustaining 15000 cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. This electrolyte additive engineering presents a promising strategy to enhance the performance and broaden the application potential of zinc metal&#8208;based energy storage devices.

         <title>Regulating the Topologies and Photoresponsive Properties of Lanthanum&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 66, November 26, 2024. </description>

Two lanthanum&#8208;organic frameworks with dinuclear lanthanum as building blocks and distinct bipyridinedicarboxylate as likers are prepared. Their structural differences result in the diversities of photoresponsive functionalities in terms of photochromism, photomodulated fluorescence and proton conductivity.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) show potential application in many domains, in which photochromic MOFs (PMOFs) have received enormous attention. Researchers mainly utilize photoactive ligands to build PMOFs. Recently, the mixed electron donating and accepting ligands strategies have also been used to construct PMOFs driven by the electron transfer between nonphotochromic moieties. However, the potential interligand competition inhibits the formation of PMOFs. Therefore, the exploration of single&#8208;ligand&#8208;guided assembly is conductive for building PMOFs. Considering the existing electron accepting and donating role of pyridyl and carboxyl, the pyridinecarboxyate derived from the fusion of pyridyl and carboxyl units may serve as single ligand to yield PMOFs (Figure&#8197;1d). In this work, the coordination assembly of bipyridinedicarboxylate (2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylic acid, H2bpdc; 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline&#8208;2,9&#8208;dicarboxylic acid, H2pda) and LaCl3 generate two PMOFs, [La(bpdc)(H2O)Cl] (1) and [La(pda)(H2O)2Cl]&#8901;2H2O (2). Both complexes feature dinuclear lanthanum as building blocks with differences in the connecting number of likers, in which 1 has (4,8)&#8208;connected topology and 2 exhibits sql topology. Their structural differences result in the diversities of photoresponsive functionalities. Compared with reported PMOFs built from photoactive ligands and mixed ligands, this study provides new available categories of single ligand for generating PMOFs and tuning the structure and photoresponsive properties via ligand substitution and external photostimulus.

         <dc:description>
The Front Cover illustrates adsorption of the CO2 molecule into the inner channel of luminescent EuIII/TbIII fluorinated metal&#8211;organic frameworks. These MOFs form a cylindrical structure composed of triple&#8208;stranded helical chains. This characteristic cylindrical structure selectively adsorbs CO2, but not N2. The intensity ratio between red&#8208;emitting EuIII and green&#8208;emitting TbIII is dependent on the gas adsorption. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y. Hasegawa and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202403224).

These MOFs form a cylindrical structure composed of triple-stranded helical chains. This characteristic cylindrical structure selectively adsorbs CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, but not N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The intensity ratio between red-emitting Eu&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; and green-emitting Tb&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; is dependent on the gas adsorption.

Carborazine (B2C2N2H6) and borazine (B3N3H6) are isoelectronic analogues of benzene (C6H6). In this work, we systematically investigated the geometric structure, charge distribution, frontier molecular orbital characteristics, bonding, electronic delocalization, magnetic shielding effect, and induced ring current of carborazine and borazine, and compared the studied characteristics with those of benzene to determine the aromatic character of the two analogues. More information can be found in the Research Article by Z. Liu, T. Lu and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202403369).

         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature shows a race between different sugars in which a para&#8208;nitrophenyl (PNP) substituent must be transferred from the start to the finish line. The rate constants of the substituents&#8242; migration are represented by animals (and a stone). The track itself has a bump that represents the energy barrier of the migration. Thus, the cover sums up our work investigating PNP migration for different sugars, which yielded the rate constants and energy barriers. We also performed theoretical studies on the mechanism and its energetic profile. More information can be found in the Research Article by L.&#8197;M. Friedrich, C. L&#252;tjohann, B. Hartke and T.&#8197;K. Lindhorst (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202403117).

         <title>Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Reaction: Comprehensive Strategic Approaches to Catalyst Design for Selective Liquid Products Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 66, November 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical CO2 reduction presents a promising avenue for transforming CO2 molecules into value added liquid chemicals, such as methanol, ethanol, formate, acetate, oxalate, C3&#8208;C4 products: 1&#8208;propanol, 2&#8208;propanol, 1&#8208;butanol, methylglyoxal, ethyl glycol, 2,3&#8208;furandiol etc. This review aims to focus on the fundamental principles guiding the pre&#8208;determining factors behind catalyst designing principles for the conversion of CO2 into liquid products.







Abstract
The escalating concern regarding the release of CO2 into the atmosphere poses a significant threat to the contemporary efforts in mitigating climate change. Amidst a multitude of strategies for curtailing CO2 emissions, the electrochemical CO2 reduction presents a promising avenue for transforming CO2 molecules into a diverse array of valuable gaseous and liquid products, such as CO, CH3OH, CH4, HCO2H, C2H4, C2H5OH, CH3CO2H, 1&#8208;C3H7OH and others. The mechanistic investigations of gaseous products (e.&#8201;g. CO, CH4, C2H4, C2H6 and others) broadly covered in the literature. There is a noticeable gap in the literature when it comes to a comprehensive summary exclusively dedicated to coherent roadmap for the designing principles for a selective catalyst all possible liquid products (such as CH3OH, C2H5OH, 1&#8208;C3H7OH, 2&#8208;C3H7OH, 1&#8208;C4H9OH, as well as other C3&#8208;C4 products like methylglyoxal and 2,3&#8208;furandiol, in addition to HCO2H, AcOH, oxalic acid and others), selectively converted by CO2 reduction. This entails a meticulous analysis to justify these approaches and a thorough exploration of the correlation between materials and their electrocatalytic properties. Furthermore, these insightful discussions illuminate the future prospects for practical applications, a facet not exhaustively examined in prior reviews.

         <title>Research Progress on Ni&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts for the Electrochemical Reduction of Nitrogen to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 66, November 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nickel&#8208;based catalysts are particularly advantageous for electrochemical ammonia synthesis due to their low cost, high efficiency, and readily available resources. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the properties and catalytic mechanisms of various nickel&#8208;based catalysts employed in nitrogen reduction reactions. Furthermore, it explores future research directions for advancing nickel&#8208;based catalyst technologies.







Abstract
The electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) to synthesize ammonia (NH3) is considered as a promising method due to its approvable advantages of zero&#8208;pollution emission, feasible reaction proceedings, good safety and easy management. The multiple efforts have been devoted to the exploration of earth&#8208;abundant&#8208;element&#8208;based nanomaterials as high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts for realizing their industrial applications. Among these, the Ni&#8208;based nanomaterials is prioritized as an attractive non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal electrocatalysts for catalyzing NRR because they are earth&#8208;abundance and exceedingly easy to synthesize as well as also delivers the potential of high electrocatalytic activity and durability. In this review, after briefly elucidating the underlying mechanisms of NRR during the electrochemical process, we systematically sum up the recent research progress in representative Ni&#8208;based electrocatalysts, including monometallic Ni&#8208;based nanomaterials, bimetallic Ni&#8208;based nanomaterials, polymetallic Ni&#8208;based nanomaterials, etc. In particular, we discuss the effects of physicochemical properties, such as phases, crystallinity, morphology, composition, defects, heteroatom doping, and strain engineering, on the comprehensive performance of the abovementioned electrocatalysts, with the aim of establishing the nanostructure&#8208;function relationships of the electrocatalysts. In addition, the promising directions of Ni&#8208;based electrocatalysts for NRR are also pointed out and highlighted. The generic approach in this review may expand the frontiers of NRR and provides the inspiration for developing high&#8208;efficiently Ni&#8208;based electrocatalysts.

Carboxylic acids play an important role in organic synthesis, and electrochemical decarboxylation coupling is a very important way in the construction of chemical bonds such as C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;S, C&#8208;Halide, and C&#8722;B bonds. Here, we summarise a series of reactions using electrochemistry for decarboxylation coupling in recent years. Electrocatalysis is widely used in organic synthesis due to its green and efficient features, and electrochemical decarboxylation coupling is a very important way. Chemical bonds such as C&#8722;C, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;S, C&#8722;B, and C&#8722;Si have been successfully constructed using this method. This paper summarises the development of electrochemical decarboxylative coupling in recent years and gives an outlook for the future.







Abstract
Carboxylic acids are attractive synthetic feedstocks with stable, non&#8208;toxic, and inexpensive properties that can be easily obtained from natural sources or through synthesis. Carboxylic acids have long been considered environmentally friendly coupling agents in various organic transformations. In recent years, electrochemically mediated decarboxylation reactions of decarboxylic acids and their derivatives (NHPI) have emerged as effective new methods for constructing carbon&#8208;carbon or carbon&#8208;heterocarbon chemical bonds. Compared with transition metal and photochemistry&#8208;mediated catalytic reactions, which do not require the addition of oxidants and strong bases, electrochemically&#8208;mediated decarboxylative transformations are considered a sustainable strategy. In addition, various functional groups tolerate the electrochemical decarboxylation conversion strategy well. Here, we summarize the recent electrochemical decarboxylation reactions to better elucidate the advantages of electrochemical decarboxylation reactions.

         <dc:description>
Supramolecular hierarchical protein self&#8208;assembly is vital for constructing diverse and functional biomaterials, as well as to explore information exchange and cooperation between proteins. In this paper, the classical supramolecular protein assembly construction strategies and the flexible regulaion of assemblies are summarized and analyzed. In addition, the applications and the enormous potential and significance of supramolecular protein materials are also reviewed.







Abstract
Supramolecular chemistry achieves higher&#8208;order molecular self&#8208;assembly through non&#8208;covalent interactions. Utilizing supramolecular methods to explore the polymorphism of proteins, the building blocks of life, from a &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; perspective is essential for constructing diverse and functional biomaterials. In recent years, significant progress has been achieved in the design strategies and functional applications of supramolecular protein self&#8208;assembly, becoming a focal point for researchers. This paper reviews classical supramolecular strategies driving protein self&#8208;assembly, including electrostatic interactions, metal coordination, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, host&#8208;guest interactions, and other mechanisms. We discuss how these supramolecular interactions regulate protein assembly processes and highlight protein supramolecular assemblies&#8242; unique structural and functional advantages in constructing artificial photosynthetic systems, protein hydrogels, bio&#8208;delivery systems, and other functional materials. The enormous potential and significance of supramolecular protein materials are elucidated. Finally, the challenges in preparing and applying protein supramolecular assemblies are summarized, and future development directions are projected.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we report the design and synthesis of two novel carbazole&#8208;based bis&#8208;cyanostilbenes incorporating phenyl and thiophene &#960;&#8208;spacer units to investigate their distinct impacts on photophysical properties. Notably, the thiophene&#8208;based derivative exhibits remarkable far&#8208;red/near&#8208;infrared (NIR) solid&#8208;state emission, with an emission peak at 732 nm, which shifts to 750 nm upon mechanical grinding, demonstrating pronounced mechanochromic fluorescence in the NIR region. Although its quantum yield is moderate, the ability to modulate its emission through mechanical stimuli opens exciting opportunities for stimuli&#8208;responsive NIR applications. Conversely, the phenyl&#8208;based analogue shows excellent solid&#8208;state emission at 596 nm, achieving significantly higher quantum yields, due to suppressing &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions. Both compounds also exhibit strong AIE, with the thiophene system emitting at 730 nm and the phenyl&#8208;based analogue at 580 nm in the aggregate state. In addition to their optical properties, both derivatives demonstrate remarkable thermal stability and reversible MFC. These intriguing behaviors highlight the critical role of &#960;&#8208;spacer engineering in fine&#8208;tuning solid&#8208;state emission, enhancing stimuli&#8208;responsive capabilities, and ensuring robust thermal performance. Overall, our findings provide valuable insights into the design of next&#8208;generation NIR&#8208;emissive materials, with promising potential for advancing applications in optoelectronics, bioimaging, and smart sensing technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring glycan&#8208;lectin interactions in natural&#8208;like environments: A view using NMR experiments&#160;inside cell and on cell surface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycan&#8208;mediated molecular recognition events are essential for life. NMR is widely used to monitor glycan binding to&#160;lectins in solution&#160;using isolated glycans and lectins. In this context, we herein explore diverse NMR methodologies,&#160;from both the receptor and ligand perspectives,&#160;to monitor glycan&#8208;lectin interactions under experimental conditions mimicking the&#160;native milieu inside cells and on cell surface. For the NMR experiments inside cells, galectin&#8208;7 is employed as model, since most galectins are soluble and carry out their functions in the cellular micro&#8208;environment. Using&#160;Danio Rerio&#160;oocytes,&#160;the&#160;1H&#8208;15N HMQC&#160;NMR spectrum of a&#160;folded&#160;galectin has been observed inside cell for the first time,&#160;using a glycomimetic ligand (TDG) to&#160;overcoming the natural tendency of galectins to bind to numerous galactose&#8208;containing receptors within cells. Alternatively,most lectins, other than galectins, are displayed on the cell surface,&#160;providing a multivalent presentation to bind their glycan partners in&#160;cis&#160;(at the same cell) or in&#160;trans&#160;(on other cells).&#160;In this case,&#160;ligand&#8208;based&#160;STD&#8208;NMR experiments&#160;have been successfully applied to account for the interactions of natural glycans and glycomimetics with Siglec&#8208;10. These methodologies provide the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept to open the door to the NMR analysis of the recognition of glycans&#160;in native&#8208;like settings.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Organocatalysed Synthesis of (R)&#8208;Mandelic Acid Esters and &#945;&#8208;Alkoxy Derivatives from Commercial Sources</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A first catalytic one&#8208;pot chemical synthesis of optically active (R)&#8208;mandelic acids, esters and &#945;&#8208;alkoxy ester derivatives has been developed. The value&#8208;added final compounds have been obtained in high overall yield (26&#8211;94&#8201;%) and enantioselectivity (up to 97&#8201;% ee), through a straightforward route from commercially and widely available reagents, including aldehydes, water, alcohols and the organocatalyst.







Abstract
Optically active mandelic acid esters represent a highly valuable class of building blocks in organic synthesis and recurrent motifs embedded in bioactive compounds and drugs. Herein, we provide an enantioselective one&#8208;pot synthesis based on Knoevenagel condensation/asymmetric epoxidation/domino ring&#8208;opening hydrolysis (DROH) sequence to the crude mandelic acids, which underwent a final esterification step to (R)&#8208;methyl mandelates. These products have been obtained in good to high overall yield and enantioselectivity, using commercially and widely available reagents and catalyst including aldehydes, phenylsulfonyl acetonitrile, cumyl hydroperoxide, water and an epi&#8208;quinine&#8208;derived urea as the organocatalyst. Moreover, the versatility of the process has been demonstrated to prepare the corresponding &#945;&#8208;alkoxy esters in highly enantioselective manner, when using primary alcohols in a domino ring&#8208;opening esterification (DROE) step. This system is a first example of non&#8208;enzymatic catalytic one&#8208;pot protocol which allows a straightforward asymmetric synthesis of highly valuable mandelic acid derivatives from aldehyde feedstocks.

         <title>Highly Active and Stable Cu&#8722;Cd Bimetallic Oxides for Enhanced Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 4.73&#8201;% Cd&#8208;CuO catalyst exhibits remarkable activity and stability for CO2RR, while facile modulation of product selectivity from CO to C2+ can be readily achieved by precise control of electrolysis conditions. The enhanced performance of the electrocatalyst is ascribed to the introduction of CdO to improve the ability of CuO to activate CO2, the electronic interactions between Cu and Cd can boost the activation and conversion the key intermediates of CO2RR.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) can produce value&#8208;added chemicals such as carbon monoxide (CO) and multicarbon (C2+). However, the complex reaction pathways of CO2 electro&#8208;reduction reaction (CO2RR) greatly limit the product selectivity and conversion efficiency. Herein, the Cu&#8722;Cd bimetallic oxides catalyst was designed and applied for the CO2RR. The optimized 4.73&#8201;%Cd&#8208;CuO exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic CO2RR activity for selective CO production in H&#8208;cell using 0.5&#8197;M 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([Bmim]PF6)/MeCN as electrolyte. The Faradaic efficiency of CO (FE(CO)) can be maintained above 90&#8201;% over a wide potential range of &#8722;2.0 to &#8722;2.4&#8197;V vs. Ag/Ag+. Particularly, the catalyst achieves an impressive FE(CO) of 96.3&#8201;% with a current density of 60.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;2.2&#8197;V vs. Ag/Ag+. Furthermore, scaling up the 4.73&#8201;%Cd&#8208;CuO catalyst into a flow cell can reach 56.64&#8201;% FE of C2+ products (ethylene, ethanol and n&#8208;propanol) with a current density as high as 600&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 steadily. The excellent CO2RR performance of the as&#8208;synthesized 4.73&#8201;%Cd&#8208;CuO can be mainly attributed to the introduction of CdO to improve the ability of CuO to activate CO2, the electronic interactions between Cu and Cd can boost the activation and conversion the key intermediates of CO2RR and ensure the continuous stability of the 4.73&#8201;%Cd&#8208;CuO in electrolysis process.

         <title>Substitution of the Axial Type 1 Cu Ligand Affords Binding of a Water Molecule in Axial Position Affecting Kinetics, Spectral, and Structural Properties of the Small Laccase Ssl1</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining several spectroscopic methods provided evidence that the exchange of the axial methionine of the T1 Cu site in the small laccase Ssl1 by several non&#8208;coordinating amino acids allowed a water molecule to enter the axial position, resulting in a stronger influence on the T1 Cu reduction potential and the intermolecular electron transfer than the chemical properties of the introduced amino acid side chains.







Abstract
Multicopper oxidases use Cu ions as cofactors to oxidize various substrates. High reduction potential at Type 1 Cu is considered as crucial for effective catalysis. Previous studies have shown that replacing the axial methionine ligand of the Type 1 Cu with leucine or phenylalanine leads to an increased reduction potential, but not always to higher enzyme activity. Here we present a study on six variants of the small laccase Ssl1 from Streptomyces sviceus, where the axial methionine ligand was substituted, and the effect of the axial ligand on reduction potential, activity, spectral properties and structure was investigated. Absorption, electronic circular dichroism and EPR spectra revealed the presence of a stronger coordinating axial ligand like oxygen, which influences the electronic and catalytic properties more than the nature of the amino acid side chain. The crystal structures of the Ssl1 variants were solved, which show that none of the amino acid side chains coordinate to the Cu. Instead, a water molecule is found in the axial coordination site, which support the spectroscopic data. Our findings highlight the importance of combining structural and spectroscopic methods to investigate the effect of amino acid exchange on multicopper oxidases.

         <title>Unlocking the Potential of Push&#8208;Pull Pyridinic Photobases: Aggregation&#8208;Induced Excited&#8208;State Proton Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pH&#8208;dependent photophysics of three push&#8208;pull pyridines is addressed through steady&#8208;state and ultrafast spectroscopies. Aggregation is the key to multi&#8208;responsive fluorophores: appealing pKa values for cancer cell recognition; enhanced fluorescence efficiencies (&#966;F) for both neutral (Py&#8208;1) and protonated (Py&#8208;1(H+)) species, leading to acido(fluoro)chromism; longer singlet lifetimes (&#966;F) allowing the Excited&#8208;State Proton Transfer (ESPT) crucial for applications as photobases.







Abstract
The pH effect on the photophysics of three push&#8208;pull compounds bearing dimethoxytriphenylamine (TPA&#8208;OMe) as electron donor and pyridine as electron acceptor, with different ortho&#8208;functionalization (&#8722;H, &#8722;Br, and &#8722;TPA&#8208;OMe), is assessed through steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic techniques in DMSO/water mixed solutions and in water dispersions over a wide pH range. The enhanced intramolecular charge transfer upon protonation of the pyridinic ring leads to the acidochromic (from colorless to yellow) and acido(fluoro)chromic (from cyan to pink) behaviours of the investigated compounds. In dilute DMSO/buffer mixtures these molecules exhibited low pKa values (&#8804;3.5) and extremely short singlet lifetimes. Nevertheless, it is by exploiting the aggregation phenomenon in aqueous environment that the practical use of these compounds largely expands: i) the basicity increases (pKa&#8776;4.5) approaching the optimum values for pH&#8208;sensing in cancer cell recognition; ii) the fluorescence efficiencies are boosted due to Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE), making these compounds appealing as fluorescent probes; iii) longer singlet lifetimes enable Excited&#8208;State Proton Transfer, paving the way for the application of these molecules as photobases (pKa*=9.1). The synergy of charge and proton transfers combined to the AIE behaviour in these pyridines allows tunable multi&#8208;responsive optical properties providing valuable information for the design of new light&#8208;emitting photobases.

The incorporation of the DMA cation into triple cation perovskites significantly altered the crystal structure and grain growth of the perovskite films. This modification inhibited halide segregation and enhanced carrier mobility. As a result, a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.9&#8201;% was achieved for wide&#8208;bandgap PSCs with a bandgap of 1.68&#8197;eV. Furthermore, the stability of PSCs based on DMA&#8208;doped perovskite was substantially improved. After exposure to ambient air for 1500&#8197;hours, the unencapsulated device retained an impressive 80.6&#8201;% of its initial efficiency. This demonstrates the great potential of DMA doping for developing stable and efficient wide&#8208;bandgap PSCs.







Abstract
High efficiency and stable wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are crucial for the development of perovskite&#8208;based tandem solar cells. However, the efficiency and stability of WBG PSCs are compromised by significant phase segregation and surface defects. In this study, we introduce a cation engineering strategy for WBG perovskite, employing a two&#8208;step sequential method that incorporates dimethylamine hydroiodide (DMAI) into the lead halide complex during the initial step. The addition of DMAI modifies the crystal structure and grain growth of the perovskite film, leading to improved crystal quality, reduced photo&#8208;induced halide segregation, decreased defect density, and enhanced charge carrier mobility. Consequently, we achieved a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.9&#8201;% for 1.68&#8197;eV WBG PSCs. Furthermore, the stability of PSCs based on DMA&#8208;doped perovskite was significantly improved. After 1500&#8197;hours of exposure to ambient air, the unencapsulated device retained an impressive 80.6&#8201;% of its initial efficiency. This result highlights the substantial potential for stable and efficient WBG PSCs.

         <title>Focus on Physico&#8208;Chemical Properties of Sulfoximines: Acidity, Basicity and Lipophilicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although sulfoximines are emerging entities in chemistry, no physico&#8208;chemical are present in the literature. We disclose here a comprehensive study on the measurement of their acidity, basicity and the determination of their Hansch parameters.







Abstract
Despite the numerous published syntheses and applications of sulfoximines, very few studies describe their physico&#8208;chemical properties and in particular their acidic, basic and lipophilic or hydrophilic characters. We report for the first time the acidity values (pKa) of fluorinated sulfoximines in water and in acetonitrile, as well as the basicity (pKaH) measurements of fluorinated and non&#8208;fluorinated sulfoximines in acetonitrile. The same sulfoximine library was also studied in terms of lipophilicity with measurement of the Hansch parameters of the sulfoximine moieties. Finally, these new data allowed us to optimize the N&#8208;alkylation reaction of fluorinated sulfoximines.

         <title>When the Study of the Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification Method on a 1D Spin Crossover Coordination Polymer Highlights its Catalytic Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spin crossover iron complex, with the formula [Fe(NH2trz)3](NO3)2, catalyzes imine formation from 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole and aldehyde. During catalysis, the iron complex undergoes two different PSM reactions: the first with an aldehyde and the second with an aminotriazole. These PSM reactions are thought to be involved in the catalytic mechanism of this iron&#8208;based coordination polymer.







Abstract
We are interested in studying the catalytic activity of the spin crossover (SCO) complex ([Fe(NH2trz)3](NO3)2). In this work, we demonstrate that, by adapting the experimental conditions, we can switch from a quantitative post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) reaction to the use of this complex as a catalyst for the formation of imine from 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole. During the catalytic reaction, the iron complex undergoes two different PSM reactions: the first is the action of the aldehyde on the NH2 groups present on the complex, whereas the second PSM reaction occurs between the imine complex and aminotriazole, leading back to the starting complex. These two PSM reactions are at least partially involved in the catalytic mechanism. Furthermore, the combination of these two PSM reactions enables us to modulate the particle size and shape of the final amine complex without altering its excellent SCO properties. This result is of interest in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, where particle size has a strong influence on the catalytic activity, and for the proper integration in devices for different applications.

         <title>Nucleophilic Amination of Aryl Halides with an Azanide Surrogate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the development of an azanide (&#8722;NH2) surrogate which enables the facile conversion of (hetero)aryl halides into primary N&#8208;aryl amines under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions. The designed amidine reagent is easy to prepare, bench stable, and undergoes facile N&#8208;arylation under basic conditions at 40 &#176;C. Intermediate N&#8208;aryl amidines are readily cleaved to form N&#8208;aryl amines in situ through hydrolysis or base&#8208;promoted elimination. The developed surrogate is a safer and more selective alternative to existing anionic N&#8208;nucleophiles, such as alkali metal amides or azide salts.</dc:description>

         <title>Stimuli Induced Reversible Switching Between a Self&#8208;assembled 2&#8208;Catenane and the Constituent Coordination Rings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A pair of comparable sized C&#8208;shaped bis&#8208;monodentate ligands (L1 and L22+) and a linear bis&#8208;monodentate ligand (L3) complimenting to the terminal&#8208;lengths of the C&#8208;shaped ligands have been identified. One&#8208;pot combination of cis&#8208;Pd(tmeda)2+, L1 and L3 (2:1:1 ratio) in water resulted an octa&#8208;cationic 2&#8208;catenane, [Pd2(tmeda)2(L1)(L3)]28+ in which two identical tetra&#8208;cationic macromonocyclic coordination rings are interlocked; however, a guest bound coordination ring was formed in presence of a selected di&#8208;anionic guest. Complexation of cis&#8208;Pd(tmeda)2+ with a mixture of L22+ and L3 (2:1:1 ratio) in water resulted the hexa&#8208;cationic macromonocyclic coordination ring, [Pd2(tmeda)2(L2)(L3)]6+ whereas&#160; a guest bound coordination ring was formed in the presence of the di&#8208;anionic guest.&#160; Addition of the guest to the preformed octa&#8208;cationic catenane caused ring separation to favour the guest&#8208;bound ring. This guest bound ring could be reverted to the 2&#8208;catenane by sequestering the bound guest using the relatively electron deficient hexa&#8208;cationic coordination ring. Thus, a design principle for reversible switching between a 2&#8208;catenane and the constituent macromonocyclic&#8208;rings using anion&#8208;binding/&#8208;sequestering as the core concept has been established.</dc:description>

         <title>NIR Diradical&#8208;Featured   Croconaine Nanoagent for Cancer Photoacoustic Imaging and Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radical&#8208;featured organic materials usually demonstrate significantly narrower bandgap than that of regular organic materials, which is beneficial for near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption and non&#8208;radiative decay process, making them good candidates for photothermal agents (PTAs) of photothermal therapy (PTT). &#160;However, most organic radicals are too short&#8208;lived to be separated and stable. Herein, a stable pyrylium&#8208;croconaine (CR) dye CR845 with high diradical character was synthesized and assembled into CR845 nanoparticles (NPs) to explore the photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and photothermal therapeutic performance under NIR irradiation in vitro&#160;and in vivo. CR845 exhibited a stable NIR absorption at 845 nm (&#949;&#160;= 3.37 &#215; 105&#160;L mol&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;1) and a relatively high photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of 58.8%. When assembled into nanoparticles, CR845 NPs showed good photostability, good biocompatibility, favorable NIR photoacoustic potential, effective cancer cell killing and complete tumor elimination upon 850 nm laser irradiation. The work demonstrates a diradical&#8208;featured CR PTA with favorable PAI/PTT effects, which can help to provide new ideas for the development of NIR PTAs, and further promote the application of organic radical materials in the field of biomedicine.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we present a method for the diastereoselective synthesis of N&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;substituted cyclobutanes from commercially available bromocyclobutanes. This method enables the efficient formation of various heterocyclic aminocyclobutane esters and amides using simple reagents. Notably, N&#8208;nucleophiles such as imidazoles, azoles, and nucleobase derivatives were successfully incorporated, enhancing the chemical diversity of small ring building blocks for medicinal chemistry applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Activity of Cellulose&#8208;supported Platinum and&#160;Palladium Nanoparticles for Allylbenzene Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Platinum and palladium nanoparticles were successfully deposited on tunicate cellulose via the photodeposition or microemulsion deposition method. Evenly distributed, small and narrow&#8208;sized particles in the range of 2&#8209;3 nm&#160;were obtained for microemulsion&#8208;prepared cellulose catalysts. The photodeposition method led to larger particle sizes, broader size distribution, and occasional agglomerations. The catalysts were tested in the allylbenzene hydrogenation reaction and the results were compared to commercially available catalysts. Because of smaller particles, both microemulsion&#8208;prepared catalysts and photodeposited ones show better activity than commercial catalysts. Even platinum and palladium nanoparticles were active for the hydrogenation, only cellulose&#8208;supported platinum nanoparticles showed good stability. For palladium nanoparticles, stronger leaching from the surface of cellulose was observed. Cellulose&#8208;supported catalysts were recycled, and reusability is comparable to commercial catalysts. Therefore, cellulose could be used as an alternative catalyst support.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of ionic liquid film thickness and flow rate on macrocyclization efficiency and selectivity in supported ionic liquid&#8208;liquid phase catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supported ionic&#8208;liquid phase (SILP) technology in a biphasic setting with n&#8208;heptane as the transport phase was applied to the Ru&#8208;alkylidene&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalyzed macrocyclization of&#160; &#945;,&#969;&#8208;dienes to elucidate the effect of ionic liquid (IL)&#8208;film thickness, flow rate as well as substrate and product concentration on macrocyclization efficiency, and Z&#8208;selectivity. To understand the molecular&#8208;level behavior of the substrates and products at the n&#8208;heptane/IL interphase, atomistic molecular dynamics simulations were conducted and correlated with experimental observations. The thickness of the IL layer strongly influences the Z/E ratio of the products in that a thin IL layer favors higher Z/E ratios by confining the catalyst between the pore wall and the liquid&#8208;liquid interphase whereas a thick IL layer favors formation of the E&#8208;product and Ru&#8208;hydride catalyzed isomerization reactions. Also, macrocyclization efficiency, expressed by the ratio of oligomers/macromonocycle (O/MMC), is influenced both by the flow rate and the thickness of the IL layer.</dc:description>

         <title>From a P&#8208;Bridging Phosphaketene to &#956;&#8208;Phosphinidenide and &#956;&#8208;Diphosphaurea Units at a Dinickel Core</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Salt metathesis of dinickel(II) complex LNi2Br (1; L is a dinucleating pyrazolate ligand with two &#946;&#8208;diketiminato chelate arms) with Na(OCP)&#8729;(dioxane)2.5 yielded LNi2(PCO) (2) with a P&#8208;bridging phosphaethynolate. Further reaction of 2 with benzyl isocyanide or with an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) triggered decarbonylation and gave LNi2(PCN&#8208;CH2Ph) (3) and LNi2P(NHC) (4) with P&#8208;bridging cyanophosphide and NHC&#8208;phosphinidenide, respectively. Electronic structure analysis indicated a &#956;2&#8208;&#951;2:&#951;1 binding mode of the PCO&#8211; anion between the two NiII ions in 2, which is even more pronounced for the [PCN(&#8208;CH2Ph)]&#8722; anion in 3. DFT assessment of the formation mechanism of 4 showed that attack at the phosphaketene&#8208;C atom is kinetically preferred but reversible and unproductive, while kinetically more demanding back&#8208;side SN2 attack at the phosphaketene&#8208;P atom triggers CO release with 4 as thermodynamic product. Nucleophilic addition at the phosphaketene&#8208;C could be demonstrated by the strongly exergonic reaction of 2 with KPPh2, giving unstable K[LNi2(P(O)CPPh2)] (5) with a P&#8208;bridging and K+&#8208;stabilized diphosphaurea derivative. All new complexes 2&#8211;5 have been comprehensively characterized, including by X&#8208;ray diffraction.</dc:description>

         <title>Twofold 6&#960;&#8208;Electrocyclization as a Route Toward Multi&#8208;Heteroatom&#8208;Doped Nanographenes Built&#160;on 1,4&#8208;Dihydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole Core</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we present a highly versatile synthetic strategy based on twofold 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization accompanied with HBr elimination as a novel approach towards centrosymmetric multi&#8208;heteroatom&#8208;doped nanographenes build around an electron&#8208;rich 1,4&#8208;dihydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole core. A straightforward synthesis from readily available substrates offers a unique possibility of fusing the 1,4&#8208;dihydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole subunit not only with carbocyclic building blocks, such as electron&#8208;deficient phenanthrenes, chrysenes, or [4]helicenes, but also with heterocyclic systems, such as benzo[b]furan and 5&#8208;thiatruxene. The clear advantage of this strategy is that there is no requirement to assemble complex scaffolds possessing bromoaryl units since bromine atom is introduced by bromination of 1,4&#8208;dihydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole core which, because of its exceptionally electron&#8208;rich character, is universal and straightforward reaction. The obtained &#967;&#8208;shaped and S&#8208;shaped nanographenes containing 10 or more fused rings, exhibit visible&#8208;range emissions characterized by fluorescence quantum yields reaching 48%. Computational studies of the reaction mechanism revealed that the 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization is kinetically favourable over photo&#8208;induced direct arylation. Steady&#8208;state UV/Visible spectroscopy reveals that upon photoexcitation, the prepared S&#8208;shaped N&#8208;doped nanographenes undergo mostly radiative relaxation leading to large fluorescence quantum yields. We anticipate that this chemistry will empower the creation of new materials with various functionalities.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution from Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have demonstrated significant potential as photocatalysts for efficiently generating hydrogen through photocatalytic water splitting. However, the design of COFs with distinct organic unit blocks at a molecular level profoundly influences their photocatalytic performance. In this study, we synthesized a series of &#946;&#8208;ketoamine COFs through molecular engineering of nitrogen sites, including phenyl&#8208;structured TpBD, phenylpyridine&#8208;structured TpPpy, phenylpyrimidine&#8208;structured TpPpm, and bipyridine&#8208;structured TpBpy. Advanced characterization techniques reveal that TpPpm and TpBpy with more nitrogen sites exhibit superior efficiencies in electron transfer and charge separation compared to TpBD and TpPpy, thereby endowing them with enhanced photocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution from water. As a result, the photocatalytic hydrogen production rates of TpPpm (33.80 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) and TpBpy (29.18 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) surpass those of TpBD (20.82 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) and TpPpy (27.49 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). Additionally, due to the different plane symmetries between Ppm and Bpy resulting from the various positions of nitrogen sites, TpPpm displays superior photochemical properties and better photocatalytic performance compared to TpBpy. Moreover, theoretical calculation results further confirm the exceptional intramolecular charge transfer ability of TpPpm among all COFs. This work underscores the significance of precisely controlling N sites in COFs for designing high&#8208;performance photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present the preparation and investigation of a fluorine&#8208;free surface&#8208;active bis&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) platinum(II) complex &#8212; trans&#8208;[Pt(mPEG3C8Im)2Cl2] &#8212; for interface&#8208;enhanced supported ionic liquid phase (SILP) catalysis within a group of (mPEGn)&#8208;substituted ionic liquids (ILs) ([(mPEGn)2Im][A] ILs). The complex was characterized by means of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (scXRD) analysis and multinuclear (1H, 13C, 195Pt) NMR spectroscopy, indicating the presence of two almost equimolar syn&#8211;anti rotamers of the square&#8208;planar complex in solution. Angle&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ARXPS) revealed pronounced interface&#8208;accumulation of trans&#8208;[Pt(mPEG3C8Im)2Cl2] in IL solutions of [(mPEG2)2Im][A] (A&#8722; = I&#8722; and PF6&#8722;).</dc:description>

         <title>Activation of CO2, CS2, and COS by &#945;&#8208;Diimine&#8208;stabilized Gallylenes</title>

         <dc:description>Several gallylenes [LPhGaM(THF)n] stabilized by an &#945;&#8208;diimine ligand (LPh = [(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3)NC(Ph)]2; M = Li, n = 3, 3&#8208;Li; M = Na, n = 4, 3&#8208;Na; M = K, n = 1, 3&#8208;K) were prepared, which display diverse reactivities toward carbon dioxide and its sulfurized analogues.

Herein, we developed glycosyl 2&#8242;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;methylpropionates as glycosyl donors, which can be activated by TMSOTf through remote activation. Both O&#8208;glycosylation and C&#8208;glycosylation were efficiently executed within 1&#8197;h at room temperature. The glycosylation protocol was characterized by its straightforward operation and broad applicability to various substrates.







Abstract
Herein, we developed a Lewis acid&#8208;mediated O&#8208;glycosylation and C&#8208;glycosylation protocol using stable glycosyl 2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;methylpropionates as donors. These glycosylation reactions reached completion within 1&#8197;h at room temperature. The practicality of this protocol is characterized by their straightforward operation and efficient applicability to various substrates, including both disarmed and armed glycosyl donors, through the remote activation of easily accessible TMSOTf.

         <title>Rational Assembly of Three&#8208;component Coordination Polymers as Heterogeneous Catalysts for CO2 Cycloaddition and Cyanosilylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four new coordination polymers were constructed. The catalytic performance study showed that the CP 1 exhibited good catalytic efficiency and excellent substrate tolerance in the cycloaddition reaction of CO2 and cyanosilylation of aldehydes under mild conditions. Therefore, the CP 1 was considered efficient and stable heterogeneous catalysts for above the two reactions.







Abstract
Four new coordination polymers based on 5&#8208;(((1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methyl)amino) isophthalic acid (H3L) and auxiliary ligands (1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine, and 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine), namely, {[Zn(HL)(phen)(H2O)]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O}n (CP 1), {[Ni(HL)(phen)(H2O)]}n (CP 2), {[Ni(HL)(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bpy)(H2O)]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O}n (CP 3) and {[Cd(HL)(4,4&#8242;&#8208;bpy)0.5(H2O)]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O}n (CP 4) were rationally assembled. Furthermore, these four CPs were screened as heterogeneous catalysts for CO2 cycloaddition and cyanosilylation reactions under mild conditions. The catalytic experiments showed that CP 1 had the better catalytic performance, excellent substrate tolerance and recyclability for the above two reactions. It is speculated that the excellent activity of CP 1 may be due to the open Lewis base site and the Lewis acidic characteristics of the zinc (II) center. After five cycles, the catalytic activities of CP 1 did not significantly decrease, and the structures remained unchanged. Therefore, the CP 1 was considered efficient and stable heterogeneous catalysts for above the two reactions.

It is speculated that the excellent activity of &lt;b&gt;CP 1&lt;/b&gt; may be due to the open Lewis base site and the Lewis acidic characteristics of the zinc (II) center. After five cycles, the catalytic activities of &lt;b&gt;CP 1&lt;/b&gt; did not significantly decrease, and the structures remained unchanged. Therefore, the &lt;b&gt;CP 1&lt;/b&gt; was considered efficient and stable heterogeneous catalysts for above the two reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhancing the Chemical Stability of P12L24 Cage: Transformation of the Chemically Labile Imine Cage into a Robust Carbamate Cage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report enhancement in chemical stability of the imine&#8208;based porphyrinic cage P12L24 by converting it into a robust carbamate porphyrinic cage, c&#8208;P12L24, through a two&#8208;step post&#8208;synthetic modification process. Furthermore, encapsulation of molecular ruler has been demonstrated for the potential application.







Abstract
Herein, we report enhancement in chemical stability of the imine&#8208;based porphyrinic cage P12L24 by converting it into a robust carbamate porphyrinic cage, c&#8208;P12L24, through a two&#8208;step post&#8208;synthetic modification process. First, the imine bonds in P12L24 were reduced to form an amine&#8208;based cage, r&#8208;P12L24, followed by carbamation using N,N&#8242;&#8208;carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) to yield c&#8208;P12L24. The resulting carbamate cage exhibits high stability under acidic and basic conditions (pH&#8197;1&#8211;13) and in the presence of moisture. 1H NMR, DOSY NMR, and DFT calculations revealed that reducing the imine bonds to amine increases the framework's flexibility, causing partial structural collapse, whereas the carbamate formation restores structural rigidity. The insertion of a 4.0&#8197;nm molecular ruler into the cavity of zinc&#8208;metallated c&#8208;P12L24 via metal&#8208;ligand coordination further confirmed restoration of the cavity size and geometry of the original cage. This enhancement of chemical stability through carbamate formation can pave the way to a wide range of potential applications for the gigantic porphyrinic cage.

         <title>Unlocking the Chemical and Structural Complexity of Aluminum Hydroxy Acetates: from Commodity Chemicals to Porous Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;throughput investigation involving more than 330 reactions in the system Al3+/CH3COOH/NaOH/H2O permitted the elucidation of the synthesis&#8208;structure relationship and allowed us to shed light on the structural chemistry and porosity of aluminum acetates for the first time. The robust synthesis procedures permitted scale&#8208;up under mild reaction conditions in high yields.







Abstract
Aluminum acetates have been in use for more than a century, but despite their widespread commercial applications, essential scientific knowledge of their synthesis&#8208;structure&#8208;property relationships is lacking. High&#8208;throughput screening, followed by fine tuning and extensive optimization of reaction conditions using Al3+, OH&#8722; and CH3COO&#8722; ions, has unraveled their complex synthetic chemistry, yielding for the first time the four phase pure products Al(OH)(O2CCH3)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;x H2O (x=0, 2) (1A and CAU&#8208;65, 1B), Al3O(HO2CCH3)(O2CCH3)7 (2), and the porous aluminum salt [Al24(OH)56(CH3COO)12](OH)4 (CAU&#8208;55&#8208;OH, 3). Structure determination by electron and X&#8208;ray diffraction was carried out and the data suggested porosity for 1B and 3, which was confirmed by physisorption experiments. Even the scale&#8208;up to the 10&#8197;L scale was accomplished for 1A, 1B and 3 with yields of up to 1.1&#8197;kg (99&#8201;%). This study of a seemingly simple chemical system provides important information on both fundamental inorganic chemistry and porous materials.

         <title>Frustrated Radical Pairs: From Fleeting Intermediates to Isolable Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we report the design of stable para&#8208;substituted triarylamine&#8722;DDQ radical ion pairs (RIPs). We investigated several combinations using a wide variety of spectroscopic methods such as IR, EPR and NMR, both in solution and in the solid state. We quantified the degree of single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) and found that both the substituents (MeO &gt; tBu &gt; Br) and the polarity of solvents (MeCN &gt; DCM &gt; toluene) can lead to a greater degree of SET.







Abstract
We present the design and comprehensive investigation of stable para&#8208;substituted triarylamine&#8211;2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ) radical ion pairs (RIPs) generated via single&#8208;electron transfer (SET). We quantified the degree of SET in both solution and solid phases, utilising a suite of spectroscopic techniques including IR, EPR, NMR, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8211;XRD). Our findings reveal that the extent of SET is significantly influenced by the nature of the substituents (MeO &gt; tBu &gt; Br) and the polarity of the solvent (MeCN &gt; DCM &gt; toluene). The radical ion pair [(pMeOPh)3N]&#8901;+[DDQ]&#8901;&#8722; was unambiguously identified using EPR and UV&#8211;vis spectroscopy, and its structure was confirmed by SC&#8211;XRD. Detailed analysis indicates an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state with a thermally accessible triplet state, as corroborated by EPR, magnetic susceptibility measurements, and DFT calculations. This study offers crucial insights into the mechanistic pathways of RIP formation and tuning both in solution and solid states, laying the groundwork for future exploration of their reactivity and potential applications.

         <title>Construction and Comparative Research of Two MOFs Proton Conducting Materials Containing Nitro Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two nitro&#8208;containing Cd&#8208;based MOFs, MOF&#8208;1 and MOF&#8208;2, are being synthesized and investigated for their proton conductivity. Both materials show peak conductivity at 98% RH and 90 &#176;C, with MOF&#8208;1 demonstrating significantly higher proton conductivity (9.13 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S&#8901;cm&#8722;1) compared to MOF&#8208;2 (3.00&#215;10&#8722;3 S&#8901;cm&#8722;1). The study emphasizes the role of nitrate in enhancing proton conduction.







Abstract
In field of electrochemistry, there has been a growing interest in the potential applications of proton&#8208;conducting metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). Therefore, how to design and synthesize MOFs with high proton conductivity is considered crucial. In this study, two examples of nitro&#8208;containing Cd&#8208;based MOFs, MOF&#8208;1 {[Cd3(TIPE)1.5(NO3)5Cl(H2O)2]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;17H2O}n and MOF&#8208;2 {[Cd(TIPE)0.5(nip)]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10H2O}n (TIPE=1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;(1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;1&#8208;yl)phenyl)ethene, H2nip=5&#8208;Nitroisophthalic Acid), had been successfully designed and synthesized, and their proton&#8208;conducting properties were thoroughly investigated. Notably, both materials displayed peak proton conductivity at 98&#8201;% RH and 90&#8201;&#176;C, exhibiting values of 9.13&#215;10&#8722;3 and 3.00&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 for MOF&#8208;1 and MOF&#8208;2, respectively. The plausible proton conduction pathways and mechanisms were elucidated through structural analyses, water vapor adsorption studies, and the determination of activation energy (Ea) values. It was found that the difference in proton conductivity between MOF&#8208;1 and MOF&#8208;2 was mainly associated with the different water absorption rates of the samples. The uniqueness of this study was that for the first time conducted an in&#8208;depth study of the role of nitrate in proton conduction, providing new ideas for designing materials with excellent proton conductivity.

Both materials show peak conductivity at 98% RH and 90 &#176;C, with MOF-&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; demonstrating significantly higher proton conductivity (9.13 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; S&#8901;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) compared to MOF-&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; (3.00&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; S&#8901;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). The study emphasizes the role of nitrate in enhancing proton conduction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In field of electrochemistry, there has been a growing interest in the potential applications of proton-conducting metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Therefore, how to design and synthesize MOFs with high proton conductivity is considered crucial. In this study, two examples of nitro-containing Cd-based MOFs, MOF-&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; {[Cd&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(TIPE)&lt;sub&gt;1.5&lt;/sub&gt;(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;17H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O}&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; and MOF-&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; {[Cd(TIPE)&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;(nip)]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O}&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; (TIPE=1,1,2,2-tetrakis(4-(&lt;i&gt;1&lt;/i&gt;H-imidazole-1-yl)phenyl)ethene, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;nip=5-Nitroisophthalic Acid), had been successfully designed and synthesized, and their proton-conducting properties were thoroughly investigated. Notably, both materials displayed peak proton conductivity at 98&#8201;% RH and 90&#8201;&#176;C, exhibiting values of 9.13&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; and 3.00&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for MOF-&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and MOF-&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, respectively. The plausible proton conduction pathways and mechanisms were elucidated through structural analyses, water vapor adsorption studies, and the determination of activation energy (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;) values. It was found that the difference in proton conductivity between MOF-&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and MOF-&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; was mainly associated with the different water absorption rates of the samples. The uniqueness of this study was that for the first time conducted an in-depth study of the role of nitrate in proton conduction, providing new ideas for designing materials with excellent proton conductivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tuning Tetramethoxy&#8208;acridiniums for Fluorophores and Organic Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;fluorescent tetramethoxy&#8208;acridinium (TMAcr+) become fluorescent when substituted with electron withdrawing groups, due to inhibition of intramolecular PET quenching. Fluorescence quantum yield up to &#966;f=20&#8201;% and a long fluorescence lifetime of &#964;f=9&#8197;ns in CH2Cl2 are obtained. The TMAcr+ can be used as photooxidants due to their excited state reduction potentials (E*red=1.6&#8197;V vs. SCE).







Abstract
Tetramethoxy substituted alkyl&#8208;acridiniums (TMAcr+) are readily available by facile nucleophilic aromatic substitution on tris(2,6&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl)carbenium, but are non&#8208;fluorescent, presumably due to intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer quenching. In this work we introduce electron withdrawing groups by electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions, leading to fluorescence turn&#8208;on. The acridiniums are moderately fluorescent (&#966;f=20&#8201;%) with long fluorescene lifetimes (&#964;f=9&#8197;ns). The positive excited state reduction potentials (E*red=+1.6&#8197;V) make the TMAcr+ excellent electron acceptors in the excited state, and efficient reductive photoredox catalysts able to oxidize a broad range of substrates.

         <title>Recent Advances in NIR&#8208;Switchable Multi&#8208;Redox Systems Based on Organic Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#960;&#8208;Conjugated organic systems with multi&#8208;step redox behavior often exhibit electrochromic properties. Among them, organic molecules that can exhibit ON/OFF switching of NIR absorption are rare but have been developed rapidly. Isolation, structural determination, and electrochemical and spectroscopic measurements of multiple redox states are essential for a better understanding of their natures.







Abstract
Electrochromic systems capable of switching absorption in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region (750&#8211;2500&#8197;nm) are attractive from the viewpoint of applications for material and life science, and thus several examples have been reported to date. In general, the development of organic&#8208;based systems is needed to reduce the environmental impact and improve biocompatibility. Although extending the switchable spectral range is crucial for the application of organic electrochromic molecules, the switching of NIR absorption based on redox interconversion is still a challenging issue regarding reversibility and durability during interconversion. To overcome this potential instability, the introduction of heteroatoms into the molecular backbone and/or &#960;&#8208;extension could be useful strategies in terms of effective delocalization of charge and spin in the corresponding redox states. In this review, we focus on redox&#8208;active well&#8208;defined small molecules that enable ON/OFF switching of NIR absorption based on precise control of the redox states, and present recent studies on their intrinsic electrochemical and spectroscopic properties and/or structural characterization of their charged states.

         <title>Syn vs. Anti? What Controls Addition Stereochemistry in Chlorolactonization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Syn vs. anti chlorolactonization of an alkenoic acid was investigated using a deuterated analog. Product ratios (syn vs. anti) were dependent on a number of factors, although concentrations were most determinant. Kinetic analysis (Variable Time Normalized Analysis, VTNA) complemented with computational studies led to two proposed transition states that lead to the syn and anti products.







Abstract
The stereochemistry of the uncatalyzed chlorolactonization of 4&#8208;phenylpent&#8208;4&#8208;enoic acid at room temperature was examined to probe the reaction's intrinsic diastereoselectivities as a function of chlorenium ion donor, solvent polarity, and reactant concentration ranges. Kinetic studies using Variable Time Normalization Analysis (VTNA) revealed differing reaction orders for the syn and anti alkene addition processes. Aided and illustrated by quantum chemical modeling, this detailed mechanistic analysis of the substrate's intrinsic chlorolactonization reactions points to concerted AdE3&#8208;type paths for both syn and anti additions. By illuminating the factors selecting for syn&#8208; vs anti&#8208;addition paths, the results provide key reference points for future studies of stereocontrol in halofunctionalization reactions.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic two&#8208;dimensional materials have garnered widespread attention due to their well&#8208;defined structures, structural diversity, and rich electronic effects, demonstrating significant application potential across various fields. Atomic&#8208;level manipulation of the structures of organic two&#8208;dimensional materials has been a primary strategy for enriching and optimizing their properties. The introduction of heteroatoms often significantly affects their electronic structure, thereby endowing these materials with novel and unique properties. Boron atoms, due to their electron&#8208;deficient nature, have been extensively studied in luminescent materials, semiconductor materials, and chemical sensing materials. Consequently, boron&#8208;containing organic two&#8208;dimensional materials are also believed to be promising as a new class of materials with excellent optoelectronic and chemical activities.

         <title>Study on intelligent bionic superhydrophobic material and its oil&#8208;water separation mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Surface Sulfurization of Cubic Cu2O to Form Cu2S Nanostructure&#8208;Decorated Catalysts for Light&#8208;Enhanced Electrocatalytic H2 Evolution and Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Slight surface sulfurization was employed to prepare cubic Cu2O@Cu2S core&#8208;shell structures, which can deliver a maximum high surface photovoltage (SPV) of 30 mV. The as&#8208;prepared Cu2O@Cu2S has demonstrated efficient charge separation and migration, which then served as high&#8208;performance bifunctional catalysts for light&#8208;enhanced electrocatalytic H2 evolution and photocatalytic CH4 production, suggesting its promising applications in light&#8208;driven catalysis.







Abstract
Developing highly efficient bifunctional catalysts for electrocatalysis and photocatalysis suffers from sluggish charge transfer and poor photo&#8208;to&#8208;electric conversion rate. Herein, micro&#8208;sized Cu2O cubes were initially prepared for subsequent transformation into Cu2O@Cu2S core&#8208;shell structures by a slight surface sulfurization. The formation of nanostructured Cu2S thin layer at Cu2O surface can endow an immediate charge separation and migration under light irradiation, leading to high surface photovoltages (SPV, 18&#8211;30&#8197;mV). As a result, the as&#8208;prepared Cu2O@Cu2S catalysts exhibited reduced overpotentials (&#951;, only 86&#8197;mV is required for the optimized sample to achieve a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) for H2 evolution with good cycling stability in electrocatalytic water splitting. Meanwhile, a high methane (CH4) production rate of 30.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 can be delivered from the optimized Cu2O@Cu2S sample when used for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. This work has provided a strategy to prepare bifunctional catalysts with improved photoelectric properties for photo/electrocatalytic applications.

         <title>Free Alcohol&#8208;Mediated Radical Alkynylation and Allylation of Unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel free aliphatic alcohol&#8208;mediated radical alkynylation and allylation of unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds is disclosed. The transition&#8208;metal free protocol features exclusive site&#8208;selectivity, high product diversity, and simple operation, supplying a robust manifold for C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization using easily available aliphatic alcohols as feedstock.







Abstract
The daunting challenges in converting alcoholic O&#8722;H bonds with high bond&#8208;dissociation energy (BDE) to alkoxy radicals and harnessing those unruly reaction species largely limit exploiting free alcohols in C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization. Herein we describe a novel radical alkynylation and allylation of unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds with unmodified aliphatic alcohols. The use of phenyliodine bis(trifluoroacetate) (PIFA) enables the formation of alkoxy radicals under mild photochemical conditions. &#945;&#8208;Methyl styrene serves as a sacrificial&#8208;reagent that significantly improves the reaction outcomes. This transition&#8208;metal free protocol further features broad substrate scope, exclusive site&#8208;selectivity, high product diversity, and simple operation, supplying a robust manifold for C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization using easily available aliphatic alcohols as feedstock.

         <title>Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;Derived Tetracarboxylate Featuring AIE Properties for Dual Ion Sensing and Mechanochromic Self&#8208;Erasable Writing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aggregation&#8208;induced emission molecule (TPEC) derived from tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based tetracarboxylate was designed and synthesized. It self&#8208;assembles into single&#8208;layer nanosheets in water, demonstrating multifunctional capabilities: fluorescence colorimetric sensing for Al3+ ions, fluorescence quenching sensing for Fe3+ ions, and mechanochromism for self&#8208;erasable writing.







Abstract
The integration of multiple functions within a single fluorescent molecule provides a promising platform for developing versatile, efficient, and cost&#8208;effective materials with enhanced performance across diverse applications. In this study, we introduce TPEC, an aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) molecule derived from tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based tetracarboxylate, which demonstrates multifunctional capabilities, including metal ion sensing and self&#8208;erasable writing. TPEC exhibits amphiphilicity in water, self&#8208;assembling into single&#8208;layer nanosheets with robust blue fluorescence. Notably, the aqueous solution of TPEC displays a fluorescence colorimetric response to Al3+ ions and fluorescence quenching in the presence of Fe3+ ions. Additionally, TPEC powders undergo fluorescence colorimetric changes under mechanical stimulation, enabling self&#8208;erasable writing on prepared paper. This study presents a straightforward strategy for the development of multifunctional luminescent materials based on the self&#8208;assembly of a single&#8208;component fluorophore.

         <title>Isoreticular Contraction in Dicopper Paddle&#8208;Wheel&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks to Enhance C2H2/CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two isoreticualr MOFs of Cu&#8208;TPTC and Cu&#8208;ABTC were meticulously prepared. By strategically incorporating an azo group in place of a phenyl ring in the tetracarboxylate linker, Cu&#8208;ABTC demonstrated a modest decrease in pore size while retaining high porosity relative to Cu&#8208;TPTC. This modification led to a marked improvement in C2H2 adsorption capacity and C2H2/CO2 separation selectivity of Cu&#8208;ABTC, along with an extended breakthrough time.







Abstract
Achieving a balance between high selectivity and uptake is a formidable challenge for the purification of acetylene from mixtures with carbon dioxide, particularly when seeking to maximize both C2H2 adsorption capacity and C2H2/CO2 separation selectivity in crystalline porous materials. In this study, leveraging the principles of reticular chemistry, we selected two tetracarboxylate&#8208;based linkers and combined them with Cu2+ ions to synthesize two isoreticular dicopper paddle&#8208;wheel&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs): Cu&#8208;TPTC (terphenyl&#8208;3,3&#8217;,5,5&#8217;&#8208;tetracarboxylic acid, H4TPTC) and Cu&#8208;ABTC (3,3,5,5&#8208;azobenzenetetracarboxylic acid, H4ABTC). The structural and sorption analyses revealed that Cu&#8208;ABTC, despite having slightly smaller pores due to the strategic replacement of a phenyl ring with an azo group between two tetratopic ligands, maintains high porosity compared to Cu&#8208;TPTC. Furthermore, Cu&#8208;ABTC outperforms Cu&#8208;TPTC in terms of C2H2 adsorption capacity (196&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 298&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar) and C2H2/CO2 separation selectivity (16.5~5.6). These findings were corroborated by dynamic breakthrough experiments and computational modeling. This research highlights the potential of the isoreticular contraction strategy in enhancing MOFs for sophisticated gas adsorption and separation processes.

In this study, leveraging the principles of reticular chemistry, we selected two tetracarboxylate-based linkers and combined them with Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions to synthesize two isoreticular dicopper paddle-wheel-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs): Cu-TPTC (terphenyl-3,3&#8217;,5,5&#8217;-tetracarboxylic acid, H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;TPTC) and Cu-ABTC (3,3,5,5-azobenzenetetracarboxylic acid, H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;ABTC). The structural and sorption analyses revealed that Cu-ABTC, despite having slightly smaller pores due to the strategic replacement of a phenyl ring with an azo group between two tetratopic ligands, maintains high porosity compared to Cu-TPTC. Furthermore, Cu-ABTC outperforms Cu-TPTC in terms of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption capacity (196&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 298&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar) and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation selectivity (16.5~5.6). These findings were corroborated by dynamic breakthrough experiments and computational modeling. This research highlights the potential of the isoreticular contraction strategy in enhancing MOFs for sophisticated gas adsorption and separation processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fluorescent Coating through Melanisation of Merocyanine Based on Catechol Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel NIR&#8208;fluorophore featuring a merocyanine core and catechol moiety was synthesised for the first time using a straightforward multicomponent approach. Leveraging the catechol's exceptional surface adhesion and polymerisation capabilities, innovative fluorescent polymeric coatings were successfully developed on substrates, including glass, cupronickel, and polypropylene, via bioinspired melanisation. This work paves the way for advanced applications in surface functionalisation and material science.







Abstract
In this study, we present a novel approach for synthesising a merocyanine (MC) compound that integrates gallol and a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorophore using a straightforward method. We conduct a comprehensive structural analysis to elucidate the specific roles of each functional group during monomer synthesis and their effects on the properties of both the spiropyran (SP) and MC forms, particularly their fluorescence. As a proof of concept, we explore the use of these compounds in formulating innovative fluorescent polymeric coatings by melanising catechol and gallol moieties on various substrates, including glass, a cupronickel coin, and an organic polymer. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a bioinspired approach utilizing the melanisation of a catechol and gallol moiety containing merocyanine.

         <title>Iodide Double Perovskites and the Limits of their Structural Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
What determines the stability of iodide double perovskite compounds and our ability to synthesize them? Despite being highly sought after, not a lot is known about this rare compositional family. We present the single crystal X&#8208;ray structures of two iodide double perovskites containing small trivalent ions, and employ design rules for perovskites, coupled with electronic structure calculations, to understand stability limits.







Abstract
While halide double perovskites A2M(I)M(III)X6 have attracted significant attention, examples involving iodides are rare. We examine the limits of the structural stability of iodide double perovskites, presenting the synthesis and single&#8208;crystal structures of Cs2NaScI6 and Cs2NaYI6. Bypassing the common expectation that iodides have small band gaps, these compounds display optical gaps of 3.10&#8197;eV [M(III)&#8201;=&#8201;Sc] and 3.65&#8197;eV [M(III)&#8201;=&#8201;Y]. Cs2NaScI6 is the only iodide double perovskite to exhibit a cubic crystal structure at room temperature. Density functional theory&#8208;based electronic structure calculations help understand the role of competing Cs3M(III)2I9 (3&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;9) phases and provide possible reasons for why iodide double perovskites based around In(III), Sb(III) and Bi(III) cations have proved elusive. We confirm design rules for halide double perovskites based around concepts of the tolerance factor and the radius ratio of the smaller, trivalent ion, but also point to situations such as what is observed for Cs2NaScI6 where a double perovskite can be trapped in a metastable structure.

         <title>Basics and Advances of Manganese&#8208;Based Cathode Materials for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the recent achievements in manganese oxides with different polymorphs and nanostructures as potential cathode materials for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). In particular, various strategies, including phase/defect engineering, element doping, and coupling with carbon materials or conducting polymers, are summarized and discussed in detail. The challenges and suggestions for the development of manganese oxides for ZIBs are put forward.







Abstract
It is greatly crucial to develop low&#8208;cost energy storage candidates with high safety and stability to replace alkali metal systems for a sustainable future. Recently, aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have received tremendous interest owing to their low cost, high safety, wide oxidation states, and sophisticated fabrication process. Nanostructured manganese (Mn)&#8208;based oxides in different polymorphs are the potential cathode materials for the widespread application of ZIBs. However, Mn&#8208;based oxide materials suffer from several drawbacks, such as low electronic/ionic conductivity and poor cycling performance. To overcome these issues, various structural modification strategies have been adopted to enhance their electrochemical activity, including phase/defect engineering, doping with foreign atoms (e.&#8201;g., metal and/or nonmetal atoms), and coupling with carbon materials or conducting polymers. Herein, this review targets to summarize the advantages and disadvantages of the above&#8208;mentioned strategies to improve the electrochemical performance of the cathodic part of ZIBs. The challenges and suggestions for the development of manganese oxides for ZIBs are put forward.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights that the synthesis of perylene (P) and perylene diimide (PDI) organic linkers, involves their integration into coordination frameworks of different dimensionalities &#8211; i.&#8201;e. 2D and 3D MOFs, and 0D MOCs. Additionally, the review highlights the structure&#8208;property relationships of P/PDI&#8208;based coordination frameworks for potential applications including electrochemical devices, photocatalysis, fluorescence sensing and photothermal conversion.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of materials composed of coordinative interactions between metal ions and organic linkers, encompassing two&#8208;dimensional (2D), and three&#8208;dimensional (3D) architectures. Metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs), a special case of these species, are discrete molecular &#8220;capsules&#8221; with zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) structures. Over the last two decades, MOFs and MOCs composed of organic perylene (P) and perylene diimide (PDI) linkers have gained much attention due to their versatile properties, which can be further enhanced after incorporation into frameworks. This minireview highlights recent progress in the construction and application of P/PDI&#8208;based coordination framework materials. The text offers an overview of the synthesis of P/PDI organic linkers, proceeds to their integration into coordination frameworks of different dimensionalities &#8211; 2D and 3D MOFs, and 0D MOCs, and then explores potential applications. These include sensing, photocatalysis, electrochemical devices and photothermal conversion and focus on the apparent structure&#8208;property relationships. Finally, the challenges and future prospects of P/PDI&#8208;derived coordination frameworks will be addressed.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Two new macrocyclic arenes that showed different structures and photophysical properties were synthesized by a one&#8208;step macrocycle&#8208;to&#8208;macrocycle conversion from carboxylic acid substituted octopus[3]arene. Moreover, both macrocycles had fixed conformations and electron&#8208;rich cavities, which enabled them to effectively complex various nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocyclic guests in solution and the solid state.







Abstract
Two new macrocyclic arenes H1 and H2 were conveniently synthesized by the one&#8208;step reaction of carboxylic acid substituted octopus[3]arene. It was found that H1 was composed of three ethenoanthracene subunits with a rigid hexagonal structure and H2 contained two ethenoanthracene subunits and one anthracene subunit with a rigid house&#8208;shaped structure. Among them, H2 exhibited strong blue fluorescence due to the existence of an anthracene subunit. Moreover, both H1 and H2 showed large and electron&#8208;rich cavities, which enable them to effectively complex different nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocyclic salt guests in solution and the solid state. It was further found that H2 exhibited stronger complexation towards the tested guests than H1 probably due to the stronger charge&#8208;transfer interactions between H2 and the guests.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three&#8208;dimensional confined self&#8208;assembly (3D&#8208;CSA) of block copolymers (BCPs) is a distinctive and robust strategy that can yield colloidal polymer particles boasting ordered internal structures and diverse morphologies. The unique advantage of neutral interface lies in its ability to create anisotropic particles with surface patterns. The resulting unique polymer particles exhibit deformability under swelling, coupled with excellent spreadability and optical properties. These particles can also be used for fabrication of anisotropic nanoobjects or mesoporous particles via disassembly or serving as templates. This review comprehensively outlines the research advancements in neutral interface&#8208;guided 3D&#8208;CSA systems, including surfactant engineering, internal structure control, properties and future possibilities of anisotropic patterned particles.</dc:description>

         <title>Quadruple stimuli&#8208;responsive behaviour of acylhydrazone crystals: Mechanical, Photomechanical, Thermomechanical, and Optical Waveguide Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As society advances, the demand for high&#8208;performance crystal materials with versatile stimuli&#8208;responsive capabilities has increased. However, there remains a notable shortage of simple molecular crystals that exhibit stable and swift responses to various stimuli. In this study, we synthesized a novel acylhydrazone crystal by integrating benzene&#8208;fused heterocycles and halogens, achieving a crystal material with multiple stimuli&#8208;responsive behaviours. The crystal demonstrates good mechanical flexibility, capable of with standing a strain of 2.3% under applying mechanical force and recovering its original shape after force removal. Crystal structure analysis reveals this property is due to the strong and flexible intermolecular interactions. It also exhibits rapid photomechanical bending away from light source under UV irradiation, which could be attributed to the facile photoisomerization. Moreover, the crystal undergoes significant thermomechanical transitions, including cracking and jumping, upon heating. Additionally, the prepared crystal exhibits passive optical waveguide of red light at 850 nm, which, combining the photomechanical bending, can achieve controllable light output direction. These multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive behaviors make the acylhydrazone crystal a promising candidate for applications in multifunctional sensors, optoelectronic devices, and thermal switches. This work provides a helpful reference for the study of potential crystal material design and functionality of advanced responsive systems.</dc:description>

         <title>A Chalcogenide&#8208;Derived NiFe2O4&#160;as Highly Efficient and Stable Anode for Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing low&#8208;cost, highly active, and durable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrodes is one of the critical scientific issues for anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEM&#8208;WE). Herein, we report a vacancy&#8208;rich and alkali&#8208;stable NiFe2O4&#8208;type electrode (named as NiFeOx&#8208;350&#8208;Ov), derived from the chemical&#8208;vapor deposited precursor NiFeSexSy&#8208;350, as an efficient and robust anode material. The obtained electrode affords current densities of 100 and 500 mA cm&#8722;2 at overpotentials of 245 and 270 mV, respectively, and displays excellent long&#8208;term durability sustaining 1.0 A cm&#8722;2 at least for 1000 h. When coupled with Ni4Mo/MoO2/NF as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst, the resulting platinum group metal (PGM)&#8208;free single&#8208;cell AEM&#8208;WE exhibits a cell voltage of 1.71 V at the current density of 1000 mA cm&#8722;2 at 80 &#176;C and long&#8208;term durability during a current&#8208;cycling test between 0.5 and 1.0 A cm&#8722;2 over 150 h at 60 &#176;C.

         <title>Synthesis of polysubstituted vinyl sulfones by direct C&#8208;S cross&#8208;coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vinyl sulfones are valued for their unique chemical properties and bioactivity, but creating a wide range of different analogs remains a challenge. To address this limitation, we have developed a novel approach that facilitates the synthesis of polysubstituted vinyl sulfones. This method utilizes the dual functionality of NIS as a promoter that enables sulfonation and elimination in the synthesis of vinyl sulfones. We used the broad applicability, efficiency, selectivity, and functional group tolerance of this approach to synthesize more than 70 examples. Additionally, competition experiments have provided insights into the reactivity and selectivity of the transient sulfonyl radical towards various C&#8208;C multiple bonds. Herein, we describe using this mild protocol in the late&#8208;stage vinyl sulfonation of complex molecules to simplify the synthesis of specific targets and enable the modification of complex natural products and advanced materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Recovery of Berry Natural Products Using Pyrene&#8208;Based MOF Solid Phase Extraction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Recovery of berry natural products (BNPs) by solid&#8208;phase extraction (SPE) using pyrene&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) Al&#8208;PyrMOF and Zn&#8208;NU&#8208;1000. The success of MOF&#8208;SPE was evaluated by their ability to capture and desorb BNPs at elevated concentration.







Abstract
This work introduces a novel method of recovering bioactive berry natural products (BNPs) using solid phase extraction with metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOF&#8208;SPE). Two pyrene&#8208;based MOFs with different structural topologies, Al&#8208;PyrMOF and Zr&#8208;NU&#8208;1000, were evaluated for their ability to capture and desorb BNPs, including ellagic acid, quercetin, gallic acid, and p&#8208;coumaric acid. Time&#8208;dependent BNP uptake via dispersive SPE revealed that NU&#8208;1000 outperformed Al&#8208;PyrMOF in capturing all BNPs. Our findings show NU&#8208;1000 demonstrated a higher and more consistent BNP capture profile, achieving over 90&#8201;% capture of all BNPs within 36&#8197;h, with only a 9&#8201;% variation between the most and least effectively captured BNPs. In contrast, Al&#8208;PyrMOF, displayed a staggered uptake profile, with a significant 53&#8201;% difference in capture efficiency between the most and least effectively captured BNP. However, when a BNP mixture was used at a loading concentration of 50&#8197;&#956;g/mL, Al&#8208;PyrMOF outperformed NU&#8208;1000, capturing over 70&#8201;% of all BNPs.

     alt="Recovery of Berry Natural Products Using Pyrene-Based MOF Solid Phase Extraction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recovery of berry natural products (BNPs) by solid-phase extraction (SPE) using pyrene-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) Al-PyrMOF and Zn-NU-1000. The success of MOF-SPE was evaluated by their ability to capture and desorb BNPs at elevated concentration.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work introduces a novel method of recovering bioactive berry natural products (BNPs) using solid phase extraction with metal-organic frameworks (MOF-SPE). Two pyrene-based MOFs with different structural topologies, Al-PyrMOF and Zr-NU-1000, were evaluated for their ability to capture and desorb BNPs, including ellagic acid, quercetin, gallic acid, and p-coumaric acid. Time-dependent BNP uptake via dispersive SPE revealed that NU-1000 outperformed Al-PyrMOF in capturing all BNPs. Our findings show NU-1000 demonstrated a higher and more consistent BNP capture profile, achieving over 90&#8201;% capture of all BNPs within 36&#8197;h, with only a 9&#8201;% variation between the most and least effectively captured BNPs. In contrast, Al-PyrMOF, displayed a staggered uptake profile, with a significant 53&#8201;% difference in capture efficiency between the most and least effectively captured BNP. However, when a BNP mixture was used at a loading concentration of 50&#8197;&#956;g/mL, Al-PyrMOF outperformed NU-1000, capturing over 70&#8201;% of all BNPs. Al-PyrMOF also exhibited improved BNP recovery, with a minimum of two-fold greater amount recovered for all BNPs. Further testing with a BNP mixture at a concentration of 15&#8197;&#956;g/mL demonstrated that Al-PyrMOF efficiently concentrated all BNPs, achieving a maximum extraction factor of 2.71 observed for quercetin. These findings highlight the use of Al-PyrMOF as a MOF-SPE sorbent for recovering bioactive BNPs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) has attracted growing attention over recent years owing to the wide range of applications in organic nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. The quantitative sensitivity of a two&#8208;photon molecular entity is determined by its TPA cross&#8208;section (&#948;TPA). Perylene diimides (PDIs) are excellent n&#8208;type organic semiconductor materials demonstrating distinguished thermal, optical, and chemical stability. Nonetheless, PDIs&#8208;based sca&#64256;olds exhibit poor &#948;TPA &#160;in the NIR&#8208;I region (700&#8208;900 nm) due to the lack of suitable molecular design. Here, two novel star&#8208;shaped PDIs fluorophores, namely PDI&#8208;S and PDI&#8208;Se, were constructed by four periphery S/Se&#8208;fused PDIs connected with bicarbazole core. PDI&#8208;S manifested excellent &#948;TPA of 3775 GM, which are among the highest values reported for PDIs excited in the NIR&#8208;I region.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The potassium aluminyl K[Al(NON)] ([NON]2&#8211; = [O(SiMe2NDipp)2]2&#8211;, Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) reacts with group 14 chloroamidinates E{14}(Am)Cl (E{14} = Ge, Sn, Pb. [Am]&#8211; = [tBuC(NDipp)2]&#8211;) to form (NON)Al&#8211;E{14}(Am) Lewis pairs with unsupported Al&#8211;E{14} bonds, including the first structurally authenticated Al&#8211;Pb bond. Analysis using spectroscopic (NMR, UV&#8208;vis and M&#246;ssbauer for E{14} = Sn), X&#8208;ray diffraction and computational (DFT, QTAIM, TD&#8208;DFT) methods conclude an Al&#8211;E{14} &#963;&#8208;bond derived from a Lewis basic Al and a Lewis acidic tetrylene, with back&#8208;donation from the E{14} &#963;&#8208;orbital lone pair donor NBO to acceptor NBOs on Al derived from s/p&#8208;orbitals. The reaction of the Al&#8211;Ge compound with CO2 forms the dioxocarbene (NON)Al(&#956;&#8208;O2C)Ge(Am), whilst under the same conditions the Al&#8211;Sn compound reacts with additional CO2 to form the carbonate, (NON)Al(&#956;&#8208;CO3)Sn(Am). Addition of ethene to the Al&#8211;E{14} (E{14} = Ge, Sn) compounds introduces an ethylene bridge between the aluminium and group 14 atoms forming a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP). Reaction of the (Al/Ge) FLP with CO2 forms an activation product with new Al&#8211;O and Ge&#8211;C bonds, whilst reaction with iPrN=C=NiPr proceeds with insertion into the Al&#8211;C bond to form an aluminium amidinate.</dc:description>

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Insights on Gas Trapping of Noble Gases in MFU&#8208;4&#8208;Type Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isostructural metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), namely MFU&#8208;4 and MFU&#8208;4&#8208;Br, in which the pore apertures are defined by anionic side ligands (Cl&#8722; and Br&#8722;, respectively), were synthesized and loaded with noble gases. By selecting the type of side ligand, one can fine&#8208;tune the pore aperture size, allowing for precise regulation of the entry and release of gas guests. In this study, we conducted experiments to examine gas loading and release using krypton and xenon as model gases, and we complemented our findings with computational modeling. Remarkably, the loaded gas guests remained trapped inside the pores even after being exposed to air under ambient conditions for extended periods, in some cases for up to several weeks. Therefore, we focused on determining the energy barrier preventing gas release using both theoretical and experimental methods. The results were compared in relation to the types of hosts and guests, providing valuable insights into the gas trapping process in MOFs, as well as programmed gas release in air under ambient conditions. Furthermore, the crystal structure of MFU&#8208;4&#8208;Br was elucidated using the three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction (3DED) technique, and the bulk purity of the sample was subsequently verified through Rietveld refinement.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;organic Framework&#160;(MOF)&#8208;Based Sensors for Mercury (Hg) Detection: Design Strategies and Recent Progress</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Monitoring mercury (Hg) is critical for environmental and public health. Metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based sensors demonstrate the advantage of high sensitivity and rapid response. We summarize the advances of MOF sensors for Hg2+ detection from the perspective of MOF type and role in the sensors. First, we introduce three MOFs used in Hg sensors&#8212;UIO, ZIF, and MIL&#8212;that have demonstrated superior performance. Then, we discuss the specifics of MOF&#8208;based sensors for Hg2+ detection in terms of the recognition and signal elements. Currently, the recognition elements include T&#8208;rich aptamers, noble metal nanoparticles, central metal ions, and organic functional groups inherent to MOFs. Sensors with fluorescence and colorimetric signals are the two main types of optical MOF sensors used for Hg detection. Electrochemical sensors have also been fabricated, but these are less frequently reported, potentially due to the limited conductivity and cycling stability of MOFs. Notably, dual&#8208;signal sensors mitigate background signals interference and enhance the accuracy of Hg2+ detection. Furthermore, to facilitate portability and user&#8208;friendliness, portable devices such as microfluidics, paper&#8208;based devices, and smartphones have been developed for Hg2+ detection, showcasing potential applications. We also address the challenges related to MOF&#8208;based sensors for Hg2+ and future outlook.</dc:description>

         <title>Intersystem Crossing, Photo&#8208;Induced Charge Separation and Regioisomer&#8208;Specific Excited State Dynamics in Fully Rigid Spiro Rhodammine&#8208;Naphthalene/Anthraquinone Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Dyads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We prepared a series fully rigid spiro electron donor&#8208;acceptor orthogonal dyads, with closed form of rhodamine (Rho) as electron donor and naphthalene (Np)/anthraquinone (AQ) as electron acceptor, to access the long&#8208;lived triplet charge separation (3CS) state, via the electron spin control method. We found strong dependency of the photophysical property of the dyads on the amino substitution positions of the Np chromophores in the dyads 1,8&#8208;DaNp&#8208;Rho and 2,3&#8208;DaNp&#8208;Rho. Nanosecond transient absorption (ns&#8208;TA) spectra show the population of the 3LE state (lifetime: 47 &#956;s) for 2,3&#8208;DaNp&#8208;Rho, however, long&#8208;lived 3CS state was observed (&#964;CS = 0.62 &#956;s) for AQ&#8208;Rho, with a CS quantum yield of &#934;CS = 58%. Based on femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) spectra, spin orbit charge transfer ISC (SOCT&#8208;ISC) is proposed to be responsible for the formation of the triplet states. Time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectra of AQ&#8208;Rho indicate the presence of two states, a 3LE state with zero field splitting (ZFS) D parameter of 1400 MHz and E parameter of &#8208;410 MHz, formed via radical pair ISC (RP&#8208;ISC) and SOCT&#8208;ISC mechanism; and a 3CS state with the electron spin&#8208;spin interaction in the regime of spin&#8208;correlated radical pair (SCRP)</dc:description>

Time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectra of AQ-Rho indicate the presence of two states, a 3LE state with zero field splitting (ZFS) D parameter of 1400 MHz and E parameter of -410 MHz, formed via radical pair ISC (RP-ISC) and SOCT-ISC mechanism; and a 3CS state with the electron spin-spin interaction in the regime of spin-correlated radical pair (SCRP)&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regulating Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence of Organic Luminophores through Stepwise Stabilization by Coordination and In&#8208;Situ Precipitation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing efficiency and long&#8208;lived room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials through straightforward methods is highly desired. In this work, a stepwise stabilization strategy was proposed by the coordination and in&#8208;situ precipitation reactions among organic precursors, inorganic cation and anions, producing room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence materials with high emission efficiency (phosphorescence quantum yield of 45%). Structural and photophysical characterizations revealed the coordination reaction reduced the energy gaps between singlet and triplet states and stabilized the excited states of the guest molecules. The in&#8208;situ precipitation reaction produced a solid matrix, which provided isolated environments for protecting the excitons from quenching. The applications of RTP materials in information encryption were demonstrated. The presented results provided a new clue for producing RTP materials, and extended their applications in wide fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Transparent Nonlinear Optical Phosphates: A New Alternative to Conventional Borates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deep ultraviolet (DUV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals with balanced performance are crucial for extending laser wavelengths into the DUV region, essential for various laser applications. However, developing ideal DUV crystals is challenging due to stringent requirements: strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response, short cut&#8208;off wavelength, and effective phase&#8208;matching behavior. DUV NLO borates, which feature &#960;&#8208;conjugated groups, have garnered attention for their higher SHG coefficients compared to phosphates. However, phosphates typically show short UV cut&#8208;off edges due to the large HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap (approximately 9.6 eV) of the [PO&#8324;] units. To enhance the SHG effect while maintaining DUV transparency in phosphates, several strategies have been proposed: 1) using distorted polymerized P&#8722;O groups like isolated C&#8321;&#8208;[P&#8323;O&#8321;&#8320;]&#8309;&#8315; and [P&#8322;O&#8327;]&#8308;&#8315;; 2) aligning isolated [PO&#8324;]&#179;&#8315; tetrahedra along the polar screw axis; 3) introducing additional NLO&#8208;active units; and 4) exploring new units derived from [PO&#8324;]&#179;&#8315;, such as [PO&#8323;F]&#178;&#8315; tetrahedra. These strategies have led to the successful development of various non&#8208;centrosymmetric phosphates, highlighting their potential as DUV NLO candidates. This review explores the relationship between their crystal structures and DUV NLO performance, and proposes future directions for developing ideal DUV NLO materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Basic&#8208;functionalized Ionic Porous Organic Polymers: Triple Roles in One for Highly Efficient and Recyclable Carboxylative Cyclization of CO2 under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The transformation of carbon dioxide (CO2) into high&#8208;value chemicals is a significant step towards achieving the goal of "carbon neutrality". &#945;&#8208;methylene cyclic carbonate, as an intermediate for the synthesis of many important organic compounds, is widely employed in industrial productions. In this work, a series of ionic porous organic polymers (IPOPs) with different basic&#8208;functionalized anions were successfully synthesized and adjusted to have certain BET surface areas and high contents of ion sites by post&#8208;modification. These basic&#8208;functionalized IPOPs could exhibit excellent catalytic performance for carboxylative cyclization of CO2 at 30 oC and 1 bar in presence of silver salts, eliminating the use of extra organic bases. In the whole catalytic reaction, the basic&#8208;functionalized anions could play triple roles: enriching CO2 for further transformation, activating the hydroxyl groups of substrates to improve the catalytic performance, while coordinating with Ag atom to stabilize and regenerate catalyst. Notably, the catalytic system of DCX&#8208;4&#8208;Tet/Ag2O exhibited excellent recyclability, and the yield of &#945;&#8208;alkylidene cyclic carbonate was well maintained at 99% after 5 cycles. To the best of our knowledge, the catalytic system was the first example of basic&#8208;functionalized IPOPs that played multiple roles for highly efficient CO2 cyclization under mild conditions without any extra organic bases.</dc:description>

         <title>Meso&#8208;&#946; Monofused Porphyrins: Synthesis, Structural, Spectral, Electrochemical and DFT Studies and Their Efficient Third&#8208;Order Nonlinear Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three new series of &#946;&#8208;to&#8208;ortho&#8208;phenyl monofused porphyrins, denoted as MMFP(MN)X2 (where MFP = monofused porphyrin, MN = malononitrile and X = H or Br) and MMFP(MN)MB (where MB = mono benzo, M = 2H, Co(II), Cu(II) and Zn(II)) were designed and successfully synthesized. These compounds were&#160;characterized using various spectroscopic techniques and SCXRD analysis. Notably, three of the porphyrins&#160;crystallized&#160; in a triclinic crystal system with a P1&#773; space group. The twist angle values for these structures ranged from 14.03&#176; to 21.35&#176;. The meso&#8208;&#946; peripheral fusion and substituents led to tunable electronic spectral features across the synthesized porphyrins. The first reduction and oxidation potentials of all the investigated porphyrins exhibited significant anodically shift as compared to their parent tetraphenylporphyrins attributed to peripheral fusion and electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents, which collectively led to a reduced HOMO&#8210;LUMO gap. Ultrafast third&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) studies revealed that these monofused porphyrins showed a strong two&#8208;photon absorption coefficient &#160;and effective cross&#8208;section ([[EQUATION]] = 0.03 &#8210; 8.05 &#215; 105 GM) values along with self&#8208;defocusing negative nonlinear refraction behaviour (n2 = (&#8210;) 0.5 &#8210; 5.28 &#215; 10&#8210;16 m2/W). These findings open new avenues for the application of meso&#8208;&#946; fused porphyrins in optical limiters, optical devices and other optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Correlation Between NMR Coupling Constants and &#963;&#8208;Donating Properties of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes and Their Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Is the 1JC&#8208;H coupling constant for protonated carbene a relevant measure of its &#963;&#8208;donation ability? This paper addresses this question by comparing calculated 1JC&#8208;H values with various experimental and theoretical approaches across a broad spectrum of carbene compounds. We examined Arduengo&#8208;type NHCs based on the 2&#8208;imidazolylidene scaffold and many other derivatives with modified frameworks, including carbenes with extended, saturated, or conjugated rings, reduced heteroatom stabilization, alternative heteroatoms, permanently charged carbenes, acyclic carbenes, amidocarbenes, and cyclic amino(alkyl/aryl) carbenes, carbodicarbenes and carbodiphosphoranes. Our findings reveal a nuanced relationship between different parameters associated with &#963;&#8208;interaction, such as 1JC&#8208;H, Huynh electronic parameter (HEP), &#963;&#8208;donation from ETS&#8208;NOCV, and lone pair energy. Notably, the best correlation was observed between 1JC&#8208;H and the ETS&#8208;NOCV method, particularly for mono&#8208; and diaminocarbenes, highlighting the utility of 1JC&#8208;H in comparing &#963;&#8208;donation among structurally similar carbene types. However, the use of 1JC&#8208;H as a universal measure across all carbene classes appears limited, especially when considering carbenes with significantly different structural frameworks. While HEP is less effective for carbenes with diverse structural backbones, our study suggests that 1JC&#8208;H has potential across a broader range of systems. Additionally, the analysis demonstrates that lone pair energy reflects basicity rather than &#963;&#8208;donor ability.</dc:description>

         <title>Parts&#8208;per&#8208;million Level Loading Cyclometalated Ru(II)&#8722;NHC Catalyzed Selective Oxidation of Olefins to Carbonyls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidative cleavage of olefins is a useful reaction in organic synthesis. The most well&#8208;known catalytic system is the osmium based Lemieux&#8211;Johnson catalyst, which generally requires high catalyst loading and tends to suffer from rapid overoxidation to produce the acid predominantly. Hence, the&#160;development of a mild, general, and selective method toward the oxidative cleavage of alkenes to carbonyl compounds is highly desired. In this work, a highly efficient ruthenium&#8208;based catalyst for olefin oxidation has been demonstrated by employing a fused &#960;&#8208;conjugated imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinoxaline (ImQx) based NHC ligand with bidentate C(carbanion)^CNHC motif. Strong C&#8208;donor ligands, paired with a rigid backbone and ruthenium redox activity, provided exceptionally high catalytic activity and a long lifetime for olefin oxidation. Complex showed high catalytic activity and a long lifetime, TONs are several million. The catalyst tolerates numerous functional groups and can be applicable to challenging biomass, natural products, sugar, amino acids, and fatty acid&#8208;derived substrates. Based on kinetic studies, thermodynamic activation parameters, and DFT study, the mechanistic finding demonstrated that [3+2] cycloaddition reaction is the key step in the oxidation process. The use of the&#160;by&#8208;product NaIO3 in the catalytic efficiency has been disclosed for the first time.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular interaction between polymers has been utilized for constructing three&#8208;dimensional polymer structures with unique physical and chemical properties. In this study, we demonstrated a novel supramolecular miktoarm star&#8208;shaped copolymer with a cobalt(II) phthalocyanine (CoPc) core using metal&#8208;ligand coordination. Axial coordination of the terminal pyridyl group of poly(methyl methacrylate) to the CoPc core of 4&#8208;armed star&#8208;shaped polystyrene provided AB4&#8208; and A2B4&#8208;type&#160;&#181;&#8208;stars by stepwise complexation. The spin&#8208;coated polymer films from the mixed solutions of CoPcPS4&#160;and pyPMMA in a 1:1 or 1:2 mass ratio showed phase&#8208;separated nanodomains with smooth surfaces. Superamolecular interactions in polymer systems provide a unique topology for polymers and affect their bulk morphology.</dc:description>

         <title>Metalized Borylene in Boron&#8722;Gold Carbonyl Complexes: Infrared Spectra and Theoretical Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Borylenes (:B&#8211;R), built on a single B&#8211;R bond between boron and another nonmetallic atom or group,&#160;are a heated subject of special interest due to their intriguing transition&#8208;metal&#8208;mimicking reactivity, but the relative lack of understanding for the electronic structure and chemical bonding of transition metal borides leads to lingering neglect of metalized borylenes (:B&#8211;M) based on covalent B&#8211;M bonding. Here we use infrared photodissociation spectroscopy in combination with density functional calculations to study the geometric structure and chemical bonding of boron&#8208;gold carbonyl complex cations. The structure and bonding analyses demonstrated that the BAu(CO)3+ and BAu2(CO)4+ complexes can be described as bis&#8208;carbonyl&#8208;trapped borylene adducts. While the metal&#8208;rich BAu3(CO)4+ complex represents an unusual multicenter&#8208;bond&#8208;stabilized borylene cation with excellent &#963;&#8208;acidity and &#960;&#8208;backbonding capability for CO activation, featuring Cs symmetry with a quasi&#8208;T&#8208;shaped BAu3+ core. It is manifested that BAu3+ presents greater amphoteric reactivity and improved stability compared to BAu1,2+ due to the presence of the three&#8208;center&#8208;two&#8208;electron Au&#8211;B&#8211;Au bond. This study discloses a conceptually new platform for accessing reactive metalized borylenes by exploiting the boron&#8208;mediated multicenter&#8208;bond stabilization strategy and using more bench&#8208;stable and ubiquitous metal carbonyl fragments as starting materials, thus providing a broader opportunity for the design of novel chemical structures and catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;situ reduced Cu3N nanocrystals enable high&#8208;efficiency ammonia synthesis and zinc&#8208;nitrate batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) involves an 8&#8208;electron transfer process and competes with the hydrogen evolution reaction process, resulting in lower yields and Faraday efficiency (FE) in the process of NH3 synthesis. Especially, Cu&#8208;based catalysts (Cu0 and Cu+) have been investigated in the field of NO3RR due to the energy levels of d&#8208;orbital and the least unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) &#960;* of nitrate's orbital. Based on the above, we synthesized a Cu&#8208;based compound containing Cu3N (Cu+) through a simple one&#8208;step pyrolysis method, applied it to electrocatalytic NO3RR, and tested the performance of the Zn&#8208;NO3&#8722; battery. Through various characterization analyses, Cu&#8208;based catalysts (Cu+) are the key active sites in reduction reactions, making Cu3N a potential catalyst for ammonia synthesis. The research results indicate the application of Cu3N catalyst in NO3RR shows the best NH3 yield of 173.7 &#956;mol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, with FENH3 reaching 91.0% at &#8722;0.3 V vs. RHE, which is much higher than that of Cu catalyst without N. In addition, the Zn&#8208;NO3&#8722; battery based on Cu3N electrode also exhibits an NH3 yield of 39.8 &#956;mol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, 63.0% FENH3, and a power density of 2.7 mW cm&#8722;2, as well as stable cycling charge&#8208;discharge stability for 5 hours.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report a general remote tribromo&#8208; and trichloromethylation process using CBr4 and CBrCl3 as ready available sources of trihalomethyl radicals. This method operates under mild and metal&#8208;free photocatalyzed conditions and enables the access to &#947;&#8208;trihalomethylated enals with complete regioselectivity in up to 71% isolated yield. Importantly, this protocol is easily adapted to the selective one&#8208;pot synthesis of the corresponding &#947;&#8208;dihalomethylidenated enals in up to 49% overall yield. Mechanistic studies are in favor of a radical chain propagation initiated by an oxidative quenching of the photocatalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Magnetohydrodynamic Enhancement of Biofuel Cell Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biofuel cells have become an interesting alternative for the design of sustainable energy conversion systems with multiple applications ranging from biosensing and bioelectronics to autonomously moving devices. However, as an electrochemical system, their performance is intimately related to mass transport conditions. In this work, the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effect is studied as an easy and straightforward alternative to enhance the performance of a biofuel cell based on the enzymes glucose oxidase (GOx) and bilirubin oxidase (BOD). The synergetic effect between the electric and ionic currents, produced by the enzymatic redox reactions, and a magnetic field orthogonal to the surface of the electrodes, leads to the formation of localized magnetohydrodynamic vortexes. Such an integrated convective regime generates an increase of the bioelectrocatalytic current and its concomitant power output in the presence of the external magnetic field. In addition, by fine&#8208;tuning the spatial arrangement of the anode and cathode, it is possible to benefit from the sum of anodic and cathodic MHD vortexes, leading to an enhanced power output of up to 300%.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We have developed a family of dinuclear complexes using 2,7&#8208;disubstituted 1,8&#8208;naphthalenediol ligands that bind by molecular recognition to two neighboring phosphate diesters of the DNA backbone with the dinuclear CuII and NiII complexes exhibiting a severe cytotoxicity for human cancer cells. To increase the binding affinity, we intended to synthesize the corresponding dinuclear FeIII complex. Surprisingly, we obtained a tetranuclear FeIII perylene&#8208;based complex instead of the expected dinuclear FeIII naphthalene&#8208;based complex. In order to establish a rational and reproducible synthesis, we carefully analyzed this reaction. This revealed a multistep oxidative cascade reaction including the pre&#8208;coordination of FeII ions in the N3&#8208;binding pockets, the Lewis&#8208;acid assisted MOM&#8208;deprotection of the pre&#8208;ligand by the pre&#8208;oriented FeII ions, two oxidative aromatic C&#8208;C coupling reactions, oxidation of the perylene&#8208;based backbone and of FeII to FeIII. The careful analysis of bond lengths, HOMA indices (harmonic oscillation model of aromaticity), FTIR and UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR spectra supported by DFT calculations reveals the presence of an aromatic 18&#8208;electron oxidized perylenequinone ligand backbone. In summary, a multistep cascade reaction involving in total a 10&#8208;electron oxidation has been established for the straight&#8208;forward synthesis of an unprecedented perylenequinone&#8208;based ligand system.</dc:description>

         <title>The Emissive and Electrochemical Properties of Hypervalent Pyridine&#8208;Dipyrrolide Bismuth ComplexesThe Emissive and Electrochemical Properties of Hypervalent Pyridine&#8208;Dipyrrolide Bismuth Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a series of six hypervalent bismuth complexes Bi(R1PDPR2)X bearing ligands characterized by the pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;bis(pyrrolide) (PDP) structural motif. While bismuth holds considerable potential for facilitating efficient intersystem crossing (ISC), reports on phosphorescent molecular bismuth complexes are still scarce and mostly based on systems that exhibit inter&#8209; or intraligand charge transfer character of their optical excitations. Herein, the UV/vis absorptive, luminescent, and electrochemical properties of complexes Bi(R1PDPR2)X are explored, where the substituents R1 and R2, as well as the halide ligand X are varied. These compounds are characterized by an intense HOMO&#174;LUMO transition of mixed ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) and interligand charge transfer (LL&#8217;CT) character, as shown by time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations. At 77 K in a 2&#8208;MeTHF matrix, these compounds exhibit red, long&#8208;lived phosphorescence with lifetimes ranging from 671 to 20 &#181;s. Cyclic voltammetry measurements and TD&#8208;DFT calculations show that the substituents influence HOMO and LUMO energies to almost equal extent, resulting in nearly constant emission wavelengths throughout this series. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies of four of the six complexes exemplify the inherent Lewis acidity of the coordinated Bi3+ ion, in spite of its hypervalency.</dc:description>

         <title>Remarkable effect of stereoisomerism on the Am(III)/Ln(III) solvent extraction. New ligands for highly efficient separation of americium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two novel 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline&#8208;2,9&#8208;diamide ligands were constructed based on 2&#8208;phenylpyrrolidine and obtained as pure diastereomers. These ligands demonstrated advanced properties in liquid&#8208;liquid extraction tests. They revealed high efficiency of americium(III) extraction alongside with the record values of selectivity in the separation of americium from light lanthanides from strongly acidic media. An abrupt increase of extraction efficiency when moving along the lanthanide series from lanthanum to lutetium was observed. The examination of the extraction behavior of pure diastereomeric forms revealed noticeable differences in their selectivity while maintaining the overall extraction trend. The explanation of the discovered patterns was elucidated by a comprehensive study of the ability of the ligands to bind lanthanide nitrates in solutions. All the data collected (UV&#8208;vis and NMR titration, X&#8208;ray analysis of resulting complexes, solvation numbers estimation) were supported by quantum chemical calculation. These data clearly indicated that in case of light lanthanides the formation of 1:1 complexes is most preferable. In the same time, complexes with heavy lanthanides, such as ytterbium and lutetium, exist as ionic pairs which may consist of [L2M]z+ cations counterbalanced by metallates anions, which may result in formation of unusual composition species L2M2 or even L4M5 clusters.</dc:description>

         <title>Orthogonal Functionalization of Oxo&#8208;Graphene Nanoribbons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxo&#8208;graphene nanoribbons (oxo&#8208;GNRs) can be prepared by the oxidative unzipping of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes. We present an orthogonal functionalization method for the functionalization of the rims and the &#960;&#8208;surface, respectively, what is only possible due to the high rim portion in oxo&#8208;GNRs. Thus, in particular X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy could be used to trace reaction to detect marker atoms included in addends. We propose that the reported orthogonal functionalization strategy can also be applied on other oxo&#8208;functionalized carbon materials, such as carbon dots, or reduced graphene oxide flakes.</dc:description>
