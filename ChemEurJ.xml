         <title>Advances on Dual&#8208;Functional Hosts for Polysulfides Conversion and Lithium Plating/Stripping towards Lithium&#8722;Sulfur  Full Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The practical application of lithium&#8722;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries is greatly hindered by the shuttle effect of dissolved polysulfides in the sulfur cathode and the severe dendritic growth in the lithium anode. Adopting one type of effective host with dual&#8208;functions including both inhibiting polysulfide dissolution and regulating Li plating/stripping, is recently an emerging&#160;research highlight in Li&#8722;S battery. This review focuses on such dual&#8208;functional hosts and systematically summarizes the recent research progress and application scenarios. Firstly, this review briefly describes the stubborn issues in Li&#8722;S battery operations and the sophisticated counter measurements over the challenges by dual&#8208;functional behaviors. Then, the latest advances on dual&#8208;functional hosts for both cathode and anode in Li&#8722;S full cells are catalogued as species, including metal chalcogenides, metal carbides, metal nitrides, heterojunctions, and the possible mechanisms during the process. Besides, we also outlined the theoretical calculation tools for the dual&#8208;functional host based on the first principles. Finally, several sound perspectives are also rationally proposed for fundamental research and practical development as guidelines.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing Phosphorus Nitrides up to the Megabar Regime: Synthesis of &#945;&#8242;&#8208;P3N5, &#948;&#8208;P3N5 and PN2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 62, November 7, 2022. </description>

Phase in, phase out: Investigations of the phosphorus&#8211;nitrogen system in a laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cell resulted in the synthesis of new &#948;&#8208;P3N5 and PN2 phases at 72 and 134&#8197;GPa, respectively. Their structures are composed of PN6 octahedra. Upon decompression, &#948;&#8208;P3N5 transforms into the novel &#945;&#8242;&#8208;P3N5 solid that is stable under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Non&#8208;metal nitrides are an exciting field of chemistry, featuring a significant number of compounds that can possess outstanding material properties. These properties mainly rely on maximizing the number of strong covalent bonds, with crosslinked XN6 octahedra frameworks being particularly attractive. In this study, the phosphorus&#8211;nitrogen system was studied up to 137&#8197;GPa in laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cells, and three previously unobserved phases were synthesized and characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy measurements and density functional theory calculations. &#948;&#8208;P3N5 and PN2 were found to form at 72 and 134&#8197;GPa, respectively, and both feature dense 3D networks of the so far elusive PN6 units. The two compounds are ultra&#8208;incompressible, having a bulk modulus of K0=322&#8197;GPa for &#948;&#8208;P3N5 and 339&#8197;GPa for PN2. Upon decompression below 7&#8197;GPa, &#948;&#8208;P3N5 undergoes a transformation into a novel &#945;&#8242;&#8208;P3N5 solid, stable at ambient conditions, that has a unique structure type based on PN4 tetrahedra. The formation of &#945;&#8242;&#8208;P3N5 underlines that a phase space otherwise inaccessible can be explored through materials formed under high pressure.

         <title>Proteophenes &#8211; Amino Acid Functionalized Thiophene&#8208;based Fluorescent Ligands for Visualization of Protein Deposits in Tissue Sections with Alzheimer's Disease Pathology</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 62, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proteophenes. A palette of fluorescent thiophene&#8208;based ligands with distinct amino acid side&#8208;chain functionalities along the conjugated backbone was synthesized. Ligands with specific side&#8208;chain functionalities displayed selectivity towards distinct protein aggregates in tissue sections with Alzheimer's disease pathology. We foresee that proteophenes will significantly expand the toolbox of ligands for fluorescent assignment of disease&#8208;associated protein aggregates.







Abstract
Protein deposits composed of specific proteins or peptides are associated with several neurodegenerative diseases and fluorescent ligands able to detect these pathological hallmarks are vital. Here, we report the synthesis of a class of thiophene&#8208;based ligands, denoted proteophenes, with different amino acid side&#8208;chain functionalities along the conjugated backbone, which display selectivity towards specific disease&#8208;associated protein aggregates in tissue sections with Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. The selectivity of the ligands towards AD associated pathological hallmarks, such as aggregates of the amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptide or tau filamentous inclusions, was highly dependent on the chemical nature of the amino acid functionality, as well as on the location of the functionality along the pentameric thiophene backbone. Finally, the concept of synthesizing donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor proteophenes with distinct photophysical properties was shown. Our findings provide the structural and functional basis for the development of new thiophene&#8208;based ligands that can be utilized for optical assignment of different aggregated proteinaceous species in tissue sections.

         <title>Multigram Synthesis of a Combustion&#8208;Relevant &#948;&#8208;Ketohydroperoxide through Sulfonylhydrazine Substitution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 62, November 7, 2022. </description>

Combustion time! The synthesis of a &#948;&#8208;ketohydroperoxide is described, addressing the compatibilities of ketones and hydroperoxides in these elusive combustion&#8208;relevant species. The hydroperoxide is installed through sulfonylhydrazine substitution, in which it is found that 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane is an advantageous medium for the transformation. The synthesis is scalable and safe, providing material for future chemical kinetics studies.







Abstract
A synthesis of a &#948;&#8208;ketohydroperoxide is described, addressing potential functional&#8208;group compatibilities in these elusive species relevant to combustion and atmospheric chemistries. The hydroperoxide is installed via sulfonylhydrazine substitution, which was found to be more effective than displacement of secondary halides. As part of this protocol, it was observed that 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane is an advantageous medium for the reaction, avoiding the formation of a tetrahydrofuran hydroperoxide side product. This discovery facilitated the multigram synthesis (6&#8197;steps, 41&#8201;% yield overall) and discrete characterization of the target &#948;&#8208;ketohydroperoxide.

The synthesis of a &#948;-ketohydroperoxide is described, addressing the compatibilities of ketones and hydroperoxides in these elusive combustion-relevant species. The hydroperoxide is installed through sulfonylhydrazine substitution, in which it is found that 1,2-dimethoxyethane is an advantageous medium for the transformation. The synthesis is scalable and safe, providing material for future chemical kinetics studies.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A synthesis of a &#948;-ketohydroperoxide is described, addressing potential functional-group compatibilities in these elusive species relevant to combustion and atmospheric chemistries. The hydroperoxide is installed via sulfonylhydrazine substitution, which was found to be more effective than displacement of secondary halides. As part of this protocol, it was observed that 1,2-dimethoxyethane is an advantageous medium for the reaction, avoiding the formation of a tetrahydrofuran hydroperoxide side product. This discovery facilitated the multigram synthesis (6&#8197;steps, 41&#8201;% yield overall) and discrete characterization of the target &#948;-ketohydroperoxide.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Stereocontrol: We have studied the enantioselective transannular aminohalogenation of unsaturated medium&#8208;sized cyclic benzosulfonamides by using both chiral Br&#248;nsted acid and phase&#8208;transfer catalysis. The mechanism of the reaction was also studied by using computational tools; we observed that the key step for stereocontrol involves the participation of an interconverting planar chiral conformer of the nine&#8208;membered cyclic starting material







Abstract
We have studied the enantioselective transannular aminohalogenation reaction of unsaturated medium&#8208;sized cyclic benzosulfonamides by using both chiral Br&#248;nsted acid and phase&#8208;transfer catalysis. Under optimized conditions, a variety of bicyclic adducts can be obtained with good yields and high enantioselectivities. The mechanism of the reaction was also studied by using computational tools; we observed that the reaction involves the participation of a conformer of the nine&#8208;membered cyclic substrate with planar chirality in which the stereochemical outcome is controlled by the relative reactivity of the two pseudorotational enantiomers when interacting with the chiral catalyst.

         <title>Two Tags in One Probe: Combining Fluorescence&#8208; and Biotin&#8208;based Detection of the Trypanosomal Cysteine Protease Rhodesain</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 62, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly potent, bimodal activity&#8208;based probe for the therapeutically relevant cysteine protease rhodesain was developed. We utilized two different access points at the coumarin fluorophore for incorporation of the rhodesain inhibitor part and the biotin affinity label. The two reporter tags were employed for on&#8208;blot chemiluminescence detection and affinity purification as well as post&#8208;labeling quantification of the target protein by size exclusion chromatography with fluorescence detection.







Abstract
Rhodesain is the major cysteine protease of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei and a therapeutic target for sleeping sickness, a fatal neglected tropical disease. We designed, synthesized and characterized a bimodal activity&#8208;based probe that binds to and inactivates rhodesain. This probe exhibited an irreversible mode of action and extraordinary potency for the target protease with a kinac/Ki value of 37,000&#8197;M&#8722;1s&#8722;1. Two reporter tags, a fluorescent coumarin moiety and a biotin affinity label, were incorporated into the probe and enabled highly sensitive detection of rhodesain in a complex proteome by in&#8208;gel fluorescence and on&#8208;blot chemiluminescence. Furthermore, the probe was employed for microseparation and quantification of rhodesain and for inhibitor screening using a competition assay. The developed bimodal rhodesain probe represents a new proteomic tool for studying Trypanosoma pathobiochemistry and antitrypanosomal drug discovery.

         <title>Metalloenzyme&#8208;Mediated Thiol&#8208;Yne Addition Towards Photoisomerizable Fluorescent Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 62, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regioselective metalloenzyme&#8208;directed synthesis of a vinyl sulfide&#8208;based inhibitor, which has shown to be involved in an unexpected Z to E photoisomerization process, is reported. Tuning of the spectral features guided by theoretical studies revealed structural modifications for effective bidirectional photoconversion of thermally bistable vinyl sulfide diastereoisomers, while maintaining the high biological activity of the parent inhibitor.







Abstract
Proteins are able to irreversibly assemble biologically active ligands from building blocks bearing complementary reactive functions due their spatial proximity, through a kinetic target&#8208;guided synthetic process (also named in&#8197;situ click chemistry). Although linkages thus formed are mostly passive, some of them have shown to significantly contribute to the protein binding through for instance hydrogen bonding and stacking interactions. Biocompatible reactions and click chemistry are a formidable source of inspiration for developing such new protein&#8208;directed ligations. This study reports a proximity&#8208;induced thiol&#8208;yne synthesis of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Not only this example widens the arsenal of kinetic target&#8208;guided synthesis (KTGS) eligible reactions, but the obtained product displayed unsuspected photophysical properties. The corresponding vinyl sulfide linkage conjugated to a coumarin core proved to be engaged in a monodirectional Z to E photoisomerization process. Further investigations guided by theoretical calculations showed that fine&#8208;tuning of the nature of the substituents on the coumarin moiety allows to obtain a bidirectional photochemical process, thus discovering a new photoswitching moiety, displaying moreover fluorescence properties. Due to the spectral tunability of coumarin derivatives, this work should open new opportunities for the design of vinyl sulfide&#8208;based photoswitch systems with modular photophysical properties.

A chiral bis(phosphine) monooxide (BPMO) derived from a C2&#8208;symmetric bis(phosphine) ligand does magic to the copper&#8208;catalyzed conjugate borylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted cyclobutenones. Yields and levels of stereoselection, especially enantioselectivity, are exceedingly high (see scheme).







Abstract
Chiral bis(phosphine) monooxides (BPMOs) derived from C2&#8208;symmetric bis(phosphines) have been found to induce superior levels of enantioselection in copper&#8208;catalyzed conjugate borylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted cyclobutenones. More precisely, enantiomeric excesses as well as chemical yields are exceedingly high with (R,R)&#8208;Bozphos as the chiral ligand while these values are low with parent (R,R)&#8208;Me&#8208;Duphos. A similar yet less pronounced effect was seen in the corresponding 1,6&#8208;addition to para&#8208;quinone methides.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 62, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cage&#8208;shaped borate 3aB having pyrenylmethyl groups was synthesized. The obtained 3aB functioned as a photoactivated Lewis acid catalyst. The photoactivation originates from the deformation of the cage&#8208;shaped scaffold driven by intramolecular excimer formations of the pyrenes, allowing the catalytic O&#8208;glycosylation using glycosyl fluorides to proceed with a high efficiency.







Abstract
We describe the synthesis and characterization of a photoactivated boron&#8208;based Lewis acid catalyst based on a cage&#8208;shaped triphenolic ligand with three pyrenylmethyl moieties. The obtained cage&#8208;shaped borate functioned as a photoactivated Lewis acid catalyst thanks to the flexible three pyrenylmethyl moieties. The deformation of the cage&#8208;shaped scaffold driven by intramolecular excimer formations of the pyrenes is a critical factor in realizing the photoactivation. Mannich&#8208;type reactions and glycosylations significantly were accelerated under 370&#8197;nm light irradiations. It is noteworthy that various glycosyl fluorides, which are not easily activated in photocatalytic systems due to their high C&#8722;F bond stability, are activated by the photoimproved catalytic activity of the catalyst.

         <title>Bimetallic Ruthenium Nitrosyl Complexes with Enhanced Two&#8208;Photon Absorption Properties for Nitric Oxide Delivery</title>

Nitric oxide delivery: A series of bimetallic RuNO complexes with quadrupolar electronic structures exhibit TPA cross&#8208;section up to 1523&#8197;GM under irradiation at &#955;=700&#8197;nm, in the therapeutic window of transparency of biological tissues. The biologically active nitric oxide radical (NO&#8901;) is released in any case.







Abstract
One monometallic and three bimetallic ruthenium nitrosyl (RuNO) complexes are presented and fully characterized in reference to a parent monometallic complex of formula [FTRu(bpy)(NO)]3+, where FT is a fluorenyl&#8208;substituted terpyridine ligand, and bpy the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine. These new complexes are built with the new ligands FFT, TFT, TFFT, and TF&#8208;CC&#8208;TF (where an alkyne C&#8801;C group is inserted between two fluorenes). The crystal structures of the bis&#8208;RuNO2 and bis&#8208;RuNO complexes built from the TFT ligand are presented. The evolution of the spectroscopic features (intensities and energies) along the series, at one&#8208;photon absorption (OPA) correlates well with the TD&#8208;DFT computations. A spectacular effect is observed at two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) with a large enhancement of the molecular cross&#8208;section (&#963;TPA), in the bimetallic species. In the best case, &#963;TPA is equal to 1523&#177;98&#8197;GM at 700&#8197;nm, in the therapeutic window of transparency of biological tissues. All compounds are capable of releasing NO&#8901; under irradiation, which leads to promising applications in TPA&#8208;based drug delivery.

         <title>A Macrocyclic Furan with Accessible Oxidation States: Switching Between Aromatic and Antiaromatic Global Ring Currents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 62, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first macrocyclic furan with accessible oxidation states was synthesized using a post&#8208;macrocyclization approach. It exhibits low oxidation potentials, and switching between antiaromatic and aromatic global ring currents upon oxidation.







Abstract
Macrocyclic furans are predicted to switch between global aromaticity and antiaromaticity, depending on their oxidation states. However, the macrocyclic furans reported to date are stabilized by electron withdrawing groups, which result in inaccessible oxidation states. To circumvent this problem, a post&#8208;macrocyclization approach was applied to introduce methylene&#8208;substituted macrocyclic furans, which display an extremely low oxidation potential of &#8722;0.23 vs. Fc/Fc+, and are partially oxidized in ambient conditions. Additional oxidation to the dication results in aromaticity switching to a global 30&#960;e&#8722; aromatic state, as indicated by the formation of a strong diatropic current observed in the 1H&#8197;NMR spectrum. NICS and ACID calculations support this trend and provide evidence for a different pathway for the global current in the neutral and dicationic states. According to these findings, macrocyclic furans can be rendered as promising p&#8208;type materials with stable oxidation states.

         <title>Supramolecular Architecture of an Amphiphilic Amino Alcohol as a Versatile Chiral Environment for Stereocontrolled Photoreaction of Various Anthracenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 62, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular architecture of an amphiphilic amino alcohol serves as unprecedentedly versatile chiral environment, which can efficiently control the stereochemistry of the self&#8208;photocyclodimerization of various anthracenes (71&#8211;98&#8201;% regio ratio, 76&#8211;86&#8201;% ee) as well as the cross&#8208;photocyclodimerization between two anthracenes (58&#8201;% chemo ratio, 83&#8201;% regio ratio, 90&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
The photocyclodimerization of 2&#8208;anthracenecarboxylic acid has been extensively studied as a model reaction of asymmetric photochemistry. So far, numerous chiral environments have been employed to control this photoreaction, while the scope of photoreactants has been limited only to 2&#8208;anthracenecarboxylic acid and its simple esters and amides. Here, we developed a systematic series of photoreactants (2&#8201;a&#8211;d) by introducing various substituents to 2&#8208;anthracenecarboxylic acid, which showed different reactivities and selectivities depending on the substituents. By using the photoreactants 2&#8201;a&#8211;d, we evaluated the performance of a chiral environment composed of an amphiphilic amino alcohol (1), where the photocyclodimerization of 2&#8201;a&#8211;d generally proceeded in excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities (71&#8211;98&#8201;% regio ratio, 76&#8211;86&#8201;% ee). Furthermore, by reacting 2&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b together in the chiral environment of 1, we succeeded in the first stereocontrolled cross&#8208;photocyclodimerization between two prochiral anthracenes (58&#8201;% chemo ratio, 83&#8201;% regio ratio, 90&#8201;% ee).

         <title>Phosphine&#8208;Functionalized Syndiotactic Polystyrenes: Synthesis and Application to Immobilization of Transition Metal Nanoparticle Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 62, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel phosphine&#8208;functionalized syndiotactic polystyrenes composed of o&#8208;diphenylphosphinostyrene and styrene alternating copolymer block and syndiotactic polystyrene block prepared by the copolymerization of o&#8208;diphenylphosphinostyrene with styrene using (C5Me4SiMe3)Sc(CH2C6H4NMe2&#8208;o)2 showed not only thermal stability and chemical (solvent) resistance, but also excellent performance of immobilization of transition metal nanoparticle catalysts.







Abstract
The precise control of monomer sequence and stereochemistry in copolymerization is of much interest and importance for the synthesis of high performance materials, but studies toward this goal have met with only limited success to date. The coordination polymerization of diphenylphosphinostyrene (p&#8208;StPPh2 and o&#8208;StPPh2) and its copolymerization with styrene (St) by (C5Me4SiMe3)Sc(CH2C6H4NMe2&#8208;o)2 have been achieved for the first time to afford a new series of phosphine functionalized syndiotactic polystyrene. By the design of the polymer structure, the copolymer of o&#8208;StPPh2 and St (poly(o&#8208;StPPh2&#8208;alt&#8208;St)&#8208;b&#8208;sPS) containing o&#8208;StPPh2 and St atactic alternating copolymer block and syndiotactic polystyrene block (sPS) showed excellent thermal stability and chemical resistance. The simple combination of the triphenylphosphine and syndiotactic polystyrene realized the stable immobilization of metal nanoparticles to afford highly robust metal@poly(o&#8208;StPPh2&#8208;alt&#8208;St)&#8208;b&#8208;sPS nanocatalysts at high temperature and various atmospheres. The Cu@poly(o&#8208;StPPh2&#8208;alt&#8208;St)&#8208;b&#8208;sPS catalyst can serve as a highly efficient heterogeneous catalyst for the synthesis of quinoline derivatives by acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of o&#8208;aminobenzylalcohol with ketones.

&lt;p&gt;A novel phosphine-functionalized syndiotactic polystyrenes composed of &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-diphenylphosphinostyrene and styrene alternating copolymer block and syndiotactic polystyrene block prepared by the copolymerization of &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-diphenylphosphinostyrene with styrene using (C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Me&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)Sc(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;NMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; showed not only thermal stability and chemical (solvent) resistance, but also excellent performance of immobilization of transition metal nanoparticle catalysts.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The precise control of monomer sequence and stereochemistry in copolymerization is of much interest and importance for the synthesis of high performance materials, but studies toward this goal have met with only limited success to date. The coordination polymerization of diphenylphosphinostyrene (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-StPPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-StPPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and its copolymerization with styrene (St) by (C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Me&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)Sc(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;NMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; have been achieved for the first time to afford a new series of phosphine functionalized syndiotactic polystyrene. By the design of the polymer structure, the copolymer of &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-StPPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and St (poly(&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-StPPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-&lt;i&gt;alt&lt;/i&gt;-St)-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;PS) containing &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-StPPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and St atactic alternating copolymer block and syndiotactic polystyrene block (&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;PS) showed excellent thermal stability and chemical resistance.

         <title>Directing the Self&#8208;Assembly of Aromatic Foldamer Helices using Acridine Appendages and Metal Coordination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 62, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromatic foldamers helices constitute convenient rigid scaffolds but rarely form ordered arrays upon self&#8208;assembly or in crystals. We show that placing acridine appendages at defined position at the surface of aromatic helices guide their organization in the solid state to form discrete dimers or 1D arrays. Furthermore, metal&#8208;coordination at the acridine units of the same compounds drives self&#8208;assembly in solution.







Abstract
Folded molecules provide complex interaction interfaces amenable to sophisticated self&#8208;assembly motifs. Because of their high conformational stability, aromatic foldamers constitute suitable candidates for the rational elaboration of self&#8208;assembled architectures. Several multiturn helical aromatic oligoamides have been synthesized that possess arrays of acridine appendages pointing in one or two directions. The acridine units were shown to direct self&#8208;assembly in the solid state via aromatic stacking leading to recurrent helix&#8208;helix association patterns under the form of discrete dimers or extended arrays. In the presence of Pd(II), metal coordination of the acridine units overwhelms other forces and generates new metal&#8208;mediated multihelical self&#8208;assemblies, including macrocycles. These observations demonstrate simple access to different types of foldamer&#8208;containing architectures, ranging from discrete objects to 1D and, by extension, 2D and 3D arrays.

         <title>Dehydrocoupling Polymerization: Poly(silylether) Synthesis by Using an Iron &#946;&#8208;Diketiminate Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 62, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient iron catalyzed method for the formation of poly(silylether)s has been developed, where the only by&#8208;product of the reaction is hydrogen gas. Fourteen different polymers have been prepared, which show a range of different thermal properties. Insight into the reaction, which proceeds via a condensation polymerization mechanism is provided.







Abstract
We describe the iron&#8208;catalyzed polymerizations of diol and silane monomers to obtain fourteen different poly(silylether) products with number average molecular weights (Mn) up to 36.3&#8197;kDa. The polymerization reactions developed in this study are operationally simple and applicable to 1&#176; and 2&#176; silane monomer substrates and a range of benzylic and aliphatic diol substrates as well as one polyol example. The polymers were characterized by IR spectroscopy, DSC and TGA and, where solubility allowed, 1H, 13C{1H}, 29Si{1H} NMR spectroscopies, GPC and MALDI&#8208;TOF were also employed. The materials obtained displayed low Tg values (&#8722;70.6 to 19.1&#8201;&#176;C) and were stable upon heating up to T&#8211;5%,Ar 421.6&#8201;&#176;C. A trend in T&#8211;5%,Ar was observed whereby use of a 2&#176; silane leads to higher T&#8211;5%,Ar compared to those obtained using a 1&#176; silane. Reaction monitoring was undertaken by in situ gas evolution studies coupled with GPC analysis to follow the progression of chain&#8208;length growth which confirmed a condensation polymerization&#8208;type mechanism.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling of Thioesters and Organomanganese Reagents
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 62, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article discloses the development of an iron(III)&#8208;catalyzed coupling of thioesters with aliphatic organomanganese reagents. The good functional group tolerance resulted in successful transformation of a range of thioesters, including biologically relevant compounds. The presence of accessible &#946;&#8208;hydrogen atom in the organomanganese reagent seems crucial for an effective catalyst activation. The liberated thiolate stabilizes the generated alkylferrate(II) species.







Abstract
We report a Fukuyama&#8208;type coupling of thioesters with aliphatic organomanganese reagents utilizing a cheap and easily available iron(III) precatalyst. The reactions exhibit a wide tolerance of solvents and functional groups, allowing for the conversion of thioesters derived from natural products and pharmaceutical compounds. A strong steric impact from each reaction component (carboxylic moiety, thiol substituent and manganese reagent) was displayed, which enabled regioselective transformation of dithioesters. Mechanistic investigations showed that the released thiolate does not act as a mere spectator ligand, but rather positively influences the stability of intermediate alkyl(II)ferrates.

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Investigation of an Azaoxyallyl Cation&#8208;Templated Intramolecular Aryl Amination Leading to Oxindole Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 62, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detailed investigation on the reactivity of &#945;&#8208;arylated azaoxyallyl cation undergoing intramolecular nucleophilic aryl&#8208;amination under catalyst&#8208;free conditions is presented. Azaoxyallyl cation&#8208;guided ortho&#8208;activation of the adjacent aromatic ring is central to this process aided by HFIP. This reaction manifold offers broad access to oxindole derivatives.







Abstract
Herein, development and detailed investigation of a SN&#8242;&#8208;type intramolecular aromatic substitution reaction involving &#945;&#8208;arylazaoxyallyl cation intermediate, is disclosed. The study showcased that while &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;chlorohydroxamate could be activated by a combination of base and 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (HFIP) into the corresponding azaoxyallyl cations, it could further emerge into a &#960;&#8208;extended species involving the adjacent &#945;&#8208;aryl moiety, and this transition is contingent on electronic effects of the aromatic ring as well as on &#945;&#8208;substituents. An effective activation of the &#945;&#8208;aromatic ring could pave the path for intramolecular Ar(Csp2)&#8208;N bond formation towards oxindoles. Control experiments and DFT calculations suggested that a non&#8208;pericyclic nucleophilic amination pathway is most likely operative and precluded the possibility of concerted or electrophilic amination mechanism. HFIP as the reaction solvent plays pivotal roles in the transformation.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A detailed investigation&lt;/b&gt; on the reactivity of &#945;-arylated azaoxyallyl cation undergoing intramolecular nucleophilic aryl-amination under catalyst-free conditions is presented. Azaoxyallyl cation-guided &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-activation of the adjacent aromatic ring is central to this process aided by HFIP. This reaction manifold offers broad access to oxindole derivatives.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, development and detailed investigation of a S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;&#8242;-type intramolecular aromatic substitution reaction involving &#945;-arylazaoxyallyl cation intermediate, is disclosed. The study showcased that while &#945;-aryl-&#945;-chlorohydroxamate could be activated by a combination of base and 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP) into the corresponding azaoxyallyl cations, it could further emerge into a &#960;-extended species involving the adjacent &#945;-aryl moiety, and this transition is contingent on electronic effects of the aromatic ring as well as on &#945;-substituents. An effective activation of the &#945;-aromatic ring could pave the path for intramolecular Ar(C&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)-N bond formation towards oxindoles. Control experiments and DFT calculations suggested that a non-pericyclic nucleophilic amination pathway is most likely operative and precluded the possibility of concerted or electrophilic amination mechanism. HFIP as the reaction solvent plays pivotal roles in the transformation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>[Nb@Ge13/14]3&#8722;: New Family Members of Ge&#8208;Based Intermetalloid Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 62, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new clusters [Nb@Ge13]3&#8722; and [Nb@Ge14]3&#8722; were successfully synthesized; they represent the first 13&#8208; and 14&#8208;vertex endohedral Ge cages. HOMO&#8208;2 orbital of [Nb@Ge13]3&#8722; (left) shows a bonding character with respect to the shortest Nb&#8722;Ge contact, whereas the analogous HOMO&#8208;2 orbital of [Nb@Ge14]3&#8722; (right) shows anti&#8208;bonding character over the related fragment.







Abstract
During the past two decades, single&#8208;atom&#8208;centered medium&#8208;sized germanium clusters [M@Gen] (M=transition metals, n&gt;12) have been extensively explored, both from theoretical perspectives and experimental gas&#8208;phase syntheses. However, the actual structural arrangements of the Ge13 and Ge14 endohedral cages are still ambiguous and have long remained an unresolved problem for experimental implementation. In this work, we successfully synthesize 13&#8208;/14&#8208;vertex Ge clusters [Nb@Ge13]3&#8722; (1) and [Nb@Ge14]3&#8722; (2), which are structurally characterized and exhibit unprecedented topologies, neither classical deltahedra nor 3&#8208;connected polyhedral structures. Theoretical analysis indicates that the major stabilization of the Ge backbones arises due to the substantial interaction of Ge 4p&#8208;AOs with the endohedral Nb 4d&#8208;AOs through three/four&#8208;center two&#8208;electron bonds with an enhanced electron density accumulated over the shortest Nb&#8722;Ge13 contact in 1. Low occupancies of the direct two&#8208;center two&#8208;electron (2c&#8211;2e) Nb&#8722;Ge and Ge&#8722;Ge &#963; bonds point to a considerable degree of electron delocalization over the Ge cages revealing their electron deficiency.

         <title>Photostable NIR&#8208;II Pigments from Extended Rylenecarboximides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 62, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of organic near infrared (NIR) absorbers based on rylenecarboximide and anthraquinone were obtained with maximum absorption peaks ranging from 870&#8197;nm to 1100&#8197;nm. A photostable pigment with NIR&#8208;II absorption was developed through de&#8208;alkylation reaction under formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds.







Abstract
A series of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) organic absorbers, named FNs and FPs, have been obtained with absorption maxima from 870&#8197;nm to 1100&#8197;nm and thus falling into the attractive second near&#8208;infrared region (NIR&#8208;II). The synthesis of their extended aromatic cores utilized an initial aryl&#8208;amination between 4&#8208;aminonaphthalene&#8208;1,8&#8208;dicarboximide (NMI&#8208;NH2) or 9&#8208;aminoperylene&#8208;3,4&#8208;dicarboximide (PMI&#8208;NH2) with chloro&#8208;substituted 9,10&#8208;anthraquinones followed by a novel base&#8208;induced cyclodehydrogenation. A NIR&#8208;II pigment, compound FPP, was obtained through de&#8208;alkylation of a soluble precursor. The synthesis of this photostable pigment is high&#8208;yielding and avoids column chromatographic purification which is important for many applications.

&#960;&#8208;Extended Azaborole Helicenes. A unique set of &#960;&#8208;extended azaborole helicenes, assembled from N&#8208;heteroaromatic and dibenzo[g,p]chrysene building blocks, shows excellent optical properties. The lateral and helical extensions of the helicene scaffold significantly enhanced emission quantum yields and dissymmetry factors.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of laterally extended azabora[5]&#8208;, &#8208;[6]&#8208; and &#8208;[7]helicenes, assembled from N&#8208;heteroaromatic and dibenzo[g,p]chrysene building blocks is described. Formally, the &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems of the pristine azaborole helicenes were enlarged with a phenanthrene unit leading to compounds with large Stokes shifts, significantly enhanced luminescence quantum yields (&#934;) and dissymmetry factors (glum). The beneficial effect on optical properties was also observed for helical elongation. The combined contributions of lateral and helical extensions resulted in a compound showing green emission with &#934; of 0.31 and |glum| of 2.2&#215;10&#8722;3, highest within the series of &#960;&#8208;extended azaborahelicenes and superior to emission intensity and chiroptical response of its non&#8208;extended congener. This study shows that helical and lateral extensions of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems are viable strategies to improve features of azaborole helicenes. In addition, single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis of configurationally stable [6]&#8208; and &#8208;[7]helicenes was used to provide insight into their packing arrangements.

Alice points out the preference of one conformational enantiomer by &#8220;crossing the mirror&#8221; thanks to the catalyst formed from the phosphoric acid and bromine &#8220;delivered&#8221; by N&#8208;bromosuccinimide (NBS). Both the selected conformer and the new catalyst formed in&#8197;situ merge their respective roads to converge on the product. More information can be found in the Research Article by U. Uria, P.

         <title>Frontispiece: Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Olefin Metathesis: Recent Theoretical and Experimental Advances</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 62, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Olefin metathesis gives access to important petrochemicals, polymers, and pharmaceuticals. The catalysts for these transformations are often based on high&#8208;valent metal ions e.g., Ru(IV), which have been improved through ligand modifications. An attractive, but challenging goal is to catalyze olefin metathesis with a non&#8208;toxic, bio&#8208;compatible, and abundant element; namely, iron. Indeed, the first pieces of evidence suggest that low&#8208;valent Fe(II) complexes are active in olefin metathesis. This Review by K. Meyer, S. B. Tsogoeva, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201414) summarizes the key advances and challenges in this endeavor.

For the last 30&#8197;years, the lack of a binary phosphorus nitride containing PN6 octahedra formed a scientific chasm between carbon&#8208;group and oxygen&#8208;group nitrides, both featuring a variety of solids with XN6 units (X being a non&#8208;metal element). Now, the discovery of the &#948;&#8208;P3N5 and PN2 phosphorus nitrides&#8212;formed under high pressure and both composed of the elusive PN6 octahedron&#8212;builds a long&#8208;sought&#8208;after bridge between these two groups of nitrides.

Solar energy&#8208;driven overall water splitting (OWS) is an attractive way for generating green hydrogen. This review focuses on the current research status of BiVO4&#8208;constituted photo(electro)catalytic OWS systems, and summarizes the effective strategies for BiVO4 photo(electro)catalysts in a mainline of efficient charge utilization. It is hoped to provide comprehensive guidance for the construction of advanced solar OWS systems.







Abstract
Solar energy&#8208;driven overall water splitting (OWS) is an attractive way for generating clean and renewable green hydrogen. One key challenge is the construction of OWS systems with high solar energy conversion efficiencies, in which how to manipulate photoexcited charge carriers to efficiently participate in the reaction is the top priority. In recent years, bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) has emerged as one of the most promising materials for photo(electro)catalytic OWS and considerable progress has been achieved. In this review, recent advances of BiVO4&#8208;constituted OWS systems in both photoelectrocatalytic and photocatalytic approaches are presented in a mainline of effective charge carrier utilization. Various strategies for improved charge carrier utilization, including band structure engineering, improving charge separation, reducing charge recombination, and accelerating reaction kinetics, are summarized and analyzed in detail. Finally, perspective and outlook on further exploring the application potential of BiVO4 are proposed.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Olefin Metathesis: Recent Theoretical and Experimental Advances</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 62, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron&#8208;catalyzed olefin metathesis is high on the list of existing challenges in chemistry. Iron is one of the most abundant elements in the earth&#8216;s crust, and, therefore, iron catalysts would offer highly attractive alternatives to Ru&#8208; and Mo&#8208;based catalysts. This Review summarizes the key recent theoretical and experimental advances towards the development of iron&#8208;catalyzed olefin metathesis.







Abstract
The &#8220;metathesis reaction&#8221; is a straightforward and often metal&#8208;catalyzed chemical reaction that transforms two hydrocarbon molecules to two new hydrocarbons by exchange of molecular fragments. Alkane, alkene and alkyne metathesis have become an important tool in synthetic chemistry and have provided access to complex organic structures. Since the discovery of industrial olefin metathesis in the 1960s, many modifications have been reported; thus, increasing scope and improving reaction selectivity. Olefin metathesis catalysts based on high&#8208;valent group six elements or Ru(IV) have been developed and improved through ligand modifications. In addition, significant effort was invested to realize olefin metathesis with a non&#8208;toxic, bio&#8208;compatible and one of the most abundant elements in the earth&#8242;s crust; namely, iron. First evidences suggest that low&#8208;valent Fe(II) complexes are active in olefin metathesis. Although the latter has not been unambiguously established, this review summarizes the key advances in the field and aims to guide through the challenges.

         <dc:description>Metabolically stable C&#8208;glycosides are an essential family of compounds in bioactive natural products, therapeutic agents, and biological probes. For their application, development of synthetic methods by connecting glycosides and aglycons with strict stereocontrol at the anomeric carbon as well as with high functional group compatibility and environmental compatibility is a pivotal issue. Although Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura&#8208;type C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) cross&#8208;coupling using glycosyl boronates is a potential candidate for the construction of C&#8208;glycosides, neither the cross&#8208;coupling itself nor the facile synthesis of the coupling precursor, glycosyl boronates, have been achieved to date. Here, we succeeded in developing a Cu&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective one&#8208;step borylation of glycosyl bromides to glycosyl boronates and Pd&#8208;catalyzed stereospecific cross&#8208;coupling of &#946;&#8208;glycosyl borates with aryl bromides to give aryl &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides, in which the &#946;&#8208;configuration of the anomeric carbon of the glycosyl trifluoroborates is stereoretentively transferred to that of the resulting aryl C&#8208;glycosides.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Twisting Affects the Solid&#8208;State Photochemical Reactions of Unsaturated Ketones and the Photomechanical Effects of Molecular Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The three group of chalcone derivatives and their analogues involving halogen atoms (X = F, Cl, Br) have been synthesized. Firstly, the nearly planar acyclic chalcone derivatives were inclined to undergo photo&#8208;induced stereospecific [2+2] cycloaddition, which triggered the crystals to exhibit macroscopic motions of bending or cracking. In particular, the single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation happened upon UV irradiation of their crystals, which was helpful for the understanding photomechanical effects. The group of cyclic 3,4&#8208;dihydronaphthalen&#8208;based chalcone analogues possess a more twisted conformation, and they tend to take place trans&#8208;cis isomerization. No photomechanical effect was observed for the crystals of the cyclic chalcone analogues due to the lower isomerization rate. The twist degree of chroman&#8208;based chalcone analogues molecules was in between of the first two, [2+2] cycloaddition and trans&#8208;cis isomerization simultaneously underwent in their crystals. Photo&#8208;induced bending and twisting were observed for the crystals of chroman&#8208;based chalcone analogues. Therefore, the differences in molecular dihedral angles in a,b&#8208;unsaturated ketones were responsible for their photochemical characters and in turn to tune the photomechanical effects. In this work, a bridge between the molecular structures and solid&#8208;state photochemical reactions triggered photomechanical crystals is built.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid Access to Chiral and Tripodal Cavitands from &#946;&#8208;Pinene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abundant natural product &#946;&#8208;pinene can be rapidly converted into a library of chiral hosts that we call molecular tripods. As tripods complex chiral drugs in water, they hold promise for discovering and building novel sequestering agents, chemosensors or catalysts.







Abstract
We report Pd&#8208;catalyzed cyclotrimerization of (+)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;bromoenone, obtained from monoterpene &#946;&#8208;pinene, into an enantiopure cyclotrimer. This C3 symmetric compound has three bicyclo[3.1.1]heptane rings fused to its central benzene with each ring carrying a carbonyl group. The cyclotrimer undergoes diastereoselective threefold alkynylation with the lithium salts of five terminal alkynes (41&#8211;63&#8201;%, de=4&#8211;83&#8201;%). The addition enabled a rapid synthesis of a small library of novel chiral cavitands that, in shape, resemble a tripod stand. These molecular tripods include a tris&#8208;bicycloannelated benzene head attached to three alkyne legs twisted in one direction to form a nonpolar cavity with polar groups as feet. Tripods with methylpyridinium and methylisoquinolinium legs, respectively, form inclusion complexes with anti&#8208;inflammatory and chiral drugs (R)/(S)&#8208;ibuprofen and (R)/(S)&#8208;naproxen. The mode of binding shows drug molecules docked in the cavity of the host through ion&#8208;ion, cation&#8208;&#960;, and C&#8722;H&#8722;&#960; contacts that, in addition of desolvation, give rise to complexes having millimolar to micromolar stability in water. Our findings open the door to creating a myriad of enantiopure tripods with tunable functions that, in the future, might give novel chemosensors, catalysts or sequestering agents.

         <title>Multifunctional Organocatalysts &#8208; Singly&#8208;Linked and Macrocyclic Bisphosphoric Acids for Asymmetric Phase&#8208;Transfer and Br&#248;nsted&#8208;Acid Catalysis</title>

Covalently linked bisphosphoric acids deliver enhanced stereoselectivities compared to their monofunctional counterparts. The nature, length and number of linkers has a profound influence. Based on a library of singly&#8208;linked and macrocyclic bisphosphoric acids, we could identify catalysts suitable for electrophilic fluorinations and for asymmetric transfer&#8208;hydrogenations.







Abstract
The linking of phosphoric acids via covalent or mechanical bonds has proven to be a successful strategy for the design of novel organocatalysts. Here, we present the first systematic investigation of singly&#8208;linked and macrocyclic bisphosphoric acids, including their synthesis and their application in phase&#8208;transfer and Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis. We found that the novel bisphosphoric acids show dramatically increased enantioselectivities in comparison to their monophosphoric acid analogues. However, the nature, length and number of linkers has a profound influence on the enantioselectivities. In the asymmetric dearomative fluorination via phase&#8208;transfer catalysis, bisphosphoric acids with a single, rigid bisalkyne&#8208;linker give the best results with moderate to good enantiomeric excesses. In contrast, bisphosphoric acids with flexible linkers give excellent enantioselectivities in the transfer&#8208;hydrogenation of quinolines via cooperative Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis. In the latter case, sufficiently long linkers are needed for high stereoselectivities, as found experimentally and supported by DFT calculations.

         <title>An Extremely Stable Interprotein Tetrahedral Hg(Cys)4 Core Forms in the Zinc Hook Domain of Rad50 Protein at Physiological pH</title>

HgII toxicity: HgII targets the intermolecular ZnII&#8208;binding site of DNA binding protein Rad50 to form the strongest metal complex in the living world and jeopardize the DNA repair mechanism.







Abstract
In nature, thiolate&#8208;based systems are the primary targets of divalent mercury (HgII) toxicity. The formation of Hg(Cys)x cores in catalytic and structural protein centers mediates mercury's toxic effects and ultimately leads to cellular damage. Multiple studies have revealed distinct HgII&#8208;thiolate coordination preferences, among which linear HgII complexes are the most commonly observed in solution at physiological pH. Trigonal or tetrahedral geometries are formed at basic pH or in tight intraprotein Cys&#8208;rich metal sites. So far, no interprotein tetrahedral HgII complex formed at neutral pH has been reported. Rad50 protein is a part of the multiprotein MRN complex, a major player in DNA damage&#8208;repair processes. Its central region consists of a conserved CXXC motif that enables dimerization of two Rad50 molecules by coordinating ZnII. Dimerized motifs form a unique interprotein zinc hook domain (Hk) that is critical for the biological activity of the MRN. Using a series of length&#8208;differentiated peptide models of the Pyrococcus furiosus zinc hook domain, we investigated its interaction with HgII. Using UV&#8208;Vis, CD, PAC, and 199Hg&#8197;NMR spectroscopies as well as anisotropy decay, we discovered that all Rad50 fragments preferentially form homodimeric Hg(Hk)2 species with a distorted tetrahedral HgS4 coordination environment at physiological pH; this is the first example of an interprotein mercury site displaying tetrahedral geometry in solution. At higher HgII content, monomeric HgHk complexes with linear geometry are formed. The Hg(Cys)4 core of Rad50 is extremely stable and does not compete with cyanides, NAC, or DTT. Applying ITC, we found that the stability constant of the Rad50 Hg(Hk)2 complex is approximately three orders of magnitude higher than those of the strongest HgII complexes known to date.

         <title>Endoperoxides Compounds for Highly Efficient Cancer Treatment under Hypoxia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Singlet oxygen is one of the most important reactive oxygen species, which can induce intracellular bio&#8208;molecule damage and oxidative stress. Constructing endoperoxides photosensitizers to supply singlet oxygen during photodynamic therapy can effectively tackle the problem of hypoxic cancer therapy. The introduction of endoperoxides compounds provides a novel and promising strategy for cancer treatment under hypoxia.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) for cancer treatment has garnered tremendous attention with its promising non&#8208;invasiveness, low side effects, and spatiotemporal selectivity. However, the hypoxic microenvironment in solid tumours remains a serious resistant factor to reducing the effects of PDT. Endoperoxides are successfully utilized as the chemical storage or supplier of singlet oxygen (1O2), the active substance for PDT in materials and other domains. Recent reports indicated that this type of compound could remarkably enhance the therapeutic effects of PDT under hypoxia. This concept mainly introduces a few representative endoperoxides and the outlook of their potent application for treating hypoxic cancer cells.

         <title>Evidence for multiple binding modes in the initial contact between SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike S1 protein and cell surface glycans
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
More than one way to get in: A hexasaccharide bound to site&#8197;I of the spike protein in two binding modes (orange and green tubes) shows that multiple binding modes between heparan sulfate (HS) and S1 (electrostatic potential map on the surface) are allowed. The hypothetical macromolecular complex HS&#8722;S1 does not interfere with the interaction involving S1&#8208;RBD and ACE2, thus supporting the co&#8208;receptor role of HS in the activation of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 S protein.







Abstract
Infection of host cells by SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 begins with recognition by the virus S (spike) protein of cell surface heparan sulfate (HS), tethering the virus to the extracellular matrix environment, and causing the subunit S1&#8208;RBD to undergo a conformational change into the &#8216;open&#8217; conformation. These two events promote the binding of S1&#8208;RBD to the angiotensin converting enzyme&#8197;2 (ACE2) receptor, a preliminary step toward viral&#8208;cell membrane fusion. Combining ligand&#8208;based NMR spectroscopy with molecular dynamics, oligosaccharide analogues were used to explore the interactions between S1&#8208;RBD of SARS CoV&#8208;2 and HS, revealing several low&#8208;specificity binding modes and previously unidentified potential sites for the binding of extended HS polysaccharide chains. The evidence for multiple binding modes also suggest that highly specific inhibitors will not be optimal against protein S but, rather, diverse HS&#8208;based structures, characterized by high affinity and including multi&#8208;valent compounds, may be required.

         <title>Continuous Charge Transport in Carbon Nitride Modulated by Interfacial Chemical Bond and Homophase Junction to Boost Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electron transfer chain, which mimics the electron transport chain in natural photosynthetic system fabricated by the synergistic interfacial chemical bond and brookite TiO2 homophase junction promotes the charge separation efficiency in 2D carbon nitride.







Abstract
Efficient separation of photogenerated electrons and holes is of key importance in photocatalysis. Tuning the charge separation pathway is significant but still suffering from low efficiency for the charge extraction from semiconductors. Herein, taking 2D g&#8208;C3N4 (CN) nanosheets as a model photocatalyst, it was found the decoration of homophase junction between brookite TiO2 rods and nanoparticles (BN&#8208;BR) onto CN can effectively modulate photogenerated charge extraction and transfer in BN&#8208;BR/CN composites. The BN&#8208;BR/CN exhibits a remarkably enhanced photocatalytic H2 evolution under visible light irradiation (&#955;&gt;420&#8197;nm) compared with the single component. A continuous electron transfer channel constructed by an interfacial chemical bond Ti&#8722;O&#8722;N between CN and brookite rods (BR) and BN&#8208;BR homophase junction between brookite nanoparticles and rods was proposed to benefit the charge extraction and transfer. This work provides a strategy to tune the charge separation and transfer to facilitate the photocatalytic performance in heterogeneous photocatalysis.

         <title>Metal Nodes of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks can Activate Molecular Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal nodes of various robust metal&#8208;organic frameworks activate H2. The catalytic activity is a function of the composition of the metal node and the organic linker. It is proposed that the reaction mechanism is based on the operation of frustrated Lewis acid/base pairs.







Abstract
Hydrogenation of multiple bonds are among the most general and important organic reactions. Typical heterogeneous catalysts are based on transition metal nanoparticles, including noble metals. Data are presented here showing that metal nodes of MIL&#8208;101(Cr) and UiO&#8208;66 in the absence of occluded metal nanoparticles can promote hydrogenation of polarized X=Y double bonds of nitro and carbonyl groups. The catalytic activity is a function of the composition of the metal node and the organic linker. It is proposed that the reaction mechanism is based on the operation of frustrated Lewis acid/base pairs.

         <title>Efficient Hydrogenation of N&#8208;Heterocycles Catalyzed by NNP&#8211;Manganese(I) Pincer Complexes at Ambient Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several NImNHP&#8208;Mn(I) pincer complexes were synthesised and studied by a combination of experimental and theoretical investigations. Their interesting catalytic activities were shown in several hydrogenation reactions of N&#8208;heterocycles with good to excellent performance under very mild conditions.







Abstract
In summary, several imidazolylphosphine pincer ligands and the corresponding Mn complexes were synthesized, fully characterized, and studied by a combination of experimental and theoretical investigations. The complexes were tested in several hydrogenation reactions with good to excellent performance. Especially, the reduction of diverse N&#8208;heterocycles can be performed in excellent yields and high selectivity under very mild conditions using catalyst Mn&#8208;2&#8201;b. Spectroscopic studies support a classical metal&#8208;ligand cooperative mechanism for the activation of the catalyst, revealing amido as well as hydrido species. A third species could also be observed, tentatively assigned as the tert&#8208;butoxy species MnOtBu&#8208;NH&#8208;2&#8201;b. DFT supported these findings showing the possibility of equilibrium between all three catalyst species in the reaction. It further revealed higher kinetic reactivity as well as lower formation barrier for MnH&#8208;NH&#8208;2&#8201;b over MnH&#8208;NH&#8208;1&#8201;b as likely causes for its improved reactivity.

         <title>NMR Investigations of Protein&#8208;Carbohydrate Interactions: The Recognition of Glycans by Galectins Engineered with Fluorotryptophan Residues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorine (  19  F) incorporation into glycan binding proteins (lectins) has been achieved and exploited to monitor the binding to carbohydrate ligands by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy. Galectins are a family of lectins that bind carbohydrates, generally with weak affinities, through a combination of intermolecular interactions including a key CH&#8208;&#960; stacking interaction involving a conserved Trp residue. Herein, two galectins, Galectin&#8208;3 (Gal3) and Galectin&#8208;8 (Gal8) with one and two (different) carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs) respectively were selected. Gal3 contain only one Trp, while Gal8 contains three Trp, one at each CRD binding site and a third not involved in ligand binding, which were substituted by the corresponding F&#8208;Trp analogues. The presence of the fluorine did not significantly modify the affinity for glycan binding, which was in slow exchange in the  19  F NMR chemical shift time scale, even for weak ligands, and allowed to individualise binding events taking place at two different binding sites within the same lectin.</dc:description>

         <title>Modifying the St&#246;ber Process: Is the Organic Solvent Indispensable?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The St&#246;ber method is one of the most important and fundamental processes for the synthesis of inorganic (nano)materials, but has the drawback of using a large amount of organic solvent. Herein, we used ethanol as an example to explore if the organic solvent in a typical St&#246;ber method can be omitted. We found that ethanol increases the particle size of the obtained silica spheres and aids the formation of uniform silica particles rather than forming a gel. Nevertheless, the results indicated that an organic solvent in the initial synthesis mixture is not indispensable. We discovered, an initially immiscible synthesis method, which can replace the organic solvent&#8208;based St&#246;ber method to successfully synthesize silica particles with the same size ranges as the original St&#246;ber process without addition of organic solvents. Moreover, this process can be of further value to be extended to synthesis processes of other materials based on the St&#246;ber process.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Formylation of Unactivated Alkyl Chlorides to Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first rhodium&#8208;catalyzed formylation of&#160;non&#8208;activated alkyl chlorides with syn gas (H2/CO) allows to produce aldehydes in high yields (25 examples). A catalyst optimization study revealedRh(acac)(CO)2 in the presence of 1,3&#8208;bisdiphenylphosphinopropane (DPPP) as&#160;the most active catalyst system for this transformation. Key for the success of the reaction is the addition of sodium iodide (NaI) to the reaction system, which leads to the formation of activated alkyl iodides as intermediates. Depending on the reaction conditions, either the linear or branched aldehydes can be preferentially obtained, which is explained by a different mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Activity Relationships in Nucleic&#8208;Acid&#8208;Templated Vectors Based on Peptidic Dynamic Covalent Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of nucleic acids as templates which can trigger the self&#8208;assembly of their own vectors represent an emerging, simple and versatile, approach toward the self&#8208;fabrication of tailored nucleic acids delivery vectors. However, the structure&#8208;activity relationships governing this complex templated self&#8208;assembly process that accompanies the complexation of nucleic acids remains poorly understood. Here, we studied the class of arginine&#8208;rich dynamic covalent polymers (DCPs) composed of different monomers varying the number and position of arginines. We describe the combinations that lead to nucleic acid complexation, in saline buffer, using different templates, from short siRNA to long DNA. Finally, we identify a successful peptidic DCP featuring six&#8208;arginine repeating unit that promote the safe and effective delivery of siRNA in live cancer cells.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Stereoselective construction of unprotected &#946; &#8208;amino acids is a significant challenge owing to the lack of methods for the catalytic generation of highly enantioenriched carboxylic acid enolates. In this study, we developed a novel copper&#8208;catalyzed diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective reductive Mannich&#8208;type reaction of &#945;,&#946; &#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids, which provides a direct and scalable synthetic method for enantioenriched &#946; 2,3,3 &#8208;amino acids with vicinal stereogenic centers. Our protocol features in situ generation of transiently protected carboxylic acids by a hydrosilane and their diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective reductive coupling with ketimines. The synthetic utility of this process was demonstrated by a gram&#8208;scale reaction and the transformation of &#946; &#8208;amino acids.</dc:description>

         <title>Joining two switches in one nano&#8208;object: Photoacidity and photoisomerization in electrostatic self&#8208;assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Palladium(0)&#8208;Catalyzed Anti&#8208;Selective Addition&#8208;Cyclizations of Alkynyl Electrophiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Palladium(0)/monophosphine complexes catalyze anti&#8208;selective alkylative, arylative, and alkynylative cyclizations of alkynyl electrophiles with organometallic reagents. The remarkable anti&#8208;selectivity results from novel oxidative addition, i.e., the nucleophilic attack of electron&#8208;rich palladium(0) on the electrophile across the alkyne followed by transmetalation and reductive elimination ("anti&#8208;Wacker"&#8208;type cyclization). With regard to 5&#8208;alkynals, triphenylphosphine (PPh3)&#8208;ligated palladium(0) catalyzes the cyclization of terminal alkynes and conjugated alkenyl&#8208; or alkynyl&#8208;substituted ones to afford 2&#8208;cyclohexen&#8208;1&#8208;ol and 2&#8208;alkylidene&#8208;cyclopentanol derivatives, respectively. For 6&#8208;alkyl&#8208; or 6&#8208;aryl&#8208;5&#8208;alkynals, the cyclization does not proceed with the palladium/PPh3 catalyst; however, it does proceed with palladium/tricyclohexylphosphine (PCy3), to yield the former products predominantly. Remarkably, the latter catalyst completely switches the regioselectivity in the cyclization of the conjugated diyne&#8208;aldehydes. Notably, palladium/PPh3&#8208;catalyzed cyclizations also proceed with other organometallics or even without them.</dc:description>

         <title>Theoretical Exploration on the Role of Magnetic States to the N2&#160;Fixation behaviors of 2D Transition Metal Tri&#8208;borides (TMB3s)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fixing nitrogen (N2) by electrosynthesis method has become a promising way to ammonia (NH3) production, nevertheless, developing electrocatalysts combining long&#8208;term stable and low&#8208;cost feathers are&#160;still a great challenge to date. Using comprehensive first&#8208;principles calculations, we herein investigate the potential of a new class of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal tri&#8208;borides (TMB3s) as nitrogen reduction reaction&#160;(NRR) electrocatalysts, and explore the effect of magnetic orders on the NRR. Our results show that the TMB3s can sufficiently activate N2&#160;and convert it to NH3. Particularly, TiB3&#160;is identified as a&#160;high&#8208;efficiency catalyst for NRR because of its low limiting potential (&#8208;0.24 V) and good suppression of the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). For the first time, we present that these TMB3s with various magnetic states exhibit different performances in the adsorption of N2&#160;and NRR intermediates, and minor effect on activation of N2.&#160;Besides, VB3, CrB3, MnB3, and FeB3&#160;monolayers possess the superior capacity to suppress surface oxidation via the self&#8208;activating process, which reduces *O/*OH into *H2O under NRR electrochemical conditions, thus favoring the N2&#160;electroreduction.&#160;This work paves the way for finding high&#8208;performance NRR catalysts for transition metal borides&#160;and pioneering the research of magnetic states effects in NRR.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The analysis and regulation of proteins are of great significance for the development of disease diagnosis and treatment. However, complicated analytical environment and complex protein structure severely limit the accuracy of their analysis results. Thus, the selection of biometric molecules with good selectivity and high affinity is very important. Among them, peptide with lots of obvious advantages like good biocompatibility, low immunogenicity, variety, strong functionality, flexible chemical modification, etc. has attracted numerous attentions. In this review, we summarize the advances in the use of modular peptide probes for proteins analysis. It focuses on how to design and optimize the structure of probes, as well as their performance. Then, the specific applications of modular peptide probes are introduced. Finally, we also discuss current challenge and provide some ideas for the future direction for modular peptide probes, hoping to accelerate their clinical transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Edge Decorated Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons via Oxidative Coupling Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidative phenol coupling reduces reliance on halo/metalated substrates needed for conventional redox neutral couplings. A new strategy for construction of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that incorporates oxidative phenol coupling is outlined via a three&#8208;stage approach: oxidative fragment coupling, linking of two resultant units, and oxidative cyclization.&#160; The protocol allows rapid assembly of both planar and helical systems with a high degree of edge functionalization. The incorporation of 12 alkoxy groups on systems with 12&#8208;14 rings gave rise to lower optical gaps compared to systems with a lesser degree of edge functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Metal Incorporation Effect of Steady&#8208;Active FeP Hydrogen Evolution Nanocatalysts for Water Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal phosphides are promising noble metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but they usually suffer from inferior stability and thus are far from the device applications. We reported a facile and controllable synthetic method to prepare metal&#8208;incorporated M&#8208;FeP nanoparticles (M= Cr, Mn, Co, Fe, Ni, Cu, and Mo) with the guide of the density functional theory (DFT). The evaluated HER activity sequence was consistent with the DFT predictions, and cobalt was revealed to be the appropriate dopant. With the optimization of the Co/Fe ratio, the Fe0.67Co0.33P/C only required overpotentials of 67 mV and 129 mV to obtain the cathodic current density of 10 and 100 mA cm&#8208;2, respectively. It maintained the initial activity in the 10 hours stability test, surpassing the other Co&#8208;FeP/C catalysts. Ex&#8208;situ experiments demonstrated that the decreased element leaching and the increased surface phosphide content contributed to the high stability of the Fe0.67Co0.33P/C. A proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer was assembled using the Fe0.67Co0.33P/C as the cathodic catalyst. It showed a current density of 0.8 A cm&#8208;2 at the applied voltage of 2.0 V and retained the initial activity in the 1000 cycles&#8217; stability test, suggesting the potential application of the catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescent Crystalline Carbon&#8208; and Nitrogen&#8208;Centered Organic Radicals Based on N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Triphenylamine Hybrids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing luminescent radicals with tunable emission is a challenging task due to the limitation of alternative skeletons. Herein, a series of carbene&#8211;triphenylamine hybrids were prepared by the direct C2&#8208;arylation of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene with 4&#8208;bromo&#8208;N,N&#8208;bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)aniline. These hybrids showed multiple redox&#8208;active properties and could be converted to carbon&#8208;centered luminescent radicals with blue&#8208;to&#8208;cyan emissions (&#955;max: 436&#8211;486 nm) or nitrogen&#8208;centered luminescent radicals with orange emissions (&#955;max: 590&#8211;623 nm) through chemical reduction or oxidation, respectively. The radical species were characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, ultraviolet&#8208;visible spectroscopy, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffractometry analysis. Notably, the corresponding nitrogen&#8208;centered radicals exhibited good stability in atmospheric air, and their thermal decomposition temperatures were determined to be above 200&#176;C. In addition, spectral and theoretical calculations indicate that all radicals exhibit anti&#8208;Kasha emissions</dc:description>

         <title>Smart Phototheranostics based on Carbon Nanohorns for Precise Imaging&#8208;Guided Post&#8208;PDT toward Residual Tumor Cells after Initial Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As promising photonic material, phototheranostics can be activated in the laser irradiation range of tumor with sensitivity and spatiotemporal precision. However, it is difficult to completely eradicate solid tumors due to their irregularity and limited laser irradiation area. Herein, multi&#8208;stimulus responsive HA&#8208;Ce6@SWNHs were constructed with single&#8208;walled carbon nanohorns (SWNHs) and chlorine e6 (Ce6) modified hyaluronic acid (HA) via non&#8208;covalent binding. This SWNHs&#8208;based phototheranostics not only exhibited water dispersion but also could target tumor and be activated by near&#8208;infrared light for photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT). Additionally, HA&#8208;Ce6@SWNHs could be degraded by hyaluronidase in residual tumor cells, causing HA&#8208;Ce6 to fall off the SWNHs surfaces to restore autofluorescence, thus precisely guiding the programmed photodynamic treatments for residual tumor cells after the initial phototherapy. Thus, this work provides a rationally designed multiple&#8208;stimulus&#8208;response strategy to develop smart SWNHs&#8208;based phototheranostics for precise PDT/PTT and post&#8208;treatment imaging&#8208;guided PDT of residual tumor cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Comparative Screening of DalPhos/Ni Catalysts in C&#8208;N Cross&#8208;couplings of (Hetero)aryl Chlorides Enables Development of Aminopyrazole Cross&#8208;couplings with Amine Base</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Several focused reports have appeared over the past few years documenting the utility of nickel catalysts featuring newly developed DalPhos bisphosphine ligands for C&#8208;N cross&#8208;couplings of typically challenging (hetero)aryl chlorides with targeted NH nucleophiles. Herein, a more expansive and systematic competitive evaluation of this ligand family in N&#8208;arylation chemistry is provided involving primary (linear and branched) and secondary alkylamines, as well as a primary five&#8208;membered heteroarylamine (aminopyrazole), in combination with a diverse set of test electrophiles and bases (NaOtBu, K2CO3, DBU/NaTFA). In addition to providing optimal ligand/catalyst identification, and bringing to light methodology limitations (e.g., unwanted C&#8208;O cross&#8208;coupling with NaOtBu), our survey enabled the development of the first efficient catalyst system for heteroatom&#8208;dense C&#8208;N cross&#8208;coupling of aminopyrazoles and related nucleophiles with (hetero)aryl chlorides by use of an amine &#8216;dual&#8208;base&#8217; system.</dc:description>

         <title>How Bases Catalyze Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have quantum chemically studied the base&#8208;catalyzed Diels&#8208;Alder (DA) reaction between 3hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;pyrone and N&#8208;methylmaleimide using dispersion&#8208;corrected density functional theory. The uncatalyzed reaction is slow and is preceded by the extrusion of CO2 via a retro&#8208;DA reaction. Base catalysis, e.g., by triethylamine, lowers the reaction barrier up to 10 kcal mol&#8211;1, causing the reaction to proceed smoothly at low temperature, which quenches the expulsion of CO2, yielding efficient access to polyoxygenated natural compounds. Our activation strain analyses reveal that the base accelerates the DA reaction via two distinct electronic mechanisms: (i) by the HOMO&#8208;raising effect, which enhances the normal electron demand orbital interaction; and (ii) by donating charge into 3&#8208;hydroxy2&#8208;pyrone which accumulates in its reactive region and promotes strongly stabilizing secondary electrostatic interactions with N&#8208;methylmaleimide.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction with a binuclear bis&#8208;terpyridine pyrazole&#8208;bridged cobalt complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A pyrazole&#8211;based ligand substituted with terpyridine groups at the 3 and 5 positions has been synthesized to form the dinuclear cobalt complex  1  , that electrocatalytically reduces carbon dioxide (CO  2  ) to carbon monoxide (CO) in the presence of Br&#248;nsted acids in DMF. Chemical, electrochemical and UV&#8211;vis spectro&#8211;electrochemical studies under inert atmosphere indicate pairwise reduction processes of complex  1  . Infrared spectro&#8211;electrochemical studies under CO  2  and CO atmosphere are consistent with a reduced CO&#8211;containing dicobalt complex which results from the electroreduction of CO  2  . In the presence of trifluoroethanol (TFE), electrocatalytic studies revealed single&#8211;site mechanism with up to 94% selectivity towards CO formation when 1.47 M TFE were present, at &#8211;1.35 V  vs  Saturated Calomel Electrode in DMF (0.39 V overpotential). The low faradaic efficiencies obtained (&lt;50%) are attributed to the generation of CO&#8211;containing species formed during the electrocatalytic process, which inhibit the reduction of CO  2  .</dc:description>

         <title>Fast and Cost&#8208;Efficient 17O&#8208;Isotopic Labeling of Carboxylic Groups in Biomolecules: from Free Amino Acids to Peptide Chains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>17  O NMR spectroscopy is a powerful technique, which can provide unique information regarding the structure and reactivity of biomolecules. However, the low natural abundance of  17  O (0.04%) generally requires working with enriched samples, which are not easily accessible. Here, we present simple, fast and cost&#8208;efficient  17  O&#8208;enrichment strategies for amino acids and peptides, using mechanochemistry. First, five unprotected amino acids were enriched under ambient conditions, consuming only microliter amounts of costly labeled water, and producing pure molecules with enrichment levels up to ~ 40%, yields ~ 60&#8208;85%, and no loss of optical purity. Subsequently,  17  O&#8208;enriched Fmoc/  t  Bu&#8208;protected amino acids were produced on a 1g/day scale with high enrichment levels. Lastly, a site&#8208;selective  17  O&#8208;labeling of carboxylic functions in peptide side&#8208;chains was achieved for RGD and GRGDS peptides, with ~ 28% enrichment level. For all molecules,  17  O ssNMR spectra were recorded at 14.1T in reasonable times, making this an important step forward for future NMR studies of biomolecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of Isonitrile&#8208;Containing Natural Products in Complex Biological Matrices Through Ligation with Chlorooximes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isonitrile&#8208;containing natural products have garnered attention for their manifold bioactivities but are difficult to detect and isolate due to the chemical lability of the isonitrile functional group. Here, we used isonitrile&#8208;chlorooxime ligation (INC) in a reactivity&#8208;based screening (RBS) protocol for the detection and isolation of alkaloid and terpene isonitriles in the cyanobacterium Fischerella&#160;ambigua and the marine sponge Axinella sp., respectively. A trifunctional probe bearing a chlorooxime moiety, a UV active aromatic moiety, and a bromine label facilitated the chemoselective reaction with isonitriles, UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopic detection, and mass spectrometric analysis. The INC&#8208;based RBS allowed for the detection, isolation, and structural elucidation of isonitriles in microgram quantities.</dc:description>

         <title>Tweaking the Optoelectronic Properties of S&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons by Chemical Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peri&#8208;thiaxanthenothiaxanthene, an S&#8208;doped analog of&#160;peri&#8208;xanthenoxanthene, is used as a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) scaffold to tune the molecular semiconductor properties by editing the oxidation state of the S&#8208;atoms. Chemical oxidation of peri&#8208;thiaxanthenothiaxanthene with H2O2&#160;led to the relevant sulfoxide and sulfone congeners, whereas electrooxidation gave access to sulfonium&#8208;type derivatives forming crystalline mixed valence (MV) complexes. These complexes depicted peculiar molecular and solid&#8208;state arrangements with face&#8208;to&#8208;face&#160;p&#8208;p&#160;stacking organization. Photophysical studies showed a widening of the optical bandgap upon progressive oxidation of the S&#8208;atoms, with the bis&#8208;sulfone derivative displaying the largest value (E00&#160;= 2.99 eV). While peri&#8208;thiaxanthenothiaxanthene showed reversible oxidation properties, the sulfoxide and sulfone derivatives mainly showed reductive events, corroborating their&#160;n&#8208;type properties. Electric measurements of single crystals of the MV complexes exhibited a semiconducting behavior with a remarkably high conductivity at room temperature (10&#8208;1&#8208;10&#8208;2&#160;S cm&#8208;1&#160;and 10&#8208;2&#8208;10&#8208;3&#160;S cm&#8208;1&#160;for the O and S derivatives, respectively), one of the highest reported so far. Finally, the electroluminescence properties of the complexes were tested in light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs), obtaining the first mid&#8208;emitting PAH&#8208;based LECs.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkyne Activation in the Diversity Oriented Synthesis of sp2&#8208;Rich Scaffolds: A Biased Library Approach for Targeting Polynucleotides (DNA/RNA)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The targeting of polynucleotide (RNA and DNA) topologies and their protein complexes by small molecules has enormous potential in the discovery of new therapeutics across a broad range of diseases (infectious, chronic and congenital). Polynucleotides are very different structures to proteins and have a much greater capacity to form strong &#960;,&#960;&#8208;interactions with suitably &#960;&#8208;rich small molecules. To exploit this difference, we have developed a diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis approach to &#960;&#8208;rich scaffolds from a common set of substrates. The utility of this approach has been exemplified in the discovery of a novel topoisomerase&#8208;1 inhibitor.







Abstract
Polynucleotides, DNA and RNA (mRNA and non&#8208;coding RNAs) are critically involved in the molecular pathways of disease. Small molecule binding interactions with polynucleotides can modify functional polynucleotide topologies and/or their interactions with proteins. Current approaches to library design (lead&#8208;like or fragment&#8208;like libraries) are based on protein&#8208;ligand interactions and often include careful consideration of the 3&#8208;dimensional orientation of binding motifs and exclude &#960;&#8208;rich compounds (polyfused aromatics) to avoid off&#8208;target R/DNA interactions. In contrast to proteins, where &#960;,&#960;&#8208;interactions are weak, polynucleotides can form strong &#960;,&#960;&#8208;interactions with suitable &#960;&#8208;rich ligands. To assist in designing a polynucleotide&#8208;biased library, a scaffold&#8208;divergent synthesis approach to polyfused aromatic scaffolds has been undertaken. Initial screening hits that form moderately stable polynucleotide&#8208;ligand&#8208;protein ternary complexes can be further optimized through judicious incorporation of substituents on the scaffold to increase protein&#8208;ligand interactions. An example of this approach is given for topoisomerase&#8208;1 (TOP1), generating a novel TOP1 inhibitory chemotype.

         <title>Excitation&#8208;Wavelength&#8208;Dependent Functionalities of Temporally Controlled Sensing and Generation of Singlet Oxygen by a Photoexcited State Engineered Rhodamine 6G&#8208;Anthracene Conjugate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rhodamine 6G&#8208;anthracene conjugate acts as a conventional 1O2 sensor, a unique spatiotemporally controlled 1O2 sensor, or a good photosensitizer depending on the photoexcitation wavelengths. Experimental results and DFT calculations suggest that the unique multifunctionality was achieved by the unique photoexcited states of the molecule. The molecular ability in living cells was also demonstrated.







Abstract
The present study provides design guidance for unique multipotent molecules that sense and generate singlet oxygen (1O2). A rhodamine 6G&#8208;aminomethylanthracene&#8208;linked donor&#8208;acceptor molecule (RA) is designed and synthesized for demonstrating wavelength&#8208;dependent functionalities as follows; (i) RA acts as a conventional fluorogenic 1O2 sensor molecule like the commercially available reagent, singlet oxygen sensor green (SOSG), when it absorbs ultraviolet (UV)&#8208;visible light and reacts with 1O2. (ii) RA acts as a temporally controlled 1O2 sensing reagent under the longer wavelength (&#8764;700&#8197;nm) photosensitization. RA enters an intermediate state after capturing 1O2 and does not become strongly fluorescent until it is exposed to UV, blue, or green light. (iii) RA acts as an efficient photosensitizer to generate 1O2 under green light illumination. The spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer mediated intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC) process achieves this function, and RA shows a potential cancer&#8208;killing effect on pancreatic cancer cells. The wavelength&#8208;switchable functionalities in RA offer to promise molecular tools to apply 1O2 in a spatiotemporal manner.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Double Carbonylation of Nitroarenes with Aryl Halides Using Mo(CO)6 as a Reductant and Carbonyl Source</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones by palladium&#8208;catalyzed reductive double carbonylation of nitroarenes with aryl halides has been achieved. The key to success was the use of Mo(CO)6 as a reductant and bench&#8208;stable solid carbonyl source. Various aryl iodides, bromides, and trifluoromethanesulfonates are suitable reaction partners and produce corresponding nitrogen heterocycles in moderate to good yields. Notably, this method avoids the use of toxic CO gas and is further applied to the late&#8208;stage modification of estrone.







Abstract
A new palladium&#8208;catalyzed reductive double carbonylation of nitroarenes with aryl halides for the synthesis of benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones has been reported. The key to success was the use of Mo(CO)6 as a reductant and bench&#8208;stable solid carbonyl sources. Various aryl iodides, bromides, and trifluoromethanesulfonates are suitable reaction partners and produce corresponding benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;one derivatives in moderate to good yields. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that nitrosoarene was first generated as the key intermediate through nitro reduction. Remarkably, this method avoids the use of toxic CO gas and is further applied to the late&#8208;stage modification of estrone.

         <title>Dimorpholinoacetylene and Its Use for the Synthesis of Tetraaminocyclobutadiene Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dimorpholinoacetylene has been synthesized and structurally characterized as a new member of the class of electron&#8208;rich diaminoacetylenes. The new compound can be used to produce cyclic bent allene (CBA) transition&#8208;metal complexes or oxidized to give the first fully characterized cyclobutadiene dication. Detailed computational studies by NICS and current density calculations were carried out to assess the aromaticity of tetraaminocyclobutadiene dications.







Abstract
The new diaminoacetylene (DAA) dimorpholinoacetylene (3) was prepared from 1,1&#8208;dimorpholinoethene (1) by bromination to form the dibromoketene aminal 2, which upon lithiation afforded 3 through a Fritsch&#8208;Buttenberg&#8208;Wiechell rearrangement. Heating 3 at elevated temperatures resulted in a complete conversion into the dimer 1,1,2,4&#8208;tetramorpholino&#8208;1&#8208;buten&#8208;3&#8208;yne (4), which was used for the synthesis of four&#8208;membered cyclic bent allene (CBA) transition&#8208;metal complexes of the type [(CBA)MLn] (5&#8208;7; MLn=AuCl, RhCl(COD), RhCl(CO)2; CBA=1,3,4,4&#8208;tetramorpholino&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclobutadiene; COD=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene). The reaction of 3 with tetraethylammonium bromide gave 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetramorpholinocyclobutenylium bromide (8), which reacted with bromine to form 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetra(morpholino)cyclobutenediylium bis(tribromide) (9). Compound 9 represents the first fully characterized compound containing a tetraaminocyclobutadiene dication and displays a nearly planar C4N4 core as shown by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Detailed quantum chemical calculations were performed to assess the aromaticity of tetraaminocyclubutadiene dications by employing the Nucleus Independent Chemical Shift (NICS) method and current density analysis.

&lt;p&gt;The new diaminoacetylene (DAA) dimorpholinoacetylene (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;) was prepared from 1,1-dimorpholinoethene (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) by bromination to form the dibromoketene aminal &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, which upon lithiation afforded &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; through a Fritsch-Buttenberg-Wiechell rearrangement. Heating &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; at elevated temperatures resulted in a complete conversion into the dimer 1,1,2,4-tetramorpholino-1-buten-3-yne (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;), which was used for the synthesis of four-membered cyclic bent allene (CBA) transition-metal complexes of the type [(CBA)ML&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;; ML&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;=AuCl, RhCl(COD), RhCl(CO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; CBA=1,3,4,4-tetramorpholino-1,2-cyclobutadiene; COD=1,5-cyclooctadiene). The reaction of &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; with tetraethylammonium bromide gave 1,2,3,4-tetramorpholinocyclobutenylium bromide (&lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt;), which reacted with bromine to form 1,2,3,4-tetra(morpholino)cyclobutenediylium bis(tribromide) (&lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt;). Compound &lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt; represents the first fully characterized compound containing a tetraaminocyclobutadiene dication and displays a nearly planar C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; core as shown by X-ray diffraction analysis. Detailed quantum chemical calculations were performed to assess the aromaticity of tetraaminocyclubutadiene dications by employing the Nucleus Independent Chemical Shift (NICS) method and current density analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of 1&#8208;aminoisoquinolines&#160;and Its Application in&#160;Host&#8208;Guest&#8208;Doped Strategy&#160;To Construct Ultralong Room&#8208;Temperature&#160;Phosphorescence Materials for Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have attracted great attention for their wide applications in optoelectronic devices and bioimaging. However, the development of these materials remains a challenging task, partially due to the lack of rational molecular design strategies and unclear luminescence mechanisms. Herein, we present a method for facile access to structurally diverse substituted 1&#8208;aminoisoquinoline derivatives via a copper&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component coupling reaction, which provides a promising approach to rapidly assemble a library of 1&#8208;aminoisoquinolines for exploring the regularity of the host&#8208;guest doped system. A series of host&#8208;guest RTP materials with wide&#8208;range lifetimes from 4.4 to 299.3 ms were constructed by doping various substituted isoquinolines derivatives into benzophenone (BP). Furthermore, 4r/BP nanoparticles could be utilized for in vivo imaging with a signal to noise ratio (SNR) value as high as 32, revealing the potential of the isoquinoline framework for the construction of high&#8208;performance RTP materials.</dc:description>

Structural analyses reveal that all Dy(III) centers in complexes  1R  /  1S  and  2R  /  2S  are nine&#8208;coordinate with hula&#8208;loop coordination geometry, and the differences between  1R  /  1S  and  2R  /  2S  are the terminal coordination anion and counter anion. Magnetic studies indicate that complex  2S  displays typical SMM behaviors under a zero dc field, whereas  1S  just shows slow relaxation of magnetization resulting from a relatively weak axial crystal field.

         <title>Carba&#8208;Sugar Analogs of Glucosamine&#8208;6&#8208;Phosphate: New Activators for the glmS Riboswitch</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Riboswitches are 5'&#8208;untranslated mRNA regions mostly found in bacteria. They are promising drug targets to overcome emerging bacterial resistances against commonly used antibiotics. The glmS riboswitch is unique among the family of riboswitches as it is a ribozyme that undergoes self&#8208;cleavage upon binding to glucosamine&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate (GlcN6P). Previously, we could show that carba glucosamine&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate (carba&#8208;GlcN6P) induces self&#8208;cleavage of the riboswitch with a potency similar to GlcN6P. Here, we report a synthetic approach to a new class of carba&#8208;GlcN6P derivatives with an alkoxy substituent in the carba position. Key features of the synthesis are a ring closing metathesis reaction followed by a hydroboration. The strategy gives access to libraries of carba&#8208;GlcN6P derivatives. Ribozyme cleavage assays unraveled new activators for the glmS riboswitch from Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium difficile.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfation of&#160; Heparan and Chondroitin Sulfate Ligands Enables Cell Specific Homing of Nanoprobes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Demystifying the sulfation code of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) to induce precise homing of nanoparticles in tumor or neuron cells influences the development of a potential drug or gene delivery system. However, GAGs, particularly heparan sulfate (HS) and chondroitin sulfate (CS), are structurally highly heterogeneous, and synthesizing well&#8208;defined HS/CS composed nanoparticles is challenging. Here, we decipher how specific sulfation patterns on HS and CS regulate receptor&#8208;mediated homing of nanoprobes in primary and secondary cells. We discovered that aggressive cancer cells such as MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 displayed a strong uptake of GAG&#8208;nanoprobes compared to mild or moderate aggressive cancer cells. However, there was no selectivity towards the GAG sequences, indicating the presence of more than one receptor mediated uptake. Whereas U87 cells, olfactory bulb and hippocampal primary neurons showed selective or preferential uptake of CS&#8208;E coated nanoprobes compared to other GAG&#8208;nanoprobes. Further, mechanistic studies revealed that 4,6&#8208;O&#8208;disulfated&#8208;CS nanoprobe utilized CD44 and caveolin&#8208;dependent endocytosis pathway for the uptake. These results imply new opportunities to use GAG nanoprobes in nanomedicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Acridone&#8208;Based Host Materials for Green Phosphorescent and Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent OLEDs with Low&#8208;Efficiency Roll&#8208;Offs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

By combining carbazole and acridone units through pyridyl bridge, a bipolar host with highly twisted and rigid structure is developed, which guarantees the green phosphorescence and thermally activated delayed fluorescence OLEDs to exhibit remarkably low efficiency roll&#8208;offs.







Abstract
By linking the carbazole unit to the nitrogen atom of acridone through phenyl or pyridyl, two compounds, named 10&#8208;(4&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)acridin&#8208;9(10H)&#8208;one (AC&#8208;Ph&#8208;Cz) and 10&#8208;(5&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)acridin&#8208;9(10H)&#8208;one (AC&#8208;Py&#8208;Cz) were designed and synthesized. These two materials, characterized with highly twisted and rigid structure, good thermal stability, and balanced carrier&#8208;transporting properties, were employed as host materials for green phosphorescent and thermally activated delayed fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The carbazole group, despite its small contribution to the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) of these two materials, plays an essential role as an intramolecular host in energy delivering and improving the hole transporting ability of these two hosts. The incorporation of the electron&#8208;deficient pyridyl group as a linking group slightly improves the electron transporting capability of AC&#8208;Py&#8208;Cz. The green phosphorescent OLED (PhOLED) based on AC&#8208;Py&#8208;Cz exhibited excellent device performance with a turn&#8208;on voltage of 2.5&#8197;V, a maximum power efficiency and an external quantum efficiency (&#951;ext) of 89.8&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1 and 25.2&#8201;%, respectively, benefitting from the better charge&#8208;balancing ability of AC&#8208;Py&#8208;Cz host due to the presence of the pyridyl bridge. More importantly, all the devices based on these two hosts showed low efficiency roll&#8208;off at high brightness due to the suppressed non&#8208;radiative transition in the emitting layer. In particular, the AC&#8208;Py&#8208;Cz&#8208;hosted green PhOLED exhibited an efficiency roll&#8208;off of 1.6&#8201;% from the maximum next at a high brightness of 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 and a roll&#8208;off of 15.9&#8201;% at an extremely high brightness of 10000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. This study manifests that acridone&#8208;based host materials have great potential in fabricating OLEDs with low efficiency roll&#8208;off.

         <title>Photochemically Enhanced Emission by Introducing Rational Photoactive Subunits into an Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Luminogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational design strategy was proposed by introducing photoactive thienyl and pyridyl groups an AIE&#8208;active tetraarylethene skeleton to achieve photochemical fluorescence enhancement behavior, which provides a valuable design principle for photoconvertable fluorophores by controllably regulating photophysical processes and photochemical reactions of AIEgens.







Abstract
Herein, we propose a rational design strategy by introducing photoactive thienyl and pyridyl groups into an AIE&#8208;active tetraarylethene skeleton to achieve highly efficient photochemistry&#8208;activated fluorescence enhancement from dominantly photo&#8208;physical aggregation&#8208;induced emission behavior, and prove that such photoactivated fluorescence enhancement is perfectly suited for superstable photocontrollable dual&#8208;mode patterning applications in both solution and solid matrix. It is found that the photoactivated fluorescence of designed AIEgen is attributed to the irreversible cyclized&#8208;dehydrogenation reaction under UV irradiation, and the oxidation product has a brighter fluorescence in both solution and solid states owning to its rigid and planar structure. The overall transformation rate of the AIEgen from its opened form to dehydrogenated form is up to nearly 100&#8201;% in a short period of UV irradiation, and the fast transformation and the stable product of this photochemical reaction guarantees super stability of photocontrolled patterning, which can be applied in photoactivated dual&#8208;mode patterning and advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a novel synthesis strategy for facile access to a huge family of liquid crystal dimers or mono&#8208;addition homologues characterized with phosphonic group, which is readily achieved with P&#8722;C bonding through addition reaction between P&#8722;H and non&#8208;conjugated vinyl group. The introduced phosphonic group enables homeotropic alignment and further functionalization and one of the LC dimers exhibits NTB phase directly from the isotropic state.







Abstract
Liquid crystal (LC) dimers with well&#8208;defined composition and structure arouse broad attentions for their exhibiting LC properties beyond conventional low molar mass mesogens and serving as fascinating model compounds for LC polymers. Here in this work, a series of LC dimers bridged with a phosphonic group have been synthesized through a facile free radical mediated addition reaction between hypophosphorous acid and vinyl terminated cyanobiphenyl mesogens with variant length alkyl spacers. In addition, two esterified derivatives and a group of mono&#8208;addition homologues with a terminal phosphonic acid group have also been prepared for comparison study. All the newly synthesized compounds exhibit monotropic nematic (N) phase with typical schlieren textures except for the LC dimer with the longest eleven&#8208;methylene spacer, which surprisingly shows twist&#8208;bend nematic (NTB) phase directly from the isotropic state upon cooling. Moreover, the thermal transition properties such as the nematic&#8208;isotropic transition temperatures and associated entropy changes of the series LC dimers display a modest odd&#8208;even effect. Furthermore, both the LC dimers and the mono&#8208;addition homologues in N phase are quite easy to achieve homeotropic alignment upon annealing thanks to the supramolecular interactions between the introduced phosphonic acid group and the hydroxylated glass surface. This work thus provides a novel synthesis strategy for a class of LC materials bridged with a phosphonic acid group prone to further functionalization, which may serve as promising vertical alignment agents and pave the way for developing a new kind of functionalized LC materials of NTB phase.

         <title>Direct Aroylation of Olefins through a Cobalt/Photoredox&#8208;catalyzed Decarboxylative and Dehydrogenative Coupling with &#945;&#8722;Oxo Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A photoredox/cobalt dual catalytic procedure has been developed that allows benzoylation of olefins. Here the photoredox catalyst effects decarboxylation of &#945;&#8722;ketoacids to form benzoyl radicals. After addition of this radical to styrenes, the co&#8208;balt catalyst abstracts an H&#8208;atom. Hydrogen evolution from the putative cobalt hydride intermediate allows a Heck&#8208;like aroylation without the need for stoichiometric oxidant. Mechanistic studies reveal that electronically different styrenes lead to a curved Hammett plot, suggesting a change in product&#8208;determining step in the catalytic mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Self&#8208;Catalyzed Growth of Manganese Embedded 3D Flakes&#8208;Coated Carbon Rod as an Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction Catalyst of Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate for the first time the in&#8208;situ self&#8208;catalyzed growth of manganese embedded 3D flakes&#8208;coated carbon rod (GFC) as an efficient ORR catalyst of Zinc&#8211;air batteries. By optimizing the amount of Mn in the precursor, we synthesize a series of 3D graphene&#8208;like flakes&#8208;coated carbon rods. GFC with a doping amount of Mn of 10% (GFC&#8208;10) exhibits excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance with an onset potential of 0.94 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode). The Zinc&#8211;air battery is constructed with GFC&#8208;10 as the cathode catalyst, and it exhibits a peak power density of 128.9 mW cm&#8208;2 and a cycling stability of 75 h at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8211;2, which are superior to the commercial 20 wt % Pt/C&#8208;based Zinc&#8211;air battery. Interestingly, the introduction of Mn facilitates the self&#8208;catalyzed growth of carbon rods, and the change of Mn amount can effectively regulate the morphology of materials. The improved ORR performance of the catalyst is ascribed to the synergistic effect of unique hierarchical porous structure, high charge transport capacity, abundant carbon defects/edges and Mn&#8208;Nx sites. This research provides a new avenue to fabricating highly active Mn&#8208;based electrocatalysts for renewable energy systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrophile&#8208;Promoted Nucleophilic Cyclization of 2&#8208;Alkynylindoles to Give 4&#8208;Substituted Oxazinoindolones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A method for the synthesis of 4&#8208;organoselanyl oxazinoindolone derivatives by the cascade cyclization of N&#8208;(alkoxycarbonyl)&#8208;2&#8208;alkynylindoles using iron(III) chloride and diorganyl diselenides as promoters was developed. This protocol was applied to a series of N&#8208;(alkoxycarbonyl)&#8208;2&#8208;alkynylindoles containing different substituents. The reaction conditions also tolerated a variety of diorganyl diselenides having both electron donating and electron withdrawing groups. However, the reaction did not work for diorganyl disulfides and ditellurides. The reaction mechanism seems to proceed via an ionic pathway and the cooperative action between iron(III) chloride and diorganyl diselenides is crucial for successful cyclization.&#160; We also found that using the same starting materials, by simply changing the electrophilic source to iodine, led to the formation of 4&#8208;iodo&#8208;oxazinoindolones. The high reactivity of Csp2&#8208;Se and Csp2&#8208;I bonds were tested under cross&#8208;coupling conditions leading to the preparation of a new class of functionalized indole derivatives. In addition, the absorption, emission and electrochemical properties of 4&#8208;organoselanyl oxazinoindolones showed an important relationship with the substituents of the aromatic rings. The advantages of the methodology include the use of electrophilic to promote the cyclization reaction and functionalization of the indole ring, and the electronic properties presented by the prepared compounds can be exploited as probes, analyte detectors and optical materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Sequential C&#8211;H methylation Catalyzed by the B12&#8208;dependent SAM Enzyme TokK: Comprehensive Theoretical Study of Selectivities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>TokK is a B  12  &#8208;dependent radical SAM enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of the &#946;&#8208;lactam antibiotic asparenomycin A. It can catalyze three methylations on different sp  3  &#8208;hybridized carbon positions to introduce an isopropyl side chain at the &#946;&#8208;lactam ring of pantetheinylated carbapenem. Herein, we report a quantum chemical study of the reaction mechanism of TokK. A stepwise &#8216;&#8216;push&#8211;pull&#8217;&#8217; radical relay mechanism is proposed for each methylation: 5&#8217;&#8208;deoxyadenosine radical first abstracts a hydrogen atom from the substrate in the active site, then methylcobalamin directionally donates a methyl group to the substrate. More importantly, the calculations are able to uncover the origin of observed chemoselectivity and stereoselectivity for the first methylation and regioselectivity for the following two methylations. Further detailed distortion/interaction analysis can help to unravel the main factors controlling the selectivities. Our findings of sequential methylations by TokK may have profound implications for studying other B  12  &#8208;dependent radical SAM enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Resistance to Chloride Corrosion by Controlling the Morphologies of PtNi Electrocatalysts for Alkaline Seawater Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A solvothermal method to prepare PtNi alloys that have differing morphologies is described. By adjusting the feed ratio of Pt and Ni precursors in this process, PtNi alloys with different compositions (Pt:Ni atomic ratio from 1:3 to 3:1) and morphologies (evolution from nanobranches to nanoparticles) are generated. The prepared Pt48Ni52 alloy, which has a composite morphology comprised of nanobranches and nanoparticles, exhibits superior activity and durability towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in seawater compared to those of commercial Pt/C catalyst and other PtNi alloys that have different compositions and morphologies. The excellent seawater HER performance of Pt48Ni52 is ascribed to its nanobranch/nanoparticle morphology that optimally facilitates electron accumulation on Pt, which enhances resistance to chloride corrosion in seawater.</dc:description>

         <title>Red shift in optical excitations on layered copper perovskites under pressure: role of the orthorhombic instability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The red shift under pressure in optical transitions of layered compounds with CuCl  6  4&#8208;  units is explored through first&#8208;principles calculations and the analysis of available experimental data. The results on Cu  2+  &#8208;doped (C  2  H  5  NH  3  )  2  CdCl  4  , that is taken as a guide, show the existence of a highly anisotropic response to pressure related to a structural instability, driven by a negative force constant, that leads to an orthorhombic geometry of CuCl  6  4&#8208;  units but with a hole displaying a dominant 3z  2  &#8208;r  2  character (z being the direction perpendicular to the layer plane). As a result of such an instability, a pressure of only 3 GPa reduces by 0.21 &#197; the longest Cu  2+  &#8208;Cl  &#8208;  distance, lying in the layer plane, while leaving unmodified the two other metal&#8208;ligand distances. Owing to this fact, it is shown that the lowest  d&#8208;d  transition would experience a red shift of 0.34 eV while the first allowed charge transfer transition is also found to be red shifted but only by 0.11 eV that reasonably concurs with the experimental value. The parallel study on Jahn&#8208;Teller systems CdCl  2  :Cu  2+  and NaCl:Cu  2+  involving tetragonal elongated CuCl  6  4&#8208;  units shows that the reduction of the long axis by a pressure of 3 GPa is three times smaller than that for the layered (C  2  H  5  NH  3  )  2  CdCl  4  :Cu  2+  compound. Accordingly, the optical transitions of such systems, which involve a positive force constant, are much less sensitive to pressure than in layered compounds. The origin of the red shift under pressure undergone by the lowest  d&#8208;d  and charge transfer transitions of (C  2  H  5  NH  3  )  2  CdCl  4  :Cu  2+  is discussed in detail.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Metal&#8208;ion Complexation of a Biomimetic Calix[6]arene Funnel Cavity functioned with phenol or quinone</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the biomimetic context, many studies have evidenced the importance of the 1  rt  and 2  nd  coordination sphere of a metal ion for controlling its properties. Here, we propose to evaluate a yet poorly explored aspect, which is the nature of the cavity that surrounds the metal labile site. Three calix[6]arene&#8208;based aza&#8208;ligands are compared, that differ only by the nature of cavity walls, anisole, phenol or quinone (  L  OMe  ,  L  OH  and  L  Q  ). Monitoring ligand exchange of their Zn  II  complexes evidenced important differences in the metal ion relative affinities for nitriles, halides or carboxylates. It also showed a possible sharp kinetic control on both, metal ion binding and ligand exchange. Hence, this study supports the observations reported on biological systems, highlighting that the substitution of an amino&#8208;acid residue of the enzyme active site, at remote distance of the metal ion, can have strong impacts on metal ion lability, substrate/product exchange or selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Observation and Characterization of the Hg&#8208;O Diatomic Molecule: A Matrix&#8208;Isolation and Quantum&#8208;Chemical Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mercuric oxide is a well&#8208;known and stable solid, but the diatomic molecule Hg&#8208;O is very fragile and do not survive detection in the gas phase. However, laser ablation of Hg atoms from a dental amalgam target into argon or neon containing about 0.3% of 16 O 2 or of 18 O 2 during their condensation into a cryogenic matrix at 4 K allows the formation of O atoms which react on annealing to make ozone and new IR absorptions in solid argon at 521.2 cm &#8211;1 for Hg&#8208; 16 O or at 496.4 cm &#8211;1 for Hg&#8208; 18 O with the oxygen isotopic frequency ratio 521.2/496.4 = 1.0500. Solid neon gives a 529.0 cm &#8211;1 absorption with a small 7.8 blue shift. CCSD(T) calculations found 594 cm &#8211;1 for Hg 16 O and 562 cm &#8211;1 for Hg 18 O (frequency ratio = 1.0569). Such calculations usually produce harmonic frequencies that are slightly higher than the anharmonic (observed) values, which supports their relationship. These observed frequencies have the isotopic shift predicted for Hg&#8208;O and are within the range of recent high&#8208;level frequency calculations for the Hg&#8208;O molecule. Spectra for the related mercury superoxide and ozonide species are also observed for the first time.</dc:description>

         <title>Design and synthesis of a ferrocene&#8208;based diol library and application in the hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diol scaffolds have been utilized as highly effective catalysts and ligands in a wide range of catalytic asymmetric transformations. For scaffolds to be successful as broadly used motifs, they should be prepared cheaply through facile routes and be easily handled. Here, we describe the synthesis of a family of planar chiral diols based on a modular and robust 3 step route, which yields catalytically active diols in &gt;99% de and &gt;99% ee, with up to 7 different chiral elements. These diols have been characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, which provides clear evidence for the likely transition state when applied in the asymmetric hetero&#8208;Diels Alder reaction. Without altering the stereochemistry of the catalyst backbone, it is possible to access both enantiomers of the product by varying the substitution of the catalyst at the &#945;&#8208;position.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid 18F&#8208; and 19F&#8208;Difluoromethylation via Desulfurative Fluorination of Transient N&#8208;, O&#8208;, and C&#8208;Linked Dithioles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The difluoromethyl group plays an important role in modern medicinal and agrochemistry. While several difluoromethylation reagents have been reported, these typically rely on difluoromethyl carbenes or anions, or target specific processes. Here we describe a conceptually unique and general process for O&#8208;H, N&#8208;H and C&#8208;H difluoromethylation that involves the formation of a transient dithiole followed by facile desulfurative fluorination using silver(I)fluoride. We also introduce the 5,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;benzodithiole (DMBDT) function, which undergoes sufficiently rapid desulfurative fluorination to additionally support  18  F&#8208;difluoromethylation. This new process is compatible with the wide range of functional groups typically encountered in medicinal chemistry campaigns and the use of [  18  F]AgF is demonstrated in the production of  18  F&#8208;labelled derivatives of testosterone, perphenazine, and melatonin,58.0+/&#8208;2.2, 20.4+/&#8208;0.3 and 32.2+/&#8208;3.6 MBq/umol, respectively.&#160; We expect the DMBDT group and this  18  F/  19  F&#8208;difluoromethylation process will inspire and support new efforts in medicinal and agrochemistry and radiotracer production.</dc:description>

         <title>Bright Organic Mechanoluminescence and Remarkable Mechanofluorochromism from Circularly Polarized TADF Enantiomers with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of circularly polarized thermally activated delayed fluorescence (CP&#8208;TADF) luminogens with stimuli&#8208;response characteristics remains challenging. Herein, a pair of organic enantiomers,  S  &#8208;CzTA and  R  &#8208;CzTA, with aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties, have been successfully developed by introducing chiral 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydronaphthalene and carbazole to phthalimide. They present CP&#8208;TADF properties in toluene solutions, giving dissymmetric factors of 0.84&#215;10  &#8208;3  and &#8208;1.03&#215;10  &#8208;3  , respectively. In the crystalline state, both  S  &#8208;CzTA and  R  &#8208;CzTA can emit intense blue TADF and produce very bright sky&#8208;blue mechanoluminescence (ML) and remarkable mechanofluorochromism (MFC) under the stimuli of mechanical force. Single&#8208;crystal analysis and theoretical calculation results suggest that their ML activities are probably associated with their chiral and polar molecular structures and unique noncentrosymmetric molecular packing modes. Furthermore, the MFC properties of the enantiomers likely originate from the destruction of crystal structure, leading to the planarization of molecular conformation. This work may provide helpful guidance for developing new CP&#8208;TADF materials with force&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Ultrabright and Dendritic Xanthenes for Enhanced Click Chemistry&#8208;Based Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biorthogonal labelling with fluorescent small molecules is an indispensable tool for diagnostic and biomedical applications. In dye&#8208;based 5&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;2'&#8208;deoxyuridine (EdU) cell proliferation assays, augmentation of the fluorescent signal entails an overall enhancement in the sensitivity and quality of the method. To this end, we established a rapid, divergent synthetic route that provides  ready&#8208;to&#8208;click  pH&#8208;insensitive rhodamine dyes exhibiting outstanding brightness. Compared to the shortest available synthesis of related high quantum&#8208;yielding rhodamines, two fewer synthetic steps are required. In a head&#8208;to&#8208;head imaging comparison involving copper(I)&#8208;catalysed azide alkyne cycloaddition reactions with  in&#8208;vitro  administered EdU, our novel 3,3&#8208;difluoroazetidine rhodamine azide outperformed the popular 5&#8208;TAMRA&#8208;azide, making it among the best available choices when it comes to fluorescent imaging of DNA. In a further exploration of the fluorescence properties of these dyes, a set of bis&#8208;MPA dendrons carrying multiple fluorescein or rhodamine units was prepared  via  branching click chemistry. Fluorescence self&#8208;quenching of fluorescein&#8208; and rhodamine&#8208;functionalized dendrons limited the suitability of the dyes as labels in EdU&#8208;based experiments but provided novel insights into these effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Confused&#8208;Prism[5]arene: a Conformationally Adaptive Host by Stereoselective Opening of the 1,4&#8208;Bridged Naphthalene Flap</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The confused&#8208;prism[5]arene macrocycle (  c  &#8208;  PrS[5]  Me  ) shows conformational adaptive behavior in the presence of am&#8208;monium guests. Upon the guest inclusion, the 1,4&#8208;bridged naphthalene flap reverses its planar chirality from p  S  to p  R  (with reference to the p  S  (p  R  )  4  enantiomer). Stereoselective directional threading is also observed in the presence of directional axles, in which up/down stereoisomers of homochiral (p  R  )  5  &#8208;  c  &#8208;  PrS[5]  Me  pseudorotaxanes are formed.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating the G&#8208;quadruplex and Duplex DNA Binding&#160;by Controlling the Charge of Fluorescent Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two fluorescent and non&#8208;toxic spirobifluorene molecules bearing either positive (Spiro&#8208;NMe3) or negative (Spiro&#8208;SO3) charged moieties attached to the same aromatic structure have been investigated as binders for DNA. The novel Spiro&#8208;NMe3 containing four alkylammonium substituents interacts with G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) DNA structures and shows preference for G4s over duplex by means of FRET melting and fluorescence experiments. The interaction is governed by the charged substituents of the ligands as deduced from the lower binding of the sulfonate analogue (Spiro&#8208;SO3). On the contrary, Spiro&#8208;SO3 exhibits higher binding affinity to duplex DNA structure than to G4. Both molecules show a moderate quenching of the fluorescence upon DNA binding. The confocal microscopy evaluation shows the internalization of both molecules in HeLa cells and their lysosomal accumulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Closed Bipolar Electrode Array for Optical Reporting Reaction Coupled Electrochemical Sensing and Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this review, closed bipolar electrode (BPE) array using an electrofluorochromism (EFC) or electrochemiluminescence (ECL) reaction as the reporting reaction is centered on. Electrochemical signals at one pole of the closed BPE array can be transduced into the EFC or ECL signals at the opposite pole. Therefore, the current signal of a redox reaction can be easily detected and imaged by monitoring the luminescence signal. Recent developments of the closed BPE array based EFC and ECL sensing and imaging are summarized and discussed in detail. Finally, we propose the challenges and opportunities for improving the spatial resolution of the closed BPE array based electrochemical imaging, and emphasize the important application of this technique to the imaging of cellular activities at single&#8208;cell level.</dc:description>

         <title>A Cascade Sonogashira Cross&#8208;Coupling&#8208;Substitution&#8208;Elimination Reaction for the Synthesis of Linear Conjugated Dienynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling, nucleophilic substitution and elimination cascade reaction allows the synthesis of otherwise difficult to obtain linear dienynes, in moderate to high yields. Ionic liquids are suitable recyclable solvents for the reaction. This synthetic strategy opens new ways to prepare highly conjugated alkenes and alkynes.







Abstract
The engagement in tandem of well&#8208;known organic reactions such as the Pd&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reaction, nucleophilic substitution and elimination reactions, enables the synthesis of otherwise difficult to obtain linear dienynes, in moderate to high yields. This retrosynthetic approach opens new ways to prepare highly conjugated alkenes and alkynes. Furthermore, ionic liquids are suitable solvents to perform the cascade reaction and recycle the metal catalysts.

The divergent lithiation of 2,3&#8208;dihalopyridines is reported. Taking advantage of continuous&#8208;flow technology, either the deprotolithiation or the halogen dance is carried out. After subsequent trapping with various electrophiles, 25 examples of both regioisomers were obtained in excellent yields and selectivities. Finally, this methodology was scaled up and a promising space&#8208;time yield was obtained.







Abstract
We describe herein the first halogen dance (HD) in continuous flow on 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;3&#8208;bromopyridine by selectively trapping a (pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)lithium species that is known to undergo the halogen&#8208;dance process. In addition, this lithiated intermediate was trapped at lower temperature before the HD occurs. The HD process was extended to fluoro&#8208;iodopyridines by using various electrophiles to afford 28 examples with yields ranging from 42 to 97&#8201;% with very short residence times. Finally, scale up of the reaction was demonstrated, affording a promising space&#8208;time yield (STY) of 4.2&#8197;kg.h&#8722;1.L&#8722;1.

         <title>A Stereodivergent Approach to the Synthesis of gem&#8208;Diborylcyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A designed strategy for a highly efficient protocol for the diastereodivergent construction of gem&#8208;dibroylcyclopropanes has been established. This was accomplished via the Pd(OAc)2&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation reaction of the gem&#8208;diborylalkene &#8220;carbenophile&#8208;reactive&#8221; groups with different &#945;&#8208;diazoarylacetates and &#945;&#8208;diazoaryl&#8208;CF3.







Abstract
We report a designed stereodivergent strategy for the synthesis of gem&#8208;diborylcyclopropanes. The reaction provides a highly modular approach to prepare cyclopropane ring variants bearing gem&#8208;(Bpin,Bpin), gem&#8208;(Bpin,Bdan), and gem&#8208;(Bpin,BF3K), with outstanding levels of stereocontrol. This was achieved by diastereoselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation reactions of gem&#8208;diborylalkenes with &#945;&#8208;diazoarylacetates and &#945;&#8208;diazoaryl&#8208;trifluoromethyl. The key to the success of this general protocol was the diastereoselective trifluorination reaction of gem&#8208;diborylcyclopropanes, followed by the stereospecific interconversion of the trifluoroborate salts into the Bdan group.

         <title>Light&#8208;Responsive Oligothiophenes Incorporating Photochromic Torsional Switches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twist it! A light&#8208;responsive molecular design to tune the &#960;&#8208;conjugation extension of oligothiophenes has been established. The relationship between molecular structure and optoelectronic properties was comprehensively studied both experimentally and theoretically. The results highlight the functionality of the proposed molecular architecture as a promising candidate for the development of novel light&#8208;responsive optoelectronic technologies.







Abstract
We present a quaterthiophene and sexithiophene that can reversibly change their effective &#960;&#8208;conjugation length through photoexcitation. The reported compounds make use of light&#8208;responsive molecular actuators consisting of an azobenzene attached to a bithiophene unit by both direct and linker&#8208;assisted bonding. Upon exposure to 350&#8197;nm light, the azobenzene undergoes trans&#8208;to&#8208;cis isomerization, thus mechanically inducing the oligothiophene to assume a planar conformation (extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation). Exposure to 254&#8197;nm wavelength promotes azobenzene cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans isomerization, forcing the thiophenic backbones to twist out of planarity (confined &#960;&#8208;conjugation). Twisted conformations are also reached by cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans thermal relaxation at a rate that increases proportionally with the conjugation length of the oligothiophene moiety. The molecular conformations of quaterthiophene and sexithiophene were characterized by using steady&#8208;state UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography and quantum&#8208;chemical modeling. Finally, we tested the proposed light&#8208;responsive oligothiophenes in field&#8208;effect transistors to probe the photo&#8208;induced tuning of their electronic properties.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Push&#8208;Pull Diphenylsulfone Derivatives towards Aggregation&#8208;Induced Narrowband Deep Blue Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accompanying effects of restricted intramolecular rotations and intermolecular interactions in D&#8722;A&#8722;D&#8217; typed molecules led to successively blue&#8208;shifted wavelength and narrowed bandwidth from solution to amorphous film then to crystals, realizing deep blue TADF (&#955;=424&#8197;nm, CIE coordinate of (0.15, 0.08), &#916;EST=0.07&#8197;eV) with FWHM of 64&#8197;nm in crystals of tBuO&#8208;SOmAD.







Abstract
Narrowband deep blue thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) materials have attracted significant attention. Herein, four asymmetrical structured TADF emitters based on diphenylsulfone (DPS) acceptor and 9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroacridine (DMAC) donor with progressive performances were developed. The tert&#8208;butyloxy auxiliary electron&#8208;donor was adopted to restrict the intramolecular rotations and provide efficient steric hindrance. Regioisomerization by altering the substitution position of DMAC on DPS unit further enhanced the intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;molecular interactions. The accompanying effects yielded increased energy level, minimized reorganization energy, and inhibited non&#8208;radiative transitions in the crystals of tBuO&#8208;SOmAD, which achieved narrowband deep&#8208;blue emission peaking at 424&#8197;nm (FWHM=64&#8197;nm, &#934;F=33.6&#8201;%) through aggregation&#8208;induced, blue&#8208;shifted emission (AIBSE). In addition, deep&#8208;blue organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on tBuO&#8208;SOmAD realized the electroluminescence (EL) spectrum peaking located at 435&#8197;nm and CIE coordination of (0.12, 0.09).

         <title>An Endoplasmic Reticulum Targeting Type I Photosensitizer for Effective Photodynamic Therapy against Hypoxic Tumor Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ER&#8208;targeted benzophenothiazine&#8208;based photosensitizer NBS&#8208;ER was constructed, which triggered ER stress and induced apoptosis with significantly reduced dark toxicity and improved phototoxicity index (PI). In addition, excellent photodynamic therapeutic effect of NBS&#8208;ER was demonstrated in 4T1&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice.







Abstract
Organelle&#8208;targeted type I photodynamic therapy (PDT) shows great potential to overcome the hypoxic microenvironment in solid tumors. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an indispensable organelle in cells with important biological functions. When the ER is damaged due to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the accumulation of misfolded proteins will interfere with ER homeostasis, resulting in ER stress. Here, an ER&#8208;targeted benzophenothiazine&#8208;based photosensitizer NBS&#8208;ER was presented. ER targeting modification significantly reduced the dark toxicity and improved phototoxicity index (PI). NBS&#8208;ER could effectively produce O2&#8722;&#8901; with near&#8208;infrared irradiation, making its phototoxicity under hypoxia close to that under normoxia. Meanwhile, the photoinduced ROS triggered ER stress and induced apoptosis. In addition, NBS&#8208;ER possessed excellent photodynamic therapeutic effect in 4T1&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice.

         <title>Probing the Structural Dynamics of a Bacterial Chaperone in Its Native Environment by Nitroxide&#8208;Based EPR Spectroscopy</title>

         <dc:description>
Take a quick look: NarJ protein structural dynamics was investigated by SDSL&#8208;EPR in the complex environment of the cell. In particular, we exploited the sensitivity of nitroxide labels to report protein dynamics at room temperature. Moreover, we demonstrated that such studies can be performed within 15&#8197;minutes, thus preserving both cell integrity and the activity of the protein under investigation.







Abstract
One of the greatest current challenges in structural biology is to study protein dynamics over a wide range of timescales in complex environments, such as the cell. Among magnetic resonances suitable for this approach, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy coupled to site&#8208;directed spin labeling (SDSL&#8208;EPR) has emerged as a promising tool to study protein local dynamics and conformational ensembles. In this work, we exploit the sensitivity of nitroxide labels to report protein local dynamics at room temperature. We demonstrate that such studies can be performed while preserving both the integrity of the cells and the activity of the protein under investigation. Using this approach, we studied the structural dynamics of the chaperone NarJ in its natural host, Escherichia coli. We established that spin&#8208;labeled NarJ is active inside the cell. We showed that the cellular medium affects NarJ structural dynamics in a site&#8208;specific way, while the structural flexibility of the protein is maintained. Finally, we present and discuss data on the time&#8208;resolved dynamics of NarJ in cellular context.

         <title>Selective and Reversible Solvent Uptake in Tetra&#8208;4&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridyl)phenylmethane&#8208;based Supramolecular Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TPPM&#8208;based Supramolecular Organic Frameworks (SOFs) undergo reversible single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformations when exposed to vapours of selected organic solvents and heat, respectively. The observed selectivity is dictated by the fitting of the guest in the expanded SOFs, following the degree of packing coefficient.







Abstract
The dynamic behavior of supramolecular organic frameworks (SOFs) based on the rigid tetra&#8208;4&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridyl)phenylmethane (TPPM) organic tecton has been elucidated through 3D electron diffraction, X&#8208;ray powder diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis. The SOF undergoes a reversible single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation when exposed to vapours of selected organic solvents, moving from a closed structure with isolated small voids to an expanded structure with solvated channels along the b axis. The observed selectivity is dictated by the fitting of the guest in the expanded SOF, following the degree of packing coefficient. The effect of solvent uptake on TPPM solid&#8208;state fluorescence was investigated, evidencing a significant variation in the emission profile only in the presence of chloroform.

         <title>Chiral Anthranyl Trifluoromethyl Alcohols: Structures, Oxidative Dearomatization and Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral diphenylanthracenes with two fluorinated alcohols have two stereogenic centers and syn/anti atropisomery. Consequently, depending on their stereochemistry, they make different Hydrogen&#8208;bonded self&#8208;assemblies in the solid state, whereas in solution, they specifically react to provide different chiral dearomatized bisfluorinated ethers. The chiroptical properties of all anthranyl fluorinated molecules have been compared.







Abstract
Chiral trifluoromethyl alcohol groups were introduced at the hindered ortho positions of 9,10&#8208;diphenylanthracenes to investigate their effects on the physical properties and reactivity towards oxidative dearomatization. In such compact structures, the position in different quadrants and the preferred orientation of the &#8722;CH(OH)CF3 groups were determined by the relative and absolute configurations of each stereoisomer, respectively. As a consequence, the stereochemistry governs the organization of the H&#8208;bonded molecules in single crystals (homochiral dimers vs ribbon), whereas in chlorinated solvents, they all behave as discrete compounds. Concerning their reactivity, the stereospecific dearomative oxidation of these molecules leads to 9,10&#8208;bis&#8208;spiro&#8208;isobenzofuran&#8208;anthracenes, when using organic single&#8208;electron transfer oxidants. The chiroptical properties of the alcohols and the corresponding dearomatized products were compared and showed an important modulation of the intensity.

         <title>Photophysics of Anionic Bis(4H&#8208;imidazolato)CuI Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Homoleptic CuI 4H&#8208;imidazolate complexes show a remarkably broad and intense absorption spectrum ranging from the UV to NIR. The excited state decay pathways of four complexes selected for their electron&#8208;withdrawing and steric properties were studied by fs transient absorption spectroscopy and spectro&#8208;electrochemistry. A model&#8208;free 2D correlation approach was applied for data evaluation.







Abstract
In this paper, the photophysical behavior of four panchromatically absorbing, homoleptic bis(4H&#8208;imidazolato)CuI complexes, with a systematic variation in the electron&#8208;withdrawing properties of the imidazolate ligand, were studied by wavelength&#8208;dependent time&#8208;resolved femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. Excitation at 400, 480, and 630&#8197;nm populates metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer, intraligand charge transfer, and mixed&#8208;character singlet states. The pump wavelength&#8208;dependent transient absorption data were analyzed by a recently established 2D correlation approach. Data analysis revealed that all excitation conditions yield similar excited&#8208;state dynamics. Key to the excited&#8208;state relaxation is fast, sub&#8208;picosecond pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion, which is accompanied by the relocalization of electron density onto a single ligand from the initially delocalized state at Franck&#8208;Condon geometry. Subsequent intersystem crossing to the triplet manifold is followed by a sub&#8208;100&#8197;ps decay to the ground state. The fast, nonradiative decay is rationalized by the low triplet&#8208;state energy as found by DFT calculations, which suggest perspective treatment at the strong coupling limit of the energy gap law.

         <title>Bromine Pentafluoride BrF5, the Formation of [BrF6]&#8722; Salts, and the Stereochemical (In)activity of the Bromine Lone Pairs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking a closer look: We present the photochemical synthesis of BrF5, its high&#8208; and low&#8208;temperature crystal structures, its reactions with some alkali metal fluorides and a discussion of the free valence electron pairs on the bromine atoms of the BrF5 molecules and [BrF6]&#8722; anions by using intrinsic bond orbitals.







Abstract
BrF5 can be prepared by treating BrF3 with fluorine under UV light in the region of 300 to 400&#8197;nm at room temperature. It was analyzed by UV&#8208;Vis, NMR, IR and Raman spectroscopy. Its crystal structure was redetermined by X&#8208;ray diffraction, and its space group was corrected to Pnma. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations were performed for the band assignment of the vibrational spectra. A monoclinic polymorph of BrF5 was quantum chemically predicted and then observed as its low&#8208;temperature modification in space group P21/c by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. BrF5 reacts with the alkali metal fluorides AF (A=K, Rb) to form alkali metal hexafluoridobromates(V), A[BrF6] the crystal structures of which have been determined. Both compounds crystallize in the K[AsF6] structure type (R
, no. 148, hR24). For the species [BrF6]+, BrF5, [BrF6]&#8722;, and [IF6]&#8722;, the chemical bonds and lone pairs on the heavy atoms were investigated by means of intrinsic bond orbital analysis.

         <title>Self&#8208;Repairable and Flexible Polymer Network Electrolyte with Enhanced Lithium&#8208;Ion Conduction for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;healing quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolyte (SIPH&#8208;x&#8208;y%) with good flexibility was prepared by polyaddition method. SIPH&#8208;x&#8208;y% could show high room temperature ionic conductivity, high lithium ion transference number, and good interfacial stability with electrode. The Li/LFP battery assembled with SIPH&#8208;20&#8208;40% showed high specific capacity and excellent cycle performance.







Abstract
Developing high&#8208;performance functional polymer&#8208;based electrolytes is important for realizing next generation safe lithium metal batteries. In this study, a new type of quasi&#8208;solid polymer network electrolyte (SIPH&#8208;x&#8208;y%) was prepared by combining synthesized polymer network (SIPH) containing urethane bond linked ionic liquids (ILs), polyethylene glycol (PEG), and disulfide bond moieties, lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide salt (LiTFSI), and glyme type additive. It was found that SIPH&#8208;20&#8208;40% was mechanically flexible, self&#8208;healable, and showed high ionic conductivity of 2.67&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1. Also, SIPH&#8208;20&#8208;40% possesses a high lithium ion transference number of 0.43 and good electrochemical stability. These properties enabled the SIPH&#8208;20&#8208;40% electrolyte membrane to support Li/Li symmetrical cell to cycle stably during long term Li plating and stripping. The Li/SIPH&#8208;20&#8208;40%/LFP showed high delivered specific capacity and good stability (166.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 106 cycles at 0.2&#8197;C). Such glyme doped polymer network electrolyte provides new experimental findings for developing polymer&#8208;based electrolyte with excellent mechanical integrity and battery related properties.

         <title>Surface modification, topographic design and applications of superhydrophobic systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The superhydrophobic surface with expanded wetting behaviors, like tunable adhesion, hybrids surface hydrophobicity and smart hydrophobic switching etc., have attracted increasing attention due to their broad applications. The construction method, mechanism and advanced applications of special superhydrophobicity are reviewed, and the hydro/superhydrophobic modification are categorized and discussed based on their surface chemistry, and topographic design. The formation and maintenance of special superhydrophobicity at the meta&#8208;stable state are examined and explored. In addition, particular attention is paid to the utilization of special wettability in various applications, such as membrane distillation, droplet&#8208;based electricity generator and anti&#8208;fogging surfaces. Finally, the challenges for practical applications and future research directions are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>The Transformation of Inorganic to Organic Carbonates: Chasing for Reaction Pathways in Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanochemical reactions are solvent&#8208;free alternatives to solution&#8208;based syntheses enabling even conventionally&#8208;impossible transformations. Their reaction pathways, however, usually remain unexplored within the heavily vibrating, dense milling vessels. Here, we showcase how the green organic solvent diethyl carbonate is synthesized mechanochemically from inorganic alkali carbonates and how the complementary combination of milling parameter studies, synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction real time monitoring, and quantum chemical calculations reveal the underlying reaction pathways. With this, reaction intermediates are identified, and chemical concepts of solution&#8208;chemistry are challenged or corroborated for mechanochemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionic &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH) Nanocrystal Stabilized by Small Isopolymolybdate Clusters as Reactive Core for Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>At near neutral to basic pH, hydrolysis induced aggregation to insoluble bulk iron&#8208;oxide is often regarded as the pitfalls of molecular iron clusters. Iron&#8208;oxide nanocrystals are encouragingly active over the molecular clusters and/or bulk oxides albeit, stabilizing such nanostructures in aqueous pH and under turnover condition remain a perdurable challenge. Herein, an Anderson&#160;[Mo7O24]6&#8208; isopolyanion, a small (0.85 nm) isolable polyoxometalate (POM) possessing only {31} atoms, has been introduced for the first time as a covalent linker to stabilize an infinitely stable and aqueous&#8208;soluble &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH) nanocore. During the hydrothermal isolation of the material, a partial dissociation of the parent [Mo7O24]6&#8208; may lead to the in&#8208;situ generation of few analogous [MoxOy]n&#8208; clusters, proved by Raman study, which can also participate in stabilizing the &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH) nanocore, MoxOy@FeO(OH). However, due to high ionic charge on {Mo=O} terminals of the [MoxOy]n&#8208;, they are covalently linked via MoVI&#8208;&#181;2O&#8208;FeIII bridging to &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH) core in MoxOy@FeO(OH), established by numerous spectroscopic and microscopic evidences. Such bonding mode is more likely as precedent from the coordination motif documented in the transition metal clusters stabilized by this POM. The &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH) nanocore of MoxOy@FeO(OH) behaves as potent active center for electrochemical water oxidation with a overpotential, 263 mV @ 10 mA cm&#8208;2, lower than that observed for bare &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH). Despite of some molybdenum dissolution from the POM ligands to the electrolyte, residual anionic POM fragments covalently bound to the OER active &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH) core of the MoxOy@FeO(OH) makes the surface predominantly ionic that results in an ordered electrical double layer to promote a better charge transport across the electrode&#8208;electrolyte junction, less likely in bulk &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH).</dc:description>

This represents the first EDA&#8208;based thiolation method not relying on &#960;&#8722;&#960; or a thiolate&#8208;anion&#8208;&#960; interactions and provides a readily access to heteroarene radicals, which can be suitably trapped by disulfide derivatives to form the corresponding versatile arylsulfides. Mechanistic investigations on the aspects of the whole process have been conducted by spectroscopic measurements, demonstrating the hypothesized EDA complex formation. Moreover, the strength of this method has been proven by a gram&#8208;scale experiment and the late stage derivatization of an anticoagulant drug.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Mechanism of H/D Exchange for Isobutane on H&#8208;BEA by Loading Zn Species in Zeolite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Kinetics of H/D hydrogen exchange between deuterated isobutane&#8208;  d  10  and Br&#248;nsted acid sites (BAS) of three zeolite samples (H&#8208;BEA, ZnO/H&#8208;BEA, Zn  2+  /H&#8208;BEA) were monitored with  1  H MAS NMR in situ at 343&#8211;468 K. The regioselective H/D exchange in the methyl groups detected on H&#8208;BEA can be rationalized in terms of the mechanism of indirect exchange, which involves protonation of the intermediate olefin and further hydride abstraction from the other alkane molecule by the formed carbenium ion. Loading of Zn species in zeolite results in decrease of the rate and increase of the activation energy of the exchange. The loaded Zn species provide the tuning effect on the reaction occurrence, changing the mechanism from the indirect one to the mechanism of the direct exchange.</dc:description>

         <title>A Porous Polyaromatic Solid for Vapor Adsorption of Xylene with High Efficiency, Selectivity, and Reusability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new porous polyaromatic solid displays unusual vapor adsorption behavior toward VOCs under ambient conditions, such as vapor adsorption of benzene over cyclohexane with 90&#8201;% selectivity, high affinity toward o&#8208;xylene over benzene and toluene with &gt;80&#8201;% selectivity, and ortho&#8208;selective adsorption ability (&gt;50&#8201;%) from mixed xylene isomers.







Abstract
Development of porous materials capable of capturing volatile organic compounds (VOCs), such as benzene and its derivatives, with high efficiency, selectivity, and reusability is highly demanded. Here we report unusual vapor adsorption behavior toward VOCs by a new porous solid, composed of a polyaromatic capsule bearing a spherical nanocavity with subnano&#8208;sized windows. Without prior crystallization and high&#8208;temperature vacuum drying, the porous polyaromatic solid exhibits the following five features: vapor adsorption of benzene over cyclohexane with 90&#8201;% selectivity, high affinity toward o&#8208;xylene over benzene and toluene with &gt;80&#8201;% selectivity, ortho&#8208;selective adsorption ability (&gt;50&#8201;%) from mixed xylene isomers, tight VOCs storage even under high temperature and vacuum conditions, and at least 5&#8197;times reusability for xylene adsorption. The observed adsorption abilities are accomplished at ambient temperature and pressure within 1&#8197;h, which has not been demonstrated by organic/inorganic porous materials reported previously.

         <title>Functional Nanomaterial&#8208;Modified Anodes in Microbial Fuel Cells: Advances and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Profiting from superior electrical properties, porosity, specific surface area and biocompatibility, nanomaterials show tremendous potential in promoting the power supply of microbial fuel cells. This Review provides an outline of recent progress on anode modification nanomaterials in microbial fuel cells from the viewpoint of different binding modes of bacteria and materials.







Abstract
Microbial fuel cell (MFC) is a promising approach that could utilize microorganisms to oxidize biodegradable pollutants in wastewater and generate electrical power simultaneously. Introducing advanced anode nanomaterials is generally considered as an effective way to enhance MFC performance by increasing bacterial adhesion and facilitating extracellular electron transfer (EET). This review focuses on the key advances of recent anode modification materials, as well as the current understanding of the microbial EET process occurring at the bacteria&#8208;electrode interface. Based on the difference in combination mode of the exoelectrogens and nanomaterials, anode surface modification, hybrid biofilm construction and single&#8208;bacterial surface modification strategies are elucidated exhaustively. The inherent mechanisms may help to break through the performance output bottleneck of MFCs by rational design of EET&#8208;related nanomaterials, and lead to the widespread application of microbial electrochemical systems.

         <title>Nonsymmetric [Pt(C^N*N&#8242;^C&#8242;)] Complexes: Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission in the Solid State and in Nanoparticles Tuned by Ligand Structure</title>

         <dc:description>
Square&#8208;planar PtII complexes with tetradentate nonsymmetric {C^N*N&#8242;^C&#8242;} ligands display aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) in the solid state and in nanoparticles formed upon mixing of their solutions in THF with water. The ability of the complexes to show AIE is determined by the steric and electronic properties of the ligands&#8217; aromatic systems.







Abstract
Five square&#8208;planar [Pt(C^N*N&#8242;^C&#8242;)] complexes (Pt1&#8211;Pt5) with novel nonsymmetric tetradentate ligands (L1&#8211;L5) were synthesized and characterized. Varying the structure of the metalating aromatic systems result in substantial changes in photophysical properties and intermolecular interaction mode of the complexes in solution and in solid state. The complexes are strongly emissive in tetrahydrofuran solution, with the band maxima ranging from 560 to 690&#8197;nm. Three of these complexes (Pt1, Pt2, Pt4) afford nanospecies upon injection of their solution into water, which show aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) with a strong red shift of emission bands. In the solid state, crystalline samples of these complexes demonstrate mechanochromism upon grinding with a bathochromic shift of the emission. DFT and TD&#8208;DFT computational analysis of monomeric Pt1&#8211;Pt5 in solution and model dimeric emitters formed through intermolecular interaction of Pt1, Pt2, Pt4 molecules allowed assignment of observed AIE to the 3MMLCT excited states of Pt&#8208;Pt bonded aggregates of these complexes.

         <title>Synthesis of Highly Accessible and Reactive Sites in Gold Nanoparticles Using Bound Bis(Diphenylphosphine) Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis(diphenylphosphine) ligands are used to stabilize gold nanoparticles in solution. 2&#8208;napthalenethiol titrations are used to measure the number of accessible sites on the nanoparticle surfaces. The most accessible nanoparticle has 61&#8201;% of the total gold atoms available for binding. The resazurin reduction rate scales with the number of binding sites.







Abstract
While bound organic ligands provide steric protection against aggregation for metallic nanoparticles in solution, they can block a large fraction of the surface atoms which are needed for binding in catalysis and sensing applications. In this work, highly accessible Au nanoparticles ligated with bis(diphenylphosphine) molecules are synthesized and characterized in solution. Characterization is performed using high angle annular dark field&#8208;scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF&#8208;STEM), ultraviolet&#8208;visible (UV&#8208;Vis) spectroscopy, and fluorescence chemisorption experiments. These synthesized nanoparticles are accessible to a 2&#8208;napthalenethiol (2&#8208;NT) probe molecule in solution. The highest 2&#8208;NT accessibility is observed when using 1,1&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)methane (dppm) ligand where 61&#8201;% of the total gold atoms are accessible. It is hypothesized that increasing the rigidity of the bis(diphenylphosphine) ligand increases the number of binding sites on the Au nanoparticles. These nanoparticles are catalytically active for resazurin reduction, and the resazurin reduction rate scales with the number of binding sites.

Characterization is performed using high angle annular dark field-scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, and fluorescence chemisorption experiments. These synthesized nanoparticles are accessible to a 2-napthalenethiol (2-NT) probe molecule in solution. The highest 2-NT accessibility is observed when using 1,1-bis(diphenylphosphino)methane (dppm) ligand where 61&#8201;% of the total gold atoms are accessible. It is hypothesized that increasing the rigidity of the bis(diphenylphosphine) ligand increases the number of binding sites on the Au nanoparticles. These nanoparticles are catalytically active for resazurin reduction, and the resazurin reduction rate scales with the number of binding sites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Access to Enantiomerically Pure P&#8208;Stereogenic Primary Aminophosphine Sulfides under Reductive Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A route to enantiomerically pure P&#8208;stereogenic primary aminophosphine sulfides by reductive C&#8722;N bond cleavage with lithium in liquid ammonia is presented. Undesirable side reactions during the cleavage can be suppressed by using aliphatic substitution patterns. Quantum chemical and spectroscopic insights into a complex of a chiral primary aminophosphine sulfide and the lithium salt of (R)&#8208;BINOL&#8208;PSSH in solution was provided.







Abstract
Stereochemically pure phosphines with phosphorus&#8208;heteroatom bonds and P&#8208;centered chirality are a promising class of functional building blocks for the design of chiral ligands and organocatalysts. A route to enantiomerically pure primary aminophosphine sulfides was opened through stereospecific reductive C&#8722;N bond cleavage of phosphorus(V) precursors by lithium in liquid ammonia. The chemoselectivity of the reaction as a function of reaction time, substrate pattern, and chiral auxiliary was investigated. In the presence of exclusively aliphatic groups bound to the phosphorus atom, all competing reductive side reactions are totally prevented. The absolute configurations of all P&#8208;stereogenic compounds were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Their use as synthetic building blocks was demonstrated. The lithium salt of (R)&#8208;BINOL&#8208;dithiophosphoric acid proved to be a useful stereochemical probe to determine the enantiomeric purity. Insights into the coordination mode of the lithium&#8208;based chiral complex formed in solution was provided by NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations.

         <title>Oxidation of an Internal&#8208;Edge&#8208;Substituted [5]Helicene&#8208;Derived Phosphine Synchronously Enhances Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Laterally &#960;&#8208;extended 7,8&#8208;dihydro[5]helicenes bearing phosphine and phosphine oxide groups on their inner helical rims were synthesized, and their photophysical and chiroptical properties were analyzed. As expected, the phosphine oxide showed a markedly enhanced circularly polarized luminescence response compared with that of the corresponding phosphine.







Abstract
Small chiral organic molecules with CD properties are in high demanded due to their potential use in promising electronic and biological applications. Herein, we reveal a system in which the oxidation of a phosphino group to the corresponding phosphine oxide on the inner rim of a helicene derivative induces a CPL response. Laterally &#960;&#8208;extended 7,8&#8208;dihydro[5]helicenes bearing phosphine and phosphine oxide groups on their inner helical rims (i.&#8201;e., the C1 position) were synthesized, and their helical structures were unambiguously determined by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The photophysical (UV/visible and emission) and chiroptical properties of these compounds were investigated in various solvents. Despite their structural similarities, phosphine oxide showed a significantly better CPL response than phosphine, with a high dissymmetry factor for emission (|glum|=(1.3&#8211;1.9)&#215;10&#8722;3) that can be attributed to structural changes in the interior of the helicene helix.

         <title>Isolation of Homo&#8208;/Mixed&#8208;Valence Ag12, Ag29, and Ag8 Clusters Stabilized by Cyclic Alkyl(amino) Carbene&#8208;Anchored Monoanionic Phosphorus Ligand</title>

Silver stableware: We have demonstrated the first syntheses and solid&#8208;state isolation of three unprecedented silver clusters [((cAAC)P)6Ag12Cl3](OTf)3 (1), [((cAAC)P)6Ag29] (2), and [((cAAC)P)4Ag8] (3) by employing cyclic alkyl(amino) carbene (cAAC)&#8208;supported phosphinidenide (cAACP&#8722;) generated in&#8197;situ as the stabilizing ligand from the corresponding phosphaalkene and potassium phosphinidenide, respectively.







Abstract
Silver clusters are attractive candidates for their promising optical properties, and biomedical activities. Herein, we report on the first syntheses and isolation of three homo&#8208;/mixed&#8208;valence silver nanoclusters (NCs) with Ag12Cl3, Ag29, and Ag8 cores [((cAAC)P)6Ag12Cl3](OTf)3 (1), [((cAAC)P)6Ag29] (2), and [((cAAC)P)4Ag8] (3) having three&#8208;/twofold symmetry, employing cyclic alkyl(amino) carbene (cAAC)&#8208;supported phosphinidenide (cAACP&#8722;) as the &#960;&#8208;accepting stabilizing ligand. The average diameters of Ag NCs 1, and 2 are approximately 1.6 to 2&#8197;nm. The redox non&#8208;innocent mono&#8208;atomic phosphorus anions (P&#8722;) anchored with cAAC ligands are generated in&#8197;situ by the reaction of AgOTf with a boryl&#8208;phosphaalkene (cAAC)P&#8722;B(NiPr2)2 through cleavage of the P&#8722;B bond with the help of a triflate anion (OTf&#8722;) as a weak nucleophile. Equivalent number of the (cAAC)P&#8722; anions generated in&#8197;situ are oxidized to produce the corresponding bis&#8208;phosphinidene (cAAC)2P2 leading to the generation of Ag0 ions in solution for the formation of the unprecedented mixed&#8208;valence Ag NC 2. Complex 3 is achieved by treating potassium phosphinidenide cAACPK with AgNTf2. The ligand field and the steric hindrance of the (cAAC)P units play crucial roles in stabilizing complexes 1&#8211;3, further providing a three&#8208; (1, 2)/two&#8208; (3) fold stand. The Ag12Cl3 NC (1) with a tricationic core [AgI12Cl3] was found to be diamagnetic, and fluorescent, emitting green light at 563&#8197;nm when excited at 400&#8197;nm. In contrast, the neutral Ag29 (2) and Ag8 (3) clusters were found to be paramagnetic, and NMR silent showing characteristic EPR signals for Ag0 at room temperature.

         <title>Microporous Framework (Nb, Fe)&#8208;Silicate with Much Potential to Remove Rare&#8208;Earth Elements from Waters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoparticles of a new small&#8208;pore metal silicate, Na2.9(Nb1.55Fe0.45)Si2O10&#8901;xH2O, have been synthesized under mild hydrothermal conditions. Replacement of the bulky Rb+ by smaller Na+ ions required stabilizing the framework via partial occupancy of the Nb5+ sites by Fe3+ ions. The material is stable up to almost 500&#8201;&#176;C. Ion exchange assays show its considerable potential to remove rare&#8208;earth elements from aqueous solutions.







Abstract
Nanoparticles of a new small&#8208;pore metal silicate formulated as Na2.9(Nb1.55Fe0.45)Si2O10&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xH2O and exhibiting the structure of previously reported Rb2(Nb2O4)(Si2O6)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O have been synthesized under mild hydrothermal conditions. Replacement of the bulky Rb+ by smaller Na+ ions was accomplished by stabilizing the framework structure via partial occupancy of the Nb5+ sites by Fe3+ ions. Exploratory ion&#8208;exchange assays evidence the considerable potential of this new silicate to remove rare&#8208;earth elements from aqueous solutions.

Replacement of the bulky Rb&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; by smaller Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions required stabilizing the framework via partial occupancy of the Nb&lt;sup&gt;5+&lt;/sup&gt; sites by Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. The material is stable up to almost 500&#8201;&#176;C. Ion exchange assays show its considerable potential to remove rare-earth elements from aqueous solutions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanoparticles of a new small-pore metal silicate formulated as Na&lt;sub&gt;2.9&lt;/sub&gt;(Nb&lt;sub&gt;1.55&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;0.45&lt;/sub&gt;)Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and exhibiting the structure of previously reported Rb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)(Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O have been synthesized under mild hydrothermal conditions. Replacement of the bulky Rb&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; by smaller Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions was accomplished by stabilizing the framework structure via partial occupancy of the Nb&lt;sup&gt;5+&lt;/sup&gt; sites by Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. Exploratory ion-exchange assays evidence the considerable potential of this new silicate to remove rare-earth elements from aqueous solutions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Butterfly&#8208;Shaped Nanographenes with Excellent Second Order Nonlinear Optical Properties: the Synergy of B/N and Azulene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Azulene, a simple polar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with connected electron donor and acceptor (DA), ignites the hope to design second order nonlinear optical (NLO) molecular materials from pure nonpolar carbon nanomaterials. In the present work, by incorporating azulene between two coronenes, a butterfly&#8208;shaped nanographene (&#960;&#8208;DA&#8208;&#960;) is designed. One more electron in a N atom or one less electron in a B atom with respect to a C atom can polarize charge distribution in carbon nanomaterials, and further doping of B and N in the designed butterfly&#8208;shaped nanographene change the system from &#960;&#8208;DA&#8208;&#960; to D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A, leading to strong NLO responses, e.g., the largest static first hyperpolarizability even reaches 173.89&#215;10&#8722;30 esu per heavy atom. The synergetic role of B, N and azulene in the nanographene is scrutinized, and such doping strategy provides an effective means for carbon&#8208;based functional materials design. The strong second order NLO responses of these butterfly&#8208;shaped carbon&#8208;based nanographenes under external fields, e.g., sum frequency generation and difference frequency generation, inspire future experimental exploration.</dc:description>

         <title>Bimetallic CuSbSe2: A potential anode material for sodium and lithium&#8208;ion batteries with high&#8208;rate capability and long&#8208;term stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bimetallic transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) materials have emerged as attractive anodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) because of the high intrinsic electronic conductivity, rich redox sites and unique reaction mechanisms. In this work, we report the synthesis and electrochemical properties of a novel bimetallic TMCs material CuSbSe2. The as&#8208;prepared anode delivers a high reversible capacity of 545.6 mA h g&#8722;1 for SIBs and 592.6 mA h g&#8722;1 for LIBs at a current density of 0.2 A g&#8722;1, and an excellent rate capability of 425.9 mA h g&#8722;1 at 20 A g&#8722;1 for SIBs and 226.0 mA h g&#8722;1 at 10 A g&#8722;1 for LIBs without any common&#8208;used surface modification or carbonaceous compositing. In addition, ex situ XRD and HRTEM reveal a combined conversion&#8208;alloying reaction mechanism of LIBs and NIBs. Our findings suggest bimetallic CuSbSe2 anode could be a potential anode material for both SIBs and LIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalysed Carbene Transfer to Isocyanides as a Platform for Heterocycle Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An iron&#8208;catalysed carbene transfer reaction of diazo compounds to isocyanides is developed. The resulting ketenimines are trapped in situ with various bisnucleophiles to access a range of densely functionalized heterocycles (i.e., pyrimidinones, dihydropyrazolones, 1H&#8208;tetrazoles) in a one&#8208;pot process. The electron&#8208;rich Hieber anion ([Fe(CO)3NO]&#8722;) facilitates efficient catalytic carbene transfer from acceptor&#8208;type &#945;&#8208;diazo carbonyl compounds to isocyanides, providing a cost&#8208;efficient and benign alternative to similar noble metal&#8208;catalysed processes. Based on DFT calculations a plausible reaction mechanism for activation of the &#945;&#8208;diazo carbonyl carbene precursor and ketenimine formation is provided.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereodivergent Total Syntheses of (+)&#8208;Mycaperoxides C, D, G Methyl Ester and (&#8208;)&#8208;Mycaperoxide B</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mycaperoxides are natural endoperoxides isolated from different Mycale genus sponges, showing significant antiviral or antibacterial activities. We report herein the first total syntheses of representative congeners of this family from sclareol using a stereodivergent approach. Thus, an innovative oxidative ring expansion of cyclobutanol was used to bring the 1,2&#8208;dioxane subunit, and a Mukaiyama aldol reaction on peroxycarbenium species was utilized to install the propionic acid subunit. During the study toward (+)&#8208;mycaperoxide D methyl ester (2), the isolation of the eight possible diastereomers under their ethyl thioester form allowed us to build a pertinent database for further NMR assignment studies. Thus, we completed the total syntheses of (+)&#8208;mycaperoxides D, C, G methyl ester, and (&#8208;)&#8208;mycaperoxide B in 11 to 15 steps, confirming their original assignment.</dc:description>

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Luminescence Materials with Multiple Emission Colour and Near&#8208;Unity Quantum Yield</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing of solid luminescent materials with unity quantum yield and tunable emission color is promising, which is still a difficult task. Herein, a straightforward heat treatment method is developed to load 3, 4, 9, 10&#8208;perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) into the matrix of boric acid (BA), producing powders with a near&#8208;unity quantum yield and tunable emission color from yellow to green. Our results suggest that the emission of powder originates from PTCDA, and the tunable emission color is caused by the hydrolysis of PTCDA in the alkaline environment. The near&#8208;unity quantum yield is attributed to BA matrix, which provide confinement effect to PTCDA. In addition, the powder also shows excellent thermal stability, which allows its applications in light&#8208;emitting diodes. Above results are important for the development of solid&#8208;state luminescent materials for various applications, and it also provide a clue to study the emission properties of luminescent materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Propeller, Linear, Cruciform &amp; Stellate Spirobicarbazolium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A general synthetic approach of substituted tetraaryl&#8208;ammonium salts has been developed and illustrated crystallographically. Halo derivatives&#160;  1  m/p  &#8208;X  &#160;to&#160;  4  m/p  &#8208;X  &#160;(X =F, Cl, Br)&#160; being used as common synthetic intermediates. Suzuki coupling of these bromides with a family of boronic acids provided a&#160;reduction&#160;to practice of this strategy for arylation. Resolution of the C  2  &#160;subset&#160;  2*   m/p  &#8208;R  &#160; led to the first examples of enantiopure spirobicarbazoliums and the assignment of their absolute configuration by comparison of computational and experimental ECD spectra. An ECD comparison with Prelog&#8217;s spirobifluorenes is provided. In the case of&#160;  2*  m  &#8208;Br  , absolute configuration was confirmed by anomalous scattering. Cruciform and stellate tetra&#8208;substituted salts&#160;  4   m/p  &#8208;X  &#160;provide a test of the limits of the methodology and their structures suggest them as candidates for MOF building blocks.</dc:description>

         <title>Long&#8208;Term, Single&#8208;Molecule Imaging of Proteins in Live Cells with Photoregulated Fluxional Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational tuning of molecular properties delivered fluxional fluorophores that blink spontaneously upon photoisomerization. The compatibility of these probes with the self&#8208;labeling protein HaloTag enabled single&#8208;molecule imaging of specific molecular targets in live cells for exceptionally long periods of time.







Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) can reveal nanometric details of biological samples, but its high phototoxicity hampers long&#8208;term imaging in live specimens. A significant part of this phototoxicity stems from repeated irradiations that are necessary for controlled switching of fluorophores to maintain the sparse labeling of the sample. Lower phototoxicity can be obtained using fluorophores that blink spontaneously, but controlling the density of single&#8208;molecule emitters is challenging. We recently developed photoregulated fluxional fluorophores (PFFs) that combine the benefits of spontaneously blinking dyes with photocontrol of emitter density. These dyes, however, were limited to imaging acidic organelles in live cells. Herein, we report a systematic study of PFFs that culminates in probes that are functional at physiological pH and operate at longer wavelengths than their predecessors. Moreover, these probes are compatible with HaloTag labeling, thus enabling timelapse, single&#8208;molecule imaging of specific protein targets for exceptionally long times.

         <title>Catalytic Nitrene Transfer by an FeIV&#8208;Imido Complex Generated by a Comproportionation Process</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An FeIV imide of a tetracarbene macrocycle active in nitrene transfer reactions can be generated from phenyltosyliodinane (PhI=NTs) either from the FeII precursor by oxidative addition (right) or from the FeIII precursor by a comproportionation reaction (left) (AN=acetonitrile, bold horizontal bars=macrocycle).







Abstract
Nitrene transfer reactions have emerged as one of the most powerful and versatile ways to insert an amine function to various kinds of hydrocarbon substrates. However, the mechanisms of nitrene generation have not been studied in depth albeit their formation is taken for granted in most cases without definitive evidence of their occurrence. In the present work, we compare the generation of tosylimido iron species and NTs transfer from FeII and FeIII precursors where the metal is embedded in a tetracarbene macrocycle. Catalytic nitrene transfer to reference substrates (thioanisole, styrene, ethylbenzene and cyclohexane) revealed that the same active species was at play, irrespective of the ferrous versus ferric nature of the precursor. Through combination of spectroscopic (UV&#8208;visible, M&#246;ssbauer), ESI&#8208;MS and DFT studies, an FeIV tosylimido species was identified as the catalytically active species and was characterized spectroscopically and computationally. Whereas its formation from the FeII precursor was expected by a two&#8208;electron oxidative addition, its formation from an FeIII precursor was unprecedented. Thanks to a combination of spectroscopic (UV&#8208;visible, EPR, Hyscore and M&#246;ssbauer), ESI&#8208;MS and DFT studies, we found that, when starting from the FeIII precursor, an FeIII tosyliodinane adduct was formed and decomposed into an FeV tosylimido species which generated the catalytically active FeIV tosylimide through a comproportionation process with the FeIII precursor.

         <title>Chiral Primary Amine Catalyzed &#945;&#8208;Arylation of Simple Ketones via Asymmetric Retro&#8208;Claisen Cleavage</title>

C&#8722;C cleavage to arylation. Enantioselective &#945;&#8208;arylation of simple aliphatic ketones has been achieved via chiral primary amine catalyzed asymmetric retro&#8208;Claisen cleavage involving &#946;&#8208;diketones and para&#8208;quinone monoimines that facilitates the construction of &#945;&#8208;aryl tertiary carbon stereocenters in good yields and high enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Highly enantioselective &#945;&#8208;arylation of simple ketones has been achieved by chiral primary amine catalyzed asymmetric retro&#8208;Claisen cleavage of &#946;&#8208;diketones. This mild organocatalytic strategy enables the construction of &#945;&#8208;aryl tertiary carbon stereocenters in good yields and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98&#8201;% ee) with the para&#8208;quinone monoimines as aryl sources. Furthermore, oxidative catalytic asymmetric &#945;&#8208;arylation has also been realized with free p&#8208;aminophenols.

         <title>Influence of Achiral Phosphine Ligands on a Synergistic Organo&#8208; and Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Allylic Alkylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the employment of synergistic amino&#8208; and palladium catalysis, an allylic alkylation is disclosed where all four stereoisomers can be accessed as the major product. Importantly, this stereodivergence has been developed to employ the aminocatalyst as the sole chiral reagent. While the aminocatalyst dictates the enantioselectivity, diastereoselectivity is governed by the nature of an achiral, monodentate phosphine ligand on palladium.







Abstract
An unusual diastereodivergent stereoselective allylation reaction is presented. It consists of a palladium&#8208;catalyzed allylation reaction of an organocatalytically generated amino isobenzofulvene, where the diastereoselectivity is controlled by the electronic properties of a monodentate, achiral ligand on palladium. One major diastereoisomer is formed using triarylphosphines substituted with neutral or electron&#8208;donating substituents of the aryl group, while those with electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents favor the other diastereoisomer. The diastereoselectivity correlates with the Taft inductive parameter of substituents on the triarylphosphine ligand on palladium. The synergistic reaction involves both a catalytic secondary amine catalyst for the indene&#8208;aldehyde activation and the monodentate phosphine ligands on palladium, affording a highly enantioselective reaction with up to 98&#8201;% enantiomeric excess. Based on computational investigations, the role of the monodentate phosphine ligand on the diastereoselectivity is discussed.

         <title>Evolution of a Synthetic Strategy for Garsubellin A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective total synthesis of garsubellin&#8197;A establishes the absolute stereostructure of the plant&#8208;derived meroterpene that enhances the choline acetyltransferase enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. The 12&#8208;step, protecting group&#8208;free synthesis features the use of a 1,3&#8208;dithiolane for efficient construction of the bridged and fused ring system.







Abstract
Garsubellin&#8197;A is a thirty&#8208;carbon meroterpenoid capable of enhancing the enzyme choline acetyltransferase whose decreased level is associated with the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Due to the potentially useful biological activity along with the novel molecular architecture, this plant metabolite has remained a popular synthetic target. Herein we report a full account of our synthetic investigations that have led to the enantioselective total synthesis of garsubellin&#8197;A, establishing its absolute stereostructure. The protecting group&#8208;free, twelve&#8208;step synthetic route has enabled the syntheses of the natural (&#8722;)&#8208;garsubellin&#8197;A and its unnatural (+)&#8208;antipode.

         <title>Studies towards the Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Dictyoxetane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Hajos&#8208;Parrish ketone is used to prepare a key building block for the total synthesis of the marine natural product dictyoxetane in enantiopure form. A synthetic alternative to the Garst&#8208;Spencer furan annelation is developed, and the reactivity and diastereoselectivity of the resulting tetrasubstituted chiral furan in cycloaddition reactions towards an appropriately functionalised carbocyclic core of dictyoxetane are explored.







Abstract
The dolabellane&#8208;type diterpene dictyoxetane represents a significant challenge to synthetic organic chemistry. Methodology directed towards the total synthesis of naturally occurring (+)&#8208;dictyoxetane is reported. Catalytic asymmetric synthesis of the trans&#8208;hydrindane ring system is achieved through chemoselective deoxygenation of the Hajos&#8208;Parrish ketone. An alternative to the Garst&#8208;Spencer furan annulation is developed for the synthesis of a 2,5&#8208;dimethyl, tetrasubstituted furan, employing a tandem 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig alcohol to alkyne cyclisation/aromatisation reaction as a key step. The (4+3) cycloaddition reaction of an oxyallyl cation with a tetrasubstituted furan is established on a cyclohexanone&#8208;derived model system, and a range of related (4+3) cycloadditions investigated on a homochiral, trans&#8208;hydrindane&#8208;fused furan, where regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity is required for the natural product synthesis. In an alternative (4+2) Diels&#8208;Alder approach, a C2&#8208;symmetric vinyl sulfoxide&#8208;based chiral ketene equivalent is used to prepare oxanorbornenes with the same oxygen bridge stereochemistry found in the 2,7&#8208;dioxatricyclo[4.2.1.03,8]nonane ring system of the natural product.

         <title>Theoretical and Experimental Investigation of Functionalized Cyanopyridines Yield an Anolyte with an Extremely Low Reduction Potential for Nonaqueous Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyanopyridines are reduced at low potentials in organic solvents and are therefore a promising class of molecules for anolytes for nonaqueous redox&#8208;flow batteries (RFBs). Quantum computations suggest that properly placed phenyl and methyl substituents shift the reduction potentials even lower than those of the parent cyanopyridines and prevent dimerization of the radical anions. The optimal molecule has a reduction potential in CH3CN of &#8722;2.50&#8197;V vs. Fc+/0, the lowest reported for a RFB anolyte.







Abstract
Cyanopyridines and cyanophenylpyridines were investigated as anolytes for nonaqueous redox flow batteries (RFBs). The three isomers of cyanopyridine are reduced at potentials of &#8722;2.2&#8197;V or lower vs. ferrocene+/0 (Fc+/0), but the 3&#8208;CNPy&#8901;&#8722; radical anion forms a sigma&#8208;dimer that is re&#8208;oxidized at E&#8776;&#8722;1.1&#8197;V, which would lead to poor voltaic efficiency in a RFB. Bulk electrochemical charge&#8208;discharge cycling of the cyanopyridines in acetonitrile and 0.50&#8197;M [NBu4][PF6] shows that 2&#8208;CNPy and 4&#8208;CNPy lose capacity quickly under these conditions, due to irreversible chemical reaction/decomposition of the radical anions. Density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that adding a phenyl group to the cyanopyridines would, for some isomers, limit dimerization and improve the stability of the radical anions, while shifting their E1/2 only about +0.10&#8197;V relative to the parent cyanopyridines. Among the cyanophenylpyridines, 3&#8208;CN&#8208;6&#8208;PhPy and 3&#8208;CN&#8208;4&#8208;PhPy are the most promising as anolytes. They exhibit reversible reductions at E1/2=&#8722;2.19 and &#8722;2.22&#8197;V vs. ferrocene+/0, respectively, and retain about half of their capacity after 30&#8197;bulk charge&#8208;discharge cycles. An improved version of 3&#8208;CN&#8208;6&#8208;PhPy with three methyl groups (3&#8208;cyano&#8208;4&#8208;methyl&#8208;6&#8208;(3,5&#8208;dimethylphenyl)pyridine) has an extremely low reduction potential of &#8722;2.50&#8197;V vs. Fc+/0 (the lowest reported for a nonaqueous RFB anolyte) and loses only 0.21&#8201;% of capacity per cycle during charge&#8208;discharge cycling in acetonitrile.

         <title>The Core/Shell Structure P Doped MoS2@Ni3S2 Nanorods Array for High Current Density Hydrogen Evolution in Alkaline and Acidic Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The P doped MoS2@Ni3S2 nanorods array with core/shell structure was prepared through successive sulfuration and phosphorization strategies, which exhibits close catalytic activity to Pt/C, the overpotential is only 290&#8197;mV at 250&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Electrocatalysis is the most promising strategy to generate clean energy H2, and the development of catalysts with excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance at high current density that can resist strong alkaline and acidic electrolyte environment is of great significance for practical industrial application. Therefore, a P doped MoS2@Ni3S2 nanorods array (named P&#8208;NiMoS) was successfully synthesized through successive sulfuration and phosphorization. P&#8208;NiMoS presents a core/shell structure with a heterojunction between MoS2 (shell) and Ni3S2 (core). Furthermore, the doping of P modulates the electronic structure of the P&#8208;NiMoS; the electrons transfer from the t2g orbital of Ni element to the eg empty orbital of Mo element through the Ni&#8722;S&#8722;Mo bond at the Ni3S2 and MoS2 heterojunction, facilitating the hydrogen evolution reaction. As a result, P&#8208;NiMoS exhibits excellent HER activity; the overpotential is 290&#8197;mV at high current density of 250&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline electrolyte, which is close to Pt/C (282&#8197;mV@250&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), and P&#8208;NiMoS can stably evolve hydrogen for 48&#8197;h.

Two 3D organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid ABX3 perovskite structures constructed with [RbX6] (X=Br, I) octahedra by sharing corner or face can accommodate the large spherical organic molecule 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[3.2.2]nonane using the different cavities in their inorganic frameworks.







Abstract
The emergence of (CH3NH3)PbI3 has brought the development of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite (OIHP) structures with ABX3 type to a higher level; however, most 3D frameworks are constructed by corner&#8208;sharing of BX6 octahedra. Herein, we substituted the spherical molecule 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (2.2.2&#8208;dabco) with 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[3.2.2]nonane (1,4&#8208;3.2.2&#8208;dabcn) as a template to react with RbX (X=Br, I) in the corresponding HX acids under the consideration of reducing the molecular symmetry. Two 3D OIHP compounds [1,4&#8208;3.2.2&#8208;H2dabcn]RbI3&#8901;H2O (1) and [1,4&#8208;3.2.2&#8208;H2dabcn]RbBr3 (2) crystallized in non&#8208;centrosymmetric point group mm2 before the phase transition point were isolated. Among them, the 3D inorganic framework of 1 is constructed by sharing the corner of [RbI6] octahedra, while that of 2 is constructed by sharing the corner and face of [RbBr6] octahedra to acquire large cavities to accommodate the organic amine cation [1,4&#8208;3.2.2&#8208;H2dabcn]2+; this 3D framework type is unprecedented in the OIHPs. As expected, compounds 1 and 2 exhibit reversible phase transition, dielectric and second harmonic generation (SHG) and ferroelectric properties, in which the phase transition temperature of 2 at 374&#8197;K is much higher than compound 1 at 280&#8197;K.

         <title>Recent Status and Developments of Vacancies Modulation in the ABO3 Perovskites for Catalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perovskite oxides (ABO3) have attracted comprehensive interest for wide range of functional applications (especially for chemical catalysis) due to their high design flexibility, controllable vacancies sites creation, abundant chemical properties, and stable crystal structure. Herein, the previous research and potential development of ABO3 through adjusting the vacancy at different sites (A&#8208;site, B&#8208;site, and O&#8208;site) to enhance catalytic performance are systematically analyzed and generalized. Briefly, the ABO3 with different vacancies sites prepared by multifarious direct and indirect methods, accompanied with the improved physical&#8208;chemical properties, endow them with distinct and intensified development of catalysis application. In addition, the impressive optimization proved by the vacancies sites adjustment over the ABO3 is studied to continuously facilitate the advance in some common catalysis reactions, further expanding to other optimized functional applications. At last, the constructive suggestions for fine regulation and analysis of vacancies sites over ABO3 are also put forward.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion&#8208;Driven Programmable Chiral Self&#8208;Sorting in Metal&#8208;Organic Cages and Structural Transformations between Heterochiral and Homochiral Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>When a racemic mixture of chiral building blocks self&#8208;assembles to form discrete molecular or supramolecular cages, the system can adopt either social or narcissistic chiral self&#8208;sorting. However, control over such chiral self&#8208;sorting is hard to achieve with a desired choice of outcome. Herein we report anion templated high&#8208;fidelity chiral self&#8208;sorting during the coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of [Pd2L4] metal&#8208;organic cages, with a racemic mixture of an axially chiral ligand. Upon varying the counter&#8208;anions, the outcome of the choice of chiral self&#8208;sorting, whether social or narcissistic, leading to kinetically favored heterochiral or thermodynamically favored homochiral cages, can be controlled through specific anion encapsulation. Non&#8208;encapsulating anion afforded a mixture of all possible diastereomers. Anion exchange enabled structural transformations between the diastereomers and the conversion of the mixture of diastereomers into homochiral diastereomers.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Polysubstituted Symmetrical BODIPYs via Fischer Carbene Complexes: Theoretical, Photophysical and Electrochemical Evaluation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyrrole polyfunctionalized core is obtained from Fischer alkynyl carbenes and oxazolones and used to obtain highly functionalized symmetric BODIPYs with modulating optoelectronic properties.







Abstract
A series of new symmetrical highly substituted BODIPYs 6&#8201;a&#8211;l was synthesized through a prefunctionalization approach in 35&#8201;%&#8211;89&#8201;% yields from the pyrrole core. This strategy allowed modulation of the substituents at the different positions based on the choice of Fischer's alkynyl carbenes, oxazolones and aldehydes used as precursors. The substituent variation at positions 2, 6, 3 and 5 had the greatest effect on the modulation of their photophysical properties such as absorption (&#955;abs) and emission (&#955;em) wavelengths, extinction coefficient (&#1013;), quantum yields (&#981;), Stokes shifts (&#916;&#957;), fluorescence decay, radiative (krad) and non&#8208;radiative (knr) constants and the CIE 1931 coordinates. Theoretical calculations allowed to corroborate the effect of the substituents of meso&#8208;position on the modification of the dihedral angles. Cyclic voltammetry studies revealed that the BODIPY series presents similar redox potential behavior, being electrochemically active even in successive cycles, which suggests that transport by diffusion is the dominant process.

         <title>Efficient Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Highly Stereoselective Synthesis of Unprotected C&#8208;Acyl Manno&#8208;, Rhamno&#8208; and Lyxopyranosides</title>

         <dc:description>
Just a pinch of copper iodide promotes the reaction of manno&#8208;type glycosyl iodides with lithiated dithianes. Herein, we report an efficient and highly &#945;&#8208;selective four&#8208;step one&#8208;pot method for the synthesis of unprotected manno&#8208;type C&#8208;acyl pyranosides. The crucial role of the catalyst was proven by mechanistic studies and DFT calculations, suggesting a copper&#8208;radical mechanism over a SN&#8208;type mechanism.







Abstract
Due to their high stability towards enzymatic hydrolysis C&#8208;acyl glycosidic compounds are useful synthetic intermediates for potential candidates in drug discovery. Syntheses for C&#8208;acyl mannosides have remained scarce and usually employ donors obtained from lengthy syntheses. Furthermore, syntheses of unprotected C&#8208;acyl mannosides have not been reported so far, due to the incapability of the C&#8208;acyl mannoside motif with deprotection conditions for protective groups commonly used in carbohydrate chemistry. Herein, we report an efficient and highly &#945;&#8208;selective four&#8208;step one&#8208;pot method for the synthesis of C&#8208;acyl &#945;&#8208;d&#8208;manno&#8208;, l&#8208;rhamno&#8208; and d&#8208;lyxopyranosides from easily accessible persilylated monosaccharides and dithianes requiring only trace amounts of a copper source as catalyst and explain the crucial role of the catalyst by mechanistic studies. Furthermore, the C&#8208;acyl &#945;&#8208;glycosides were easily isomerized to give rapid access to their &#946;&#8208;anomers.

         <title>Mitochondrial Targeting and Imaging with Small Organic Conjugated Fluorophores: A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive overview on reported small molecule fluorophores exploited as mitochondrial imaging materials is carried out, with particular focus on the synthetic approaches used for the different chemistries, the photophysical characteristics of the probes and their cell biology evaluation.







Abstract
The last decade has seen an increasingly large number of studies reporting on the development of novel small organic conjugated systems for mitochondrial imaging exploiting optical signal transduction pathways. Mitochondria are known to play a critical role in a number of key biological processes, including cellular metabolism. Importantly, irregularities on their working function are nowadays understood to be intimately linked to a range of clinical conditions, highlighting the importance of targeting mitochondria for therapeutic benefits. In this work we carry out an in&#8208;depth evaluation on the progress to date in the field to pave the way for the realization of superior alternatives to those currently existing. The manuscript is structured by commonly used chemical scaffolds and comprehensively covers key aspects factored in design strategies such as synthetic approaches as well as photophysical and biological characterization, to foster collaborative work among organic and physical chemists as well as cell biologists.

         <title>Effective Iodine Capture Behavior by a Censer&#8208;shaped Macrocycle in Vapor Phase and Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cyclotrixylohydroquinoylene (CTX) derivative, CTX[P(O)Ph], was reported as an efficient iodine adsorbent here. The CTX[P(O)Ph] powder exhibited high performance in both of iodine vapor adsorption and iodine aqueous solution adsorption. More importantly, two types of iodine loading crystal structures were obtained under different conditions to reveal the adsorption mechanism.







Abstract
Iodine capture is of great significance for disposal of the hazardous radioactive iodine. CTX[P(O)Ph], one kind of censer&#8208;shaped macrocycle cyclotrixylohydroquinoylene (CTX) derivatives, was applied as an efficient iodine adsorbent. It showed satisfactory iodine adsorption capacity in vapor phase and could be reused without obvious adsorption capacity loss. Besides, the adsorbent could also uptake iodine in water. Fortunately, two iodine loading CTX[P(O)Ph] crystal structures were obtained under different conditions to explore the mechanism of iodine adsorption. This work provides a relatively rare example of iodine adsorption by macrocycle. It is promising that the results with crystal information might be meaningful for exploring and designing new kinds of iodine adsorbents.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Divergent Ring&#8208;Opening Rearrangement of Cyclopropenes Enabled by Dichotomous Gold&#8722;Carbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two in One: A gold&#8208;catalyzed divergent ring&#8208;opening rearrangement of cyclopropenes has been developed for concise synthesis of structurally important polysubstituted naphthols and furans enabled by the dichotomous gold&#8722;carbenes. The use of different gold&#8208;catalysts allows for successful tuning of gold carbene reactivity or gold carbenoid reactivity in organic synthesis.







Abstract
The gold&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening rearrangement of cyclopropenes affords an efficient route to either polysubstituted naphthols or aryl&#8208;substituted furans. Owing to the unique dichotomy of gold&#8722;carbenes, this protocol provides a switchable reaction selectivity between naphthols and furans enabled by the use of TFP&#8722;Au(MeCN)SbF6 (tri(2&#8208;furyl) phosphine) or PNP(AuNTf2)2 (bis(diphenylphosphino)(isopropyl) amine) as catalysts respectively. It is proposed that the gold&#8722;carbene intermediate might be involved in the cyclopropene&#8594;naphthol rearrangement while the gold&#8208;carbocation is more likely to be involved in the cyclopropene&#8594;furan rearrangement.

         <title>Peri&#8208;Functionalized Tetraazaperylenes: Strong Emitters for Molecular Polaritonics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polaritonics with Peri Functionalized Tetraazaperylenes. Functionalization with electron donating groups leads to a class of highly fluorescent dyes, containing a tetraazaperylene core, which are excellent materials in strong light&#8208;matter coupling in resonant optical microcavities. This new class of functional dyes, whose properties can be simply tuned, showed fascinating behavior in molecular polaritonics.







Abstract
The functionalization of the peri position of the bay chlorinated tetraazaperylene was investigated by varying the donor behavior of the substituents to assess the resulting photophysical and electrochemical properties. To accomplish this, electron donating alkyl&#8208; and arylsulfido substituents, methoxy and methyl groups were selectively introduced into the peri position via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution of the perchlorinated tetraazaperylene. Both the alkylated and benzylated thioethers displayed high fluorescence quantum yields of up to 80&#8201;%. Compounds from the latter group were integrated in resonant optical microcavities to achieve strong light&#8208;matter coupling. The formation of exciton&#8208;polaritons was observed by angle&#8208;dependent reflectivity and photoluminescence that could be tuned by variation of the concentration of the fluorophores and of the thickness of the cavity.

         <title>Pushing the Limits of Nucleic Acid Function</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA and RNA molecules are capable of a wide range of functions. Here I provide an overview of how nucleic acids with interesting and useful properties can be identified and optimized using artificial evolution. I also describe motifs that push the limits of DNA and RNA function in various ways. These examples highlight the remarkable functional potential of nucleic acids.







Abstract
For many decades it was thought that information storage and information transfer were the main functions of nucleic acids. However, artificial evolution experiments have shown that the functional potential of DNA and RNA is much greater. Here I provide an overview of this technique and highlight recent advances which have increased its potency. I also describe how artificial evolution has been used to identify nucleic acids with extreme functions. These include deoxyribozymes that generate unusual products such as light, tiny motifs made up of fewer than ten nucleotides, ribozymes that catalyze complex reactions such as RNA polymerization, information&#8208;rich sequences that encode overlapping ribozymes, motifs that catalyze reactions at rates too fast to be followed by manual pipetting, and functional nucleic acids which are active in extreme conditions. Such motifs highlight the limits of our knowledge and provide clues about as of yet undiscovered functions of DNA and RNA.

         <title>Fused Bis(hemi&#8208;indigo): Broad&#8208;Range Wavelength&#8208;Independent Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis(hemi&#8208;indigo) derivatives are introduced as unique photoswitches with wavelength&#8208;independent isomeric ratios in photostationary states. The wavelength&#8208;independent photoswitching, high bistability and significant overlap between the photoswitch absorption and the solar spectrum make bis(hemi&#8208;indigo) derivatives interesting candidates for MOST applications.







Abstract
Wavelength&#8208;independent conversion of organic photoswitches in the photostationary state is a rare phenomenon that opens up a way for many practical applications. In this work, three fused bis(hemi&#8208;indigo) derivatives with different substitution patterns were synthesized and their photoswitching was investigated by optical spectroscopy, real&#8208;time NMR spectroscopy and TD&#8208;DFT calculations. We disclosed that the Z&#8208;E photoisomerization of the meta&#8208;bis(hemi&#8208;indigo) derivative was remarkably independent of the irradiation wavelength from UV up to yellow light. The wavelength&#8208;independent forward photoswitching together with the inhibited backward photoisomerization, high thermal stability of the photoinduced isomers as well as significant overlap between the photoswitch absorption and the solar spectrum allows to suggest bis(hemi&#8208;indigo) derivatives as promising candidates for molecular solar thermal energy storage (MOST) systems.

&lt;p&gt;Wavelength-independent conversion of organic photoswitches in the photostationary state is a rare phenomenon that opens up a way for many practical applications. In this work, three fused bis(hemi-indigo) derivatives with different substitution patterns were synthesized and their photoswitching was investigated by optical spectroscopy, real-time NMR spectroscopy and TD-DFT calculations. We disclosed that the &lt;i&gt;Z-E&lt;/i&gt; photoisomerization of the &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;-bis(hemi-indigo) derivative was remarkably independent of the irradiation wavelength from UV up to yellow light. The wavelength-independent forward photoswitching together with the inhibited backward photoisomerization, high thermal stability of the photoinduced isomers as well as significant overlap between the photoswitch absorption and the solar spectrum allows to suggest bis(hemi-indigo) derivatives as promising candidates for molecular solar thermal energy storage (MOST) systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Labile Base&#8208;Stabilized Silyliumylidene Ions. Non&#8208;Metallic Species Capable of Activating Multiple Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various base&#8208;stabilized silyliumylidene ions with different ligands were synthesized. Their behaviour appeared strongly dependent on the type of ligand. Indeed, in contrast to the poorly reactive silyliumylidenes stabilized by strongly donating ligands (DMAP, NHC), the sulfide&#8208;supported one (SMe2) exhibits higher reactivity toward various small molecules. Furthermore, their capability to successively activate multiple small molecules was clearly demonstrated by processes involving successive reactions with silane/formamide, CO2 and H2. Of particular interest, the silyliumylidene&#8208;silylene complex is one of the rare species able to activate two H2 molecules.







Abstract
Several base&#8208;stabilized silyliumylidene ions (2 and 3) with different ligands were synthesized. Their behaviour appeared strongly dependent on the nature of ligand. Indeed, in contrast to the poorly reactive silyliumylidene ions 3&#8201;c,d stabilized by strongly donating ligands (DMAP, NHC), the silylene&#8208; and sulfide&#8208;supported one (2&#8208;H and 3&#8201;a) exhibits higher reactivity toward various small molecules. Furthermore, their capability to successively activate multiple small molecules was clearly demonstrated by processes involving successive reactions with silane/formamide, CO2 and H2. Moreover, HBPin adduct of 3&#8201;a (8&#8208;C) catalyzes the hydroboration of pyridine. Of particular interest, silylene&#8208;supported silyliumylidene complex 2&#8208;H is one of the rare species able to activate two H2 molecules.

         <title>A Piezo&#8208;Fenton System with Rapid Iron Cycling and Hydrogen Peroxide Self&#8208;Supply Driven by Ultrasound</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;Fe was synthesized with varied Fe amount to construct a piezo&#8208;Fenton system driven by ultrasound, achieving the coupling of piezoelectric processes and Fenton reactions without exogenous hydrogen peroxide. Electrons generated in the piezoelectric process takes part in hydrogen peroxide production and accelerate the Fe2+/Fe3+ cycle. The piezo&#8208;Fenton system exhibited excellent and stable hydroxyl radical generating capacity in pH&#8197;2&#8211;9 without iron leaking, and the hydroxyl radicals mainly contributed to the degradation of MB and the sterilization process.







Abstract
The piezo&#8208;Fenton system has attracted attention not only because it can enhance the Fenton reaction activity by mechanical energy input, but also because it is expected to realize a class of stimuli&#8208;responsive advanced oxidation systems by regulating energy input and hydrogen peroxide self&#8208;supply, thus greatly enriching the application possibilities of Fenton chemistry. In this work, a series of Fe&#8208;doped g&#8208;C3N4 (g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;Fe) as a piezo&#8208;Fenton system were synthesized where the iron stably immobilized through Fe&#8722;N interaction. The piezo&#8208;induced electrons generate on g&#8208;C3N4 matrix support the conversion of Fe(III) to Fe(II) and promote rate&#8208;limiting step of Fenton reaction. With the optimal Fe loading, g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;0.5Fe can achieve methylene blue (MB) degradation under ultrasonic treatment with first&#8208;order kinetic rate constants of 75&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;min&#8722;1. Most importantly, the g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;Fe can maintain good catalytic activity in a wide pH range (pH=2.0&#8764;9.0) and be cyclic used without iron leaching to solution (&lt;0.001&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1), overcoming the disadvantage of traditional Fe&#8208;based Fenton catalysts that can only be applied under acidic conditions and prone to secondary pollution. In addition, g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;0.5Fe also exhibits antibacterial properties of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus under ultrasound. Hydroxyl radicals mainly contribute to the degradation of MB and the sterilization process. Our work is an attempt to clarify the role of g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;Fe in the conversion of mechanical energy to ROS and provide inspirations for the piezo&#8208;Fenton system design.

         <title>Binding of Glycans to the SARS CoV&#8208;2 Spike Protein, an Open Question: NMR Data on Binding Site Localization, Affinity, and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sweet, but not so sweet. The SARS CoV&#8208;2 spike glycoprotein engages in weak interactions with sialoglycans, but binding to ABO(H) blood group antigens cannot be confirmed by STD NMR experiments. Chemical shift perturbation experiments show that none of the glycans interacts with the receptor binding domain of the spike glycoprotein.







Abstract
We have used NMR experiments to explore the binding of selected glycans and glycomimetics to the SARS CoV&#8208;2 spike glycoprotein (S&#8208;protein) and to its receptor binding domain (RBD). STD NMR experiments confirm the binding of sialoglycans to the S&#8208;protein of the prototypic Wuhan strain virus and yield dissociation constants in the millimolar range. The absence of STD effects for sialoglycans in the presence of the Omicron/BA.1 S&#8208;protein reflects a loss of binding as a result of S&#8208;protein evolution. Likewise, no STD effects are observed for the deletion mutant &#916;143&#8211;145 of the Wuhan S&#8208;protein, thus supporting localization of the binding site in the N&#8208;terminal domain (NTD). The glycomimetics Oseltamivir and Zanamivir bind weakly to the S&#8208;protein of both virus strains. Binding of blood group antigens to the Wuhan S&#8208;protein cannot be confirmed by STD NMR. Using 1H,15N TROSY HSQC&#8208;based chemical shift perturbation (CSP) experiments, we excluded binding of any of the ligands studied to the RBD of the Wuhan S&#8208;protein. Our results put reported data on glycan binding into perspective and shed new light on the potential role of glycan&#8208;binding to the S&#8208;protein.

A single pentagon defect in a single&#8208;layered graphene catalyst is emphasized next to a control structure (pentagon ring passivated by oxygen). The small molecules near the defect represent the reactant and intermediate product of the oxygen reduction reaction. Lightning around the graphene indicates how the pentagon defect was fabricated with electro&#8208;assistance and the oxygen reduction reaction was driven by electrical energy. More information on identifying the catalyst's precise active site can be found in the Research Article by F. Qiu, L. Zhang, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202700).

Specific lipid interaction in complex membranes: Specific interactions with lipids are critical for proteins and drugs, however, direct structural measurements of interactions with lipids remain difficult, especially in membranes that mimic biological conditions. Here, a broadly applicable solid&#8208;state NMR approach is presented that enables to directly measure specific interactions with lipids such as cardiolipin in complex fluid membranes.







Abstract
Specific interactions with phospholipids are often critical for the function of proteins or drugs, but studying these interactions at high resolution remains difficult, especially in complex membranes that mimic biological conditions. In principle, molecular interactions with phospholipids could be directly probed by solid&#8208;state NMR (ssNMR). However, due to the challenge to detect specific lipids in mixed liposomes and limited spectral sensitivity, ssNMR studies of specific lipids in complex membranes are scarce. Here, by using purified biological 13C,15N&#8208;labeled phospholipids, we show that we can selectively detect traces of specific lipids in complex membranes. In combination with 1H&#8208;detected ssNMR, we show that our approach provides unprecedented high&#8208;resolution insights into the mechanisms of drugs that target specific lipids. This broadly applicable approach opens new opportunities for the molecular characterization of specific lipid interactions with proteins or drugs in complex fluid membranes.

         <title>N&#8208;Acenoacenes: Synthesis and Solid&#8208;State Properties</title>

Enabling semiconducting properties in N&#8208;acenoacenes. Reducing the steric demand of N&#8208;acenoacenes tunes the solid&#8208;state packings of N&#8208;acenoacenes in favor of &#960;&#8211;&#960;&#8208;stacking, allowing charge transfer through the crystal lattice. The first utilization of N&#8208;acenoacenes in p&#8208;type organic thin&#8208;film transistors is reported.







Abstract
Four N&#8208;acenoacenes were synthesized and analyzed for their optoelectronic properties and solid&#8208;state packings. Two of the regioisomeric acridinoacridines are TIPS&#8208;ethynylated, whereas the other pair are Boc&#8208; and triflate substituted derivatives. The two TIPS&#8208;ethynyldiazaacenoacenes were processed into organic thin&#8208;film transistors with saturation hole mobilities reaching 2.9&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;cm2(Vs)&#8722;1.
