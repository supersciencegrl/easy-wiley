         <title>Turning Color Confusion to Clarity: A Layered Ce&#8722;Based Nanozyme Drives Rapid Wavelength Transition for Discriminative Detection of Nerve Agent during Decontamination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We show a Ce&#8722;BTB&#8722;MOL nanozyme, featuring abundant unsaturated active sites, capable of smartly erasing the persisting issue of color confusion generated from the hydrolyzed product during the detection of OP nerve agents decontamination. The nanozyme paper strips drive unique wavelength transition&#8208;based discriminative detection of a nerve agent with high confidence and selectivity.








ABSTRACT
Organophosphate (OP)&#8208;based nerve agents (NAs) pose serious risks to human life, demanding materials that facilitate rapid decontamination and reliable detection with selectivity. Ce&#8208;based metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are considered as promising candidates due to their high reactivity. However, their intrinsic yellow color misleads detection of NAs such as paraoxon, which releases yellow p&#8208;nitrophenol. Here, we report a bioinspired 2D metal&#8208;organic layer (MOL) construct, Ce&#8722;BTB&#8722;MOL, a phosphotriesterase nanozyme with abundant binding sites that not only facilitate rapid degradation of paraoxon (t1/2 = 6&#160;min), but quick detection by a smart mechanism. This nanozyme seamlessly arrests product with its binding to Ce clusters and triggering wavelength transition that overcomes color confusion, enabling quick and confident detection within 13 s on paper strips. Mechanistic studies reveal that p&#8208;nitrophenol binding to Ce clusters induces ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT), producing an intense orange&#8208;brown signal. Based on the wavelength transition response, this nanozyme also showcases selective discrimination of structurally similar OPs, a challenge for conventional systems. Ce&#8722;BTB&#8722;MOL achieves real&#8208;time, affordable, portable, easy, and rapid sensing without the requirement of sophisticated equipment, with a detection limit as low as 1.24&#160;&#181;g, quantifiable by smartphone RGB analysis. Importantly, the nanozyme demonstrates high selectivity against several interferents, allowing precise surface contamination analysis.

         <title>Accelerating the Discovery of Targeted Protein Degraders: Advances in Synthetic Methodologies and Screening Tactics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From CuAAC and SuFEx to late&#8208;stage functionalization, this review summarizes synthetic advances tailored for protein degraders. Importantly, we elucidate how integrating these chemical toolkits with advanced biological assays and automation workflows maximizes candidate identification efficiency and propels a new era of high&#8208;throughput targted protein degrader discovery.








ABSTRACT
Targeted protein degradation (TPD) is significantly expanding the druggable landscape to include proteins that are intractable to conventional occupancy&#8208;based inhibition. However, the discovery of targeted protein degraders is often less efficient due to their structural complexity and the labor&#8208;intensive nature of traditional medicinal chemistry campaigns. To capture the recent advances developed to streamline and accelerate degrader discovery, this review summarizes enabling synthetic methodologies and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art screening strategies specialized for this field. From the well&#8208;established click chemistry to emerging late&#8208;stage functionalization, we highlight a wide array of robust and versatile chemistries that facilitate the rapid construction of diverse degrader libraries. Moreover, we elucidate how these synthetic toolkits synergize with screening tactics to expand the biological space and maximize the efficiency of identifying promising degrader candidates. Furthermore, we underscore that evolving automation and robotic workflows are integrating with these synthetic and screening strategies to propel a new era of degrader discovery. By providing a comprehensive overview and critical perspectives on these advancements, this review aims to offer a practical roadmap for researchers to streamline degrader synthesis and strategically screen their libraries, with the hope of inspiring continued innovation to expedite the discovery of novel degraders with both biological and therapeutic importance.

         <title>Addition Reactions of Phosphorus&#8208;Centered Radicals onto Olefins: Interplay Between Stability and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The energetics of the addition reaction of P&#8208;centered radicals onto alkenes are primarily ruled by the stability of the attacking radical, as outlined by the computational screening of a wide range of reactions. In addition, donor&#8208;acceptor substituents at the olefin have an important tuning role.








ABSTRACT
Phosphorus&#8208;centered radicals are important intermediates in various chemical transformations, enabling wide&#8208;ranging applications. Among these, the addition of radicals onto the carbon centers of olefins is the common key step in two distinct synthetic approaches: the P&#8208;H addition reactions catalyzed by radical additives, as well as the radical&#8208;induced polymerization. To gain a comprehensive understanding of reactivity trends, we explored computationally how the chemical nature of radicals affects the thermodynamics and kinetics of their reaction toward the parent ethylene and a set of variously substituted olefins. As a result, the fundamental differences between the main types of phosphinyl and phosphonyl radicals have been clarified. In general, the reaction energies of additions correlate with the radical stabilization energies obtained for the attacking radical: Less stable radicals lead to more exothermic reactions, and their reactions are also characterized by lower activation barriers. Consequently, the relative reactivity of a P&#8208;centered radical, in terms of both kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of the addition, can be well predicted using the easily accessible radical stabilization energies prior to experiments. The predictive value of this methodology was verified using explicitly calculated energies on a set of radicals suitable for experimental investigations.

         <title>Construction of CuO/Co3O4 Heterojunction Catalyst for High&#8208;Efficiency Ammonia Synthesis via Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of CuO/Co3O4 heterojunction catalyst was applied to effectively regulate the hydrogenation of nitrate to yield ammonia by optimizing the activation process and reaction barrier.








ABSTRACT
Electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) offers a sustainable approach to convert nitrate pollutants into ammonia (NH3). However, challenges such as low NH3 yield, competition from the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and limited nitrate adsorption restrict its efficiency. Here, we developed CuO/Co3O4 heterojunction catalysts with strong interfacial coupling that synergistically modulate the electronic structure to promote efficient electron transfer. This enhances nitrate adsorption and activation while suppressing HER by accelerating active hydrogen species formation. The catalyst demonstrated a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 94.58%, accompanied by an NH3 production rate of 2306.44&#160;&#181;mol&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;mg&#8722;1. Notably, it exhibited exceptional durability.

         <title>Strong Implications From Small Deviations in Labeling Patterns: The Mechanism of Burkholderia gladioli Pacifigorgiadiene Synthase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of pacifigorgiadiene synthase from Burkholderia gladioli was investigated through isotopic labeling experiments and DFT calculations. The results revealed an unexpected labeling pattern which appeared to be different in the main and the side products, requiring unprecedented mechanistic explanations, including a &#8220;break&#8208;flip&#8208;cyclise&#8221; sequence to set the correct stereochemistry.








ABSTRACT
The sesquiterpene synthase BgPgS from Burkholderia gladioli produces the main product (&#8211;)&#8208;1&#8208;epi&#8208;pacifigorgia&#8208;6,10&#8208;diene, besides a few structurally related compounds. The enzyme mechanism of BgPgS was addressed through isotopic labeling experiments, revealing several intricate mechanistic problems. Unexpectedly, the isotopic labelings for the Me groups C12 and C13 occurred in different positions for the main and the side products. Moreover, as demonstrated in this study, two hydrogen atoms must change from the bottom to the top hemisphere, which is not possible through standard terpene biosynthesis routines with suprafacial hydrogen migrations. Our rational solution involves two mechanistic explanations: First, a key rearrangement may be associated with a conformational change that rotates one hydrogen from bottom to top. Second, a &#8220;break&#8208;flip&#8208;cyclize&#8221; sequence explains the change of side by the other hydrogen. DFT calculations show that the proposed terpene cyclization cascades are energetically feasible; only one problematic activation barrier (&gt;25&#160;kcal/mol) remains. However, several mechanistic alternatives either failed to explain the experimental results of the isotopic labeling experiments or were associated with even higher activation barriers. Our biosynthetic proposal for pacifigorgiadiene biosynthesis can be understood as a contribution that awaits further investigation and scientific debate for its ultimate resolution.

The results revealed an unexpected labeling pattern which appeared to be different in the main and the side products, requiring unprecedented mechanistic explanations, including a &#8220;break-flip-cyclise&#8221; sequence to set the correct stereochemistry.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sesquiterpene synthase BgPgS from &lt;i&gt;Burkholderia gladioli&lt;/i&gt; produces the main product (&#8211;)-1-&lt;i&gt;epi&lt;/i&gt;-pacifigorgia-6,10-diene, besides a few structurally related compounds. The enzyme mechanism of BgPgS was addressed through isotopic labeling experiments, revealing several intricate mechanistic problems. Unexpectedly, the isotopic labelings for the Me groups C12 and C13 occurred in different positions for the main and the side products. Moreover, as demonstrated in this study, two hydrogen atoms must change from the bottom to the top hemisphere, which is not possible through standard terpene biosynthesis routines with suprafacial hydrogen migrations. Our rational solution involves two mechanistic explanations: First, a key rearrangement may be associated with a conformational change that rotates one hydrogen from bottom to top. Second, a &#8220;break-flip-cyclize&#8221; sequence explains the change of side by the other hydrogen. DFT calculations show that the proposed terpene cyclization cascades are energetically feasible; only one problematic activation barrier (&amp;gt;25&#160;kcal/mol) remains. However, several mechanistic alternatives either failed to explain the experimental results of the isotopic labeling experiments or were associated with even higher activation barriers. Our biosynthetic proposal for pacifigorgiadiene biosynthesis can be understood as a contribution that awaits further investigation and scientific debate for its ultimate resolution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed C&#9472;C Bond Borylation of Biphenylenes Leading to Tri&#8208;Ortho&#8208;Substituted Biaryls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening C&#9472;C borylation of 1&#8208;substituted biphenylenes yields a range of o,o,o&#8242;&#8208;trisubstituted biaryls with two ortho&#8208;boryl groups via selective cleavage of the least hindered C&#9472;C bond. The resulting diborylated products are readily amenable to sequential, site&#8208;selective postfunctionalization.








ABSTRACT
Ring&#8208;opening diborylation of carbon&#9472;carbon (C&#9472;C) single bonds is a powerful strategy for installing two versatile functional groups at nonadjacent carbon atoms, enabling skeletal editing of strained ring systems. However, such transformations remain rare for rings larger than cyclopropanes due to kinetic and thermodynamic challenges. Herein, we describe a palladium&#8208;catalyzed diborylation of 1&#8208;substituted biphenylenes enabled by a highly electron&#8208;rich and sterically demanding N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand. The reaction proceeds via selective cleavage of the least sterically hindered C&#9472;C bond and affords ortho&#8208;diborylated biphenyls in 39%&#8211;89% isolated yields across a broad range of 1&#8208;substituted biphenylenes with diverse steric and electronic properties. High regioselectivities (up to &gt;20:1) are observed for cleavage of the least sterically hindered C&#9472;C bond. Regioselectivity is modulated by both electronic and steric effects: electron&#8208;donating aryl substituents enhance selectivity, as indicated by a Hammett correlation, whereas spherical substituents favour higher selectivity than planar aryl groups. Supporting stoichiometric experiments indicate a pathway involving initial C&#9472;C bond activation. The resulting sterically hindered tri&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted biaryls may serve as valuable synthetic intermediates, as demonstrated by selective sequential orthogonal postfunctionalization of a representative example.

         <title>Asynchronous Reaction Toward Hierarchical Crosslinking Polymer Networks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 6, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical crosslinking network structures through asynchronous reactions based on the difference in reactivity of functional groups enable the realization of topologically customizable polyurea ionogels. This Concept explores the impact of network structure on the mechanical properties, hysteresis, and multifunctionality of polymer ionogels, offering a pathway for advanced flexible iontronic applications.








ABSTRACT
Ionogels have emerged as promising materials in soft iontronics, with their network structure playing a pivotal role in determining performance and enabling diverse applications. Refining the network architectures of ionogels through chemical design is a promising strategy. This Concept article summarizes our recent progress in the design of polymeric ionogel networks. Our methodology exploits the pronounced disparity in chemical reactivity among functional groups, thereby achieving the spontaneous formation of these hyperbranched clusters through asynchronous reactions. These hyperbranched clusters spontaneously assemble via hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions, thereby constructing hierarchical cross&#8208;linked polymer networks. This network design endows polyurea ionogels with high strength, exceptional toughness, low hysteresis, and fluorescence. We have summarized the applications of such ionogels in emerging fields, including flexible sensing, electroluminescent devices, and nanogenerators. Finally, the application prospects and future development directions of these materials are discussed. This network design strategy is expected to provide new insights for developing functionalized ionogels.

         <title>Construction of Phospholipid&#8208;Like Vesicles by Aqueous Aminolysis of Acyl Thioesters With Diamino Acids</title>

         <dc:description>
Membrane&#8208;forming phospholipids are produced in cells via enzymatic diacylation. Here, we show that direct aminolysis of acyl thioesters with diamino acids in aqueous environments enables the synthesis of diacylated amino acids (DAAAs), which spontaneously self&#8208;assemble into robust phospholipid&#8208;like vesicles across a broad range of pH and temperature.








ABSTRACT
Membrane&#8208;forming phospholipids are produced in cells by enzymatic diacylation of polar head groups. However, analogous nonenzymatic processes remain both challenging and limited in scope. Moreover, the restricted variety of canonical lipid head groups constrains the properties and functions of phospholipid membranes. Therefore, the development of chemical methodologies for the straightforward preparation of versatile membrane&#8208;forming building blocks is highly valuable. Here, we describe a simple strategy for the aqueous synthesis of phospholipid&#8208;like molecules via direct aminolysis between diamino acids and water&#8208;soluble acyl thioesters. In the presence of imidazole, diamino acids (i.e., diaminopropionic acid, ornithine, lysine) undergo rapid N&#8208;diacylation to yield amphiphilic diacylated amino acids (DAAAs). These amino acid&#8208;lipid conjugates spontaneously self&#8208;assemble into robust micron&#8208;sized vesicular structures capable of encapsulating hydrophilic cargos across a wide pH and temperature range. Our findings highlight the potential of amino acid&#8208;based lipids as modular, functional building blocks for generating tunable membranous systems in aqueous environments.

         <title>Cyclodextrin&#8208;Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Based on Formate Decomposition With Bio/Metal Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 6, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen evolution from formate with a hybrid system of enzyme, donor&#8208;acceptor linked photocatalyst&#8208;cyclodextrin complex (Mes&#8208;Acr+&#8208;CD) and platinum nanoparticle is reported. The use of CD as a dispersant for Mes&#8208;Acr+ is a perfect strategy to enhance photocatalytic activity in aqueous solution without deactivation of the enzyme. This work also reveals that ring size and substituents of CD could influence hydrogen production in the system significantly.








ABSTRACT
Formic acid is an attractive hydrogen carrier in terms of hydrogen capacity and safety. Focusing on hydrogen release from formic acid, the developments of catalysts with easy controllability in mild conditions have been desirable. Previous study reported a hybrid catalytic system of enzymes, photosensitizers, and metal nanoparticles for controllable hydrogen production with visible light. However, methyl viologen, which is a toxic compound, was utilized as an electron mediator from photosensitizers to metal nanoparticles. 9&#8208;Mesityl&#8208;10&#8208;methyl acridinium (Mes&#8208;Acr+) is one of the promising candidates which hold a long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated state for the removal of methyl viologen from the hybrid system to enhance the safety and the catalytic activity.

&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen evolution from formate with a hybrid system of enzyme, donor-acceptor linked photocatalyst-cyclodextrin complex (Mes-Acr&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-CD) and platinum nanoparticle is reported. The use of CD as a dispersant for Mes-Acr&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is a perfect strategy to enhance photocatalytic activity in aqueous solution without deactivation of the enzyme. This work also reveals that ring size and substituents of CD could influence hydrogen production in the system significantly.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formic acid is an attractive hydrogen carrier in terms of hydrogen capacity and safety. Focusing on hydrogen release from formic acid, the developments of catalysts with easy controllability in mild conditions have been desirable. Previous study reported a hybrid catalytic system of enzymes, photosensitizers, and metal nanoparticles for controllable hydrogen production with visible light. However, methyl viologen, which is a toxic compound, was utilized as an electron mediator from photosensitizers to metal nanoparticles. 9-Mesityl-10-methyl acridinium (Mes-Acr&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) is one of the promising candidates which hold a long-lived charge-separated state for the removal of methyl viologen from the hybrid system to enhance the safety and the catalytic activity. In this work, cyclodextrins (CDs) were employed to form a complex with Mes-Acr&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; using supramolecular interactions such as ionic and hydrophobic interactions, which improved photocatalytic activity in aqueous solution. This supramolecular photocatalyst was finally applied to photocatalytic hydrogen production with a system of formate dehydrogenase, NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Mes-Acr&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, CD, and colloidal platinum nanoparticles dispersed by polyvinylpyrrolidone. An ultimate yield from formate to hydrogen reached 24% at pH 6.0, indicating a rate-determining step would be electron transfer from Mes-Acr radical to Pt-PVP to reduce protons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Development of tCAP(N3): Affinity Peptide&#8208;Aided, pH&#8208;Triggered Strategy for Site&#8208;Specific Native IgG Modification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 6, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tCAP(N3) reagent, featuring a stable and self&#8208;activating precursor, enables site&#8208;specific conjugation of native IgGs. This Fc&#8208;affinity peptide approach selectively transfers an Ac&#8208;Lys(N3)&#8208;Gly&#8208;Gly payload to Lys248, producing divalently azidated antibody while preserving its biological function. The incorporated azide groups serve as handles for efficient click chemistry with DBCO&#8208;functionalized payloads, yielding well&#8208;defined ADCs.








ABSTRACT
Direct modification of native antibodies with affinity peptides remains a significant challenge, primarily because the affinity peptide often stays bound to the antibody and blocks its interaction with key receptors. In this study, we developed tCAP(N3), a novel traceless chemical conjugation method that employs an affinity peptide. tCAP(N3) can be stored for over a year at refrigerated temperature, as it contains an active ester precursor that can be spontaneously activated under neutral conditions. When tCAP(N3) was mixed with a target native IgG, Ac&#8208;Lys(N3)&#8208;Gly&#8208;Gly was site&#8208;selectively transferred onto Lys248, yielding divalently azidated IgG that can be further modified with DBCO compounds. The resulting antibody conjugates retained Fc receptor binding and antigen recognition comparable to the parent IgG.

         <title>Modulating the Optoelectronic Properties of Tripodal Fluorophores Through Fluorine&#8208;Substituted Peripheral Phenyls</title>

C3&#8208;symmetric D&#8208;(&#960;&#8208;D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A)3 fluorophores featuring central triphenylamine donor, polarizable 2,5&#8208;divinylthiophene linker, and a broad portfolio of fluorine&#8208;based substituents show tunable (non)linear optical properties.








ABSTRACT
Fourteen novel tripodal fluorophores based on a central triphenylamine donor, electron&#8208;rich, and polarizable divinylthiophene linker, and eight different fluorine&#8208;based substituents have been designed and prepared via a straightforward four&#8208;step sequence. Altering the peripheral F&#8208;substitution has been demonstrated to largely affect their fundamental properties such as thermal robustness (210&#8211;420 &#176;C), the LUMO energies (ELUMO = &#8722;2.35 to &#8722;3.11&#160;eV), the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap (&#916;E = 2.07&#8211;2.66&#160;eV), and the absorption/emission maxima (&#955;maxA/E = 442&#8211;478/521&#8211;678&#160;nm). The experimental data, corroborated by DFT calculations, further revealed twofold and tunable ICT employing both central triphenylamine and auxiliary thiophene donors, and the peripheral F&#8208;substitution either boosting or switching&#8208;off two&#8208;photon absorption activity. Whereas the &#9472;SF5 groups impart an exceptional cross&#8208;section of 1930 GM, the &#9472;COCF3 group may completely suppress the nonlinear optical response.

         <title>How Do Charge States Affect Ammonia Coordination in Superatomic Niobium Clusters?</title>

This study reveals how cluster charge states regulate ammonia coordination on superatomic niobium clusters, illustrating a superatom&#8208;&#963; coordination mechanism.








ABSTRACT
Atomically precise metal clusters have garnered significant research attention owing to their distinctive properties, which make them promising for advanced materials and catalytic applications. A fundamental understanding of metal cluster&#8208;ligand interactions is crucial for developing efficient cluster&#8208;based catalysts and functional materials. In this study, we show that Nbn+ and Nbn&#8722; clusters exhibit charge&#8208;dependent reactivity with NH3, resulting in prominent coordination products including Nb7(NH3)7+, Nb7(NH3)2&#8722;, Nb8(NH3)8+, and Nb8(NH3)4&#8722;. Using DFT calculations, we uncovered the critical role of cluster charge states and Lewis&#8208;acid sites in determining reactivity and the formation of complex products. Furthermore, we elucidated the superatom&#8208;&#963; coordination mode and the stability mechanism of these complexes. This study offers new insights into coordination chemistry and provides a foundation for rational design of new materials via metal cluster complexes.

         <title>Evolved DNAzymes and Stable Activation Chemistry Enable High&#8208;Efficiency DNA Ligation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 6, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
In vitro selection of pre&#8208;structured DNA libraries and chemical screening of alternative activation groups yielded trans&#8208;acting DNAzymes with faster ligation rates and enhanced DNA substrate stability. The combination of C3S1 DNAzymes and phosphobenzimidazole&#8208;activated DNA substrates provides improved DNA ligation performance, offering promise for applications such as DNA data storage.








ABSTRACT
DNA ligation is a fundamental reaction used in a variety of applications, typically performed by T4 DNA ligase. For certain applications, such as DNA data storage, DNA&#8208;ligating DNAzymes offer a more stable and cost&#8208;effective alternative to protein enzymes. The E47 DNAzyme is among the most efficient DNA&#8208;ligating DNAzymes reported, but it still lacks sufficient activity for widespread adoption and requires a highly unstable phosphoimidazole&#8208;activated DNA substrate to function. In this study, we performed in vitro selection using a pre&#8208;structured library based on E47 and identified sequences with more than a twofold increase in ligation activity, representing the fastest DNA&#8208;ligating DNAzymes reported to date. We also screened alternative imidazolide compounds for substrate activation and found that phosphobenzimidazole&#8208;activated DNA substrates are significantly more stable, remaining intact for at least 24 h at room temperature. These advances improve the practicality of DNAzymes for ligation&#8208;based applications and broaden their potential use in DNA data storage.

         <title>Systematic Comparison of Homogeneous Catalyst Recycling Strategies: Organic Solvent Nanofiltration vs. Liquid&#8208;Liquid&#8208;Multiphase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 6, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Key performance metrics, including hexene conversion rates and catalyst leaching, were evaluated over extended continuous operation periods. Results demonstrated that the OSN method significantly outperformed the multiphasic system, maintaining hexene conversion at 83% after 76 h compared to a decline to 72% in the multiphasic setup after 36 h. Furthermore, catalyst leaching was substantially lower in the OSN system, at below 0.1&#160;ppm during continuous operation an order of magnitude less than the competing multiphasic approach.








ABSTRACT
This study presents a systematic comparison of two recycling strategies for molecular catalyst&#8212;multiphasic catalyst recycling and organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN)&#8212;within a unified reaction system. Molecular catalyzed reactions are vital in chemical production, necessitating efficient recycling of costly catalyst metals. To facilitate a fair comparison, a versatile model reaction system was developed that allows for both monophasic and multiphasic configurations while preserving the integrity of the central hydroformylation process, converting 1&#8208;hexene and CO/H2 syngas to heptanal in both cases.

         <title>Hierarchical Manganese&#8208;Doped ZIFs Heterostructure Electrocatalysts for Highly&#8208;Efficient Methanol Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 6, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Mn&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;67/ZIF&#8208;L heterostructure undergoes in situ electrochemical reconstruction into a highly active (Co, Mn)OOH phase, providing abundant catalytic sites and fast charge transfer. The reconstructed catalyst enables efficient methanol oxidation with superior durability while simultaneously achieving energy&#8208;saving hydrogen co&#8208;production.








ABSTRACT
The development of cost&#8208;effective and high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) is essential to promote the hydrogen energy technology. However, most of the electrocatalysts currently used for MOR have drawbacks, such as inefficient reaction kinetics, low tolerance to carbon monoxide poisoning, and unstable performance. Herein, we report a novel hierarchical MOF heterostructure that is made up of Mn&#8208;doped ZIF67 and Mn&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;L (Mn&#8208;ZIF67/L) directly grown on carbon cloth to highly enhance the MOR performance. Such heterostructure integrates flake&#8208;like Mn&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;L with Mn&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;67 nanocrystals, forming a porous core&#8208;shell framework with abundant active sites and enhanced charge transportation. More interesting, the Mn&#8208;ZIF67/L experiences dynamic reconstruction (Mn&#8208;ZIF67/L&#8208;ac) that partial phases in CoMn LDHs are transformed into (Co,Mn)OOH during the electrochemical operation in which further boosting the catalytic performance and stability. The electrochemical results demonstrate that Mn&#8208;ZIF67/L&#8208;ac remarkably improves the MOR performance with the much lower potential of 1.359&#160;V at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, outperforming commercial RuO2. The electrocatalyst also delivers the high MOR stability of &#8764;97% retention after 130&#160;h. This work demonstrates a robust strategy for nonnoble&#8208;metal electrocatalysts and an efficient route to hydrogen production through MOR&#8208;HER coupling.

         <title>Controlled Generation of &#946;&#8208;NiOOH by Sulfuric Acid Treatment Enables Active and Durable Oxygen Evolution Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 6, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conceptual illustration of surface activation and reversible regeneration in H2SO4&#8208;treated Ni foam. Sulfuric&#8208;acid treatment introduces surface &#946;&#8208;NiOOH active sites while embedding a subsurface &#946;/&#947;&#8208;NiOOH reservoir. During electrochemical cycling, this buried phase acts as a structural memory that enables reversible reconstruction of the active &#946;&#8208;NiOOH layer, ensuring sustained oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and durability.








ABSTRACT
Designing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts that can reversibly operate as both oxidation and reduction electrodes is key to developing efficient and rechargeable electrochemical energy systems. However, the evolution of nickel active sites between hydroxide and oxyhydroxide phases, and how such transformations can be made reversible under dynamic operating conditions, remains poorly understood. Here, we report a sulfuric&#8208;acid&#8208;induced surface oxidation strategy that enables both the controlled formation and reversible regeneration of &#946;&#8208;NiOOH active sites on free&#8208;standing nickel foam electrodes. Moderate H2SO4 treatment (1&#160;M) produces an optimized electrode (1.0&#8208;Ni) exhibiting superior OER performance, requiring overpotentials (&#951;) of only 218, 348, and 458&#160;mV at 10, 500, and 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. The enhanced activity originates from sulfuric&#8208;acid&#8208;induced modulation of Ni sites, which promotes &#946;&#8208;NiOOH formation as the catalytically active phase while maintaining structural integrity. Moreover, a buried &#946;&#8208;NiOOH&#8208;rich layer serves as a structural&#8208;memory reservoir, allowing reversible reconstruction of surface &#946;&#8208;NiOOH during redox cycling. This reversible behavior enables the same electrode to function as both anode and cathode, relevant to rechargeable zinc&#8211;air battery and other bifunctional electrochemical systems. The dual mechanism acid&#8208;induced active&#8208;site formation and electrochemical regeneration thus provides a scalable strategy for constructing reversible, heteroatom&#8208;free nickel electrodes for sustainable energy conversion.

         <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Au(I)&#8208;Aryl Complexes Through Mild Base&#8208;Assisted Transmetallation of Arylboronic Acids: Scope and Limitations</title>

A synthetic method based on the use of aqueous ammonia&#8208;assisted transmetallation permits access to various [Au(I)(NHC)(Aryl)] complexes using mild reagents, desirable solvents and ambient reaction conditions.








ABSTRACT
A resurgence of research surrounding Au(I)&#8208;Aryl complexes has led to sustainable methods toward their synthesis, as well as to the expansion of their scope and applications in catalysis, biology, and materials chemistry. The availability of mild synthetic methodologies has facilitated the design and development of Au(I)&#8208;Aryl architectures suitable for specific photonic applications, such as Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) and Room Temperature Phosphorescence (RTP) emitters. The development and application of reliable synthetic methods have increased, yet several synthetic aspects remain to be uncovered. Herein, the synthesis of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) Au(I)&#8208;Aryl complexes through mild, base&#8208;assisted transmetallation of arylboronic acids is further explored, targeting Au(I)&#8208;Aryl structures incorporating polyaromatic and triarylborane frameworks, and structural features of relevance to organometallic synthesis, supramolecular chemistry, and luminescence. In addition to the utilization of K2CO3 as the mild, cost&#8208;effective base of choice, we introduce the use of aqueous ammonia as a novel tool that facilitates transmetallation to gold. The purpose of additional exploration is to discover limitations of the synthetic methods, as well as inherent flaws regarding the design of [Au(NHC)(Ar)] (Ar = Aryl) complexes. Previously undiscovered synthetic limitations are disclosed, along with practical alternatives.

         <title>Dearomative Vinylation of Indoles via Multicomponent Photoredox Thiol&#8208;Yne&#8208;Heteroarene Coupling Reaction</title>

ABSTRACT
Dearomative addition reactions of indoles represent a prominent strategy for the synthesis of practically valuable indolines. However, implementing this approach typically requires prefunctionalization of the indole precursor with specific groups (e.g., alkynes, alkenes, or ketones) to facilitate the subsequent cyclization&#8208;dearomatization step. In this work, we report a three&#8208;component, thiol&#8208;yne&#8208;mediated dearomative vinylation of indoles that circumvents the need for preinstalling reactive fragments into the indole scaffold. The developed photoredox&#8208;catalyzed thiol&#8208;yne&#8208;heteroarene reaction employs Boc&#8208;protected indole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylates as effective terminating agents for the radical cascade.

         <title>Anion&#8208;&#960; Interactions in Direct Amination of Core&#8208;Unsubstituted Perylene Monoimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, five different methods for the direct amination of perylene monoimides (PMIs) from the peri&#8208;position were investigated. The resulting 9&#8208;amino PMIs are Near&#8208;IR active dyes. Anion&#8208;induced direct amination proceeds via the formation of the PMI radical anion, and the results shed light on the nat&#252;re of anion&#8208;&#960; interactions between anions and rylene&#8208;imide dyes.








ABSTRACT
The incorporation of amino substituents at the peri&#8208;positions of perylene monoimides (PMIs) produces elusive push&#8208;pull systems with absorption and emission properties in the UV&#8211;vis and Near&#8208;IR regions. We describe a survey of different direct amination methods for the one&#8208;step synthesis of a series of 9&#8208;alkylamino and 9&#8208;arylamino PMIs. The first method tested is direct amination in neat amines and succesfull only for pyrrolidine. The second method uses the PCC/AgNO3 oxidant system, and high yields are obtained with pyrrolidine. The third method employs KMnO4/AgNO3 as a stronger oxidant system. Pyrrolidine and piperidine are favorable amines for this method, and even diamino PMIs can be obtained. The fourth method uses a Cu(II) salt as a catalyst, and cyclic amines afford products in high yields. The final method is the anion&#8208;mediated direct amination and provides the most suitable method for a variety of cyclic, alkyl, and aryl amines to give 9&#8208;alkylamino and 9&#8208;arylamino PMIs in high yields. In this method, TBAF or TBAOH is used as the anion source, and our detailed spectroscopic and synthetic studies reveal that, as a result of single&#8208;electron transfer from the anion, PMIs can generate radical anions and participate in a radical mechanism in amination.

         <title>Graphene&#8208;Oxide&#8208;Mediated Photothermal Ring&#8208;Closing Metathesis: A Gateway for Organelle Imaging Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rapid and high&#8208;yielding ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM) was performed using graphene oxide (GO) as the photothermal agent under 940&#160;nm LED/solar simulator/sunlight. One of the RCM products was further functionalized to synthesize fluorescent probes for imaging endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria, and Golgi apparatus (GA) in colon cancer cells.








ABSTRACT
Photothermal effect using mild light irradiation has emerged as an interesting strategy in modern synthetic chemistry due to its rapid reaction with high selectivity and spatiotemporal control over conventional heating. However, applying photothermal conversion to carry out organic reactions efficiently using carbon nanomaterials remained largely uncharted. To address this, herein, we report for the first time, graphene oxide (GO) as the photothermal agent to perform ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM) under 940&#160;nm NIR LED light, as well as solar simulator and natural sunlight, using Grubbs&#8208;II catalyst to rapidly synthesize dihydro&#8208;pyrroles in high yield with excellent GO recyclability. Theoretical calculation unveiled that this photothermal RCM efficiency originated from the cumulative synergy between substrate&#8208;GO absorption energy, activation barrier, and nonradiative relaxation rate which emerged as the predominant contributor for the overall reaction outcome. The RCM product can be further functionalized through Pd&#8208;catalyzed Heck coupling to forge various fluorophores for efficient imaging of endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria, and Golgi apparatus (GA) in HCT&#8208;116 colon cancer cells. This GO&#8208;mediated photothermal RCM can open a new direction toward synthesizing complex organic molecules with ease and high yield for biomedical applications.

         <title>Recent Developments in Z&#8208;Scheme Systems for Overall Water Splitting: A Focus on (Oxy)Nitride Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
(Oxy)nitrides are promising photocatalysts with excellent visible&#8208;light response. This review systematically examines the material design strategies, charge separation mechanisms, and performance optimization pathways of (oxy)nitride&#8208;based Z&#8208;scheme systems&#8212;including the redox&#8208;mediated ionic Z&#8208;scheme, the solid&#8208;mediator Z&#8208;scheme, and the direct Z&#8208;scheme configurations&#8212;to facilitate the future development of more efficient solar&#8208;driven photocatalytic hydrogen evolution systems.








ABSTRACT
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic water splitting (OWS) has emerged as a promising approach for solar hydrogen production. However, conventional one&#8208;step photoexcitation systems impose stringent thermodynamic constraints on the band structure of photocatalysts, severely limiting the number of materials that can simultaneously exhibit visible&#8208;light absorption and high catalytic efficiency. In contrast, the Z&#8208;scheme overall water splitting substantially mitigates these thermodynamic demands, thereby enabling the utilization of a wider spectrum of visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive semiconductors. Among the semiconductor materials investigated, (oxy)nitrides have attracted significant attention as ideal candidates for Z&#8208;scheme systems, owing to their tunable electronic structures, strong visible&#8208;light absorption, and favorable band edge positions. Nevertheless, issues such as photocorrosion, high defect densities, and sluggish surface reaction kinetics continue to hinder their catalytic performance. This review comprehensively summarizes recent advances in three types of Z&#8208;scheme overall water splitting systems based on (oxy)nitride photocatalysts: redox couple&#8208;based ionic Z&#8208;schemes, solid&#8208;mediator Z&#8208;schemes, and direct Z&#8208;schemes. It focuses on the material design strategies and the structure&#8211;performance relationships of (oxy)nitrides within these distinct Z&#8208;scheme systems. Finally, the challenges and future prospects of (oxy)nitride&#8208;based Z&#8208;scheme overall water splitting systems are discussed, offering insights into the optimization of material synthesis, surface modification, and mechanistic understanding.

         <title>Ultrafast Synthesis of Titanium Suboxide via Magnetic Induction Heating for Enhanced Photodynamic Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MIH of P25 TiO2 for 12 s leads to the formation of a mixed&#8208;phase structure containing titanium suboxides (e.g., Ti4O7 and Ti2O3), leading to enhanced photodynamic activity toward the eradication of waterborne pathogenic bacteria under visible light irradiation. This is due to the photocatalytic reduction of oxygen and eventual formation of hydroxyl radicals.








ABSTRACT
Magn&#233;li&#8208;phase titanium suboxides (TinO2n&#8208;1) have become a focal point of photocatalytic research due to a reduced band gap and enhanced visible light absorption, as compared to traditional TiO2. Herein, P25 TiO2 is converted to mixed&#8208;phase TinO2n&#8208;1 via ultrafast chemical reduction with sodium borohydride using magnetic induction heating (MIH) at controlled currents for 12 s. The obtained samples exhibit an increasing fraction of Ti2O3 with the MIH current, from 26% at 200 A to 69% at 600 A. Among the series, the sample prepared at 600 A shows the best photocatalytic activity for water purification as manifested in the degradation of organic dyes (methylene blue) and removal of waterborne pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli), due to the photocatalytic reduction of oxygen to hydroxyl radicals. Results from this study highlight the unique potential of MIH in the ultrafast reduction of metal oxides into multiphase heterostructures and their application as high&#8208;performance catalysts.

         <title>1D Cobalt&#8208;Cytidine Monophosphate Coordination Polymer Exhibiting Efficient Ultraviolet Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation</title>

ABSTRACT
In pursuit of new ultraviolet (UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) materials, a novel cobalt&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonded coordination complex, [complex (1)], is synthesized via a slow evaporation method. Complex (1) crystallizes in the noncentrosymmetric (NCS) space group P21 and features a distorted octahedral Co(II) coordination environment that extends into a 3D framework. Remarkably, complex (1) exhibits a strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response, approximately 7.4 times greater than that of KH2PO4 (KDP). The pronounced activity arises from robust hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions that suppress antiparallel packing, as well as from the highly distorted, polarizable Co(II) coordination geometry. In addition, complex (1) exhibits an optical bandgap (3.41&#160;eV), indicating UV transparency. These findings make a complex (1) Co(II)&#8208;based framework that can be used in UV NLO applications and emphasize it as an effective synthetic approach to the design of polar metal&#8208;organic systems with improved optical properties.

         <title>Bioinspired Manganese Catalyzed Direct Deamination of Primary Amines With Water Forming Carboxylic Acids and Ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An earth&#8208;abundant manganese&#8208;catalyzed oxidative deamination of linear and branched primary amines to selectively form carboxylic acids and ketones using water as the oxygen atom source is described. The reaction is catalyzed by a bio&#8208;inspired DAFO (4,5&#8208;diazafluoren&#8208;9&#8208;one) ligand&#8208;based [(DAFO)Mn(CO)3Br] complex (Mn&#8208;1) under mildly basic aqueous medium, generating NH3 and H2 as sole by&#8208;products without requiring any oxidant.








ABSTRACT
Herein, we are demonstrating an earth&#8208;abundant manganese&#8208;catalyzed oxidative deamination of linear and branched primary amines to selectively form carboxylic acids and ketones using water as the oxygen atom source. A series of pincer and non&#8208;pincer Mn complexes were assessed for these deaminative transformations. A bio&#8208;inspired DAFO (4,5&#8208;diazafluoren&#8208;9&#8208;one) ligand&#8208;based [(DAFO)Mn(CO)3Br] complex (Mn&#8208;1) was found to be effective for the reaction proceeding under mildly basic aqueous medium, generating NH3 and H2 as sole by&#8208;products without the requirement of any oxidant. An optimized condition of 5&#160;mol% Mn&#8208;1, Na2CO3 (1&#160;equiv) at 150&#176;C for 48&#160;h in water/1,4&#8208;dioxane mixture furnished 92% of the corresponding benzoic acid from benzylamine. A wide variety of electron&#8208;donating and withdrawing para&#8208;, meta&#8208;, and ortho&#8208;substituted benzylamines, including promising hetero and aliphatic linear primary amines, afforded moderate to excellent yield of the desired carboxylate product. We have also examined a few branched primary amines using 5&#160;mol% Mn&#8208;1 and catalytic sodium carbonate at 150&#176;C for 48&#160;h, affording good yield of ketones. The reaction was found to be chemo&#8208;selective for primary amine moieties over alcohol functionalities. Further, stoichiometric mechanistic investigation and preliminary computational data provide insights into the possible mechanistic steps.

         <title>Chain Versus Ring: Characterization of a Meta&#8208;Phenylene Ladder Polymer and Its Octameric Macrocycle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and comprehensive spectral and photophysical analysis of a methyl&#8208;substituted ladder meta&#8208;phenylene macrocycle (MeLMMP) and its polymer analogue (MeLPMP) show that, despite differing topologies (macrocycle vs. polymer), both display nearly identical electronic and photophysical properties due to cross&#8208;conjugation.








ABSTRACT
A methyl&#8208;substituted ladder meta&#8208;phenylene macrocycle (MeLMMP) and its corresponding ladder polymer (MeLPMP), a meta&#8208;analogue of the well&#8208;known ladder&#8208;type poly(para&#8208;phenylene), LPPP, were synthesized and comprehensively investigated. Both compounds exhibit limited conjugation due to the meta&#8208;linked phenylene units, resulting in absorption and emission features shaped by cross&#8208;conjugation. Despite having a longer chain, MeLPMP and MeLMMP exhibit nearly identical electronic and photophysical behavior, suggesting that the number of repeat units has minimal influence. MeLPMP exhibits enhanced vibronic resolution compared to MeLMMP due to a&#160;broadening of the optical bands of the macrocycle caused by the presence of a mixture of stereoisomers formed during the non&#8208;stereoselective ladderization step. A small amount of fluorenone&#8208;type keto defects produces a weak emission near 500&#160;nm, more evident in the macrocycle, and introduces radiationless decay pathways that compete with fluorescence. This decay pathway, together with the weak &#960;,&#960;* conjugation in these angular compounds, lowers the fluorescence quantum yield when compared with the linear MeLPPP, while promoting singlet&#8211;triplet conversion and phosphorescence. The data indicate the presence of three chromophoric populations: pristine oligo(meta&#8208;phenylene) units; units quenched by nearby keto defects; and intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer complexes (ICTCs) formed between oligo(meta&#8208;phenylene) units and keto defects. These findings clarify the photophysics of meta&#8208;phenylene ladder systems, showing that the MeLMMP macrocycle can act as a structural and electronic model for related ladder polymers.

         <title>Unusual Reactivity of a Heterobimetallic Al&#9472;Zn Complex With a Carbodiimide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We show that subtly changing steric bulk about the Al&#9472;Zn bonds of heterobimetallic complexes can switch on reactivity with heteroallenes at the aluminium&#8208;pentamethylcyclopentadienyl moiety as well as the M&#9472;M bond.








ABSTRACT
p&#8208;Block complexes containing unsupported metal&#9472;metal bonds can activate small molecules via mechanisms that complement and contrast with those of d&#8208;block metal complexes. Here we report the synthesis of a new family of heterobimetallic Al&#9472;Zn complexes [(ArNacnac)Zn&#9472;Al(Cp*)(X)] (Ar&#160;=&#160;Dep, X&#160;=&#160;Cl, Br, I; Ar&#160;=&#160;Dipp, X&#160;=&#160;Cl, Br; ArNacnac&#160;=&#160;{HC[C(Me)N(Ar)]2}; Ar&#160;=&#160;Dep, C6H3Et2&#8208;2,6; Dipp, C6H3iPr&#8208;2,6; Cp* = C5Me5), by insertion of in situ&#8208;generated &#8220;AlCp*&#8221; into the Zn&#9472;X bonds of parent dimeric zinc ArNacnac halide complexes [Zn(ArNacnac)(&#956;&#8208;X)]2. We find that the reactions of the newly formed Al&#9472;Zn complexes with N,N&#697;&#8208;dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) proceed by migratory insertion into the Al&#9472;Zn bond to give [Zn(ArNacnac){&#956;2&#8208;C(NCy)2&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;C,&#954;2&#8208;N,N&#697;}Al(Cp*)(X)] (Ar&#160;=&#160;Dep, X&#160;=&#160;Cl, Br, I; Ar&#160;=&#160;Dipp, X&#160;=&#160;Cl, Br) as expected, but for the DippNacnac derivatives a second equivalent of DCC inserts into the Al&#9472;Cp* moiety to afford [Zn(DippNacnac){&#956;2&#8208;C(NCy)2&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;C,&#954;2&#8208;N,N&#697;}Al(Cl){&#954;2&#8208;(NCy)2C&#8208;&#951;1&#8208;Cp*&#8208;&#954;2&#8208;N,N&#697;}] or [Zn(DippNacnac)(Br){&#956;2&#8208;C(NCy)2&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;C,&#954;2&#8208;N,N&#697;}Al{&#954;2&#8208;(NCy)2C&#8208;&#951;1&#8208;Cp*&#8208;&#954;2&#8208;N,N&#697;}], with concomitant halide migration giving a Zn&#9472;Br bond in the latter complex. These results show that non&#8208;innocent reactivity of Al&#9472;Cp*, widely assumed to be a spectator ligand in heterobimetallic complexes, can be switched on by subtly tuning ligand steric bulk about Al&#9472;Zn bonds.

We find that the reactions of the newly formed Al&#9472;Zn complexes with &lt;i&gt;N,N&#697;&lt;/i&gt;-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) proceed by migratory insertion into the Al&#9472;Zn bond to give [Zn(&lt;sup&gt;Ar&lt;/sup&gt;Nacnac){&#956;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-C(NCy)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-&#954;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;,&#954;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#697;}Al(Cp*)(X)] (Ar&#160;=&#160;Dep, X&#160;=&#160;Cl, Br, I; Ar&#160;=&#160;Dipp, X&#160;=&#160;Cl, Br) as expected, but for the &lt;sup&gt;Dipp&lt;/sup&gt;Nacnac derivatives a second equivalent of DCC inserts into the Al&#9472;Cp* moiety to afford [Zn(&lt;sup&gt;Dipp&lt;/sup&gt;Nacnac){&#956;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-C(NCy)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-&#954;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;,&#954;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#697;}Al(Cl){&#954;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-(NCy)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C-&#951;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-Cp*-&#954;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#697;}] or [Zn(&lt;sup&gt;Dipp&lt;/sup&gt;Nacnac)(Br){&#956;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-C(NCy)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-&#954;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;,&#954;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#697;}Al{&#954;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-(NCy)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C-&#951;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-Cp*-&#954;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#697;}], with concomitant halide migration giving a Zn&#9472;Br bond in the latter complex. These results show that non-innocent reactivity of Al&#9472;Cp*, widely assumed to be a spectator ligand in heterobimetallic complexes, can be switched on by subtly tuning ligand steric bulk about Al&#9472;Zn bonds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Two&#8208;Step Synthesis of a Chiral Fluorinated Alcohol With Silica&#8208;Supported Enzyme RrADH in Batch and Continuous Flow Mode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;step process was transferred from batch to flow mode for the synthesis of (R)&#8208;2&#8208;fluoro&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethanol as a benchmark, consisting of a decarboxylative fluorination in aqueous media, followed by an enantioselective biocatalytic reduction of the prochiral intermediate with RrADH immobilized on silica supraparticles. The biocatalyst achieves an excellent enantiomeric excess of &gt;99.9% with an overall yield of 91% for the complete process.








ABSTRACT
The growing demand for sustainable and efficient methods for synthesizing fine chemicals has increased interest in innovative approaches for accessing high&#8208;quality chiral building blocks, particularly fluoroalcohols, which are relevant for the production of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). This study presents the complete integration of a two&#8208;step process in a continuous flow reactor system for the synthesis of (R)&#8208;2&#8208;fluoro&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethanol as a reference molecule. To this end, the individual reaction steps and technologies for the decarboxylative fluorination of 3&#8208;oxo&#8208;3&#8208;phenylpropanoic acid in aqueous media, followed by an enantioselective biocatalytic reduction of the prochiral intermediate phenacyl fluoride, were adapted and implemented in a compact laboratory system for performance demonstration. Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) from Rhodococcus ruber (RrADH) produced in a plant&#8208;derived BY2 cell&#8208;free expression system was used as the biocatalyst, which was immobilized via an imine bond on glutaraldehyde&#8208;modified silica supraparticles. The immobilized enzymes were used in batch mode for comprehensive kinetic studies of the enantioselective reduction, including evaluations of their operational and storage stability. Excellent enantiomeric excess (&gt; 99.9%) and overall yields of up to 91% were achieved for both synthesis steps. These results are a prerequisite for the targeted and stable use of the enzyme in a continuously operated two&#8208;step process, which was achieved by using a serial micro batch reactor (SMBR) setup with a capillary reactor for precise temperature control. This study demonstrates the advantages of combining immobilized biocatalysts with continuous&#8208;flow operation for achieving high efficiency and selectivity in the synthesis of chiral fluoroalcohols. The integrated process provides a sustainable and versatile basis for future developments in the green synthesis of fluorinated building blocks relevant to pharmaceutical applications.

         <title>One&#8208;Step and Universal Strategy for the Synthesis of Hypermodified Uracil Phosphoramidites acp3U and cmnm5U</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;step, highly efficient, and scalable synthesis of acp3U phosphoramidite is described, as well as a new alternative synthesis of cmnm5U phosphoramidite from a highly versatile intermediate. Latter could be scaled&#8208;up, split, and aliquots turned simultaneously into cmnm5U, nm5U, and mnm5U. The synthesis responds to the high demand for hypermodified nucleoside building blocks for the oligonucleotide synthesis.








ABSTRACT
Hypermodified nucleosides have recently been at the center of scientific attention. They represent a unique group of nucleosides with an alternated structure, such as the addition of functional groups or amino acids. Their distinctive structures and positions in RNAs are crucial for the processes of translation and stability. High demand for oligonucleotides bearing those hypermodified nucleobases led us to the development of a single&#8208;step synthesis of acp3U phosphoramidite, as acp3U has been recognized as an important molecule for the structural integrity of tRNA and native immunity. We also present a novel synthesis of cmnm5U phosphoramidite and its incorporation into an oligonucleotide from a highly versatile starting material, allowing a transformation into at least two other hypermodified nucleosides.

         <title>Carbon Dots for Cancer Theranostics: Synthesis Strategies, Luminescence Properties, and Advances in Bioimaging&#8208;Guided Diagnosis and Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lighting up the path to precision oncology: This review comprehensively summarizes the rational design of carbon dots (CDs), elucidating how core size, surface chemistry, and heteroatom doping dictate their luminescence mechanisms. Special emphasis is placed on engineering NIR&#8208;II emissive CDs for deep&#8208;tissue imaging. Furthermore, the review highlights the transformative potential of multifunctional CDs in image&#8208;guided surgery and synergistic cancer theranostics, paving the way for their clinical translation.








ABSTRACT
Carbon dots (CDs) have emerged as a transformative class of luminescent nanomaterials for biomedical applications, offering superior biocompatibility, photostability, and tunability compared to conventional organic dyes and inorganic quantum dots. This review distinguishes itself by establishing a critical &#8220;Structure&#8208;Property&#8208;Application&#8221; feedback framework. We comprehensively summarize the rational design of CDs, specifically elucidating how core size, surface chemistry, and heteroatom doping can be precisely engineered to tailor optical emission into the near&#8208;infrared II window. Furthermore, the versatile roles of CDs in cancer theranostics are critically discussed, encompassing their utility in subcellular tracking, image&#8208;guided surgery, and multifunctional therapeutic platforms such as photothermal therapy (PTT), photodynamic therapy (PDT), and targeted drug delivery. Finally, we address the current challenges regarding scalability, reproducibility, and biosafety, providing a perspective on the future roadmap for the clinical translation of high&#8208;performance CD&#8208;based agents.

         <title>Structure&#8211;Activity Relationship Guided Design of a Highly Sensitive Turn&#8208;on Fluorescent Probe for Imaging Inflammation&#8208;Associated&#8208;HOCl in Early Liver Fibrosis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structure&#8211;activity relationship (SAR) guided donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor probe strategy is developed for hypochlorous acid (HOCl) sensing. Donor&#8208;dependent electronic structures dictate distinct HOCl&#8208;triggered reaction pathways, enabling identification of PMBT as an optimal sensitive turn&#8208;on probe. Mitochondria&#8208;associated HOCl imaging allows precise visualization of inflammation&#8208;related early liver fibrosis in mouse liver tissues.








ABSTRACT
Early&#8208;stage liver fibrosis is potentially reversible, yet its timely diagnosis remains challenging due to the lack of sensitive molecular imaging tools. Hypochlorous acid (HOCl), an inflammation&#8208;associated reactive oxygen species has emerged as a key pathogenic mediator and early biomarker of fibrotic progression. Herein, guided by a structure&#8211;activity relationship (SAR) strategy, three donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A) fluorescent probes (PMBT, CMBT, and TMBT) were rationally designed and systematically evaluated for HOCl detection. Density functional theory calculations (DFT) and spectroscopic studies reveal donor&#8208;dependent electronic distributions and distinct HOCl&#8208;responsive behaviors. Among them, PMBT exhibits a rapid turn&#8208;on response (&lt;10 s), naked&#8208;eye&#8208;detectable fluorescence enhancement, and a low detection limit of 11.38&#160;nM, along with favorable mitochondrial localization. Benefiting from its high sensitivity and liver&#8208;targeting capability, PMBT enables effective imaging of endogenous HOCl and allows precise visualization of early&#8208;stage liver fibrosis in mouse models, highlighting its potential as a powerful diagnostic tool.

Herein, guided by a structure&#8211;activity relationship (SAR) strategy, three donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A) fluorescent probes (&lt;b&gt;PMBT&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;CMBT&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;TMBT&lt;/b&gt;) were rationally designed and systematically evaluated for HOCl detection. Density functional theory calculations (DFT) and spectroscopic studies reveal donor-dependent electronic distributions and distinct HOCl-responsive behaviors. Among them, &lt;b&gt;PMBT&lt;/b&gt; exhibits a rapid turn-on response (&amp;lt;10 s), naked-eye-detectable fluorescence enhancement, and a low detection limit of 11.38&#160;nM, along with favorable mitochondrial localization. Benefiting from its high sensitivity and liver-targeting capability, &lt;b&gt;PMBT&lt;/b&gt; enables effective imaging of endogenous HOCl and allows precise visualization of early-stage liver fibrosis in mouse models, highlighting its potential as a powerful diagnostic tool.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereoselective Access to Trifunctionalized Z&#8208;Allylic Alcohols via Radical&#8208;Mediated 1,4&#8208;Aryl Migration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic, stereoselective synthesis of trifunctionalized Z&#8208;allylic alcohols from readily available benzyl propargyl ethers is disclosed. The reaction proceeds via a radical&#8208;mediated intramolecular 1,4&#8209;aryl migration and oxidative hydrolysis, delivering products with excellent stereoselectivity under mild, photoredox&#8209;neutral conditions.








ABSTRACT
Given the synthetic significance of allylic alcohols, developing efficient methods for their preparation remains a central pursuit in organic chemistry. Herein, we report a stereoselective approach to access trifunctionalized Z&#8209;allylic alcohols via a radical&#8209;mediated 1,4&#8209;aryl migration. By employing readily available benzyl propargyl ethers and Togni&#8208;II reagent as the CF3 source, this reaction proceeds through inert C(sp2)&#8211;C(sp3) bond cleavage, enabling the modular assembly of valuable trifluoromethylated Z&#8209;allylic alcohols under mild, photoredox&#8209;neutral conditions. The protocol exhibits a broad substrate scope, excellent functional&#8209;group tolerance, and high regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selectivity.

         <title>Gold Nanocluster&#8208;Silver Nanoparticle&#8208;MoS2 Heterostructures as SERS&#8208;Active Catalysts With Enhanced Electron&#8208;Donating Capability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of gold nanoclusters into silver nanoparticles&#8208;MoS2 ternary heterostructure enhances the electron&#8208;donating capability of SERS&#8208;active catalytic reaction. By quantifying the electron supply ability using the concept of charge transfer degree, it has been confirmed that silver nanoparticles act as a bridge for charge transfer, helping to transfer the photogenerated charges of gold nanoclusters to MoS2.








ABSTRACT
Metal nanoclusters (MNCs)&#8208;semiconductor (SC) composite materials have garnered significant attention due to the fascinating and versatile properties exhibited by MNCs. However, there is a scarcity of efforts directed toward incorporating metal nanoparticles (MNPs) into MNCs&#8208;SC composites to facilitate charge generation within the system. And the underlying mechanism governing charge transfer in such systems remains elusive. In this work, a straightforward reduction&#8208;adsorption strategy was employed to ingeniously introduce AuNCs into the AgNPs@MoS2 binary nanostructure. This approach effectively improves the electron&#8208;donating performance of resulting AuNCs&#8208;AgNPs@MoS2 ternary heterostructures, which were utilized as the substrates for SERS&#8208;active p&#8208;nitrothiophenol (PNTP)&#8208;catalytic reactions. PNTP&#8208;catalytic experiments further validated the enhanced catalytic performance arising from the introduction of AuNCs into the ternary heterostructure. Furthermore, the composite mechanism of AuNCs and AgNPs in the nanosystem was elucidated, revealing that AgNPs act as charge bridges and synergistically facilitate charge generation in conjunction with AuNCs. The electron&#8208;donating capability was quantified using the concept of charge transfer degree, rendering the impact of AuNCs incorporation on charge yield more intuitive. This study is anticipated to provide a rational approach for the construction of MNCs&#8208;MNPs@SC ternary nanostructures and optimizing the synergistic interaction between MNCs and MNPs, thereby enabling their applications across diverse fields.

         <title>Monomeric Fluorescence of H&#8208;Aggregates in a Series of 2&#8208;(Hydroxyphenyl)benzoxazoles Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of a photochemical channel for the deactivation of excitonic excitation via excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer enables the activation of the forbidden fluorescence from H&#8208;aggregates of 2&#8208;(hydroxyphenyl)benzoxazole derivatives. The fluorescence with an anomalous Stokes shift exhibits high efficiency, with the quantum yield reaching 0.91.








ABSTRACT
The exploitation of molecular self&#8208;assembly, which leads to the formation of aggregates, represents one of the most crucial approaches in the fabrication of advanced functional materials. A fundamental aspect&#160;in this area is the development of novel strategies to construct supramolecular architectures with new (unusual) properties, in particular, strongly fluorescent H&#8208;aggregates. Using 2&#8208;(2&#8208;carboalkoxy&#8208;3,4,5&#8208;trichloro&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)benzoxazoles (HBOs) as building blocks, H&#8208;aggregates were successfully obtained in both aqueous binary mixtures and the crystalline state. These aggregates exhibit intense fluorescence despite the prohibition imposed by Kasha's rule. This violation seems to result from the deactivation mechanism&#160;of the excited excitonic state in HBO H&#8208;aggregates, which involves, along with internal conversion, a photochemical channel induced by excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) rather than a radiative one. The consequence of ESIPT is monomeric fluorescence from the keto forms of HBOs. The fluorescence quantum yields of HBOs in the crystalline state are significantly higher than those in solution, ranging from 0.81 to 0.91. This enhancement is due to intramolecular hydrogen bonds as well as the dense molecular packing of HBOs, which suppresses conformational transformations.

Generalized photochemical pathways for the synthesis of benzene fused 1,4&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;diazines from 1,4&#8208; and 1,5&#8208;aza bis&#8208;nucleophiles and various diazo compounds, utilizing water as the distinct solvent have been materialized. Additionally, &#945;&#8208;diazocarbonyl compounds can act as 1C&#8208;dipolarophiles and generates 1,2,3&#8208;tri substituted indoles when reacted with suitable 1,4&#8208;dipolarophilic coupling partners (2&#8208;aminoacetophenone) following [4+1]&#8208;annulation pathway. The late&#8208;stage modifications of quinoxalinone and quinoxaline scaffold inforcing photoinduced C&#8208;H activation generates the structurally diverse spiroindene compounds, including steroid&#8208;embedded di&#8208;aza heterocycles. Dihydroquinazolines can be transformed to quinazolines applying DDQ as the oxidative dehydrogenating reagent.








ABSTRACT
The development of innovative and sustainable synthetic methodologies is crucial to address the increasing demand for environmentally benign practices in all domains of organic chemistry. In this regard, harnessing visible light as the sole energy input is particularly attractive. Diazo compounds, being highly versatile reagents with notable reactivity and ready accessibility, are well&#8208;suited for photochemical activation, which offers a promising, eco&#8208;friendly alternative to traditional transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed processes. In this perspective, we report generalized photochemical pathways for the synthesis of benzene fused 1,4&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;diazines from 1,4&#8208; and 1,5&#8208;aza bis&#8208;nucleophiles and various diazo compounds, employing water as the sole and distinct solvent under aerobic presence. These protocols involve the direct photoinduced generation of carbenes from diazo compounds, averting the need of any photocatalyst, which then opts [4+2] or [5+1]&#8208;annulation pathway and offers distinct products. The detailed insights into the reaction pathways are investigated through several control experiments and DFT studies. Strategically it is also possible to construct a 5&#8208;membered aza&#8208;heterocyclic core applying the same photochemical approach. Finally, the late&#8208;stage modifications of quinoxalinone and quinoxaline scaffold applying the photoinduced C&#8208;H activation technique generate the structurally diverse spiroindene compounds, including steroid&#8208;embedded di&#8208;aza heterocycle.

         <title>Ammonia Concentration&#8208;Directed Preferential Growth Enhancing Lithium&#8208;Ion Diffusion in Li&#8208;Rich Mn&#8208;Based Oxide Cathodes</title>

ABSTRACT
Ammonia concentration acts as a &#8220;multifunctional structure&#8208;directing factor&#8221; throughout the entire growth of Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based oxide (LRMO) precursors in coprecipitation process. Thus, this study investigates the effect of ammonia concentration on the precursor structure and morphology evolution. It is verified that ammonia concentration can significantly influence the preferential growth of crystallites and the agglomeration behavior of secondary particles. At an optimized ammonia concentration, the Mn0.675Co0.1625Ni0.1625CO3 precursor exhibited preferential growth along the (012) crystallographic plane, facilitating an ordered structural arrangement and suppressing the agglomeration of secondary particle. After lithiation, the resulting LRMO material exhibits an enhanced Li+ diffusion, endowing the material with higher initial capacity, improved rate performance, and superior cycling stability. Furthermore, this work establishes a clear correlation between the lattice parameters of the LRMO material and its Li+ transport and storage properties. These findings offer valuable mechanistic insights and a practical synthesis strategy for enhancing the electrochemical performance of LRMO cathodes by precisely controlling precursor crystallization and microstructure.

Porphyrin arrays go chiral&#8211;A porphyrin Gel&#228;nder macrocycle represents the intriguing prototype architecture of helically chiral butadiyne&#8208;linked porphyrin arrays. This study combines synthetic, spectroscopic, and computational methods to shed light on its structure, chiroptical properties, and tunability, highlighting its promise for advancing functional optoelectronic materials.








ABSTRACT
A new &#8220;Porphyrin&#8208;Gel&#228;nder&#8221; (PoGe) macrocycle rac&#8208;PoGe[Zn, Zn] embodying a twisted butadiyne&#8208;linked porphyrin dyad as the banister was designed and synthesized according to a previously published successful design principle for Gel&#228;nder molecules. The C2&#8208;symmetric properties of rac&#8208;PoGe[Zn, Zn] were revealed by detailed 2D NMR analysis. Postsynthesis modification consisting of central metal ion exchange in the porphyrin moieties led to PoGe macrocycles rac&#8208;PoGe[2H, 2H] and rac&#8208;PoGe[Cu, Cu] and was demonstrated to lead to finely tunable absorption and emission spectra, reaching in the near&#8208;IR region. CSP&#8208;HPLC resolved all rac&#8208;PoGe[M, M] into their (P) and (M) enantiomers, which were analyzed by UV&#8208;Vis, fluorescence and ECD spectroscopy. The absolute configuration was assigned by the exciton chirality method (ECM) and corroborated by comparing experimental and simulated ECD spectra.

         <title>Structural Design of Isomerized Coplanar Ladder Polymers for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two different isomerized coplanar ladder polymers were studied to determine the effect of isomerization on the charge generation and separation process of the photocatalyst in the coplanar structure system, thereby achieving significant photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance.








ABSTRACT
The efficient separation and migration of photogenerated charge carriers remains a major challenge in polymer&#8208;based photocatalysis. Building planar structures through ladder&#8208;type polymers has emerged as an effective strategy to enhance charge carrier dynamics. In this context, we investigate the crucial yet overlooked role of structural isomerization in such systems. Herein, we report two isomeric ladder polymers with coplanar backbones, PAE&#8208;L and PAE&#8208;Z, to systematically investigate the influence of molecular configuration on photocatalytic performance. The optimized PAE&#8208;L exhibits enhanced light&#8208;harvesting capability, strengthened &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, and superior charge transport properties, leading to remarkable photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity. This work provides a reference for the design and performance optimization of efficient coplanar conjugated polymer photocatalysts.

         <title>Mitigated Mn Dissolution and Improved Cycling Stability of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 Spinel Cathodes by Zinc Doping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural stability and electrochemical performance of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 spinel were significantly improved through mitigating the dissolution of Mn during cycling by simple Zn doping.








ABSTRACT
The spinel compound LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) has attracted increasing attention as a potential cathode material for high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) of the next generation. Despite its attractive properties, LNMO suffers from transition&#8208;metal ion dissolution and pronounced capacity fading, which significantly limit its practical implementation. To address these limitations, Zn is introduced into the LNMO structure to prepare Zn&#8208;doped LNMO, designed to stabilize the 16c and 8a sites and thus improve its electrochemical performance. This doping approach improves the structural robustness of LNMO and significantly suppresses Mn dissolution during electrochemical cycling. Even after 1000 cycles at a current rate of 1 C (1 C = 147&#160;mA g&#8722;1), the Zn&#8208;LNMO sample maintains 81.2% of its original capacity, demonstrating substantially improved capacity retention. Moreover, the Zn&#8208;LNMO electrode maintains 98.8% of its initial voltage after 1000 cycles, and the corresponding average decline in voltage is as low as 0.06&#160;mV for each cycle. This study establishes an atomically engineered doping concept that can be generalized to various cathode systems and serves as an effective guideline for designing high&#8208;performance LIBs.

         <title>Core Shell {001}&#8208;TiO2@APF Heterojunction Photocatalysts for Enhanced Water Treatment Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study confirms the formation of Ti&#8208;O&#8208;C covalent bonds at the interface between TiO2 and APF through XPS analysis, effectively addressing charge transport challenges, promoting rapid carrier migration, and significantly enhancing the degradation rate of glyphosate.








ABSTRACT
The efficient separation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers remain a difficult challenge in photocatalysis. While the heterojunctions are an effective strategy for promoting photogenerated charge separation, inefficient migration at the interface often hinders the development. Herein, we report a core&#8208;shell organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid system, TiO2@3&#8208;aminophenol formaldehyde resin spheres ({001}&#8208;TiO2@APF) for photocatalytic water treatment. The {001}&#8208;TiO2@APF heterojunction achieves a 100% degradation efficiency of glyphosate in 6&#160;h with a reaction rate constant of 0.0068 min&#8722;1, which is 6.2 times that of APF (0.0011 min&#8722;1) and 1.3 times that of bare TiO2 (0.0051 min&#8722;1). XPS analysis confirms the formation of Ti&#8208;O&#8208;C covalent bonds at the organic&#8208;inorganic interface, which effectively addresses the charge transport challenge and facilitates rapid carrier migration across the heterojunction. This work underscores the importance of atomic&#8208;level interfacial engineering in constructing high&#8208;efficiency inorganic&#8208;organic photocatalysts for sustainable water purification.

         <dc:description>
We report an efficient method for late&#8208;stage installation of &#8220;clickable&#8221; alkyne groups into diverse (hetero)arenes. Using a dual&#8208;ligand palladium catalyst that combines an NASA ligand with an N&#8208;heterocycle, an acrylate unit bearing a terminal alkyne can be introduced via nondirected C&#9472;H activation. This approach enables broad substrate scope and delivers products suitable for subsequent CuAAC reactions.








ABSTRACT
Herein, we present a highly efficient method for the late&#8208;stage introduction of &#8220;clickable&#8221; alkyne moieties into different (hetero)arene scaffolds. A highly efficient dual ligand&#8208;based palladium catalyst combining an N&#8208;acylsulfonamide (NASA) ligand with an N&#8208;heterocycle enables the introduction of acrylate moiety bearing a terminal alkyne via nondirected C&#9472;H activation, providing a versatile platform for subsequent bioconjugation or activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP) applications. The utility of the method is demonstrated through a broad substrate scope and the subsequent use of the obtained products in representative click reactions.

         <title>A Bifunctional Small Molecule Degrader of the Long Noncoding RNA MALAT1 Triplex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeting disease&#8208;linked RNAs with small molecules is often limited by the modest impact of binding RNA structure alone. Here, we present a first&#8208;in&#8208;class bifunctional molecule that degrades the oncogenic lncRNA MALAT&#8208;1 by inducing proximity between the RNA and a cleaving warhead. The approach presented herein underscores the relevance of converting a binder into a degrader for generating biological activity beyond simple RNA binding.








ABSTRACT
The targeted degradation of RNA, particularly long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), holds immense potential for therapeutic interventions in diseases associated with aberrant RNA regulation. Here, we introduce a novel Proximity&#8211;Induced Nucleic Acid Degrader (PINAD&#8211;1), a first&#8208;in&#8208;class small molecule that selectively induces the degradation of MALAT1, a lncRNA implicated in the regulation of metastatic processes. PINAD&#8211;1 is designed by conjugating a binder specific for the triple helix structure of MALAT1 to an imidazole&#8208;based RNA&#8208;degrading warhead, enabling specific cleavage of the MALAT1 transcript in vitro and in cellulo, with minimal off&#8208;target effects on the structurally similar NEAT1 lncRNA. Through mechanistic studies, we show that effective RNA degradation is not solely dependent on proximity but requires a precise structural context, as demonstrated by the differential activity of PINAD&#8211;1 compared to the structurally analogous but functionally inert conjugate PINAD&#8211;2. Our findings underscore the importance of binder&#8208;induced destabilization and RNA geometry in facilitating RNA degradation. This work lays the foundation for the design of bifunctional small&#8208;molecule RNA degraders as powerful tools for the modulation of structured noncoding RNAs, offering potential applications in RNA&#8208;based therapeutics.

         <title>Insights Into Symmetry and Substitution Patterns Governing Singlet&#8211;Triplet Energy Gap in the Chemical Space of Azaphenalenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









ABSTRACT
Molecules that violate Hund's rule by exhibiting an inverted singlet&#8211;triplet gap (STG), where the first excited singlet (S1${\rm S}_1$) lies below the triplet (T1${\rm T}_1$), are rare but hold great promise as efficient fifth&#8208;generation light emitters. Azaphenalenes (APs) represent one of the few known molecular classes capable of such inversion of the S1${\rm S}_1$/T1${\rm T}_1$ energy ordering, yet a systematic exploration of all unique APs is lacking. Here, we investigate 104 distinct APs and classify them based on their adherence to or deviation from Hund's rule using S1${\rm S}_1$&#8211;T1${\rm T}_1$ gaps computed with the second&#8208;order coupled&#8208;cluster method employing the Laplace transform (L&#8208;CC2). To capture substitution&#8208;dependent pseudo&#8211;Jahn&#8211;Teller distortions that are inadequately described by MP2 and DFT methods, we employ a focal&#8208;point extrapolation scheme to obtain near&#8208;CCSD(T)/cc&#8208;pVTZ&#8208;quality geometries. We find 3 APs to undergo D3h&#8594;C3h$D_{\rm 3h} \rightarrow C_{\rm 3h}$ and 10 to show C2v&#8594;Cs$C_{\rm 2v}\rightarrow C_{\rm s}$ symmetry lowering, leading to a total of 117 configurations of 104 unique APs. Our study identifies top candidates with inverted STGs, revealing how substitution and symmetry&#8208;lowering modulate these gaps to uncover new stable AP cores that provide promising targets for designing molecular light&#8208;emitters.

         <title>Emissive Liquid Crystalline Boron C,N&#8208;Chelates: Synthesis, Self&#8208;assembly, and Photophysical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel emissive liquid crystalline boron C,N&#8208;chelates were prepared by integrating mesogenic units into the boron C,N&#8208;core. Depending on the substituent at the boron, stable SmA or N mesophases were achieved while maintaining intense blue emission with excellent quantum yields (61%&#8211;100%).








ABSTRACT
A library of novel phenylpyridine&#8208;based boron C,N&#8208;chelates bearing a mesogenic unit was synthesized and investigated to clarify how the chain type, length, and number, as well as the boron substitution (BH2 vs. BMe2) influence the mesomorphic and photophysical behavior. All BH2 derivatives exhibited SmA or N phases even with short alkyl chains, whereas BMe2 analogues remained nonmesomorphic unless a semi&#8208;perfluorinated chain was introduced, demonstrating the strong influence of boron substitution on mesophase formation. All compounds displayed intense blue emission in solution, with spectral properties primarily determined by the boron C,N core and only minor shifts induced by variation in the mesogenic unit in agreement with complementary DFT calculations. Quantum yields reached up to 100% in solution. These results demonstrate that mesomorphic behavior can be introduced and tuned while preserving the excellent photophysical performance of the boron&#8208;C,N&#8208;chelate system.

         <title>Bimetallic MOFs With Enzyme&#8208;Mimetic Active Sites for Nerve Agent Detoxification: Synergistic Insights Into Impeccable Performance From Experiment and Theory</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bimetallic MOF incorporating enzyme&#8208;mimetic active sites exhibits outstanding catalytic efficiency for the rapid and selective detoxification of nerve agents. Comprehensive experimental investigations, complemented by theoretical modeling, reveal the synergistic interplay between the dual&#8208;metal centers and the framework architecture, underpinning its exceptional performance.








ABSTRACT
Nerve agents pose severe risks to human health, underscoring the need for efficient decontamination strategies. This study explores metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) as catalytic platforms owing to their structural tunability, redox&#8208;active metal centers, and abundance of Lewis acidic sites. Single&#8208; and bimetallic UiO&#8208;series MOFs incorporating Ce(IV) and Zr(IV) (confirmed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry) were synthesized using different approaches, including ligand exchange and controlled crystal growth, with four ligands: BDC, BDC&#8211;NH2, BDC&#8211;NO2, and BDC&#8211;(OH)2. These frameworks were systematically evaluated for the hydrolysis of p&#8208;nitrophenyl phosphate (PNPP), a simulant for G&#8208; and V&#8208;type nerve agents (e.g., sarin, VX). The design strategy leverages the redox activity and cooperativity of Ce/Zr nodes, alongside the caging effect of the MOF architecture, to enhance catalytic efficacy. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided mechanistic insights into sarin degradation, revealing how metal composition and linker functionality govern substrate binding and activation. Experimental results demonstrated that bimetallic Ce/Zr&#8208;MOFs with electron&#8208;withdrawing functional groups exhibit significantly accelerated hydrolysis under basic aqueous conditions. Notably, a Ce/Zr&#8208;MOF with &#8211;NO2 functionality achieved the shortest half&#8208;life of 1.16&#160;min. These findings highlight Ce/Zr&#8208;UiO frameworks as promising candidates for real&#8208;world nerve agent decontamination technologies.

         <title>Uncertainty Calibration in Molecular Machine Learning: Comparing Evidential and Ensemble Approaches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Raw uncertainty estimates from deep evidential regression and deep ensembles are systematically miscalibrated. Post hoc calibration aligns predicted uncertainty with true errors, improving reliability and enabling efficient active learning and reducing computational cost while preserving predictive accuracy.








ABSTRACT
Machine learning (ML) models are increasingly used in quantum chemistry, but their reliability hinges on uncertainty quantification (UQ). In this study, we compare two prominent UQ paradigms&#8212;deep evidential regression (DER) and deep ensembles&#8212;on the QM9 and WS22 datasets, with a specific emphasis on the role of post hoc calibration. Raw uncertainties from both methods were systematically miscalibrated: DER produced uncertainty estimates where data noise and model uncertainty were not cleanly separated, while ensembles produced sharper yet underconfident estimates. Applying calibration techniques such as isotonic regression (ISR), standard scaling, and GP&#8208;Normal corrected these deficiencies, aligning predicted variances with observed errors. On QM9, calibration enabled DER to filter high&#8208;confidence predictions more effectively than ensembles. On WS22, calibrated ensembles not only improved statistical reliability but also delivered substantial computational savings in active learning, reducing redundant ab initio evaluations by more than 20%. These results demonstrate that post hoc calibration is essential to transform uncertainty estimates from descriptive metrics into actionable signals, ensuring both trustworthy predictions and resource&#8208;efficient molecular modeling.

         <title>Enhanced Thermoelectric Performance of Dithienopyrrole and Thienoisoindigo&#8208;Based Conjugated Polymers by Introducing Thiophene Spacers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2',3'&#8208;d]pyrrole (DTP) and thienoisoindigo (TIIG)&#8208;based D&#8208;A conjugated polymers were synthesized and characterized as TE materials. Through introducing thiophene units as spacers between DTP and TIIG, PTIIG&#8208;2T&#8208;DTP exhibits enhanced backbone coplanarity as well as molecular packing in thin films, which facilitates the charge transport and results in the enhancement of TE performance.








ABSTRACT
Donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) conjugated polymers hold significant potential as high&#8208;potential thermoelectric (TE) materials due to their adjustable structures, efficient charge transport ability and tunable doping level. However, achieving a balance between the Seebeck coefficient (S) and electrical conductivity (&#963;) remains challenging. In this work, we employ thienoisoindigo (TIIG) as the acceptor and dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2',3'&#8208;d]pyrrole (DTP) as the donor to construct two novel D&#8208;A conjugated polymers for TE application. Through introducing thiophene (T) units as spacers between DTP and TIIG, PTIIG&#8208;2T&#8208;DTP enhances the planarity of conjugated backbones compared to PTIIG&#8208;DTP. Moreover, PTIIG&#8208;2T&#8208;DTP film shows more compact packing between conjugated backbones, which improves the charge transport. Despite slightly lower doping efficiency, doped PTIIG&#8208;2T&#8208;DTP exhibits superior carrier mobility and conductivity to PTIIG&#8208;DTP. Additionally, PTIIG&#8208;2T&#8208;DTP shows a higher Seebeck coefficient at same doping concentration. Ultimately, PTIIG&#8208;2T&#8208;DTP achieves a large power factor of 23.2 &#181;Wm&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 with &#963; of 120 S cm&#8722;1 which is much higher than that of PTIIG&#8208;DTP. This work develops an effective polymer backbone engineering strategy for developing high&#8208;performance D&#8208;A conjugated TE polymers.

         <title>In&#8208;situ Growth of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 on Carboxymethylated Cellulose Beads for Enhanced Low Concentration Fluoride Ions Removal From Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









ABSTRACT
The development of high&#8208;capacity and selective adsorbents for fluoride (F&#8722;) removal is hindered by its inherent characteristics, including its small ionic radius, high charge density, strong hydration ability, high mobility and solubility, as well as the weak diffusion driving force at low concentrations. In this study, a novel composite adsorbent was prepared by loading UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 onto carboxymethylated cellulose beads (UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2@CMCBs) via an in&#8208;situ generation strategy for efficient adsorption and recovery of F&#8722;. The highly porous structure and abundant surface carboxyl groups of CMCBs provide favorable coordination sites, promoting the growth of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2. Under environmental conditions (25&#176;C, pH 7.4), UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2@CMCBs completely remove F&#8722; from aqueous solutions with an initial concentration of 10.0&#160;mg L&#8722;1. Furthermore, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2@CMCBs demonstrated excellent column adsorption performance and outstanding reusability, maintaining a removal efficiency exceeding 80% after 5 cycles. These results highlight the potential of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2@CMCBs as an efficient and recyclable adsorbent for the practical treatment of fluoride&#8208;contaminated water.

         <title>The Evolving Enantioselective C&#9472;H Functionalization of Tertiary Allylic Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
The direct functionalization of tertiary and other inert allylic C&#9472;H bonds represents one of the most attractive strategies in the construction of complicated molecules with quaternary carbon centers. Unlike approaches that rely on pre&#8208;functionalized allylic substrates, such as halides, acetates, and carbonates, allylic C&#9472;H activation provides an atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economical route to forge diverse and valuable C&#9472;C and C&#9472;X bonds. Although the functionalization of secondary allylic C&#9472;H bonds has been extensively studied and well established in recent years, the corresponding transformation of tertiary allylic C&#9472;H bonds remains considerably underdeveloped. This concept summarizes the progress and mechanistic pathways&#8212;including transition&#8208;metal insertion (via two&#8208;electron transfer) and radical&#8208;involving single&#8208;electron transfer processes&#8212;enabling the functionalization of various tertiary allylic C&#9472;H bonds. Future directions in this long&#8208;standing and challenging field are also discussed.

         <title>Chalcogen&#8208;Bridged Metal&#8208;Free Organic Room Temperature Phosphorescence Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

ABSTRACT
Recent development in the field of organic luminescent materials has gained tremendous attention, particularly due to the materials which exhibit efficient room temperature phosphorescence (RTP). The extensive research in the field has led to variety of metal&#8208;free pure organic systems exhibiting excellent performance such as high quantum yield, longer lifetime, and afterglow at ambient conditions. A wide range of strategies were developed to enhance the RTP efficiency, among which the incorporation of chalcogen atoms such as O, S, Se, and Te at bridging position in pure organic system has emerged as a promising strategy. The bridging of the chalcogens atoms not only facilitates the strong spin orbit coupling (SOC) and efficient intersystem crossing (ISC), but also provide more rigid molecular framework to reduce the nonradiative decay pathways and stabilizes the triplet excitons, resulting in RTP with higher quantum yield and longer lifetime. This review focuses on the development of bridged chalcogen&#8208;containing pure organic RTP materials with various strategies to achieve more efficient RTP and their applications. In particular, we discuss and compare a broad range of chalcogen containing organic phosphors, highlighting their structural differences and design strategies that affect the phosphorescence under ambient condition.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Carbon Nitride Copolymers: Enhanced Carrier Dynamics Toward Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyridine rings were incorporated into carbon nitride via a Schiff base reaction, constructing a donor&#8208;acceptor configuration. This structure delocalizes the &#960;&#8208;conjugated charge distribution, generating an internal electric field that facilitates the dissociation and migration of photogenerated electrons and holes, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance.








ABSTRACT
Slow carrier dynamics is the primary impediment for graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) to realize its practical application in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. In this work, we introduced pyridine groups into g&#8208;C3N4 via Schiff base reaction, targeting a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) system among g&#8208;C3N4 to promote the dissociation and migration of photogenerated charge and hole. The D&#8208;A system induced an internal electric field by delocalizing the &#960;&#8208;conjugated charge distribution. The optimized catalysts achieved an enhanced catalytic activity of 3058&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. The main reason for this outperformance is attributed to the improved carrier dynamics resulting from the D&#8208;A system. In addition, multiple characterizations and DFT results indicate that the incorporation of pyridine rings could broaden the response range of visible light and selectively break hydrogen bonds to lower the barrier for charge transfer. This work confirms the structure and interaction in intramolecular framework and provides a facile way to accelerate photogenerated carriers&#8217; migration in g&#8208;C3N4.

         <title>Noncatalytic [2+2] Cycloaddition Providing Donor&#8208;Acceptor Type 2&#8208;Azetines Featuring the 2&#8208;Aminophenyl Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron&#8208;abundant terminal alkynes did not require a catalyst for the [2+2] cycloaddition with 3,3,3&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;2&#8208;((methylsulfonyl)imino)propanoate [CF3C(=NMs)CO2Et] affording the isolable 2&#8208;azetines. The 2&#8208;azetines involving the pyramidalized flanking amino group in the donor&#8208;Aryl&#8208;acceptor system show blue fluorescence. We also found that the [2+2] cycloaddition using the azole&#8208;substituted terminal phenylacetylenes accompanied no byproducts.








ABSTRACT
In contrast to the previously reported TiCl4&#8208;catalyzed [2+2] synthesis of 2&#8208;azetines using internal alkynes and ethyl 3,3,3&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;2&#8208;((methylsulfonyl)imino)propanoate [CF3C(&#9552;NMs)CO2Et], electron&#8208;abundant terminal alkynes do not necessarily require a catalyst for the [2+2] cycloaddition process. In this study, we demonstrate that the 2&#8208;azetines, which were produced by using 2&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;N,N&#8208;dialkylanilines (ArC&#8801;CH, Ar = 2&#8208;R2NC6H4, R = alkyl), showed blue fluorescence (&#934; = 4&#8764;9%). The structural elucidation, using X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, of the fluorescent 2&#8208;azetines involved the pyramidalized flanking amino groups, as steric congestion prevented conventional &#960;&#8208;conjugation between the amino and phenylene units. It is noteworthy that the C&#9552;C unit in the 2&#8208;azetine cycle plays a crucial role in the fluorescent character, and saturation of the double bond afforded the nonfluorescent azetidine derivative. Thus, the combination of the electron&#8208;donating pyramidal amino group and the electron&#8208;accepting &#960;&#8208;molecular skeleton, including the appropriate bridging aryl spacer, is a promising molecular design for developing unique photo&#8208;functional N&#8208;heterocyclic materials. In addition, to investigate the o&#8208;aminophenyl effect on the 2&#8208;azetine framework, we employed the azole&#8208;substituted phenylacetylenes for the [2+2] cycloaddition. 2&#8208;(N&#8208;Pyrrolyl) and 2&#8208;(N&#8208;indolyl)phenylacetylenes facilitated the [2+2] cycloaddition process predominantly and afforded the corresponding 2&#8208;azetines exclusively, whereas the [2+2] synthesis reported so far included the byproducts.

         <title>Ambident Reactivity in the Phenyl + NO Radical Recombination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

ABSTRACT
The recombination reaction of nitric oxide (NO) with radicals via its oxygen atom, rather than the more common nitrogen site, offers an intriguing pathway to the formation of oxynitrenes. The photochemical isomerization of nitroso compounds into their corresponding oxynitrenes may involve such a step. However, because this reaction typically proceeds under continuous irradiation, the formation mechanism has so far remained obscure. In this work, we investigate the recombination of the phenyl radical with NO strictly under thermal conditions, using infrared (IR) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. A proximal radical pair is generated in a solid argon matrix by photolysis of nitrosobenzene at 254&#160;nm. Upon annealing the matrix to 30 K, the radicals undergo a thermal reaction that yields both nitrosobenzene and phenoxynitrene, notably in comparable amounts. NEVPT2 computations show that phenoxynitrene forms on the 1&#8208;1A&#8242; singlet surface, intersecting the 1&#8208;3A&#8242;&#8242; triplet ground state 1.0&#160;kcal&#160;mol&#8722;1 below the separated reactants. At this crossing point, a substantial spin&#8211;orbit coupling (55 cm&#8722;1) enables two&#8208;state reactivity, thereby illuminating the mechanism behind this elusive transformation.

         <title>Ion&#8211;Molecule Reaction Products as Probes and Precursors for Preparative Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion&#8211;molecule reactions in the gas phase of mass spectrometers are important for preparative mass spectrometry because they (1) provide knowledge about the intrinsic reactivity of ions, helping to predict and control their reactivity at interfaces, and (2) generate new complex ions that can be mass selected and deposited on surfaces.








ABSTRACT
The investigation of ion&#8211;molecule reactions in mass spectrometers (i.e., bond formation between a reactive gaseous ion and a neutral reagent) is a well&#8208;established method for analyzing fundamental ion reactivity. However, the potential of such reactions to generate new ions used in preparative mass spectrometry has only recently come into focus. This concept article highlights the dual significance of ion&#8211;molecule reaction products in preparative mass spectrometry: First, they provide valuable insights into the intrinsic reactivity and selectivity of reactive ions in the gas phase, forming the foundation of their reactions at molecular interfaces during ion deposition. Second, the gaseous products themselves can be deposited as mass&#8208;selected building blocks for synthesizing thin films and functional materials. Herein, we discuss opportunities and challenges involved in translating knowledge from the gas&#8208;phase chemistry of reactive ions to interface reactivity. This includes considerations such as the comparability of reaction partners, changes in the nature of ions upon deposition, the emergence of new reaction pathways in condensed phases, and orientation effects at interfaces. A mechanistic understanding of the gas&#8208;phase reactions of reactive ions, as well as the mass&#8208;selected deposition of their products, is opening up new possibilities in surface functionalization and thin&#8208;layer synthesis.

         <title>Controlling Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission by Sterics in Nitrogen&#8211;Boron&#8211;Nitrogen (NBN)&#8208;Doped Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;Like Molecular Propellers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrogen&#8211;boron&#8211;nitrogen (NBN)&#8208;substituted molecular propellers are presented as structural framework for aggregation induced emission (AIE) applications. Steric hindrance is revealed to steer maximum&#8208;AIE behavior, leading to refined control over assembly&#8208;induced luminescence.








ABSTRACT
The phenomenon of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) serves as a promising tool to harness and boost emission properties in luminescent materials. Here, we report nitrogen&#8211;boron&#8211;nitrogen (NBN)&#8208;substituted molecular propellers with different degrees of steric hindrance. Photoluminescence measurements demonstrated that each compound presents AIE behavior in THF/water mixtures, where the less sterically hindered derivative was characterized by higher emission enhancement due to a more pronounced restriction of intramolecular rotations (RIR). A less common maximum behavior was observed upon further addition of water, and this became more pronounced for the more hindered derivative driven by stronger intermolecular electronic effects. Steric hindrance thus serves as an effective design tool to enhance maximum AIE behavior in molecular propellers and gain more precise solvent control.

A less common maximum behavior was observed upon further addition of water, and this became more pronounced for the more hindered derivative driven by stronger intermolecular electronic effects. Steric hindrance thus serves as an effective design tool to enhance maximum AIE behavior in molecular propellers and gain more precise solvent control.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mono(Silylene)&#8208;Stabilized Borylenes for Small Molecule Activation</title>

Quantum chemical calculations suggest the viability of silylene&#8208;stabilized borylenes in small molecule activation.








ABSTRACT
Although base&#8208;stabilized borylenes are now a decade&#8208;old concept, the number of experimentally isolable mono(Lewis base)&#8208;stabilized borylenes is scarce. In this work, we have designed a few mono(Lewis base)&#8208;stabilized borylenes with silylenes as the Lewis base. Quantum chemical calculations revealed that the designed systems possess appreciable donor and acceptor properties that motivated us to investigate their potential toward the splitting of enthalpically strong E&#8211;H bonds (E = H, CH3, NHPh) as well as binding of CO and N2. All the activation and the binding processes by the proposed borylenes were found to possess either better or comparable activation barriers compared to that obtained for cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene&#8208;stabilized borylene.

         <title>Chalcogen&#8208;Substituted Molecular Rotors as Polarity and Viscosity Sensors for Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Fibril Formation and Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper describes the chalcogen&#8208;substituted chromone&#8208;based fluorescent rotors (O, S, Se, Te) showing tunable charge transfer, strong solvatochromism, viscosity&#8208;sensitive fluorescence, and red&#8208;shifted emission with high quantum yields in viscous media. The dyes are stable, bright, and useful for the amyloid fibril detection and cellular microviscosity imaging.








ABSTRACT
Fluorescent molecular rotors (FMRs) sense their local environment by coupling emission to intramolecular rotation and twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT). Here we introduce a compact chromone&#8208;based donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor platform in which the acceptor is systematically chalcogen&#8208;substituted from O &#8594; S &#8594; Se &#8594; Te. This simple, isostructural series allows us to isolate the effect of chalcogen variation on ICT/TICT processes without changing the molecular framework. Steady&#8208;state spectroscopy and DFT reveal progressively narrowed HOMO&#8211;LUMO gaps and strengthened charge&#8208;transfer character across the series, consistent with heavier&#8208;chalcogen polarizability. The dyes exhibit strong solvatochromism and function as viscosity&#8208;sensitive probes: their emission intensity increases steadily with higher glycerol content, following the F&#246;rster&#8211;Hoffmann relationship. They also show a large increase in brightness from water to glycerol and have high quantum yields in viscous media. The probes are chemically robust against common interferents and pH within biologically relevant ranges. By exploiting rotor immobilization, the dye series exhibits strong, time&#8208;dependent fluorescence upon binding to amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;1&#8211;42) fibrils, comparable to Thioflavin T but with a red&#8208;shifted emission. In live HeLa cells the rotors are cell&#8208;permeable and biocompatible, yielding bright organelle labeling and reporting microviscosity changes induced by ionophore or lipid&#8208;loading treatments. Collectively, this study establishes chalcogen&#8208;substituted chromone rotors as a tunable, dual&#8208;function platform for polarity/viscosity mapping and amyloid detection and provides clear structure&#8211;property rules across the O/S/Se/Te series that can guide next&#8208;generation FMR design.

         <title>Catalytic Amyloids: Turning Fibrils Into Biocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amyloids, traditionally associated with diseases, have emerged as versatile catalytic scaffolds. From natural amyloid sequences to bioinspired and de novo designs, we highlight strategies to construct catalytic active sites and anchor enzymes onto fibrils, creating versatile nanomaterials with tunable activities.








ABSTRACT
Amyloids have been regarded as the pathological entities behind neurodegenerative diseases for a long time. The discovery that they also play physiological roles together with their ability to form stable and ordered scaffolds opened the door for their applications in different fields. In this context, catalytic amyloids have emerged as a new class of nanomaterials, merging the efficiency of enzymes with the robustness of heterogeneous catalysts. Indeed, these systems exploit the self&#8208;assembly properties of amyloids while mimicking enzymatic functions by exposing catalytic moieties on their surface. In this review, we first provide an overview of the structural and functional properties of natural amyloids and their application in nanotechnology. Then, we survey the current state of art in the development of catalytic amyloids, based on bioinspired or de novo designed sequences. In both cases, the incorporation of specific functional groups provides the fibrils with catalytic functions. Finally, we illustrate the use of amyloid fibrils as platforms for enzyme immobilization. All the selected examples highlight the power of bridging amyloid structures and catalytic activities to shape innovative nanomaterials toward demanding needs.

         <title>Synthesis, Physicochemical Properties, and Computational Analysis of Tris(fluoromethyl)Alkyl Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tris(fluoromethyl)alkyl (TFTB&#8208;substituted) building blocks (including homologous amines, carboxylic acids, alcohols, and bromides) were prepared from commercially available starting materials. Experimental physicochemical parametrization and computational analysis revealed the resemblance of TFTB with CF3/CF3CH2 groups, providing further rationale into its possible applications in drug discovery.








ABSTRACT
A concise and scalable synthesis of tris(fluoromethyl)alkyl&#8208;building blocks (including amines, carboxylic acids, alcohols, and bromides) starting from commercially available 3,3&#8208;bis(bromomethyl)oxetane is reported. Comprehensive physicochemical profiling of the corresponding amines and carboxylic acids (by measuring their pKa and LogP values), benchmarked against less fluorinated and nonfluorinated counterparts, showed that the tris(fluoromethyl)methyl (&#946;,&#946;&#8242;,&#946;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;trifluro&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl, (FCH2)3C, TFTB) group mimics the electronic and polarity&#8208;modulating properties of CF3 and CF3CH2 substituents despite substantially larger steric volume. Conformational analysis shows that the (FCH2)3C group adopts a restricted set of low&#8208;energy conformations governed by through&#8208;space electrostatic interactions, with C&#9552;O&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#9472;C and C&#9472;F&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#9472;C contacts playing a crucial stabilizing role. Molecular electrostatic potential analysis rationalizes both the anomalous lipophilicity trends and the CF3&#8208;like polarity modulation of this group. Together, these data confirm the TFTB group as a valuable motif for isosteric replacement in drug design.

         <title>Benzoselenadiazole&#8208;based Photosensitizers: Effect of Substituent Position on the Electrochemical, Photophysical, and Photochemical Properties</title>

Tunable donor&#8211;acceptor benzoselenadiazole photosensitizers show efficient singlet oxygen generation and strong visible&#8208;light photocatalytic activity.








ABSTRACT
Selenium&#8208;containing photosensitizers are attracting growing attention for optoelectronic and biomedical applications due to their distinctive redox and photophysical characteristics. Herein, we present a series of novel donor&#8211;acceptor benzoselenadiazole derivatives synthesized via Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig and Ullmann&#8208;type cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Fine&#8208;tuning of the substitution pattern on the benzoselenadiazole core leads to distinct positive solvatochromism, reflecting strong intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer character. Most of the synthesized compounds exhibited efficient singlet oxygen (1O2) generation, with generation quantum yield values (&#934;&#916;) of up to 0.74. Their photocatalytic activity was further demonstrated through the visible light&#8208;driven oxidation of 2&#8208;furoic acid, achieving complete conversion within four hours at a catalyst loading of just 0.05 mol%. The results highlight the potential of benzoselenadiazole&#8208;based chromophores as multifunctional materials for light&#8208;driven applications in photocatalysis, and as promising scaffolds for the future design of photosensitizers.

&lt;p&gt;Selenium-containing photosensitizers are attracting growing attention for optoelectronic and biomedical applications due to their distinctive redox and photophysical characteristics. Herein, we present a series of novel donor&#8211;acceptor benzoselenadiazole derivatives synthesized via Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig and Ullmann-type cross-coupling reactions. Fine-tuning of the substitution pattern on the benzoselenadiazole core leads to distinct positive solvatochromism, reflecting strong intramolecular charge-transfer character. Most of the synthesized compounds exhibited efficient singlet oxygen (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) generation, with generation quantum yield values (&#934;&lt;sub&gt;&#916;&lt;/sub&gt;) of up to 0.74. Their photocatalytic activity was further demonstrated through the visible light-driven oxidation of 2-furoic acid, achieving complete conversion within four hours at a catalyst loading of just 0.05 mol%. The results highlight the potential of benzoselenadiazole-based chromophores as multifunctional materials for light-driven applications in photocatalysis, and as promising scaffolds for the future design of photosensitizers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Breaking the Si/Al Ratio&#8208;Solid Yield Limitation in Hierarchical Nanosized Beta Zeolite Synthesis Enables One&#8208;Step Catalytic Conversion of Lactic Acid to Lactide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple spirocyclic ammoniums enable the alkali&#8208; and fluorine&#8208;free synthesis of nanosized beta zeolites (10&#8211;20&#160;nm) with high yields (&gt;&#160;90%) and tunable Si/Al ratios (10&#8211;70). Featuring hierarchical pores, high surface area, and abundant external active sites, the obtained zeolites exhibit superior catalytic performance in lactic acid&#8208;to&#8208;lactide conversion (83.6% yield with high selectivity).








ABSTRACT
Efforts in zeolite crystal engineering have largely focused on nanosized materials, aiming to enhance mass transport and accessible active sites. For beta zeolite, however, this is often hindered by the intrinsic Si/Al ratio (SAR)&#8208;solid yield trade&#8208;off. Here, we report the synthesis of nanosized beta zeolites, with uniform dimensions of 10&#8211;20&#160;nm, a broad SAR of 10&#8211;70, and excellent solid yields of &gt;&#160;90% under alkali&#8208; and fluorine&#8208;free conditions. These are achieved by using a family of spirocyclic quaternary ammonium salts as organic structure&#8208;directing agents (OSDAs), readily prepared via a simple nucleophilic reaction with commercial precursors. The resulting beta zeolites feature not only hierarchical porosity with a high surface area of &#8764;829&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1 but also abundant external active sites, which enable superior catalytic performance over commercial beta zeolites in the one&#8208;step conversion of lactic acid to lactide, affording 83.6% yield with excellent L&#8208;isomer selectivity. These results demonstrate the unique capability of spirocyclic ammonium OSDAs, opening a new strategy for synthesizing nanosized beta zeolites with simultaneously designed SAR and high yields.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Induced Luminescence in Crystalline Porous Materials: Material System, Optical Behavior, and Structure&#8208;Property Correlations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically analyzes pressure&#8208;induced luminescence in three crystalline porous materials (MOFs, COFs, HOFs). By correlating their structural architectures with optical behavior under compression, it clarifies key structure&#8208;property relationships. The findings offer a design blueprint for next&#8208;generation piezochromic materials with tailored functionalities.








ABSTRACT
Pressure&#8208;induced luminescence (PIL), activated through diamond anvil cell (DAC) techniques, has emerged as a vibrant research frontier with promising applications in sensing, data storage, and optoelectronics. Crystalline porous materials (CPMs), encompassing metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent organic frameworks (COFs), and hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs), offer a uniquely versatile platform for studying and engineering this phenomenon. Their inherent characteristics&#8212;modular design, tunable topology, structural flexibility, and well&#8208;defined porosity&#8212;enable not only reversible and highly tunable piezochromic luminescence but also provide critical insights into fundamental structure&#8208;property relationships under mechanical stress. This review systematically consolidates recent advancements in the PIL of CPMs. We first establish the operational principles of the DAC as the principal pressure&#8208;generating tool. We then categorize and analyze PIL behaviors across the three major CPM families, elucidating how intrinsic factors&#8212;bonding nature (coordinative, covalent, or hydrogen&#8208;bonding), framework dimensionality, ligand chromophores, metal&#8208;node electronics, guest&#8208;framework interactions, and mechanical flexibility&#8212;govern optical responses to hydrostatic pressure generated by a DAC. Key paradigms, including reversible piezochromism, pressure&#8208;induced emission enhancement (PIEE), emission quenching, and ambient&#8208;retained luminescence, are discussed with representative studies. A dedicated comparative analysis synthesizes design principles and performance trade&#8208;offs across material systems. Finally, current challenges and perspectives are outlined to provide guidance for developing efficient, controllable, and multifunctional piezochromic materials with promising applications in advanced photonic technologies.

         <title>Harnessing Toluene Solvent as a Reactant: Regioselective Benzyl Radical Addition to Multi&#8208;&#960; 1,5&#8208;Enynes in a Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade to Indenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component radical cascade of 1,5&#8208;enynes with toluene and benzoic acids enables regioselective benzyl radical addition to multi&#8208;&#928; systems, efficiently delivering polysubstituted indenes from an abundant solvent feedstock.








ABSTRACT
C&#9472;H activation of toluene generates a benzyl radical that undergoes C&#9472;C coupling, converting an abundant solvent into carbon building blocks. A major challenge, however, is to direct the highly reactive benzyl radical to add regioselectively to a multi&#8208;&#960; system in a way that initiates a cascade leading to complex products. Here, we achieved this goal for the first time, to our knowledge, and demonstrated that polysubstituted indene derivatives can be efficiently obtained through a three&#8208;component cascade radical cyclization of 1,5&#8208;enynes with toluene solvent and benzoic acids in the presence of a copper catalyst and TBHP oxidant. Notably, the same indene products were also obtained when aldehydes were used in place of benzoic acids. Our combined experimental and computational investigations fully elucidated the reaction mechanism, showing that it proceeds through a Cu(I/II/III) redox cycle. This study further revealed that benzyl radicals are generated at the outset of the reaction but are highly reactive and prone to deactivation unless they undergo rapid and regioselective addition to the multi&#8208;&#960; system. We show that these requirements are satisfied only when both terminal carbons of the alkene moiety in the 1,5&#8208;enyne bear strong electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents such as CN or CO2Me.

         <dc:description>
Nature's evolutionary processes have equipped organisms with complex structures to thrive in harsh environments. This study examines their structural characteristics and fog&#8208;collection mechanisms, utilizing interfacial tension theory to uncover key principles, while reviewing advancements in bio&#8208;inspired surfaces. By addressing current challenges and suggesting future directions, it seeks to advance the practical implementation of next&#8208;generation fog&#8208;collection systems.








ABSTRACT
Nature showcases extraordinary wisdom through the creation of diverse species, with plants and animals evolving complex adaptive structures to survive in extreme environments. In today's world, where global water resources are increasingly scarce, finding innovative technologies for effective water collection has become an urgent challenge. Fog collection, proven effective in arid and foggy regions, is receiving widespread attention. In particular, biomimetic surfaces, which mimic the fog collection mechanisms found in nature&#8212;such as spider silk, desert beetles, and cacti&#8212;show immense potential. This study delves into these natural prototypes, uncovering their microstructures and the scientific principles behind their fog collection abilities. Using the theory of interfacial tension, the paper provides a comprehensive explanation of their fog collection mechanisms. Additionally, the article reviews the latest advancements in the manufacturing techniques for biomimetic surfaces and fog collection devices, offering a detailed comparison between single&#8208;surface and multi&#8208;surface designs in terms of performance. Finally, the paper evaluates the current challenges faced in this field and envisions the future development of this technology, aiming to drive the practical application of next&#8208;generation fog collection devices and address the global water crisis.

         <title>One Cell at a Time: Single&#8208;Entity Impact Electrochemistry for Bacterial Counting and Functional Profiling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SEIE transforms stochastic bacterial collisions into quantitative readouts of counting, metabolism, and secretion. This concept outlines the governing impact physics, mediator&#8208;gated metabolic access, and secretion&#8208;resolved strategies that together define the current analytical landscape.








ABSTRACT

&lt;p&gt;SEIE transforms stochastic bacterial collisions into quantitative readouts of counting, metabolism, and secretion. This concept outlines the governing impact physics, mediator-gated metabolic access, and secretion-resolved strategies that together define the current analytical landscape.

         <title>Photoelectrochemical Hydrogen Peroxide Production via Simultaneous Reduction and Oxidation Processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an important chemical substance and also a promising carbon&#8208;free clean fuel. The design of a sophisticated photoelectrochemical (PEC) reaction system enables the solar&#8208;driven H2O2 production through simultaneous water oxidation and oxygen reduction processes (H2O2/H2O2&#8208;PEC cells). This review focuses on the H2O2/H2O2&#8208;PEC cells that can achieve Faraday efficiencies exceeding 100% for H2O2, emphasizing the relationship between electrode material properties and cell performances.








ABSTRACT
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an essential substance in chemistry and chemical industry, while being a clean fuel. Currently, research into green and sustainable processes for producing H2O2 is progressing rapidly, with the aim of replacing the energy&#8208;intensive anthraquinone process used in industrial production. Among them, the photoelectrochemical (PEC) method is one that has attracted much attention, because it allows for the solar&#8208;driven production of H2O2 from only water and oxygen. Furthermore, highly designed PEC cells enable the simultaneous production of H2O2 at the anode and cathode (H2O2/H2O2&#8208;PEC cells). This review article focuses on the H2O2/H2O2&#8208;PEC cells having the potential to achieve a Faraday efficiency (&#951;) exceeding 100% for H2O2, with an emphasis on the relationship between electrode materials properties and cell performances. The H2O2/H2O2&#8208;PEC cells can be classified into two types: one involving water oxidation reaction and oxygen reduction reaction (WOR/ORR), and a more recently developed type involving oxygen reduction reaction at both electrodes (ORR/ORR). Based on the fundamental principles of the H2O2/H2O2&#8208;PEC cells, we discussed the electrode material design, and then review some cutting&#8208;edge research on the WOR/ORR&#8208; and ORR/ORR&#8208;PEC cells. Finally, we summarize the conclusions, and outline challenges and perspectives in this hot topic.

         <title>Tetrametallic Terbium/Europium Fluorenylphosphonate With Excellent X&#8208;Ray Scintillating and Photo&#8208;Induced Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetranuclear lanthanide fluorenylphosphonate clusters Eu4 and Tb4, together with chemically mixed Eu/Tb analogues (c&#8208;EuxTb4&#8722;x, where x&#160;=&#160;2.67, 2, 1.33) and physically mixed Eu/Tb materials (p&#8208;yEu4:zTb4, with y:z&#160;=&#160;2:1, 1:1, 1:2), were successfully synthesized. Eu4 and Tb4 exhibit exceptional X&#8208;ray scintillation performance. The luminescence of both c&#8208;EuxTb4&#8722;x and p&#8208;yEu4:zTb4 can be effectively modulated by precisely&#8208;tuning the Eu3+:Tb3+ stoichiometric ratios.








ABSTRACT
This work reports two lanthanide clusters, [Ln4(RPO3)2(RPO3H)(tBuCO2)7(tBuCO2H)3(H2O)3] (Ln&#160;=&#160;Eu, Tb; RPO3H2 denotes (9&#8208;methyl&#8208;9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phosphonic acid). A comprehensive series of characterizations was performed for the Eu4 and Tb4 clusters, including X&#8208;ray crystallography, X&#8208;ray scintillation, and photoluminescence spectroscopy, to elucidate their structural features and physicochemical properties. Notably, these clusters exhibit exceptional X&#8208;ray scintillation performance, attributed to the characteristic luminescence of Ln3+ ions. This finding paves the way for the development of novel scintillator materials and enriches the family of lanthanide&#8208;bearing clusters with X&#8208;ray scintillating properties. Furthermore, photoluminescence modulation was achieved for the chemically mixed Eu/Tb analogues, c&#8208;EuxTb4&#8208;x (x&#160;=&#160;2.67, 2, 1.33), and physically mixed Eu4/Tb4 materials, p&#8208;yEu4:zTb4 (y:z&#160;=&#160;2:1, 1:1, 1:2), with varying the excitation wavelength. Notably, near&#8208;white&#8208;light emission is realized for p&#8208;Eu4:2Tb4 upon excitation at 365&#160;nm. Collectively, these tetranuclear lanthanide phosphonates exhibit excitation&#8208;wavelength and Eu3+:Tb3+ ratio dependent luminescence, indicating their potential as color&#8208;tunable luminescent materials and white&#8208;light&#8208;emitters.

         <title>Simple Access to a Series of Higher Substituted Pentafluoroorthotellurate&#8208;Based Silanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pentafluoroorthotellurate ligand was introduced to organo silanes. A variety of silanes with the formular RxSi(OTeF5)4&#8211;x were synthesized and characterized via spectroscopic techniques and sc&#8208;XRD. The influence of the number of OTeF5 groups on structural properties as well as the fluoride ion affinities (FIA) has been studied and compared to other silanes bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents.








ABSTRACT
The preparation and characterization of RxR&#8242;ySiOTeF5 (R&#160;= Me, Et, iPr, Ph; x&#160;= 3, y&#160;= 0; R&#160;= Pr, tBu, R&#8242;&#160;= Me; x&#160;= 1, y&#160;= 2; 1a&#8208;1f), R2Si(OTeF5)2 (R&#160;= Me, Et, iPr, Ph; 2a&#8208;2d) and RSi(OTeF5)3 (R&#160;= Me, Et, tBu, Ph; 3a&#8208;3d) by reaction of the corresponding chlorosilane and an OTeF5 transfer reagent is presented. Molecular structures in the solid state were obtained for Ph3SiOTeF5 (1f), Ph2Si(OTeF5)2 (2d) and tBuSi(OTeF5)3 (3c). Furthermore, the Lewis acidity was assessed by calculating the fluoride ion affinity (FIA), leading to the observation that a higher number of pentafluoroorthotellurate groups results in an increased FIA.

         <title>Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Route for Covalent Cellulose Fiber Dyeing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a proof of concept for a chemo&#8208;enzymatic approach to the covalent dyeing of cotton fibers. Laccase/TEMPO oxidation introduces aldehyde groups, enabling subsequent reductive amination with amino dyes. Excellent color homogeneity and wash fastness were demonstrated using acid red 33, highlighting the robustness of the approach and its potential relevance for dyeing applications.








ABSTRACT
The conventional textile dyeing process, based on reactive dyes, allows covalent dye fixation but requires toxic or hazardous chemicals that raise significant environmental pollution and health concerns. In this study, we present a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, two&#8208;step chemo&#8208;enzymatic process for grafting aminated dyes onto cotton surfaces. Our aim is to demonstrate the feasibility of covalent dye attachment, while noting that full sustainability has yet to be achieved. First, cotton fibers are oxidized using the laccase/TEMPO system to introduce carbonyl groups, which then react with the amino group of dyes to form C&#8208;N bond through reductive amination. Reductive amination of laccase&#8208;oxidized cotton threads was achieved with rhodamine 123 and acid red 33. Covalent dyeing was evidenced by LC&#8208;MS analyses of hydrolysates obtained after cellulase action. The process was successfully transferred to cotton fabrics, and acid red 33 showed excellent color uniformity and fastness. By comparing results with different dyes (acid red 266, acid violet 19, acid black 41, and acid blue 25), useful criteria to guide dye design were identified. Our study presents a chemo&#8208;enzymatic approach to covalent cotton dyeing and offers insights into the future development of dyes.

Laccase/TEMPO oxidation introduces aldehyde groups, enabling subsequent reductive amination with amino dyes.

&lt;p&gt;The conventional textile dyeing process, based on reactive dyes, allows covalent dye fixation but requires toxic or hazardous chemicals that raise significant environmental pollution and health concerns. In this study, we present a proof-of-concept, two-step chemo-enzymatic process for grafting aminated dyes onto cotton surfaces. Our aim is to demonstrate the feasibility of covalent dye attachment, while noting that full sustainability has yet to be achieved. First, cotton fibers are oxidized using the laccase/TEMPO system to introduce carbonyl groups, which then react with the amino group of dyes to form C-N bond through reductive amination. Reductive amination of laccase-oxidized cotton threads was achieved with rhodamine 123 and acid red 33. Covalent dyeing was evidenced by LC-MS analyses of hydrolysates obtained after cellulase action. The process was successfully transferred to cotton fabrics, and acid red 33 showed excellent color uniformity and fastness.

         <title>Programming the Optoelectronic Properties of Atomically Precise Gold Nanoclusters Using the Conformational Landscape of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
The rational design of hybrid nanomaterials with precisely controlled properties remains a central challenge in materials science. While atomically precise gold nanoclusters (Au&#8208;NCs) offer molecule&#8208;like control over a metallic core, tuning their optoelectronic behavior via surface engineering is often empirically driven. Here, we establish a design principle by demonstrating that the conformational landscape of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDP) can be used as a programmable scaffold to rationally modulate the photophysical properties of a covalently bound Au&#8208;NC. We synthesized a series of bioconjugates between Au25 nanoclusters and bioengineered IDPs containing a variable number of cysteine anchoring points. A combination of mass spectrometry, small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, and modeling on the conjugates indicates that increasing the number of covalent anchors systematically restricts the conformational ensemble, inducing a progressively more compact protein shell around nanoclusters. This structural rigidification at the interface directly translates into a 15&#8208;fold enhancement of the Au&#8208;NC near&#8208;infrared photoluminescence and a six&#8208;fold increase in its average lifetime. Our findings demonstrate that the conformational plasticity of IDPs and the capacity to engineer them can be harnessed as a molecular tuning knob, moving to a new regime of programmable soft&#8208;matter control over the properties of quantum&#8208;confined nanomaterials for tailored biotechnological applications.

         <title>Isocyanide Incorporation Expands the Anticancer Potential of Diiron(I) Aminocarbyne Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Facile incorporation of cyclohexyl and 4&#8208;methoxyphenyl isocyanides into diiron aminocarbyne complexes generates amphiphilic, aqueous&#8208;stable structures. The compounds exhibit potent cytotoxicity across a panel of cancer cell lines in both 2D and 3D models, with NTERA&#8208;2 cells being particularly sensitive, while retaining significant selectivity for malignant over normal cells.








ABSTRACT
Diiron(I) bis&#8208;cyclopentadienyl complexes with a bridging aminocarbyne ligand feature an organometallic scaffold with established anticancer potential. Aiming to expand the structure&#8208;activity relationships, seven new compounds were synthesized by incorporating isocyanide ligands: [Fe2Cp2(CO)(CNFc)(&#956;&#8208;CO){&#956;&#8208;CNMe(R)}]CF3SO3 (Fc&#160;= [Fe(Cp)(&#951;5&#8208;C5H4)], R&#160;= Me, 2a; cyclohexyl&#160;= Cy, 2b; p&#8208;methoxyphenyl&#160;= Anis, 2c; Cp&#160;= &#951;5&#8208;C5H5) and [Fe2Cp2(CO)x(CNR&#8242;)(1&#8208;x)(&#956;&#8208;CO){&#956;&#8208;CNMe(R)}]CF3SO3 (R&#160;= Cy, R&#8242;&#160;= Anis, x&#160;= 1, 3b or x&#160;= 2, 4b; R&#160;= Anis, R&#8242;&#160;= Cy, x&#160;= 1, 3c or x&#160;= 2, 4c). The products were isolated in 70%&#8211;85% yields and characterized by IR, NMR spectroscopy, and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction in one representative case. They display submillimolar water solubility, amphiphilic or moderately lipophilic character, and remarkable inertness in physiological&#8208;like solutions. While the ferrocenyl derivatives 2a&#8211;c exhibited only modest activity, 3 and 4 displayed potent cytotoxicity across a panel of six cancer cell lines, with IC50 values in the low micromolar range in most cases and in the nanomolar range for the NTERA&#8208;2 testis cell line. Moreover, 3b&#8211;c showed significant selectivity toward cancer cells and, along with 4b&#8211;c, retained a remarkable cytotoxic effect in 3D cell spheroids. Complexes 3b&#8211;c were effective in targeting cellular TrxR and increasing cellular ROS production.

         <title>Tuning the Electronic Structure and ROS Generation of BiOCl via Salt&#8208;Mediated Precipitation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple precipitation of the BiOCl photocatalyst in a presence of different metal and metalloid salts result in a broad range of effects on its final properties. Crystal growth, facet exposition, spontaneous formation of substitutional defects, deposition of surface species, optical properties, and ability for the photocatalytic reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation were all affected, many of them being described for the first time.








ABSTRACT
Herein, we investigated how the introduction of different metal salts during the synthesis of bismuth oxychloride affects its electronic structure, revealing that the nature of the metal salt plays a key role in determining the resulting&#160; properties. Several species (Mo, Se, W, V, Ti, Mn, Hg, and Pb) were added to affect the precipitation of the BiOCl photocatalysts. Prepared samples were investigated concerning their crystal structure, elemental composition, morphology, surface area, and optical properties, which were discussed considering possible effects of Bi substitution from the density functional theory calculations. Ti and Hg influence only the crystal growth and morphology. Mo, W, and V, as metallates, shift the absorption to the visible region, but the resulting photocatalytic activity was hindered. Pb2+ and Mn2+ ions substitute for Bi, acting as acceptor defects. Moreover, MnCl2 lead to significant crystal growth and formation of well&#8208;defined {100}, {110}, {101}, and {111} facets. The BiOCl:Mn sample shows increased activity, connected with conduction band (CB) shift and enhanced O2 reduction to &#8729;O2&#8722;. Introduction of SeO32&#8722;&#160;deposits Se4+/S0 species on the surface, leading to the formation of smaller, well&#8208;defined rectangular BiOCl crystals. Surface selenium&#160;acts as electron traps, increasing the charge carriers lifetime and promoting 2&#8208;electron reduction of O2 to H2O2.

         <title>Surficial N+ Charge Density as Key Factor for Inhibition of Pseudomonas Biofilm Formation in Non&#8208;Leaching Quaternary Ammonium&#8208;Modified Polydimethylsiloxane Coatings</title>

Biological fouling threatens marine ecosystems and infrastructures, demanding sustainable solutions. We designed PDMS materials functionalized with quaternary ammonium&#8208;based silanes that inhibit biofilm formation of a highly resilient Gram&#8208;negative Pseudomonas strain. A critical surface charge threshold was identified beyond which adhesion is suppressed. This strategy offers durable and environmentally friendly protection.








ABSTRACT
Marine biofouling represents significant environmental and economic concerns, highlighting the need for sustainable and non&#8208;leaching antifouling materials. In this work, we developed cross&#8208;linked polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) coatings functionalized with methyldimethoxysilanes bearing quaternary ammonium groups and alkyl side chains of two different lengths (C8 and C12). 29Si and 13C solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (CP&#8208;MAS NMR) and Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) confirmed the successful incorporation of silanes into the polymer matrix. Surface analysis was carried out by fluorescein assay, surface roughness, and contact angle measurements. Antifouling assays against Pseudomonas delhiensis PS27, a robust Gram&#8208;negative strain exhibiting strong resilience to environmental stresses, demonstrated notable biofilm inhibition in coatings with higher charge surface density without affecting the physiological fitness of planktonic cells. An observed minimum effective value of surface charge density (6.23 &#177; 0.76)&#183;1016 N+/cm2 for biofilm inhibition was observed. These findings suggest a link between surficial N+ charge density and antifouling efficacy. The developed coatings represent a promising and durable strategy for environmentally friendly fouling prevention in marine and aquatic environments.
