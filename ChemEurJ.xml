         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Enabled Functionalization of Inert C(Sp3)&#8722;H Bonds via Hydrogen Atom Transfer (HAT) Processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing methods to directly transform C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds is crucial in synthetic chemistry due to its atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economy and the prevalence of C&#8722;H bonds in various organic compounds. This mini&#8208;review summarizes recent advancements of NHC&#8208;catalyzed direct functionalization of &#8220;inert&#8221; C(sp3) &#8722;H bonds for cross C&#8722;C coupling reactions, that were enabled by the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) processes, aiming to inspire distinct insights on the C&#8722;H functionalization by a distinct organocatalytic approach.







Abstract
Developing methods to directly transform C(sp3) &#8722;H bonds is crucial in synthetic chemistry due to their prevalence in various organic compounds. While conventional protocols have largely relied on transition metal catalysis, recent advancements in organocatalysis, particularly with radical NHC catalysis have sparked interest in the direct functionalization of &#8220;inert&#8221; C(sp3) &#8722;H bonds for cross C&#8722;C coupling with carbonyl moieties. This strategy involves selective cleavage of C(sp3) &#8722;H bonds to generate key carbon radicals, often achieved via hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) processes. By leveraging the bond dissociation energy (BDE) and polarity effects, HAT enables the rapid functionalization of diverse C(sp3)&#8722;H substrates, such as ethers, amines, and alkanes. This mini&#8208;review summarizes the progress in carbene organocatalytic functionalization of inert C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds enabled by HAT processes, categorizing them into two sections: 1) C&#8722;H functionalization involving acyl azolium intermediates; and 2) functionalization of C&#8722;H bonds via reductive Breslow intermediates.

         <title>Organic Reactions Enabled by Mechanical Force&#8208;Induced Single Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemistry emerges as a sustainable, solvent&#8208;free alternative to traditional synthesis, minimizing hazardous solvents and waste. This innovative field uncovers reaction pathways once considered impossible with solution&#8208;based techniques. This review seeks to encapsulate the advancements in mechanochemically triggered single electron transfer (SET) reactions involving inorganic substances, metals, polymers, and other materials over recent years.







Abstract
Mechanochemical reactions, achieved through milling, grinding, or other mechanical actions, have emerged as a solvent&#8208;free alternative to traditional solution&#8208;based chemistry. Mechanochemistry not only provides the opportunity to eliminate bulk solvent use, reducing waste generation, but also unveils a new reaction strategy which enables the realization of reactions previously inaccessible in solution. While the majority of organic reactions facilitated by mechanical force traditionally follow two&#8208;electron transfer pathways similar to their solution&#8208;based counterparts, the field of mechanochemically induced single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) reactions has witnessed rapid development. This review outlines examples of mechanochemical reactions facilitated by the SET process, focusing on the reagents that initiate SET, thereby positioning mechanochemistry as a burgeoning field within the realm of single&#8208;electron chemistry.

         <title>An In&#8208;Depth Exploration of Six Decades of the Kr&#246;hnke Pyridine Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The six decades of the so&#8208;called &#8220;Kr&#246;hnke Pyridine Synthesis&#8221; were looked over in detail, charting the reaction set&#8208;up, mechanistic considerations and substitutions patterns, as well as the most common applications of the pyridines synthesized using the Kr&#246;hnke's method. Deviations from the standard approach are showcased, arguing the mechanistic tricks which lead to non&#8208;pyridine compounds.







Abstract
The Kr&#246;hnke Pyridine Synthesis has been discovered about six decades ago (1961), by Fritz Kr&#246;hnke and Wilfried Zecher at the University of Giessen. The original method involved the reaction of &#945;&#8208;pyridinium methyl ketone salts with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds in the presence of a nitrogen source, frequently ammonium acetate. Since its discovery, the Kr&#246;hnke methodology has been demonstrated to be suitable for the preparation of mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;pyridines, with important applications in several research fields. Over the years, a number of modifications to the original approach have been developed and reported, enabling for the broad applicability of these methods even in modern days, also for the synthesis of non&#8208;pyridine compounds. In this critical and tutorial review, we will thoroughly explore and discuss the potential of the original method, the refinements that have been made over the years, as well as some applications arising from each type of pyridine and/or non&#8208;pyridine compounds produced by Kr&#246;hnke's approach.

         <title>Preparation and Optical and Electrochemical Properties of Boron (III) Octafluorosubphthalocyanines with One Triselenole and One Diselenet Ring</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unsymmetric boron (III) subphthalocyanines with a triselenole ring or a diselenete ring and eight fluoro groups were prepared by the reaction of 5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;4,7&#8208;diethylbenzo[1,2,3]triselenole and tetrafluorophthalonitrile with trichloroborane in xylene. When boron (III) subphthalocyanine with the diselenete ring was treated with pentachloro antimonate in dichloromethane or sodium metal in hexane/tetrahydrofuran, the solution showed strong ESR signals.







Abstract
Unsymmetric boron (III) subphthalocyanines with a triselenole ring or a diselenete ring and eight fluoro groups were prepared by the reaction of 5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;4,7&#8208;diethylbenzo&#8208;[1,2,3]triselenole and tetrafluorophthalonitrile with trichloroborane in xylene. The reaction was accompanied by a contraction of the triselenole ring to the diselenete ring. The substrate, dicyanobenzo[1,2,3]triselenole, was prepared by a new procedure via a photolytic demethylenation reaction of 3,7&#8208;diethyl[1,3]diselenolophthalonitrile using a 10&#8197;W white LED light. While triselenolosubphthalocyanine was treated by triphenylphosphine to give the diselenete derivative, the reaction of diselenetosubphthalocyanine with Woolion's reagent produced the expanded triselenole ring. The diselenete derivative reacted with tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)platinum to yield the corresponding platinum complex with Se&#8722;Pt bonds. Q&#8208;band absorption for the products appeared at around &#955;max=590&#8197;nm in the UV&#8208;vis spectrum and weak emission was observed at about &#955;e=620&#8197;nm. When diselenetosubphthalocyanine was treated with pentachloro antimonate in dichloromethane or sodium metal in hexane/tetrahydrofuran, the solution showed strong ESR signals. The structures of model compounds were optimized using the DFT method with the Gaussian 09 program at the B3LYP/6&#8208;31G (d, p) level.

         <title>Aggregation Mechanisms and Molecular Structures of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; in Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amyloid protein aggregation proceeds through two distinct pathways. In one pathway, misfolded proteins undergo nucleation and elongation steps ultimately forming fibrillar aggregates in the bulk solution environment. Alternatively, protein aggregation can be initiated via LLPS and LSPT steps, which further promote amyloid fibrils formation.







Abstract
Amyloid plaques are a major pathological hallmark involved in Alzheimer's disease and consist of deposits of the amyloid&#8208;&#946; peptide (A&#946;). The aggregation process of A&#946; is highly complex, which leads to polymorphous aggregates with different structures. In addition to aberrant aggregation, A&#946; oligomers can undergo liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) and form dynamic condensates. It has been hypothesized that these amyloid liquid droplets affect and modulate amyloid fibril formation. In this review, we briefly introduce the relationship between stress granules and amyloid protein aggregation that is associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Then we highlight the regulatory role of LLPS in A&#946; aggregation and discuss the potential relationship between A&#946; phase transition and aggregation. Furthermore, we summarize the current structures of A&#946; oligomers and amyloid fibrils, which have been determined using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and cryo&#8208;electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;EM). The structural variations of A&#946; aggregates provide an explanation for the different levels of toxicity, shed light on the aggregation mechanism and may pave the way towards structure&#8208;based drug design for both clinical diagnosis and treatment.

         <title>Arylazo&#8208;3,5&#8208;diphenylpyrazole Derivatives: Molecular Probes Exhibiting Reversible Light&#8208;induced Phase Transitions for Energy Storage and Direct Photolithographic Patterning</title>

Three&#8208;in&#8208;one: Azo&#8208;3,5&#8208;diphenylpyrazole derivatives with a long half&#8208;life of Z isomer exhibiting light&#8208;induced phase transition behaviour and possessing excellent energy storage and release characteristics over a wider temperature range and showing photolithography applications.







Abstract
We report azopyrazole photoswitches decorated with variable N&#8208;alkyl and alkoxy chains (for hydrophobic interactions) and phenyl substituents on the pyrazoles (enabling &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking), showing efficient bidirectional photoswitching and reversible light&#8208;induced phase transition (LIPT). Extensive spectroscopic, microscopic, and diffraction studies and computations confirmed the manifestation of molecular&#8208;level interactions and photoisomerization into macroscopic changes leading to the LIPT phenomena. Using differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) studies, the energetics associated with those accompanying processes were estimated. The long half&#8208;lives of Z isomers, high energy contents for isomerization and phase transitions, and the stability of phases over an extended temperature range (&#8722;60 to 80&#8201;&#176;C) make them excellent candidates for energy storage and release applications. Remarkably, the difference in the solubility of the distinct phases in one of the derivatives allowed us to utilize it as a photoresist in photolithography applications on diverse substrates.

         <title>Azopyridinium Ionic Photoswitches: Tuning Half&#8208;Lives of Z Isomers from Seconds to Days in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the design and synthesis of water&#8208;soluble heteroaryl azopyridinium ionic photoswitches (HAPIPs). The variations in the substituents of the five&#8208;membered heterocycle part, counterions, and solvent medium allow us to tune the Z isomer stability from seconds to days.







Abstract
Herein, we describe water&#8208;soluble heteroaryl azopyridinium ionic photoswitches (HAPIPs). We aim to combine variations in five&#8208;membered heterocycles, their substitutions, N&#8208;alkyl groups at pyridinium nitrogen, the position of pyridinium center relative to azo group, counterions, and solvents, in achieving better photoswitching. Through these studies, we successfully tuned the half&#8208;life of Z isomers of the resultant HAPIPs between seconds to days in water. Extensive spectroscopic studies and density functional theory (DFT) computations unravelled the factors responsible for thermal relaxation behavior. Considering the versatility of these photoswitches, the tunability of half&#8208;lives and photoswitching in aqueous medium allows the scope of applications in several fields.

         <title>Synthesis, Characterization and Energetic Properties of Hydroxymethyl&#8208;Bishomocubanone Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bishomocubane based energetic materials were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their applications in novel propellant formulations in rocket propulsion. Various performance parameters were assessed based on TGA&#8208;DTG analysis, BDEs, HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gaps, ESP maps and impact sensitivity (h50). Three derivatives were found to be potential candidates with excellent ballistic performance and good stability for volume limited applications.







Abstract
The present work reports synthesis, characterization and theoretical insights on novel hydroxymethyl&#8208;bishomocubanone derivatives. Twelve new bishomocubanes (BHCs) were synthesized and fully characterized by various spectroscopic techniques and single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. The densities of the title compounds were in the range of 1.30&#8211;1.59&#8197;g/cm3. Density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) based calculations at B3LYP/6&#8208;311++G(d,p) level of theory were performed on ten selected BHC based cage compounds. Propulsive and ballistic properties of newly synthesized hydroxymethyl&#8208;bishomocubanone derivatives in solid and liquid propulsion systems were calculated, and the results suggested that these compounds are superior to conventional fuel RP1 and binder HTPB. The detonation parameters revealed that these compounds are not explosive in nature and safe to use as solid propellants. Furthermore, kinetic and thermal stabilities of the title compounds were determined by HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gap, ESP maps, impact sensitivity (h50) and bond dissociation energies (BDEs) followed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermal analysis (DTA). Three compounds, a dinitroazide (Isp,vac=310.98&#8197;s), a dinitrate (Isp,vac=309.51&#8197;s), and a dinitronitrate (Isp,vac=309.20s) were found to be excellent candidates for volume limited applications.

         <title>Functionalization of Alginate Hydrogels with a Multifunctional Peptide Supports Mesenchymal Stem Cell Adhesion and Reduces Bacterial Colonization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work we report on the functionalization of an alginate hydrogel with a tailor&#8208;made multifunctional peptide containing the cell adhesive RGD motif and the LF1&#8211;11 antibacterial peptide. Such novel multifunctional biomaterial ensures the viability of human mesenchymal stem cells, enhances ALP activity and decreases bacterial infections of both Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative models.







Abstract
Hydrogels with cell adhesive moieties stand out as promising materials to enhance tissue healing and regeneration. Nonetheless, bacterial infections of the implants represent an unmet major concern. In the present work, we developed an alginate hydrogel modified with a multifunctional peptide containing the RGD cell adhesive motif in combination with an antibacterial peptide derived from the 1&#8211;11 region of lactoferrin (LF). The RGD&#8208;LF branched peptide was successfully anchored to the alginate backbone by carbodiimide chemistry, as demonstrated by 1H NMR and fluorescence measurements. The functionalized hydrogel presented desirable physicochemical properties (porosity, swelling and rheological behavior) to develop biomaterials for tissue engineering. The viability of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on the peptide&#8208;functionalized hydrogels was excellent, with values higher than 85&#8201;% at day 1, and higher than 95&#8201;% after 14&#8197;days in culture. Moreover, the biological characterization demonstrated the ability of the hydrogels to significantly enhance ALP activity of MSCs as well as to decrease bacterial colonization of both Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative models. Such results prove the potential of the functionalized hydrogels as novel biomaterials for tissue engineering, simultaneously displaying cell adhesive activity and the capacity to prevent bacterial contamination, a dual bioactivity commonly not found for these types of hydrogels.

Moreover, the biological characterization demonstrated the ability of the hydrogels to significantly enhance ALP activity of MSCs as well as to decrease bacterial colonization of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative models. Such results prove the potential of the functionalized hydrogels as novel biomaterials for tissue engineering, simultaneously displaying cell adhesive activity and the capacity to prevent bacterial contamination, a dual bioactivity commonly not found for these types of hydrogels.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Precisely Designed Ultra&#8208;Small CoP Nanoparticles&#8208;Decorated Hollow Carbon Nanospheres as Highly Efficient Host in Lithium&#8722;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precisely controlling the size of transition metal phosphides (TMPs) is crucial for the development of TMPs&#8208;based efficient host materials for Li&#8722;S batteries. With the help of the spherical polyelectrolyte brush (SPB), ultra&#8208;small CoP nanoparticle&#8208;decorated hollow carbon nanospheres (CoP@C) were synthesized. The CoP@C/S electrode delivered a stable specific discharge capacity due to the suppressed &#8216;&#8216;shuttle&#8217;&#8217; effect and fast reaction kinetics.







Abstract
Designing porous carbon materials with metal phosphides as host materials holds promise for enhancing the cyclability and durability of lithium&#8722;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries by mitigating sulfur poisoning and exhibiting high electrocatalytic activity. Nevertheless, it is urgent to precisely control the size of metal phosphides to further optimize the polysulfide conversion reaction kinetics of Li&#8722;S batteries. Herein, a subtlety regulation strategy was proposed to obtain ultra&#8208;small CoP nanoparticles&#8208;decorated hollow carbon nanospheres (CoP@C) by using spherical polyelectrolyte brush (SPB) as the template with stabilizing assistance from polydopamine coating, which also works as carbon source. Leveraging the electrostatic interaction between SPB and Co2+, ultra&#8208;small Co particles with sizes measuring 5.5&#177;2.6&#8197;nm were endowed after calcination. Subsequently, through a gas&#8208;solid phosphating process, these Co particles were converted into CoP nanoparticles with significantly finer sizes (7.1&#177;3.1&#8197;nm) compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art approaches. By uniformly distributing the electrocatalyst nanoparticles on hollow carbon nanospheres, CoP@C facilitated the acceleration of Li&#8208;ion diffusion and enhanced the conversion reaction kinetics of polysulfides through adsorption&#8208;diffusion synergy. As a result, Li&#8722;S batteries utilizing the CoP@C/S cathode demonstrated an initial specific discharge capacity of 850.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1.0&#8201;C, with a low&#8208;capacity decay rate of 0.03&#8201;% per cycle.

         <title>Direct Access to Benzolactams and Benzolactones via Nickel Catalyzed Carbonylation with CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lactams and lactones are obtained in convenient manner via Ni&#8208;catalyzed carbonylation reaction with CO2. The cross&#8208;electrophile coupling engages AlCl3 as a key additive and its multiple roles are elucidated via a dedicated computational investigation.







Abstract
A new nickel catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling for accessing &#947;&#8208;lactams (isoindolinones) as well as &#947;&#8208;lactones (isobenzofuranones) via carbonylation with CO2 is documented. The protocol exploits the synergistic role of redox&#8208;active Ni(II) complexes and AlCl3 as a CO2 activator/oxygen scavenger, leading to the formation of a wide range of cyclic amides and esters (28 examples) in good to high yields (up to 87&#8201;%). A dedicated computational investigation revealed the multiple roles played by AlCl3. In particular, the simultaneous transient protection of the pendant amino group of the starting reagents and the formation of the electrophilically activated CO2&#8208;AlCl3 adduct are shown to concur in paving the way for an energetically favorable mechanistic pathway.

         <title>Designing Cobalt(II) Complex for Chemoselective Synthesis of 2&#8208;Aryl&#8208;3&#8208;Formyl Indoles from Amino Alcohols and Alcohols&#8224;</title>

This report describes synthesis of an cobalt (II) complex (C1) of N&#8208;((1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methyl)&#8208;2&#8208;(phenylselanyl)ethan amine (L1). The cobalt complex was used as catalyst for a one&#8208;pot cascade reaction between 2&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoaryl)ethanols and benzyl alcohols. Interestingly, chemoselective formation of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;formylindoles was observed instead of N&#8208;alkylated or C&#8208;3 alkylated indoles which was observed in earlier reports. The mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction proceeds through tandem imine formation followed by the cyclization.

         <title>Multicomponent Synthesis of 3(2H)&#8208;Furanones Initiated by Copper(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Alkyne&#8208;Carbonyl Cross Metathesis</title>

         <dc:description>
The cooperative Lewis&#8208; and Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis enables a multicomponent synthesis of 3(2H)&#8208;furanones from 1,3&#8208;diynes, alkyl glyoxylates and water, in which a highly chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselective alkyne&#8208;carbonyl cross metathesis of 1,3&#8208;diynes has been developed and suggested as the initial step of the annulation.







Abstract
The cooperative Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis makes convergent synthesis of 3(2H)&#8208;furanones through a three&#8208;component coupling of 1,3&#8208;diynes, alkyl glyoxylates and water. Control experiments support that Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed highly chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselective alkyne&#8208;carbonyl metathesis of 1,3&#8208;diynes and alkyl glyoxylates might be the initial step of this multicomponent annulation. Further chemo&#8208; and regioselective hydration of the alkyne&#8208;carbonyl metathesis product and subsequent oxa&#8208;Michael addition promoted by Br&#248;nsted acid results in the formation of two C&#8722;O bonds of the five&#8208;membered oxygen heterocycle.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of spiro [fluorene&#8208;9] CAAC Ru complexes was prepared. The dynamic properties and activities of molecular catalysts were tuned with smart design and tailoring. In addition to their high metathesis activity, these new compounds also proved to be excellent hydrogenation catalysts, which allowed the one&#8208;pot production of 1,4&#8208;butanediol, a key compound in the synthesis of biodegradable polymers.

A series of a novel CAAC ligands featuring a spiro&#8208;fluorene group have been synthesized and complexed with ruthenium alkylidenes, yielding the corresponding Hoveyda&#8208;type derivatives as a new family of olefin metathesis catalysts. The novel complexes have been characterized by XRD, HRMS and NMR measurements. The synthetised complexes were tested in catalysis and showed good activity in olefin metathesis, as demonstrated on diethyl diallylmalonate and allyl acetate substrates. The unique backbone in the ligand with the large, yet inflexible condensed system renders interesting properties to the catalyst, exemplified by the good catalytic performance and improved Z&#8208;selectivity. In addition, the complex can also serve as a hydrogenation catalyst in a consecutive (one&#8208;pot) reaction. The latter reaction can convert allyl acetate to butane&#8208;1,4&#8208;diol, a valuable chemical intermediate for biodegradable polybutylene succinate (PBS).

&lt;p&gt;A series of spiro [fluorene-9] CAAC Ru complexes was prepared. The dynamic properties and activities of molecular catalysts were tuned with smart design and tailoring. In addition to their high metathesis activity, these new compounds also proved to be excellent hydrogenation catalysts, which allowed the one-pot production of 1,4-butanediol, a key compound in the synthesis of biodegradable polymers.

         <title>Spatially Resolved Multicolor Luminescence Tuning on the Single 1D Heterogeneous Microrod</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatially resolved 1D heterogeneous microrods that emit variable emission on demand in response to excitation pulse width were developed. This kind of well&#8208;designed 1D heterogeneous microrods can carry a variety of optical features and show great potential in fabricating unclonable anti&#8208;counterfeiting tags.







Abstract
The spatially resolvable multicolored microrods have potential applications in many fields. However, achieving spatially resolved multicolor luminescence tuning on the microrod with a fixed composition remains a daunting challenge. Herein, a strategy is proposed that allows for the tuning of spatially resolved, multicolored upconversion (UC) luminescence (UCL) along a 1D heterogeneous microrod by modifying the pulse width of an external laser. NaYbF4:1&#8201;% Ho is identified as an UCL color&#8208;adjustable material, exhibiting pulse width&#8208;dependent multicolored UCL, resulting in a significant regulation of the red/green (R/G) ratio from 0.1 to 10.3 as the pulse width is varied from 0.1 to 10&#8197;ms. Such variability can be ascribed to differences in the number of photons incident upon the microrod throughout the period necessary for the UC process to occur. Additionally, NaYbF4:1&#8201;%Tm and NaYF4:20&#8201;%Yb,1&#8201;%Ho are employed as materials that emit blue and green light, respectively, with their UCL colors largely unaffected by changes in the pulse width. Subsequently, a tip&#8208;modified epitaxial growth method is utilized to integrate both UCL color&#8208;adjustable and non&#8208;adjustable segments within the same microrod. Comparing with single&#8208;color or fixed multicolor microrods, our developed multisegmented emissive color adjustable 1D heterogeneous microrods have unique optical characteristics and can carry more optical information.

         <title>Glyco&#8208;DNA: Enzymatic Synthesis of Base&#8208;Modified and Hypermodified DNA Displaying up to Four Different Monosaccharide Units in the Major Groove</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sugared DNA displaying up to four different glycosides in the major groove has been prepared by DNA polymerase catalyzed primer extension using four different carbohydrate&#8208;linked 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates.







Abstract
A portfolio of six modified 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) derivatives derived from 5&#8208;substituted pyrimidine or 7&#8208;substituted 7&#8208;deazapurine bearing different carbohydrate units (d&#8208;glucose, d&#8208;galactose, d&#8208;mannose, l&#8208;fucose, sialic acid and N&#8722;Ac&#8208;d&#8208;galactosamine) tethered through propargyl&#8208;glycoside linker was designed and synthesized via the Sonogashira reactions of halogenated dNTPs with the corresponding propargyl&#8208;glycosides. The nucleotides were found to be good substrates for DNA polymerases in enzymatic primer extension and PCR synthesis of modified and hypermodified DNA displaying up to four different sugars. Proof of concept binding study of sugar&#8208;modified oligonucleotides with concanavalin A showed positive effect of avidity and sugar units count.

         <title>Synthesis of a Library of Terpenoid Alkaloid&#8211;Like Compounds Containing Medium&#8208;Sized Rings via Reconstruction of the Humulene Skeleton</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized a library of terpenoid alkaloid&#8208;like compounds with diverse heteroatom&#8208;containing ring systems. Our strategy involves the introduction of a nitrogen atom into a humulene skeleton and subsequent ring reconstruction. A tartrate&#8208;resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) assay using a receptor activator of nuclear factor&#8208;&#954;B ligand (RANKL)&#8208;induced RAW264.7 cells allowed identifying a seed compound for bone&#8208;resorptive diseases.







Abstract
The construction of a chemical library based on natural products is a promising method for the synthesis of natural product&#8208;like compounds. In this study, we synthesized a terpenoid alkaloid&#8208;like compound library based on the humulene skeleton. Our strategy, which enables access to diverse ring systems such as 11&#8208;membered monocyclic, oxabicyclic, and medium&#8208;sized aza ring&#8208;containing scaffolds, involves the introduction of a nitrogen atom, an intermolecular C&#8722;O bond formation via Lewis acid&#8208;mediated epoxide&#8208;opening transannulation, and a ring&#8208;reconstruction strategy based on olefin metathesis. A cheminformatics analysis based on their structural and physicochemical properties revealed that the synthesized compounds have high three&#8208;dimensionality and high natural product likeness scores but with structural novelty. The usefulness of the terpenoid alkaloid&#8208;like compound library for drug discovery and the accessibility to structure&#8208;activity relationship studies were validated by performing an assay for osteoclast&#8208;specific tartrate&#8208;resistant acid phosphatase activity, resulting in the identification of a seed compound for bone&#8208;resorptive diseases such as osteoporosis.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Allylic Alkylation at sp3&#8208;Carbon Centers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic allylations have emerged as versatile processes for assembling C&#8722;C or C&#8722;heteroatom bonds. Traditionally, noble transition metals like Pd, Rh, or Ir have been extensively employed for these processes. However, recent sustainable catalytic strategies have shifted towards utilizing base metals as catalysts. Consequently, this review outlines the breakthroughs in cobalt&#8208;catalyzed allylic alkylations, emphasizing their noteworthy advancements in the field.







Abstract
The rising demand and financial costs of noble transition metal catalysts have emphasized the need for sustainable catalytic approaches. Over the past few years, base&#8208;metal catalysts have emerged as ideal candidates to replace their noble&#8208;metal counterparts because of their abundance and easiness of handling. Despite the significant advancements achieved with precious transition metals, earth&#8208;abundant cobalt catalysts have emerged as efficient alternatives for allylic substitution reactions. In this review, allylic alkylations at sp3&#8208;carbon centers mediated by cobalt will be discussed, with a special focus on the mechanistic features, scope, and limitations.

In this paper,&#160;the&#160;organoboron compound B&#8208;BNBP with double B&#8592;N bridged bipyridine bearing four fluorine atoms as core unit is facilely synthesized and exhibits&#160;a&#160;narrowband&#160;emission spectrum and a high photoluminescence quantum yield&#160;(PLQY)&#160;of 86.53% in solution. Its polymorphic&#160;crystals&#160;were controllable prepared by different solution self&#8208;assembly methods. Two microcrystals possess different molecular packing modes, one&#8208;dimensional microstrips (1D&#8208;MSs) for H&#8208;aggregation and two&#8208;dimensional microdisks (2D&#8208;MDs) for J&#8208;aggregation, owing to&#160;abundant intermolecular interactions of four fluorine atoms sticking out conjugated plane. Their structure&#8208;property relationships were investigated by crystallographic analysis and theoretical calculation. Strong emission spectra with the full width at half maximum (FWHM)&#160;of less than 30&#160;nm can also&#160;be&#160;observed in thin film and 2D&#8208;MDs. 1D&#8208;MSs possess thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF)&#160;property and exhibit superior optical waveguide performance with an optical loss of 0.061 dB/&#956;m. This work enriches the diversity of polymorphic microcrystals&#160;and further reveals the structure&#8208;property relationship in organoboron&#160;micro/nano&#8208;crystals.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we used photoinert anhydrous cerium(III) chloride, to form a transient charge&#8208;transfer (CT) complex with NXS (N&#8208;bromosuccinimide or NBS and N&#8208;iodosuccinimide or NIS) in acetonitrile. These transient CT complexes acted as a semi&#8208;heterogeneous photocatalyst. These complexes allowed the Ce(III) ions to absorb light, turning them into strong electron donors that transferred electrons to NXS. This created halide radicals from NXS radical anions, helping to turn N&#8208;propargylamides into oxazole aldehydes. Experiments with DMPO and spin&#8208;trapping showed that a radical&#8208;based mechanism followed a single electron transfer (SET) pathway. Notably, CeCl3 was reused after the reaction without much decomposition, as it was regenerated and separated through simple filtration.</dc:description>

         <title>The Structure of Carbon Dioxide at the Air&#8208;Water Interface and its Chemical Implications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 43, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
According to first&#8208;principles simulations, the ability of carbon dioxide to capture an electron at the air&#8208;water interface should be larger than in bulk solution, which opens interesting perspectives for developing more efficient reduction processes.







Abstract
The efficient reduction of CO2 into valuable products is a challenging task in an international context marked by the climate change crisis and the need to move away from fossil fuels. Recently, the use of water microdroplets has emerged as an interesting reaction media where many redox processes which do not occur in conventional solutions take place spontaneously. Indeed, several experimental studies in microdroplets have already been devoted to study the reduction of CO2 with promising results. The increased reactivity in microdroplets is thought to be linked to unique electrostatic solvation effects at the air&#8208;water interface. In the present work, we report a theoretical investigation on this issue for CO2 using first&#8208;principles molecular dynamics simulations. We show that CO2 is stabilized at the interface, where it can accumulate, and that compared to bulk water solution, its electron capture ability is larger. Our results suggest that reduction of CO2 might be easier in interface&#8208;rich systems such as water microdroplets, which is in line with early experimental data and indicate directions for future laboratory studies. The effect of other relevant factors which could play a role in CO2 reduction potential is discussed.

         <title>Gaining Insights into the Interplay between Optical and Magnetic Properties in Photoexcited Coordination Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 43, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept article explores the understanding of the interplay of electronic and magnetic properties on the optical signatures of 3d&#8211;4f single molecule magnets (SMMs). It presents a combination of multiple time and frequency domain techniques including transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer measurements.







Abstract
We describe early and recent advances in the fascinating field of combined magnetic and optical properties of inorganic coordination compounds and in particular of 3d&#8211;4f single molecule magnets. We cover various applied techniques which allow for the correlation of results obtained in the frequency and time domain in order to highlight the specific properties of these compounds and the future challenges towards multidimensional spectroscopic tools. An important point is to understand the details of the interplay of magnetic and optical properties through performing time&#8208;resolved studies in the presence of external fields especially magnetic ones. This will enable further exploration of this fundamental interactions i.&#8201;e. the two components of electromagnetic radiation influencing optical properties.

         <title>Electronic Current Density Induced by Uniform Magnetic Fields in Clarenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 43, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calculations of the magnetic response are reported for few selected clarenes, the most stable isomers among cycloarenes, as identified by maximization of the number of Clar sextets, and tested computationally. Only some of the rings endowed with a Clar sextet show an exaltation of the diatropic ring current, as could have been expected based on previous calculations on different polycyclics.







Abstract
Some planar and non&#8208;planar clarenes have been studied using maps of magnetically induced quantum&#8208;mechanical current density and tools from differential topology to assess their magnetic response in connection with recent results by Du and Wang. Bond current strengths have been computed to estimate quantitative measures. Isosurfaces of the divergence of induced Lorentz force density have been shown to provide useful additional criteria, especially in the case of non&#8208;planar clarenes.

         <title>Customizing Cerium Oxide Particle Synthesis with Hybrid Polyion Complex Templates for Enhanced Oxidation Performance in Photo&#8208;Fenton Processes</title>

Polyionic complexes were used as chemical reservoirs for obtaining a highly efficient cerium&#8208;based catalyst in the photo&#8208;Fenton reaction







Abstract
Hybrid poly&#8208;ion complexes were synthesized through the complexation of a double hydrophilic copolymer with Ce(III) ions. These colloids act as reservoirs for cerium ions, enabling the synthesis of cerium&#8208;based Prussian blue nanoparticles with a cubic structure, a narrow size distribution around 100&#8197;nm, and good colloidal stability in water. Upon high&#8208;temperature calcination, these nanoparticles are transformed into a cerium/iron&#8208;based metal oxide catalyst (CeO2/Fe2O3). The resultant composite catalyst demonstrates superior performance in the photo&#8208;Fenton oxidation of methylene blue pollutants, achieving a conversion efficiency that rivals other metal&#8208;based oxides and cerium&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>Synthesis and Lewis Acid Properties of Neutral Silver(III) Adducts Containing the AgIII(CF3)3 Moiety</title>

The synthetic approaches to [AgIII(CF3)3(NCCH3)] (2) from either [AgIII(CF3)3Cl]&#8722; (3&#8901;Cl) or [AgIII(CF3)4]&#8722; (1), originally reported by Eujen and Naumann, are herein reinvestigated owing to major inconsistencies. Naumann's method provides 2 from 1 and HBF4, yet accompanied by its s&#8208;triazinyl derivative [AgIII(CF3)3(C6H9N3)] (2&#8217;), which is formed in&#8197;situ through nitrile cyclotrimerization enabled by AgIII/H+. In turn, chloride abstraction from 3&#8901;Cl using AgNO3 leads to [AgIII(CF3)3(ONO2)]&#8722; (5) instead of 2, as evidenced by NMR spectroscopy, Sc&#8208;XRD and EA.







Abstract
The acetonitrile AgIII complex [AgIII(CF3)3(NCCH3)] (2) has been reported independently by Eujen and Naumann in the last century, albeit with intriguing NMR discrepancy. In their reports, 2 was claimed to be obtained starting from either [AgIII(CF3)3Cl]&#8722; (3&#8901;Cl) or [AgIII(CF3)4]&#8722; (1) via halide abstraction using AgNO3 or acidic treatment, resp. These two synthetic routes are herein reinvestigated. The feasibility of Naumann's method is demonstrated, thus providing 2 yet accompanied by its s&#8208;triazinyl derivative [AgIII(CF3)3(C6H9N3)] (2&#8217;). The formation of 2&#8217; is unprecedented and was thereby investigated. Both 2 and 2&#8217; were isolated in pure fashion and fully characterized. In turn, halide extraction from 3&#8901;Cl leads to the AgIII&#8208;ONO2 anion 5 instead of 2, as evidenced by NMR spectroscopy, EA and Sc&#8208;XRD.

Abstract
Developing pragmatic strategies for accessing functional benzofuran&#8208;2&#8208;ones from 3&#8208;([1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzofuran remains an enduring challenge. Herein, we have achieved a highly discriminating electrochemical oxidative dearomative spiroannulation of 3&#8208;([1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzofuran, culminating in the synthesis of 2H&#8208;spiro[benzofuran&#8208;3,9&#8242;&#8208;fluoren]&#8208;2&#8208;one derivatives. By harnessing the electrophilic intermediates of benzofuryl radical cations supported by DFT calculations, we attain exceptional regioselectivity while eliminating the need for stoichiometric oxidants. Mechanistic investigations reveal a sequence of events involving the benzofuran radical cation, encompassing the capture of H2O, nucleophilic arene attack, and subsequent deprotonation, ultimately yielding the final benzofuran&#8208;2&#8208;ones.

A sodium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (NaFSI)&#8208;based multifunctional electrolyte is developed by partially replacing NaPF6 salt in the electrolyte to improve the wide temperature range working capability of NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2/hard carbon (NNFM111/HC) sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). The synergistic effect of NaPF6 and NaFSI greatly improves the battery performance in a wide temperature range. It exhibits promising prospect in the application of SIBs.







Abstract
A sodium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (NaFSI)&#8208;based multifunctional electrolyte is developed by partially replacing NaPF6 salt in the electrolyte to improve the wide temperature range working capability of NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2/hard carbon (NNFM111/HC) sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). The capacity retention of the SIBs with NaFSI&#8208;NaPF6 dual salt electrolyte increases from 47.2&#8201;% to 75.5&#8201;% after 250 cycles at 25&#8201;&#176;C, and from 51.0&#8201;% to 82.3&#8201;% after 80 cycles at 45&#8201;&#176;C, and the 1&#8197;C discharge capacity retention at the low temperature of &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C also increases 26.8&#8201;%. In the single salt system, NaPF6 effectively passivate the aluminum foil and NaFSI passivate the electrode/electrolyte interface. The synergistic effect of NaPF6 and NaFSI greatly improves the battery performance in a wide temperature range. This NaFSI&#8208;based dual salt electrolyte also effectively overcomes the flaws when the SIBs using NaFSI or NaPF6 independently, and makes it more suitable for SIBs, indicating promising prospects in the commercial application of NNFM111/HC SIBs.

         <title>peri&#8208;Benzo&#8208;Diindenotetracenyl: Helically &#960;&#8208;Extended Allyl Radical with Robust Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 43, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel hydrocarbon radical, peri&#8208;benzo&#8208;diindenotetracenyl, is described. The helical &#960;&#8208;radical has no peripheral substituents but shows high stability. According to the XRD and theoretical studies, the radical was best described as an allyl radical fused by five Clar's sextets. The optically resolved enantiomers exhibited mirror image CD spectra with |gCD| of 2.4&#215;10&#8722;4. The racemization barrier was determined to be 95.9&#8197;kJ/mol at 298&#8197;K.







Abstract
Here is described the synthesis and characterization of a stable hydrocarbon radical, peri&#8208;benzo&#8208;diindenotetracenyl, with a helical structure. Although the helical &#960;&#8208;radical has no peripheral substituents, it was stable in the solid and solutions. According to the X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and quantum chemical calculations, the radical was best described as an allyl radical fused by five Clar's sextets. The optically resolved enantiomers exhibited mirror image CD spectra with |gCD| of 2.4&#215;10&#8722;4 at 522&#8197;nm. The racemization barrier was determined to be 95.9&#8197;kJ/mol at 298&#8197;K, which is compatible with that of [5]helicene (108&#8197;kJ/mol).

         <title>Development of Fluorenyl&#8208;Based Copolyimines with Adjustable Mechanical Properties, Recyclability and Friction Resistance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 43, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and evaluation of Cardo&#8208;DPIs films have been successfully completed. The presence of the fluorenyl effect, along with ether linkages and a high cross&#8208;linking density of dynamic polyimines, has resulted in films that not only demonstrated superior mechanical properties and self&#8208;healing capabilities but also enabled closed&#8208;loop recycling. Furthermore, the friction and wear characteristics of Cardo&#8208;DPIs have been systematically analyzed.







Abstract
Dynamic polyimines are a class of fascinating dynamic polymers with recyclability and reparability owing to their reversible Schiff&#8208;base reactions. However, balancing the dynamic properties and mechanical strength of dynamic polyimines presents a major challenge due to the dissociative and associative nature of the imine bonds. Herein, we introduced bulky fluorene groups and polyether amine into the skeleton of polyimine networks to achieve a tradeoff in comprehensive properties. The resulting dynamic polyimines with fluorene groups (Cardo&#8208;DPIs) were successfully synthesized by combining the rigid diamine 9,9&#8208;bis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)fluorene and the flexible polyether amine, demonstrating a high tensile strength of 64.7&#8197;MPa. Additionally, Cardo&#8208;DPIs films with more content of rigid fluorene groups exhibited higher water resistance, glass transition temperature and wear&#8208;resisting ability. Moreover, the Cardo&#8208;DPIs films not only efficiently underwent thermal reshaping, but also exhibited excellent self&#8208;healing capabilities and chemical degradation in acidic solutions. Furthermore, the resulting films can achieve fully closed&#8208;loop recovery by free amine solution for 2&#8197;h at room temperature. This study broadens the scope of dynamic polyimine materials and promotes the balanced development of their functional and mechanical properties.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Decarboxylative Allylation of Oxime Esters under Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 43, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective and general photocatalyzed allylation reaction has been established. This transformation that uses simple allyl bromides and oxime esters derived from commercially available and pharmaceutically relevant carboxylic acids, gives access to a wide array of allylic compounds that can be further employed in organic synthesis.







Abstract
Allylation reactions, often used as a key step for constructing complex molecules and drug candidates, typically rely on transition&#8208;metal (TM) catalysts. Even though TM&#8208;free radical allylations have been developed using allyl&#8208;stannanes, &#8208;sulfides, &#8208;silanes or &#8208;sulfones, much less procedures have been reported using simple and commercially available allyl halides, that are used for the preparation of the before&#8208;mentioned allyl derivatives. Here, we present a straightforward photocatalytic protocol for the decarboxylative allylation of oxime esters using allyl bromide derivatives under metal&#8208;free and mild conditions. This methodology yields a diverse variety of functionalized molecules including several pharmaceutically relevant molecules.

         <title>Polycyclic Pyrazolidines by Tandem Diazomalonate Dipolar Cycloadditions and CpRu&#8208;Catalyzed Carbene Additions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 43, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxa/aza benzonorbornadienes and diazomalonates afford polycyclic pyrazolidines via (i) a diastereoselective [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition, (ii) a CpRu&#8208;catalyzed carbene addition, and (iii) a second dipolar [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition. Step (ii) forms novel bench&#8208;stable N,N&#8208;cyclic azomethine imines that are effective 1,3&#8208;dipoles with electron&#8208;poor dipolarophiles.

Thanks to the ability of diazo derivatives to react either as 1,3&#8208;dipoles and as carbenes after dinitrogen extrusion, combinations of oxa or aza benzonorbornadienes and diazomalonates afford polycyclic pyrazolidines via a three&#8208;step sequence of (i) a highly diastereoselective [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition, (ii) a CpRu&#8208;catalyzed carbene addition, and (iii) a second dipolar cycloaddition. Of importance, step (II) represents a unique access to novel bench&#8208;stable N,N&#8208;cyclic azomethine imines, which behave as effective 1,3&#8208;dipoles in combination with electron&#8208;poor dipolarophiles. Each step proceeds efficiently and the 3&#8208;step process can be performed in one&#8208;pot to yield a polycyclic pyrazolidine in excellent overall yield (90&#8201;%).

         <title>Enhanced Co&#8208;Adsorption of Alcohols and Amines for Visible Light Driven Oxidative Condensation Using Iron&#8208;Based MOF</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 43, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhanced co&#8208;adsorption of aromatic alcohols and amines for efficient synthesis of imines under visible irradiation using iron&#8208;based MOF is reported. The co&#8208;adsorption takes place on metal nodes and linker sites separately without influencing the activation of molecular oxygen, thus presenting a high efficiency under mild conditions.







Abstract
Imines are essential intermediates in organic transformations, and is generally produced by dehydrogenative condensation of alcohols and amines with the assist of specialized catalysts and additives. Heterogeneous photocatalysis provides a sustainable platform for such process without the using of toxic oxidants, yet a functionalized photocatalyst with optimized co&#8208;adsorption of reactants needs to be developed to promote the stoichiometric oxidative condensation under ambient conditions. Here, we show that benzyl alcohol and aniline adsorb non&#8208;interferingly on the Fe node and the linker sites of the MIL&#8208;53(Fe) metal organic frameworks (MOFs), respectively. The co&#8208;adsorption of both reactants barely influences the reduction of molecular oxygen to generate oxygen radicals, resulting in efficient formation of benzaldehyde under visible light. Additionally, the weak adsorption of water together with surface acidity of the MIL&#8208;53(Fe) promote a rapid condensation of benzaldehyde with aniline and the depletion of generated water, achieving an efficient C&#8722;N bond creation for a wide range of substrates.

         <title>Optimizing Photocatalytic H2 Production by Introduction of Pyrazinyls to WRCs and a New tris&#8208;Rhenium Photosensitizer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 43, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polypyridyl&#8208;based cobalt catalysts for the hydrogen evolving reaction were optimized by the introduction of electron&#8208;poor pyrazine in place of pyridine. Photocatalysis experiments with a new tris&#8208;rhenium photosensitizer and detailed electrochemical studies showed trends in turnover numbers and H2 evolution rates and gave grounds for hypotheses on the mechanistic pathway.







Abstract
The replacement of pyridyl by pyrazinyl in ligands of polypyridyl&#8208;based cobalt water reducing catalysts (WRC) shifts reduction potentials anodically. Together with a new, trinuclear ReI photosensitizer, these WRCs show strongly improved photocatalytic performances in turnover numbers (TONs) and maximal H2 evolution rate. Depending on the catalyst structure, up to 65&#8197;kTONs at 1&#8197;&#956;M WRC concentration were reached. Under electrocatalytic conditions in both DMF and H2O, one of the reported WRCs displays remarkable stability, producing H2 steadily over 21 and 14&#8197;d, respectively.

Synthesis of natural products and analogs: A unified strategy! This study delineates the synthesis of Ecklonialactone A, B, C, D, and Eiseniachlorides A and B, as well as ent&#8208;Ecklonialactone B, 16&#8208;epi&#8208;Ecklonialactone B, 12,13&#8208;diepi&#8208;Ecklonialactone B, and 12&#8208;chloro&#8208;Eiseniachloride B through a unified and convergent approach.







Abstract
Ecklonialactones, Eiseniachlorides, and Egregiachlorides are synthesized in living organisms via the lipoxygenase&#8208;mediated oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Originally isolated and identified from brown seaweed (Ecklonia stolonifera, Eisenia bicyclis, and Egregia menziesii), and later replicated on milligram scale through chemical synthesis, the full biological activities of these compounds remain to be elucidated. To bridge this gap in knowledge, we propose a unified methodology to synthesize the 14&#8208;membered macrocyclic structures of Ecklonialactones, Eiseniachlorides and analogs using a versatile and convergent approach. This study delineates the synthesis of Ecklonialactone A, B, C, D, and Eiseniachlorides A and B, as well as ent&#8208;Ecklonialactone B, 16&#8208;epi&#8208;Ecklonialactone B and 12,13&#8208;diepi&#8208;Ecklonialactone B.

         <title>Telluronium&#8208;Catalyzed Halogenation Reactions: Chalcogen&#8208;Bond Activation of N&#8208;Halosuccinimides and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 43, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chalcogen bond (ChB) involving the tellurium atom of CF3&#8208;functionalized triaryltelluronium salt and the carbonyl oxygen of N&#8208;chloro&#8208;, N&#8208;bromo&#8208; and N&#8208;iodosuccinimide (NCS, NBS and NIS) was evidenced in the solid state by X&#8208;ray diffraction and in solution by 125Te NMR. This ChB was strong enough in solution to allow catalytic halogenation reactions to occur at room temperature and even at 0&#8201;&#176;C with activated substrates.







Abstract
The ability of triaryltelluronium salts to interact with N&#8208;halosuccinimides (NXS) through chalcogen bonding (ChB) in the solid state and in solution is demonstrated herein. Cocrystals of the triaryltelluronium bearing two CF3 electron&#8208;withdrawing groups per aryl ring with N&#8208;chloro&#8208;, N&#8208;bromo&#8208; and N&#8208;iodosuccinimide (respectively NCS, NBS and NIS) were analyzed by X&#8208;ray diffraction, evidencing a ChB between tellurium and the carbonyl group of NXS. This ChB was confirmed in solution by NMR spectroscopy, especially by 125Te NMR titration experiment, which allowed the determination of the association constant (Ka) between the telluronium and NBS. The so&#8208;obtained Ka value of 17.3&#177;0.6&#8197;M&#8722;1 indicated a moderate interaction in solution because of the competitive role of the solvent. The strength of the Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O ChB was however sufficient enough to promote the catalytic halofunctionalization of aromatics and of alkenes such as the intra&#8208; and intermolecular haloalkoxylation and haloesterification of alkenes.

         <title>Recyclable Homogeneous Catalysis Enabled by Dynamic Coordination on Rhodium(II) Axial Sites of Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 43, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The post&#8208;synthetic coordinative functionalization of Rh(II)&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (Rh&#8208;MOPs) is employed to engineer homogeneous catalysts for styrene aziridination and cyclopropanation reactions. This dynamic coordinative functionalization does not hinder the catalytic activity of the Rh(II) sites and it can be coupled to ligand&#8208;exchange reactions to precipitate the Rh&#8208;MOP catalyst, facilitating its recovery and reuse.







Abstract
The activity of catalytic nanoparticles is strongly dependent on their surface chemistry, which controls colloidal stability and substrate diffusion toward catalytic sites. In this work, we studied how the outer surface chemistry of nanostructured Rh(II)&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic cages or polyhedra (Rh&#8208;MOPs) impacts their performance in homogeneous catalysis. Specifically, through post&#8208;synthetic coordination of aliphatic imidazole ligands onto the exohedral Rh(II) axial sites of Rh&#8208;MOPs, we solubilized a cuboctahedral Rh&#8208;MOP in dichloromethane, thereby enabling its use as a homogeneous catalyst. We demonstrated that the presence of the coordinating ligand on the surface of the Rh&#8208;MOP does not hinder its catalytic activity in styrene aziridination and cyclopropanation reactions, thanks to the dynamic Rh&#8208;imidazole coordination bond. Finally, we used similar ligand exchange post&#8208;synthetic reactions to develop a ligand&#8208;mediated approach for precipitating the Rh&#8208;MOP catalyst, facilitating the recovery and reuse of Rh&#8208;MOPs as homogeneous catalysts.

         <title>Conformational and Substitution Effects on the Donor and Reducing Strength of Tin(II) Porphyrinogens</title>

This work presents the first study on the influence of meso&#8208;substituents on the electronic structure of a calix[4]pyrrolato complex. Expansion of NSD method from porphyrin chemistry provides insights on the ligand conformation of a calix[4]pyrrolato p&#8208;block complex. Experimental donor strength scaling methods and detailed bond analysis reveal subtle but significant substitution and conformational effects.







Abstract
Meso&#8208;octaalkylcalix[4]pyrrolates are a class of redox&#8208;active porphyrinogen ligands. They have been well established in d&#8208; and f&#8208;block chemistry for over three decades but have only recently been introduced as ligands for p&#8208;block elements. Here, we present a study on the influence of meso&#8208;substituents on the redox chemistry of calix[4]pyrrolato stannate(II) dianions [2R]2&#8722; (R=Me, Et). Expansion of the normal&#8208;mode structural decomposition (NSD) method, well known for porphyrin chemistry, provides insights into the ligand conformation of a calix[4]pyrrolato p&#8208;block complex. Combined with the results of spectroscopic donor scaling, electrochemical studies, and quantum mechanical bond analysis tools, subtle but significant substitution and conformational effects on the electronic structure are revealed. Exploiting this knowledge rationalizes the role of this class of tin(II) dianions to act as potent reducing agents, but can also be expanded for other central elements. Photoexcitation boosts this reactivity further, allowing for the reduction of even challenging chlorobenzene.

         <title>Constructing Dynamic Cross&#8208;Linking Networks as Durable Bifunctional Coating for Highly Stable Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 43, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bifunctional AT network coating on Zn anode has been constructed via the reversible dynamic cross&#8208;linking interactions, which not only acts as a solid isolation layer to hinder H2O&#8208;induced side reactions but also induces Zn2+ ion flux and lastingly suppresses the Zn dendrites. As a result, the symmetric cell can maintain a significantly prolonged cycle life of 1087&#8197;h at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
The serious dendrite growth and H2O&#8208;induced side reactions on the Zn electrode lead to a significant fading in the cycling performance, hindering the development of commercial applications of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). Herein, a novel bifunctional network coating of dynamically cross&#8208;linking sodium alginate with trehalose has been rationally constructed on the Zn anode (Zn@AT). Firstly, the AT coating possesses abundant zinophilic oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups, which are able to induce uniform Zn2+ ion flux. Secondly, the AT coating as a solid barrier can effectively inhibit H2O&#8208;induced side reactions by lowering the activity of H2O molecules. More specially, based on the dynamic cross&#8208;linking, AT network coating is endowed with self&#8208;healing capacity during cycling for durable battery operation. Consequentially, Zn@AT anodes in symmetric cells can cycle stably for 2787&#8197;h at 2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and even achieve a significantly long cycle performance of 1087&#8197;h at large charge/discharge depths of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the Zn@AT//MnO2 full cell shows excellent specific capacity of 175&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 400 cycles. This study lights an effective strategy to enhance the durability of Zn electrodes in AZIBs.

Computational investigations of mechanisms using DFT calculations for the addition of diorganosilyl&#8208;zinc reagents across the C&#8722;C triple bond of ynamides unveiled an original concerted antarafacial mechanism, compatible with the experimentally observed regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities.







Abstract
An original concerted antarafacial mechanism for the addition of diorganosilyl&#8208;zinc reagents across the C&#8722;C triple bond of ynamides is computationally investigated using DFT calculations. This concerted mechanism, leading to a trans&#8208;product in only one step, results in the formation of a Si&#8722;C and a Zn&#8722;C &#963;&#8208;bond on opposite sides of the &#960;&#8208;system. We demonstrate that the mechanism going through a &#951;2&#8208;vinyl intermediate and the proposal of a radical chain pathway are energetically unsustainable. The retained concerted antarafacial pathway is tested on experimental selectivities: the regioselectivity, in favor of the silyl &#946;&#8208;addition in ynamide, and stereoselectivity, which is cis&#8208; with (Me2PhSi)2Zn but trans&#8208; with [(Me3Si)3Si]2Zn, are well reproduced by DFT calculations. The regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity are discussed using the activation strain model and a chemical bonding analysis.

         <title>Unravelling the Role of Structural Factors in the Luminescence Properties of Persulfurated Benzenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 43, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work the relationship between structural and emissive properties of persulfurated benzenes is presented. The photophysical properties of this class of organic solid&#8208;state phosphorescent materials result dependent on the molecular conformations adopted in crystalline or amorphous phases.







Abstract
Room temperature phosphorescence rarely occurs from pure organic molecules, especially in the solid&#8208;state. A strategy for the design of highly emissive organic phosphors is still hard to predict, thus impeding the development of new functional materials with the desired optical properties. Herein, we analyze a family of alkyl and aryl&#8208;substituted persulfurated benzenes, the latter representing a class of organic solid&#8208;state triplet emitters able to show very high emission quantum yield at room temperature. In this work, we correlate structural parameters with the photophysical properties observed in different experimental conditions (diluted solution, crystalline and amorphous phase at RT and low temperature). Our results, corroborated by a detailed computational analysis, indicate a close relationship between the luminescence properties and i) the nature of the substituents on the persulfurated core, ii) the adopted conformations in the solid state, both in crystalline and amorphous phases. These factors contribute to characterize the lowest&#8208;energy lying excited&#8208;state, its deactivation pathways, the phosphorescence lifetime and quantum yield. These findings provide a useful roadmap for the development of highly performing purely organic solid&#8208;state emitters based on the persulfurated benzene platform.

         <title>A Macrocyclic Tweezers&#8208;Shaped Receptor for the Biomimetic Recognition of the Gal(&#945;1&#8208;3)Gal Disaccharide of the &#945;&#8208;Gal Antigen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 43, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural features of a macrocyclic receptor for axially substituted monosaccharides have been combined with those of a tweezers&#8208;shaped acylic receptor for all&#8208;equatorial disaccharides to generate a macrocyclic tweezers&#8208;like structure. The resulting structure features distinct recognition properties toward &#945;Gal and the Gal(&#945;1&#8208;3)Gal disaccharide of the &#945;&#8208;Gal antigen.







Abstract
The Gal(&#945;1&#8208;3)Gal is the terminal disaccharide unit of the &#945;&#8208;Gal epitope [Gal(&#945;1&#8208;3)Gal(&#946;1&#8208;4)GlcNAc], an exogenous antigenic determinant with several clinical implications, found in all non&#8208;primate mammals and in several dangerous pathogens, including certain protozoa and mycobacteria. Its absence in humans makes the &#945;&#8208;Gal epitope an interesting target for several infectious diseases. Here we present the development of a macrocyclic tweezers&#8208;shaped receptor, resulting from the combination of the structural features of two predecessors belonging to the family of diaminocarbazole receptors, which exhibits binding properties in the low millimolar range toward the Gal(&#945;1&#8208;3)Gal disaccharide of the &#945;&#8208;Gal antigen.

         <title>Fluorination/Dearomatization of C6F5 Groups: An FLP Route to an Electrophilic Borane and Non&#8208;Coordinating Anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 43, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrophilic fluorination and de&#8208;aromatization of C6F5 rings in boranes and borate derivatives is achieved using XeF2 in the presence of BF3 or Lewis acidic cations. Thus, the anions [FB(C6F7)3]&#8722;, [B(C6F7)4]&#8722;, and [(C6F7)3BC&#8801;NB(C6F7)3]&#8722;, and borane adducts (L)B(C6F7)3 (L=MeCN, OPEt3) are reported.







Abstract
B(C6F5)3 and the corresponding anion [B(C6F5)4]&#8722; are ubiquitous in main group and transition metal chemistry. Known derivatives are generally limited to the incorporation of electron donating substituents. Herein we describe electrophilic fluorination and dearomatization of such species using XeF2 in the presence of BF3 or Lewis acidic cations. In this fashion the anions [HB(C6F5)3]&#8722;, [B(C6F5)4]&#8722; and [(C6F5)3BC&#8801;NB(C6F5)3]&#8722;, are converted to [FB(C6F7)3]&#8722;, [B(C6F7)4]&#8722;, and [(C6F7)3BC&#8801;NB(C6F7)3]&#8722;, respectively. Similarly, the borane adducts (L)B(C6F7)3 (L=MeCN, OPEt3) are produced. These rare examples of electrophilic attack of electron deficient rings proceed as [XeF][BF4] acts as a frustrated Lewis pair effecting fluorination and dearomatization of C6F5 rings.

The Cover Feature highlights our finding that treatment of B(C6F5)3 adducts and related anions with XeF2 in the presence of BF3 or Lewis acidic cations affords the fluorination of arene rings to give the borane adducts (L)B(C6F7)3 (L = MeCN, OPEt3) and the anions [FB(C6F7)3]&#8722;, [B(C6F7)4]&#8722;, and [(C6F7)3BC&#8801;NB(C6F7)3]&#8722;. These fluorinations proceed as [XeF][BF4] acts as a frustrated Lewis pair, with an exceptionally strong electrophilic cation and a nucleophilic anion. These findings suggest a route to unprecedented boranes and weakly coordinating anions. More information can be found in the Research Article by Z.&#8208;W. Qu, D.&#8197;W. Stephan and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202401776).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 43, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature depicts the interaction of laser light (here, a red laser) with single&#8208;molecule magnets (here, a Fe10Ln10 ring) which can show altered magnetic behaviour after photoexcitation (as suggested by the perpendicular magnetic field lines). Detection of such phenomena should be performed on different timescales with a multitechnique approach. This allows the relative contributions of interactions of electronic and magnetic states to be elucidated. More information can be found in the Research Article by J. Braun, A.&#8197;K. Powell and A.&#8208;N. Unterreiner (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400977).

In this Cover Feature, the structure of the lead player 2 is depicted at the forefront. Strikingly, two supporting actors, [AgIII(CF3)3(C6H9N3)] (2&#8217;) and the AgIII&#8208;ONO2 complex 5, came on the scene in this production and are illustrated here on a second plane, yet illuminated by the two spotlights that allowed their neat identification.

         <title>Dead Lithium in Lithium Metal Batteries: Formation, Characterization and Strategies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 43, August 1, 2024. </description>

Dead lithium in lithium metal batteries plays a negative effect on battery life and capacity retention, however, interface and electrolyte engineering are believed to be effective routes to reduce and/or reuse the dead lithium, which can boost the practical use of lithium metal anode.







Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal anode (LMA) replacing graphite anode for developing Li metal batteries (LMB) with the higher energy density has attracted much attention. However, LMA faces many issues, e.&#8201;g., Li dendrites, dead Li and the side reactions, which causes the safety hazards and low coulomb efficiency (CE) of battery, therefore, LMB still cannot replace the current Li ion battery for practical use. Among those issues, dead Li is one of the decisive factors affecting the CE of LMB. To better understand dead Li, we summarize the recent work about the generation of dead Li, its impact on batteries performance, and the strategies to reuse and eliminate dead Li. Finally, the prospect of the future LMA and resultant LMB is also put forward.

         <title>Thermochromic Vanadium Dioxide Nanostructures for Smart Windows and Radiative Cooling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 43, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise summary was provided on the synthesis of VO2 nanostructures based on nanoparticles and thin films. The review covered modulation strategies for the optical properties of VO2, specifically highlighting doping, thermal processing, and structure manipulation to enhance and regulate the thermochromic and emissivity performance of VO2. Finally, representative works showcasing smart window and radiative cooling applications were introduced.







Abstract
The pursuit of energy&#8208;saving materials and technologies has garnered significant attention for their pivotal role in mitigating both energy consumption and carbon emissions. In particular, thermochromic windows in buildings offer energy&#8208;saving potential by adjusting the transmittance of solar irradiation in response to temperature changes. Radiative cooling (RC), radiating thermal heat from an object surface to the cold outer space, also offers a potential way for cooling without energy consumption. Accordingly, smart window and RC technologies based on thermochromic materials can play a crucial role in improving energy efficiency and reducing energy consumption in buildings in response to the surrounding temperature. Vanadium dioxide (VO2) is a promising thermochromic material for energy&#8208;saving smart windows and RC due to its reversible metal&#8208;to&#8208;insulator transition, accompanying large changes in its optical properties. This review provides a brief summary of synthesis methods of VO2 nanostructures based on nanoparticles and thin films. Moreover, this review emphasizes and summarizes modulation strategies focusing on doping, thermal processing, and structure manipulation to improve and regulate the thermochromic and emissivity performance of VO2 for smart window and RC applications. In last, the challenges and recent advances of VO2&#8208;based smart window and RC applications are briefly presented.

This review underscores possibilities and limitations in applications of continuous gene diversification systems for evolution of enzyme function by showcasing successful evolution campaigns.







Abstract
Directed evolution generates novel biomolecules with desired functions by iteratively diversifying the genetic sequence of wildtype biomolecules, relaying the genetic information to the molecule with function, and selecting the variants that progresses towards the properties of interest. While traditional directed evolution consumes significant labor and time for each step, continuous evolution seeks to automate all steps so directed evolution can proceed with minimum human intervention and dramatically shortened time. A major application of continuous evolution is the generation of novel enzymes, which catalyze reactions under conditions that are not favorable to their wildtype counterparts, or on altered substrates. The challenge to continuously evolve enzymes lies in automating sufficient, unbiased gene diversification, providing selection for a wide array of reaction types, and linking the genetic information to the phenotypic function. Over years of development, continuous evolution has accumulated versatile strategies to address these challenges, enabling its use as a general tool for enzyme engineering. As the capability of continuous evolution continues to expand, its impact will increase across various industries. In this review, we summarize the working mechanisms of recently developed continuous evolution strategies, discuss examples of their applications focusing on enzyme evolution, and point out their limitations and future directions.

         <title>Recent Advancements in Metal&#8208;Catalyst&#8208;Free Multicomponent Radical Sulfonylation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 43, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The radical sulfonylation of alkynes for producing vinyl sulfones has garnered considerable interest because of its mild conditions and high efficiency. Moreover, the association of metal&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free systems with multicomponent reactions (MCRs) offers an environmentally friendly pathway for efficiently constructing complex scaffolds from readily available partners. Hence, we provide a categorical overview based on the objects of radical sulfonylation of alkynes (hydrosulfonylation, carbosulfonylation, aminosulfonylation, oxysulfonylation, sulfosulfonylation, selenosulfonylation, and iodosulfonylation) under metal&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free multicomponent systems, along with interpretations of the reaction mechanisms.







Abstract
Vinyl sulfones are crucial building blocks in synthetic chemistry and core structural units of pharmaceutically active molecules, thus extensive investigations have been conducted on the construction of these skeletons. In contrast to the classical synthetic approaches, the radical sulfonylation of alkynes for producing vinyl sulfones has garnered considerable interest because of its mild conditions and high efficiency. Radical sulfonation of alkynes typically begins with the sulfonyl radical attacking the alkynes, followed by further functionalization. Moreover, the association of metal&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free systems with multicomponent reactions (MCRs) offers an environmentally friendly pathway for efficiently constructing complex scaffolds from readily available partners. However, there is no comprehensive review summarizing the advancements in metal&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free multicomponent radical sulfonylation of alkynes. Hence, we provide a categorical overview based on the objects of sulfonylation of alkynes (hydrosulfonylation, carbosulfonylation, aminosulfonylation, oxysulfonylation, sulfosulfonylation, selenosulfonylation, and iodosulfonylation), along with interpretations of the reaction mechanisms.

         <dc:description>
Photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition is a universal and straightforward pathway for carbocyclic or heterocyclic organic compounds. In this article, we highlight the most recent advances in visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated [2+2] photocycloaddition reactions of alkynes with focus on the reaction mechanism and the late&#8208;stage synthetic applications. Advances in obtaining cyclobutenes, azetines, and oxetene intermediates continue to be breakthroughs in this fascinating field of research.







Abstract
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated [2+2] photocycloaddition reaction can be considered an ideal solution due to its green and sustainable properties, and is one of the most efficient methods to synthesize four&#8208;membered ring motifs. Although research on the [2+2] photocycloaddition of alkynes is challenging because of the diminished reactivity of alkynes, and the more significant ring strain of the products, remarkable achievements have been made in this field. In this article, we highlight the recent advances in visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated [2+2] photocycloaddition reactions of alkynes, with focus on the reaction mechanism and the late&#8208;stage synthetic applications. Advances in obtaining cyclobutenes, azetines, and oxetene active intermediates continue to be breakthroughs in this fascinating field of research.

         <title>Porphyrin Atropisomerism as a Molecular Engineering Tool in Medicinal Chemistry, Molecular Recognition, Supramolecular Assembly, and Catalysis</title>

Porphyrin atropisomerism opens an entirely new toolbox, allowing for the precise design of a porphyrin's molecular shape. This review details how this phenomenon has been utilised across all fields of chemistry, focusing on molecular recognition, medicinal chemistry and catalysis.







Abstract
Porphyrin atropisomerism, which arises from restricted &#963;&#8208;bond rotation between the macrocycle and a sufficiently bulky substituent, was identified in 1969 by Gottwald and Ullman in 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(o&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)porphyrins. Henceforth, an entirely new field has emerged utilizing this transformative tool. This review strives to explain the consequences of atropisomerism in porphyrins, the methods which have been developed for their separation and analysis and present the diverse array of applications. Porphyrins alone possess intriguing properties and a structure which can be easily decorated and molded for a specific function. Therefore, atropisomerism serves as a transformative tool, making it possible to obtain even a specific molecular shape. Atropisomerism has been thoroughly exploited in catalysis and molecular recognition yet presents both challenges and opportunities in medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Macromolecular Nano&#8208;Assemblies for Enhancing the Effect of Oxygen&#8208;Dependent Photodynamic Therapy Against Hypoxic Tumors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 43, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discusses the recent progress achieved by macromolecular nano&#8208;assemblies (MNAs) in addressing the challenges encountered in the oxygen (O2)&#8208;dependent photodynamic therapy (PDT) against hypoxic tumors. The well&#8208;designed MNAs can relieve hypoxia, utilize hypoxia, or improve the utilization efficiency of singlet oxygen (1O2) by targeted PDT and the storage and reuse of 1O2, thereby enhancing the PDT effect.







Abstract
In oxygen (O2)&#8208;dependent photodynamic therapy (PDT), photosensitizers absorb light energy, which is then transferred to ambient O2 and subsequently generates cytotoxic singlet oxygen (1O2). Therefore, the availability of O2 and the utilization efficiency of generated 1O2 are two significant factors that influence the effectiveness of PDT. However, tumor microenvironments (TMEs) characterized by hypoxia and limited utilization efficiency of 1O2 resulting from its short half&#8208;life and short diffusion distance significantly restrict the applicability of PDT for hypoxic tumors. To address these challenges, numerous macromolecular nano&#8208;assemblies (MNAs) have been designed to relieve hypoxia, utilize hypoxia or enhance the utilization efficiency of 1O2. Herein, we provide a comprehensive review on recent advancements achieved with MNAs in enhancing the effectiveness of O2&#8208;dependent PDT against hypoxic tumors.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;sensitized CO2 Methanation along a Relaxed Heat Available Route</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In photocatalysis, the resulted heat by the relaxation of most of incident light no longer acts as the industrially favorite driving force back to the target photo&#8208;reaction due to more or less the negative relation between photocatalytic efficiency and temperature. Here, we reported a visible light&#8208;sensitized protocol that completely reversed the negatively temperature&#8208;dependent efficiency in photo&#8208;driven CO2 methanation with saturated water vapor. Uniform Pt/N&#8208;TiO2/PDI self&#8208;assembly material decisively injects the excited electron of PDI sensitizer into N&#8208;TiO2 forming Ti&#8208;H hydride which is crucially temperature&#8208;dependent nucleophilic species to dominate CO2 methanation, rather than conventionally separated and trapped electrons on the conductor band. Meanwhile, the ternary composite lifts itself temperature from room temperature to 305.2 &#176;C within 400s only by the failure excitation upon simulated sunlight of 2.5 W/cm2, and smoothly achieves CO2 methanation with a record number of 4.98 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 rate, compared to less than 0.02 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 at classic Pt/N&#8208;TiO2/UV photocatalysis without PDI sensitization. This approach can reuse ~53.9% of the relaxed heat energy from the incident light thereby allow high&#8208;intensity incident light as strong as possible within a flowing photo&#8208;reactor, opening the most likely gateways to industrialization.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Active Immobilized Catalyst for Ethylene Polymerization: Neutral Single Site Y(III) Complex Bearing Bulky Silylallyl Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring the surface organometallic chemistry on silica of highly electrophilic yttrium complexes is a relatively uncommon endeavor, particularly when focusing on tris&#8208;alkyl complexes characterized by Y&#8208;C &#963;&#8208;alkyl bonds. A drawback with this class of complexes once grafted on silica, is the frequent occurrence of alkyl transfer by ring opening of siloxane groups, resulting in a mixture of species. Herein, we employed a more stable homoleptic yttrium allyl complex bearing bulky &#951;3&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis(trimethylsilyl)allyl ligand to limit this transfer reaction. This strategy has been validated by comparing the reactivity between [Y{&#951;3&#8208;1,3&#8208;C3H3(SiMe3)2}3] and [Y(o&#8208;CH2PhNMe2)3] with SiO2&#8208;700, where the undesired alkyl transfer reaction occurred for [Y(o&#8208;CH2PhNMe2)3] leading to a bipodal [(&#8801;SiO)2Y(o&#8208;CH2PhNMe2)] as major surface species, 2, while [Y{&#951;3&#8208;1,3&#8208;C3H3(SiMe3)2}3] resulted selectively in a monopodal species, [(&#8801;SiO)Y{&#951;3&#8208;1,3&#8208;C3H3(SiMe3)2}2], 1. The materials obtained were characterized by DRIFT, solid state NMR, mass balance analysis and EXAFS. Catalyst 1 showed high activity compared to 2 in ethylene polymerization. The catalytic performance of this neutral catalyst 1 was extended to pre&#8208;industrial scale in the presence of hydrogen and 1&#8208;hexene. An unprecedented activity, up to 7400 gPE&#183;gcat&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 was obtained even with very low concentration of scavenger AliBu3 (TIBA/Y = 1.2). The obtained HDPE exhibited desired spherical particle morphology with broad molar mass distribution.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic&#8208;Structure Interpretation: How Much Do We Understand Ce L3 XANES?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article provides a brief overview of how Ce L3 XANES spectroscopy, especially in HERFD mode, can be utilized to investigate the electronic structure in cerium systems in a highly sophisticated manner. It addresses key questions relevant to chemists, material scientists and physicists, particularly regarding the oxidation state, ground&#8208;state configuration, electron occupation, and local structure near the Ce atom.







Abstract
Historically, cerium has been attractive for pharmaceutical and industrial applications. The cerium atom has the unique ability to cycle between two chemical states (Ce(III) and Ce(IV)) and drastically adjust its electronic configuration: [Xe] 4f15d16s2 in response to a chemical reaction. Understanding how electrons drive chemical reactions is an important topic. The most direct way of probing the chemical and electronic structure of materials is by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) or X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure (XANES) in high energy resolution fluorescence detection (HERFD) mode. Such measurements at the Ce L3 edge have the advantage of a high penetration depth, enabling in&#8208;situ reaction studies in a time&#8208;resolved manner and investigation of material production or material performance under specific conditions. But how much do we understand Ce L3 XANES? This article provides an overview of the information that can be extracted from experimental Ce L3 XAS/XANES/HERFD data. A collection of XANES data recorded on various cerium systems in HERFD mode is presented here together with detailed discussions on data analysis and the current status of spectral interpretation, including electronic structure calculations.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Hydrothermal&#8208;Derived rGO/MXene/Sulfur Composite Aerogels as Free&#8208;Standing Cathodes in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;pot hydrothermal strategy is developed to produce rGO/MXene/sulfur composite aerogels where sulfur is in&#8197;situ trapped in the 3D rGO/MXene conductive skeleton. The optimized composite aerogels as free&#8208;standing cathodes delivery a specific capacity of 951&#8197;mAhg&#8722;1 after 100 cycles at 0.2&#8197;C with a low fading rate of 0.062&#8201;% per cycle.







Abstract
The confinement and high utilization of sulfur in the cathodes is critical for improved cycling performance of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. In this case one&#8208;pot hydrothermal strategy is developed to produce rGO/MXene/sulfur composite aerogels where sulfur is in&#8197;situ trapped in the 3D rGO/MXene conductive skeleton. The optimized composite aerogels as free&#8208;standing cathodes delivery a specific capacity of 951&#8197;mAhg&#8722;1 after 100 cycles at 0.2&#8197;C with a low fading rate of 0.062&#8201;% per cycle. The excellent cycling performance is correlated with highly oxidized MXene and in&#8197;situ formed sulfate/thiosulfate complex layer in the long&#8208;term cycles.

         <title>A Simply Synthesized Shaking&#8208;induced Small Molecule System with Repeatable and Instantaneous Discoloration Response</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simply&#8208;synthesized small molecule solution system with repeatable and instantaneous force&#8208;related discoloration response (from yellowish to dark green) is attributed to accelerated generation of ortho&#8208;OH phenoxyl radical under shaking.







Abstract
Force&#8208;related discoloration materials are highly valuable because of their characteristics of visualization, easy operation, and environment friendliness. Most force&#8208;related discoloration materials focus on polymers and depend on bond scission, which leads to insensitivity and unrecoverable. Small&#8208;molecule systems based on well&#8208;defined molecular structures and simple composition with high sensitivity would exhibit considerable mechanochromic potential. However, to date, researches about force&#8208;related discoloration materials based on small molecule solution remain limited and are rarely reported. In this study, we developed a repeatable and instantaneous discoloration small molecule solution system by simple one&#8208;pot synthesis method. It exhibited an instantaneous chromic change from yellowish to dark green under shaking and reverting back to yellow within 1&#8197;minute after removal of the shaking. Experimental results confirmed that the discoloration mechanism is attributed to the oscillation accelerating the production of unstable ortho&#8208;OH phenoxyl radical. The newly developed shaking&#8208;induced discoloration small molecule system (SDSMS) promises in field of mechanical force sensing and optical encryption.

         <title>Facile Preparation and Study of Self&#8208;healing Water&#8208;absorbing Expanding Elastomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The absorbent expansion elastomer plays a crucial role in engineering sealing and holds a promising future in this field as infrastructure continues to develop. Traditional materials have their limitations, especially when used in large construction projects where the integrity and reliability of the material are of utmost importance. In this work, a self&#8208;healing water&#8208;absorbing expansion elastomer was developed for continuous production at a large scale to monitor the sealing conditions of massive infrastructure projects. At room temperature, the material exhibited a repairing efficiency of 57.77% within 2 h, which increased to 84.02% after 12 h. This extended reaction time allowed for effective repairs when defects were detected. The material's strength reached approximately 3 MPa, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. The volume expansion rate of the material reached 200&#8208;400% for effective sealing, and the fictionalization of the packing made it have a good external force sensing effect and prevent heat build&#8208;up effect. The conductive detection performance of the absorbent expansion elastomer was improved by utilizing triple self&#8208;healing strategies, including dipole&#8208;dipole interaction, ion cross&#8208;linked network, and externally&#8208;aided restoration materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfonamide&#8208;Sulfonimide Copolymers as Novel, Fluorine&#8208;Lean Type of Proton Exchange Membranes for Fuel Cell Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, a novel type of fluorine&#8208;lean proton exchange membranes is presented, using sulfonamide&#8208;sulfonimide functional groups for ion conduction. These groups are constructed on a polystyrene backbone for simple and cost&#8208;efficient usage as well as rapid scalability. The polymer is further tailored by adjusting the sulfonamide functionality with various end&#8208;groups, namely pentafluorophenyl, 4&#8208;fluorophenyl, butyl and octyl groups. These groups affect the pKa, leading to pKa values of 5.7 for the pentafluorophenyl substitution and pKa 10.5 for the alkyl chain. The glass transition temperature of the sulfonamide homopolymers can be reduced from Tg = 151&#176;C (Pentafluorophenyl) to 49&#176;C (Octyl), making the ionomer more flexible at room temperature. The combination of the non&#8208;swelling sulfonamide further mitigates the high water uptake of the sulfonimide while maintaining the nominal ion exchange capacity. This combination leads to extremely high proton conductivities with up to &#963; = 283 mS cm&#8208;1 at room temperature, which is clearly outperforming Nafion and approaches values for acid doped systems. This approach can pave the way to a novel type of ion conducting class in proton exchange membrane fuel cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Transient Photoactivation of Anionophores by Using Redshifted Fast&#8208;Relaxing Azobenzenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photo&#8208;regulated transmembrane ionophores enable spatial and temporal control over activity, offering promise as targeted therapeutics. Key to such applications is control using bio&#8208;compatible visible light. Herein, we report red&#8208;shifted azobenzene&#8208;derived synthetic anionophores that use amber or red light to trigger (E)&#8208;(Z) photoisomerisation and activation of transmembrane chloride transport. We demonstrate that by tuning the thermal half&#8208;life of the more active, but thermodynamically unstable, Z isomer to relax on the timescale of minutes, transient activation of ion transport can be achieved by activating with solely with visible light and deactivating by thermal relaxation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An adaptable Fe(II) tetrahedral cage, [Fe4L4][BF4]8 (L = tris(4&#8208;(((E)&#8208;pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethylene)amino)phenyl) phosphate), has been synthesised via self&#8208;assembly. By modulating the orientation of its pendant P=O groups, the cage was found to be capable of encapsulating anionic, neutral, and cationic guests, which was confirmed in the solid state via single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) and in solution by high&#8208;resolution mass spectroscopy (HR&#8208;MS), as well as by NMR (1H, 19F, 31P) studies where possible.</dc:description>

         <title>The Diversity and Evolution of Chiral Br&#248;nsted Acid Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The number and complexity of chiral Br&#248;nsted acids are dramatically increasing, ultimately leading to unique generations of catalysts with enhanced reaction capabilities. In this concept article, we discuss how the approach to optimizing these structures have transitioned from foundational structural tuning to a function&#8208;driven approach.







Abstract
The chemical space of chiral Br&#248;nsted acid catalysts is defined by quantity and complexity, reflecting the diverse synthetic challenges confronted and the innovative molecular designs introduced. Here, we detail how this successful outcome is a powerful demonstration of the benefits of utilizing both local structure searches and a comprehensive understanding of catalyst performance for effective and efficient exploration of Br&#248;nsted acid properties. In this concept article we provide an evolutionary overview of this field by summarizing the approaches to catalyst optimization, the resulting structures, and functions.

         <title>Hydrosilylation of Arynes with Silanes and Silicon&#8208;Based Polymer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various silanes as well as organosilicon polymer PHMS can react smoothly with HDDA&#8208;derived benzyne to give the arylation products. Lewis acid such as boron trifluoride etherate can accelerate these hydrosilylation reactions. Mechanism research showed that the hydrosililation reaction probably underwent a synergistic pathway.







Abstract
Benzyne derived from hexadehydrogenated Diels Alder (HDDA) reactions was found to be an efficient hydrosilylation acceptors. Various silanes can react smoothly with HDDA&#8208;derived benzyne to give the arylation products. Lewis acid such as boron trifluoride etherate can accelerate these hydrosilylation reactions. Polyhydromethylsiloxane (PHMS), a widely used organosilicon polymer, was also successfully modified using our method. About 5&#8201;% of Si&#8722;H bonds in the polymer were inserted by benzynes, giving a functional PHMS with much more solubility in methanol and with a blue&#8208;emitting fluorescence behavior. Mechanism research shows that the insertion of benzyne into the Si&#8722;H bond probably undergoes a synergistic pathway, which is quite different from the traditional radical&#8208;initiated hydrosilylation or transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation.

         <title>Pyridinethiolate&#8208;Capped CdSe Quantum Dots for Red&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven H2 Production in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper describes the first example of metal chalcogenide quantum dots that show the feasibility of harvesting red&#8208;light for H2 production. The noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free system lasts over 240&#8197;hour and realizes a turnover number of 43910. Triplet quantum yield of quantum dot is a key factor promoting the catalysis.







Abstract
The utilization of low&#8208;energy sunlight to produce renewable fuels is a subject of great interest. Here we report the first example of metal chalcogenide quantum dots (QDs) capped with a pyridinethiolate carboxylic acid (pyS&#8208;COOH) for red&#8208;light&#8208;driven H2 production in water. The precious&#8208;metal&#8208;free system is robust over 240&#8197;h, and achieves a turnover number (TON) of 43910&#177;305 (vs Ni) with a rate of 31570&#177;1690&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for hydrogen production. In contrast to the inactive QDs capped with other thiolate ligands, the CdSe&#8208;pyS&#8208;COOH QDs give a significantly higher singlet oxygen quantum yield [&#934;&#916; (1O2)] in solution.

         <title>Co(II) Macrocyclic Complexes with Amide&#8208;Glycinate Pendants as ParaCEST and Liposomal CEST Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocyclic Co(II) complexes with appended amide&#8208;glycinate groups are paramagnetic chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) agents with highly shifted and intense CEST peaks due, in part, to the trans&#8208;orientation about the amide C&#8722;N bond. These Co(II) paramagnetic shift agents have reduced overall charge for higher loading into liposomes for lipoCEST studies.







Abstract
Macrocyclic Co(II) complexes with appended amide&#8208;glycinate groups were prepared to develop paramagnetic Co(II) chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) agents of reduced overall charge. Complexes with reduced charge and lowered osmolarity are important for their loading into liposomes and to provide complexes that are highly water soluble and well tolerated in animals. Co(L1) has two non&#8208;coordinating benzyl groups and two amide&#8208;glycinate pendants, whereas Co(L2) has two unsubstituted amide pendants and two amide&#8208;glycinate pendants on cyclam (1,4,8,11&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane). The 1H NMR spectrum of Co(L1) is consistent with a single cis&#8208;pendant isomer with both amide protons in the trans&#8208;configuration, as supported by an X&#8208;ray crystal structure. Co(L2) has a mixture of different isomers in solution, including the trans&#8208;1,4 and 1,8 pendant isomers. The Z&#8208;spectrum of Co(L1) shows one highly&#8208;shifted CEST peak, whereas Co(L2) exhibits six CEST peaks. Encapsulation of 40&#8197;mM Co(L1) in a liposome with osmotically&#8208;induced shrinking at 300 mOsm/L produces a liposomal CEST agent with saturation frequency offset of 3&#8197;ppm. Addition of the amphiphilic 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane&#8208;based complex Co(L5) to the liposomal bilayer at 18&#8197;mM with Co(L1) encapsulated in the liposome at 50&#8197;mM changes the sign and increases the magnitude of the saturation frequency offset to &#8722;7.5&#8197;ppm at 300 mOsm/L.

         <title>Microwave&#8208;Assisted Ultrafast Synthesis of Bimetallic Nickel&#8208;Cobalt Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Application in the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>

MOFs are good precursors for active mixed&#8208;metal oxide/hydroxide electrocatalysts, with a uniform distribution of metals at the nanoscale. The catalytic properties of materials from monometallic Ni&#8208;, Co&#8208; and Zn&#8208;MOFs and bimetallic NiCo&#8208;, NiZn&#8208; and CoZn&#8208;MOFs with benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicarboxylate (BDC) and 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) are investigated in direct comparison. A MOF nanosheet was for the first time obtained on Ni foam through microwave&#8208;heating.







Abstract
Herein, a series of monometallic Ni&#8208;, Co&#8208; and Zn&#8208;MOFs and bimetallic NiCo&#8208;, NiZn&#8208; and CoZn&#8208;MOFs of formula M2(BDC)2DABCO and (M,M&#8217;)2(BDC)2DABCO, respectively, (M, M&#8217;=metal) with the same pillar and layer linkers 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) and benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicarboxylate (BDC) were prepared through a fast microwave&#8208;assisted thermal conversion synthesis method (MW) within only 12&#8197;min. In the bimetallic MOFs the ratio M:M&#8217; was 4&#8201;:&#8201;1. The mono&#8208; and bimetallic MOFs were selected to systematically explore the catalytic&#8208;activity of their derived metal oxide/hydroxides for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Among all tested bimetallic MOF&#8208;derived catalysts, the NiCoMOF exhibits superior catalytic activity for the OER with the lowest overpotentials of 301&#8197;mV and Tafel slopes of 42&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 on a rotating disk glassy carbon electrode (RD&#8208;GCE) in 1&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 KOH electrolyte at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. In addition, NiCoMOF was insitu grown in just 25&#8197;min by the MW synthesis on the surface of nickel foam (NF) with, for example, a mass loading of 16.6 mgMOF/gNF, where overpotentials of 313 and 328&#8197;mV at current densities of 50 and 300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively, were delivered and superior long&#8208;term stability for practical OER application. The low Tafel slope of 27&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, as well as a low reaction resistance from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement (Rfar=2 &#937;), confirm the excellent OER performance of this NiCoMOF/NF composite. During the electrocatalytic processes or even before upon KOH pre&#8208;treatment, the MOFs are transformed to the mixed&#8208;metal hydroxide phase &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;M(OH)2 which presents the active species in the reactions (turnover frequency TOF=0.252&#8197;s&#8722;1 at an overpotential of 320&#8197;mV). Compared to the TOF from &#946;&#8208;M(OH)2 (0.002&#8197;s&#8722;1), our study demonstrates that a bimetallic MOF improves the electrocatalytic performance of the derived catalyst by giving an intimate and uniform mixture of the involved metals at the nanoscale.

         <title>Disulfide Bonds as Functional Tethers in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review details the state of the art of MOF applications in which appended disulfide bonds play a critical role in the functions of the materials. The installation of the disulfide bonds in and on the MOFs is also highlighted, and the installation methods are assigned to one of three categories.







Abstract
The functionality of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is often encoded by specific chemical moieties found within these architectures. As such, new techniques to install increasingly more complex functionalities in MOFs are regularly being reported in the literature. One such functional group is the disulfide bond. The redox behavior of this covalent linkage renders MOFs responsive to stimuli, often under reducing conditions. Here, we review examples in which disulfide&#8208;containing MOFs are deployed in applications including drug delivery, therapeutic ferroptosis, exfoliation, energy storage, sensing, and others.

         <title>Rational Molecular Design of Diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;Based n&#8208;Type and Ambipolar Polymer Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advancements in molecular design strategies towards enhancing the n&#8208;type/ambipolar transporting properties of DPP&#8208;based polymer semiconductors have been thoroughly reviewed, especially focusing on copolymerization of DPP with different acceptors and weak donors, DPP flanked aromatic ring modification, DPP&#8208;core ring expansion and DPP dimerization.







Abstract
Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)&#8208;based polymer semiconductors have drawn great attention in the field of organic electronics due to the planar structure, decent solubilizing capability, and high crystallinity. However, the electron&#8208;deficient capacity of DPP derivatives are not strong enough, leading to relatively high&#8208;lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the corresponding polymers. As a result, n&#8208;type and ambipolar DPP&#8208;based polymers are rare and their electron mobilities also lag far behind the p&#8208;type counterparts, which limits the development of important p&#8208;n&#8208;junction&#8208;based electronic devices. Therefore, new design strategies have been proposed recent years to develop n&#8208;type/ambipolar DPP&#8208;based polymers with improved performances. In this view, these molecular design strategies are summarized, including copolymerization of DPP with different acceptors and weak donors, DPP flanked aromatic ring modification, DPP&#8208;core ring expansion and DPP dimerization. The relationship between the chemical structures and organic thin&#8208;film transistor performances is intensively discussed. Finally, a perspective on future trends in the molecular design of DPP&#8208;based n&#8208;type/ambipolar polymers is also proposed.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Catalyzed Olefination of Aryl Aldehydes Using Propiolates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Propiolates have been demonstrated as olefinating agents in the silver&#8208;catalyzed olefination of aryl and cinnamyl aldehydes to make &#945;,&#946;&#8208; and &#945;,&#946;,&#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated esters with excellent E&#8208;selectivity. Trimethyl orthoformate plays a dual role by generating nucleophilic allenolate from propiolate and more electrophilic oxocarbenium ion from aldehyde to effect the reaction.







Abstract
Olefination of aldehydes is one of the fundamental reactions in organic synthesis. The commonly used Wittig olefination reaction however uses stoichiometric quantities reagents under basic conditions resulting in stoichiometric amounts of byproducts. Known catalytic alternate to the Wittig reaction requires stoichiometric amounts of silane reducing agents and high temperature. Herein, we report a base&#8208;free olefination of aryl aldehydes using propiolates as a surrogate for the Witting reagent under silver catalysis. Trimethyl orthoformate, in the presence of a silver catalyst adds to the alkynoate to form the nucleophilic silver allenolate which reacts with the reactive oxocarbenium ion formed from aldehyde under the reaction conditions. Subsequently, decarbonylation occurs to form the olefin. Trans olefin is formed exclusively from simple aryl aldehydes and cinnamaldehydes. Such a silver allenolate is conceptually novel and has not been explored so far.

         <title>The Excited State Dynamics of a Mutagenic Guanosine Etheno Adduct Investigated by Femtosecond Fluorescence Spectroscopy and Quantum Mechanical Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mutagenic etheno adduct of guanine exhibits a peculiar behavior of its lowest singlet excited state. The two independent and short&#8208;lived emission bands revealed by femtosecond upconversion fluorescence are associated with two strongly coupled bright minima of different geometry. Overall, the presence of the extra etheno ring on guanine slows down the efficient relaxation pathways, which are essential for the DNA photostability.







Abstract
Femtosecond fluorescence upconversion experiments were combined with CASPT2 and time dependent DFT calculations to characterize the excited state dynamics of the mutagenic etheno adduct 1,N2&#8208;etheno&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyguanosine (&#1013;dG). This endogenously formed lesion is attracting great interest because of its ubiquity in human tissues and its highly mutagenic properties. The &#1013;dG fluorescence is strongly modified with respect to that of the canonical nucleoside dG, notably by an about 6&#8208;fold increase in fluorescence lifetime and quantum yield at neutral pH. In addition, femtosecond fluorescence upconversion experiments reveal the presence of two emission bands with maxima at 335&#8197;nm for the shorter&#8208;lived and 425&#8197;nm for the longer&#8208;lived. Quantum mechanical calculations rationalize these findings and provide absorption and fluorescence spectral shapes similar to the experimental ones. Two different bright minima are located on the potential energy surface of the lowest energy singlet excited state. One planar minimum, slightly more stable, is associated with the emission at 335&#8197;nm, whereas the other one, with a bent etheno ring, is associated with the red&#8208;shifted emission.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;promoted C(sp3)&#8208;H &#945;&#8208;Carbamoylation of Cyclic Ethers with Isocyanides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
C(sp3)&#8208;H carbamoylation of cyclic ethers has been achieved via a domino sequence of Hydrogen Atom Transfer/Radical Polar Crossover pathways, finally enabling the nucleophilic addition of isocyanides to oxocarbenium ions. The current method features mild reaction conditions to generate oxocarbenium ions from non&#8208;activated ethers, along with good substrate scope and functional group compatibility.







Abstract
A protocol exploiting isocyanides as carbamoylating agents for the &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H functionalization of cyclic ethers has been optimized via a combined visible light&#8208;driven hydrogen atom transfer/Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed approach. The isocyanide substrate scope revealed an exquisite functional group compatibility (18 examples, with yields up to 99&#8201;%). Both radical and polar trapping, kinetic isotopic effect and real&#8208;time NMR studies support the mechanistic hypothesis and provide insightful details for the design of new chemical processes involving the generation of oxocarbenium ions.

         <title>Bipyramidal Nanocrystals of Noble Metals: From Synthesis to Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Shape control has been a major theme of nanocrystal research in terms of synthesis, property tailoring, and optimization of performance in a variety of applications. Among the possible shapes, bipyramids are unique owing to their symmetry, planar defects, and exposed facets. In this article, we focus on the colloidal synthesis of noble&#8208;metal nanocrystals featuring a triangular bipyramidal shape, together with highlights of their properties and applications. We start with a brief discussion of the general classification and requirements for the nucleation and growth of bipyramidal nanocrystals, followed by specific aspects regarding the synthetic methods with a focus on the roles of reduction, etching, and capping, as well as controls of facet, size, aspect ratio, and corner truncation. In the end, we illustrate how these aspects affect the properties of bipyramidal nanocrystals for plasmonic and catalytic applications, together with future perspectives.</dc:description>

         <title>Neptunyl Pyrrophen Complexes: Exploring Schiff base chemistry with multidentate acyclic ligands and transuranics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>. We report the synthesis, structure, and characterization of two novel neptunyl complexes (NpO2L1 and NpO2L2) constructed from phenylene&#8208;substituted benzyl ester bis(pyrrole)phenylenediamine (named &#8220;pyrrophen&#8221;) ligands. In both cases, the neptunium center exists in the +6 oxidation state, . As our specific interest is in exploring the chemistry of neptunium compounds containing the linear neptunyl ion (NpO22+) through equatorially coordinating the metal by multidentate organic ligands, we have identified the differences that are likely to cause discrepancy between the two complexes by examining the ions and their coordinative environments through single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography, diffuse reflectance,, and Raman spectroscopy. This is the first time pyrrophen has been utilized in Np chemistry and demonstrates a new platform to study 5f electron participation and coordination.</dc:description>

We report the synthesis, structure, and characterization of two novel neptunyl complexes (NpO2L1 and NpO2L2) constructed from phenylene-substituted benzyl ester bis(pyrrole)phenylenediamine (named &#8220;pyrrophen&#8221;) ligands. In both cases, the neptunium center exists in the +6 oxidation state, . As our specific interest is in exploring the chemistry of neptunium compounds containing the linear neptunyl ion (NpO22+) through equatorially coordinating the metal by multidentate organic ligands, we have identified the differences that are likely to cause discrepancy between the two complexes by examining the ions and their coordinative environments through single-crystal X-ray crystallography, diffuse reflectance,, and Raman spectroscopy. This is the first time pyrrophen has been utilized in Np chemistry and demonstrates a new platform to study 5f electron participation and coordination.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Phosphorous and Nitrogen Dual&#8208;Doped Carbon as a Highly Efficient Electrocatalyst for Sodium&#8208;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium&#8208;oxygen batteries have been regarded as promising energy storage devices due to their low overpotential and high energy density. Its applications, however, still face formidable challenges due to the lack of understanding about the influence of electrocatalysts on the discharge products. Here, a phosphorous and nitrogen dual&#8208;doped carbon (PNDC) based cathode is synthesized to increase the electrocatalytic activity and to stabilize the NaO2 superoxide nanoparticle discharge products, leading to enhanced cycling stability when compared to the nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (NDC). The PNDC air cathode exhibits a low overpotential (0.36 V) and long cycling stability (120 cycles). The reversible formation/decomposition and stabilization of the NaO2 discharge products are clearly proven by in&#8208;situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and ex&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction. Based on the density functional theory calculation, the PNDC has much stronger adsorption energy (&#8208;2.85 eV) for NaO2 than that of NDC (&#8208;1.80 eV), which could efficiently stabilize the NaO2 discharge products.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding the &#960;&#8208;system of Fatty Acid&#8208;Anion Transporter Conjugates Modulates Their Mechanism of Proton Transport and Mitochondrial Uncoupling Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper we introduce a second phenyl substituent to the aryl urea scaffold and evaluate the proton transport mechanisms and mitochondrial uncoupling actions of these compounds against their monoarylated analogues. Notably, incorporation of meta&#8208; but not para&#8208;linked proximal rings enhanced proton transport and mitochondrial uncoupling actions in MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells, consistent with improved charge delocalisation by the urea anion binding group to produce membrane&#8208;permeable complexes.







Abstract
Mitochondrial uncoupling by small molecule protonophores is a promising strategy for developing novel anticancer agents. Recently, aryl urea substituted fatty acids (aryl ureas) were identified as a new class of protonophoric anticancer agents. To mediate proton transport these molecules self&#8208;assemble into membrane&#8208;permeable anionic dimers in which intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the carboxylate and aryl&#8208;urea anion receptor delocalise the negative charge across the aromatic &#960;&#8208;system. In this work, we extend the aromatic &#960;&#8208;system by introducing a second phenyl substituent to the aryl urea scaffold and compare the proton transport mechanisms and mitochondrial uncoupling actions of these compounds to their monoaryl analogues. It was found that incorporation of meta&#8208;linked phenyl substituents into the aryl urea scaffold enhanced proton transport in vesicles and demonstrated superior capacity to depolarise mitochondria, inhibit ATP production and reduce the viability of MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 breast cancer cells. In contrast, diphenyl ureas linked through a 1,4&#8208;distribution across the phenyl ring displayed diminished proton transport activity, despite both diphenyl urea isomers possessing similar binding affinities for carboxylates. Mechanistic studies suggest that inclusion of a second aryl ring changes the proton transport mechanism, presumably due to steric factors that impose higher energy penalties for dimer formation.

         <title>What determines the Lewis acidity of a bismuthane? Towards Bi&#8208;based FLPs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aiming at intramolecular frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) based on soft Lewis acidic bismuth centers, a phosphine function was combined with a dichloridobismuthane unit on a phenylene backbone utilizing a scrambling approach. The reaction between two equivalents of BiCl3 and (o&#8208;(Ph2P)C6H4)3Bi yielded (o&#8208;(Ph2P)C6H4)BiCl2(THF), the structure of which indicated Bi&#8230;P interactions and thus a pronounced Lewis acidity at the bismuth center that was confirmed by the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method. However, the system turned out to be insufficient to be utilized for FLP reactivity. Hence, the chloride ligands were exchanged by iodide and C2F5 substituents, respectively. Despite a lower electronegativity the iodide compound exhibits a shorter Bi&#8230;P contact, while the C2F5 substituents led to a further decrease of the Lewis acidity, despite their high group electronegativity. DFT calculations rationalized this by a quenching of the Lewis acidity inherent to the &#963;*(Bi&#8213;C) orbital by negative hyperconjugation from occupied p&#8208;orbitals at the F atoms. Furthermore, it turned out that the strength of the covalent Bi&#8208;X &#963;&#8208;bond is a more important factor than the charge at Bi in determining the energetic accessibility and thus Lewis acidity of the antibonding &#963;*(Bi&#8213;C) orbital.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Upon introducing bulky aromatic groups into benzodifuranone derivatives, crystals with unprecedented solid&#8208;state emission were obtained. A crystallographic analysis revealed that the emissive properties should most likely be attributed to the absence of stacking between the dye scaffolds.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The creation of complex hollow nanostructures with precise control over size and shape represents a great challenge in supramolecular soft materials. Here, we have further developed a bioinspired methodology for the formation of aqueous nanotubes of well&#8208;defined dimensions and pore coating through the self&#8208;assembly of amphiphiles that are chemically programmed with complementary nucleobases. These nanotubes are endowed with a hydrophobic lumen, whose diameter can be expanded as a function of the monomer length, in which apolar dyes can be efficiently encapsulated.</dc:description>

         <title>Sequential H/D Exchanges Resulting from Rollover&#8208;Cyclometallation during Photoirradiation of Rhodium(III) Complex in Methanol&#8208;d4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present the photoreaction of newly prepared bis(6,6&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine)(oxalato)rhodium(III) ([Rh(N^N)2(ox)]+) in CD3OD. Photoirradiation of this complex causes the dissociation of ox, followed by the formation of the unprecedented Rh(III) complex with Rh&#8211;H and Rh&#8211;C s bonds, [Rh(N^N)(C^N)(H)(CD3OD)]+ (C^N = [6,6&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine]&#8208;3&#8208;yl&#8208;&#954;C3,&#954;N1&#8242;). This hydride formation and cyclometallation spontaneously proceed owing to the conflict between the steric hindrance arising from the methyl groups of N^N and the driving force for the structural change due to [Rh(N^N)2]+ formation. Although [Rh(N^N)(C^N)(H)(CD3OD)]+ is initially converted to [Rh(N^N)2]+ by photoirradiation, it is immediately regenerated by the rollover cyclometallation of the [Rh(N^N)2]+ complex. [Rh(N^N)(C^N)(H)(CD3OD)]+ undergoes H/D exchange for the H atoms in the Rh&#8211;H bond and at the 3, 3&#8242;&#8208;positions of the N^N ligand during the photoirradiation. DFT calculations predict with reasonable certainty the spontaneous structural change of [Rh(N^N)2]+ to [Rh(N^N)(C^N)(H)(CD3OD)]+ and the subsequent photodriven Rh&#8211;C bond rupture leading to the formation of [Rh(N^N)2]+ accompanied by H/D exchange reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Advanced Synthesis, Structural Characterization, and Functional Applications of Precision Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the realm of biological macromolecules, entities such as nucleic acids and proteins are distinguished by their homochirality, consistently defined chain lengths, and integral sequence&#8208;dependent functionalities. Historically, these refined attributes have eluded traditional synthetic polymers, which often exhibit wide variabilities in chain lengths, limited batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch reproducibility, and stochastic monomer arrangements. Bridging this divide represents a pivotal challenge within the domain of polymer science&#8212;a challenge that the burgeoning discipline of precision polymer chemistry is poised to address. Recent advancements have yielded precision polymers that boast prescribed monomer sequences and narrow molecular weight distributions, heralding a new era for developing model systems to decipher structure&#8208;property correlations within functional polymers, analogous to those within biological matrices. This review discusses the innovative liquid&#8208;phase and solid&#8208;phase synthesis techniques for creating precision polymers and the advanced characterization tools essential for dissecting their structure and properties. We highlight potential applications in self&#8208;assembly, catalysis, data storage, imaging, and therapy, and provide insights into the future challenges and directions of precision polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Bisphosphonium Benzene Diimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incorporation of cationic groups onto electron&#8208;poor compounds is a viable strategy for achieving potent electron acceptors, as evidenced by reports of air&#8208;stable radical forms of large aromatic diimides such as naphthalene and perylene diimides. These ions have also been observed to exhibit anion&#8208;&#960; interaction tendencies of interest in molecular recognition applications. The benefits of phosphonium incorporation, however, have not yet been extended to the smallest benzene diimides. Here, we report that dibrominated pyromellitic diimide and mellophanic diimide both readily undergo substitution reactions with phosphine sources to yield bisphosphonium compounds. In the single crystalline form, these dications display anion&#8208;&#960; interactions and, in the case of mellophanic diimide, the stabilization of a bromide&#8208;water H&#8208;bonding ring pattern. The reaction of these dications with chemical reductants readily provides the singly and doubly reduced redox states, which were characterized by UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy and found to exhibit intense absorptions extending into the near&#8208;IR region. Taken together, this work demonstrates that phosphonium incorporation onto congested aromatic diimide scaffolds is synthetically viable and produces unusual electron&#8208;poor compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile Metal&#8208;Free Arylation of BODIPY and Bis(BF2) Chromophores by Using Arylazosulfones in a Sunflow System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>BODIPYs have a well&#8208;established role in biological sciences as chemosensors and versatile biological markers due to their chemical reactivity, which allows for fine&#8208;tuning of their photophysical characteristics. In this work, we combined the unique reactivity of arylazo sulfones with the advantages of a &#8220;sunflow&#8221; reactor to develop a fast, efficient, and versatile method for the photochemical arylation of BODIPYs and other chromophores. This approach resulted in red&#8208;shifted emitting fluorophores due to extended electronic delocalization at the 3&#8208; and 5&#8208;positions of the BODIPY core. This method represents an advantageous approach for BODIPY functionalization compared to existing strategies.</dc:description>

         <title>Is the E/Z Iminium Ratio a Good Enantioselectivity Predictor in Iminium Catalysis?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The article describes using mass spectrometry and ion mobility to determine the isomer ratio of organocatalyst iminium ions. These ions are involved in the enantioselective addition of nucleophiles to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes. The isomer ratio, referred to as the &#8242;enantioselective potential&#8242;, is then compared with two reactions to evaluate its ability to predict enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Developing new enantioselective reactions is an important part of chemical discovery but requires time and resources to test large arrays of potential reaction conditions. New techniques are required to analyse many different reactions quickly and efficiently. Mass spectrometry is a high&#8208;throughput method; when combined with ion&#8208;mobility spectrometry, this technique can monitor diastereomeric reaction intermediates and thus be a handle to study enantioselective reactions. Through this technique and others, it was noted before that in the organocatalytic 1,4&#8208;addition to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes, the abundance of initial diastereomeric intermediates correlates strongly to that of the final enantiomeric products. This work determines isomeric abundance for various catalysts and aldehydes and uses it to predict the enantiomeric excess of two control reactions. The prediction matches well for one reaction but does not predict the obtained results for the second. This finding confirms that the E/Z ratio of the iminium intermediates can be used as a predictor for some reactions, but the kinetics of the following steps can dramatically change the true enantioselectivity.

Mass spectrometry is a high-throughput method; when combined with ion-mobility spectrometry, this technique can monitor diastereomeric reaction intermediates and thus be a handle to study enantioselective reactions. Through this technique and others, it was noted before that in the organocatalytic 1,4-addition to &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated aldehydes, the abundance of initial diastereomeric intermediates correlates strongly to that of the final enantiomeric products. This work determines isomeric abundance for various catalysts and aldehydes and uses it to predict the enantiomeric excess of two control reactions.

         <title>Dioxygen Activation by Gold(I)&#8208;Distorted Porphyrin Dinuclear Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of dinuclear gold(I) porphyrin complexes that could activate dioxygen (O2) in polar protic solvents was synthesized and their reactivities were evaluated. The revealed mechanistic insights indicate the coordination of O2 to a gold center and the importance of hydrogen bonding of an NH proton in a porphyrin ligand.







Abstract
Interactions between gold&#8208;based materials and dioxygen (O2) have motivated researchers to understand reaction mechanisms for O2 activation by homo&#8208; and heterogeneous gold catalysts. In this work, gold(I) porphyrin dinuclear complexes were synthesized with a saddle&#8208;distorted porphyrin ligand. The gold(I) porphyrin complexes showed unprecedented O2 activation in the presence of protic solvents to form gold(III) tetradentate porphyrin complexes. Mechanistic insights into the O2 activation by the gold(I) center were elucidated by spectroscopic measurements and theoretical calculations, revealing that dissociation of halides on the gold(I) center by alcohol solvents and hydrogen bonding of an N&#8722;H proton in the distorted porphyrin with dioxygen played important roles in establishing the unique reactivities of gold(I) complexes.

&lt;p&gt;A series of dinuclear gold(I) porphyrin complexes that could activate dioxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in polar protic solvents was synthesized and their reactivities were evaluated. The revealed mechanistic insights indicate the coordination of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to a gold center and the importance of hydrogen bonding of an NH proton in a porphyrin ligand.

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of Sulfoxide&#8208;Functionalized N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Ruthenium Complexes: An Experimental and Computational Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diastereoselective synthesis: A new family of sulfoxide&#8208;functionalized NHCs was created by a simple oxidation protocol from thioether&#8208;NHC. Associated with Ru(p&#8208;cymene), these NHC&#8208;SO ligands allow the formation of a single diastereomer in the form of an enantiomeric couple. This interesting selectivity is discussed by means of DFT calculations and experiments.







Abstract
The synthesis of sulfoxide&#8208;functionalized NHC ligand precursors were carried out by direct and mild oxidation from corresponding thioether precursors with high selectivity. Using these salts, a series of cationic [Ru(II)(&#951;6&#8208;p&#8208;cymene)(NHC&#8208;SO)Cl]+ complexes were obtained in excellent yields by the classical Ag2O transmetallation route. NMR analyses suggested a chelate structure for the metal complexes, and X&#8208;ray diffractometry studies of complexes 4&#8201;b, 4&#8201;c, 4dBArF and 4&#8201;e unambiguously confirmed the preference for the bidentate (&#954;2&#8208;C,S) coordination mode of the NHC&#8208;SO ligands. Interestingly, only one diastereomer, in the form of an enantiomeric pair, was observed both in 1H NMR and in the solid state for the complexes. DFT calculations showed a possible intrinsic energy difference between the two pairs of diastereomer. The calculated energy barriers suggested that inversion of the sulfoxide is only plausible from the higher energy diastereomer together with bulky substituents. Inverting the configuration at the Ru center instead shows a lower and accessible activation barrier to provide the most stable diastereomer through thermodynamic control, consistent with the observation of a single species by 1H NMR as a pair of enantiomers. All these complexes catalyse the &#946;&#8208;alkylation of secondary alcohols. Complex 4dPF6 bearing an NHC&#8208;functionalised S&#8208;Ad group has been further studied with different primary and secondary alcohols as substrates, showing high reactivity and high to moderate &#946;&#8208;ol&#8208;selectivities.

         <title>A Comprehensive Review of Solar Photocatalysis &amp; Photothermal Catalysis for Hydrogen Production from Biomass: from Material Characteristics to Engineering Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes solar photo/photothermal catalysis (PPTC) H2 production from biomass to promote its engineering applications. It reviews design strategies and mechanisms for catalytic reforming. It presents the contribution of the reactor to H2 production performance and analyzes the effects of heat mass transfer and radiation. Finally, it concludes and outlooks PPTC for H2 production.







Abstract
Biomass photoreforming is a promising way of producing sustainable hydrogen thanks to the abundant sources of biomass feedstocks. Solar energy provides the heat and driven force to initial biomass oxidation coupled with H2 evolution. Currently, biomass photoreforming is still far from plant&#8208;scale applications due to the lower solar energy utilization efficiencies, the low H2 yield, and the lack of appropriate photoreactors. The production of H2 from photoreforming of native biomass and platform molecules was summarized and discussed with particular attention to the prospects of scaling up the catalysis technology for mass hydrogen production. The types of photoreforming, including photocatalysis and photothermal catalysis, were discussed, consequently considering the different requirements for photoreactors. We also reviewed the photoreactors that support biomass photoreforming. Numerical simulation methods were implemented for the solid&#8208;liquid two&#8208;phase flow and inter&#8208;particle radiative transfer involved in the reaction process. Developing concentrated photothermal catalytic flowed reactors is beneficial to scale&#8208;up catalytic hydrogen production from biomass.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ni&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective addition of aryl halides to aldehydes has been studied with cyanobis(oxazoline) as chiral ligands and Mn as reductant. Aryl and heteroaryl bromides react with phenyl aldehyde to produce dibenzyl alcohols in 16&#8211;99&#8201;% yields with 53&#8211;92&#8201;% ees. Morever, phenyl chloride with aryl, heteroaryl and alkyl aldehydes synthesize dibenzyl alcohols in high yields with moderate enantioselectivities.







Abstract
The Ni&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective addition reaction of aryl halides to aldehydes was studied with cyanobis(oxazoline) as chiral ligands and Mn as reductant. Aryl and heteroaryl bromides reacted with phenyl aldehyde at room temperature to produce dibenzyl alcohols in 16&#8211;99&#8201;% yields with 53&#8211;92&#8201;% ees. Moreover, the coupling of phenyl chloride with a variety of aryl, heteroaryl and alkyl aldehydes was demonstrated in the presence of cyanobis(oxazoline)/Ni(II) at 60&#8201;&#176;C in generally high yields with moderate enantioselectivities.

&lt;p&gt;The Ni-catalyzed enantioselective addition of aryl halides to aldehydes has been studied with cyanobis(oxazoline) as chiral ligands and Mn as reductant. Aryl and heteroaryl bromides react with phenyl aldehyde to produce dibenzyl alcohols in 16&#8211;99&#8201;% yields with 53&#8211;92&#8201;% ees. Morever, phenyl chloride with aryl, heteroaryl and alkyl aldehydes synthesize dibenzyl alcohols in high yields with moderate enantioselectivities.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ni-catalyzed enantioselective addition reaction of aryl halides to aldehydes was studied with cyanobis(oxazoline) as chiral ligands and Mn as reductant. Aryl and heteroaryl bromides reacted with phenyl aldehyde at room temperature to produce dibenzyl alcohols in 16&#8211;99&#8201;% yields with 53&#8211;92&#8201;% ees. Moreover, the coupling of phenyl chloride with a variety of aryl, heteroaryl and alkyl aldehydes was demonstrated in the presence of cyanobis(oxazoline)/Ni(II) at 60&#8201;&#176;C in generally high yields with moderate enantioselectivities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual pH and Ca2+&#8208;Responsive PEG&#8208;Modified Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Based Supramolecular Nanodrug Delivery System: Excellent Cargo Encapsulation and Minimal Drug Toxicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pillar[5]arene&#8208;based nano&#8208;drug carrier WP5&#8835;EV has been formed by host&#8208;guest assembly. The carrier shows excellent cargo encapsulation properties and effectively prolongs the half&#8208;life and bioavailability of the drug. Importantly, WP5&#8835;EV can minimize the toxicity of the drug and enhance the antitumor activity.







Abstract
Chemotherapy is one of the most employed strategies in clinical treatment of cancer. However, reducing medication adverse effects and improving the biological activity remains a significant issue for chemotherapy. We developed a pH and Ca2+&#8208;responsive pillar[5]arene&#8208;based supramolecular nanodrug delivery system (NDDS) WP5&#8835;EV@DOX to address the aforementioned challenges. The formation of this NDDS began with the spontaneous formation of supramolecular nanodrug carrier WP5&#8835;EV in water from PEG&#8208;modified pillar[5]arene and the bipyridilium salt derivative EV through simple host&#8208;guest interaction. Then the antitumor drug doxorubicin DOX was efficiently loaded with a high encapsulation rate of 84.6&#8201;%. Cytotoxicity results indicated that the constructed nanoplatform not only reduced DOX toxicity and side effects on normal cell (293T), but also significantly enhanced the antitumor activity on cancer cell (HepG2). Moreover, in&#8197;vivo experiments showed that WP5&#8835;EV@DOX had a longer half&#8208;life and higher bioavailability in the blood of mice compared to the nake drug DOX, with increases to 212&#8201;% and 179&#8201;%, respectively. Therefore, WP5&#8835;EV@DOX has great potential in tumor therapy and provides a new idea for host&#8208;guest drug delivery system.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Promoted on&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Polyboroxine Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The on&#8208;surface formation of a novel B&#8722;O&#8722;B bond is promoted by oxygen atoms on the Au(111) surface upon breaking of the B&#8722;C bond in tri&#8208;naphthyl boroxine molecules. As a result, the synthesis of polyboroxine species is obtained and monitored by X&#8208;ray core spectroscopy.







Abstract
We present a protocol for the on&#8208;surface synthesis of polyboroxine molecules derived from boroxine molecules precursors. This process is promoted by oxygen species present on the Au(111) surface: oxygen atoms facilitate the detachment of naphthalene units of trinaphthyl&#8208;boroxine molecules and bridge two unsaturated boroxine centers to form a boroxine&#8208;O&#8208;boroxine chemical motif. X&#8208;ray spectroscopic characterization shows that, as the synthesis process proceeds, it progressively tunes the electronic properties of the interface, thus providing a promising route to control the electron level alignment.

         <title>Semisynthetic Glycoconjugates as Potential Vaccine Candidates Against Haemophilus influenzae Type a</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of the protein conjugates of Haemophilus influenzae type a (Hia) capsular polysaccharide oligomers is reported. The obtained neoglycoconjugates, comprising from one to five well&#8208;defined disaccharide repeating units, were employed in immunization studies, showing their ability to induce a specific immune response.







Abstract
Glycoconjugate vaccines are based on chemical conjugation of pathogen&#8208;associated carbohydrates with immunogenic carrier proteins and are considered a very cost&#8208;effective way to prevent infections. Most of the licensed glycoconjugate vaccines are composed of saccharide antigens extracted from bacterial sources. However, synthetic oligosaccharide antigens have become a promising alternative to natural polysaccharides with the advantage of being well&#8208;defined structures providing homogeneous conjugates. Haemophilus influenzae (Hi) is responsible for a number of severe diseases. In recent years, an increasing rate of invasive infections caused by Hi serotype a (Hia) raised some concern, because no vaccine targeting Hia is currently available. The capsular polysaccharide (CPS) of Hia is constituted by phosphodiester&#8208;linked 4&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucose&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;d&#8208;ribitol&#8208;5&#8208;(PO4&#8594;) repeating units and is the antigen for protein&#8208;conjugated polysaccharide vaccines. To investigate the antigenic potential of the CPS from Hia, we synthesized related saccharide fragments containing up to five repeating units. Following the synthetic optimization of the needed disaccharide building blocks, they were assembled using the phosphoramidite approach for the installation of the phosphodiester linkages. The resulting CPS&#8208;based Hia oligomers were conjugated to CRM197 carrier protein and evaluated in&#8197;vivo for their immunogenic potential, showing that all glycoconjugates were capable of raising antibodies recognizing Hia synthetic fragments.

         <title>Ring Rearrangement Reactions of 4&#8208;Alkenylisocoumarins and Photophysical Evaluation of Multi&#8208;Substituted Anthracene Products</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several &#960;&#8208;extended homophthalates have been synthesised by novel ring&#8208;opening/ring&#8208;closing cascade reaction of lactol silyl ethers bearing acrylate moiety. Thus obtained homophthalates can be used as effective C4 building blocks for polycyclic aromatic systems.







Abstract
Herein we report that readily available 4&#8208;alkenylisocoumarins can be regarded as potent dienolate equivalents. For example, lactol silyl ethers derived from 4&#8208;alkenylisocoumarins were selectively converted to the corresponding benzo&#8208;homophthalates through a fluoride&#8208;induced ring opening step that was followed by a ring closure through a vinylogous intramolecular aldol condensation. Likewise, nucleophilic activation of 4&#8208;alkenylisocoumarins directly yields diversely poly&#8208;substituted naphthalenes and anthracenes without formation of any regioisomer. Photophysical evaluation of a set of thus obtained 1,3&#8208;di&#8208; and 1,3,4&#8208;trisubstituted anthracenes reveals their distinct intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) character during light absorption in polar solutions and excimer emission from the solid state when a face&#8208;to&#8208;face &#960;&#8208;stacked molecular assembly is present in the crystal packing.

         <title>Modulating Helix&#8208;Preference of an Axially&#8208;Twisted Molecular Scaffold Through Diastereomeric Salt Formation with Tartaric Acid Stereoisomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral, axially&#8208;twisted molecular scaffold (ATMS) undergoes subtle differences in the stereochemical orientations on enantioselective interaction with stereoisomers of tartaric acid (TA), generating diverse spectroscopic outcomes to permit naked&#8208;eye enantio&#8208;discrimination.







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;A chiral, axially-twisted molecular scaffold (ATMS) undergoes subtle differences in the stereochemical orientations on enantioselective interaction with stereoisomers of tartaric acid (TA), generating diverse spectroscopic outcomes to permit naked-eye enantio-discrimination.

         <title>Chromium Complexes with Benzanellated N&#8208;Heterocyclic Phosphenium Ligands&#8211;Synthesis, Reactivity and Application in Catalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzanellation of the N&#8208;heterocyclic phosphenium (NHP) ligands in chromium complexes has impact on their reactivity, facilitating reduction to a radical anion, hydrogenation to a &#963;&#8208;H2&#8208;complex, and Cr&#8208;to&#8208;P hydride mobility in a NHP&#8208;phosphine&#8208;hydride&#8208;complex formed by isomerization of the H2&#8208;complex. The latter reduces CO2 with formation of a formato complex, which is a key to mediate the transfer hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol with NH3BH3.







Abstract
A chromium complex carrying two benzanellated N&#8208;heterocyclic phosphenium (bzNHP) ligands was prepared by a salt metathesis approach. Spectroscopic studies suggest that the anellation enhances the &#960;&#8208;acceptor ability of the NHP&#8208;units, which is confirmed by the facile electrochemical reduction of the complex to a spectroscopically characterized radical anion. Co&#8208;photolysis with H2 allowed extensive conversion into a &#963;&#8208;H2&#8208;complex, which shows a diverse reactivity towards donors and isomerizes under H&#8722;H bond fission and shift of a hydride to a P&#8208;ligand. The product carrying phosphenium, phosphine and hydride ligands was also synthesized independently and reacts reversibly with CO and MeCN to yield bis&#8208;phosphine complexes under concomitant Cr&#8208;to&#8208;P&#8208;shift of a hydride. In contrast, CO2 was not only bound but reduced to give an isolable formato complex, which reacted with ammonia borane under partial recovery of the metal hydride and production of formate. Further elaboration of the reactions of the chromium complexes with CO2 and NH3BH3 allowed to demonstrate the feasibility of a Cr&#8208;catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol. The various complexes described were characterized spectroscopically and in several cases by XRD studies. Further insights in reactivity patterns were provided through (spectro)electrochemical studies and DFT calculations.

         <title>Pegylated Phosphine Ligands in Iridium(I) Catalyzed Hydrogen Isotope Exchange Reactions in Aqueous Buffers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pegylated phosphine as water&#8208;soluble ligand in iridium(i) catalyzed hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) reactions. The new catalyst was studied in HIE reactions in buffers and protic solvents. We found that solvent and pH had a strong impact on the two occurring HIE processes.







Abstract
The synthesis of a water&#8208;soluble, phosphine&#8208;pegylated iridium(I) catalyst and its application in hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) reactions in buffer is reported. The longer polyethylene glycol side chains on the phosphine increased the water solubility independently from the pH. HIE reactions of polar substrates in protic solvents were studied. DFT calculations gave further insights into the catalytic processes. The scope and limitation of the pegylated catalyst was studied in HIE reactions of several complex compounds in borax buffer at pH&#8197;9 and the best conditions were applied in a tritium experiment with the drug telmisartan.

         <title>Multi Stimuli Responsive Dual Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission and Photochromic Behavior of a Tetraphenyl Substituted Triphenylamine Derivative and its Application as Anti&#8208;counterfeiting Agent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twisted polyaromatic luminescent systems are well known for their AIE behavior and this AIE feature is exploited for a wide variety of applications. In this work, a new tetraphenyl substituted triphenylamine moiety is coupled with spiropyran and the final compound furnished both photochromism, acidochromism, and AIE behavior which was used to afford anti&#8208;counterfeiting ink for versatile response under different wavelength of light.







Abstract
A multi&#8208;stimuli responsive tetraphenyl substituted tripehnylamine&#8208;based aggregation induced emissive (AIE) material coupled with spiropyran was prepared. Owing to the presence of AIE and photochromic moiety, the molecule exhibits emissive aggregates, photochromism, and acidochromism. The multiple stimuli sensitive behavior of the molecule was explored for anti&#8208;counterfeiting behavior on TLC plate and commercial banknotes. The fluorogenic and photogenic response under UV and visible light established the potential of the candidate as a new generation encryption material.

         <title>A Prebiotic Pathway to Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemical activation is the key in the prebiotic synthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide: NAD+ is obtained under prebiotic conditions by formation of nicotinamide riboside from ammonia, cyanoacetaldehyde, prop&#8208;2&#8208;ynal, glycol aldehyde and glyceraldehyde. Regioselective phosphorylation and use of light activated AMP yields NAD+ in a continuous formation process.







Abstract
Enzymes play a fundamental role in cellular metabolism. A wide range of enzymes require the presence of complementary coenzymes and cofactors to function properly. While coenzymes are believed to have been part of the last universal ancestor (LUCA) or have been present even earlier, the syntheses of crucial coenzymes like the redox&#8208;active coenzymes flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) remain challenging. Here, we present a pathway to NAD+ under prebiotic conditions starting with ammonia, cyanoacetaldehyde, prop&#8208;2&#8208;ynal and sugar&#8208;forming precursors, yielding in&#8197;situ the nicotinamide riboside. Regioselective phosphorylation and water stable light activated adenosine monophosphate derivatives allow for topographically and irradiation&#8208;controlled formation of NAD+. Our findings indicate that NAD+, a coenzyme vital to life, can be formed non&#8208;enzymatically from simple organic feedstock molecules via photocatalytic activation under prebiotically plausible early Earth conditions in a continuous process under aqueous conditions.

         <title>The Journey for the Synthesis of Large Acenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acenes, the group of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with linearly fused benzene rings, possess distinctive electronic properties with potential applicability in material science. Hexacene was the largest acene obtained and characterized in the last century, followed by heptacene in 2006. Since then, a race for obtaining the largest acene resulted in the development of several members of this family as well as diverse innovative synthetic strategies, from solid&#8208;state chemistry to the promising on&#8208;surface chemistry. This last technique allows the obtention of higher acenes, up to tridecacene, the largest acene so far. This review presents the different methodologies employed for the synthesis of acenes, highlighting the newest studies, to provide a much more thorough understanding of the essence of the electronic structure of this captivating group of organic compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Why Are Some Pnictogen(III) Pincer Complexes Planar and Others Pyramidal?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Geometrically&#8208;constrained pnictogen pincer complexes have emerged in recent years as platforms for unique stoichiometric and catalytic chemical transformations. These complexes feature dynamic conformations ranging from fully planar at the pnictogen centre to distorted&#8208;pyramidal geometries, as well as variation between phases. Although the valued reactivity of pnictogen pincer complexes is ascribed to their geometries, there is no unified model to explain the observed conformational outcomes across different ligands and pnictogen centres. Here we propose such a model through computational analysis of more than 1300 structures across 64 complexes (16 ligands and 4 heavy pnictogens), explaining the experimental observations and making new predictions. By looking at signatures of bond stability (bond lengths, Wiberg bond indices) and delocalization (NPA charges, Hirshfeld charges), our framework posits a pnictogen&#8208;based &#963;&#8208;bonding effect that favours pyramidalization and exists in competition with a ligand&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;bonding effect that favours planarity. Variations in structure as a function of pnictogen identity, ligand tethering, electronics, and aromaticity can be reconciled with reference to a balance between these two opposing forces. Careful consideration of the &#963;/&#960;&#8208;bonding effects may aid in the rational design of future pnictogen pincer complexes with predictable geometries and reactivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Predictive Modelling and Natural Product&#8208;based Divergent Synthesis &#8211; Design of Type B PPAPs with Nanomolar Activities against MRSA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In response to antibiotic resistance, a late&#8208;stage divergent synthesis approach was used to synthesize 30 new type B PPAPs for SAR studies against MRSA. AI&#8208;trained 3D&#8208;QSAR models based on cellular assay data, were used to screen a virtual compound, and the 20 most promising candidates were synthesized. Significant anti&#8208;MRSA activity at nanomolar concentration was demonstrated by these novel PPAPs.







Abstract
In response to the pressing global challenge of antibiotic resistance, time efficient design and synthesis of novel antibiotics are of immense need. Polycyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinols (PPAP) were previously reported to effectively combat a range of gram&#8208;positive bacteria. Although the exact mode of action is still not clear, we conceptualized a late&#8208;stage divergent synthesis approach to expand our natural product&#8208;based PPAP library by 30 additional entities to perform SAR studies against methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Although at this point only data from cellular assays are available and understanding of molecular drug&#8208;target interactions are lacking, the experimental data were used to generate 3D&#8208;QSAR models via an artificial intelligence training and to identify a common pharmacophore model. The experimentally validated QSAR model enabled the estimation of anti&#8208;MRSA activities of a virtual compound library consisting of more than 100,000 in&#8208;silico generated B PPAPs, out of which the 20 most promising candidates were synthesized. These novel PPAPs revealed significantly improved cellular activities against MRSA with growth inhibition down to concentrations less than 1&#8197;&#956;m.

         <title>A Schottky/Z&#8208;Scheme Hybrid for Augmented Photocatalytic H2 and H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The MCNRBO Schottky/Z&#8208;scheme ternary hybrid possessing shortened charge transfer resistance along with improved separation efficiency and abundant charged species demonstrated stupendous photocatalytic H2 and H2O2 production.







Abstract
The prodigious employment of fossil fuels to conquer the global energy demand is becoming a dreadful threat to the human society. This predicament is appealing for a potent photocatalyst that can generate alternate energy sources via solar to chemical energy conversion. With this interest, we have fabricated a ternary heterostructure of Ti3C2 nanosheet modified g&#8208;C3N4/Bi2O3 (MCNRBO) Z&#8208;scheme photocatalyst through self&#8208;assembly process. The morphological analysis clearly evidenced the close interfacial interaction between g&#8208;C3N4 nanorod, Bi2O3 and Ti3C2 nanosheets. The oxygen vacancy created on Bi2O3 surface, as suggested by XPS and EPR analysis, supported the Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction formation between g&#8208;C3N4 nanorod and Bi2O3 nanosheets. The collaborative effect of Z&#8208;scheme and Schottky junction significantly reduced charge transfer resistance promoting separation efficiency of excitons as indicated from PL and EIS analysis. The potential of MCNRBO towards photocatalytic application was investigated by H2O2 and H2 evolution reaction. A superior photocatalytic H2O2 and H2 production rate for MCNRBO is observed, which are respectively around 5 and 18 folds higher as compared to pristine CNR nanorod. The present work encourages for the development of a noble, eco&#8208;benign and immensely efficient dual heterojunction based photocatalyst, which can acts as saviour of human society from energy crisis.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Intramolecular Hydroalkoxylation of Allenes and Application in the Total Synthesis of (R,R,R)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Tocopherol</title>

         <dc:description>
The rhodium/Me&#8208;ferrocelane&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric intramolecular hydroalkoxylation of allenyl alcohols is reported. It provides selective access to 5&#8208;, 6&#8208; and 7&#8208;membered cyclic allyl ethers, scaffolds found in a large variety of pharmaceutical interesting and bioactive (natural) products. The gram scale preparation and functionalizations of the thus obtained product were demonstrated. Finally, we applied our novel method in a 2nd generation total synthesis of (R,R,R)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;tocopherol improving the overall efficiency significantly (9 steps in total and 38&#8201;% yield for chiral chromane building block).







Abstract
We report herein of a novel, enantioselective and rhodium&#8208; catalyzed cyclisation of allenyl alcohols towards chiral &#945;&#8208;vinylic, cyclic ethers employing a rhodium/(R,R)&#8208;Me&#8208;ferrocelane catalyst. The corresponding chiral cyclic products were obtained in general high yields and enantioselectivities. The synthetic value of our obtained products was further exemplified by transformations of the allylic ether function. Furthermore, applying our newly developed method in our previously reported route towards the total synthesis of (R,R,R)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;tocopherol, we accomplished a significantly improved 2nd generation synthesis of the chromane building providing a total number of 13 steps and an overall total yield of 27&#8201;%.

The gram scale preparation and functionalizations of the thus obtained product were demonstrated. Finally, we applied our novel method in a 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; generation total synthesis of (&lt;i&gt;R,R,R&lt;/i&gt;)-&#945;-tocopherol improving the overall efficiency significantly (9 steps in total and 38&#8201;% yield for chiral chromane building block).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report herein of a novel, enantioselective and rhodium- catalyzed cyclisation of allenyl alcohols towards chiral &#945;-vinylic, cyclic ethers employing a rhodium/(&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-Me-ferrocelane catalyst. The corresponding chiral cyclic products were obtained in general high yields and enantioselectivities. The synthetic value of our obtained products was further exemplified by transformations of the allylic ether function. Furthermore, applying our newly developed method in our previously reported route towards the total synthesis of (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-&#945;-tocopherol, we accomplished a significantly improved 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; generation synthesis of the chromane building providing a total number of 13 steps and an overall total yield of 27&#8201;%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unveiling the Reactivity of Part Per Million Levels of Cobalt&#8208;Salen Complexes in Hydrosilylation of Ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient strategy is developed for the synthesis of organosilicon compounds and corresponding secondary alcohols through the hydrosilylation of ketones utilizing ppm levels of inexpensive Cobalt&#8208;Salen complex. The developed reaction protocol features a broad substrate scope coupled with good selectivity, excellent turnover number (up to 2,00,000), applicability in gram scale synthesis and mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
A series of air&#8208;stable cobalt(III)salen complexes Co&#8208;1 to Co&#8208;4 have been synthesized and employed in the hydrosilylation of ketones. Notably, the most intricately tailored Co&#8208;3 pre&#8208;catalyst exhibited exceptional catalytic activity under mild reaction conditions. The developed catalytic hydrosilylation protocol proceeded with an unusual ppm level (5&#8197;ppm) catalyst loading of Co&#8208;3 and achieved a maximum turnover number (TON) of 200,000. A wide variety of aromatic, aliphatic, and heterocyclic ketones encompassing both electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents were successfully transformed into the desired silyl ethers or secondary alcohols in moderate to excellent yields.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boron difluoride (BF2) complexes with asymmetrical N,N&#8217;&#8208;bidentate ligands have demonstrated fascinating properties and found broad applications in various fields. They are generally constructed in two steps: ligand formation, followed by boron complexation. Herein, we categorize BF2 complexes based on the key synthetic strategies that have been applied in the ligand formation steps.

         <title>Redox Active Ligands for Catalyzing the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single reduction of boron subphthalocyanines and antimony corroles is sufficient for the conversion of protons to hydrogen in a catalytic process that involves only the macrocyclic ligands in the redox events. The proton&#8208;activation step involves the peripheral N and meso&#8208;C atoms of the former and latter complexes, respectively.







Abstract
Boron subphthalocyanines with chloride and fluoride axial ligands and three antimony complexes chelated by corroles that differ in size and electron&#8208;richness were examined as electrocatalysts for reduction of protons to hydrogen. Experiment&#8208; and computation&#8208;based investigations revealed that all redox events are ligand&#8208;centered and that the meso&#8208;C of the corroles and the peripheral N atoms of the subphthalocyanines are the largely preferred proton&#8208;binding sites.

         <title>Pyridyl&#8208;Substituted Nitronyl Nitroxides: Comprehensive Magnetochemical and Quantum Chemical Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of stable pyridyl&#8208;substituted nitronyl nitroxides was synthesized. Magneto&#8208;structural correlations were established by XRD, magnetochemistry and quantum chemical calculations. Low&#8208;temperature XRD revealed phase transitions.







Abstract
A series of pyridyl&#8208;substituted nitronyl nitroxides was synthesized and structurally characterized. A comprehensive magnetochemical and quantum chemical study of extended raw of the nitroxides with different substituents R in the pyridine fragment was performed. It was shown, that temperature&#8208;dependent magnetic properties are determined by the short contacts between nitroxide groups of adjacent molecules as well as between nitroxide group and methyl substituents in the pseudo axial positions of imidazoline fragments. Quantum chemistry allows to select the appropriate model of exchange cluster for analysis of experimental magnetic data and evaluation of the exchange interaction parameters. For NN&#8211;PyCl the &#8220;order&#8208;disorder&#8221; transition was detected by means of low temperature XRD. The difference in the experimental and calculated exchange interaction energies may serve as an indicator of temperature&#8208;induced structural rearrangements. For instance, for methyl substituted nitronyl nitroxide NN&#8208;PyMe structural transformations and significant changes in exchange interaction energies were observed.

         <title>Magnon Sensing of NO, NO2 and NH3 Gas Capture on CrSBr Monolayer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Br vacancies in the surface of CrSBr allow the capture of NO, NO2, and NH3. The adsorption of these harmful gas species induces a frequency shift in the magnon spectra, which makes the 2D van der Waals ferromagnet CrSBr a candidate material for molecular sensors based on magnon sensing as an alternative to conventional electronic gas sensors.







Abstract
Air pollution and greenhouse emissions are significant problems across various sectors, urging the need for advanced technologies to detect and capture harmful gases. In recent years, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials have attracted increasing attention due to their large surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio and reactivity. Herein, we investigate the potential of single&#8208;layer CrSBr for gas sensing and capturing by means of first&#8208;principles calculations. We explore the adsorption behaviour of different pollutant gases (H2S, NH3, NO, NO2, CO and CO2) on this 2D ferromagnet and the impact of intrinsic defects on its magnetic properties. Interestingly, we find that Br vacancies enhance the adsorption of NH3, NO and NO2 and induce a selective frequency shift on the magnon dispersion. This work motivates the creation of novel magnonic gas sensing devices based on 2D van der Waals magnetic materials.

         <title>Structural Flexibility is a Decisive Factor in FLP Dihydrogen Cleavage with Tetrahedral Lewis Acids: A Silane Case Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Why is dihydrogen activation with frustrated Lewis pairs based on tetrahedral Lewis acids that intricate? This study answers the question by means of a statistical analysis of an ensemble of &lt;1500 encounter complexes. It reveals that the formation of &#8220;active&#8221; EC is far less likely for tetrahedral Lewis acids compared to trigonal Lewis acids, slowing down dihydrogen splitting despite similar transition state energies.







Abstract
Dihydrogen activation is the paradigmatic reaction of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs). While trigonal&#8208;planar Lewis acids have been well established in this transformation, tetrahedral Lewis acids are surprisingly limited. Indeed, several cases were computed as thermodynamically and kinetically feasible but exhibit puzzling discrepancies with experimental results. In the present study, a computational investigation of the factors influencing dihydrogen activation are considered by large ensemble sampling of encounter complexes, deformation energies and the activation strain model for a silicon/nitrogen FLP and compared with a boron/phosphorous FLP. The analysis adds the previously missing dimension of Lewis acids&#8217; structural flexibility as a factor that influences preexponential terms beyond pure transition state energies. It sheds light on the origin of &#8220;overfrustration&#8221; (defined herein), indicates structural constraint in Lewis acids as a linchpin for activation of weak donor substrates, and allows drawing a more refined mechanistic picture of this emblematic reactivity.

         <title>The Perfluoro&#8208;o&#8208;phenylene&#8208;mercury Trimer [Hg(o&#8208;C6F4)]3 &#8211; a Textbook Example of Phase&#8208;Dependent Structural Differences</title>

         <dc:description>
This study shows how intermolecular interactions in a solid can deform a seemingly rigid molecule. It is one of the rare cases where a series of structural determinations in the crystalline phase and a highly reliable structural determination in the gaseous state by electron diffraction are available. As a heavy element containing structure of a free molecule it can also serve as a reference for the evaluation and development of quantum chemical methods.







Abstract
The geometric and electronic structure of [Hg(o&#8208;C6F4)]3 (1) in the gas phase, i.&#8201;e. free of intermolecular interactions, was determined by a synchronous gas&#8208;phase electron diffraction/mass spectrometry experiment (GED/MS), complemented by quantum chemical calculations. 1 is stable up to 498&#8197;K and the gas phase contains a single molecular form: the trimer [Hg(o&#8208;C6F4)]3. It has a planar structure of D3h symmetry with a Hg&#8211;C distance of 2.075(5)&#8197;&#197; and a Hg&#8211;Hg distance of 3.614(7)&#8197;&#197; (both rh1). Structural differences between the crystalline and gaseous state have been analyzed. Different DFT functional&#8208;basis combinations were tested, demonstrating the importance to consider the relativistic effects of the mercury atoms. The combination PBE0/MWB(Hg),cc&#8208;pVTZ(C,F) turned out to be the most appropriate for the geometry optimization of such organomercurials. The electronic structure of 1, the nature of the chemical bonding in C&#8722;Hg&#8722;C fragments and the nature of the Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Hg interactions have been analyzed in terms of the Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) and Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) approaches. The influence of the nature of halogen substitution on the structure of the molecules in the series [Hg(o&#8208;C6H4)]3, [Hg(o&#8208;C6F4)]3, [Hg(o&#8208;C6Cl4)]3, [Hg(o&#8208;C6Br4)]3 was also analyzed.

         <title>In situ reconstructured alloy nanosheets heterojunction for highly selective electrochemical CO2 reduction to formate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tin (Sn)&#8208;based materials are expected to realize efficient CO2 electroreduction into formate. Herein, we constructed a heterojunction by depositing Cu on Cu&#8208;doped SnS2 nanosheets. During the electrochemical reaction, this heterojunction evolves to a highly active phase of Cu2O@Cu6Sn5 while maintaining its two&#8208;dimensional morphology. Specifically, a partial current density of 35 mA cm&#8208;2 with an impressive faradaic efficiency of 93% for formate production was achieved over the evolved heterojunction. In situ and ex situ experiments elucidated the formation mechanism of the Cu2O@Cu6Sn5 heterojunction. Cu6Sn5 nanosheets were formed via a stepwise desulfurization process, while Cu2O was generated through its reaction with hydroxyl radicals. This evolved heterojunction with a high electrochemically active surface area synergistically stabilized the *OCHO intermediate, thereby significantly enhancing the selectivity and activity. Our findings provide insight into the structural evolution process and guide the development of selective electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;pot Functionalization for the Preparation of Cobaltocene&#8208;Modified Redox&#8208;Responsive Porous Microparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous organic cobaltocenium&#8208;containing particles are scarce in literature but highly interesting for their electrochemical properties and reusability in, for example, catalysis or magnetic systems. In this work, we present a scalable one&#8208;pot strategy to introduce tailorable amounts of cobaltocenium on a porous substrate, adjusting the electrochemical switching capability. For this purpose, 3&#8208;(triethoxysilyl)propan&#8208;1&#8208;amine (APTES) and ethynyl cobaltocenium hexafluorophosphate is used as functionalization agents for in&#8208;situ catalyst&#8208;free hydroamination, followed by silane condensation at the particles&#8217; surface. Functionalized particles are characterized by attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM), scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP&#8208;MS), powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) showing excellent control over the degree of functionalization, i.e., the added cobaltocenium reagents. The electrochemical stability and good addressability while preserving the porous structure are shown. By utilizing higher amounts of APTES, the overall cobaltocenium amount can be reduced in favor of additional amine groups, strongly affecting the electrochemical behavior, making this functionalization strategy a good platform for metallopolymer immobilization and tailored functionalization. Additionally, thermal treatment of the synthesized metallopolymer microparticles paves the way to magnetic properties with tailorable microporous architectures for end&#8208;of&#8208;life and upcycling aspects.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Ce(IV) Heteroleptic Double&#8208;Decker Complex with a New Helical Naphthalocyanine as a Potential Gearing Subunit</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This paper describes the synthesis of a cerium(IV)&#8208;based molecular gear composed of a thioether functionalized phthalocyanine anchoring ligand, and a helical naphthalocyanine rotating cogwheel functionalized with four carbazoles. The naphthalocyanine ligand 9 was obtained after eleven steps (overall yield of 0.2%) as a mixture of three geometrical isomers, two of which are chiral and exhibit high levels of steric hindrance, as shown by DFT calculations. Their attributions have been made using 1H&#8208;NMR based on their different symmetry groups. The ratio of isomers was also determined and the prochiral C4h naphthalocyanine shown to be the major compound (55%). Its heteroleptic complexation with cerium (IV) and the anchoring phthalocyanine ligand 10 gave the targeted molecular gear in a 16% yield.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This paper describes the synthesis of a cerium(IV)-based molecular gear composed of a thioether functionalized phthalocyanine anchoring ligand, and a helical naphthalocyanine rotating cogwheel functionalized with four carbazoles. The naphthalocyanine ligand 9 was obtained after eleven steps (overall yield of 0.2%) as a mixture of three geometrical isomers, two of which are chiral and exhibit high levels of steric hindrance, as shown by DFT calculations. Their attributions have been made using 1H-NMR based on their different symmetry groups. The ratio of isomers was also determined and the prochiral C4h naphthalocyanine shown to be the major compound (55%). Its heteroleptic complexation with cerium (IV) and the anchoring phthalocyanine ligand 10 gave the targeted molecular gear in a 16% yield.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrolytes for Aluminum&#8208;Ion Batteries: Progress and Outlook</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs), as electrochemical energy storage technologies, are advantageous because of their high theoretical specific capacity, lightweightness, zero pollution, safety, inexpensiveness, and abundant resources, which make them recent research hot spots. However, their electrolyte issues significantly limit their commercialization. The electrolyte choices for AIBs are significantly limited, and most of the available choices do not facilitate the three&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer reaction of Al3+/Al. Thus, this review presents an overview of recent advances in electrolytes, as well as modification strategies for AIBs, to clarify the limitations of existing AIB electrolytes and offer guidance for improving their performances. Furthermore, the advantages as well as limitations and possible solutions for each electrolyte are discussed, after which the future of AIB electrolytes is envisioned.</dc:description>

         <title>Symmetric Aromatic Amidoalkylations of Triphenylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triphenylene derivatives are highly investigated for their electronic, supramolecular and photophysical properties, but the direct modification of the central aromatic core is particularly challenging especially in the internal positions 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, and 12. Herein we present an efficient alkylation method of 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexasubstituted triphenylene derivatives leading to tris&#8208;alkylated C3&#8208;symmetric derivatives in good yields using N&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)carboxamide or N&#8208;(alkoxylmethyl)carboxamide alkylating agents.</dc:description>

         <title>[5]Molecular Necklaces Formed Through Zn2+&#8208;Templated Binding of Macrocycles to Dynamically Formed Imines as Guest Recognition Sites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we demonstrate an &#8220;in&#8208;ring establishing&#8221; strategy for assembling interlocked molecules through dynamic imine formation, &#8220;establishing&#8221; the host recognition sites in situ. Using Zn2+ ions to template the assembly of a pyridine&#8208;containing macrocycle with semidumbbell&#8208;shaped triazole&#8208;containing aldehyde and amine derivatives, we obtained the corresponding [2]rotaxane in high yield (85%) after subsequent imine reduction (NaBH4) and amine protonation (NH4PF6). We performed the same three steps (assembly, reduction, protonation) to prepare a stable and highly symmetrical [5]molecular necklace ([5]MN) from 12 components (two almost&#8208;90&#176;&#8208;oriented dialdehydes, two almost&#8208;90&#176;&#8208;oriented diamines, four macrocycles, four Zn2+ ions) in an overall yield of 69%.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperative NHC and Photoredox Catalyzed Radical Aminoacylation of Alkenes to Tetrahydropyridazines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetrahydropyridazines constitute an important structural motif found in numerous natural products and pharmaceutical compounds. Herein, we report an&#160;aminoacylation reaction of alkenes that enables the synthesis of&#160;1,4,5,6&#8208;tetrahydropyridazines through cooperative N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) and photoredox catalysis. This approach involves the&#160;6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig&#160;cyclization of&#160;N&#8208;centered&#160;hydrazonyl radicals, generated via single&#8208;electron oxidation of hydrazones, followed by a radical&#8211;radical coupling step.&#160;The mild process tolerates a wide range of common functional groups and affords a variety of&#160;tetrahydropyridazines&#160;in moderate to high yields. Preliminary investigations using chiral NHC catalysts demonstrate the potential of this protocol for asymmetric radical reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Selective Boron&#8208;Wittig Reaction: a Practical Method to Synthesize Trans&#8208;Aryl Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Olefins play an essential role in synthetic chemistry, serving not only as important synthons but also as key functional groups in numerous bio&#8208;active molecules. Consequently, there has been considerable interest in the development of more powerful methods for olefins. While the Wittig reaction stands as a prominent choice for olefin synthesis due to its simplicity and the ready availability of raw materials, its limitation lies in the challenge of controlling cis&#8208;trans selectivity, hampering its broader application. In this study, a novel Boron&#8208;Wittig reaction has been developed utilizing gem&#8208;bis(boryl)alkanes and aldehydes as starting materials. This method enables creating favourable intermediates, which possess less steric hindrance, and leading to trans&#8208;olefins via intramolecular O&#8211;B bonds elimination. Notably, synthesis studies have validated its good efficacy in modifying bioactive molecules and synthesizing drug molecules with great trans&#8208;selectivity. Furthermore, the reaction mechanism was elucidated based on intermediate trapping experiments, isotope labelling studies, and kinetic analyses.</dc:description>

         <title>Stacking Transformation&#8208;Triggered Circularly Polarized Luminescence Reversion in &#947;&#8208;Cyclodextrins&#8208;Pyrene Co&#8208;assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#8203;Considerable attention has been directed towards cyclodextrins (CDs) in the creation of co&#8208;assembled CPL&#8208;active materials, owing to their intrinsic chiral host cavities and synergistic host&#8208;guest interactions. However, achieving reversed CPL emission regulation with single&#8208;handedness CDs moiety poses a significant challenge. In this study, we have devised a series of &#947;&#8208;CD&#8208;based host&#8208;guest complexes comprising dual pyrene imidazolium derivatives with multiple linkers, which exhibit reversed circularly polarized emission. We have uncovered that the transformation of excimer stacking within &#947;&#8208;CD/pyrene complexes contributes to the inverted CPL emissions originating from a single&#8208;handed chiral host. This research elucidates the phenomenom of (+)&#8208; and (&#8208;)&#8208;circularly polarized excimer emission (CPEE) within &#947;&#8208;CD, arising from right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed stacking conformations, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Indole Nucleophile Triggers Mechanistic Divergence in Ni&#8208;Photoredox N&#8211;Arylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study presents a Ni&#8208;photoredox method for indole N&#8208;arylation, broadening the range of substrates to include indoles with unprotected C3&#8208;positions and base&#8208;sensitive groups. Through detailed mechanistic inquiries, a Ni(I/III) mechanism was uncovered, distinct from those commonly proposed for Ni&#8208;catalyzed amine, thiol, and alcohol arylation, as well as from the Ni(0/II/III) cycle identified for amide arylation under almost identical conditions. The key finding is the formation of a Ni(I) intermediate bearing the indole nucleophile as a ligand prior to oxidative addition, which is rare for Ni&#8208;photoredox carbon&#8208;heteroatom coupling and has a profound impact on the reaction kinetics and scope. The pre&#8208;coordination of indole renders a more electron&#8208;rich Ni(I) intermediate, which broadens the scope by enabling fast reactivity even with challenging electron&#8208;rich aryl bromide substrates. Thus, this work highlights the often&#8208;overlooked influence of X&#8208;type ligands on Ni oxidative addition rates and illustrates yet another mechanistic divergence in Ni&#8208;photoredox C&#8211;heteroatom couplings.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This study presents a Ni-photoredox method for indole N-arylation, broadening the range of substrates to include indoles with unprotected C3-positions and base-sensitive groups. Through detailed mechanistic inquiries, a Ni(I/III) mechanism was uncovered, distinct from those commonly proposed for Ni-catalyzed amine, thiol, and alcohol arylation, as well as from the Ni(0/II/III) cycle identified for amide arylation under almost identical conditions. The key finding is the formation of a Ni(I) intermediate bearing the indole nucleophile as a ligand prior to oxidative addition, which is rare for Ni-photoredox carbon-heteroatom coupling and has a profound impact on the reaction kinetics and scope. The pre-coordination of indole renders a more electron-rich Ni(I) intermediate, which broadens the scope by enabling fast reactivity even with challenging electron-rich aryl bromide substrates. Thus, this work highlights the often-overlooked influence of X-type ligands on Ni oxidative addition rates and illustrates yet another mechanistic divergence in Ni-photoredox C&#8211;heteroatom couplings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Assessing Solid Catalysts with Ionic Liquid Layers (SCILL) from Molecular Dynamics Simulations:

On the role of local charge polarization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent developments in molecular mechanics modelling of metal catalyst surfaces with interfaces to complex ad&#8208;layers or bulk liquids enable the study of 10 nm scale systems by molecular dynamics simulations of up to microseconds. Therein, electronic polarization as otherwise benchmarked by quantum calculations is mimicked via atom&#8208;centered partial charges that are adjusted dynamically to account for changes in local environment. Apart from thermal fluctuations, this encompasses molecule association and dissociation processes as well as externally applied voltage. Here, we elaborate the concept of employing the charge equilibration method to the molecular dynamics simulation of solid catalysts, namely metal surfaces and substrate&#8208;supported metal nanoparticles. This showcases the association of reactants and their interplay with local charge polarization upon co&#8208;adsorption of ionic liquids or application of external voltage &#8211; thus paving the way to understanding complex interfaces in (electro&#8208;)catalysis from molecular dynamics simulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced electrochemical performance of NiMn layered double hydroxides/graphene oxide composites synthesized by one&#8208;step hydrothermal method for supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study aims to enhance the performance of supercapacitors, focusing particularly on optimizing electrode materials. While pure NiMn layered double hydroxides (LDHs) exhibit excellent electrochemical properties, they have limitations in achieving high specific capacitance. Therefore, this paper successfully synthesized composite materials of NiMn LDHs with varying loadings of graphene oxide (GO) using a hydrothermal method. Systematic physicochemical characterization of the synthesized materials, such as powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), field&#8208;emission scanning electron microscopy (FE&#8208;SEM), and Raman spectroscopy, revealed the influence of GO doping on the microstructure and electrochemical performance of NiMn LDHs. Electrochemical tests demonstrated that the NiMn LDHs/GO electrode material exhibited optimal electrochemical performance with a specific capacitance of 2096 F g&#8208;1 at 1 A g&#8208;1 current density and 1471 F g&#8208;1 at 10 A g&#8208;1, when GO doping level was 0.45 wt%. Furthermore, after 1000 cycles of stability testing, the material retained 53.3% capacitance at 5 A g&#8208;1, indicating good cyclic stability. This study not only provides new directions for research on supercapacitor electrode materials but also offers new strategies for developing low&#8208;cost and efficient electrode materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A Data&#8208;driven Approach&#160;for Enhanced CO2 Capture&#160;with Ruthenium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To attain carbon neutrality, significant efforts have been made to capture and use CO2. The homogeneous hydrogenation of CO2 catalyzed by transition metal complexes, particularly ruthenium complexes, has demonstrated significant advantages and is regarded as a viable approach for practical application. Insertion of CO2 into the Ru&#8208;H bond, producing the Ru&#8208;formate product, is the key step in the hydrogenation of CO2. In order to parameterize the catalytic activities in the CO2 insertion into the Ru&#8211;H bond, the concept of simplified mechanism&#8208;based approach with data&#8208;driven practice (SMADP) has been introduced in this paper. The results showed that the hydricity of the Ru&#8211;H complex (&#916;GH&#8208;) might serve as a single active descriptor in the process of CO2 insertion, and that a novel Ru complex in CO2 catalysis may not be easily obtained by mere modification of the auxiliary ligand at the ruthenium metal site.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Plasmon Resonance Allows to Correlate Molecular Properties with Diffusion Coefficients of Linear Chain Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Every biological and physicochemical process occurring in a fluid phase depends on the diffusion coefficient (D) of the species in solution. In the present work, a model to describe and fit the behaviour of D as a function of structure and extensive thermodynamics parameters in binary solutions of linear chain organic molecules is developed. Supporting experimental and computational evidences for this model are obtained by measuring D for a series of n&#8208;alcohols through a novel surface plasmon resonance method and molecular dynamics simulations. This allows to propose a kind of combined analysis to explain the dependence of D on various thermodynamic and structural parameters. The results suggest that for small linear systems in the range from 0 to 200 g mol&#8208;1 and under the assumption that the diffusive activation energy is a linear function of mass, D is strictly dependent on the molecular shape and on the relative strength of the solute&#8208;solvent intermolecular forces represented by a parameter named R. The newly proposed approach can be utilized to characterize and monitor progressive changes in physicochemical properties for any investigated species upon increasing the dimension of the aggregate/molecule along a certain direction.</dc:description>

         <title>The Effect of Reactive Oxygen Species on Respiratory Complex I Activity in Liposomes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Respiratory complex I (R&#8208;CI) is an essential enzyme in the mitochondrial electron transport chain but also a major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases and ageing. While the mechanism of ROS production by R&#8208;CI is well&#8208;established, the feedback of ROS on R&#8208;CI activity is poorly understood. Here, we perform EPR spectroscopy on R&#8208;CI incorporated in artificial membrane vesicles to reveal that ROS (particularly hydroxyl radicals) reduce R&#8208;CI activity by making the membrane more polar and by increasing its hydrogen bonding capability. Moreover, the mechanism that we have uncovered reveals that the feedback of ROS on R&#8208;CI activity via the membrane is transient and not permanent; lipid peroxidation is negligible for the levels of ROS generated under these conditions. Our successful use of modular proteoliposome systems in conjunction with EPR spectroscopy and other biophysical techniques is a powerful approach for investigating ROS effects on other membrane proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Double Chalcogen Bonding Recognition Arrays in Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;substituted pyridino&#8208;based congeners of Ebselen, named here as Pyrselen, incorporating proximal Se and N atoms, undergo dimerization in solution and in the solid state through a dual donor&#8208;acceptor arrangement of chalcogen bonding sites. Dimerization constants were measured within the 15&#8208;50 M&#8211;1 range.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;N-substituted pyridino-based congeners of Ebselen, named here as Pyrselen, incorporating proximal Se and N atoms, undergo dimerization in solution and in the solid state through a dual donor-acceptor arrangement of chalcogen bonding sites. Dimerization constants were measured within the 15-50 M&#8211;1 range. Computational studies on the dimers depict a notable charge-transfer contribution to the association, validating Pyrselen as an effective scaffold for designing chalcogen-bonding-based recognition motifs.

         <title>Merging of a Supramolecular Ligand with a Switchable Luminophore &#8211; Light&#8208;Responsiveness, Photophysics and Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: : In this contribution we report on a novel approach towards luminescent light&#8208;responsive ligands. To this end, cyanostilbene&#8208; guanidiniocarbonyl&#8208;pyrrole hybrids were designed and investigated. Merging of a luminophore with a supramolecular bioactive ligand bears numerous advantages by overcoming the typical drawbacks of drug&#8208;labelling, influencing the overall performance of the active species by attachment of a large luminophore. Here we were able to establish a simple and easily accessible synthesis route to different cyanostyryl&#8208;guanidininiocarbonyl&#8208;pyrrole (CGCP) derivatives. These compounds were investigated regarding their light&#8208;responsive double bond isomerisation, their molecular structures in single crystals by means of X&#8208;ray diffractometry, their emission properties by state of the art photophysical characterisation as well as bioimaging and assessment of cell toxicity.</dc:description>

         <title>Theoretical Insight into Complexation Between Cyclocarbons and C60 Fullerene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work conducts the comprehensive theoretical study on the non&#8208;covalent complexation between cyclocarbons and C60 fullerene for the first time. The binding energy between cyclocarbons and C60 fullerene is significantly stronger than that between two C18 or two C60 fullerenes, indicating a particularly strong affinity. The cyclocarbons and C60 fullerene can spontaneously assemble into complexes in the gas phase at room temperature, and the hydrophobic effect caused by the solvent environment can promote this binding. The binding strength with C60 fullerene increases almost linearly with the increase of cyclocarbon size, and the C34@C60 dimer exhibits a perfect nano&#8208;Saturn structure. As the ring size increases, the angle between the two cyclocarbons of the 2:1 trimers formed by cyclocarbons and C60 fullerene gradually decreases. In C60@2C34 trimer, the fullerene is symmetrically surrounded by two cyclocarbons. The results on the trimers formed by cyclocarbon and C60 fullerenes in a 1:2 ratio showed when the cyclocarbon sandwiched between two fullerenes is not quite large, the trimers exhibit an ideal dumbbell&#8208;like structure, and the presence of the first fullerene has a significant synergistic effect on the binding of the second one. The cyclocarbon greatly promotes the dimerization of fullerenes, which acted as a &#8220;molecular glue&#8221;.</dc:description>

         <title>A Review of Electrospun Carbon&#8208;based Nanofibers Materials Used in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries are gradually approaching their theoretical values (200&#8208;250 Wh kg&#8208;1), which cannot meet the fast&#8208;growing energy storage  demands. Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries are anticipated to supersede lithium&#8208;ion batteries as the next&#8208;generation energy storage system owing to their high theoretical specific capacity (1675 mAh g&#8208;1) and energy density (2600 Wh kg&#8208;1). Nonetheless, Li&#8208;S batteries encounter several challenges, including the inadequate conductivity of sulfur and lithium sulfide, sulfur's volume expansion, and the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides, all of which significantly impact the practical utilization of Li&#8208;S batteries. Electrospun carbon&#8208;based nanofibers can simultaneously resolve these issues with their economical preparation, distinctive nanostructure, and exceptional flexibility. This review presents the most recent research findings on electrospun carbon&#8208;based nanofibers materials serving as sulfur hosts and interlayer components in Li&#8208;S batteries. We analyzed the impact of the material's structural design on the performance of Li&#8208;S batteries and the relative underlying mechanism. Finally, the current challenges and issues faced by carbon&#8208;based nanofibers composites in the application of Li&#8208;S batteries are summarized, and the future development trajectory are outlined.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Despite the existence of three competing reactions for propargyloxyoxindoles, we report a chemoselectivity switch between enantioselective propargyl [2,3]&#8208;Wittig rearrangement and Conia&#8208;ene&#8208;type reactions, with suppression of the [1,2]&#8208;Wittig&#8208;type rearrangement. Using C1&#8208;symmetric imidazolidine&#8208;pyrroloimidazolone pyridine as the ligand and Ni(acac)2 as the Lewis acid, diverse 3&#8208;hydroxy 3&#8208;substituted oxindoles containing allenyl groups were obtained in up to 98% yield and 99% ee via asymmetric propargyl [2,3]&#8208;Wittig rearrangement. In the presence of AgOTf&#8208;Duanphos, chiral spiro dihydrofuran oxindoles were given in up to 98% yield and 91% ee through a Conia&#8208;ene&#8208;type reaction.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Cu&#8208;catalyzed Ullmann&#8208;Goldberg cross&#8208;coupling between aryl iodides and oxamates is shown to afford the corresponding N&#8208;aryloxamates with yields ranging from moderate to excellent, when the oxamate precursor incorporates a bulky tertiary alkyl group effectively preventing product degradation under the strongly basic reaction conditions. The final oxamic acids are then generated through the acid hydrolysis of the oxamate in high yields. These acids were then converted into urethanes using PIDA under thermal conditions or a visible&#8208;light Fe&#8208;LMCT process. While electron&#8208;deficient N&#8208;aryl oxamic acids provide urethanes with high efficiencies, electron&#8208;rich counterparts led to diminished yields due to aryl group over&#8208;oxidation induced by PIDA.</dc:description>

         <title>Helix&#8208;to&#8208;Disc Conversion of Thia[6]helicenes into Coronenes Facilitated by Sulfur Oxidation and Fluorination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Helicenes, with their unique helical structures, have long captured the interest of synthetic chemists, not only as end products, but also as versatile platforms for further chemical transformations. However, transforming [6]helicene into planar coronene typically requires harsh conditions and poses significant challenges. Herein, we demonstrate that replacing the terminal benzene ring of [6]helicene with a thiophene ring enables its photochemical transformation into coronene. Sulfur oxidation of the thiophene ring enables the corresponding thermal transformation, and the terminal tetrafluorination of the opposite benzene ring further accelerates this process, yielding 1,2&#8208;difluorocoronene, as confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The transformation begins with an intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, whose activation energy is significantly lowered by these structural changes. Our findings underscore the utility of strategic modifications such as sulfur oxidation and fluorination in promoting this "helix&#8208;to&#8208;disc"&#160;conversion and opening new avenues for synthesizing functional polycyclic aromatics.</dc:description>

         <title>Syntheses of diarylmethanes via an oxidative benzylic functionalization of p&#8208;alkyl phenol derivatives under quaternary ammonium hypoiodite catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein report two strategies for the quaternary ammonium hypoiodite&#8208;mediated oxidative benzylic functionalization of p&#8208;alkyl phenol derivatives. By using either dibenzoylperoxide or H2O2 in hexafluoroisopropanol in the presence of tetrabutyl ammonium iodide gives access to activated intermediates which can then be coupled with electron&#8208;rich aromatic compounds. Overall, this sequential two&#8208;step one&#8208;pot procedure gives access to diversely decorated diarylmethane derivatives straightforwardly. Furthermore, the suitability of these products to undergo further oxidation reactions was successfully demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>An Effective Strategy on Synthesizing a Stable SiOx&#8208;Based Anode for High Density Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silicon oxides (SiOx) have received extensive attention as an promising anode candidate for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, their commerical applications have been seriously hindered by low conductivity,&#160;large&#160;volume expansion and unstable soild&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI) layer, which result in low intial coulombic efficiency, poor rate performance and short cycling lifepan. In this work, we demonstrate a simple way to prepare a series of SiOx&#160;materials with lithium&#160;fluoride&#160;(LiF) modified by hydrothermal method and carbothermal&#160;modification. When the mass ratio of SiOx&#160;and LiF equals 1:0.15, the long&#8208;term cycling capacity retention can be greatly improve form 30.2% to 76.7% after 200 cycles. The result is primarily&#160;because the enhancement&#160;of electrons and&#160;Li+&#8208;ions&#160;transport and&#160;the stability of SEI layer due to LiF addition. However, excess LiF addition can hinder the diffusion of Li+&#8208;ions. This study presents the great potential of LiF modified on SiOx&#160;anode materials for LIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Green Synthesis of the Triazine Derivatives and their Application for the Benign Electrocatalytic Reaction of Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work uses green sustainable reactions twice. Firstly, it is microwave synthesis: 2,4,6&#8208;tribiphenyl&#8208;4&#8208;yl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine and similar compounds were prepared in a closed microwave reactor in n&#8208;octane by the Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction. Second, a hybrid electrocatalyst for the highly demanded electrochemical reaction of nitrate reduction to ammonia (NO3RR) was prepared based on this material. This reaction has great potential to replace the energy&#8208;intensive Haber&#8208;Bosch process, and in addition, has independent value for the elimination of nitrate contamination of water resources. As shown in the work, microwave synthesis is an eco&#8208;friendly method for the synthesis of complex organic compounds; fast, selective and with a high yield of the target product. The electrocatalyst deposited on the graphite electrode consisted of a layer of 2,4,6&#8208;tribiphenyl&#8208;4&#8208;yl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine and related compounds coated with cobalt oxide. The hybrid catalyst was firmly retained on the graphite electrode during NO3RR and the material showed impressive stability with almost no decrease in catalytic activity even after the fifth cycle. Both 2,4,6&#8208;tribiphenyl&#8208;4&#8208;yl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine and the catalyst based on this substance were characterized by SEM, XPS, XRD, UV&#8208;vis spectra, cyclic (and linear) voltammetry, and chronoamperometry. This work can serve as a starting point for the development of stable and durable electrocatalysts for NO3RR using triazine derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust and Irreversible Sortase&#8208;Mediated Ligation by Empolyment of Sarkosyl</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sortase&#8208;mediated ligation (SML) is a widely used method for peptide and protein ligation due to ease of substrate preparation and fast enzymatic kinetics. But there are drawbacks that limit broader applications. Sorting motif in substrates may not be exposed to sortase efficiently due to folding or aggregation. In addition, the ligation is reversible under transpeptidation equilibrium that restricts ligation yield. Here we report a simple but robust method to overcome such limitations. By employment of sarkosyl, the detergent alters substrate conformation to raise sorting motif accessibility for sortase catalysis. Moreover, transpeptidation becomes irreversible presumably by formation of micelle to shield ligation products from sortase. In consequence, excellent yields were achieved from sortase variants with different substrate specificity. Notably, this method is compatible with peptides or proteins capable of forming liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS), presenting a powerful approach for the conjugation of aggregation&#8208;prone substrates. Therefore, we believe the sarkosyl&#8208;enhanced SML could be widely applied in peptide and protein chemistry and the unique irreversible transpeptidation mechanism offers an insight to detergent&#8208;driven equilibrium.</dc:description>

         <title>Skeletal Editing by Hypervalent Iodine Mediated Nitrogen Insertion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hypervalent iodine reagents are versatile and readily accessible reagents that have been extensively applied in contemporary synthesis in modern organic chemistry. Among them, iodonitrene (ArI=NR), is a powerful reactive species, widely used for a single&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;atom insertion reaction, and skeletal editing to construct N&#8208;heterocycles. Skeletal editing with reactive iodonitrene components has recently emerged as an exciting approach in modern chemical transformation. These reagents have been extensively used to produce biologically relevant heterocycles and functionalized molecular architectures. Recently, the insertion of a nitrogen&#8208;atom into hydrocarbons to generate N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds using hypervalent iodine reagents has been a significant focus in the field of molecular editing reactions. In this review, we discuss the rapidly emerging field of nitrene insertion, including skeletal editing and nitrogen insertion, using hypervalent iodine reagents to access nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, and the current mechanistic understanding of these processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Development of Inverse&#8208;Type Nucleoside Diarylethene Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nucleosidic diarylethenes (DAEs) have evolved from an emerging class of photochromes into a well&#8208;established option for integrating photochromic functionalities into biological systems. However, a comprehensive understanding of how chemical structure influences their photochromic properties remains essential. While structural features, such as an inverse connection between the aryl residues and the ethene bridge, are well&#8208;documented for classical DAEs, their application to nucleosidic DAEs has been underexplored. In this study, we address this gap by developing three distinct types of inverse nucleosidic DAEs &#8211; semi&#8208;inverse thiophenes, semi&#8208;inverse uridines and inverse uridines. We successfully synthesized these compounds and conducted comprehensive analyses of their photostationary states, thermal stability, reversibility, and reaction quantum yields. Additionally, we conducted an in&#8208;depth comparison of their photochromic properties with those of their normal&#8208;type counterparts. Among the synthesized compounds, seven semi&#8208;inverse thiophenes exhibited the most promising characteristics. Notably, these compounds demonstrated excellent fatigue resistance, with up to 96% retention of photochromic activity over 40 switching cycles, surpassing the performance of all comparable nucleosidic DAEs reported to date. These findings hold significant promise for future applications in various fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Bridging Titanium Nitrido Complexes Containing A Linear Ti&#8211;N&#8211;Ti Core with A Two&#8208;Coordinate Nitrido Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of titanium m2&#8208;nitrido complexes supported by the triamidoamine ligand Xy&#8208;N3N (Xy&#8208;N3N = {(3,5&#8208;Me2C6H3)NCH2CH2}3N3&#8211;) is reported. The titanium azido complex [(Xy&#8208;N3N)TiN3] (1&#8208;N3), prepared by salt metathesis of the chloride complex [(Xy&#8208;N3N)TiCl] (1&#8208;Cl) with NaN3, reacted with lithium metal or with alkali metal naphthalenides (alkali metal M = Na, K, and Rb) in THF to give the corresponding dinuclear m2&#8208;nitrido complexes M[(Xy&#8208;N3N)Ti=N&#8208;Ti(Xy&#8208;N3N)] (2&#8208;M; M = Li, Na, K, Rb). Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies of 2&#8208;Li, 2&#8208;Na, and 2&#8208;K revealed alkali metal dependent structures in the solid state. While 2&#8208;Li and 2&#8208;K contain a m2&#8208;nitrido ligand with a linear Ti&#8211;N&#8211;Ti core, 2&#8208;Na includes a m3&#8208;nitrido ligand as part of a T&#8208;shape Ti2NaN fragment with the sodium cation weekly coordinated to the nitrido nitrogen atom. When the synthesis of the nitrido complexes was carried out in the presence of excess alkali metals, selective decomposition of the nitrido complexes was observed affording some intractable titanium species along with the trialkali metal salts [M3(Xy&#8208;N3N)] (3&#8208;M) (M = Li, Na, K, and Rb). These salts were also prepared by deprotonation of (Xy&#8208;N3N)H3 with the corresponding alkali metal hexamethyldisilazide and characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy as well as single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A series of titanium m2-nitrido complexes supported by the triamidoamine ligand Xy-N3N (Xy-N3N = {(3,5-Me2C6H3)NCH2CH2}3N3&#8211;) is reported. The titanium azido complex [(Xy-N3N)TiN3] (1-N3), prepared by salt metathesis of the chloride complex [(Xy-N3N)TiCl] (1-Cl) with NaN3, reacted with lithium metal or with alkali metal naphthalenides (alkali metal M = Na, K, and Rb) in THF to give the corresponding dinuclear m2-nitrido complexes M[(Xy-N3N)Ti=N-Ti(Xy-N3N)] (2-M; M = Li, Na, K, Rb). Single crystal X-ray diffraction studies of 2-Li, 2-Na, and 2-K revealed alkali metal dependent structures in the solid state. While 2-Li and 2-K contain a m2-nitrido ligand with a linear Ti&#8211;N&#8211;Ti core, 2-Na includes a m3-nitrido ligand as part of a T-shape Ti2NaN fragment with the sodium cation weekly coordinated to the nitrido nitrogen atom. When the synthesis of the nitrido complexes was carried out in the presence of excess alkali metals, selective decomposition of the nitrido complexes was observed affording some intractable titanium species along with the trialkali metal salts [M3(Xy-N3N)] (3-M) (M = Li, Na, K, and Rb). These salts were also prepared by deprotonation of (Xy-N3N)H3 with the corresponding alkali metal hexamethyldisilazide and characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy as well as single crystal X-ray diffraction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and characterization of a novel trinuclear rhodamine&#8208;Gd(III) complex, along with two analogous mononuclear rhodamine&#8208;Gd(III) complexes, are reported. All complexes displayed good selectivity in a human glioma cell line (T98G) when compared to a glial cell line (SVG p12), with low cytotoxicities. Superior tumor cell uptake for these Gd(III) complexes was observed at lower incubation concentrations compared to previously&#8208;reported delocalized lipophilic cations such as a rhodamine&#8208;lanthanoid (III) probe and Gd(III)&#8208;arylphosphonium complexes, with&#160;ca.&#160;150% and 250% increases in Gd uptake, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Analysis of (g,g', g'', &#8208; Trifluoro)neopentyl (TFNP) Aryl ethers as a Polar Aliphatic Motif</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A route is developed to (g,g&#8217;,g&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;trifluoro)neopentyl (TFNP) aryl ethers to extend the methods for the introduction of the tert&#8208;butyl group, carrying a fluorine on each of the methyl&#160; substituents. The route combines neopentyltosylate 3 with phenols and thiophenols to give efficient substitution reactions to the corresponding TFNP aryl ethers. The three C&#8208;F bonds adopt a helical propeller conformation as revealed by computation and single crystal X&#8208;ray structure analysis. The LogPs of TFNP ethers are lower (more hydrophilic) than their tert&#8208;butyl analogues. The metabolism of selected TFNP ethers was explored in the fungus Cunninghamella elegans.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogen Impact on the Supramolecular Organization of Chiral Phthalimide EmittersDisplaying Room Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Room temperature phosphorescence from organic materials has attracted an increasing attention in the recent years due to their potential application in various advancing technologies, notably in bioimaging and displays. In this context, heavy atoms such as halogen ones revealed useful tools to enhance the spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) of molecular organic phosphors. However, the effect of halogen at the supramolecular level remains less understood, especially in the field of molecular crystals where additional factors can impact the phosphorescence emission. Here, we investigate external effect of halogens on the phosphorescence of chiral phthalimides molecular crystals. The results show that changing the nature of the halogen atom onto the phthalimide core leads to an evolution of the photophysical properties of the materials which does not necessarily follow the classical trend imposed by the expected internal heavy atom effect. Beyond this aspect, we showed that the halogen atom has a profound impact on the packing between the chromophores at the supramolecular level which is of paramount importance towards the optical properties (PLQY and lifetimes) of the different phosphors examined.</dc:description>

         <title>Binary Catalytic Hydrogen/Deuterium Exchange of Free &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids and Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The increasing demand for deuterium&#8208;labeled amino acids and derivatives has heightened interest in direct hydrogen/deuterium exchange reactions of free amino acids. Existing methods, including biocatalysis and metal catalysis, typically require expensive deuterium sources or excessive use of deuterium reagents and often struggle with site selectivity. In contrast, our pioneering binary catalysis system, employing benzaldehyde and Cs2CO3 in the presence of inexpensive D2O with minimal stoichiometric quantities, facilitates efficient hydrogen/deuterium exchange at the &#945;&#8208;position of amino acids without the need for protecting groups in the polar aprotic solvent DMSO. The process is highly compatible with most natural and non&#8208;natural &#945;&#8208;amino acids and derivatives, even those with potentially reactive functionalities. This advancement not only addresses the cost and efficiency concerns of existing methods but also significantly broadens the applicability and precision of deuterium labeling in biochemical research.</dc:description>
