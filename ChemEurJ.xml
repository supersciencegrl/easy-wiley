         <title>Closed Bipolar Electrode Array for Optical Reporting Reaction Coupled Electrochemical Sensing and Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this review, closed bipolar electrode (BPE) array using an electrofluorochromism (EFC) or electrochemiluminescence (ECL) reaction as the reporting reaction is centered on. Electrochemical signals at one pole of the closed BPE array can be transduced into the EFC or ECL signals at the opposite pole. Therefore, the current signal of a redox reaction can be easily detected and imaged by monitoring the luminescence signal. Recent developments of the closed BPE array based EFC and ECL sensing and imaging are summarized and discussed in detail. Finally, we propose the challenges and opportunities for improving the spatial resolution of the closed BPE array based electrochemical imaging, and emphasize the important application of this technique to the imaging of cellular activities at single&#8208;cell level.</dc:description>

         <title>A Cascade Sonogashira Cross&#8208;Coupling&#8208;Substitution&#8208;Elimination Reaction for the Synthesis of Linear Conjugated Dienynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling, nucleophilic substitution and elimination cascade reaction allows the synthesis of otherwise difficult to obtain linear dienynes, in moderate to high yields. Ionic liquids are suitable recyclable solvents for the reaction. This synthetic strategy opens new ways to prepare highly conjugated alkenes and alkynes.







Abstract
The engagement in tandem of well&#8208;known organic reactions such as the Pd&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reaction, nucleophilic substitution and elimination reactions, enables the synthesis of otherwise difficult to obtain linear dienynes, in moderate to high yields. This retrosynthetic approach opens new ways to prepare highly conjugated alkenes and alkynes. Furthermore, ionic liquids are suitable solvents to perform the cascade reaction and recycle the metal catalysts.

         <title>Continuous&#8208;Flow Divergent Lithiation of 2,3&#8208;Dihalopyridines: Deprotolithiation versus Halogen Dance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The divergent lithiation of 2,3&#8208;dihalopyridines is reported. Taking advantage of continuous&#8208;flow technology, either the deprotolithiation or the halogen dance is carried out. After subsequent trapping with various electrophiles, 25 examples of both regioisomers were obtained in excellent yields and selectivities. Finally, this methodology was scaled up and a promising space&#8208;time yield was obtained.







Abstract
We describe herein the first halogen dance (HD) in continuous flow on 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;3&#8208;bromopyridine by selectively trapping a (pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)lithium species that is known to undergo the halogen&#8208;dance process. In addition, this lithiated intermediate was trapped at lower temperature before the HD occurs. The HD process was extended to fluoro&#8208;iodopyridines by using various electrophiles to afford 28 examples with yields ranging from 42 to 97&#8201;% with very short residence times. Finally, scale up of the reaction was demonstrated, affording a promising space&#8208;time yield (STY) of 4.2&#8197;kg.h&#8722;1.L&#8722;1.

         <title>A Stereodivergent Approach to the Synthesis of gem&#8208;Diborylcyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A designed strategy for a highly efficient protocol for the diastereodivergent construction of gem&#8208;dibroylcyclopropanes has been established. This was accomplished via the Pd(OAc)2&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation reaction of the gem&#8208;diborylalkene &#8220;carbenophile&#8208;reactive&#8221; groups with different &#945;&#8208;diazoarylacetates and &#945;&#8208;diazoaryl&#8208;CF3.







Abstract
We report a designed stereodivergent strategy for the synthesis of gem&#8208;diborylcyclopropanes. The reaction provides a highly modular approach to prepare cyclopropane ring variants bearing gem&#8208;(Bpin,Bpin), gem&#8208;(Bpin,Bdan), and gem&#8208;(Bpin,BF3K), with outstanding levels of stereocontrol. This was achieved by diastereoselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation reactions of gem&#8208;diborylalkenes with &#945;&#8208;diazoarylacetates and &#945;&#8208;diazoaryl&#8208;trifluoromethyl. The key to the success of this general protocol was the diastereoselective trifluorination reaction of gem&#8208;diborylcyclopropanes, followed by the stereospecific interconversion of the trifluoroborate salts into the Bdan group.

         <title>Light&#8208;Responsive Oligothiophenes Incorporating Photochromic Torsional Switches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twist it! A light&#8208;responsive molecular design to tune the &#960;&#8208;conjugation extension of oligothiophenes has been established. The relationship between molecular structure and optoelectronic properties was comprehensively studied both experimentally and theoretically. The results highlight the functionality of the proposed molecular architecture as a promising candidate for the development of novel light&#8208;responsive optoelectronic technologies.







Abstract
We present a quaterthiophene and sexithiophene that can reversibly change their effective &#960;&#8208;conjugation length through photoexcitation. The reported compounds make use of light&#8208;responsive molecular actuators consisting of an azobenzene attached to a bithiophene unit by both direct and linker&#8208;assisted bonding. Upon exposure to 350&#8197;nm light, the azobenzene undergoes trans&#8208;to&#8208;cis isomerization, thus mechanically inducing the oligothiophene to assume a planar conformation (extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation). Exposure to 254&#8197;nm wavelength promotes azobenzene cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans isomerization, forcing the thiophenic backbones to twist out of planarity (confined &#960;&#8208;conjugation). Twisted conformations are also reached by cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans thermal relaxation at a rate that increases proportionally with the conjugation length of the oligothiophene moiety. The molecular conformations of quaterthiophene and sexithiophene were characterized by using steady&#8208;state UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography and quantum&#8208;chemical modeling. Finally, we tested the proposed light&#8208;responsive oligothiophenes in field&#8208;effect transistors to probe the photo&#8208;induced tuning of their electronic properties.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Push&#8208;Pull Diphenylsulfone Derivatives towards Aggregation&#8208;Induced Narrowband Deep Blue Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accompanying effects of restricted intramolecular rotations and intermolecular interactions in D&#8722;A&#8722;D&#8217; typed molecules led to successively blue&#8208;shifted wavelength and narrowed bandwidth from solution to amorphous film then to crystals, realizing deep blue TADF (&#955;=424&#8197;nm, CIE coordinate of (0.15, 0.08), &#916;EST=0.07&#8197;eV) with FWHM of 64&#8197;nm in crystals of tBuO&#8208;SOmAD.







Abstract
Narrowband deep blue thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) materials have attracted significant attention. Herein, four asymmetrical structured TADF emitters based on diphenylsulfone (DPS) acceptor and 9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroacridine (DMAC) donor with progressive performances were developed. The tert&#8208;butyloxy auxiliary electron&#8208;donor was adopted to restrict the intramolecular rotations and provide efficient steric hindrance. Regioisomerization by altering the substitution position of DMAC on DPS unit further enhanced the intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;molecular interactions. The accompanying effects yielded increased energy level, minimized reorganization energy, and inhibited non&#8208;radiative transitions in the crystals of tBuO&#8208;SOmAD, which achieved narrowband deep&#8208;blue emission peaking at 424&#8197;nm (FWHM=64&#8197;nm, &#934;F=33.6&#8201;%) through aggregation&#8208;induced, blue&#8208;shifted emission (AIBSE). In addition, deep&#8208;blue organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on tBuO&#8208;SOmAD realized the electroluminescence (EL) spectrum peaking located at 435&#8197;nm and CIE coordination of (0.12, 0.09).

         <title>An Endoplasmic Reticulum Targeting Type I Photosensitizer for Effective Photodynamic Therapy against Hypoxic Tumor Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ER&#8208;targeted benzophenothiazine&#8208;based photosensitizer NBS&#8208;ER was constructed, which triggered ER stress and induced apoptosis with significantly reduced dark toxicity and improved phototoxicity index (PI). In addition, excellent photodynamic therapeutic effect of NBS&#8208;ER was demonstrated in 4T1&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice.







Abstract
Organelle&#8208;targeted type I photodynamic therapy (PDT) shows great potential to overcome the hypoxic microenvironment in solid tumors. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an indispensable organelle in cells with important biological functions. When the ER is damaged due to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the accumulation of misfolded proteins will interfere with ER homeostasis, resulting in ER stress. Here, an ER&#8208;targeted benzophenothiazine&#8208;based photosensitizer NBS&#8208;ER was presented. ER targeting modification significantly reduced the dark toxicity and improved phototoxicity index (PI). NBS&#8208;ER could effectively produce O2&#8722;&#8901; with near&#8208;infrared irradiation, making its phototoxicity under hypoxia close to that under normoxia. Meanwhile, the photoinduced ROS triggered ER stress and induced apoptosis. In addition, NBS&#8208;ER possessed excellent photodynamic therapeutic effect in 4T1&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice.

         <title>Probing the Structural Dynamics of a Bacterial Chaperone in Its Native Environment by Nitroxide&#8208;Based EPR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Take a quick look: NarJ protein structural dynamics was investigated by SDSL&#8208;EPR in the complex environment of the cell. In particular, we exploited the sensitivity of nitroxide labels to report protein dynamics at room temperature. Moreover, we demonstrated that such studies can be performed within 15&#8197;minutes, thus preserving both cell integrity and the activity of the protein under investigation.







Abstract
One of the greatest current challenges in structural biology is to study protein dynamics over a wide range of timescales in complex environments, such as the cell. Among magnetic resonances suitable for this approach, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy coupled to site&#8208;directed spin labeling (SDSL&#8208;EPR) has emerged as a promising tool to study protein local dynamics and conformational ensembles. In this work, we exploit the sensitivity of nitroxide labels to report protein local dynamics at room temperature. We demonstrate that such studies can be performed while preserving both the integrity of the cells and the activity of the protein under investigation. Using this approach, we studied the structural dynamics of the chaperone NarJ in its natural host, Escherichia coli. We established that spin&#8208;labeled NarJ is active inside the cell. We showed that the cellular medium affects NarJ structural dynamics in a site&#8208;specific way, while the structural flexibility of the protein is maintained. Finally, we present and discuss data on the time&#8208;resolved dynamics of NarJ in cellular context.

         <title>Selective and Reversible Solvent Uptake in Tetra&#8208;4&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridyl)phenylmethane&#8208;based Supramolecular Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TPPM&#8208;based Supramolecular Organic Frameworks (SOFs) undergo reversible single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformations when exposed to vapours of selected organic solvents and heat, respectively. The observed selectivity is dictated by the fitting of the guest in the expanded SOFs, following the degree of packing coefficient.







Abstract
The dynamic behavior of supramolecular organic frameworks (SOFs) based on the rigid tetra&#8208;4&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridyl)phenylmethane (TPPM) organic tecton has been elucidated through 3D electron diffraction, X&#8208;ray powder diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis. The SOF undergoes a reversible single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation when exposed to vapours of selected organic solvents, moving from a closed structure with isolated small voids to an expanded structure with solvated channels along the b axis. The observed selectivity is dictated by the fitting of the guest in the expanded SOF, following the degree of packing coefficient. The effect of solvent uptake on TPPM solid&#8208;state fluorescence was investigated, evidencing a significant variation in the emission profile only in the presence of chloroform.

         <title>Chiral Anthranyl Trifluoromethyl Alcohols: Structures, Oxidative Dearomatization and Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral diphenylanthracenes with two fluorinated alcohols have two stereogenic centers and syn/anti atropisomery. Consequently, depending on their stereochemistry, they make different Hydrogen&#8208;bonded self&#8208;assemblies in the solid state, whereas in solution, they specifically react to provide different chiral dearomatized bisfluorinated ethers. The chiroptical properties of all anthranyl fluorinated molecules have been compared.







Abstract
Chiral trifluoromethyl alcohol groups were introduced at the hindered ortho positions of 9,10&#8208;diphenylanthracenes to investigate their effects on the physical properties and reactivity towards oxidative dearomatization. In such compact structures, the position in different quadrants and the preferred orientation of the &#8722;CH(OH)CF3 groups were determined by the relative and absolute configurations of each stereoisomer, respectively. As a consequence, the stereochemistry governs the organization of the H&#8208;bonded molecules in single crystals (homochiral dimers vs ribbon), whereas in chlorinated solvents, they all behave as discrete compounds. Concerning their reactivity, the stereospecific dearomative oxidation of these molecules leads to 9,10&#8208;bis&#8208;spiro&#8208;isobenzofuran&#8208;anthracenes, when using organic single&#8208;electron transfer oxidants. The chiroptical properties of the alcohols and the corresponding dearomatized products were compared and showed an important modulation of the intensity.

         <title>Photophysics of Anionic Bis(4H&#8208;imidazolato)CuI Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Homoleptic CuI 4H&#8208;imidazolate complexes show a remarkably broad and intense absorption spectrum ranging from the UV to NIR. The excited state decay pathways of four complexes selected for their electron&#8208;withdrawing and steric properties were studied by fs transient absorption spectroscopy and spectro&#8208;electrochemistry. A model&#8208;free 2D correlation approach was applied for data evaluation.







Abstract
In this paper, the photophysical behavior of four panchromatically absorbing, homoleptic bis(4H&#8208;imidazolato)CuI complexes, with a systematic variation in the electron&#8208;withdrawing properties of the imidazolate ligand, were studied by wavelength&#8208;dependent time&#8208;resolved femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. Excitation at 400, 480, and 630&#8197;nm populates metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer, intraligand charge transfer, and mixed&#8208;character singlet states. The pump wavelength&#8208;dependent transient absorption data were analyzed by a recently established 2D correlation approach. Data analysis revealed that all excitation conditions yield similar excited&#8208;state dynamics. Key to the excited&#8208;state relaxation is fast, sub&#8208;picosecond pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion, which is accompanied by the relocalization of electron density onto a single ligand from the initially delocalized state at Franck&#8208;Condon geometry. Subsequent intersystem crossing to the triplet manifold is followed by a sub&#8208;100&#8197;ps decay to the ground state. The fast, nonradiative decay is rationalized by the low triplet&#8208;state energy as found by DFT calculations, which suggest perspective treatment at the strong coupling limit of the energy gap law.

         <title>Bromine Pentafluoride BrF5, the Formation of [BrF6]&#8722; Salts, and the Stereochemical (In)activity of the Bromine Lone Pairs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking a closer look: We present the photochemical synthesis of BrF5, its high&#8208; and low&#8208;temperature crystal structures, its reactions with some alkali metal fluorides and a discussion of the free valence electron pairs on the bromine atoms of the BrF5 molecules and [BrF6]&#8722; anions by using intrinsic bond orbitals.







Abstract
BrF5 can be prepared by treating BrF3 with fluorine under UV light in the region of 300 to 400&#8197;nm at room temperature. It was analyzed by UV&#8208;Vis, NMR, IR and Raman spectroscopy. Its crystal structure was redetermined by X&#8208;ray diffraction, and its space group was corrected to Pnma. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations were performed for the band assignment of the vibrational spectra. A monoclinic polymorph of BrF5 was quantum chemically predicted and then observed as its low&#8208;temperature modification in space group P21/c by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. BrF5 reacts with the alkali metal fluorides AF (A=K, Rb) to form alkali metal hexafluoridobromates(V), A[BrF6] the crystal structures of which have been determined. Both compounds crystallize in the K[AsF6] structure type (R
, no. 148, hR24). For the species [BrF6]+, BrF5, [BrF6]&#8722;, and [IF6]&#8722;, the chemical bonds and lone pairs on the heavy atoms were investigated by means of intrinsic bond orbital analysis.

         <title>Self&#8208;Repairable and Flexible Polymer Network Electrolyte with Enhanced Lithium&#8208;Ion Conduction for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;healing quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolyte (SIPH&#8208;x&#8208;y%) with good flexibility was prepared by polyaddition method. SIPH&#8208;x&#8208;y% could show high room temperature ionic conductivity, high lithium ion transference number, and good interfacial stability with electrode. The Li/LFP battery assembled with SIPH&#8208;20&#8208;40% showed high specific capacity and excellent cycle performance.







Abstract
Developing high&#8208;performance functional polymer&#8208;based electrolytes is important for realizing next generation safe lithium metal batteries. In this study, a new type of quasi&#8208;solid polymer network electrolyte (SIPH&#8208;x&#8208;y%) was prepared by combining synthesized polymer network (SIPH) containing urethane bond linked ionic liquids (ILs), polyethylene glycol (PEG), and disulfide bond moieties, lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide salt (LiTFSI), and glyme type additive. It was found that SIPH&#8208;20&#8208;40% was mechanically flexible, self&#8208;healable, and showed high ionic conductivity of 2.67&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1. Also, SIPH&#8208;20&#8208;40% possesses a high lithium ion transference number of 0.43 and good electrochemical stability. These properties enabled the SIPH&#8208;20&#8208;40% electrolyte membrane to support Li/Li symmetrical cell to cycle stably during long term Li plating and stripping. The Li/SIPH&#8208;20&#8208;40%/LFP showed high delivered specific capacity and good stability (166.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 106 cycles at 0.2&#8197;C). Such glyme doped polymer network electrolyte provides new experimental findings for developing polymer&#8208;based electrolyte with excellent mechanical integrity and battery related properties.

         <dc:description>The superhydrophobic surface with expanded wetting behaviors, like tunable adhesion, hybrids surface hydrophobicity and smart hydrophobic switching etc., have attracted increasing attention due to their broad applications. The construction method, mechanism and advanced applications of special superhydrophobicity are reviewed, and the hydro/superhydrophobic modification are categorized and discussed based on their surface chemistry, and topographic design. The formation and maintenance of special superhydrophobicity at the meta&#8208;stable state are examined and explored. In addition, particular attention is paid to the utilization of special wettability in various applications, such as membrane distillation, droplet&#8208;based electricity generator and anti&#8208;fogging surfaces. Finally, the challenges for practical applications and future research directions are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>The Transformation of Inorganic to Organic Carbonates: Chasing for Reaction Pathways in Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanochemical reactions are solvent&#8208;free alternatives to solution&#8208;based syntheses enabling even conventionally&#8208;impossible transformations. Their reaction pathways, however, usually remain unexplored within the heavily vibrating, dense milling vessels. Here, we showcase how the green organic solvent diethyl carbonate is synthesized mechanochemically from inorganic alkali carbonates and how the complementary combination of milling parameter studies, synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction real time monitoring, and quantum chemical calculations reveal the underlying reaction pathways. With this, reaction intermediates are identified, and chemical concepts of solution&#8208;chemistry are challenged or corroborated for mechanochemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Effective Formation of New C(sp2)&#8211;S Bonds via Photoactivation of Alkylamine&#8208;based Electron Donor&#8211;Acceptor Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel visible light promoted production of C Aryl &#8211;S bonds through electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complexes of alkylamines with 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered (hetero)arene halides is presented. This represents the first EDA&#8208;based thiolation method not relying on &#960;&#8722;&#960; or a thiolate&#8208;anion&#8208;&#960; interactions and provides a readily access to heteroarene radicals, which can be suitably trapped by disulfide derivatives to form the corresponding versatile arylsulfides. Mechanistic investigations on the aspects of the whole process have been conducted by spectroscopic measurements, demonstrating the hypothesized EDA complex formation. Moreover, the strength of this method has been proven by a gram&#8208;scale experiment and the late stage derivatization of an anticoagulant drug.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionic &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH) Nanocrystal Stabilized by Small Isopolymolybdate Clusters as Reactive Core for Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>At near neutral to basic pH, hydrolysis induced aggregation to insoluble bulk iron&#8208;oxide is often regarded as the pitfalls of molecular iron clusters. Iron&#8208;oxide nanocrystals are encouragingly active over the molecular clusters and/or bulk oxides albeit, stabilizing such nanostructures in aqueous pH and under turnover condition remain a perdurable challenge. Herein, an Anderson&#160;[Mo7O24]6&#8208; isopolyanion, a small (0.85 nm) isolable polyoxometalate (POM) possessing only {31} atoms, has been introduced for the first time as a covalent linker to stabilize an infinitely stable and aqueous&#8208;soluble &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH) nanocore. During the hydrothermal isolation of the material, a partial dissociation of the parent [Mo7O24]6&#8208; may lead to the in&#8208;situ generation of few analogous [MoxOy]n&#8208; clusters, proved by Raman study, which can also participate in stabilizing the &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH) nanocore, MoxOy@FeO(OH). However, due to high ionic charge on {Mo=O} terminals of the [MoxOy]n&#8208;, they are covalently linked via MoVI&#8208;&#181;2O&#8208;FeIII bridging to &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH) core in MoxOy@FeO(OH), established by numerous spectroscopic and microscopic evidences. Such bonding mode is more likely as precedent from the coordination motif documented in the transition metal clusters stabilized by this POM. The &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH) nanocore of MoxOy@FeO(OH) behaves as potent active center for electrochemical water oxidation with a overpotential, 263 mV @ 10 mA cm&#8208;2, lower than that observed for bare &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH). Despite of some molybdenum dissolution from the POM ligands to the electrolyte, residual anionic POM fragments covalently bound to the OER active &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH) core of the MoxOy@FeO(OH) makes the surface predominantly ionic that results in an ordered electrical double layer to promote a better charge transport across the electrode&#8208;electrolyte junction, less likely in bulk &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH).</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Mechanism of H/D Exchange for Isobutane on H&#8208;BEA by Loading Zn Species in Zeolite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Kinetics of H/D hydrogen exchange between deuterated isobutane&#8208;  d  10  and Br&#248;nsted acid sites (BAS) of three zeolite samples (H&#8208;BEA, ZnO/H&#8208;BEA, Zn  2+  /H&#8208;BEA) were monitored with  1  H MAS NMR in situ at 343&#8211;468 K. The regioselective H/D exchange in the methyl groups detected on H&#8208;BEA can be rationalized in terms of the mechanism of indirect exchange, which involves protonation of the intermediate olefin and further hydride abstraction from the other alkane molecule by the formed carbenium ion. Loading of Zn species in zeolite results in decrease of the rate and increase of the activation energy of the exchange. The loaded Zn species provide the tuning effect on the reaction occurrence, changing the mechanism from the indirect one to the mechanism of the direct exchange.</dc:description>

         <title>A Porous Polyaromatic Solid for Vapor Adsorption of Xylene with High Efficiency, Selectivity, and Reusability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new porous polyaromatic solid displays unusual vapor adsorption behavior toward VOCs under ambient conditions, such as vapor adsorption of benzene over cyclohexane with 90&#8201;% selectivity, high affinity toward o&#8208;xylene over benzene and toluene with &gt;80&#8201;% selectivity, and ortho&#8208;selective adsorption ability (&gt;50&#8201;%) from mixed xylene isomers.







Abstract
Development of porous materials capable of capturing volatile organic compounds (VOCs), such as benzene and its derivatives, with high efficiency, selectivity, and reusability is highly demanded. Here we report unusual vapor adsorption behavior toward VOCs by a new porous solid, composed of a polyaromatic capsule bearing a spherical nanocavity with subnano&#8208;sized windows. Without prior crystallization and high&#8208;temperature vacuum drying, the porous polyaromatic solid exhibits the following five features: vapor adsorption of benzene over cyclohexane with 90&#8201;% selectivity, high affinity toward o&#8208;xylene over benzene and toluene with &gt;80&#8201;% selectivity, ortho&#8208;selective adsorption ability (&gt;50&#8201;%) from mixed xylene isomers, tight VOCs storage even under high temperature and vacuum conditions, and at least 5&#8197;times reusability for xylene adsorption. The observed adsorption abilities are accomplished at ambient temperature and pressure within 1&#8197;h, which has not been demonstrated by organic/inorganic porous materials reported previously.

         <title>Functional Nanomaterial&#8208;Modified Anodes in Microbial Fuel Cells: Advances and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Profiting from superior electrical properties, porosity, specific surface area and biocompatibility, nanomaterials show tremendous potential in promoting the power supply of microbial fuel cells. This Review provides an outline of recent progress on anode modification nanomaterials in microbial fuel cells from the viewpoint of different binding modes of bacteria and materials.







Abstract
Microbial fuel cell (MFC) is a promising approach that could utilize microorganisms to oxidize biodegradable pollutants in wastewater and generate electrical power simultaneously. Introducing advanced anode nanomaterials is generally considered as an effective way to enhance MFC performance by increasing bacterial adhesion and facilitating extracellular electron transfer (EET). This review focuses on the key advances of recent anode modification materials, as well as the current understanding of the microbial EET process occurring at the bacteria&#8208;electrode interface. Based on the difference in combination mode of the exoelectrogens and nanomaterials, anode surface modification, hybrid biofilm construction and single&#8208;bacterial surface modification strategies are elucidated exhaustively. The inherent mechanisms may help to break through the performance output bottleneck of MFCs by rational design of EET&#8208;related nanomaterials, and lead to the widespread application of microbial electrochemical systems.

         <title>Nonsymmetric [Pt(C^N*N&#8242;^C&#8242;)] Complexes: Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission in the Solid State and in Nanoparticles Tuned by Ligand Structure</title>

         <dc:description>
Square&#8208;planar PtII complexes with tetradentate nonsymmetric {C^N*N&#8242;^C&#8242;} ligands display aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) in the solid state and in nanoparticles formed upon mixing of their solutions in THF with water. The ability of the complexes to show AIE is determined by the steric and electronic properties of the ligands&#8217; aromatic systems.







Abstract
Five square&#8208;planar [Pt(C^N*N&#8242;^C&#8242;)] complexes (Pt1&#8211;Pt5) with novel nonsymmetric tetradentate ligands (L1&#8211;L5) were synthesized and characterized. Varying the structure of the metalating aromatic systems result in substantial changes in photophysical properties and intermolecular interaction mode of the complexes in solution and in solid state. The complexes are strongly emissive in tetrahydrofuran solution, with the band maxima ranging from 560 to 690&#8197;nm. Three of these complexes (Pt1, Pt2, Pt4) afford nanospecies upon injection of their solution into water, which show aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) with a strong red shift of emission bands. In the solid state, crystalline samples of these complexes demonstrate mechanochromism upon grinding with a bathochromic shift of the emission. DFT and TD&#8208;DFT computational analysis of monomeric Pt1&#8211;Pt5 in solution and model dimeric emitters formed through intermolecular interaction of Pt1, Pt2, Pt4 molecules allowed assignment of observed AIE to the 3MMLCT excited states of Pt&#8208;Pt bonded aggregates of these complexes.

         <title>Synthesis of Highly Accessible and Reactive Sites in Gold Nanoparticles Using Bound Bis(Diphenylphosphine) Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis(diphenylphosphine) ligands are used to stabilize gold nanoparticles in solution. 2&#8208;napthalenethiol titrations are used to measure the number of accessible sites on the nanoparticle surfaces. The most accessible nanoparticle has 61&#8201;% of the total gold atoms available for binding. The resazurin reduction rate scales with the number of binding sites.







Abstract
While bound organic ligands provide steric protection against aggregation for metallic nanoparticles in solution, they can block a large fraction of the surface atoms which are needed for binding in catalysis and sensing applications. In this work, highly accessible Au nanoparticles ligated with bis(diphenylphosphine) molecules are synthesized and characterized in solution. Characterization is performed using high angle annular dark field&#8208;scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF&#8208;STEM), ultraviolet&#8208;visible (UV&#8208;Vis) spectroscopy, and fluorescence chemisorption experiments. These synthesized nanoparticles are accessible to a 2&#8208;napthalenethiol (2&#8208;NT) probe molecule in solution. The highest 2&#8208;NT accessibility is observed when using 1,1&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)methane (dppm) ligand where 61&#8201;% of the total gold atoms are accessible. It is hypothesized that increasing the rigidity of the bis(diphenylphosphine) ligand increases the number of binding sites on the Au nanoparticles. These nanoparticles are catalytically active for resazurin reduction, and the resazurin reduction rate scales with the number of binding sites.

         <title>Access to Enantiomerically Pure P&#8208;Stereogenic Primary Aminophosphine Sulfides under Reductive Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A route to enantiomerically pure P&#8208;stereogenic primary aminophosphine sulfides by reductive C&#8722;N bond cleavage with lithium in liquid ammonia is presented. Undesirable side reactions during the cleavage can be suppressed by using aliphatic substitution patterns. Quantum chemical and spectroscopic insights into a complex of a chiral primary aminophosphine sulfide and the lithium salt of (R)&#8208;BINOL&#8208;PSSH in solution was provided.







Abstract
Stereochemically pure phosphines with phosphorus&#8208;heteroatom bonds and P&#8208;centered chirality are a promising class of functional building blocks for the design of chiral ligands and organocatalysts. A route to enantiomerically pure primary aminophosphine sulfides was opened through stereospecific reductive C&#8722;N bond cleavage of phosphorus(V) precursors by lithium in liquid ammonia. The chemoselectivity of the reaction as a function of reaction time, substrate pattern, and chiral auxiliary was investigated. In the presence of exclusively aliphatic groups bound to the phosphorus atom, all competing reductive side reactions are totally prevented. The absolute configurations of all P&#8208;stereogenic compounds were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Their use as synthetic building blocks was demonstrated. The lithium salt of (R)&#8208;BINOL&#8208;dithiophosphoric acid proved to be a useful stereochemical probe to determine the enantiomeric purity. Insights into the coordination mode of the lithium&#8208;based chiral complex formed in solution was provided by NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations.

         <title>Oxidation of an Internal&#8208;Edge&#8208;Substituted [5]Helicene&#8208;Derived Phosphine Synchronously Enhances Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Laterally &#960;&#8208;extended 7,8&#8208;dihydro[5]helicenes bearing phosphine and phosphine oxide groups on their inner helical rims were synthesized, and their photophysical and chiroptical properties were analyzed. As expected, the phosphine oxide showed a markedly enhanced circularly polarized luminescence response compared with that of the corresponding phosphine.







Abstract
Small chiral organic molecules with CD properties are in high demanded due to their potential use in promising electronic and biological applications. Herein, we reveal a system in which the oxidation of a phosphino group to the corresponding phosphine oxide on the inner rim of a helicene derivative induces a CPL response. Laterally &#960;&#8208;extended 7,8&#8208;dihydro[5]helicenes bearing phosphine and phosphine oxide groups on their inner helical rims (i.&#8201;e., the C1 position) were synthesized, and their helical structures were unambiguously determined by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The photophysical (UV/visible and emission) and chiroptical properties of these compounds were investigated in various solvents. Despite their structural similarities, phosphine oxide showed a significantly better CPL response than phosphine, with a high dissymmetry factor for emission (|glum|=(1.3&#8211;1.9)&#215;10&#8722;3) that can be attributed to structural changes in the interior of the helicene helix.

         <title>Isolation of Homo&#8208;/Mixed&#8208;Valence Ag12, Ag29, and Ag8 Clusters Stabilized by Cyclic Alkyl(amino) Carbene&#8208;Anchored Monoanionic Phosphorus Ligand</title>

         <dc:description>
Silver stableware: We have demonstrated the first syntheses and solid&#8208;state isolation of three unprecedented silver clusters [((cAAC)P)6Ag12Cl3](OTf)3 (1), [((cAAC)P)6Ag29] (2), and [((cAAC)P)4Ag8] (3) by employing cyclic alkyl(amino) carbene (cAAC)&#8208;supported phosphinidenide (cAACP&#8722;) generated in&#8197;situ as the stabilizing ligand from the corresponding phosphaalkene and potassium phosphinidenide, respectively.







Abstract
Silver clusters are attractive candidates for their promising optical properties, and biomedical activities. Herein, we report on the first syntheses and isolation of three homo&#8208;/mixed&#8208;valence silver nanoclusters (NCs) with Ag12Cl3, Ag29, and Ag8 cores [((cAAC)P)6Ag12Cl3](OTf)3 (1), [((cAAC)P)6Ag29] (2), and [((cAAC)P)4Ag8] (3) having three&#8208;/twofold symmetry, employing cyclic alkyl(amino) carbene (cAAC)&#8208;supported phosphinidenide (cAACP&#8722;) as the &#960;&#8208;accepting stabilizing ligand. The average diameters of Ag NCs 1, and 2 are approximately 1.6 to 2&#8197;nm. The redox non&#8208;innocent mono&#8208;atomic phosphorus anions (P&#8722;) anchored with cAAC ligands are generated in&#8197;situ by the reaction of AgOTf with a boryl&#8208;phosphaalkene (cAAC)P&#8722;B(NiPr2)2 through cleavage of the P&#8722;B bond with the help of a triflate anion (OTf&#8722;) as a weak nucleophile. Equivalent number of the (cAAC)P&#8722; anions generated in&#8197;situ are oxidized to produce the corresponding bis&#8208;phosphinidene (cAAC)2P2 leading to the generation of Ag0 ions in solution for the formation of the unprecedented mixed&#8208;valence Ag NC 2. Complex 3 is achieved by treating potassium phosphinidenide cAACPK with AgNTf2. The ligand field and the steric hindrance of the (cAAC)P units play crucial roles in stabilizing complexes 1&#8211;3, further providing a three&#8208; (1, 2)/two&#8208; (3) fold stand. The Ag12Cl3 NC (1) with a tricationic core [AgI12Cl3] was found to be diamagnetic, and fluorescent, emitting green light at 563&#8197;nm when excited at 400&#8197;nm. In contrast, the neutral Ag29 (2) and Ag8 (3) clusters were found to be paramagnetic, and NMR silent showing characteristic EPR signals for Ag0 at room temperature.

         <title>Microporous Framework (Nb, Fe)&#8208;Silicate with Much Potential to Remove Rare&#8208;Earth Elements from Waters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoparticles of a new small&#8208;pore metal silicate, Na2.9(Nb1.55Fe0.45)Si2O10&#8901;xH2O, have been synthesized under mild hydrothermal conditions. Replacement of the bulky Rb+ by smaller Na+ ions required stabilizing the framework via partial occupancy of the Nb5+ sites by Fe3+ ions. The material is stable up to almost 500&#8201;&#176;C. Ion exchange assays show its considerable potential to remove rare&#8208;earth elements from aqueous solutions.







Abstract
Nanoparticles of a new small&#8208;pore metal silicate formulated as Na2.9(Nb1.55Fe0.45)Si2O10&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xH2O and exhibiting the structure of previously reported Rb2(Nb2O4)(Si2O6)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O have been synthesized under mild hydrothermal conditions. Replacement of the bulky Rb+ by smaller Na+ ions was accomplished by stabilizing the framework structure via partial occupancy of the Nb5+ sites by Fe3+ ions. Exploratory ion&#8208;exchange assays evidence the considerable potential of this new silicate to remove rare&#8208;earth elements from aqueous solutions.

         <title>Butterfly&#8208;Shaped Nanographenes with Excellent Second Order Nonlinear Optical Properties: the Synergy of B/N and Azulene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Azulene, a simple polar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with connected electron donor and acceptor (DA), ignites the hope to design second order nonlinear optical (NLO) molecular materials from pure nonpolar carbon nanomaterials. In the present work, by incorporating azulene between two coronenes, a butterfly&#8208;shaped nanographene (&#960;&#8208;DA&#8208;&#960;) is designed. One more electron in a N atom or one less electron in a B atom with respect to a C atom can polarize charge distribution in carbon nanomaterials, and further doping of B and N in the designed butterfly&#8208;shaped nanographene change the system from &#960;&#8208;DA&#8208;&#960; to D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A, leading to strong NLO responses, e.g., the largest static first hyperpolarizability even reaches 173.89&#215;10&#8722;30 esu per heavy atom. The synergetic role of B, N and azulene in the nanographene is scrutinized, and such doping strategy provides an effective means for carbon&#8208;based functional materials design. The strong second order NLO responses of these butterfly&#8208;shaped carbon&#8208;based nanographenes under external fields, e.g., sum frequency generation and difference frequency generation, inspire future experimental exploration.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bimetallic transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) materials have emerged as attractive anodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) because of the high intrinsic electronic conductivity, rich redox sites and unique reaction mechanisms. In this work, we report the synthesis and electrochemical properties of a novel bimetallic TMCs material CuSbSe2. The as&#8208;prepared anode delivers a high reversible capacity of 545.6 mA h g&#8722;1 for SIBs and 592.6 mA h g&#8722;1 for LIBs at a current density of 0.2 A g&#8722;1, and an excellent rate capability of 425.9 mA h g&#8722;1 at 20 A g&#8722;1 for SIBs and 226.0 mA h g&#8722;1 at 10 A g&#8722;1 for LIBs without any common&#8208;used surface modification or carbonaceous compositing. In addition, ex situ XRD and HRTEM reveal a combined conversion&#8208;alloying reaction mechanism of LIBs and NIBs. Our findings suggest bimetallic CuSbSe2 anode could be a potential anode material for both SIBs and LIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalysed Carbene Transfer to Isocyanides as a Platform for Heterocycle Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An iron&#8208;catalysed carbene transfer reaction of diazo compounds to isocyanides is developed. The resulting ketenimines are trapped in situ with various bisnucleophiles to access a range of densely functionalized heterocycles (i.e., pyrimidinones, dihydropyrazolones, 1H&#8208;tetrazoles) in a one&#8208;pot process. The electron&#8208;rich Hieber anion ([Fe(CO)3NO]&#8722;) facilitates efficient catalytic carbene transfer from acceptor&#8208;type &#945;&#8208;diazo carbonyl compounds to isocyanides, providing a cost&#8208;efficient and benign alternative to similar noble metal&#8208;catalysed processes. Based on DFT calculations a plausible reaction mechanism for activation of the &#945;&#8208;diazo carbonyl carbene precursor and ketenimine formation is provided.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereodivergent Total Syntheses of (+)&#8208;Mycaperoxides C, D, G Methyl Ester and (&#8208;)&#8208;Mycaperoxide B</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mycaperoxides are natural endoperoxides isolated from different Mycale genus sponges, showing significant antiviral or antibacterial activities. We report herein the first total syntheses of representative congeners of this family from sclareol using a stereodivergent approach. Thus, an innovative oxidative ring expansion of cyclobutanol was used to bring the 1,2&#8208;dioxane subunit, and a Mukaiyama aldol reaction on peroxycarbenium species was utilized to install the propionic acid subunit. During the study toward (+)&#8208;mycaperoxide D methyl ester (2), the isolation of the eight possible diastereomers under their ethyl thioester form allowed us to build a pertinent database for further NMR assignment studies. Thus, we completed the total syntheses of (+)&#8208;mycaperoxides D, C, G methyl ester, and (&#8208;)&#8208;mycaperoxide B in 11 to 15 steps, confirming their original assignment.</dc:description>

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Luminescence Materials with Multiple Emission Colour and Near&#8208;Unity Quantum Yield</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing of solid luminescent materials with unity quantum yield and tunable emission color is promising, which is still a difficult task. Herein, a straightforward heat treatment method is developed to load 3, 4, 9, 10&#8208;perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) into the matrix of boric acid (BA), producing powders with a near&#8208;unity quantum yield and tunable emission color from yellow to green. Our results suggest that the emission of powder originates from PTCDA, and the tunable emission color is caused by the hydrolysis of PTCDA in the alkaline environment. The near&#8208;unity quantum yield is attributed to BA matrix, which provide confinement effect to PTCDA. In addition, the powder also shows excellent thermal stability, which allows its applications in light&#8208;emitting diodes. Above results are important for the development of solid&#8208;state luminescent materials for various applications, and it also provide a clue to study the emission properties of luminescent materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Propeller, Linear, Cruciform &amp; Stellate Spirobicarbazolium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A general synthetic approach of substituted tetraaryl&#8208;ammonium salts has been developed and illustrated crystallographically. Halo derivatives&#160;  1  m/p  &#8208;X  &#160;to&#160;  4  m/p  &#8208;X  &#160;(X =F, Cl, Br)&#160; being used as common synthetic intermediates. Suzuki coupling of these bromides with a family of boronic acids provided a&#160;reduction&#160;to practice of this strategy for arylation. Resolution of the C  2  &#160;subset&#160;  2*   m/p  &#8208;R  &#160; led to the first examples of enantiopure spirobicarbazoliums and the assignment of their absolute configuration by comparison of computational and experimental ECD spectra. An ECD comparison with Prelog&#8217;s spirobifluorenes is provided. In the case of&#160;  2*  m  &#8208;Br  , absolute configuration was confirmed by anomalous scattering. Cruciform and stellate tetra&#8208;substituted salts&#160;  4   m/p  &#8208;X  &#160;provide a test of the limits of the methodology and their structures suggest them as candidates for MOF building blocks.</dc:description>

         <title>Long&#8208;Term, Single&#8208;Molecule Imaging of Proteins in Live Cells with Photoregulated Fluxional Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational tuning of molecular properties delivered fluxional fluorophores that blink spontaneously upon photoisomerization. The compatibility of these probes with the self&#8208;labeling protein HaloTag enabled single&#8208;molecule imaging of specific molecular targets in live cells for exceptionally long periods of time.







Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) can reveal nanometric details of biological samples, but its high phototoxicity hampers long&#8208;term imaging in live specimens. A significant part of this phototoxicity stems from repeated irradiations that are necessary for controlled switching of fluorophores to maintain the sparse labeling of the sample. Lower phototoxicity can be obtained using fluorophores that blink spontaneously, but controlling the density of single&#8208;molecule emitters is challenging. We recently developed photoregulated fluxional fluorophores (PFFs) that combine the benefits of spontaneously blinking dyes with photocontrol of emitter density. These dyes, however, were limited to imaging acidic organelles in live cells. Herein, we report a systematic study of PFFs that culminates in probes that are functional at physiological pH and operate at longer wavelengths than their predecessors. Moreover, these probes are compatible with HaloTag labeling, thus enabling timelapse, single&#8208;molecule imaging of specific protein targets for exceptionally long times.

         <title>Catalytic Nitrene Transfer by an FeIV&#8208;Imido Complex Generated by a Comproportionation Process</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An FeIV imide of a tetracarbene macrocycle active in nitrene transfer reactions can be generated from phenyltosyliodinane (PhI=NTs) either from the FeII precursor by oxidative addition (right) or from the FeIII precursor by a comproportionation reaction (left) (AN=acetonitrile, bold horizontal bars=macrocycle).







Abstract
Nitrene transfer reactions have emerged as one of the most powerful and versatile ways to insert an amine function to various kinds of hydrocarbon substrates. However, the mechanisms of nitrene generation have not been studied in depth albeit their formation is taken for granted in most cases without definitive evidence of their occurrence. In the present work, we compare the generation of tosylimido iron species and NTs transfer from FeII and FeIII precursors where the metal is embedded in a tetracarbene macrocycle. Catalytic nitrene transfer to reference substrates (thioanisole, styrene, ethylbenzene and cyclohexane) revealed that the same active species was at play, irrespective of the ferrous versus ferric nature of the precursor. Through combination of spectroscopic (UV&#8208;visible, M&#246;ssbauer), ESI&#8208;MS and DFT studies, an FeIV tosylimido species was identified as the catalytically active species and was characterized spectroscopically and computationally. Whereas its formation from the FeII precursor was expected by a two&#8208;electron oxidative addition, its formation from an FeIII precursor was unprecedented. Thanks to a combination of spectroscopic (UV&#8208;visible, EPR, Hyscore and M&#246;ssbauer), ESI&#8208;MS and DFT studies, we found that, when starting from the FeIII precursor, an FeIII tosyliodinane adduct was formed and decomposed into an FeV tosylimido species which generated the catalytically active FeIV tosylimide through a comproportionation process with the FeIII precursor.

         <dc:description>
C&#8722;C cleavage to arylation. Enantioselective &#945;&#8208;arylation of simple aliphatic ketones has been achieved via chiral primary amine catalyzed asymmetric retro&#8208;Claisen cleavage involving &#946;&#8208;diketones and para&#8208;quinone monoimines that facilitates the construction of &#945;&#8208;aryl tertiary carbon stereocenters in good yields and high enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Highly enantioselective &#945;&#8208;arylation of simple ketones has been achieved by chiral primary amine catalyzed asymmetric retro&#8208;Claisen cleavage of &#946;&#8208;diketones. This mild organocatalytic strategy enables the construction of &#945;&#8208;aryl tertiary carbon stereocenters in good yields and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98&#8201;% ee) with the para&#8208;quinone monoimines as aryl sources. Furthermore, oxidative catalytic asymmetric &#945;&#8208;arylation has also been realized with free p&#8208;aminophenols.

         <title>Influence of Achiral Phosphine Ligands on a Synergistic Organo&#8208; and Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Allylic Alkylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the employment of synergistic amino&#8208; and palladium catalysis, an allylic alkylation is disclosed where all four stereoisomers can be accessed as the major product. Importantly, this stereodivergence has been developed to employ the aminocatalyst as the sole chiral reagent. While the aminocatalyst dictates the enantioselectivity, diastereoselectivity is governed by the nature of an achiral, monodentate phosphine ligand on palladium.







Abstract
An unusual diastereodivergent stereoselective allylation reaction is presented. It consists of a palladium&#8208;catalyzed allylation reaction of an organocatalytically generated amino isobenzofulvene, where the diastereoselectivity is controlled by the electronic properties of a monodentate, achiral ligand on palladium. One major diastereoisomer is formed using triarylphosphines substituted with neutral or electron&#8208;donating substituents of the aryl group, while those with electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents favor the other diastereoisomer. The diastereoselectivity correlates with the Taft inductive parameter of substituents on the triarylphosphine ligand on palladium. The synergistic reaction involves both a catalytic secondary amine catalyst for the indene&#8208;aldehyde activation and the monodentate phosphine ligands on palladium, affording a highly enantioselective reaction with up to 98&#8201;% enantiomeric excess. Based on computational investigations, the role of the monodentate phosphine ligand on the diastereoselectivity is discussed.

         <title>Evolution of a Synthetic Strategy for Garsubellin A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective total synthesis of garsubellin&#8197;A establishes the absolute stereostructure of the plant&#8208;derived meroterpene that enhances the choline acetyltransferase enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. The 12&#8208;step, protecting group&#8208;free synthesis features the use of a 1,3&#8208;dithiolane for efficient construction of the bridged and fused ring system.







Abstract
Garsubellin&#8197;A is a thirty&#8208;carbon meroterpenoid capable of enhancing the enzyme choline acetyltransferase whose decreased level is associated with the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Due to the potentially useful biological activity along with the novel molecular architecture, this plant metabolite has remained a popular synthetic target. Herein we report a full account of our synthetic investigations that have led to the enantioselective total synthesis of garsubellin&#8197;A, establishing its absolute stereostructure. The protecting group&#8208;free, twelve&#8208;step synthetic route has enabled the syntheses of the natural (&#8722;)&#8208;garsubellin&#8197;A and its unnatural (+)&#8208;antipode.

         <title>Studies towards the Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Dictyoxetane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Hajos&#8208;Parrish ketone is used to prepare a key building block for the total synthesis of the marine natural product dictyoxetane in enantiopure form. A synthetic alternative to the Garst&#8208;Spencer furan annelation is developed, and the reactivity and diastereoselectivity of the resulting tetrasubstituted chiral furan in cycloaddition reactions towards an appropriately functionalised carbocyclic core of dictyoxetane are explored.







Abstract
The dolabellane&#8208;type diterpene dictyoxetane represents a significant challenge to synthetic organic chemistry. Methodology directed towards the total synthesis of naturally occurring (+)&#8208;dictyoxetane is reported. Catalytic asymmetric synthesis of the trans&#8208;hydrindane ring system is achieved through chemoselective deoxygenation of the Hajos&#8208;Parrish ketone. An alternative to the Garst&#8208;Spencer furan annulation is developed for the synthesis of a 2,5&#8208;dimethyl, tetrasubstituted furan, employing a tandem 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig alcohol to alkyne cyclisation/aromatisation reaction as a key step. The (4+3) cycloaddition reaction of an oxyallyl cation with a tetrasubstituted furan is established on a cyclohexanone&#8208;derived model system, and a range of related (4+3) cycloadditions investigated on a homochiral, trans&#8208;hydrindane&#8208;fused furan, where regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity is required for the natural product synthesis. In an alternative (4+2) Diels&#8208;Alder approach, a C2&#8208;symmetric vinyl sulfoxide&#8208;based chiral ketene equivalent is used to prepare oxanorbornenes with the same oxygen bridge stereochemistry found in the 2,7&#8208;dioxatricyclo[4.2.1.03,8]nonane ring system of the natural product.

         <title>Theoretical and Experimental Investigation of Functionalized Cyanopyridines Yield an Anolyte with an Extremely Low Reduction Potential for Nonaqueous Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyanopyridines are reduced at low potentials in organic solvents and are therefore a promising class of molecules for anolytes for nonaqueous redox&#8208;flow batteries (RFBs). Quantum computations suggest that properly placed phenyl and methyl substituents shift the reduction potentials even lower than those of the parent cyanopyridines and prevent dimerization of the radical anions. The optimal molecule has a reduction potential in CH3CN of &#8722;2.50&#8197;V vs. Fc+/0, the lowest reported for a RFB anolyte.







Abstract
Cyanopyridines and cyanophenylpyridines were investigated as anolytes for nonaqueous redox flow batteries (RFBs). The three isomers of cyanopyridine are reduced at potentials of &#8722;2.2&#8197;V or lower vs. ferrocene+/0 (Fc+/0), but the 3&#8208;CNPy&#8901;&#8722; radical anion forms a sigma&#8208;dimer that is re&#8208;oxidized at E&#8776;&#8722;1.1&#8197;V, which would lead to poor voltaic efficiency in a RFB. Bulk electrochemical charge&#8208;discharge cycling of the cyanopyridines in acetonitrile and 0.50&#8197;M [NBu4][PF6] shows that 2&#8208;CNPy and 4&#8208;CNPy lose capacity quickly under these conditions, due to irreversible chemical reaction/decomposition of the radical anions. Density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that adding a phenyl group to the cyanopyridines would, for some isomers, limit dimerization and improve the stability of the radical anions, while shifting their E1/2 only about +0.10&#8197;V relative to the parent cyanopyridines. Among the cyanophenylpyridines, 3&#8208;CN&#8208;6&#8208;PhPy and 3&#8208;CN&#8208;4&#8208;PhPy are the most promising as anolytes. They exhibit reversible reductions at E1/2=&#8722;2.19 and &#8722;2.22&#8197;V vs. ferrocene+/0, respectively, and retain about half of their capacity after 30&#8197;bulk charge&#8208;discharge cycles. An improved version of 3&#8208;CN&#8208;6&#8208;PhPy with three methyl groups (3&#8208;cyano&#8208;4&#8208;methyl&#8208;6&#8208;(3,5&#8208;dimethylphenyl)pyridine) has an extremely low reduction potential of &#8722;2.50&#8197;V vs. Fc+/0 (the lowest reported for a nonaqueous RFB anolyte) and loses only 0.21&#8201;% of capacity per cycle during charge&#8208;discharge cycling in acetonitrile.

The three isomers of cyanopyridine are reduced at potentials of &#8722;2.2&#8197;V or lower vs. ferrocene&lt;sup&gt;+/0&lt;/sup&gt; (Fc&lt;sup&gt;+/0&lt;/sup&gt;), but the 3-CNPy&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; radical anion forms a sigma-dimer that is re-oxidized at &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;&#8776;&#8722;1.1&#8197;V, which would lead to poor voltaic efficiency in a RFB. Bulk electrochemical charge-discharge cycling of the cyanopyridines in acetonitrile and 0.50&#8197;M [NBu&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;][PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] shows that 2-CNPy and 4-CNPy lose capacity quickly under these conditions, due to irreversible chemical reaction/decomposition of the radical anions. Density-functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that adding a phenyl group to the cyanopyridines would, for some isomers, limit dimerization and improve the stability of the radical anions, while shifting their &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; only about +0.10&#8197;V relative to the parent cyanopyridines. Among the cyanophenylpyridines, 3-CN-6-PhPy and 3-CN-4-PhPy are the most promising as anolytes. They exhibit reversible reductions at &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;=&#8722;2.19 and &#8722;2.22&#8197;V vs. ferrocene&lt;sup&gt;+/0&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, and retain about half of their capacity after 30&#8197;bulk charge-discharge cycles. An improved version of 3-CN-6-PhPy with three methyl groups (3-cyano-4-methyl-6-(3,5-dimethylphenyl)pyridine) has an extremely low reduction potential of &#8722;2.50&#8197;V vs. Fc&lt;sup&gt;+/0&lt;/sup&gt; (the lowest reported for a nonaqueous RFB anolyte) and loses only 0.21&#8201;% of capacity per cycle during charge-discharge cycling in acetonitrile.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Core/Shell Structure P Doped MoS2@Ni3S2 Nanorods Array for High Current Density Hydrogen Evolution in Alkaline and Acidic Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The P doped MoS2@Ni3S2 nanorods array with core/shell structure was prepared through successive sulfuration and phosphorization strategies, which exhibits close catalytic activity to Pt/C, the overpotential is only 290&#8197;mV at 250&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Electrocatalysis is the most promising strategy to generate clean energy H2, and the development of catalysts with excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance at high current density that can resist strong alkaline and acidic electrolyte environment is of great significance for practical industrial application. Therefore, a P doped MoS2@Ni3S2 nanorods array (named P&#8208;NiMoS) was successfully synthesized through successive sulfuration and phosphorization. P&#8208;NiMoS presents a core/shell structure with a heterojunction between MoS2 (shell) and Ni3S2 (core). Furthermore, the doping of P modulates the electronic structure of the P&#8208;NiMoS; the electrons transfer from the t2g orbital of Ni element to the eg empty orbital of Mo element through the Ni&#8722;S&#8722;Mo bond at the Ni3S2 and MoS2 heterojunction, facilitating the hydrogen evolution reaction. As a result, P&#8208;NiMoS exhibits excellent HER activity; the overpotential is 290&#8197;mV at high current density of 250&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline electrolyte, which is close to Pt/C (282&#8197;mV@250&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), and P&#8208;NiMoS can stably evolve hydrogen for 48&#8197;h.

         <title>Two 3D Rubidium Halide Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Perovskite Ferroelectrics Templated by Quasi&#8208;Spherical Organic Amine 1,4&#8208;Diazabicyclo[3.2.2]nonane</title>

         <dc:description>
Two 3D organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid ABX3 perovskite structures constructed with [RbX6] (X=Br, I) octahedra by sharing corner or face can accommodate the large spherical organic molecule 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[3.2.2]nonane using the different cavities in their inorganic frameworks.







Abstract
The emergence of (CH3NH3)PbI3 has brought the development of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite (OIHP) structures with ABX3 type to a higher level; however, most 3D frameworks are constructed by corner&#8208;sharing of BX6 octahedra. Herein, we substituted the spherical molecule 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (2.2.2&#8208;dabco) with 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[3.2.2]nonane (1,4&#8208;3.2.2&#8208;dabcn) as a template to react with RbX (X=Br, I) in the corresponding HX acids under the consideration of reducing the molecular symmetry. Two 3D OIHP compounds [1,4&#8208;3.2.2&#8208;H2dabcn]RbI3&#8901;H2O (1) and [1,4&#8208;3.2.2&#8208;H2dabcn]RbBr3 (2) crystallized in non&#8208;centrosymmetric point group mm2 before the phase transition point were isolated. Among them, the 3D inorganic framework of 1 is constructed by sharing the corner of [RbI6] octahedra, while that of 2 is constructed by sharing the corner and face of [RbBr6] octahedra to acquire large cavities to accommodate the organic amine cation [1,4&#8208;3.2.2&#8208;H2dabcn]2+; this 3D framework type is unprecedented in the OIHPs. As expected, compounds 1 and 2 exhibit reversible phase transition, dielectric and second harmonic generation (SHG) and ferroelectric properties, in which the phase transition temperature of 2 at 374&#8197;K is much higher than compound 1 at 280&#8197;K.

         <title>Recent Status and Developments of Vacancies Modulation in the ABO3 Perovskites for Catalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perovskite oxides (ABO3) have attracted comprehensive interest for wide range of functional applications (especially for chemical catalysis) due to their high design flexibility, controllable vacancies sites creation, abundant chemical properties, and stable crystal structure. Herein, the previous research and potential development of ABO3 through adjusting the vacancy at different sites (A&#8208;site, B&#8208;site, and O&#8208;site) to enhance catalytic performance are systematically analyzed and generalized. Briefly, the ABO3 with different vacancies sites prepared by multifarious direct and indirect methods, accompanied with the improved physical&#8208;chemical properties, endow them with distinct and intensified development of catalysis application. In addition, the impressive optimization proved by the vacancies sites adjustment over the ABO3 is studied to continuously facilitate the advance in some common catalysis reactions, further expanding to other optimized functional applications. At last, the constructive suggestions for fine regulation and analysis of vacancies sites over ABO3 are also put forward.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion&#8208;Driven Programmable Chiral Self&#8208;Sorting in Metal&#8208;Organic Cages and Structural Transformations between Heterochiral and Homochiral Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>When a racemic mixture of chiral building blocks self&#8208;assembles to form discrete molecular or supramolecular cages, the system can adopt either social or narcissistic chiral self&#8208;sorting. However, control over such chiral self&#8208;sorting is hard to achieve with a desired choice of outcome. Herein we report anion templated high&#8208;fidelity chiral self&#8208;sorting during the coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of [Pd2L4] metal&#8208;organic cages, with a racemic mixture of an axially chiral ligand. Upon varying the counter&#8208;anions, the outcome of the choice of chiral self&#8208;sorting, whether social or narcissistic, leading to kinetically favored heterochiral or thermodynamically favored homochiral cages, can be controlled through specific anion encapsulation. Non&#8208;encapsulating anion afforded a mixture of all possible diastereomers. Anion exchange enabled structural transformations between the diastereomers and the conversion of the mixture of diastereomers into homochiral diastereomers.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>p&#8208;Cymene ruthenium(II) complex is one of the most widely used catalysts in C&#8208;H activation. However, enantioselective C&#8208;H activation promoted by arene ruthenium(II) complexes has not been realized until recently. The revealed strategies include use of intramolecular nitrene C&#8211;H insertion, chiral transient directing group, chiral carboxylic acid, relay catalysis, and chiral arene ligands. In this minireview, these advances are summarized and discussed in hope of spurring further developments.</dc:description>

         <title>Substituent Effects in Iron Porphyrin Catalysts for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For a future hydrogen economy, non&#8209;precious metal catalysts for the water splitting reactions are needed that can be implemented on a global scale. Metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (MNC) catalysts with active sites constituting a metal center with fourfold coordination of nitrogen (MN4) show promising performance, but an optimization rooted in structure&#8209;property relationships has been hampered by their low structural definition. Porphyrin model complexes are studied to transfer insights from well&#8208;defined molecules to MNC systems. This work combines experiment and theory to evaluate the influence of porphin substituents on the electronic and electrocatalytic properties of MN4 centers with respect to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in aqueous electrolyte. We found that the choice of substituent affects their utilization on the carbon support and their electrocatalytic performance. We propose an HER mechanism for supported iron porphyrin complexes involving a [FeII(P&#9642;)]&#8208; radical anion intermediate, in which a porphinic nitrogen atom acts as an internal base. While this work focuses on the HER, the limited influence of a simultaneous interaction with the support and an aqueous electrolyte will likely be transferrable to other catalytic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>CO2 Laser&#8208;Induced Graphene with an Appropriate Oxygen Species as an Efficient Electrocatalyst for Hydrogen Peroxide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 60, October 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomass&#8208;based graphene with active oxygen species is rapidly fabricated by a CO2 laser method. The laser&#8208;induced graphene shows a high catalytic performance in 2 e&#8722; oxygen reduction reactions to synthesize H2O2 including high Faraday efficiency (over 78&#8201;%) and mass activity (814&#8197;mmolgcatalyst&#8722;1&#8197;h&#8722;1) in alkaline solution, superior to most of the reported carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts. As demonstrated by density function theory simulations, the high catalytic sites are attributed to the meta&#8208;C atoms with charge accumulation at nearby C&#8722;O and O&#8722;C=O species.







Abstract
Oxygen species functionalized graphene (O&#8722;G) is an effective electrocatalyst for electrochemically synthesizing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by a 2 e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The type of oxygen species and degree of carbon crystallinity in O&#8722;G are two key factors for the high catalytic performance of the 2 e&#8722; ORR. However, the general preparing method of O&#8722;G by the precursor of graphite has the disadvantages of consuming massive strong oxidant and washing water. Herein, the biomass&#8208;based graphene with tunable oxygen species is rapidly fabricated by a CO2 laser. In a flow cell setup, the laser&#8208;induced graphene (LIG) with abundant active oxygen species and graphene structure shows high catalytic performance including high Faraday efficiency (over 78&#8201;%) and high mass activity (814&#8197;mmolgcatalyst&#8722;1&#8197;h&#8722;1), superior to most of the reported carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Density function theory demonstrates the meta&#8208;C atoms at nearby C&#8722;O, O&#8722;C=O species are the key catalytic sites. Therefore, we develop one facile method to rapidly convert biomass to graphene electrocatalyst used for H2O2 synthesis.

         <title>Chemo&#8208; and Site&#8208;Selective Electro&#8208;Oxidative Alkane Fluorination by C(sp3)&#8722;H Cleavage</title>

         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;free electrochemical C(sp3)&#8722;H fluorination was accomplished without the requirement for directing groups and electrophilic fluorine sources, featuring high levels of site&#8208; and chemoselectivity.







Abstract
Electrochemical fluorinations of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds with a nucleophilic fluoride source have been accomplished in a chemo&#8208; and site&#8208;selective fashion, avoiding the use of electrophilic F+ sources and stoichiometric oxidants. The introduced metal&#8208;free strategy exhibits high functional group tolerance, setting the stage for late&#8208;stage fluorinations of biorelevant motifs. The synthetic utility of the C(sp3)&#8722;H fluorination was reflected by subsequent one&#8208;pot arylation of the generated benzylic fluorides.

         <title>Controlling Electronic Events Through Rational Structural Design in Subphthalocyanine&#8211;Corrole Dyads: Synthesis, Characterization, and Photophysical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 60, October 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of covalently linked subphthalocyanine&#8211;corrole (SubPc&#8208;Cor) dyads have been prepared. In four of the reported examples, Cor&#8901;+&#8208;SubPc&#8901;&#8722; charge&#8208;separated states have been observed, whereas in the case of the electron&#8208;rich SubPc and the electron&#8208;deficient Cor dyad, only energy transfer has been detected.







Abstract
Porphyrinoids are considered perfect candidates for their incorporation into electron donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) arrays due to their remarkable optoelectronic properties and low reorganization energies. For the first time, a series of subphthalocyanine (SubPc) and corrole (Cor) were covalently connected through a short&#8208;range linkage. SubPc axial substitution strategies were employed, which allowed the synthesis of the target molecules in decent yields. In this context, a qualitative synthetic approach was performed to reverse the expected direction of the different electronic events. Consequently, in&#8208;depth absorption, fluorescence, and electrochemical assays enabled the study of electronic and photophysical properties. Charge separation was observed in cases of electron&#8208;donating Cors, whereas a quantitative energy transfer from the Cor to the SubPc was detected in the case of electron accepting Cors.

         <title>Cationic Gold(II) Complexes: Experimental and Theoretical Study
</title>

Gilded gases: Gold(II) complexes are rare, and a little is known about their properties. We have generated gaseous gold(II) halido complexes from their gold(III) precursors with various auxiliary ligands and investigated them by helium&#8208;tagging infrared and visible photodissociation spectroscopy. The structure of the complexes was described by DFT calculations benchmarked by comparison with the experimental data.







Abstract
Gold(II) complexes are rare, and their application to the catalysis of chemical transformations is underexplored. The reason is their easy oxidation or reduction to more stable gold(III) or gold(I) complexes, respectively. We explored the thermodynamics of the formation of [AuII(L)(X)]+ complexes (L=ligand, X=halogen) from the corresponding gold(III) precursors and investigated their stability and spectral properties in the IR and visible range in the gas phase. The results show that the best ancillary ligands L for stabilizing gaseous [AuII(L)(X)]+ complexes are bidentate and tridentate ligands with nitrogen donor atoms. The electronic structure and spectral properties of the investigated gold(II) complexes were correlated with quantum chemical calculations. The results show that the molecular and electronic structure of the gold(II) complexes as well as their spectroscopic properties are very similar to those of analogous stable copper(II) complexes.

         <title>Two Paths to Oxidative C&#8722;H Amination Under Basic Conditions: A Theoretical Case Study Reveals Hidden Opportunities Provided by Electron Upconversion

Exploring the possibilities of an odd&#8208;electron bond formation under basic and oxidative conditions in silico: How radical&#8208;anion bond formation and electron upconversion allow for milder oxidative conditions.







Abstract
Traditionally, cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) leads to C&#8722;N bond formation under basic and oxidative conditions and is proposed to proceed via a two&#8208;electron bond formation mediated by carbenium ions. However, the formation of such high&#8208;energy intermediates is only possible in the presence of strong oxidants, which may lead to undesired side reactions and poor functional group tolerance. In this work we explore if oxidation under basic conditions allows the formation of three&#8208;electron bonds (resulting in &#8220;upconverted&#8221; highly&#8208;reducing radical&#8208;anions). The benefit of this &#8220;upconversion&#8221; process is in the ability to use milder oxidants (e.&#8201;g., O2) and to avoid high&#8208;energy intermediates. Comparison of the two&#8208; and three&#8208;electron pathways using quantum mechanical calculations reveals that not only does the absence of a strong oxidant shut down two&#8208;electron pathways in favor of a three&#8208;electron path but, paradoxically, weaker oxidants react faster with the upconverted reductants by avoiding the inverted Marcus region for electron transfer.

Effective method for TfOH&#8208;catalyzed construction of spiroindanes and spirotetralines containing an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter was developed, and the reaction was applied to the first total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;misrametine.







Abstract
An effective method was developed for TfOH&#8208;catalyzed construction of spiroindanes and spirotetralines containing an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter. Intramolecular Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;type 1,4&#8208;addition of the substrates which were di&#8208; or trimethoxybenzene and 2&#8208;cyclohexenone linked by an alkyl chain proceeded smoothly in the presence of 30&#8197;mol&#8201;% of TfOH. A variety of spiroindanes and spirotetralines were obtained with moderate to excellent yield by this method. The reaction was successfully applied in the first total synthesis of the unusual proaporphine alkaloid (&#177;)&#8208;misrametine, which included the gram&#8208;scale spirocyclization and selective O&#8208;demethylation used KCN in DMSO condition as key steps.

Unchaining ways: Ethylene&#8208;coordinative chain&#8208;transfer polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly is performed by chain extending poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;butadiene) living chains in toluene in the presence of ethylene and a Nd&#8208;based catalyst.







Abstract
Block copolymers based on ethylene (E) and butadiene (B) were prepared using the ansa&#8208;bis(fluorenyl) complex {Me2Si(C13H8)2Nd(BH4)2Li(THF)}2 in combination with (n&#8208;Bu)(n&#8208;Oct)Mg (BOMAG) as a chain&#8208;transfer agent. The diblock copolymers incorporating a soft poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;butadiene) segment, called ethylene butadiene rubber (EBR), and a hard polyethylene (PE) one were obtained by simply adjusting the different feeds of monomers during the polymerization. The soluble EBR block was formed first by feeding the catalytic system dissolved in toluene at 70&#8201;&#176;C with a mixture of ethylene and butadiene (E/B molar ratio 80&#8201;:&#8201;20). Then the feeding was stopped leading to the consumption of a large part of the residual monomers. The reactor was finally fed with ethylene to form the PE block. By varying the molar mass of the latter, it is shown that the resulting soft&#8208;b&#8208;hard block copolymers can self&#8208;assemble simultaneously to the growth of the PE block in agreement with a polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) mechanism. The self&#8208;assembly is discussed considering the reaction conditions, the crystallization of the PE block, and the polymerization mechanism involved.

         <title>Catalysis by [Ga4L6]12&#8722; Metallocage on the Nazarov Cyclization: The Basicity of Complexed Alcohol is Key</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 60, October 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Nazarov cyclization process performed inside a metallocage is much faster than in solution. This is mainly due to the change of basicity of the substrate (an alcohol) once encapsulated.







Abstract
The Nazarov cyclization is investigated in solution and within K12[Ga4L6] supramolecular organometallic cage by means of computational methods. The reaction needs acidic condition in solution but works at neutral pH in the presence of the metallocage. The reaction steps for the process are analogous in both media: (a) protonation of the alcohol group, (b) water loss and (c) cyclization.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Nazarov cyclization&lt;/b&gt; process performed inside a metallocage is much faster than in solution. This is mainly due to the change of basicity of the substrate (an alcohol) once encapsulated.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nazarov cyclization is investigated in solution and within K&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;[Ga&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] supramolecular organometallic cage by means of computational methods. The reaction needs acidic condition in solution but works at neutral pH in the presence of the metallocage. The reaction steps for the process are analogous in both media: (a) protonation of the alcohol group, (b) water loss and (c) cyclization. The relative Gibbs energies of all the steps are affected by changing the environment from solvent to the metallocage. The first step in the mechanism, the alcohol protonation, turns out to be the most critical one for the acceleration of the reaction inside the metallocage. In order to calculate the relative stability of protonated alcohol inside the cavity, we propose a computational scheme for the calculation of basicity for species inside cavities and can be of general use. These results are in excellent agreement with the experiments, identifying key steps of catalysis and providing an in-depth understanding of the impact of the metallocage on all the reaction steps.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantiodivergent Chemoenzymatic Dynamic Kinetic Resolution: Conversion of Racemic Propargyl Alcohols into Both Enantiomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 60, October 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Choosing the outcome: A silyl group at the alkyne terminal of secondary propargyl alcohols temporarily inverted the enantio&#8208;recognition of natural lipases. Using this phenomenon, the lipase/oxovanadium co&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of racemic alcohols achieved enantiodivergent production of R and S enantiomers in high yield and with high enantiomeric excess.







Abstract
Natural lipases typically recognize enantiomers of alcohols based on the size differences of substituents near the carbinol moiety and selectively react with the R enantiomers of secondary alcohols. Therefore, lipase&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of racemic secondary alcohols produces only R enantiomers. We report herein a method for obtaining S enantiomers by DKR of secondary 3&#8208;(trialkylsilyl)propargyl alcohols by using a well&#8208;known R&#8208;selective Pseudomonas fluorescens lipase in combination with a racemization catalyst VMPS4, in which the silyl group reverses the size relationship of substituents near the carbinol moiety. We have already reported R&#8208;selective DKR of the corresponding propargyl alcohols without substituents on the ethynyl terminal carbon, and the presence of an easily removable silyl group has enabled us to produce both enantiomers of propargyl alcohols in high chemical yields and with high enantiomeric excess. In addition, immobilization of the lipase on Celite was found to be important for achieving a high efficiency of the DKR.

         <title>Interplay and Competition Between Two Different Types of Redox&#8208;Active Ligands in Cobalt Complexes: How to Allocate the Electrons?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 60, October 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular transition metal complexes with two different types of redox&#8208;active ligands are uncommon. Herein, the synthesis of the first mono&#8208; and dinuclear cobalt complexes is reported which exhibit redox&#8208;active oxolene&#8208;type ligands in combination with redox&#8208;active bisguanidine/urea azine ligands, representing four or six center redox systems. Radical ligands are present in all complexes; the differences in the electronic structures lead to characteristic magnetic and optical properties.







Abstract
The field of molecular transition metal complexes with redox&#8208;active ligands is dominated by compounds with one or two units of the same redox&#8208;active ligand; complexes in which different redox&#8208;active ligands are bound to the same metal are uncommon. This work reports the first molecular coordination compounds in which redox&#8208;active bisguanidine or urea azine (biguanidine) ligands as well as oxolene ligands are bound to the same cobalt atom. The combination of two different redox&#8208;active ligands leads to mono&#8208; as well as unprecedented dinuclear cobalt complexes, being multiple (four or six) center redox systems with intriguing electronic structures, all exhibiting radical ligands. By changing the redox potential of the ligands through derivatisation, the electronic structure of the complexes could be altered in a rational way.

Compounds showing efficient phosphorescence in violet range are now very scarce. Herein, we have designed and synthesized original trigonal planar Au@Ag3 clusters exhibiting bright solid&#8208;state phosphorescence in violet to deep&#8208;blue range (&#955;max=410&#8211;442&#8197;nm) with very high radiative rates of around 106&#8197;s&#8722;1 and up to 96&#8201;% quantum efficiency at ambient temperature.

We report here a series of original ligand&#8208;supported trigonal planar Au@Ag3 clusters exhibiting bright solid&#8208;state phosphorescence in violet to deep&#8208;blue range (&#955;max=410&#8211;442&#8197;nm) with remarkably short decay times (0.36&#8211;1.36&#8197;&#956;s) and up to 96&#8201;% emission quantum yield at 298&#8197;K.

         <title>High&#8208;fidelity Recognition of Organotrifluoroborate Anions (R&#8722;BF3&#8722;) as Designer Guest Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 60, October 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic trifluoroborate anions (R&#8722;BF3&#8722;) are found to be competent size&#8208;matched binding partners for cyanostar macrocycles. Binding involves the BF3&#8722; headgroups and is modulated by the sterics of the substituent. Small vinyl and methyl substituents bind equally well and lay a foundation for the guest&#8208;design of self&#8208;assembled architectures.







Abstract
The recognition of boron compounds is well developed as boronic acids but untapped as organotrifluoroborate anions (R&#8722;BF3&#8722;). We are exploring the development of these and other designer anions as anion&#8208;recognition motifs by considering them as substituted versions of the parent inorganic ion. To this end, we demonstrate strong and reliable binding of organic trifluoroborates, R&#8722;BF3&#8722;, by cyanostar macrocycles that are size&#8208;complementary to the inorganic BF4&#8722; progenitors. We find that recognition is modulated by the substituent's sterics and that the affinities are retained using the common K+ salts of R&#8722;BF3&#8722; anions.

         <title>Improving the Electrocatalytic Activity of a Nickel&#8208;Organic Framework toward the Oxygen Evolution Reaction through Vanadium Doping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 60, October 26, 2022. </description>

The spherical structure V&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;MOF was successfully constructed on nickel foam by a facile two&#8208;step hydrothermal method. The V0.09&#8722;Ni0.91MOF/NF catalyst demonstrates extraordinary OER performance in alkaline. Studies showed that the three&#8208;dimensional structure of V&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;MOF/NF can provide more catalytically active sites and adjust the binding energy with intermediates, thereby enhancing the OER catalytic activity.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been considered as potential oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts owning to their ultra&#8208;thin structure, adjustable composition, high surface area, and high porosity. Here, we designed and fabricated a vanadium&#8208;doped nickel organic framework (V1&#8722;x&#8722;NixMOF) system by using a facile two&#8208;step solvothermal method on nickel foam (NF). The doping of vanadium remarkably elevates the OER activity of V1&#8722;x&#8722;NixMOF, thus demonstrating better performance than the corresponding single metallic Ni&#8208;MOF, NiV&#8208;MOF and RuO2 catalysts at high current density (&gt;400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). V0.09&#8722;Ni0.91MOF/NF provides a low overpotential of 235&#8197;mV and a small Tafel slope of 30.3&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. More importantly, a water&#8208;splitting device assembled with Pt/C/NF and V0.09&#8722;Ni0.91MOF/NF as cathode and anode yielded a cell voltage of 1.96&#8197;V@1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, thereby outperforming the&#8208;state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art RuO2(+)||Pt/C(&#8722;). Our work sheds new insight on preparing stable, efficient OER electrocatalysts and a promising method for designing various MOF&#8208;based materials.

         <title>Fe&#8208;Catalyzed Amidation of Allylic Alcohols by Borrowing Hydrogen Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 60, October 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The amidation of allylic alcohols with chiral tert&#8208;butylsulfinamide catalyzed by an Earth&#8208;abundant Fe complex via a borrowing hydrogen pathway has been developed. With water as the only by&#8208;product, a range of synthetically useful chiral sulfinamide olefin derivatives were obtained under mild reaction conditions with exclusive linear selectivity and retention of enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Allylic amines are useful building blocks in organic synthesis, so the development of green and efficient methods for the preparation of allylic amines are of great importance. An Fe&#8208;catalyzed amidation of allylic alcohols with chiral tert&#8208;butylsulfinamide has been developed. With water as the only by&#8208;product, a range of synthetically useful chiral sulfinamide olefin derivatives (30 examples) were obtained under mild reaction conditions. The reaction can be performed on a gram&#8208;scale, and the products could serve as chiral ligands for asymmetric catalysis. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction proceeds by an Fe&#8208;catalyzed borrowing hydrogen process, which is different from most of the reported allylic amination reactions.

         <title>Rational Tuning of the Reactivity of Three&#8208;Membered Heterocycle Ring Openings via SN2 Reactions</title>

It's a trap! Our quantum chemical analyses reveal that ring&#8208;opening reaction barriers decrease in the order aziridines&gt;phosphiranes&gt;epoxides&gt;thiiranes, and thus do not simply follow the order of C&#8722;Y leaving&#8208;group bond strength. We illustrate that orbital interaction (HOMONu&#8211;LUMOSubstrate is an all&#8208;important factor for these reactions. The high reactivity of aziridines and phosphiranes substituted with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups is mainly caused by a diminished steric repulsion between the reactants.







Abstract
The development of small&#8208;molecule covalent inhibitors and probes continuously pushes the rapidly evolving field of chemical biology forward. A key element in these molecular tool compounds is the &#8220;electrophilic trap&#8221; that allows a covalent linkage with the target enzyme. The reactivity of this entity needs to be well balanced to effectively trap the desired enzyme, while not being attacked by off&#8208;target nucleophiles. Here we investigate the intrinsic reactivity of substrates containing a class of widely used electrophilic traps, the three&#8208;membered heterocycles with a nitrogen (aziridine), phosphorus (phosphirane), oxygen (epoxide) or sulfur atom (thiirane) as heteroatom. Using quantum chemical approaches, we studied the conformational flexibility and nucleophilic ring opening of a series of model substrates, in which these electrophilic traps are mounted on a cyclohexene scaffold (C6H10Y with Y=NH, PH, O, S). It was revealed that the activation energy of the ring opening does not necessarily follow the trend that is expected from C&#8722;Y leaving&#8208;group bond strength, but steeply decreases from Y=NH, to PH, to O, to S. We illustrate that the HOMONu&#8211;LUMOSubstrate interaction is an all&#8208;important factor for the observed reactivity. In addition, we show that the activation energy of aziridines and phosphiranes can be tuned far below that of the corresponding epoxides and thiiranes by the addition of proper electron&#8208;withdrawing ring substituents. Our results provide mechanistic insights to rationally tune the reactivity of this class of popular electrophilic traps and can guide the experimental design of covalent inhibitors and probes for enzymatic activity.

         <title>Dihydrogen Activation with a Neutral, Intermolecular Silicon(IV)&#8208;Amine Frustrated Lewis Pair</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 60, October 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silicon Lewis superacid with a novel perfluorinated ortho&#8208;aminophenol ligand is designed and used in FLP type H2 activation, enabling for the first time the formation of an hydridosilicate directly from H2. The narrow choice of the Lewis base and the reaction conditions emphasize the commonly encountered difficulties in this challenging hallmark FLP reaction.







Abstract
The heterolytic cleavage of dihydrogen constitutes the hallmark reaction of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLP). While being well&#8208;established for planar Lewis acids, such as boranes or silylium ions, the observation of the primary H2 splitting products with non&#8208;planar Lewis acid FLPs remained elusive. In the present work, we report bis(perfluoro&#8208;N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;ortho&#8208;amidophenolato)silane and its application in dihydrogen activation to a fully characterized hydridosilicate. The strict design of the Lewis acid, the limited selection of the Lewis base, and the distinct reaction conditions emphasize the narrow tolerance to achieve this fascinating process with a tetrahedral Lewis acid.

DFT calculations provide valuable insights into the mechanism of the oxy&#8208;arylation/vinylation of akenes catalyzed by gold. The way alkenols coordinate to (MeDalphos)Au(R&#8217;)2+ (R&#8217;=phenyl, vinyl) was found to significantly depend on their substitution pattern (terminal, Z/E internal) and to play a major role in the 5&#8208;exo/6&#8208;endo regioselectivity.







Abstract
The mechanism of oxy&#8208;arylation/vinylation of alkenes catalyzed by the (MeDalphos)AuCl complex was comprehensively investigated by DFT. (P,N)Au(Ph)2+ and (P,N)Au(vinyl)2+ are key intermediates accounting for the activation of the alkenols and for their cyclization by outer&#8208;sphere nucleophilic attack of oxygen. The 5&#8208;exo and 6&#8208;endo paths have been computed and compared, reproducing the peculiar regioselectivity difference observed experimentally between 4&#8208;penten&#8208;1&#8208;ol, (E) and (Z)&#8208;4&#8208;hexen&#8208;1&#8208;ols. Examining the way the alkenol coordinates to gold (more &#951;2 or &#951;1) can offer, in some cases, a simple way to predict the favored path of cyclization.

         <title>Construction of C&#8208;N Atropisomers by Aminocatalytic Enantioselective Addition of Indole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxaldehydes to o&#8208;Quinone Derivatives</title>

You (don't) spin me right &#8216;round, baby, right &#8216;round. A new organocatalytic atroposelective method for the construction of C&#8722;N atropisomers is presented. The newly developed F&#8208;substituted aminocatalyst, with an increased outer&#8208;sphere steric control, enables the atroposelective formation of the desired product, which feature interesting biological motifs.







Abstract
The first atroposelective aminocatalytic methodology for the construction of C&#8722;N atropisomers is presented. The synthesis of this class of axially chiral molecules typically encompasses substrates in which the C&#8722;N bond is pre&#8208;formed. In contrast, this work presents the direct coupling of indole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxaldehydes to ortho&#8208;quinones, to form the stereogenic C&#8722;N axis in an atroposelective way. Application of typical secondary amine catalysts furnished the desired product, however, in low yields and as a complex mixture arising from poor regiocontrol among the C3&#8208; and N1&#8208;sites of the indole core. A new aminocatalyst was designed and synthesized with increased outer&#8208;sphere steric bulk to address these challenges thereby providing good levels of regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity. A novel library of functionalized and enantioenriched C&#8722;N atropisomers was obtained and their synthetic utility was demonstrated by various transformations.

Eu&#8208;ETTB and Gd&#8208;ETTB were obtained with the same topology by self&#8208;assembly. Both materials showed extremely high proton conductivity: the proton conductivity of Eu&#8208;ETTB was 1.53&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 98&#8201;% relative humidity (RH) and 85&#8201;&#176;C, while Gd&#8208;ETTB had a proton conductivity value of 2.63&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 98&#8201;% RH and 75&#8201;&#176;C. Furthermore, both materials had excellent performance both in terms of stability and durability.







Abstract
In this work, the two example rare earth&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (LaIII&#8208;based MOFs), Eu&#8208;ETTB and Gd&#8208;ETTB, were obtained by self&#8208;assembly. Both materials showed extremely high proton conductivity, with the proton conductivity of Eu&#8208;ETTB being 1.53&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 98&#8201;% relative humidity (RH) and 85&#8201;&#176;C and that of Gd&#8208;ETTB being 2.63&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 98&#8201;% RH and 75&#8201;&#176;C. This was almost the best performance observed for three&#8208;dimensional porous MOFs without post&#8208;synthetic modification and was based on milder conditions than for most materials. Furthermore, cycle test experiments and continuous work tests showed that both materials had excellent performance both in terms of stability and durability. Water vapor adsorption experiments showed that a large number of water molecules are adsorbed the hydrogen&#8208;bond network's being rebuilt by the adsorbed water molecules in the pore channel and thus optimizing the channels for proton transfer explained the MOF's high performance.

f&#8208;Block elements exhibit unique coordination chemistry in molten salts, which arouse increasing research efforts due to the demands for separation and recovery of these elements via molten salt&#8208;based pyrochemical approaches. Although challenging, with the assistance of advanced high&#8208;temperature characterization techniques and theoretical calculations, coordination behaviors of f&#8208;block elements, such as chemical species, coordination structures, and their evolutions in molten salt, can be understood in a clearer manner.

         <dc:description>
Eu&#8208;ETTB and Gd&#8208;ETTB were obtained by self&#8208;assembly; their three&#8208;dimensional frameworks provide a channel for proton conduction. Under high humidity, water molecules are adsorbed in the channel and form complex hydrogen bond networks, shown as lightning. Astronauts moving easily along the channel represent the effective transport of protons: proton conductivity reached a maximum value of 2.63&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1. More information can be found in the Research Article by L. Du, Q.&#8208;H. Zhao, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202154).

         <title>Cover Feature: Enantiodivergent Chemoenzymatic Dynamic Kinetic Resolution: Conversion of Racemic Propargyl Alcohols into Both Enantiomers (Chem. Eur. J. 60/2022)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 60, October 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for enantiodivergent production of S and R propargylic alcohols from their racemates by using commercial lipase&#8208;based dynamic kinetic resolution achieves quantitative conversion of the racemates into optically pure substances. The right and left hands, wearing jeweled rings indicating individual reaction steps, lead to opposite enantioselection, producing S and R alcohols, respectively. The order of the jewels is key to the enantioswitch. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Akai and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202437).

         <title>Chemistry of Pentafluorosulfanyl Derivatives and Related Analogs: From Synthesis to Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 60, October 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
SF6 building blocks: This review article summarizes the recent synthetic methodology dedicated to pentafluorosulfanyl derivatives and their related analogs. The properties and up&#8208;to&#8208;date applications in materials sciences and medicinal chemistry of SF5&#8208;containing compounds are also discussed here.







Abstract
Pentafluorosulfanyl (SF5)&#8208;containing compounds and corresponding analogs are a highly valuable class of fluorine&#8208;containing building blocks owing to their unique properties. The reason for that is the set of peculiar and tremendously beneficial characteristics they can impart on molecules once introduced onto them. Despite this, their application in distinct scientific fields remains modest, given the extremely harsh reaction conditions needed to access such compounds. The recent synthetic approaches via S&#8722;F, and C&#8722;SF5 bond formation as well as the use of SF5&#8208;containing building blocks embody a &#8220;stairway&#8208;to&#8208;heaven&#8221; loophole in the synthesis of otherwise&#8208;inaccessible chemical scaffolds only a few years ago. Herein, we report and evaluate the properties of the SF5 group and analogs, by summarizing synthetic methodologies available to access them as well as following applications in material science and medicinal chemistry since 2015.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 60, October 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coordination chemistry of f&#8208;block elements in molten salts has become a resounding topic owing to fundamental interests and potential applications in molten salt reactors and pyroprocessing. This concept paper highlights the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in the coordination chemistry of f&#8208;block elements in molten salts, which may advance understanding of the nature of molten salt fuels, coolants and electrolytes.







Abstract
The coordination chemistry of f&#8208;block elements (lanthanide and actinide) in molten salts has become a resounding topic in view of its great importance to the research and development (R&amp;D) of molten salt reactors and pyroprocessing. In this Review article, a general overview of the coordination chemistry of f&#8208;block elements in molten salts is provided including past achievements and recent advances. Particular emphases are placed on the oxidation state, speciation, and solution structure of f&#8208;block metal ions in molten salts, as well as their relationships with the salt composition. Furthermore, this review briefly discusses the spectroscopic and theoretical methods that complement each other in revealing the coordination properties.

         <title>Tetra(peri&#8209;naphthylene)anthracene: A near&#8208;IR Fluorophore with Four&#8208;Stage Amphoteric Redox Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel benign synthetic strategy towards soluble tetra( peri &#8208;naphthylene)anthracene (TPNA) decorated with triisopropylsilylethynyl substituents has been established. The compound is perfectly stable under ambient conditions in air and features intense and strongly bathochromically shifted UV/vis absorption and emission bands reaching to near&#8208;IR region beyond 900&#160;nm. Cyclic voltammetry measurements revealed four facilitated reversible redox events comprising two oxidations and two reductions. These remarkable experimental findings were corroborated by theoretical studies to identify the TPNA platform a particularly useful candidate for the development of functional near&#8208;IR fluorophores upon appropriate functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrostatic CH&#8208;&#960; Interactions Can Override Fluorine Gauche Effects to Exert Conformational Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorine gauche effects are conformational properties of 2fluoroethanes often applied in modern molecular designs. However, the physical origins of fluorine gauche effects are not well understood, with the consensus favoring the established hyperconjugation theory over an emerging electrostatic model. Using a series of model systems, we show that a shift to fluorine gauche effects can be influenced by intramolecular CH&#960; aromatic interactions, a throughspace event. Modulating the &#960;&#8208;ring (forming the aromatic interaction) with substituent groups resulted in a linear Hammett relationship, indicating the CH&#960; interaction has electrostatic features. For instance, attaching a nitro group (an electron&#8208;withdrawing substituent) to the &#960;&#8208;ring weakened the CH&#960; interaction and led to a gauche preference, whereas an anti conformer is preferred with amine as substituent. The experimental results performed using proton NMR spectroscopy are corroborated by gas&#8208;phase DFT calculations and solid&#8208;state X&#8208;ray crystallography</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Polysubstituted Symmetrical BODIPYs via Fischer Carbene Complexes: Theoretical, Photophysical and Electrochemical Evaluation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyrrole polyfunctionalized core is obtained from Fischer alkynyl carbenes and oxazolones and used to obtain highly functionalized symmetric BODIPYs with modulating optoelectronic properties.







Abstract
A series of new symmetrical highly substituted BODIPYs 6&#8201;a&#8211;l was synthesized through a prefunctionalization approach in 35&#8201;%&#8211;89&#8201;% yields from the pyrrole core. This strategy allowed modulation of the substituents at the different positions based on the choice of Fischer's alkynyl carbenes, oxazolones and aldehydes used as precursors. The substituent variation at positions 2, 6, 3 and 5 had the greatest effect on the modulation of their photophysical properties such as absorption (&#955;abs) and emission (&#955;em) wavelengths, extinction coefficient (&#1013;), quantum yields (&#981;), Stokes shifts (&#916;&#957;), fluorescence decay, radiative (krad) and non&#8208;radiative (knr) constants and the CIE 1931 coordinates. Theoretical calculations allowed to corroborate the effect of the substituents of meso&#8208;position on the modification of the dihedral angles. Cyclic voltammetry studies revealed that the BODIPY series presents similar redox potential behavior, being electrochemically active even in successive cycles, which suggests that transport by diffusion is the dominant process.

         <title>Efficient Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Highly Stereoselective Synthesis of Unprotected C&#8208;Acyl Manno&#8208;, Rhamno&#8208; and Lyxopyranosides</title>

         <dc:description>
Just a pinch of copper iodide promotes the reaction of manno&#8208;type glycosyl iodides with lithiated dithianes. Herein, we report an efficient and highly &#945;&#8208;selective four&#8208;step one&#8208;pot method for the synthesis of unprotected manno&#8208;type C&#8208;acyl pyranosides. The crucial role of the catalyst was proven by mechanistic studies and DFT calculations, suggesting a copper&#8208;radical mechanism over a SN&#8208;type mechanism.







Abstract
Due to their high stability towards enzymatic hydrolysis C&#8208;acyl glycosidic compounds are useful synthetic intermediates for potential candidates in drug discovery. Syntheses for C&#8208;acyl mannosides have remained scarce and usually employ donors obtained from lengthy syntheses. Furthermore, syntheses of unprotected C&#8208;acyl mannosides have not been reported so far, due to the incapability of the C&#8208;acyl mannoside motif with deprotection conditions for protective groups commonly used in carbohydrate chemistry. Herein, we report an efficient and highly &#945;&#8208;selective four&#8208;step one&#8208;pot method for the synthesis of C&#8208;acyl &#945;&#8208;d&#8208;manno&#8208;, l&#8208;rhamno&#8208; and d&#8208;lyxopyranosides from easily accessible persilylated monosaccharides and dithianes requiring only trace amounts of a copper source as catalyst and explain the crucial role of the catalyst by mechanistic studies. Furthermore, the C&#8208;acyl &#945;&#8208;glycosides were easily isomerized to give rapid access to their &#946;&#8208;anomers.

         <title>Mitochondrial Targeting and Imaging with Small Organic Conjugated Fluorophores: A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive overview on reported small molecule fluorophores exploited as mitochondrial imaging materials is carried out, with particular focus on the synthetic approaches used for the different chemistries, the photophysical characteristics of the probes and their cell biology evaluation.







Abstract
The last decade has seen an increasingly large number of studies reporting on the development of novel small organic conjugated systems for mitochondrial imaging exploiting optical signal transduction pathways. Mitochondria are known to play a critical role in a number of key biological processes, including cellular metabolism. Importantly, irregularities on their working function are nowadays understood to be intimately linked to a range of clinical conditions, highlighting the importance of targeting mitochondria for therapeutic benefits. In this work we carry out an in&#8208;depth evaluation on the progress to date in the field to pave the way for the realization of superior alternatives to those currently existing. The manuscript is structured by commonly used chemical scaffolds and comprehensively covers key aspects factored in design strategies such as synthetic approaches as well as photophysical and biological characterization, to foster collaborative work among organic and physical chemists as well as cell biologists.

         <title>Effective Iodine Capture Behavior by a Censer&#8208;shaped Macrocycle in Vapor Phase and Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cyclotrixylohydroquinoylene (CTX) derivative, CTX[P(O)Ph], was reported as an efficient iodine adsorbent here. The CTX[P(O)Ph] powder exhibited high performance in both of iodine vapor adsorption and iodine aqueous solution adsorption. More importantly, two types of iodine loading crystal structures were obtained under different conditions to reveal the adsorption mechanism.







Abstract
Iodine capture is of great significance for disposal of the hazardous radioactive iodine. CTX[P(O)Ph], one kind of censer&#8208;shaped macrocycle cyclotrixylohydroquinoylene (CTX) derivatives, was applied as an efficient iodine adsorbent. It showed satisfactory iodine adsorption capacity in vapor phase and could be reused without obvious adsorption capacity loss. Besides, the adsorbent could also uptake iodine in water. Fortunately, two iodine loading CTX[P(O)Ph] crystal structures were obtained under different conditions to explore the mechanism of iodine adsorption. This work provides a relatively rare example of iodine adsorption by macrocycle. It is promising that the results with crystal information might be meaningful for exploring and designing new kinds of iodine adsorbents.

This work provides a relatively rare example of iodine adsorption by macrocycle. It is promising that the results with crystal information might be meaningful for exploring and designing new kinds of iodine adsorbents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Revealing Phosphorus Nitrides up to the Megabar Regime: Synthesis of &#945;&#8242;&#8208;P3N5, &#948;&#8208;P3N5 and PN2</title>

For the last 30&#8197;years, the lack of a binary phosphorus nitride containing PN6 octahedra formed a scientific chasm between carbon&#8208;group and oxygen&#8208;group nitrides, both featuring a variety of solids with XN6 units (X being a non&#8208;metal element). Now, the discovery of the &#948;&#8208;P3N5 and PN2 phosphorus nitrides&#8212;formed under high pressure and both composed of the elusive PN6 octahedron&#8212;builds a long&#8208;sought&#8208;after bridge between these two groups of nitrides. More information can be found in the Research Article by D. Laniel, F. Trybel, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201998).

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Divergent Ring&#8208;Opening Rearrangement of Cyclopropenes Enabled by Dichotomous Gold&#8722;Carbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two in One: A gold&#8208;catalyzed divergent ring&#8208;opening rearrangement of cyclopropenes has been developed for concise synthesis of structurally important polysubstituted naphthols and furans enabled by the dichotomous gold&#8722;carbenes. The use of different gold&#8208;catalysts allows for successful tuning of gold carbene reactivity or gold carbenoid reactivity in organic synthesis.







Abstract
The gold&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening rearrangement of cyclopropenes affords an efficient route to either polysubstituted naphthols or aryl&#8208;substituted furans. Owing to the unique dichotomy of gold&#8722;carbenes, this protocol provides a switchable reaction selectivity between naphthols and furans enabled by the use of TFP&#8722;Au(MeCN)SbF6 (tri(2&#8208;furyl) phosphine) or PNP(AuNTf2)2 (bis(diphenylphosphino)(isopropyl) amine) as catalysts respectively. It is proposed that the gold&#8722;carbene intermediate might be involved in the cyclopropene&#8594;naphthol rearrangement while the gold&#8208;carbocation is more likely to be involved in the cyclopropene&#8594;furan rearrangement.

         <title>Peri&#8208;Functionalized Tetraazaperylenes: Strong Emitters for Molecular Polaritonics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polaritonics with Peri Functionalized Tetraazaperylenes. Functionalization with electron donating groups leads to a class of highly fluorescent dyes, containing a tetraazaperylene core, which are excellent materials in strong light&#8208;matter coupling in resonant optical microcavities. This new class of functional dyes, whose properties can be simply tuned, showed fascinating behavior in molecular polaritonics.







Abstract
The functionalization of the peri position of the bay chlorinated tetraazaperylene was investigated by varying the donor behavior of the substituents to assess the resulting photophysical and electrochemical properties. To accomplish this, electron donating alkyl&#8208; and arylsulfido substituents, methoxy and methyl groups were selectively introduced into the peri position via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution of the perchlorinated tetraazaperylene. Both the alkylated and benzylated thioethers displayed high fluorescence quantum yields of up to 80&#8201;%. Compounds from the latter group were integrated in resonant optical microcavities to achieve strong light&#8208;matter coupling. The formation of exciton&#8208;polaritons was observed by angle&#8208;dependent reflectivity and photoluminescence that could be tuned by variation of the concentration of the fluorophores and of the thickness of the cavity.

         <title>Pushing the Limits of Nucleic Acid Function</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA and RNA molecules are capable of a wide range of functions. Here I provide an overview of how nucleic acids with interesting and useful properties can be identified and optimized using artificial evolution. I also describe motifs that push the limits of DNA and RNA function in various ways. These examples highlight the remarkable functional potential of nucleic acids.







Abstract
For many decades it was thought that information storage and information transfer were the main functions of nucleic acids. However, artificial evolution experiments have shown that the functional potential of DNA and RNA is much greater. Here I provide an overview of this technique and highlight recent advances which have increased its potency. I also describe how artificial evolution has been used to identify nucleic acids with extreme functions. These include deoxyribozymes that generate unusual products such as light, tiny motifs made up of fewer than ten nucleotides, ribozymes that catalyze complex reactions such as RNA polymerization, information&#8208;rich sequences that encode overlapping ribozymes, motifs that catalyze reactions at rates too fast to be followed by manual pipetting, and functional nucleic acids which are active in extreme conditions. Such motifs highlight the limits of our knowledge and provide clues about as of yet undiscovered functions of DNA and RNA.

         <title>Fused Bis(hemi&#8208;indigo): Broad&#8208;Range Wavelength&#8208;Independent Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis(hemi&#8208;indigo) derivatives are introduced as unique photoswitches with wavelength&#8208;independent isomeric ratios in photostationary states. The wavelength&#8208;independent photoswitching, high bistability and significant overlap between the photoswitch absorption and the solar spectrum make bis(hemi&#8208;indigo) derivatives interesting candidates for MOST applications.







Abstract
Wavelength&#8208;independent conversion of organic photoswitches in the photostationary state is a rare phenomenon that opens up a way for many practical applications. In this work, three fused bis(hemi&#8208;indigo) derivatives with different substitution patterns were synthesized and their photoswitching was investigated by optical spectroscopy, real&#8208;time NMR spectroscopy and TD&#8208;DFT calculations. We disclosed that the Z&#8208;E photoisomerization of the meta&#8208;bis(hemi&#8208;indigo) derivative was remarkably independent of the irradiation wavelength from UV up to yellow light. The wavelength&#8208;independent forward photoswitching together with the inhibited backward photoisomerization, high thermal stability of the photoinduced isomers as well as significant overlap between the photoswitch absorption and the solar spectrum allows to suggest bis(hemi&#8208;indigo) derivatives as promising candidates for molecular solar thermal energy storage (MOST) systems.

         <title>Labile Base&#8208;Stabilized Silyliumylidene Ions. Non&#8208;Metallic Species Capable of Activating Multiple Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various base&#8208;stabilized silyliumylidene ions with different ligands were synthesized. Their behaviour appeared strongly dependent on the type of ligand. Indeed, in contrast to the poorly reactive silyliumylidenes stabilized by strongly donating ligands (DMAP, NHC), the sulfide&#8208;supported one (SMe2) exhibits higher reactivity toward various small molecules. Furthermore, their capability to successively activate multiple small molecules was clearly demonstrated by processes involving successive reactions with silane/formamide, CO2 and H2. Of particular interest, the silyliumylidene&#8208;silylene complex is one of the rare species able to activate two H2 molecules.







Abstract
Several base&#8208;stabilized silyliumylidene ions (2 and 3) with different ligands were synthesized. Their behaviour appeared strongly dependent on the nature of ligand. Indeed, in contrast to the poorly reactive silyliumylidene ions 3&#8201;c,d stabilized by strongly donating ligands (DMAP, NHC), the silylene&#8208; and sulfide&#8208;supported one (2&#8208;H and 3&#8201;a) exhibits higher reactivity toward various small molecules. Furthermore, their capability to successively activate multiple small molecules was clearly demonstrated by processes involving successive reactions with silane/formamide, CO2 and H2. Moreover, HBPin adduct of 3&#8201;a (8&#8208;C) catalyzes the hydroboration of pyridine. Of particular interest, silylene&#8208;supported silyliumylidene complex 2&#8208;H is one of the rare species able to activate two H2 molecules.

         <title>A Piezo&#8208;Fenton System with Rapid Iron Cycling and Hydrogen Peroxide Self&#8208;Supply Driven by Ultrasound</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;Fe was synthesized with varied Fe amount to construct a piezo&#8208;Fenton system driven by ultrasound, achieving the coupling of piezoelectric processes and Fenton reactions without exogenous hydrogen peroxide. Electrons generated in the piezoelectric process takes part in hydrogen peroxide production and accelerate the Fe2+/Fe3+ cycle. The piezo&#8208;Fenton system exhibited excellent and stable hydroxyl radical generating capacity in pH&#8197;2&#8211;9 without iron leaking, and the hydroxyl radicals mainly contributed to the degradation of MB and the sterilization process.







Abstract
The piezo&#8208;Fenton system has attracted attention not only because it can enhance the Fenton reaction activity by mechanical energy input, but also because it is expected to realize a class of stimuli&#8208;responsive advanced oxidation systems by regulating energy input and hydrogen peroxide self&#8208;supply, thus greatly enriching the application possibilities of Fenton chemistry. In this work, a series of Fe&#8208;doped g&#8208;C3N4 (g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;Fe) as a piezo&#8208;Fenton system were synthesized where the iron stably immobilized through Fe&#8722;N interaction. The piezo&#8208;induced electrons generate on g&#8208;C3N4 matrix support the conversion of Fe(III) to Fe(II) and promote rate&#8208;limiting step of Fenton reaction. With the optimal Fe loading, g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;0.5Fe can achieve methylene blue (MB) degradation under ultrasonic treatment with first&#8208;order kinetic rate constants of 75&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;min&#8722;1. Most importantly, the g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;Fe can maintain good catalytic activity in a wide pH range (pH=2.0&#8764;9.0) and be cyclic used without iron leaching to solution (&lt;0.001&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1), overcoming the disadvantage of traditional Fe&#8208;based Fenton catalysts that can only be applied under acidic conditions and prone to secondary pollution. In addition, g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;0.5Fe also exhibits antibacterial properties of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus under ultrasound. Hydroxyl radicals mainly contribute to the degradation of MB and the sterilization process. Our work is an attempt to clarify the role of g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;Fe in the conversion of mechanical energy to ROS and provide inspirations for the piezo&#8208;Fenton system design.

         <title>Binding of Glycans to the SARS CoV&#8208;2 Spike Protein, an Open Question: NMR Data on Binding Site Localization, Affinity, and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sweet, but not so sweet. The SARS CoV&#8208;2 spike glycoprotein engages in weak interactions with sialoglycans, but binding to ABO(H) blood group antigens cannot be confirmed by STD NMR experiments. Chemical shift perturbation experiments show that none of the glycans interacts with the receptor binding domain of the spike glycoprotein.







Abstract
We have used NMR experiments to explore the binding of selected glycans and glycomimetics to the SARS CoV&#8208;2 spike glycoprotein (S&#8208;protein) and to its receptor binding domain (RBD). STD NMR experiments confirm the binding of sialoglycans to the S&#8208;protein of the prototypic Wuhan strain virus and yield dissociation constants in the millimolar range. The absence of STD effects for sialoglycans in the presence of the Omicron/BA.1 S&#8208;protein reflects a loss of binding as a result of S&#8208;protein evolution. Likewise, no STD effects are observed for the deletion mutant &#916;143&#8211;145 of the Wuhan S&#8208;protein, thus supporting localization of the binding site in the N&#8208;terminal domain (NTD). The glycomimetics Oseltamivir and Zanamivir bind weakly to the S&#8208;protein of both virus strains. Binding of blood group antigens to the Wuhan S&#8208;protein cannot be confirmed by STD NMR. Using 1H,15N TROSY HSQC&#8208;based chemical shift perturbation (CSP) experiments, we excluded binding of any of the ligands studied to the RBD of the Wuhan S&#8208;protein. Our results put reported data on glycan binding into perspective and shed new light on the potential role of glycan&#8208;binding to the S&#8208;protein.

A single pentagon defect in a single&#8208;layered graphene catalyst is emphasized next to a control structure (pentagon ring passivated by oxygen). The small molecules near the defect represent the reactant and intermediate product of the oxygen reduction reaction. Lightning around the graphene indicates how the pentagon defect was fabricated with electro&#8208;assistance and the oxygen reduction reaction was driven by electrical energy. More information on identifying the catalyst's precise active site can be found in the Research Article by F. Qiu, L. Zhang, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202700).

         <title>Preorganized Polyaromatic Soft Terdentate Hosts for the Capture of [Ln(&#946;&#8208;diketonate)3] Guests in Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The concept of preorganization is famous in coordination chemistry for having transformed flexible bidentate 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine scaffolds into rigid 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline platforms. The resulting boosted affinities for d&#8208;block cations successfully paved the way for the design of a wealth of functional complexes, devices and materials for analysis and optics. Its extension toward terdentate homologues adapted for the selective complexation of f&#8208;block cations with larger coordination numbers remains more confidential. The hereby rigidification of 2,6&#8208;bis(1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyridine ligands (  L1&#8208;L7  ) produces the highly preorganized and extended polyaromatic naphthyridines (  L8  &#8208;  L11  ) receptors, which offer some novel and rare opportunities for efficiently complexing trivalent lanthanides with polyaromatic soft terimine ligands. The crystal structures of the stable heteroleptic [  L  k  Ln(hfac)  3  ] adducts show a drastic decrease of the Ln&#8208;N bond valences upon replacement of the flexible ligand  L1  with its preorganized counterparts  L8  and  L9  . This points to an inconveniencing and limited match between the preorganized cavity and the entering [Ln(hfac)  3  ] lanthanide containers. However, thermodynamic studies conducted in dichloromethane reach the opposite conclusion with an improved affinity, by up to three orders of magnitude for catching Ln(hfac)  3  when  L1  is replaced by the preorganized  L8  &#8208;  L9  receptors. The key to the enigma lies in the removal of the energy penalty which accompanies the formation of flexible [  L1  Ln(hfac)  3  ] complexes in solution.&#160; As planned, the rigid, planar and extended  p  &#8208;conjugated system found in  L8  and  L9  shifts the ligand&#8208;centered absorption bands&#160; toward lower energies.</dc:description>

         <title>Going Viral: An Investigation into the Chameleonic Behavior or Antiviral Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability to adjust conformations in response to the polarity of the environment, i.e. molecular chameleonicity, is considered to be important for conferring both high aqueous solubility and high cell permeability to drugs in chemical space beyond Lipinski&#8217;s rule of 5. We determined the conformational ensembles populated by the antiviral drugs asunaprevir, simeprevir, atazanavir and daclatasvir in polar (DMSO&#8208;  d  6  ) and non&#8208;polar (chloroform) environments with NMR spectroscopy. Daclatasvir was fairly rigid, whereas the first three showed large flexibility in both environments, that translated into major differences in solvent accessible 3D polar surface area within each conformational ensemble. No significant differences in size and polar surface area were observed between the DMSO&#8208;  d  6  and chloroform ensembles of these three drugs. We propose that such flexible compounds are characterized as &#8220;partial molecular chameleons&#8221; and hypothesize that their ability to adopt conformations with low polar surface area contributes to their membrane permeability and oral absorption.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimization of G&#8208;Quadruplex Ligands through a SAR Study by Combining Parallel Synthesis and Screening of Cationic Bis(acylhydrazones)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s), secondary structures adopted by guanine&#8208;rich DNA and RNA sequences, are implicated in numerous biological processes and have been suggested as potential drug targets. Accordingly, there is an increasing interest in developing high&#8208;throughput methods allowing the generation of congeneric series of G4&#8208;targeting molecules (&#8220;ligands&#8221;) and investigation of their interaction with the targets. Here, we developed an operationally simple method of parallel synthesis to generate &#8220;ready&#8208;to&#8208;screen&#8221; libraries of cationic acylhydrazones, a motif that we have previously identified as a promising scaffold for potent, biologically active G4 ligands. Combined with well&#8208;established screening techniques, such as fluorescence melting, this method enables rapid synthesis and screening of combinatorial libraries of potential G4 ligands. Following this protocol, we synthesized a combinatorial library of 90 bis(acylhydrazones) and screened it against five different nucleic acid structures. This way, we were able to analyze the structure&#8211;activity relationships within this series of G4 ligands, and identified three novel promising ligands whose interaction with G4&#8208;DNA of different topologies was carefully studied by a combination of several biophysical techniques, including native mass spectrometry, and molecular modeling.</dc:description>

         <title>Specific Lipid Studies in Complex Membranes by Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Specific lipid interaction in complex membranes: Specific interactions with lipids are critical for proteins and drugs, however, direct structural measurements of interactions with lipids remain difficult, especially in membranes that mimic biological conditions. Here, a broadly applicable solid&#8208;state NMR approach is presented that enables to directly measure specific interactions with lipids such as cardiolipin in complex fluid membranes.







Abstract
Specific interactions with phospholipids are often critical for the function of proteins or drugs, but studying these interactions at high resolution remains difficult, especially in complex membranes that mimic biological conditions. In principle, molecular interactions with phospholipids could be directly probed by solid&#8208;state NMR (ssNMR). However, due to the challenge to detect specific lipids in mixed liposomes and limited spectral sensitivity, ssNMR studies of specific lipids in complex membranes are scarce. Here, by using purified biological 13C,15N&#8208;labeled phospholipids, we show that we can selectively detect traces of specific lipids in complex membranes. In combination with 1H&#8208;detected ssNMR, we show that our approach provides unprecedented high&#8208;resolution insights into the mechanisms of drugs that target specific lipids. This broadly applicable approach opens new opportunities for the molecular characterization of specific lipid interactions with proteins or drugs in complex fluid membranes.

         <dc:description>
Enabling semiconducting properties in N&#8208;acenoacenes. Reducing the steric demand of N&#8208;acenoacenes tunes the solid&#8208;state packings of N&#8208;acenoacenes in favor of &#960;&#8211;&#960;&#8208;stacking, allowing charge transfer through the crystal lattice. The first utilization of N&#8208;acenoacenes in p&#8208;type organic thin&#8208;film transistors is reported.







Abstract
Four N&#8208;acenoacenes were synthesized and analyzed for their optoelectronic properties and solid&#8208;state packings. Two of the regioisomeric acridinoacridines are TIPS&#8208;ethynylated, whereas the other pair are Boc&#8208; and triflate substituted derivatives. The two TIPS&#8208;ethynyldiazaacenoacenes were processed into organic thin&#8208;film transistors with saturation hole mobilities reaching 2.9&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;cm2(Vs)&#8722;1.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Electrochromic Behavior of Dibenzothiepin Derivatives Attached with Two Michler's Hydrol Blue Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dibenzothiepin&#8208;based redox pair and its analogues exhibit an electrochomic behavior with drastic change in the UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR absorption, thus suitable for developing new bioimaging protocols. The structural change of the central seven&#8208;membered ring was found to be the key to gain electrochemical bistability upon two&#8208;electron transfer nearly at the same potential.

10,11&#8208;Bis[bis(4&#8208;dimethylaminophenyl)methylene]dibenzo[bf]thiepin (1) and &#8208;oxepin (2) were prepared as stable yellow crystalline compounds, which are the cyclic analogues of electron&#8208;donating hexaarylbutadienes. Upon two&#8208;electron oxidation, they are reversibly transformed into the title dications (12+ and 22+) exhibiting near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorptions, which were also isolated as stable salts. These redox pairs can serve as new entries into less well&#8208;explored organic NIR&#8208;electrochromic systems, and the separation of redox peaks (electrochemical bistability) was attained for 1/12+ and 2/22+, thanks to drastic geometrical changes between neutral and dicationic states, as revealed by a series of X&#8208;ray analyses. Thiepin&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide analogue (3/32+) exhibits quite similar dynamic redox behavior due to nonaromatic nature of the dibenzothiepin and &#8208;oxepin unit in 12+ and 22+, whereas the thiepin&#8208;S&#8208;oxide derivative (4/42+) does not exhibit bistability due to the smaller change in geometry upon electron transfer, showing that a subtle change of a bridging atom in the central seven&#8208;membered ring can modify the redox properties.

         <title>Phomoxanthone A Targets ATP Synthase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new inhibitor of ATP synthase: Through photoaffinity labelling and chemoproteomics analysis it was discovered, and subsequently validated, that phomoxanthone A is an inhibitor of ATP synthase. This discovery may inspire the design of new inhibitors targeting the beta subunit of ATP synthase.







Abstract
Phomoxanthone A is a naturally occurring molecule and a powerful anti&#8208;cancer agent, although its mechanism of action is unknown. To facilitate the determination of its biological target(s), we used affinity&#8208;based labelling using a phomoxanthone A probe. Labelled proteins were pulled down, subjected to chemoproteomics analysis using LC&#8208;MS/MS and ATP synthase was identified as a likely target. Mitochondrial ATP synthase was validated in cultured cells lysates and in live intact cells. Our studies show sixty percent inhibition of ATP synthase by 260&#8197;&#956;M phomoxanthone&#8197;A.

         <title>Synthetic Studies towards the Calcium&#8208;Dependent Lipopeptide Antibiotic Cadaside B</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cadaside B is a novel calcium&#8208;dependent lipopeptide antibiotic, bearing multiple rare non&#8208;canonical amino acids and exhibiting potent antimicrobial activity towards multi&#8208;drug resistant Gram&#8208;positive pathogens. Synthetic studies towards cadaside B yielded a compound possessing the desired connectivity of macrocyclic scaffold, but poorly matching 1H NMR spectra and lack of bioactivity. Insights and challenges towards the total synthesis are presented.







Abstract
In the current global crisis of antimicrobial resistance, antimicrobial peptides represent a promising source of alternative antibiotics. Recently discovered cadaside B, a novel calcium&#8208;dependent antibiotic, exhibits potent antimicrobial activity towards Gram&#8208;positive pathogens including multi&#8208;drug resistant strains. These properties, coupled with a novel structure, non&#8208;cytotoxicity, and low likelihood of developing resistance render cadaside B an important synthetic target. Herein, a synthetic strategy towards cadaside B is reported with the key steps involving on&#8208;resin depsipeptide bond formation and solution&#8208;phase macrolactamization. Good agreement of the synthetic cadaside B MS/MS fragmentation pattern was observed with the natural product, but a different 1H NMR spectrum and absence of antimicrobial activity suggest an undetected epimerization event took place during the synthesis. Herein the findings of our synthetic journey and suggestions for future directions are presented.

         <title>Unveiling the Potential of Innovative Gold(I) and Silver(I) Selenourea Complexes as Anticancer Agents Targeting TrxR and Cellular Redox Homeostasis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Innovative Au(I) and Ag(I) NHC&#8208;based selenourea complexes exhibit a prominent anticancer effect by selectively targeting TrxR in human cancer cells, thus hampering cancer cell redox machinery and inducing apoptotic cell death.







Abstract
A series of NHC&#8208;based selenourea Ag(I) and Au(I) complexes were evaluated for their anticancer potential in&#8197;vitro, on 2D and 3D human cancer cell systems. All NHC&#8208;based selenourea complexes possess an outstanding cytotoxic potency, which was comparable or even better than that of the reference metallodrug auranofin, and were also able to overcome both platinum&#8208;based and multi&#8208;drug resistances. Intriguingly, their cytotoxic potency did not correlate with solution stability, partition coefficient or cellular uptake. On the other hand, mechanistic studies in cancer cells revealed their ability to strongly and selectively inhibit the redox&#8208;regulating enzyme Thioredoxin Reductase (TrxR), being even more effective than auranofin, a well&#8208;known TrxR inhibitor, without affecting other redox enzymes such as Glutathione Reductase (GR). The inhibition of TrxR in H157 human cancer cells caused, in turn, the disruption of cellular thiol&#8208;redox homeostasis and of mitochondria pathophysiology, ultimately leading to cancer cell death through apoptosis.

         <title>An Optimized Ni&#8208;catalyzed Chan&#8208;Lam Type Coupling: Enantioretentive Access to Chiral N&#8208;Aryl Sulfinamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An optimized Ni&#8208;catalyzed Chan&#8208;Lam type coupling reaction was optimized. A series of chiral N&#8208;aryl sulfinamides was prepared with high chemical yield without any racemization. A plausible and novel mechanism was proposed and this method is useful for preparing various C&#8722;X bonds efficiently.







Abstract
C&#8722;N bond formation takes on a critical significance in reactions of organic synthesis, material production and pharmaceutical manufactory. Chan&#8208;Lam has proposed a useful methodology to furnish secondary arylamides under mild conditions. However, when chiral sulfinamides serve as the coupling precursors, the Cu&#8208;catalyzed coupling reaction is found with low efficacy. Complex side&#8208;products are generated under classic conditions. Moreover, it led to the racemization of the coupling product. In this study, an optimized Ni&#8208;catalyzed Chan&#8208;Lam type coupling conditions were proposed, which resulted in clean conversion from chiral sulfinamides and arylboronic acids to offer N&#8208;aryl sulfinamides efficiently and enantioretentively. The trans&#8208;N1,N2&#8208;dimethylcyclohexane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine was proven as the most efficient ligand. Under the optimized conditions, a series of chiral N&#8208;aryl sulfinamides was prepared with high chemical yield without racemization. Furthermore, a plausible and novel mechanism was proposed. Interestingly, the method could efficiently furnish a wide variety of C&#8722;X bonds by coupling arylboronic acids with different nucleophiles.

         <dc:description>
Convergent paired metal electrocatalysis enables the direct use of simple primary and secondary aliphatic acids as coupling partners for C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formation by radical decarboxylation. This new electrophotocatalytic method features a broad substrate scope, wide functional&#8208;group tolerance, and could be used for late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules.







Abstract
An electrophotochemical dual metal&#8208;catalyzed protocol for decarboxylative arylation of simple aliphatic carboxylic acids with aryl halides is reported. The relative stabilities of catalytically active metal complexes simultaneously generated at anode and cathode are the key design elements for the success of this convergent paired electrolysis. This new electrophotocatalytic method is mild, robust, and most importantly, capable of accommodating simple primary aliphatic acids including acetic acid &#8211; ubiquitous and variegated structural motifs yet remain oddly challenging substrates &#8211; directly as native functional groups for decarboxylative C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formation.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pillararene&#8208;based supramolecular vesicles are self&#8208;assembled from the supra&#8208;amphiphiles, consisting of macrocyclic hosts pillararenes and amphiphilic guests linked together through noncovalent interactions, and are endowed with the stimuli&#8208;responsive controlled release performances for use in smart drug delivery. The background of the graphic matches the120th anniversary of Nanjing University (NJU).







Abstract
Supramolecular vesicles (SMVs) self&#8208;assembled from the supra&#8208;amphiphiles, consisting of two scaffolds linked together through noncovalent interactions, can realize stimuli&#8208;responsive controlled release of encapsulated drugs for enhanced therapeutic efficacy and minimized side effect of drugs. Pillararenes (PAs), an emerging kind of macrocyclic hosts in 2008, are easy to modify with a variety of functionalities. SMVs from PAs and specific guests mainly based on the host&#8211;guest interactions have attracted increasing attention because of their drug delivery and controlled drug release. A great progress in the construction and stimuli&#8208;responsive drug delivery of the PA&#8208;based SMVs has been made since the first work was reported in 2012. This review summarizes the major achievements of the PA&#8208;based SMVs for stimuli&#8208;responsive drug delivery over the past 5&#8197;years, including the microstructures of SMVs, multiple stimuli&#8208;responsive SMVs, prodrug SMVs from prodrug PAs and guests, bola&#8208;type SMVs, multifunctional SMVs, glucose&#8208;responsive SMVs for insulin delivery, novel SMVs from responsive PAs, thermo&#8208;responsive SMVs, and ternary SMVs, for chemotherapy, photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, and other biological applications. The future challenges and research directions of PA&#8208;based SMVs are also outlined from the points of views of the fundamental research, biological applications, and clinical applications of PA&#8208;based SMVs.

A facile and environmentally friendly electrochemical protocol is herein reported for the C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) cross dehydrogenative coupling between imidazopyridines and N,N&#8208;dimethylanilines.







Abstract
A facile and environmentally friendly electrochemical protocol is herein reported for the C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) cross dehydrogenative coupling between imidazopyridines and N,N&#8208;dimethylanilines. The broad functional group compatibility includes halogens, ester, alcohol, sulfone as well as thiophene. This methodology is also suitable for benzo[d]imidazo[2,1&#8208;b]thiazole, thiazoimidazole and tetrahydroisoquinoline, and can be scaled up to 5&#8197;mmol. Mechanistic insights are discussed.

         <title>The Radical Anion, Dianion and Electron Transport Properties of Tetraiodotetraazapentacene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Filling the gap in the series of halogenated azaacenes. Tetraiodotetraazapentacene I4TAP is prepared and characterized. Its stable radical anion and high mobilities in organic field&#8208;effect transistors make I4TAP a formidable n&#8208;type semiconductor.







Abstract
Tetraiodotetraazapentacene I4TAP, the last missing derivative in the series of halogenated silylated tetraazapentacenes, was synthesized via condensation chemistry from a TIPS&#8208;ethynylated diaminobenzothiadiazol in three steps. Single and double reduction furnished its air&#8208;stable monoanion and relatively air&#8208;stable dianion, both of which were characterized by crystallography. All three species are structurally and spectroscopically compared to non&#8208;halogenated TAP and Br4TAP. I4TAP is an n&#8208;channel material in thin&#8208;film transistors with average electron mobilities exceeding 1&#8197;cm2 (Vs)&#8722;1.

         <title>Computational Insights into the Catalytic Mechanism of Is&#8208;PETase: An Enzyme Capable of Degrading Poly(ethylene) Terephthalate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enzyme is&#8208;PETase degrades poly(ethylene) terephthalate (PET) at mesophilic temperatures. This makes is&#8208;PETase a promising candidate for the biodegradation of this common pollutant. The energy profile for the degradation of a PET substrate mimic by is&#8208;PETase was calculated by using computational quantum&#8208;mechanical/molecular mechanical methods, and the activation energy for this reaction was calculated to be 34.1&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1.







Abstract
Is&#8208;PETase has become an enzyme of significant interest due to its ability to catalyse the degradation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) at mesophilic temperatures. We performed hybrid quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) at the DSD&#8208;PBEP86&#8208;D3/ma&#8208;def2&#8208;TZVP/CHARMM27//rev&#8208;PBE&#8208;D3/dev2&#8208;SVP/CHARMM level to calculate the energy profile for the degradation of a suitable PET model by this enzyme. Very low overall barriers are computed for serine protease&#8208;type hydrolysis steps (as low as 34.1&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Spontaneous deprotonation of the final product, terephthalic acid, with a high computed driving force indicates that product release could be rate limiting.

         <title>Single&#8208;Metal&#8208;Encapsulated Double&#8208;Cage [Pt@Sn17]4&#8722;: An Exception from Group 14 Endohedral Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetrical fusion of two inhomogeneous building units [Pt@Sn9] and [Sn9] leads to the largest group&#8197;14 intermetalloid cluster [Pt@Sn17]4&#8722; encapsulating a single transition metal atom. The unusual double&#8208;cage structure could be seen as a result of the collapse of the capsule&#8208;like Sn17 framework when filled with only one Pt atom.







Abstract
Group&#8197;14 endohedral clusters containing a metal center inside usually possess a single cage topological structure, but here an unexpected single&#8208;metal&#8208;filled double&#8208;cage cluster, [Pt@Sn17]4&#8722; (1&#8201;a) is reported. It can be seen as a combination of the more extended Pt&#8208;filled [Pt@Sn9] cage and hollow [Sn9] cage sharing a central Sn atom, which is offset from the central position. This double&#8208;cage species represents the largest group&#8197;14 intermetalloid cluster encapsulating a single transition metal atom. DFT calculations show that the capsule&#8208;like architecture of [Sn17]4&#8722;, similar to that found in [Pt2@Sn17]4&#8722;, is unstable if filled with a single Pt atom and collapses to the title cluster 1&#8201;a upon geometry optimization. Deviation of the central Sn atom occurs due to the vibronic coupling as a consequence of pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion leading to the bent Cs&#8208;symmetrical structure, in contrast to the more symmetrical D2d cage previously reported in [Ni2@Sn17]4&#8722;.

         <title>Phosphorescent Bimetallic C^C* Platinum(ii) Complexes with Bridging Substituted Diphenylformamidinates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and characterization of bimetallic C^C* platinum(II) complexes with bridging diphenylformamidinates is presented alongside with two solid&#8208;state structures. The phosphorescent compounds show excellent emissive behavior with quantum yields of up to 90&#8201;% and lifetimes around 2&#8197;&#956;s. The substitution pattern in the bridging ligands influences next to the structural properties (intermetallic distance) also the photophysical characteristics. The observed effects are explained and supported by density functional theory calculations.







Abstract
A series of phosphorescent bimetallic platinum(II) complexes is presented, which were synthesized by the combination of bidentate cyclometalated N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands and different bridging diphenylformamidinates. The complexes were characterized by standard techniques and additionally two solid&#8208;state structures could be obtained. Photoluminescence measurements revealed the strong emissive behavior of the compounds with quantum yields of up to 90&#8201;% and emission lifetimes of approx. 2&#8197;&#956;s. The effect of the substitution pattern in the bridging ligands on the structural and photophysical properties of the complexes was examined in detail and rationalized by density functional theory calculations (PBE0/6&#8208;311G*).

What can you give? Reactivity studies of the L(Cl)Ge&#8901;BH3 complex were performed to determine the effect of GeII&#8594;B donation. An unprecedented GeII&#8594;Ga complex L(Cl)Ge&#8901;GaCl3 was isolated. The different strength of the GeII&#8594;E (E=B, Ga) donation was evaluated by using energy decomposition analysis (EDA) and proton affinity.







Abstract
Reactivity studies of the GeII&#8594;B complex L(Cl)Ge&#8901;BH3 (1; L=2&#8208;Et2NCH2&#8208;4,6&#8208;tBu2&#8208;C6H2) were performed to determine the effect on the GeII&#8594;B donation. N&#8208;coordinated compounds L(OtBu)Ge&#8901;BH3 (2) and [LGe&#8901;BH3]2 (3) were prepared. The possible tuning of the GeII&#8594;B interaction was proved experimentally, yielding compounds 1&#8208;PPh2&#8208;8&#8208;(LGe)&#8208;C10H6 (4) and L(Cl)Ge&#8901;GaCl3 (5) without a GeII&#8594;B interaction. In 5, an unprecedented GeII&#8594;Ga coordination was revealed. The experimental results were complemented by a theoretical study focusing on the bonding in 1&#8722;5. The different strength of the GeII&#8594;E (E=B, Ga) donation was evaluated by using energy decomposition analysis. The basicity of different L(X)Ge groups through proton affinity is also assessed.

         <title>Inducing Propeller Chirality in Triaryl Boranes with Chiral Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;point interaction between a chiral amine and a triarylborane is shown to suffice to induce a preferential propeller handedness to the borane. Rotation of aryl blades can be avoided by incorporation of naphthyl instead of phenyl and a bulky amine component.







Abstract
Stabilization of chiral propeller conformations in triaryl compounds is challenging due to generally low racemization barriers. Nonetheless, it was recently found that chiral conformational preferences can be induced to triaryl boranes by incorporating point&#8208;chiral alkylether chains to the aryl blades and subsequently locking the structure with ammonia. A four&#8208;point interaction, meaning that the cooperative effects of Lewis&#8208;adduct formation and three hydrogen bonds, was proposed as stabilizing mechanism. Herein, it was shown that three such strong interactions suffice to introduce a preferential propeller handedness. Although DFT calculations predict no noteworthy preferences for either P&#8208; or M&#8208;chiral propellers for some of the investigated triarylborane&#8211;amine adducts that were prepared with chiral primary amines, vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectroscopic characterizations revealed that there is indeed a measurable excess of one propeller handedness. Furthermore, the steric demand of the amine was found to play a key role in the induction process and especially in preventing blade rotations.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A visible light organophotocatalytic [2+2] cycloaddition of electron&#8208;deficient styrenes is described. Photocatalytic [2+2] cycloadditions are typically performed with electron&#8208;rich styrene derivatives or &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated alkenes, and with transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts. We have discovered that an organic cyanoarene photocatalyst is able to deliver high&#8208;value cyclobutane products bearing electron&#8208;deficient aryl substituents in good yields. A range of electron&#8208;deficient substituents are tolerated and both homodimerizations and intramolecular [2+2] cycloadditions to fused bicyclic systems are available using this methodology.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A significant barrier inhibiting multiplexed imaging in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) is the extensive trial and error associated with fine&#8208;tuning NIR dyes. In particular, the need to synthesize and experimentally evaluate dye derivatives in order to empirically identify those that can be used in multiplexing applications, requires a large investment of time. While coarse&#8208;tuning efforts benefit from computational prediction that can be used to identify target dye structures for synthetic campaigns, errors in computational prediction remain too large to accurately parse modifications aimed at fine&#8208;tuning changes in dye absorbance and emission. To address this issue, we screened different levels of theory and identified a time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT) approach that can rapidly, as opposed to synthesis and experimental evaluation, estimate absorbance and emission. By calibrating these computational estimations of absorbance and emission to experimentally determined parameters for a panel of existing NIR dyes, we obtain calibration curves that can be used to accurately predict the effect of fine&#8208;tuning modifications in new dyes. We demonstrate the predictive power of this calibrated dataset using seven previously unreported dyes, obtaining mean percent errors in absorbance and emission of 2.2 and 2.8%, respectively. This approach provides a significant timesavings, relative to synthesis and evaluation of dye derivatives, and can be used to focus synthetic campaigns on the most promising dye structures. The new dyes described herein can be utilized for multiplexed imaging, and the experimentally calibrated dataset will provide the dye chemistry community with a means to rapidly identify fine&#8208;tuned NIR dyes in silico to guide subsequent synthetic campaigns.</dc:description>

         <title>Finding a Deep&#8208;UV Borate BaZnB4O8 with Edge&#8208;sharing [BO4] Tetrahedra and Strong Optical Anisotropy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The polarization modulation of deep&#8208;UV light is an important process that incorporates functionality to selectively respond to light&#8208;mater interaction. Typically, optical anisotropy is foremost to the use efficiency of deep&#8208;UV birefringent crystals. Herein, a new congruently melting polyborate with extremely large birefringence (&#916;  n  (001)  = 0.14@589.3 nm) and band gap (6.89 eV) is discovered as a high performance birefringent crystal, which breaks the current deadlock of deep&#8208;UV polyborates that usually show small birefringence. The rigid tetrahedra, including [ZnO  4  ] and edge&#8208;sharing [BO  4  ] tetrahedra, make all the planar [BO  3  ] triangles in the lattice adopt preferential arrangement and thereby lead to an extraordinary large birefringence that is larger than all the deep&#8208;UV borates with experimentally measured values. Structural analyses with the additional theoretical calculations were used to study the origin of strong optical anisotropy in BaZnB  4  O  8  .</dc:description>

         <title>Dioxygen Splitting by a Tantalum(V) Complex Ligated by a Rigid, Redox Non&#8208;innocent Pincer Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reaction of TaMe3Cl2 with a rigid acridane&#8208;derived trisamine H3NNN yields the tantalum(V) complex [TaCl2(NNNcat)]. Subsequent reaction with dioxygen results in the full four&#8208;electron reduction of O2 yielding the oxo&#8208;bridged bimetallic complex [{TaCl2(NNNsq)}2O]. This dinuclear complex exhibits an open&#8208;shell ground state due to partial ligand oxidation and was comprehensively characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, LIFDI mass spectrometry, NMR, EPR, IR and UV/VIS/NIR spectroscopy. The mechanism of O2 activation was investigated by DFT calculations revealing initial binding of O2 to the tantalum(V) center followed by complete O2 scission to produce a terminal oxo&#8208;complex.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Bonded Foldamers with Axial Chirality: Chiroptical Properties and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Folding phenomenon refers to the formation of specific conformation widely featured by the intramolecular interactions, which widely exists in biomacromolecules, and are closely related to their structures and functions. A variety of oligomeric folded molecules have been designed and synthesized, namely "foldamer", exhibiting potentials in the pharmaceutical and catalysis. Molecular folding is a promising strategy to transfer chirality from substituents to the whole skeleton, when the chirality transfer, amplification, evolution and other behaviors could be achieved. Investigating chirality using foldamer model deepens the understanding of structure&#8208;function correlation in biomacromolecules, and expands the molecular toolbox towards chiroptical and asymmetrical chemistry. Substitutes with abundant hydrogen bonding sites conjugated to a rotatable aryl group afford parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;like conformation, which enables the emergence and manipulation of axial chirality. In this concept, we aim to give a brief introduction and summary of the hydrogen bonded foldamers with anchored axial chirality, by taking some recent cases as examples. The design principles, control over axial chirality and applications are also reviewed.</dc:description>

         <title>Optical Manipulation of Gb3 Enriched Lipid Domains: Impact of Isomerization on Gb3&#8208;Shiga Toxin B Interaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The plasma membrane is a complex assembly of proteins and lipids that can self&#8208;assemble in submicroscopic domains commonly termed &#8220;lipid rafts&#8221;, which are implicated in membrane signaling and trafficking. Recently, photo&#8208;sensitive lipids were introduced to study membrane domain organization, and photo&#8208;isomerization was shown to trigger the mixing and de&#8208;mixing of liquid&#8208;ordered (lo) domains in artificial phase&#8208;separated membranes.
Here, we synthesized globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) glycosphingolipids that harbor an azobenzene moiety at different positions of the fatty acid to investigate light&#8208;induced membrane domain reorganization, and that serve as specific receptors for the protein Shiga toxin (STx). Using phase&#8208;separated supported lipid bilayers on mica surfaces doped with four different photo&#8208;Gb3 molecules, we found by fluorescence microscopy and atomic force microscopy that liquid disordered (ld) domains were formed within lo domains upon trans&#8208;cis photo&#8208;isomerization. The fraction and size of these ld domains were largest for Gb3 molecules with the azobenzene group at the end of the fatty acid. We further investigated the impact of domain reorganization on the interaction of the B&#8208;subunits of STx with the photo&#8208;Gb3. Fluorescence and atomic force micrographs clearly demonstrated that STxB binds to the lo phase if Gb3 is in the trans&#8208;configuration, whereas two STxB populations are formed if the photo&#8208;Gb3 is switched to the cis&#8208;configuration highlighting the idea of manipulating lipid&#8208;protein interactions with a light stimulus.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Sterically Encumbered Thiourea S&#8208;Oxides through Direct Thiourea Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thiourea  S  &#8208;oxides can be viewed as formal analogs of the currently unknown diamino&#8208;substituted Criegee intermediates (urea  O  &#8208;oxides). However, the preparation of such  S  &#8208;oxides is rather challenging and the direct oxidation of thioureas typically only leads to formation of desulfurized products. Employing the accurate revDSD&#8208;PBEP86&#8208;D4 double hybrid density functional, we find that the peracid mediated oxidation of thiourea  S  &#8208;oxides exhibits a lower reaction barrier than the oxidation of the corresponding thiourea itself in contrast to most other ordinary thioketones. The undesired overoxidation reactivity, which is associated with strong &#960;&#8208;donation from the thiourea&#8217;s nitrogen atoms, can be partially suppressed by introduction of bulky substituents and the utilization of protic solvents. In this regard, we managed to prepare two sterically encumbered thiourea  S  &#8208;oxides in isolated yields of 35&#8722;40%. The  S  &#8208;oxides are stable in the solid state and in alcoholic solutions at room temperature for extended periods of time, but swiftly decompose in aprotic solvents by disproportionation. A dimesityl&#8208;substituted thiourea  S  &#8208;oxide complexed with residual  m  CBA could be characterized by means of X&#8208;ray crystallography, confirming the importance of hydrogen bonding in the stabilization of the amino&#8208;substituted C=S  +  &#8722;O  &#8722;  moiety.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Ring Strain and Lewis Acidity of Borirane: Synthesis, Reactivity and Density Functional Theory Studies of an Uncoordinated Arylborirane Fused to o&#8208;Carborane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Among the parent borirane, benzoborirene and orthodicarbadodecaborane&#8208;fused borirane, the latter possesses the highest ring strain and the highest Lewis acidity according to our density functional theory (DFT) studies.

         <dc:description>Cation&#8208;tuning engineering has become a new frontier in altering the electronic structure of electrocatalysts, which has been employed to enhance their electrochemical performance. Significant efforts have been made to promote the electrochemical performance of transition metal&#8208;based materials during oxygen electrocatalysis and related energy devices such as Zn&#8208;air batteries. Herein, the advantages of cation&#8208;tuning engineering, including cation vacancies/defects and cation doping, in the modification of the electronic structure of transition metal oxide catalysts are discussed. Additionally, practical applications of the cation&#8208;tuning engineering strategy are reviewed in detail with a special emphasis on oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. Lastly, challenges and future opportunities in this field are proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>The HD reaction of nitrogenase: a detailed mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogenase is the enzyme that converts N2&#160;to NH3&#160;under ambient conditions.&#160;&#160;The chemical mechanism of this catalysis at the active site FeMo&#8208;co [Fe7S9CMo(homocitrate)] is unknown.&#160;&#160;An obligatory co&#8208;product is H2, while exogenous H2&#160;is a competitive inhibitor.&#160;&#160;Isotopic substitution using exogenous D2&#160;revealed the N2&#8208;dependent reaction D2&#160;+ 2H+&#160;+ 2e&#8208;&#160; [[EQUATION]] 2HD (the &#8216;HD reaction&#8217;), together with a collection of additional experimental characteristics and requirements.&#160;&#160;In this paper I describe a detailed mechanism for the HD reaction, developed and elaborated using density functional simulations with a 486 atom model of the active site and surrounding protein.&#160;&#160;First D2&#160;binds at one Fe atom (endo&#8208;Fe6 coordination position), where it is flanked by H&#8208;Fe6 (exo&#160;position) and H&#8208;Fe2 (endo&#160;position).&#160;&#160;Then there is synchronous transfer of these two H atoms to bound D2, forming one HD bound to Fe2 and a second HD bound to Fe6.&#160;&#160;These two HD dissociate sequentially.&#160;&#160;The final phase is recovery of the two flanking H atoms.&#160;&#160;The first H atom migrates from S3B to&#160;exo&#8208;Fe6 and the second from S3B to&#160;endo&#8208;Fe2.&#160;&#160;Reaction energies and kinetic barriers are reported for all steps.&#160;&#160;This mechanism accounts for the experimental data: (a) stoichiometry; (b) the N2&#8208;dependence results from promotional N2&#160;bound at&#160;exo&#8208;Fe2; (c) different N2&#160;binding Km&#160;for the HD reaction and the NH3&#160;formation reaction results from involvement of two different sites; (d) inhibition by CO; (e) the non&#8208;occurrence of 2HD&#160; [[EQUATION]] &#160;H2&#160;+ D2&#160;results from the synchronicity of the two transfers of H to D2; (f) inhibition of HD production at high pN2&#160;is by competitive binding of N2&#160;at&#160;endo&#8208;Fe6; (g) the non&#8208;leakage of D to solvent follows from the hydrophobic environment and irreversibility of proton introduction.</dc:description>

         <title>The Insertion of E(II) and E(IV) Chlorides (E = Si, Ge) into the Si&#8211;Si Bond of Disilylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactions of silicon and germanium dichlorides L&#183;ECl2 (E = Si, L = IPr; E = Ge, L = dioxane) with the phosphino&#173;amidinato&#8208;supported disilylene ({&#954;2(N,P)&#8208;NNP}Si)2 resulted in formal tetrylene insertions into the Si&#8211;Si bond. In the case of the reaction with silylene, two products were isolated. The first, kinetic product ({&#954;2(N,P)&#8208;NNP}Si)2SiCl2, is the formal product of direct SiCl2 insertion into the Si&#8211;Si bond of ({&#954;2(N,P)&#8208;NNP}Si)2 and thus features two separated silylamido silylene centers. Over time, migration of the SiCl2 group to a lateral position afforded the second, thermodynamic product, the disilylene {&#954;2(Si,P)&#8208;SiCl2NNP}Si&#8211;Si{&#954;2(N,P)&#8208;NNP}. In contrast, insertion of GeCl2 resulted only in the isolation of the germanium analogue of {&#954;2(Si,P)&#8208;SiCl2NNP}Si&#8211;Si{&#954;2(N,P)&#8208;NNP}, containing a Ge atom in the central position namely, compound {&#954;2(Si,P)&#8208;SiCl2NNP}Ge&#8211;Si{&#954;2(N,P)&#8208;NNP}, which is a rare example of a silylene&#8208;germylene. Finally, reaction of disilylene ({&#954;2(N,P)&#8208;NNP}Si)2 with SiCl4 and SiHCl3 led to the formation of the new bis(silyl)silylene, ({NNP}SiCl2)2Si:. All four new products from these insertion reactions have been characterized by multinuclear NMR and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Directed Atroposelective C&#8211;H Iodination to Synthesize Axial Chiral Biaryl N&#8208;oxides via Enantioselective&#160;Desymmetrization Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The discovery of&#160;enantioselective desymmetrization reactions to provide practical synthesis of enantioenriched atropisomeric biaryls is a challenging topic in the field of asymmetric catalysis. Herein, we reported a highly enantioselective desymmetrization reaction for the synthesis of axially chiral biaryl N&#8208;oxides by atroposelective C&#8208;H iodination using Pd (II) coordinated by N&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine as a chiral catalyst at room temperature. A broad range of products were obtained in high yields (up to 99%) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98% ee). The products could be synthesized in gram scale, one of which was proved to be a powerful organocatalyst in asymmetric allylation reaction. Mechanistic evidence as well as DFT calculations point towards the factors that lead to high reactivity and excellent enantiocontrol in this reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Assembly of Rolling Circle Amplification&#8208;Produced Ultralong Single&#8208;Stranded DNA to Construct Biofunctional DNA Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Research advance in biomedical applications is inseparable from the development of biofunctional materials. Due to unique sequence programmability and various biological activities, DNA is a promising biological macromolecule for the precise construction of biofunctional materials. This review aims to provide an overview of the assembly of ultralong single&#8208;stranded DNA that is produced by rolling circle amplification into biofunctional materials in recent years. The first part illustrates how to construct cross&#8208;linked DNA hydrogel, during which the key point lays on overcoming electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance between ultralong DNA through improving assembly force and increasing assembly sites. The second part focuses on how to construct DNA nanocomplex, during which the key point is achieving the structure stability and function integration between different components through rationally designed DNA sequences.</dc:description>

         <title>Terminal Au&#8211;N and Au&#8211;O Units in Organometallic Frames</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since gold is located well beyond the oxo wall, chemical species with terminal Au&#8211;N and Au&#8211;O units are extremely rare and limited to low coordination numbers. We report here that these unusual units can be trapped within a suitable organometallic frame. Thus, the terminal auronitrene and auroxyl derivatives, [(CF&#8323;)&#8323;AuN]&#8315; and [(CF&#8323;)&#8323;AuO]&#8315; were identified as local minima by calculation. These open&#8208;shell, high&#8208;energy ions were experimentally detected by tandem mass spectrometry (MS&#178;): They respectively arise by N&#8322; or NO&#8322; dissociation from the corresponding precursor species [(CF&#8323;)&#8323;Au(N&#8323;)]&#8315; and [(CF&#8323;)&#8323;Au(ONO&#8322;)]&#8315; in the gas phase. Together with the known fluoride derivative [(CF&#8323;)&#8323;AuF]&#8315; , they form an interesting series of isoleptic and alloelectronic complexes of the highly acidic organogold(III) moiety (CF&#8323;)&#8323;Au with singly charged anions X&#8315; of the most electronegative elements (X = F, O, N). Ligand&#8208;field inversion in all these [(CF&#8323;)&#8323;AuX]&#8315; species results in the localization of unpaired electrons at the N and O atoms.</dc:description>

         <title>Lysosomal Targeting of &#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD) and derivatives are approved therapeutics in &gt;30 clinical settings. &#946;&#8208;CDs have also shown promise as therapeutics for treatment of some lysosomal storage disorders, such as Niemann&#8208;Pick disease type C, and other disease states which involve metabolite accumulation in the lysosome. In these cases, &#946;&#8208;CD activity relies on transport to the lysosome, wherein it can bind hydrophobic substrate and effect extraction. The post&#8208;translational attachment of N&#8208;glycans terminated in mannose&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate (M6P) residues is the predominant method by which lysosomal enzymes are targeted to the lysosome. In this work we covalently attach a synthetic biantennary bis&#8208;M6P&#8208;terminated N&#8208;glycan to &#946;&#8208;CD and study the effect of the added glycans in a mammalian cell line. The formation of a host guest complex with a Cy5 fluorophore allows study of both cellular internalisation and transport to the lysosome by fluorescence microscopy. Results indicate that the rates of both internalisation and lysosomal transport are increased by the attachment of M6P&#8208;glycans to &#946;&#8208;CD, indicating that M6P&#8208;glycan conjugation may improve the therapeutic effectiveness of &#946;&#8208;CD for the treatment of disorders involving hydrophobic metabolite accumulation in the lysosome.</dc:description>

         <title>A Plausible Prebiotic Path to Nucleosides: Ribosides and Related Aldosides are Generated from Ribulose, Fructose, and Similar Abiotic Precursors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The prebiotic origins of ribose, nucleosides, and eventually RNA are enduring questions whose answers are central to the RNA World hypothesis. The abiotic synthesis of sugars was first demonstrated over a century ago, but no known prebiotic reaction produces ribose (an aldose sugar) selectively and in good yield. In contrast, ribulose and fructose (ketose sugars) and other monosaccharides are formed in high yield by several robust abiotic reactions. We report here that ketose sugars&#8212;both ketopentoses and ketohexoes&#8212;serve as precursors for the formation of ribosides and other aldosides, as demonstrated by glycoside&#8208;forming reactions involving barbituric acid, a plausibly prebiotic nucleobase. Moreover, we discovered a one&#8208;pot reaction of glyceraldehyde and barbituric acid that under mild conditions, and without special minerals or other catalysts, results in the formation of glycosides. These results reveal that an exclusive or high&#8208;yielding generation of free ribose was not required for its incorporation into processes that provided the foundations for life.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Late&#8208;Stage Diversification of BN&#8208;Embedded Dibenzocorannulenes as Efficient Fluorescence Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diode Emitters.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis and late&#8208;stage diversification of a new class of hetero&#8208;buckybowl, BN&#8208;embedded dibenzocorannulenes (  B  2  N  2  &#8208;DBC  s).

         <title>Water Triggered Chemical Transformation of Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently emerged lead&#8208;halide perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) are promising optoelectronic material due to their easy solution processability, wide range of color tunability as well as very high photoluminescence quantum yield. Despite their significant success in lab&#8208;scale optoelectronic applications, the long&#8208;term stability becomes the main issue, hindering them towards commercialization. The highly ionic nature of such lead&#8208;halide structure makes them extremely unstable in water and air. However, recently a very few groups have taken the advantage of such nature of the crystal structure for water&#8208;triggered chemical transformation towards shape, composition and morphology controlled stable and bright PNCs which are otherwise difficult to obtain via typical direct approach. Furthermore, using polymer as an encapsulating layer for the PNCs, water soluble stable PNCs have been prepared. In this review, we summarize the recent progress on the water&#8208;hexane interface chemistry towards chemical transformation to produce several PNCs. Such method not only ensure to yield several shape controlled perovskites nanocrystals, but also formation of perovskites in aqueous phase that shows promising application towards bio&#8208;imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Stimulus Response Lanthanide MOF Materials Encapsulated with Viologen Derivatives: Characterization, Photophysical Properties and Sensing on Nitrophenols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Viologens (1,1&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyridyl) possessing electron&#8208;deficient property and redox activity, are a class of suitable chromophores to assemble metal&#8208;organic hybrid photochromic materials. &#160;Viologen&#8208;functionalized metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted much attention for their photochromic properties. &#160;However, the syntheses of lanthanide&#8208;viologen hybrid crystalline photochromic materials remain facing with many challenges, for example, the structures and properties of final products are difficult to predict and are limited by molecular configurations and so on.&#160; In this work, host&#8208;guest composite material Ln&#8208;NH2BDC&#8208;pbpy MOFs are constructed by encapsulating viologen derivative pbpyCl2. &#160;The pbpy2+ moieties is uniformly embed by their &#960;&#8208;&#960; conjugation in the pores of the 3D structure with electrostatic interaction. &#160;Due to the encapsulation of the chromophore pbpy2+ moieties, the Ln&#8208;NH2BDC&#8208;pbpy MOFs exhibit reversible photochromic properties which can change color after irradiation, and can restore the original color after being protected from light or heating. &#160;Interestingly, the fluorescence intensity decreases with illumination time and recovers under dark conditions. &#160;As a result, the Ln&#8208;NH2BDC&#8208;pbpy MOFs have the performance of both photochromic and photomodulated fluorescence. &#160;Based on the outstanding fluorescence performance of the Ln&#8208;NH2BDC&#8208;pbpy MOFs, they also show wonderful detection effect on nitrophenols especially for TNP.</dc:description>

         <title>Overclocking nitronyl nitroxide gold derivatives in cross&#8208;coupling reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitronyl nitroxides are functional building blocks in cutting&#8208;edge research fields, such as the design of molecular magnets, the development of redox and photoswitchable molecular systems and the creation of redox&#8208;active components for organic and hybrid batteries. The key importance of the nitronyl nitroxide function is to translate molecular&#8208;level&#8208;optimized structures into nano&#8208;scale devices and new technologies. In spite of great importance, efficient and versatile synthetic approaches to these compounds still represent a challenge. Particularly, methods for the direct introduction of a nitronyl nitroxide moiety into aromatic systems possess many limitations. Here, we report gold derivatives of nitronyl nitroxide that can enter Pd(0)&#8208;catalysed cross&#8208;coupling reactions with various aryl bromides, affording the corresponding functionalized nitronyl nitroxides. Based on the high thermal stability and enhanced reactivity in catalytic transformation, a new reagent is suggested for the synthesis of radical systems via a universal cross&#8208;coupling approach.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Solvothermal reactions of CoCl2&#8226;6H2O, 3,5&#8208;pyridinedicarboxylic acid (H2L) and isonicotinic acid (HL1)/3&#8208;amino isonicotinic acid (HL2)/3&#8208;chloro isonicotinic acid (HL3) successfully led to three tfz&#8208;d topological pillar&#8208;layer [Co4(&#956;&#8208;F)2(COO)6(NC5H4)4] cluster&#8208;based MOFs, namely, [Co4(&#956;&#8208;F)2(L)2(L1)2&#8226;2DMA]&#8226;DMA&#8226;2H2O (SNNU&#8208;Bai76, SNNU&#8208;Bai = Shaanxi Normal University Bai&#8217;s group), [Co4(&#956;&#8208;F)2(L)2(L2)2&#8226;2H2O]&#8226;2DMA&#8226;2H2O (SNNU&#8208;Bai77) and [Co4(&#956;&#8208;F)2(L)2(L3)2&#8226;2H2O]&#8226;2DMF&#8226;2H2O (SNNU&#8208;Bai78). With 2D pore channels in SNNU&#8208;Bai76 and SNNU&#8208;Bai77 being tuned to the 1D pore channel in SNNU&#8208;Bai78, C3H8 and C2H6 adsorption uptakes are apparently improved and&#160;IAST selectivities of C3H8/CH4 and C2H6/CH4 are almost remained, which indicate that SNNU&#8208;Bai78 may be one potential separation material for the pipeline natural gas purification. These were further confirmed by breakthrough experiments for the simulated pipeline natural gas (C3H8/C2H6/CH4:5/10/85 gas mixture) of three isostructural MOFs. Furthermore, GCMC simulations revealed that due to one of the pore channels blocked by Cl atoms in a couple of 3&#8208;chloro isonicotinic acid with the changed conformation as the pillar, the pore wall of the formed 1D pore channel in SNNU&#8208;Bai78 may interact with the adsorbed C3H8 or C2H6 molecule more strongly, for which more atoms of framework at the new adsorption site will interact with the adsorbed gas molecule by more intermolecular interactions. This was also evidenced by the increased binding energies, being consistent with the tuning of adsorption enthalpies for C3H8 and C2H6 gas molecules, and the reduced C3H8 and C2H6 gas diffusion coefficients in SNNU&#8208;Bai78. Very interestingly, this work is the first example of finely tuning the pore connectivity of MOFs toward strengthened host&#8208;guest interactions for the gas adsorption and separation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>By applying the potassium salts of cyclopentadienyl&#8208;phosphine ligands LK to CoCl 2 , the corresponding cobalt chlorides ( 1 , L Co(II)Cl) were prepared. By reducing complexes 1 with KHBEt 3 under N 2 atmosphere, bridging end&#8208;on complexes, L Co(I)&#8208;N 2 &#8208;Co(I) L ( 2a and 2b ), were obtained successfully. 15 N 2 &#8208;labeled 2a &#8208; 15 N 2 was prepared under 15 N 2 / 14 N 2 exchange in THF solution. L Co(I)&#8208;N 2 &#8208;Co(I) L complex 2a could react with P 4 molecules to release N 2 and generate a&#160;Co&#8208;P 4 &#8208;Co moiety 4 . Further reduction of complex 2b led to cleavage of a P&#8208;C bond in the cyclopentadienyl&#8208;phosphine ligand, while novel &#181; &#8208;PCy 2 bridged Co(0)&#8208;N 2 complex 5 was provided.

         <title>Coordination of Pnictogenylboranes towards Tl(I) salts and a Tl&#8208; mediated P&#8208;P coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The coordination chemistry of only Lewis&#8208;base (LB)stabilized pnictogenylboranes EH2BH2 &#183; NMe 3  (E = P, As) towards Tl(I) salts has been studied. The reaction of Tl[BArCl] (BArCl = [B(3,5C6H3Cl2)4]&#8208;) with the corresponding pnictogenylborane results in the formation of [Tl(EH2BH2&#183;NMe3)][BArCl] (1a: E = P; 1b: E = As). Whereas the Tl ion in 1a/b is monocoordinated, the exchange of the weakly coordinating anion (WCA) in the Tl(I) salt leads to the formation of a trigonal pyramidal coordination mode at the Tl atom by coordination of three equivalents of EH2BH2 &#183; NMe3 in [Tl(EH2BH2 &#183; NMe3)3][WCA] (2a: E = P, WCA = TEFCl; 2b: E = As, WCA = TEF) (TEF = [Al{OC(CF3)3}4]&#8208;, TEFCl = [Al{(OC(CF3)2(CCl3)}4]&#8208;). Furthermore, by using two equivalents of PH2BH2&#183;NMe 3 , a Tl(I)&#8208;mediated P&#8208;P coupling takes place in CH2Cl2 as solvent resulting in [Me3N &#183; BH2PH2PHBH2 &#183; NMe3][WCA] (WCA = TEF, 3a; BArCl, 3b; TEFCl, 3c). In contrast, for the arsenic derivatives 1b and 2b, no coupling reaction is observed. The underlying chemical processes are elucidated by quantum chemical computations.</dc:description>

         <title>Modeling Type&#8208;1 Iodothyronine Deiodinase with Peptide&#8208;Based Aliphatic Diselenides: Potential Role of Highly Conserved His and Cys Residues as a General Acid Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Type&#8208;1 iodothyronine deiodinase (ID&#8208;1) catalyzes the reductive elimination of 5'&#8208;I and 5&#8208;I on the phenolic and tyrosyl rings of thyroxine (T4), respectively. Chemically verifying whether I atoms with different chemical properties undergo deiodination through a common mechanism is challenging. Herein, we report the modeling of ID&#8208;1 using aliphatic diselenide (Se&#8211;Se) and selenenylsulfide (Se&#8210;S) compounds. Mechanistic investigations of deiodination using the ID&#8208;1&#8208;like reagents suggested that the 5'&#8208;I and 5&#8208;I deiodinations proceed via the same mechanism through an unstable intermediate containing a Se&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;I halogen bond between a selenolate anion, reductively produced from Se&#8210;Se (or Se&#8210;S) in the compound, and an I atom in T4. Moreover, imidazolium and thiol groups, which may act as general acid catalysts, promoted the heterolytic cleavage of the C&#8210;I bond in the Se&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;I intermediate, which is the rate&#8208;determining step, by donating a proton to the C atom.</dc:description>

         <title>Activated Single Phase Ti4O7 Nanosheets with Efficient Utilization of Precious Metal for Inspired Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is central to modern energy storage and conversion technologies for grid such as fuel cells and electrolysers, but challenges remain due to the lack of reliable, economic, and durable electrocatalysts. Here, we develop single crystal conductive black titanium (Ti  4  O  7  ) nanosheets (NSs) as a new precious metal carrier based on sacrificial hard templates and ultrasonic&#8208;assisted peeling, and deposit Pt clusters on the Ti  4  O  7  NSs induced by wetness impregnation under the irradiation of visible light (VI; 650 nm). Pt/Ti  4  O  7  NSs provide Ti  3+  , Pt  2+  , and Pt  0+  continuous active sites for the ORR multi&#8208;electron process, achieving synergy among them. The assistance of visible light not only makes more uniformly and smaller distribution of Pt nanoclusters, but also strengthens the charge transfer, constructing a strong metal&#8208;support interaction interface. VI&#8208;Pt/Ti  4  O  7  NSs show superior initial oxidation potential and mass activity of 1.61 A mg  &#8208;1  Pt  at a E  1/2  = 0.91 V, which is 9 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C. This work provides an effective strategy for achieving high&#8208;value applications of titanium sub&#8208;oxides and further explores the enhanced&#8208;interface in metals&#8208;Ti  n  O  2n&#8208;1  by light radiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Hijacking the Peptidoglycan Recycling Pathway of Escherichia coli to Produce Muropeptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Soluble fragments of peptidoglycan called muropeptides are released from the cell wall of bacteria as part of their metabolism or as a result of biological stresses. These compounds trigger immune responses in mammals and plants. In bacteria, they play a major role in the induction of antibiotic resistance. The development of efficient methods to produce muropeptides is therefore desirable both to address their mechanism of action and to design new antibacterial and immunostimulant agents. Here, we engineered the peptidoglycan recycling pathway of Escherichia coli to produce N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;glucosaminyl&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;1,6&#8208;anhydro&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;muramic acid (GlcNAc&#8208;anhMurNAc), a common precursor of Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive muropeptides. Inactivation of the hexosaminidase nagZ gene allowed the efficient production of this key disaccharide, providing access to Gram&#8208;positive muropeptides through subsequent chemical peptide conjugation. E. coli strains deficient in both NagZ hexosaminidase and amidase activities further enabled the in vivo production of Gram&#8208;negative muropeptides containing meso&#8208;diaminopimelic acid, a rarely available amino acid.</dc:description>

         <title>A Small&#8208;Molecule Probe with a Dual Function of miRNA Inhibition and Target identification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By virtue of their key roles in&#160;pathologies,&#160;miRNAs&#160;represent a promising class of therapeutic targets.&#160;While high&#8208;fidelity small&#8208;molecule modulators of miRNAs can be identified&#160;via&#160;high&#8208;throughput screening using cellular reporter systems, their modes of action are elusive due to the lack of proper tools. Here, we report a small&#8208;molecule probe, 1a, that is capable of elucidating its biological target along miRNA inhibition. Derived from norathyriol, a nature product, 1a possessed a bioorthogonal alkyne moiety for subsequent labeling&#160;via&#160;copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition chemistry. We demonstrated that 1a inhibited a panel of different miRNAs by blocking their loading onto argonaute 2 (AGO2), which is the key protein responsible for miRNA function. With the alkyne handle, we successfully identified AGO2 as an intracellular target of 1a. Therefore, this work presents a novel small&#8208;molecule tool for suppressing and probing miRNA regulatory pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Interactions between Brilliant Green and MscL Investigated by Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy and Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mechanosensitive ion channel of large conductance (MscL) is a promising template for the development of new antibiotics due to its high conservation and uniqueness to microbes. Brilliant green (BG), a triarylmethane dye, has been identified as a new antibiotic targeting MscL. However, the detailed binding sites of BG to MscL and the dynamic pathway of BG through the MscL channel remain unknown. Here, we investigated the dynamic interactions between BG and MscL using solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and molecule dynamics (MD) simulations. We identified residue site&#8208;specific binding sites of BG to the MscL channel by solid&#8208;state NMR. In addition, MD simulations revealed that BG conducts through the MscL channel via residues along the inner surface of the pore sequentially, in which the strong hydrophobic interactions between BG and hydrophobic residues F23 and I27 in the hydrophobic gate region of the MscL channel are major restrictions. Particularly, we demonstrated that BG activates the MscL channel by reducing the hydrophobicity of the F23 in the gate region by water molecules that are bound to BG. Taken together, these simulations and experimental data provide novel insights into the dynamic interactions between BG and MscL, based on which we can develop new hydrophobic antibiotics and adjuvants targeting MscL.</dc:description>

In addition, MD simulations revealed that BG conducts through the MscL channel via residues along the inner surface of the pore sequentially, in which the strong hydrophobic interactions between BG and hydrophobic residues F23 and I27 in the hydrophobic gate region of the MscL channel are major restrictions. Particularly, we demonstrated that BG activates the MscL channel by reducing the hydrophobicity of the F23 in the gate region by water molecules that are bound to BG. Taken together, these simulations and experimental data provide novel insights into the dynamic interactions between BG and MscL, based on which we can develop new hydrophobic antibiotics and adjuvants targeting MscL.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interfacial C&#8722;S bonds of g&#8208;C3N4/Bi19Br3S27 S&#8208;scheme heterojunction for enhanced photocatalytic CO2 reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Step&#8208;scheme (S&#8208;scheme) heterojunctions have been extensively studied in photocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction due to their excellent charge separation and high redox ability. The built&#8208;in electric field at the interface of S&#8208;scheme heterojunction serves as the driving force for charge transfer, however, the poor interfacial contact greatly restricts the carrier migration rate. Herein, we synthesized g&#8208;C3N4/Bi19Br3S27 S&#8208;scheme heterostructure through in&#8208;situ deposition of Bi19Br3S27 (BBS) on porous g&#8208;C3N4 (P&#8208;CN) nanosheets. The C&#8722;S bonds formed at the interface help to enhance the built&#8208;in electric field, thereby promoting the charge transfer and separation. As a result, the CO2 reduction reaction performance of 10%Bi19Br3S27/g&#8208;C3N4 (BBS/P&#8208;CN) reaches 32.78 &#956;mol g&#8722;1h&#8722;1, which is 341.4 and 18.7 times higher than that of pure BBS and P&#8208;CN, respectively. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT&#8208;IR) prove the presence of chemical bonds (C&#8722;S) between the P&#8208;CN and BBS. The S&#8208;scheme charge transfer mechanism was analyzed via XPS and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work provides a new idea for designing heterojunction photocatalysts with interfacial chemical bonds to achieve high charge transfer and catalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Roundabout of Four&#8208;Point&#8208;Star Tiles with the Core Arm Length of Three Half&#8208;Turns for 2D DNA Arrays</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By rationally adjusting the weaving modes of point&#8208;star tiles, the curvature inherent in the tiles can be changed, and various DNA nanostructures can be assembled, such as planar wireframe meshes, perforated wireframe tubes, and curved wireframe polyhedra. Based on the weaving and tiling architectures for traditional point&#8208;star tiles with the core arm length at two DNA half&#8208;turns, we improved the weaving modes of our newly reported four&#8208;point&#8208;star tiles with the core arm length at three half&#8208;turns to adjust their curvature and rigidity for assembling 2D arrays of DNA grids and tubes. Following our previous terms and methods to analyze the structural details of E&#8208;tiling tubes, we used the chiral indices (n,m) to describe the most abundant tube of typical assemblies; especially, we applied both one&#8208;locus and/or dual&#8208;locus biotin/streptavidin (SA) labeling strategies to define the configurations of two specific tubes, along with the absolute conformations of their component tiles. Such structural details of the DNA tubes composed of tiles with addressable concave and convex faces and packing directions should help us understand their physio&#8208;chemical and biological properties, and therefore promote their applications in drug delivery, biocatalysis, biomedicine, etc.</dc:description>

         <title>Orthogonal Crosslinking: A Strategy to Generate Novel Protein Topology and Function</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compared to the disulfide bond, other naturally occurring intramolecular crosslinks have received little attention, presumably due to their rarity in vast protein space. Here we presented examples of natural non&#8208;disulfide crosslinks, which we refer to as orthogonal crosslinks, emphasizing their effect on protein topology and function. We summarized recent efforts on expanding orthogonal crosslinks using either the enzymes that catalyze protein circularization or the genetic code expansion strategy to add electrophilic amino acids site&#8208;specifically in proteins. The advantages and disadvantages of each method were discussed, along with their applications to generate novel protein topology and function. In particular, we highlighted our recent work on spontaneous orthogonal crosslinking, in which a carbamate&#8208;based crosslink was generated in situ, and its applications in designing orthogonally crosslinked domain antibodies with their topology mimicking bacterial adhesins.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbonyl&#8208;Containing Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters for Narrowband Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbonyl&#8208;containing derivatives show enduring vitality in the field of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials, which can realize high device efficiency by utilizing both singlet and triplet excitons for electroluminescence. And recently, the based on fused ketone/amine system exhibited huge potential for constructing multi resonance TADF (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters, which exhibit higher superiority for narrowband emission compared with conventional TADF emitters with twisted donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) structure. Herein, we summarized the current research progress of both traditional and MR types ketone derivatives with TADF characteristics for introducing the involved molecular design strategy of holding high&#8208;device efficiency and keeping narrowband emission profile simultaneously. We hope this review can inspire the emergence of more high&#8208;performance narrowband materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Advanced Covalent Organic Frameworks for Multi Valent Metal Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have received increased interest in recent years as an advanced class of materials. By virtue of the available monomers, multiple conformations and various linkages, COFs offer a wide range of opportunities for complex structural design and specific functional development of materials, which has facilitated the widespread application in many fields, including multi valent metal ion batteries (MVMIBs), described as the attractive candidate replacing lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). With their robust skeletons, diverse pores, flexible structures and abundant functional groups, COFs are expected to help realize a high performance MVMIBs. In this review, we present an overview of COFs, describe advances in topology design and synthetic reactions, and study the application of COFs in MVMIBs, as well as discuss challenges and solutions in the preparation of COFs electrodes, in the hope of providing constructive insights into the future direction of COFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Photocatalytic Performance of Ruthenium (II) Polypyridine Complexes Via Ligand Modification for Visible&#8208;Light Induced Phosphorylation of Tertiary Aliphatic Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tuning the redox potential of commonly available photocatalyst to improve the catalytic performance or expand its scope for challenging synthetic conversions is an ongoing demand in synthetic chemistry. Herein, we tuned the excited state properties and redox potential of commercially available [Ru(bpy)3]2+ photocatalyst by modifying the structure of the bipyridine ligands with electron&#8208;donating/withdrawing units. We demonstrate the visible light&#8208;mediated photoredox phosphorylation of tertiary aliphatic amines under mild conditions. A series of cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reactions were performed employing the RuII complexes as photocatalyst yielding the corresponding &#945;&#8208;aminophosphinoxides and &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonates via C&#8722;P bond formation.</dc:description>
