         <title>Intepirdine Derivatives Possessing Dual 5HT6 Antagonism / HDAC6 Inhibitory Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the context of developing therapies for dementias and cognitive decline, potent dual acting molecules targeting the GPCR 5HT6 and the enzyme HDAC6 with favorable BBB penetration profile were designed and synthesised.








Abstract
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) impacts significantly the quality of life of people aged over 65 years old, while millions more suffer from other types of dementia, yet no effective drugs exist. The few approved drugs in this area address mostly the associated symptoms, while several selective agents acting on promising targets have failed in clinical trials. The complexity of neurodegenerative diseases has prompted multitargeting ligands as the new paradigm, where more than one biological mechanism may be perturbed synergistically. In this context, we explored the design and synthesis of dual 5&#8208;&#919;&#932;6&#160;antagonists / HDAC6 inhibitors since these actions have been individually demonstrated to elicit cognitive&#8208;enhancing effects. Prototypes with this dual action on a GPCR and an enzyme were designed and synthesized by tethering an aryl&#8208;hydroxamic acid unit, an established pharmacophore for HDAC6 inhibition, to the piperazine of intepirdine, a potent 5&#8208;&#919;&#932;6&#160;antagonist.&#160;A new gram&#8208;scale synthesis of intepirdine was&#160;developed&#160;followed&#160;by&#160;attaching&#160;different types of arylhydroxamic acids.&#160;Derivative RG&#8208;283AG emerged to possess sub&#8208;micromolar potency toward HDAC6 inhibition (IC50&#160;0.54 &#956;&#956;), nanomolar affinity (Ki&#160;0.7&#160;nM) for 5&#8208;HT6&#160;receptor and favorable BBB penetration capacity, thus constituting the first example of a dual&#8208;acting 5&#8208;&#919;&#932;6&#160;/ HDAC6 ligand with potential cognitive&#8208;enhancing properties.

         <title>Ru(II)&#8208;Based Photo&#8208;Antibiotics: Light&#8208;Driven Eradication of Bacterial Biofilm and Rapid Healing of Infective Wounds in Wistar Rat</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the development of biocompatible&#160;Ru(II)&#8208;based photo&#8208;antibiotics that increase oxidative stress via ROS generation (both type I and type II pathways) and NADH oxidation, killing bacterial cells and eradicating bacterial biofilm with a novel mechanism. Moreover, the lead photo&#8208;antibiotics eradicated the gram&#8208;negative bacterial colony from the infected wounds in a rat model within 3 days and healed the wound completely within 9 days, bridging the gap between aPDT outcomes and clinical trials.








Abstract
Three novel Ru(II)&#8208;based photoantibiotics,&#160;viz., [Ru(phtpy)(N,N,N)2](PF6)2, where N,N,N&#160;=&#160;4&#8242;&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8243;&#8208;terpyridine (phtpy, Ru1), 4&#8208;([2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridin]&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;yl)&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethylaniline (NMe2tpy, Ru2), trifluoromethylphenyl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine (CF3tpy, Ru3) were developed with excellent photostability for visible light&#8208;activated antibacterial activities and infective wound healing. Ru1&#8208;Ru3&#160;exhibited an absorption in the 400&#8211;600&#160;nm range, beneficial for antibacterial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) application. Upon visible light exposure (400&#8208;700&#160;nm),&#160;Ru1&#8208;Ru3&#160;inhibited bacterial growth of Escherichia coli (E. coli), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), and Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis), due to the effects of oxidative stress via ROS generation and photo&#8208;oxidation of NADH. Ru3 was identified as a lead antibiotic that further showed antibiofilm activities against E. coli under visible light exposure. Ru3 was found to be biocompatible against rat red blood cells and human embryonic kidney cells. Ru3&#160;+&#160;light promoted rapid healing of infected wounds within 9 days in an E. coli&#8208;induced rat model, highlighting its potential future use in healthcare.

         <title>Substrate Epoxidation Catalyzed by the Nonheme Iron Dioxygenase Dapdiamide Biosynthesis Enzyme C. Why Is the Substrate Tethered?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work a computational study shows the differences in binding and catalysis of a nonheme iron oxygenase with tethered versus nontethered substrate. The tethered substrate is positioned in an ideal orientation near the active site, while the nontethered substrate shows more dynamics and is not positioned well for double bond epoxidation.









Abstract
Enzymes usually react with a free substrate, although some examples have appeared in the literature of enzymes that utilize a substrate tethered to a protein carrier. However, it is not clear what advantage the tethering has, and therefore a computational study was performed. In particular, we report here the first computational study on the nonheme iron dioxygenase involved in the epoxidation reaction during the dapdiamide biosynthesis (DdaC) and investigate tethered and nontethered substrates. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations show that the protein carrier applies pressure onto the surface of the protein and influences the fold and active site description and leads to differences in substrate&#8208;oxidant interactions. Quantum chemical calculations give much lower epoxidation barriers for the activation of the tethered substrate by 7&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1 over the nontethered substrate and highlight the advantage of a tethered substrate in catalysis.

         <title>Nucleoside Reactions Shed Light on the Chemical Processes Underlying Interstrand Cross&#8208;Link Formation at Apurinic/Apyrimidinic Sites in Duplex DNA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites in DNA can give rise to interstrand cross&#8208;links via reactions of the ring&#8208;opened AP&#8208;aldehyde residue with the exocyclic amino groups of 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine, 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyguanosine, and 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxycytosine residues (dA, dG, and dC) on the opposing strand to give imine/N&#8208;glycosylamine linkages. Endogenous AP&#8208;derived cross&#8208;links in cellular DNA could contribute to cancer, aging, and neurodegeneration. The yields of AP&#8208;derived cross&#8208;links produced by the various nucleobases vary widely, and, until now, it remained unclear whether these differences might simply reflect differences in the inherent reactivities of the nucleobases. To shed light on this question, we examined reactions of a nucleosidic AP model compound, 3,5&#8208;bis&#8208;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;ribofuranose (1), with the canonical nucleosides (dA, dG, and dC) and the noncanonical nucleoside, 2&#8208;aminopurine&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyriboside (2AP). The trends observed for the equilibrium yields of the nucleoside cross&#8208;links did not mirror yields of the respective cross&#8208;links observed in the context of duplex DNA. The results provide evidence that the inherent reactivity of the nucleobases alone does not determine yields of AP&#8208;derived cross&#8208;links in duplex DNA. Rather, the differences in yields for the various AP&#8208;derived cross&#8208;links must reflect effects exerted by the 3D structure of double helical DNA on the cross&#8208;linking processes.

         <title>Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Multi&#8208;Carbon Products</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent progress in photocatalytic CO2 reduction toward multi&#8208;carbon products, emphasizing key advances in catalyst design. Strategies including atomic site dispersion, co&#8208;catalyst integration, defect engineering, and utilization of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) are discussed to promote C&#8211;C coupling, offering insights into selective solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion.








Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction represents a sustainable pathway for mitigating carbon emissions and producing renewable chemicals by utilizing solar energy. While extensive research has been dedicated to single&#8208;carbon (C1) products, the selective formation of multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) compounds, such as ethylene, ethane, ethanol and acetic acid, has garnered increasing attention due to their higher energy density and broader industrial relevance. However, achieving efficient C&#9472;C coupling under mild photocatalytic conditions remains a formidable challenge, hindered by complex reaction pathways, sluggish kinetics and competitive side reactions. In this review, recent advances in photocatalytic CO2 reduction to C2+ products was systematically summarized, focusing on fundamental reaction mechanisms, rational photocatalyst design strategies, including atomically dispersed active sites, cocatalyst loading, defect engineering, and localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). By bridging mechanistic understanding with materials innovation, this review provides a comprehensive framework for guiding the development of next&#8208;generation photocatalytic systems for efficient and selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ conversion, contributing to sustainable carbon utilization and circular chemical economy.

         <dc:description>
This study presents the synthesis, physical characterization, and transport as well as electrochemical properties of a novel class of ten ionic liquids (ILs). The ILs are created with two biomass derived anions such as furan&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylate [FuA] and tetrahydrofuran&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylate [HFuA] coupled to a range of nitrogen heterocyclic cations, for which the nature of cation controlled their transport and electrochemical properties. 








Abstract
Here we present the synthesis, physical characterization, and transport as well as electrochemical properties of a novel class of ten ionic liquids (ILs) derived from biomass. Two biomass derived anions such as furan&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylate [FuA] and tetrahydrofuran&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylate [HFuA] are coupled to a range of nitrogen heterocyclic cations to create the ILs, for which the nature of cation controlled their properties. For instance, the thermal decomposition temperature ranges from 183 to 259&#160;&#176;C, the glass transition temperature from&#160;&#8722;&#160;47 to&#160;&#8722;&#160;70&#160;&#176;C, and the ionic conductivity from 0.002 to 1.4 mS cm&#8722;1 at 20&#160;&#176;C. The supercapacitors prepared using [EPy][FuA] and [EMPip][FuA] exhibited specific capacitances of 99 F g&#8722;1 and 70 F g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1, respectively. The [EPy][FuA]&#8208;based supercapacitor achieved an energy density of 56&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 as well as a power density of 410&#160;W kg&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1, while the [EMPip][FuA]&#8208;based supercapacitor achieved an energy density of 36&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and a power density of 360&#160;W kg&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1. In addition, the supercapacitors retained 98% and 94% of their initial capacitances after 6000 cycles, for [EPy][FuA] and [EMPip][FuA] electrolytes, respectively.

         <title>Graphene Quantum Dots Drive Spontaneous Metal Reduction to Form Stable and Electroactive Core&#8208;Shell Nanocolloids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a spontaneous synthesis of metal (Au, Pt, and Ag) enveloped by crystalline graphene&#8208;quantum dots (GQDs). Aromatic and functional sp2 and sp3 hybridized carbons, within the GQDs shell, play a crucial role upon the synthesis, electronic distribution at the interface, and conductive sites for improving the electrocatalytic response. Au nanohybrids demonstrated two&#8208;fold increase in current density with respect to conventional citrate&#8208;coated Au nanoparticles. This was attributed to conductive sp2&#8208;carbons at the shell and the gain of charge electron density at the surface of Au as demonstrated by DFT calculations.








Abstract
This work demonstrates a spontaneous synthesis of &#8764;8.0, &#8764;7.0, and &#8764;3.0&#160;nm diameter Au, Ag, and Pt cores; respectively, wrapped by as&#8208;synthesized crystalline graphene&#8208;quantum dots (GQDs). Functional sp2&#8208; and sp3&#8208;hybridized carbons play a crucial role upon the synthesis, electronic distribution at the interface, and conductive sites for improving the electrocatalytic response. Au nanohybrids (NHs) demonstrated two&#8208;fold increase in current density with respect to conventional citrate&#8208;coated Au nanoparticles. This was attributed to conductive sp2&#8208; hybridized carbons and the gain of charge density at the surface of Au as demonstrated by DFT calculations. Due to the sp3&#8208;carbons at the shell, these NHs also behave like simple chemical compounds because they can be precipitated, stored for long periods of time, and redispersed without apparent changes in their properties. The resultant nanocolloids exhibit exceptional stability under harsh conditions. These attributes make them useful NHs with great potential for broad applications.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Photothermal Conversion in Spin Crossover Metal&#8208;organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

The NIR&#8208;II photothermal conversion properties of SCO metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are investigated for the first time, offering novel insights into the development of intelligent multifunctional materials.








Abstract
The synthesis of multifunctional materials that exhibit two or more distinct physicochemical properties is critical for the development of advanced smart materials. To date, the research regarding the near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) photothermal properties of spin crossover (SCO) materials remains scarce. Here, we synthesized an inverse&#8208;Hofmann&#8208;type cationic framework, [Fe{Ag(CN)2}(TTF(py)4)]+ (1, TTF(py)4&#160;=&#160;tetra(4&#8208;pyridyl)tetrathiafulvalene), which exhibits hysteretic SCO behavior. By introducing p&#8208;aminoazobenzene (Azo&#8208;NH2) and pyrene (Pyr) into 1, two solvent&#8208;free derivatives, 1@Azo&#8208;NH2 and 1@Pyr, incorporating free radicals were generated. NIR&#8208;II photothermal experiments revealed the outstanding photothermal properties of 1@Azo&#8208;NH2 and 1@Pyr under 1064&#160;nm laser irradiation. Solar&#8208;driven water evaporation experiment demonstrated that 1@Pyr achieved a water evaporation rate of 0.9197&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 with an efficiency of 63.9%. This represents the first demonstration of outstanding NIR&#8208;II photothermal conversion performance in an inverse&#8208;Hofmann&#8208;type metal&#8208;organic framework incorporating free radicals generated through host&#8208;guest interactions. Our findings underscore the critical importance of incorporating NIR absorption units into SCO systems, providing new insights for the development of intelligent multifunctional materials.

The impact of purine, 7&#8208;deazapurine and 8&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deazapurine heterocyclic skeletons on the stability of the xanthine&#8208;2&#8208;aminoadenine base pair is reported. In view of stability and pH dependence, the 7&#8208;deazaxanthine &#8211; 2&#8208;amino&#8208;8&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine pair is superior to other combinations.

Abstract
The impact of purine, 7&#8208;deazapurine and 8&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deazapurine heterocyclic skeletons on the stability of the xanthine&#8208;2&#8208;aminoadenine base pair is reported. Beyond that, base&#8208;pairing of xanthine nucleosides opposite canonical nucleobases is studied. To this end, a building block of 8&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deaza&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyxanthosine was prepared using 8&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deaza&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyguanosine as starting material. A simplified synthesis for large&#8208;scale production is presented for the phosphoramidite of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;7&#8208;bromo&#8208;7&#8208;deaza&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine (2&#8208;NH2Br7c7z8Ad). Hybridization of oligonucleotides gave duplexes containing single or multiple incorporations of xanthine&#8208;2&#8208;aminoadenine base pairs with different combinations of nucleobases. From melting curves and Tm values, it became apparent that the most stable duplexes contained base pairs of 2&#8208;NH2Br7c7z8Ad with xanthine nucleosides. Under these, the 7&#8208;deazaxanthine&#8208;2&#8208;NH2Br7c7z8Ad base pair reached the stability of dT&#8208;2&#8208;NH2Br7c7z8Ad and dG&#8208;dC pairs. 7&#8208;Deazaxanthine located opposite 2&#8208;aminoadenine residues resulted in higher duplex stability compared to xanthine or 8&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deazaxanthine. For 2&#8208;aminoadenine residues, the base pair stability followed the order 2&#8208;amino&#8208;8&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;bromo&#8208;7&#8208;deazaadenine&#160;&gt;&#160;2&#8208;aminoadenine&#160;&gt;&#160;7&#8208;deazaadenine. The impact of pK values became obvious from the increased stability of xanthine&#8208;2&#8208;aminoadenine pairs by decreasing the pH. Single incorporations of xanthine residues opposite canonical nucleobases displayed inhomogeneous pairing properties. Tracts of three xanthine residues in front of adenine and guanine furnished stable duplexes, whereas with cytosine and thymine, duplex formation was hindered.

         <title>Front Cover: A Diverse Array of Catalytic Photoredox Reactions Based on Aluminum(III)&#8208;Salen Complexes: Understanding the Enhancement of Catalytic Activity via Amine Association</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 46, August 18, 2025. </description>

Teaming up with an amine and visible light, an Al&#8211;salen complex drives diverse photoredox reactions via the single&#8208;electron reduction of aryl chlorides. Transient absorption studies suggested that the Al&#8211;salen complex associates with the amine via its vacant site, thus enhancing the reducing power of its excited state. This catalytic system enables hydrodechlorination, reductive carbonyl coupling, and defluoroallylation of perfluoroarenes, rivaling the performance of precious metal catalysts. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y. Nishimoto, M. Yasuda and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202501753).

The functionalization of protein N&#8208;terminal positions has significantly advanced the field of chemical biology, enabling the development of therapeutic proteins and functionalized materials. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current chemical and enzymatic tools available for protein N&#8208;terminal modification, along with a critical analysis of their strengths, limitations, and emerging opportunities in this rapidly evolving field.








Abstract
Site&#8208;specific modification of protein termini, particularly the N&#8208;terminus, has emerged as a cornerstone of chemical biology and biotechnology, facilitating the engineering of therapeutic proteins and functional biomaterials. The N&#8208;terminus, with its solvent&#8208;exposed &#945;&#8208;amino group and minimal disruption to protein folding, provides an ideal platform for the introduction of diverse functional groups into proteins. This review offers a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in chemical and enzymatic strategies for protein N&#8208;terminal modification and discusses the advantages, limitations, and applications of these approaches. These advances highlight the transformative potential of protein N&#8208;terminal modification in advancing medical therapeutics and biotechnology innovations. Future efforts are poised to integrate artificial intelligence with bioorthogonal chemistry to further expand the toolbox and explore new applications in basic research and drug development.

         <title>Enhanced Reactivity of N&#8208;heterocyclic Halophosphines and Phosphenium Cations: The Activation of Carbon&#9472;Heteroatom and Boron&#9472;Heteroatom Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 46, August 18, 2025. </description>

Novel class of saturated NHPs with phosphoramidothioate substituents exhibit enhanced reactivity in photoinitiated transfer hydrogenation reactions and activate C&#9472;O, B&#9472;H, B&#9472;C, and B&#9472;F bonds via phosphenium cation formation.








Abstract
N&#8208;heterocyclic phosphines (NHPs), and especially their ionic derivatives, phosphenium cations, have gained significant attention not only as isoelectronic species to N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) but mainly, as highly Lewis acidic, active organocatalysts. A novel type of saturated NHPs has been introduced, with the nitrogen atoms substituted by phosphoramidothioates&#8211;{[&#954;2&#8208;O,O&#8208;(OCH2C(Me)2CH2O)P(= S)]2&#8208;&#956;&#8208;[NCH2CH2N]}PX, where X&#160;=&#160;F, Cl, Br, I, H, Ph, and their derivatives. Thanks to an increased positive charge at the P(III) atom, these compounds are prone to activate C&#9472;O, B&#9472;H, B&#9472;C, or B&#9472;F bonds and open cyclic ethers through the formation of intermediate species&#8211;phosphenium cations. The hydrido derivative can effectively catalyze the transfer hydrogenation of azobenzene by ammonia borane when irradiated by UV light at room temperature. The self&#8208;ionization of the iodido derivative promoted by the coordination of less sterically demanding N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene enables the isolation of a phosphenium cation.

&lt;p&gt;Novel class of saturated NHPs with phosphoramidothioate substituents exhibit enhanced reactivity in photoinitiated transfer hydrogenation reactions and activate C&#9472;O, B&#9472;H, B&#9472;C, and B&#9472;F bonds via phosphenium cation formation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic phosphines (NHPs), and especially their ionic derivatives, phosphenium cations, have gained significant attention not only as isoelectronic species to &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) but mainly, as highly Lewis acidic, active organocatalysts. A novel type of saturated NHPs has been introduced, with the nitrogen atoms substituted by phosphoramidothioates&#8211;{[&#954;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-(OCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C(Me)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)P(= S)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-&#956;-[NCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N]}PX, where X&#160;=&#160;F, Cl, Br, I, H, Ph, and their derivatives. Thanks to an increased positive charge at the P(III) atom, these compounds are prone to activate C&#9472;O, B&#9472;H, B&#9472;C, or B&#9472;F bonds and open cyclic ethers through the formation of intermediate species&#8211;phosphenium cations. The hydrido derivative can effectively catalyze the transfer hydrogenation of azobenzene by ammonia borane when irradiated by UV light at room temperature. The self-ionization of the iodido derivative promoted by the coordination of less sterically demanding &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic carbene enables the isolation of a phosphenium cation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Rare&#8208;earth La&#8208;modulated NiFeP composites were prepared via a facile co&#8208;precipitation route followed by in situ phosphatization of La&#8208;doped NiFe&#8208;LDH precursors. Benefiting from the optimized electronic structure, the La0.3&#8208;NiFeP catalyst demonstrates remarkable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. In 1&#160;M KOH, this catalyst delivers 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at overpotentials of only 97&#160;mV (HER) and 271&#160;mV (OER), while demonstrating excellent operational durability. When configured as a dual&#8208;electrode water electrolyzer, La0.3&#8208;NiFeP divers overall water splitting at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with a low cell voltage of 1.59&#160;V and retains performance for over 24 hours, surpassing most reported transition metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts.

         <title>Optimization of Prodrug Activation by Enzymatic Cleavage of the &#946;&#8208;lactam Ring of Carbapenems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 46, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report synthetic routes that yield prodrugs consisting of two carbapenems connected by benzyl carbonate linkers. A mass spectrometry assay was elaborated to monitor, in a single kinetic experiment, the acylation of a bacterial target (a peptidoglycan transpeptidase) by these prodrugs, the resulting cleavage of the linker, and the release of their warhead moiety in an active form.








Abstract
&#946;&#8208;lactam antibiotics remain the best treatment to fight bacterial infections. Among various antibiotics used today, &#946;&#8208;lactams belonging to the carbapenem class are last resort drugs active against many multiresistant Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. Carbapenem antibiotics are prone to hydrolysis by certain &#946;&#8208;lactamases, leading to the opening of the &#946;&#8208;lactam ring and drug inactivation. This mechanism can be repurposed for targeted molecular fragmentation. Here, we report the synthesis of model prodrugs consisting of two carbapenems connected by original self&#8208;immolative linkers. A mass spectrometry assay was developed to simultaneously monitor acylation of a &#946;&#8208;lactam target by the prodrugs and by their sacrificial and warhead moieties. The linker connecting the two carbapenems was optimized with respect to prodrug stability and effective release of the activated warhead upon carbapenem ring opening.

         <title>Vacancy Engineering of Fe&#8208;Doped CoNi2S4@CC Boosting the Oxygen Evolution Reaction and Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 46, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have synthesized Fe&#8208;doped CoNi2S4@CC with sulfur vacancies (Fe&#8208;CoNi2S4&#8208;x@CC). The catalyst exhibited excellent OER and overall water splitting performance, which is attributed to the fact that vacancy engineering and iron doping synergistically promote charge transfer to enhance the catalyst performance.








Abstract
Transition metal sulfides have emerged as promising alternatives to precious metal catalysts for sustainable electrocatalytic hydrogen production. However, achieving simultaneous optimization of active site exposure and vacancy&#8208;electron interplay remains a critical challenge. Herein, we develop a dual&#8208;regulation strategy integrating Fe&#8208;doping and high&#8208;temperature annealing to synthesize sulfur&#8208;deficient Fe&#8208;doped CoNi2S4@CC nanocatalysts (Fe&#8208;CoNi2S4&#8208;x@CC). The approach innovatively combines heteroatom doping and vacancy engineering, where iron doping leads to lattice dilation and sulfur vacancies create vacancy defects, thereby exposing a large number of active sites. The designed catalysts have iron&#8208;induced charge redistribution and vacancy tailored adsorption energies synergistically in the dual active center and expose more active sites to accelerate charge transfer. Intriguingly, the Fe&#8208;CoNi2S4&#8208;x@CC achieves a low overpotential of 194.72 mV@10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in alkaline media, surpassing most reported CoNi&#8208;based sulfides. More remarkably, it demonstrates exceptional kinetics with a Tafel slope of 43.2&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 and enhanced active site utilization evidenced by its high electrochemical double layer capacitance value (31.3 mF cm&#8722;2). This work presents a significant advance for the rational design of high&#8208;performance OER catalysts by demonstrating a synergistic modulation strategy that integrates cation doping and vacancy engineering in Fe&#8208;doped CoNi2S4@CC, which not only optimizes the electronic structure but also increases the rate of charge transfer to enhance the catalytic activity.

         <title>A Diverse Array of Catalytic Photoredox Reactions Based on Aluminum(III)&#8208;Salen Complexes: Understanding the Enhancement of Catalytic Activity via Amine Association</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 46, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the diversity of the photoredox reactions based on Al&#8208;salen catalysts. The combination of an Al&#8208;salen catalyst with an amine under visible&#8208;light irradiation allowed the reductive transformations of aryl chlorides, carbonyl compounds, and perfluoroalkylarenes, and the oxidative transformations of amines. Mechanistic studies using transient absorption spectroscopy suggested that the Al&#8208;salen complex associates with the amine via its vacant site to improve its excited&#8208;state reducing power.








Abstract
Since aluminum is an earth&#8208;abundant and environmentally benign main&#8208;group metal, the development of aluminum&#8208;complex&#8208;based photoredox catalysts remains a significant issue. Herein, we report aluminum(III)&#8208;salen complexes (Al&#8208;salens) as versatile photoredox catalysts. The combination of an Al&#8208;salen catalyst with an amine under visible&#8208;light irradiation allowed the hydrodechlorinative transformations of aryl chlorides, the reductive coupling of carbonyl compounds, and the defluoroallylation of perfluoroalkylarenes. Mechanistic studies using transient absorption spectroscopy suggested that the Al&#8208;salen complex associates with the amine via its vacant site to improve the reducing ability of its excited state. After electron transfer between the excited state of the Al&#8208;salen/amine complex and an appropriate oxidant, the generated aminium radical cation is leveraged to achieve the oxidative transformations of amines, such as &#945;&#8208;arylation and &#945;&#8208;cyanation. The diversity of the catalytic photoredox reactions based on Al&#8208;salen complexes is comparable to that of heavy&#8208;precious&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts.

After electron transfer between the excited state of the Al-salen/amine complex and an appropriate oxidant, the generated aminium radical cation is leveraged to achieve the oxidative transformations of amines, such as &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-arylation and &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-cyanation. The diversity of the catalytic photoredox reactions based on Al-salen complexes is comparable to that of heavy-precious-metal-based catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Conversion of Bisphenol A Polycarbonate into Aliphatic Polycarbonate Polyols for Recyclable Polyurethane Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 46, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;step synthesis of aliphatic polycarbonate (APC) polyols via upcycling of bisphenol&#8208;A based polycarbonate (BPA&#8208;PC) is shown. These APC polyols were further utilized to produce thermoplastic polyurethanes that exhibit excellent chemical recyclability, enabling the simultaneous hydrolysis of both carbonate and urethane bonds.








Abstract
The growing accumulation of plastic waste emphasizes the pressing need for sustainable recycling technologies. In this study, we present a one&#8208;step conversion of bisphenol A&#8208; based polycarbonate (BPA&#8208;PC) waste into aliphatic polycarbonate (APC) polyols using diols with varying chain lengths. The resulting APC polyols were subsequently utilized as soft segments in combination with 4,4&#8242;&#8208;methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) in the production of thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPUs). These TPUs exhibited excellent mechanical properties, with a maximum tensile strength of 58&#160;MPa and elongation at break of 397%, as well as robust hydrolytic stability, maintaining performance even after prolonged water exposure. Notably, the APC&#8208;based TPUs exhibited excellent recyclability through organocatalytic depolymerization, which facilitated the simultaneous hydrolysis of both urethane and carbonate bonds. This process yielded the selective formation of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;methylenedianiline (MDA), an industrial precursor to MDI, and 1,4&#8208;butanediol (1,4&#8208;BD) with remarkably high yields of 96% and 95%, respectively. This work provides valuable insights into designing closed&#8208;loop recyclable polymers by upcycling plastic waste via a straightforward process. Additionally, it offers a practical and impactful solution for the end&#8208;of&#8208;life management of upcycled polyurethane products, thereby contributing to a circular plastic economy.

Although octupolar and quadrupolar DMAQ&#8208;derived probes showed superior &#949; and two&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;section (&#963;2) values relative to the dipolar one (1), the fragmentation efficiency exhibited inverse trend, and 1 emerged as the most effective caging group achieving Q&#160;=&#160;12% quantum yield with &#963;2&#160;=&#160;86 GM and uncaging cross&#8208;section &#948;u&#160;=&#160;10.2 GM at 735&#160;nm.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;branched probes based on 2&#8208;hydroxymethylene 8&#8208;dimethylaminoquinoline (8&#8208;DMAQ) and triphenylamine (TPA) have been synthesized and compared under UV and femtosecond near&#8208;infrared two&#8208;photon (2P) activation conditions. While octupolar (3) and quadrupolar (2) DMAQ derivatives showed superior &#949; and 2P absorption cross&#8208;section (&#963;2) values relative to the dipolar (1) probe, the fragmentation efficiency exhibited an inverse correlation with the enhanced absorption. Compound 1 emerged as the most effective probe reported to date for the release of organic substrates under both UV and 2P activation conditions at wavelengths accessible to commercially available lasers, achieving a quantum yield (Q) of 12% with &#963;2&#160;=&#160;86 GM and uncaging cross&#8208;section &#948;u&#160;=&#160;10.2 GM at 735&#160;nm.

         <title>Enhancing Photocatalytic Performance of Imine&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) through Grafting Methoxyl Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 46, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The methoxy&#8208;groups&#8208;grafted TMTA&#8208;DTM&#8208;COF has been demonstrated to show a narrower bandgap and better photoelectric performance, which can be used as an efficient photocatalyst for the conversion of phenyl boronic acids into phenols.








Abstract
Preparing imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with good stability and excellent photocatalytic performance is highly desirable. Herein, methoxy groups were successfully grafted on the skeleton of highly stable TTA&#8208;DTM&#8208;COF through monomer modification strategy. The as&#8208;prepared TMTA&#8208;DTM&#8208;COF has a narrower bandgap and better photoelectric performance, which can be used as an efficient photocatalyst for the conversion of phenyl boronic acids into phenols. Our studies showed that the conversion efficiency of phenyl boronic acids into phenols using TMTA&#8208;DTM&#8208;COF as a catalyst was 1.3 times higher than that with TTA&#8208;DTM&#8208;COF as a catalyst. In addition, TMTA&#8208;DTM&#8208;COF exhibits excellent recyclability and maintains high stability during cyclic tests. Our research demonstrates that grafting methoxyl groups could be a good strategy to stabilize COFs as efficient metal&#8208;free and heterogeneous catalysts for organic conversion.

         <title>Design, Synthesis, and Cytotoxic Evaluation of New Structurally Simplified and Highly Potent Third&#8208;Generation Tubulysin Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 46, August 18, 2025. </description>

We have developed the first solid&#8208;phase synthesis of novel third&#8208;generation tubulin inhibitors without tubuvaline and tubuphenylalanine fragments, earlier considered essential for anticancer activities. The simplified tubulysin derivatives obtained in high yields have shown potent cytotoxicity against cancer cell lines from prostate, lung, breast, cervical, and skin cancers with IC50 values in the low nM range (IC50 = 13&#8211;53&#160;nM).








Abstract
Tubulysins belong to a class of natural products originally isolated from myxobacteria culture and are known to induce cell apoptosis through inhibition of microtubule assembly. Herein, we report the computationally designed, structurally simplified, and first solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis of novel third&#8208;generation tubulin inhibitors in high yields. These inhibitors are devoid of tubuvaline and tubuphenylalanine fragments previously considered essential for tubulin inhibition activity. The most potent inhibitor contains four fragments arranged from the N terminal to the C terminal as N&#8208;methyl pipecolic acid, isoleucine, valine&#8208;thiazole, and asparagine. The hydrophilic tubulin inhibitors demonstrated significant anticancer activity, with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range (IC50 = 13&#8211;53&#160;nM) within a 48&#160;hours incubation period across prostate, lung, breast, skin, and cervical cancer cell lines. The synthetic strategy incorporates a simplified valine&#8208;thiazole ring structure, retaining both biological activity and chiral integrity of the molecules. The method enables the synthesis of potent tubulin inhibitors by avoiding multistep synthetic and purification procedures, supporting the inhibitor's applicability for large&#8208;scale synthesis and potential therapeutic development. The structural modifications at the N&#8208;terminal result in the loss of activity from nM to &#181;M range, whereas the C&#8208;terminal modification had minimal impact on the potency.

Program catalysis with light: Herein, we report a light&#8208;responsive peptide assembly system which switches between thermodynamically stable equilibrium nanofibers and energy&#8208;dependent nonequilibrium nanoparticles via SPs photoisomerization, enabling programmable control of catalytic activity in Michael addition reactions.








Abstract
The dynamic regulation of self&#8208;assembled structures in nonequilibrium states is critical for mimicking biological functions, where energy&#8208;driven processes underpin spatiotemporal control of molecular activities. Herein, we report a light&#8208;responsive peptide assembly system that switches between thermodynamically stable equilibrium nanofibers and energy&#8208;dependent nonequilibrium nanoparticles. This dual&#8208;state behavior is enabled by spiropyran's (SPs) photoisomerization, which switches between the closed&#8208;ring SP and open&#8208;ring merocyanine (MC) forms. Crucially, this morphological transition enables programmable control of catalytic activity in Michael addition reactions. In the dark&#8208;stable equilibrium state, the nanofiber formed by peptide 1 exhibited robust catalysis, achieving over 95% yield. Under blue light, the nonequilibrium nanoparticle assembly of 1 completely abolished catalytic activity. Intermittent light exposure further demonstrates programmable regulation of reaction progression.&#160;The system's ability to couple structural dynamics with functional modulation offers a new avenue for designing programmable catalysts and adaptive materials.

         <title>BN&#8208;Fused Polycyclic Heteroarenes Containing Thiopyran Moieties: Synthesis, Aromaticity, and Dual&#8208;Chromic Behavior</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 46, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
BN&#8208;fused thiopyran derivatives have been designed and successfully synthesized. Unlike the fluoride ions coordinating to the azaborine rings, the protons are introduced on the cyclopenta[b]thiopyran units. This work not only provides the first construction of BN&#8208;fused thiopyran derivatives but also develops new candidates for dual&#8208;chromic smart materials.








Abstract
BN&#8208;fused polycyclic heteroarenes have attracted extensive attention due to their distinctive structures and optoelectronic properties. However, the fusion of an azaborine ring on a six&#8208;membered thiopyran ring remains unexplored, limiting the chemical diversity and optical tunability of this unique material family. Herein, BN&#8208;embedded thiopyran derivatives with different conjugation lengths have been straightforwardly synthesized, and their photophysical properties, aromaticities, and dual&#8208;chromic behaviors have been systematically investigated. The successful incorporation of the thiopyran ring into BN&#8208;embedded heteroarenes endows the rigid molecules with a narrow optical band gap. Moreover, the BN&#8208;fused thiopyran derivatives exhibit dual&#8208;chromic behaviors in response to fluoride ions and protons. Unlike the fluoride ions coordinating to the azaborine rings, the protons are introduced on the cyclopenta[b]thiopyran moieties, as revealed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectra and theoretical calculations. Additionally, fluorination brings about the loss of aromaticity for the azaborine ring, while protonation induces the aromaticity enhancement for the thiopyran ring. Furthermore, dual&#8208;chromic pictures based on the BN&#8208;embedded thiopyran derivates are demonstrated. Overall, this work not only provides the first construction of BN&#8208;fused thiopyran derivatives but also develops new candidates for dual&#8208;chromic smart materials.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Mediated Divergent Synthesis of Sulfonylated Dihydropyrrole&#8208;3&#8208;Carboxaldehydes and Tricyclic Sulfones via Sulfonyl Radical Source Modulation</title>

Insert text for Table of Contents here. This study introduces an environmentally friendly and efficient photocatalytic approach, wherein the sulfonyl radical&#8208;induced cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes facilitates the selective synthesis of sulfonylated dihydropyrrole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxaldehydes and tricyclic benzo&#8208;fused seven&#8208;membered sulfones. The strategy's tunability arises from the sulfonyl radical source, which directs the reaction toward either radical cyclization or cascade cyclization.








Abstract
In this study, we present a green and efficient photocatalytic strategy, where sulfonyl radical&#8208;triggered cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes enables the selective formation of the sulfonylated dihydropyrrole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxaldehydes and tricyclic benzofused seven&#8208;membered sulfones. The switchable nature of the strategy relies on the selective control between radical cyclization and radical cascade cyclization, dictated by the choice of sulfonyl radical source. Under the photocatalytic conditions, selenosulfonates yielded sulfonylated heterocyclic carboxaldehydes, while sodium aryl sulfinates led to the formation of tricyclic benzo&#8208;fused seven&#8208;membered sulfones. Under blue LED irradiation, selenosulfonates generate sulfonyl and phenylselenyl radicals. The sulfonyl radical adds chemoselectively to the alkene, triggering a 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization to form a vinyl radical, which is trapped by the phenylselenyl radical. Oxygen and EY&#8208;Na&#8322; facilitate the conversion of selenosulfonylated intermediates into sulfonylated 4,5&#8208;dihydropyrrole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxaldehydes. A range of 4,5&#8208;dihydropyrrole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxaldehydes was synthesized using the developed method. Sodium aryl sulfinates, under blue LED irradiation and in the presence of 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;Hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol&#160;(HFIP)1,1&#8208;Diphenylethylene, react with 1,6&#8208;enynes to afford tricyclic benzo&#8208;fused seven&#8208;membered sulfones. Additionally, the tricyclic sulfone can be readily transformed into a unique bicyclic seven&#8208;membered sulfone bearing an exocyclic double bond. A variety of control experiments was performed, providing important mechanistic understanding of both steps in the transformation.

         <title>Layer Sliding&#8208;Induced Fluorescence Changes in a Flexible Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 46, August 18, 2025. </description>

A fluorescence color change from blue to green of pyrene&#8208;based HOFs was achieved by the sliding of the H&#8208;bonded 2D network layers. Single&#8208;crystal XRD analysis revealed that the 2D&#8208;layer sliding forms a pyrene dimer, which results in the green color of the HOF emission including the excimer contribution.








Abstract
Flexible hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) capable of changing their fluorescence properties upon structural transformation have gained much attention, while their design strategies have not been established. Herein, we demonstrate that sliding of the robust hydrogen&#8208;bonded 2D layers can induce dynamic emission color changes of HOFs. Layered HOF CP&#8208;tBPy&#8208;1, which is composed of tert&#8208;butylpyrene derivative with four carboxyphenyl groups (CP&#8208;tBPy), transformed to another crystalline form, CP&#8208;tBPy&#8208;2, upon release of guest solvent molecules. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed that the sliding of the layers changed the pyrene cores from monomeric to dimeric species, giving rise to fluorescence color changes from blue to green. Fluorescence spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystals microscopy disclosed details of the photobehaviors of these HOFs. These results are the first example of fluorescence changes of HOFs due to sliding of hydrogen&#8208;bonded 2D network layers, providing a new design strategy to construct functional fluorescent porous materials.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 46, August 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impact of hemilabile ligands in &#954;2&#8208;N,E&#8208;chelated iridium and rhodium complexes on small molecule activation has been systematically investigated (E = S or Se).

To study the role of hemilabile ligands in B&#9472;H bond activation, &#954;2&#8208;N,E&#8208;chelated iridium and rhodium complexes, [Cp*M(&#954;1&#8208;E&#8208;C5H4NE)(&#954;2&#8208;N,E&#8208;C5H4NE)] (2a: M = Ir, E = S; 2b: M = Ir, E = Se; 2c: M = Rh, E = S; 2b: M = Rh, E = Se) have been synthesized by salt metathesis reactions of [Cp*MCl2]2 (1a: M = Ir, 1a: M = Rh) and potassium salts of thio&#8208;/seleno&#8208;pyridine ligands. The strained four&#8208;membered rings in 2a&#8208;d indicate their potential for activating small molecules. Indeed, treatment of 2a&#8208;b with [BH3&#8901;THF] afforded monometallic diborane(5) complexes, [(Cp*IrIIIH){&#954;3&#8208;B,B,Se&#8208;(B2H4&#8208;C5H4NE)}] (3a: E = S, 3b: E = Se) and transition metal (TM)&#8208;dihydroborate complexes, [(&#951;4&#8208;C5Me5H)IrI{&#954;2&#8208;H,H,E&#8208;(H3B&#8208;C5H4NE))] (4a: E = S, 4b: E = Se). Complexes 3a&#8208;b, containing a [Cp*IrH] unit, stabilize the non&#8208;classical [B2H4(C5H4NE)]&#8722; fragment, presumably generated through B&#9472;H activation at the Ir&#9472;N bond and subsequent dehydrogenation. In contrast, the Rh analogues 2c&#8208;d yielded dihydroborate rhodium(I) complexes, [(&#951;4&#8208;C5Me5H)RhI{&#954;3&#8208;H,H,E&#8208;(H3B&#8208;C5H4NE)}] (4c: E = S, 4d: E = Se) through B&#9472;H bond insertion into the Rh&#9472;N bonds followed by cyclopentadienyl ring slippage. In an attempt to synthesize a rhodium analogue of 3b, complex 4d is treated with [BH3&#8901;THF] which generated an unsymmetrical bis&#8208;zwitterionic rhodium complex, [Cp*Rh(&#956;3&#8208;Se){BH2(C5H4NSe)}2], 5 comprising a bicyclo [4.4.0] cage.

         <title>Synthesis of Anthraquinone Mono&#8208; and Diboron Complexes with Near&#8208;Infrared Panchromatic Absorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anthraquinone boron complexes bearing &#946;&#8208;iminoenolate ligand(s) exhibit strongly substituent&#8208;dependent absorption properties. Unsubstituted monoboron and diboron complexes show sharp UV&#8211;Vis&#8211;NIR absorption spectra resulting from increased molecular rigidity induced by boron coordination. In contrast, dimethylamino&#8208;substituted complexes display near&#8208;infrared (NIR) panchromatic absorption, attributed to enhanced intramolecular charge transfer and multiple electronic transitions.








Abstract
Anthraquinone monoboron complexes 3 and 4, possessing a donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) structure, and diboron complexes 7 and 8, featuring a donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor (D&#8211;A&#8211;D) structure, were readily synthesized in two steps from commercially available reagents. These boron complexes adopt a &#946;&#8208;iminoenolate structure and their absorption properties are markedly affected by the type of the substituent groups. The unsubstituted monoboron complex 3 (fwhm&#160;=&#160;3,950 cm&#8722;1) and diboron complex 7 (fwhm&#160;=&#160;2,510 cm&#8722;1) exhibited sharp UV&#8211;Vis&#8211;NIR absorption spectra, which can be attributed to increased molecular rigidity induced by boron coordination. In contrast, the dimethylamino&#8208;substituted monoboron complex 4 (fwhm&#160;=&#160;7,580 cm&#8722;1) and diboron complex 8 (fwhm&#160;=&#160;8,770 cm&#8722;1) showed broad absorption bands due to the enhanced intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (ICT) character. Dimethylamino&#8208;substituted monoboron complex 4 and diboron complex 8 exhibited panchromatic absorption ranging from 400&#160;nm to 1,000&#160;nm and 400&#160;nm to 1,250&#160;nm, respectively. The panchromatic absorption of the dimethylamino&#8208;substituted boron complexes 4 and 8 is attributed not only to the enhanced ICT character but also to the combination of multiple transitions.

Abstract
We herein disclose a dual synthetic approach involving sonochemical and mechanochemical strategies for a diverse series of cyanomethyl esters of carboxylic acids. Both synthetic protocols offer a straightforward, efficient, and practical alternative to preparing this important class of biologically and synthetically promising organic compounds. Significant advantages of the newly developed methods include mild reaction conditions, avoidance of any metal catalysts and external oxidants, shorter reaction times (in minutes), good to excellent yields, broad substrate scope and tolerance of other various functional groups, gram&#8208;scale applicability, and reusability of the solid surface.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Induced Stabilization and Folding Pathways of &#945;&#8208;Helical Peptides: A Computational Investigation Using Steered Molecular Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study employed molecular simulations to investigate the stabilization of &#945;&#8208;helical structures in HFIP compared to aqueous environments. SMD simulations demonstrated the stretching polypeptide chains to effectively preserve &#945;&#8208;helical conformations and enhance structural stability through solvation effects.








Abstract
Fluorinated polar solvents, such as hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (HFIP), are known to denature proteins into &#945;&#8208;helix&#8208;rich structures, a phenomenon of interest in protein engineering and fiber science. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations offer a valuable approach to explore protein folding mechanisms. In the present study, steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations were conducted to stretch the polypeptide models along the &#945;&#8208;helix axis in different solvents. The potential of mean force (PMF) associated with nonequilibrium stretching of the polypeptide chain was higher in HFIP than in water and varied depending on amino acid composition and degree of polymerization. HFIP molecules preferentially concentrated in grooves of &#945;&#8208;helical polypeptides. Stretching the polypeptides in HFIP resulted in the formation of 310&#8208;helix structures, suggesting that local solvation enhances structural stability. Additional SMD simulations of Trp&#8208;cage, a mini&#8208;protein driven by hydrophobic collapse in protein folding, showed partial unfolding of the &#945;&#8208;helix region and global extension of both termini. The resulting PMF profiles indicate that &#945;&#8208;helices are formed in the early stages of Trp&#8208;cage folding. This study offers an analytical framework that can be extended to more complex amino acid sequences and proteins with diverse structural motifs. HFIP appears to play a central role in the &#945;&#8208;helical transformation of higher&#8208;order protein structures.

         <title>Phytic Acid Assisted Preparation of Cu3P/Cu@C Composites as High Performance Anodes for Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyaniline was polymerized and deposited on the surface of Cu nanowire@carbon (C) nanocore&#8208;shells, and utilizing phytic acid as phosphorus source, a unique Cu3P/Cu@C composite spherical structure with with N,P&#8208;codoped graphitic carbon nanotubes entwined has been fabricated through a simple high&#8208;temperature annealing. Such porous and doped Cu3P&#8208;carbon anodes show excellent rate capability with ultra&#8208;long service life at current density up to 2000 mA/g.








Abstract
Phosphorus&#8208;based anodes show new perspectives in high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;ion batteries, but harsh synthesis and severe capacity attenuation seriously preclude their practical application. Here, Cu nanowire@carbon (C) nanocore&#8208;shells are designed to utilize as sacrificial templates for polyaniline loading, and with the assistance of phytic acid (PA), a novel Cu3P/Cu@C microsphere composite structure is successfully constructed via direct thermal annealing, in which heteroatom&#8208;doped graphitic carbon nanotubes are wounded with each other and firmly entangled on spheres. The polyaniline polymerization by (NH4)2S2O8 and the addition of PA are indispensable for the unique Cu3P sphere formation. Both the spherical Cu3P structure and its doped carbon encapsulating could largely alleviate volume expansion during lithium storage, while the intertwined carbon nanotubes provide fast transport channels for Li+. Therefore, as anode, it exhibits relatively stable cyclic performance, and after 10,000 cycles at an ultra&#8208;high rate of 2000 mA/g, it still maintain a capacity of 278.57 mAh/g with capacity retention of 73.12%. Through analysis, large specific surface area and multi&#8208;level pore distribution of the optimized Cu3P&#8208;carbon anode, and the extended interlayer spacing of doped carbon are conducive to the reversible intercalation and adsorption of Li+. Electrochemical mechanism analysis also confirms its dramatic surface pseudo&#8208;capacitance contribution and excellent reaction kinetics.

         <title>A 19F&#8208;ATCUN Peptide NMR Probe for Selective Cu2+ or Ni2+ Sensing in Complex Biological Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the design and synthesis of ratiometric 19F&#8208;ATCUN (Xxx&#8208;Zzz&#8208;His) peptide probes for the selective and reversible detection of Ni2&#8314; and Cu2&#8314; by 19F NMR spectroscopy. In contrast to fluorescence&#8208;based approaches, 19F NMR enables background&#8208;free detection in biological media, due to the absence of fluorine in native biomolecules. The probes remain stable and functional in complex cell media (DMEM), enabling the detection of Cu2&#8314; and Ni2&#8314; by 19F NMR with a limit of detection (LOD) of 4&#160;&#181;M and quantification (LOQ) of 10&#160;&#181;M, relevant for studying copper&#8208;related pathologies.

         <title>Mechanochemical Preferential Bromination at the &#945;&#8208;Position of Activated Naphthalenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study focuses on the mechanochemical pathway for &#945;&#8208;bromination of &#946;&#8208;functionalized naphthalenes. This uses N&#8208;bromosuccinimide as a mild brominating precursor and highlights the tolerance and limitations of functional groups used. This applies on gram scale synthesis and production of various useful intermediates.








Abstract
This study is the exploration of a solvent&#8208;free, mechanochemically enabled sustainable pathway for rapid and preferential selective &#945;&#8208;bromination of &#946;&#8208;functionalized naphthalenes using N&#8208;bromosuccinimide. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis and diverse post&#8208;functionalizations demonstrate the versatility of the &#945;&#8208;brominated &#946;&#8208;functionalized naphthalenes in organic synthesis, pharmaceuticals, materials, and catalysis. This green and environment&#8208;benign approach, having E&#8208;factor of 0.5, offers high yields up to 98% within 30 minutes and highlights broad functional electron&#8208;donating groups (EDGs) along with limitations of electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (EWGs).

         <title>Photoswitchable Merocyanine&#8208;Amphiphiles with Programmable Self&#8208;Assembly Times</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A merocyanine&#8208;based amphiphile self&#8208;assembles in water to form visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive ellipsoids that can be disassembled with visible light and reform abruptly &#8764;70&#160;minutes after the light is switched off. The kinetics of the light&#8208;induced assembly/disassembly process is controllable by incorporating different co&#8208;surfactants.








Abstract
A merocyanine&#8208;based amphiphile was self&#8208;assembled into ellipsoids that can be disassembled by irradiation with visible light and reassemble in the dark after a delay of &#8764;70&#160;minutes. Above a threshold concentration, the reassembly occurs when the ratio of protonated merocyanine to spiropyran reaches 7:3, suggesting both isomers are involved in the assembly. The thermal isomerization of the amphiphile when assembled (half&#8208;life &#8764;13&#160;minutes) is significantly slower than that in dilute solution (half&#8208;life &#8764;3.6&#160;minutes). The self&#8208;assembly behavior was confirmed by UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), small&#8208;angle neutron scattering (SANS) and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS). The delay between the isomerization and the assembly processes can be tuned between minutes and hours by adding differently charged co&#8208;surfactants.

         <title>Cyanostilbenes as Selective Chloride Carriers Relying on CH&#8208;anion Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This manuscript presents a series of eight small compounds based on the &#945;&#8208;cyanostilbene motif and with different substituents. Three of these compounds show good rates of chloride transport, as well as selectivity for chloride over hydroxide, bicarbonate, and fluoride anions.








Abstract
Achieving selectivity is one of the challenges in developing anion receptors for transmembrane transport. This can be achieved through larger molecular designs that encapsulate the anion efficiently or by using alternative binding motifs instead of the most commonly used NH&#8208;based hydrogen bond donors. In this study, we present a series of small chloride receptors based on &#945;&#8208;cyanostilbenes that use CH&#8208;based hydrogen bonds. By varying the substituents, we discovered that the compound containing four trifluoromethyl groups and a nitro group in addition to the two cyano groups exhibited the greatest affinity for chloride and the fastest chloride transport rates, surpassing the performance of reported triazole&#8208;based compound. Furthermore, this compound showed clear selectivity for transporting chloride over hydroxide, bicarbonate, and fluoride anions. The activity, selectivity, and deliverability of this compound make it a promising candidate for the treatment of chloride channelopathies.

This can be achieved through larger molecular designs that encapsulate the anion efficiently or by using alternative binding motifs instead of the most commonly used NH-based hydrogen bond donors. In this study, we present a series of small chloride receptors based on &#945;-cyanostilbenes that use CH-based hydrogen bonds. By varying the substituents, we discovered that the compound containing four trifluoromethyl groups and a nitro group in addition to the two cyano groups exhibited the greatest affinity for chloride and the fastest chloride transport rates, surpassing the performance of reported triazole-based compound. Furthermore, this compound showed clear selectivity for transporting chloride over hydroxide, bicarbonate, and fluoride anions. The activity, selectivity, and deliverability of this compound make it a promising candidate for the treatment of chloride channelopathies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Navigating Scholl&#8208;Type Oxidative Coupling: An Electronic Programming Toward Path Revelation, Selectivity, and Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aryl substituents navigate the course of Scholl&#8208;type oxidative coupling in tetraarylthiophenes, enabling selective mono&#8208; versus dual cyclizations via electronic step discrimination and control. Guided by Hammett &#963;p constants, this study deciphers reactivity trends, face selectivity, excellent control, and coupling pathways&#8212;offering a predictive blueprint for regioselective &#960;&#8208;architecture construction.








Abstract
Scholl&#8208;type oxidative aryl&#8208;aryl coupling is a powerful strategy for constructing extended &#960;&#8208;systems, yet achieving regioselectivity and stepwise control remains a formidable challenge. Here, we report a systematic study on tetraarylthiophene (TAT) frameworks, revealing how subtle electronic effects of aryl substituents govern C&#9472;C bond formation efficiency, selectivity, and pathways. Guided by electrochemical potentials and Hammett &#963;p constants, we establish a reactivity trend&#8212;OMe&#160;&gt;&#160;Me&#160;&gt;&#160;tBu&#160;&gt;&#160;H&#160;&gt;&#160;Ph&#160;&gt;&#160;F&#160;&gt;&#160;Cl&#160;&gt;&#160;CHO&#160;&gt;&#160;CF3&#8212;revealing that electron&#8208;rich aryls promote efficient coupling, while electron&#8208;deficient groups suppress reactivity. Crucially, face&#8208;selective mono&#8208;cyclization products (PTs) are achieved by electronic step discrimination, where strategically pairing electronically distinct aryls steers homo&#8208; versus cross&#8208;coupling outcomes, enabling precise control over sequential couplings. Our findings unveil a simple yet powerful electronic map to predict coupling outcomes, product evolution, and opens a rational path to design regioselective oxidative cyclizations in polyaryl architectures toward precise &#960;&#8208;frameworks.

Indeno[2.1&#8208;b]fluorenes and fluoreno[2,3&#8208;b]fluorenes having (trialkylsilyl)ethynyl groups dimerize spontaneously to yield the cyclodimers in the yields ranging from virtually zero to quantitative depending on the alkyl group. The regioselectivity of the bond formation (Head versus Tail) is also dependent on the alkyl group. These remarkable effects are attributed to the attractive London dispersion force between the &#960;&#8208; system and the alkyl groups.








Abstract
We present herein a systematic study on the cyclodimerization of (trialkylsilyl)ethynyl&#8208;substituted derivatives of indeno[2.1&#8208;b]fluorene and fluoreno[2,3&#8208;b]fluorene, which incorporate an open&#8208;shell meta&#8208;quinodimethane (m&#8208;QDM) unit. Our investigation focuses on the influence of different alkyl groups (methyl, isopropyl, or cyclohexyl) attached to the silyl moiety. Upon generation from the precursor diols via treatment with SnCl2, these m&#8208;QDM derivatives yielded cyclodimers with an anti&#8208;configuration. The reaction yields varied significantly, ranging from virtually zero to quantitative, depending on the steric bulk of the alkyl group. Furthermore, the regioselectivity of bond formation (Head versus Tail) with respect to the ethynyl&#8211;allenyl radical resonance forms was also notably affected by the choice of alkyl group. These remarkable observations are attributed to attractive London dispersion forces operating between the &#960;&#8208;system and the alkyl groups. Crucially, the degree of size matching between these components dictates both the dimerization efficiency and the regioselectivity of the bond&#8208;forming process.

         <title>Coacervate Vesicles as Adaptive Platforms for Synthetic Biology and Smart Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coacervate vesicles are emerging protocells that merge coacervates&#8217; functionality within membranised architectures. Their diverse formation mechanisms from coacervate droplets yield tunable, responsive systems with broad potential, from synthetic biology to smart materials, offering a powerful, programmable platform for next&#8208;generation bioinspired technologies.








Abstract
Coacervate vesicles represent a versatile and emerging class of protocells that combine the dynamic properties of coacervate microdroplets with the structural advantages of membrane&#8208;bound systems. Leveraging features such as selective molecular uptake, enhanced reactivity, and dynamicity, they offer a promising platform for both fundamental research and technological applications in synthetic biology. In this concept, we introduce a classification of coacervate vesicles based on their formation mechanisms and energetic landscapes, highlighting how their formation routes give rise to protocells with distinct structural and dynamic properties. Furthermore, we explore how these features translate into potential applications, including artificial life&#8208;like systems, complex communication networks, adaptive soft materials, and smart drug&#8208;delivery platforms. While the field is still in its infancy, the simplicity, versatility, and programmability of coacervate vesicles position them as a powerful framework for engineering next&#8208;generation synthetic life&#8208;like systems.

Abstract
The first stable 1&#8208;stannavinylidene&#8208;NHC complex with bulky silyl substituents has been obtained from the retro&#8208;dimerization of cyclic 1,3&#8208;bis(stannylene) with an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC). To accomplish the retro&#8208;dimerization of cyclic 1,3&#8208;bis(stannylene), a suitably sized NHC is required. Both in the solid state and in solution, 1&#8208;stannavinylidene&#8208;NHC complex is characterized by the presence of a C&#160;=&#160;Sn &#960; bond. When treated with SnCl2, 1&#8208;stannavinylidene&#8208;NHC complex undergoes an addition reaction to afford the corresponding stable gem&#8208;bis(chlorostannylene).

         <title>5d Orbital Covalency Controls the High&#8208;Pressure Polymorphism of BaO</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Barium oxide forms unique structures under pressure because of Ba&#8212;O bonding through the 5d orbitals. DFT bonding analysis shows that these bonds outweigh electrostatic interactions in BaO, but not CaO or SrO.








Abstract
The influence of metal d orbitals on the high&#8208;pressure structures of CaO, SrO, and BaO are investigated with DFT calculations and chemical bonding analysis. CaO and SrO undergo the B1&#8208;B2 transition, from the rock salt structure to the caesium chloride structure, while BaO undergoes a sequence of transitions from B1&#8208;B8, the NiAs structure, and then B8 &#8722; dB2, a distorted form of B2. DFT calculations of bond strengths show that the B8 and dB2 structures are stabilized relative to B1 and B2 by metal&#8211;oxygen covalency through the metal d orbitals. In BaO covalency outweighs electrostatics because of the large 5d orbitals of Ba, so the unique B8 and dB2 structures form.

&lt;p&gt;Barium oxide forms unique structures under pressure because of Ba&#8212;O bonding through the 5&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; orbitals. DFT bonding analysis shows that these bonds outweigh electrostatic interactions in BaO, but not CaO or SrO.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The influence of metal &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; orbitals on the high-pressure structures of CaO, SrO, and BaO are investigated with DFT calculations and chemical bonding analysis. CaO and SrO undergo the &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;1-&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;2 transition, from the rock salt structure to the caesium chloride structure, while BaO undergoes a sequence of transitions from &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;1-&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;8, the NiAs structure, and then &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;8 &#8722; &lt;i&gt;dB&lt;/i&gt;2, a distorted form of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;2. DFT calculations of bond strengths show that the &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;8 and &lt;i&gt;dB&lt;/i&gt;2 structures are stabilized relative to &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;1 and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;2 by metal&#8211;oxygen covalency through the metal &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; orbitals. In BaO covalency outweighs electrostatics because of the large 5&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; orbitals of Ba, so the unique &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;8 and &lt;i&gt;dB&lt;/i&gt;2 structures form. This marks an important expansion of the importance of &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; orbitals in group II&#160;chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aromatic Wall Extension of Glycoluril&#8208;Derived Molecular Clips Enhances Binding of Planar Aromatic Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of the length of the aromatic walls of methylene&#8208;bridged glycoluril&#8208;dimer&#8208;derived molecular clips on their binding affinity toward a panel of planar aromatic cations is reported. We find that anthracene&#8208;walled host H2 generally binds&#160;&#8776;&#160;10&#8208;fold stronger to a specific guest than naphthalene&#8208;walled H1.








Abstract
We report the synthesis and characterization of a new methylene&#8208;bridged glycoluril dimer featuring anthracene walls (H2). H2 displays good solubility in water (&#8805;7&#160;mM) but undergoes self&#8208;association at concentrations above 2&#160;mM. 1H NMR experiments establish that H2 binds cationic dyes inside its cavity with a &#960;&#8208;stacked geometry that places the cationic residues at the ureidyl carbonyl portals of H2. The binding constants of both naphthalene&#8208;walled clip H1 and anthracene&#8208;walled clip H2 toward a panel of dyes were measured by direct or competitive UV/Vis or fluorescence titrations in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Binding constants cover the range from 103 &#8211; 108 M&#8722;1. Dyes that feature cationic NMe2 groups bind more strongly than analogous dyes with cationic NH2 groups. We find that &#960;&#8208;extension of the aromatic walls from H1 to H2 generally results in an&#160;&#8776;&#160;10&#8208;fold increase in binding affinity. Host&#8226;guest complexes of H1 and H2 with planar cationic dyes benefit from substantial cation&#8208;&#960; interactions.

         <title>3&#8242;&#8208;C&#8208;Extended TNA: De Novo Synthesis, Enhanced Exonuclease Resistance, and Functional siRNA 3&#8242;&#8208;Overhang Modifications Without Compromising Gene Silencing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed and synthesized 3&#8242;&#8208;C&#8208;extended TNA analogs (ApioNA and BpioNA) through asymmetric aldol synthesis. These analogs, modified at the 3&#8242;&#8208;terminal of oligonucleotides, display significant exonuclease resistance, particularly BpioNA, which has a 60&#8208;fold increase in half&#8208;life compared to dT. Furthermore, both analogs maintain full gene&#8208;silencing efficacy when integrated into the 3&#8242;&#8208;overhang positions of siRNA, highlighting their potential in nucleic acid therapeutics.








Abstract
The 3&#8242;&#8208;overhang of siRNAs is crucial for RISC assembly and stability, yet it is susceptible to nuclease degradation, significantly limiting its therapeutic applications. To address this challenge, we developed 3&#8242;&#8208;C&#8208;extended threose nucleic acid (TNA) analogs (ApioNA and BpioNA) using an asymmetric aldol synthesis strategy. Our results demonstrate that the BpioNA modification provides exceptional nuclease resistance, exhibiting a 60&#8208;fold increase in half&#8208;life compared to dT, while maintaining full gene silencing activity. Structural modeling revealed that these novel analogs preserve critical interactions with the Ago2 PAZ domain through adaptive binding geometries. This work not only addresses the stability&#8208;activity trade&#8208;off in siRNA design but also provides fundamental insights into the structure&#8208;activity relationships (SARs) at the 3&#8242;&#8208;terminus, paving the way for the development of durable RNAi therapeutics.

         <title>In Situ Electrochemical Synthesis of Redox&#8208;Active o&#8208;Hydroquinone Metabolite of Flufenamic Acid on MWCNT Surface: Lifespan Extension in C. elegans via SOD Pathway</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents an electrochemical strategy to generate the redox&#8208;active flufenamic acid&#8208;drug metabolite, FFA&#8208;Redox, which extends the lifespan of C. elegans worm&#8208;by up to 80% under pathogenic infection. The metabolite reduces intracellular ROS levels and enhances superoxide dismutase expression, suggesting a potent antioxidant&#8208;driven &#8220;de&#8208;aging&#8221; mechanism with promising biomedical potential.








Abstract
The search for drugs that extend lifespan in human&#8208;like biological models is a frontier area in biomedical research. In this study, we report a novel electrochemical approach using flufenamic acid (FFA), a widely known nonsteroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug (NSAID), to generate and detect its pharmacologically active metabolites. Electrochemical oxidation of FFA on multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes(MWCNT)&#8208;modified electrode yielded hydroxylated derivatives, primarily 4&#8208;hydroxy FFA (m/z 297.05&#160;g/mol) and a polyhydroxylated product termed FFA&#8208;Redox (m/z 243.05&#160;g/mol), as surface&#8208;confined species (MWCNT@FFA&#8208;Redox). To establish biological relevance, Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) were exposed to FFA, resulting in in vivo formation of metabolites identical to those generated electrochemically. This confirmed the physiological significance of the electrosynthesized compounds. Lifespan assays demonstrated that FFA&#8208;Redox prolonged the survival of C. elegans by up to 40% under Klebsiella pneumoniae infection and by up to 80% under Staphylococcus aureus infection. This protective effect was attributed to reduced levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mechanistic insights suggest that FFA&#8208;Redox induces a &#8220;de&#8208;aging&#8221; response by enhancing the expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD), a key antioxidant enzyme activated during oxidative stress.

         <title>Halogen Bond&#8208;Tuning of Responsive Supramolecular Amino Acid Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
XB strongly influences both solid&#8208;state packing and rheological properties of hydrogels of a tailored halogenated Fmoc&#8208;amino acid in biomimetic environments. Interestingly, the addition of effective XB&#8208;acceptors (Nu) to the gelation medium increased gel stiffness, preluding to the possible future development of XB&#8208;responsive amino acid hydrogels in anion sensing, or for the encapsulation of specific guest molecules.








Abstract
N&#8208;Fmoc&#8208;pentafluoro&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine (F5) forms stable supramolecular hydrogels, mainly through &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking of its aromatic groups. Hydrogen bonding&#8208;driven co&#8208;assembly of F5 with suitable partner molecules has been reported to affect the gel's properties, in accordance with what is observed in their corresponding co&#8208;crystal structures. Herein, we extended this hydrogel modulation strategy to halogen bonding (XB) interactions by introducing an XB&#8208;donating iodine atom in the para&#8208;position of the F5 phenyl ring. Under conditions mimicking biological environments, both crystal packing and hydrogelation of the resulting N&#8208;Fmoc&#8208;4&#8208;iodo&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;phenylalanine (IF4), were significantly affected by iodine&#8208;&#960; interactions. Slower fibril formation kinetics and reduced strength of IF4 hydrogels in phosphate buffer solution, compared to F5, mirrored iodine&#8208;induced changes in Fmoc stacking in the solid state. Notably, the addition of strong XB&#8208;acceptors &#8211; such as iodide anions or pyridine&#8208;containing substrates, like vitamin B3 &#8211; induced a significant increase in gel stiffness. These findings suggest the possibility of exploiting properly tailored Fmoc&#8208;amino acids as &#8220;XB&#8208;responsive&#8221; hydrogelators, useful for anion sensing applications or for trapping bioactive molecules.

Notably, the addition of strong XB-acceptors &#8211; such as iodide anions or pyridine-containing substrates, like vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &#8211; induced a significant increase in gel stiffness. These findings suggest the possibility of exploiting properly tailored Fmoc-amino acids as &#8220;XB-responsive&#8221; hydrogelators, useful for anion sensing applications or for trapping bioactive molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mild and Selective Trifluoromethylation of Peptides at Tryptophane Residues by a Water&#8208;Soluble Copper Complex with Redox&#8208;Active Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective functionalization of aminoacids is a key endeavor in chemical biology. Radical manifolds offer interesting possibilities but can suffer from limited control over radical processes, resulting in a lack of selectivity in product distribution. A water&#8208;soluble copper complex with redox&#8208;active ligands has been developed and performs trifluoromethylation of tryptophane residues with high selectivity. This method displays both inter&#8208; and intramolecular selectivity and its synthetic relevance is demonstrated by the selective conversion of a 13&#8208;residue peptidic sequence and an endomorphine analogue in good yields.








Abstract
Selective chemical modifications of biomolecules are in high demand for the development and implementation of chemical biology strategies. Methods involving radicals have emerged as powerful options yet potentially generate side reactivities when involving harsh reaction conditions. We report the development of a mild catalytic method for the selective functionalization of tryptophane residues in peptides with a trifluoromethyl group using a water&#8208;soluble copper complex with redox&#8208;active ligands. This method displays both inter&#8208; and intramolecular selectivity for tryptophane residues and its synthetic relevance is demonstrated by the selective conversion of a 13&#8208;residue peptidic sequence and an endomorphine analogue in good yields.

         <title>Copper&#8208;catalyzed Chemoselective Reduction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated Flavone Olefin and It's Glycosides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a chemoselective copper&#8208;catalyzed reduction of flavones to flavanones using ammonia borane as a hydrogen source. Copper (II) catalyst in combination with a bipyridine ligand enabled selective hydrogenation of the C&#9552;C bond in the enone system, whereas Cu(I) without a ligand facilitated dual reduction of both the olefinic and carbonyl groups, yielding flavanols under similar conditions. NMR studies revealed that the reaction proceeds through the in situ generation of CuH in the reaction medium as the active reducing agent.








Abstract
The chemoselective reduction of flavones to flavanones remains a significant synthetic challenge in the total synthesis of bioactive flavonoid glycosides. This chemoselective reduction of flavone olefin requires precise control over reactivity to reduce the conjugated &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl system without affecting the functional groups commonly present in the complex carbohydrate derivatives. We report a straightforward copper&#8208;catalyzed reduction method using ammonia borane (NH3&#8226;BH3) as a hydrogen source. The catalytic system, based on a Cu(II) combination with bipyridine ligand, exhibited highly chemoselective hydrogenation of the C&#9552;C bond in the enone moiety of flavones to flavanones, whereas the Cu(I) without ligand reduced both functional groups to furnish flavanols. Notably, this methodology demonstrated a broad substrate scope with a wide range of functional group tolerance, including various sugar&#8208;derived substituents. The synthetic utility and versatility of the protocol were further highlighted through the useful synthesis of a library of mono&#8208; and disaccharide&#8208;conjugated flavonoid glycosides. Interestingly, this catalytic system displayed distinct reactivity by efficiently reducing carbonyl compounds to alcohols while inhibiting over&#8208;reduction to alkanes. Additionally, we performed a series of control experiments to gain a deeper insight into the mechanism and revealed that the reaction proceeds through the in situ generation of CuH in the reaction.

         <title>Soluble Ring&#8208;Unsubstituted Phthalocyanine Zirconium(IV) and Niobium(V) cis&#8208;Alkoxides and Their Catalytic Activity Toward the Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of rac&#8208;Lactide</title>

         <dc:description>
Ring&#8208;unsubstituted phthalocyanine chloride complexes of Zr(IV) and Nb(V) are solubilized via conversion to a range of cis&#8208;axially ligated alkoxides, which show varying levels of activity as lactide polymerization catalysts depending on the alkoxide and the metal center.








Abstract
A series of soluble ring&#8208;unsubstituted early&#8208;transition metallophthalocyanine (PcM) alkoxides with zirconium(IV) and niobium(V) metal centers was prepared via salt metathesis with PcM chlorides and a range of lithium or sodium alkoxides (NaOMe, NaOEt, LiOiPr, and NaOtBu); several examples were structurally characterized. Given their large ionic size, the metal centers protrude out of the Pc cavity, engendering cis&#8208;axial ligation of the alkoxides and thereby generating substantially improved solubility relative to the starting PcM chlorides. Seven&#8208;coordinate PcM(OR)3&#8208;type coordination spheres were typically observed, with lithium&#8208; or sodium&#8208;balanced &#8220;ate&#8221; species PcZr(OiPr)3Li(THF) and PcZr(OtBu)3Na(THF) isolated for PcZr(IV), compared to the neutral PcNb(OiPr)3. With the highly steric R&#160;=&#160;tBu the neutral six&#8208;coordinate PcZr(OtBu)2 was also structurally characterized. The catalytic activity of the PcZr(IV) and PcNb(V) alkoxides was probed toward the ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of rac&#8208;lactide, with PcZr(OiPr)3Li(THF) being the most active, while the PcNb(V) systems were either inactive or yielded oligomers.

         <title>The Ability of Enzymes to Preserve Reactive Conformations During Enzyme&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions can be an Important Factor for Efficient Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymes may not only generate catalytic competent conformations for enzyme&#8208;substrate complexes but also be able to preserve the reactive conformations to the stage when the reactions reach TS to allow catalytic residues to exert their effects. Such property could be lost for some mutants, leading to diminished TS stabilization and significant reduction of catalytic efficiency. Blue: enzyme; Yellow: substrate; Orange: the altered structure of substrate in TS.








Abstract
Determining strategies used by enzymes to achieve enormous rate enhancements has been a central goal in biochemical research. The abilities to form catalytic competent reactive conformations for enzyme&#8208;substrate complexes with well&#8208;positioned residues and to lower activation barriers through transition state (TS) stabilization are two accepted mechanisms. Enzymes might have evolved to possess other unrecognized strategies to achieve rate enhancements, and identification of such strategies is of fundamental importance. Here we perform a quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical study of carnosine N&#8208;methyltransferase 1 and its mutants, and results indicate that enzymes may possess the ability to preserve reactive conformations and prevent their premature distortions into less active forms during reactions. For wild&#8208;type, the reactive conformation can be formed in the enzyme&#8208;substrate complex and be preserved to the stage when the reaction reaches TS. For Tyr386Ala, Tyr396Asp, and Tyr398Ala, the wild&#8208;type&#8208;like reactive conformations can be formed in the mutant&#8208;substrate complexes but undergo distortions into less active conformations in the early stage of the reaction before TS. Such premature distortions of the wild&#8208;type&#8208;like reactive conformations in the mutant complexes prevent residues from fully exerting catalytic effects. Thus, the ability to preserve reactive conformations may be an important feature for some enzymes and can make important contributions to catalytic efficiency.

The presented formalism gives insight into the strength and sign of the coupling based on the relative arrangement of the lobes of the transition density explaining oscillations between H&#8208; and J&#8208;aggregate behavior observed when two molecules are displaced relative to each other.








Abstract
Aggregation effects of molecular chromophores play a crucial role in determining the spectroscopic properties of solid&#8208;state organic materials. Within this work, we focus on excitonic coupling and particularly the question of whether aggregation leads to H&#8208; or J&#8208;type coupling, that is, whether the lowest energy excited state of the aggregate is optically bright or not. Employing a supermolecular picture to represent the different terms giving rise to exciton splitting, we develop an intuitive and generally applicable phenomenological model for estimating the sign and magnitude of the exciton coupling. This model, which is based on the shape of the monomer transition density is shown to be suitable across the whole range of relevant wave function types from purely Coulomb&#8208;coupled Frenkel excitons to strongly charge&#8208;transfer admixed excimer states. The implications are illustrated in the stacked anthracene and perylene&#8208;diimide dimer systems. The presented model does not only explain the long&#8208;range behavior but provides a clear explanation of atom&#8208;scale oscillations in the couplings seen for these systems. We hope that this work will give a boost to modern molecular materials science by providing new insight into interactions in the solid state as well as by highlighting the power of going beyond a simple frontier orbital picture in the design of molecular&#160;materials.

         <title>A Mechanistic Insight into the Emission Behavior of Boron Difluorohydrazones (BODIHYs): Suppression of Kasha's Rule</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anti&#8208;Kasha property of phenanthrene&#8208;based BODIHY compounds leads to excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent RGB emissions. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that both molecules emit from three different excited states, namely S1, S2, and S3. Importantly, the phenyl&#8208;substituted BODIHY exhibits thermal equilibrium between S1 and S2, while S3 does not.








Abstract
Single component&#8208;based molecules and materials exhibiting excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent emission are of significant interest in both academic and industrial contexts. Luminophores capable of emitting multiple colors in response to different excitation wavelengths often deviate from Kasha's rule. The boron difluorohydrazone (BODIHY) derivatives reported herein exhibit excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent emissions, illuminating red, green, and blue (RGB) colors. Experimental and theoretical studies indicate that this multi&#8208;color luminescence originates from three bright excited states, namely, S1, S2, and S3. Such anomalous fluorescence in small organic molecules that possess three bright excited states and emit RGB as a function of excitation wavelength is unique and unprecedented. Time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations indicate that the energy gap (&#916;E) between S2 and S3 exceeds 3000 cm&#8722;1 (0.37&#160;eV), facilitating radiative decay S3&#8594;S0 over the competitive nonradiative decay. For compound 1, the &#916;E(S1&#8211;S2) was found to be&#160;&lt;&#160;2000 cm&#8722;1 (0.25&#160;eV), leading to thermal equilibrium between the two states. In contrast, compound 2 possesses three distinct excited states that fluoresce independently due to large energy gaps between them. Furthermore, different excitation spectra, fluorescence lifetimes, and photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) for these emission bands indeed support the presence of three bright excited electronic states.

         <title>Quantum&#8208;Dots Light&#8208;Emitting Devices Based on Exciton Harvesting Layers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review introduces the concept and development of exciton harvesting layer (EHL) in quantum&#8208;dots light&#8208;emitting devices (QLEDs) as a targeted strategy to address carrier imbalance. We conclude its applicability from the QLEDs' working mechanisms, discuss the energy transfer mechanisms underlying EHL and its design principles, and highlights the significant performance improvements achieved in QLEDs.








Abstract
Quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) have emerged as a promising technology for display and lighting applications due to their high color purity, tunable emission wavelengths, and solution processability. However, carrier imbalance arising from differences in injection barriers and mobilities between electrons and holes remains a significant challenge, leading to charge accumulation or leakage and resulting in performance losses. To address these issues, exciton harvesting layers (EHLs) have recently gained attention as an effective and targeted strategy. This review presents a comprehensive overview of the EHL concept and its development in QLEDs. We begin by introducing the fundamental properties of quantum dots (QDs) and the working principles of QLEDs, followed by a discussion of the applicability of the EHL strategy. We then detail the mechanisms of energy transfer within EHL and between EHL and QDs, as well as its optimization approaches. Subsequently, we summarize the application of EHLs in QLEDs and the corresponding improvements in device performance. Finally, we highlight current challenges and future research directions of the EHL strategy.

         <title>Experimental Discovery and Electronic Structure of Free State Aminopentazole N5NH2 and its Cation</title>

N3&#8722;, N5+, cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722;, etc. are crucial all&#8208;nitrogen blocks for ANC. The free state N5NH2 and its cation N5NH3+ were synthesized via radical amination of cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722; and directional hydrolysis of imido&#8208;pentazoles N5N&#160;=&#160;CHN(Me)2.








Abstract
All&#8208;nitrogen compounds (ANC) that are environment&#8208;friendly and promising high&#8208;energy&#8208;density materials (HEDMs). N5NH2, an all&#8208;nitrogen building block with functional groups, can be converted into bridged&#8208;pentazole N10, azopentazole N12, etc. But N5NH2 synthesized by previous methods was bound in supramolecular frameworks and not isolated for further research. In this article, we synthesized free&#8208;state N5NH2 through radical amination of cyclo&#8208;N5&#8210; and its cation N5NH3+ by the directional hydrolysis of imido&#8208;pentazoles. The new structures were verified by MS, IR, NMR and powder diffraction, and their aromaticity, HOMO&#8208;LUMO, ESP, etc. were calculated by DFT. Experimental results show these compounds are only stable at low temperature. For instance, N5NH3+Cl&#8210; is stable below &#8210;20 &#176;C for 12&#160;hours. Harmonic oscillator model of aromaticity (HOMA), electron localization function (ELF), NICSZZ(1)&#960;, localized orbital locator (LOL), and anisotropy of the induced current density (ACID) show N5NH2 and N5NH3+ have aromaticity, and the order of aromaticity and stability is N5NH3+ &lt; N5NH2&#160;&lt;&#160;cyclo&#8208;N5&#8210;, consistent with experiments. The HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gaps of N5NH2 (&#916;E&#160;=&#160;10.05&#160;eV) and N5NH3+ (&#916;E&#160;=&#160;10.14&#160;eV) is lower than that of cyclo&#8208;N5&#8210; (&#916;E&#160;=&#160;11.46&#160;eV), indicating higher reaction activity. The synthesis of free&#8208;state N5NH2 is a crucial step in all&#8208;nitrogen construction and promotes the energetic materials field toward all&#8208;nitrogen.

A visible light photoredox&#8208;induced approach for the synthesis of substituted imidazoles via alkynes, glycine methyl ester, and thiophenol is presented. The reaction is driven via photoinduced exploration of alkynes and their combination with thiol, producing vinylic radical and its subsequent nucleophilic addition to glycine methyl ester as N&#8208;source to produce imidazoles via concurrent two C&#9472;N bond formations.








Abstract
A visible light photoredox&#8208;induced approach for the synthesis of substituted imidazoles via alkynes, glycine methyl ester, and thiophenol is presented. The reaction is facilitated by the photoinduced activation of alkynes, coupled with thiol, which generates a vinylic radical. This radical subsequently undergoes a nucleophilic addition to glycine methyl ester, serving as a nitrogen source, thereby leading to the formation of imidazoles through the concurrent creation of two carbon&#8208;nitrogen bonds.

         <title>Friedel&#8208;Crafts Reaction with Polyolefins as Alkylation Reagents and Poly(vinyl chloride) as Initiator</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an upcycling strategy converting waste polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) into monoalkylbenzenes via AlCl3&#8208;mediated Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation. With poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) as a cost&#8208;effective initiator and polyolefins as alkylation reagents under mild conditions, this method achieves complete polyolefin conversion while selectively yielding toluene, ethylbenzene, cumene, and n&#8208;propylbenzene.








Abstract
Chemical upcycling of waste plastic has attracted substantial attention. While current upcycling methods are typically successful in converting single&#8208;component plastic waste, conversion of mixed plastics resembling real&#8208;world plastic waste with a single catalytic system remains a challenge. In this manuscript, we report an upcycling method suitable for a range of polyolefins (including mixtures of PP, LDPE, HDPE, and PVC, the four most produced plastics), which selectively produces toluene, ethylbenzene, cumene, and propylbenzene in the presence of benzene. The generation of ethylbenzene and cumene as major upcycling products, currently produced from ethylene or propylene and benzene, effectively circumvents the thermodynamically unfavorable depolymerization of polyolefins, allowing polyolefins to function as olefin surrogates in organic transformations. The utilization of inexpensive AlCl3 as a pre&#8208;catalyst, tolerance to additives, and mild reaction conditions render this method readily adapted by the current industry setup. Therefore, this upcycling method may have some significant impact on the mitigation of the waste plastic crisis.

         <title>What Makes a Branched Aromatic Compound a Crystallization Chaperone? Insights from a Comparison of Three Organic Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ability to accommodate guest molecules of many different shapes in crystal lattices has been tested for teraaryl derivatives of porphyrin, spirobifluorene, and adamantane. The latter appears to offer the most favorable properties, which may be at least partially due to low activation barriers for the interconversion of rotamers.








Abstract
Some tetraaryladamantane (TAA) octa&#8208; and tetraethers have the ability to crystallize into well&#8208;ordered lattices without full desolvation. In many cases, the solvates then yield high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray crystal structures of the encapsulated liquids. To shed light on this unusual effect of TAAs as crystallization chaperones, we have synthesized a series of spirobiflourene and porphyrin derivatives with four phenyl arms also found in TAA chaperones. Despite the structural similarity, neither of the non&#8208;TAA compounds showed promising crystallization properties. Six new X&#8208;ray crystal structures were obtained, but neither gave a high&#8208;resolution structure of an encapsulated guest. Quantum chemical computations suggest that conformational changes have low activation barriers for the TAAs, which may help to adapt to the structures of guest molecules in tightly packed arrangements. These findings on supramolecular chemistry in the crystalline state may help to design new chaperones with improved properties.

         <title>Microwave Radiation for Organolithium Chemistry: Mechanistic Studies on the Direct &#945;&#8208;Metalation of a Tertiary Amine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the use of microwave radiation to lithium chemistry, specifically in the kinetically hindered deprotonation of a tertiary amine at high temperatures without polar additives. The amine acts as substrate and deaggregation agent as shown by a solid&#8208;state structure. The lithium compounds remain stable at the harsh conditions and the deprotonated amine is storage&#8208;stable, facilitating diverse follow&#8208;up chemistry.








Abstract
Deprotonation reactions with lithium alkyls exhibit a high temperature dependency. However, the reactivity of lithium alkyls with conventionally used Lewis bases limits their deprotonation capability of more challenging substrates like tertiary amines. Therefore, we have focused on the use of high but exactly set reaction temperatures by usage of microwave radiation in the deprotonation reaction of a tertiary amine in the absence of polar additives. Our study proves the robustness of lithium alkyls, like t&#8208;butyllithium and &#945;&#8208;metalated tertiary amines under microwave conditions. A solid&#8208;state structure of the prelithiation aggregate and quantum chemical calculations offer an insight into the mechanism, revealing that the substrate amine performs as Lewis base for deaggregation itself. By our method, N&#8208;methylpiperidine was deprotonated without any intermediate or possibly toxic reaction steps, solvents, or additives, solely with t&#8208;butyllithium in the microwave with 56% yield. By using design of experiments we identified the most important factors for a successful deprotonation, revealing the closed reaction conditions under pressure and an excess of amine to be crucial. This investigation proves the high potential of microwave radiation in lithium chemistry, as it provides high but exact energy and introduces new possibilities for deprotonation reactions to overcome high kinetic reaction barriers.

         <title>Biphasic Continuous Esterification of Choline Chloride&#8208;Based Deep Eutectic Solvents using ICHEM Technology: A Step toward New Hydrotropes with Potential Anticorrosive Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Impact in Continuous Flow Heated Mechanochemistry (ICHEM) technology was used for the first biphasic continuous flow esterification of choline chloride&#8208;based deep eutectic solvents (DESs) with nonmiscible acetic, hexanoic, and octanoic anhydrides, resulting in the synthesis of novel hydrotropic DESs. The reaction was first optimized in batch using acetic anhydride, and then scaled up to continuous flow in an 80&#160;mL WAB Research Lab ICHEM reactor, achieving 90&#8211;95% yields at lab scales of 50&#8211;100&#160;g. The physicochemical properties of the three new DESs were analyzed, revealing that esterification via the ICHEM process had minimal impact on these properties compared to the conventional batch method. Furthermore, the potential of these new hydrotropic DESs as anticorrosive agents was evaluated, demonstrating their effectiveness as corrosion inhibitors.

         <title>Naming Matters: Hydridic Hydrogen Atoms are Halogen, Chalcogen, and Pnictogen Bond Acceptors not &#8220;Hydridic Hydrogen Bond&#8221; Donors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydridic hydrogen atoms (e.g., in Me3Ge&#9472;H) form directional noncovalent interactions with electrophilic Br, Se, and As centers. Through electrostatic and orbital analyses, these interactions are identified as halogen, chalcogen, and PnBs, not as &#8220;hydridic hydrogen bonds.&#8221; The study promotes clarity in nomenclature consistent with IUPAC guidelines.








Abstract
The definition and classification of noncovalent interactions are essential for consistent communication in supramolecular chemistry. A recent paper introduced the term &#8220;hydridic hydrogen bond&#8221; to describe interactions where hydrogen atoms bound to electropositive elements (e.g., Si, Ge, Sn) act as electron donors. However, such terminology conflicts with IUPAC definition, which requires hydrogen to be bonded to more electronegative atoms for a hydrogen bond (HB). Herein, we combine electrostatic potential analysis, energy decomposition, ELF/QTAIM, and NBO calculations to show that interactions involving hydridic hydrogen atoms as donors and heavier main group elements (Br, Se, As) as acceptors are better classified as halogen, chalcogen, and pnictogen bonds (PnBs), respectively. Our results confirm the nucleophilic character of hydridic hydrogen atoms and the electrophilic role of the interacting elements via &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;hole interactions, consistent with established IUPAC definitions. Experimental evidence from NMR supports this classification. By clarifying these interactions&#8217; nature and directionality, we advocate for nomenclature that aligns with chemical intuition and community standards, thereby avoiding confusion caused by unnecessary redefinitions.

&lt;p&gt;The definition and classification of noncovalent interactions are essential for consistent communication in supramolecular chemistry. A recent paper introduced the term &#8220;hydridic hydrogen bond&#8221; to describe interactions where hydrogen atoms bound to electropositive elements (e.g., Si, Ge, Sn) act as electron donors. However, such terminology conflicts with IUPAC definition, which requires hydrogen to be bonded to more electronegative atoms for a hydrogen bond (HB). Herein, we combine electrostatic potential analysis, energy decomposition, ELF/QTAIM, and NBO calculations to show that interactions involving hydridic hydrogen atoms as donors and heavier main group elements (Br, Se, As) as acceptors are better classified as halogen, chalcogen, and pnictogen bonds (PnBs), respectively. Our results confirm the nucleophilic character of hydridic hydrogen atoms and the electrophilic role of the interacting elements via &#963;- and &#960;-hole interactions, consistent with established IUPAC definitions. Experimental evidence from NMR supports this classification. By clarifying these interactions&#8217; nature and directionality, we advocate for nomenclature that aligns with chemical intuition and community standards, thereby avoiding confusion caused by unnecessary redefinitions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Heterochiral and Homochiral Peptides Conjugated to PNA Dimers and Their Integration in Peptide&#8208;Based Hydrogels</title>

Homochiral PNA&#8208;peptide conjugates mixed to homochiral peptides yield hydrogels supporting cell growth.








Abstract
Hybrid biomolecules composed of short peptides and nucleic acid analogues can self&#8208;assemble and are good candidates to produce new materials thanks to their biocompatibility and versatility. The assembly occurs by exploiting hydrogen bonds and stacking interactions between nucleobases and amino acids. The organization of the molecules at the supramolecular level is dictated by the structure of the assembling units. In this work we explored the effect of chirality on the self&#8208;assembly of PNA&#8208;peptide conjugates. We focused on homochiral and heterochiral peptides conjugated to PNA dimers and we characterized by spectroscopic techniques the assembled objects. Furthermore, we investigated the ability of the conjugates to form hydrogels in combination with the peptides. The architecture of the assembled molecules in the hydrogels was investigated, as well as the ability of hydrogels to support cell growth. Interestingly, hydrogels formed by homochiral and heterochiral mixtures show pores of different size. In the hydrogels cells grow along a specific direction, dictated by the fiber axis formed by the assembled compounds and their viability seems related to the gel pore size.

         <title>Unraveling Solvent&#8208;Dependent Chirality Inversion in the Self&#8208;Assembly of Glutamide Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide glutamide amphiphile (18NG) self&#8208;assembles into oppositely chiral supramolecular structures in MCH and DMSO, accompanied by a circular dichroism (CD) signal amplification due to the conformational transition of 18NG from folded to extended.








Abstract
This study investigates the solvent&#8208;modulated supramolecular chirality and assembly kinetics of two naphthalimide structural isomers, 18NG and 23NG, designed from glutamide derivatives linked to 1,8&#8208; and 2,3&#8208;naphthalic anhydrides, respectively. Time&#8208;dependent circular dichroism (CD) spectra reveal that 18NG exhibits chiroptical signal amplification with aging time and solvent&#8208;dependent chirality inversion: In methylcyclohexane (MCH), it forms chiral assemblies with a positive Cotton effect, whereas in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), it exhibits a negative Cotton effect. FT&#8208;IR and XRD analyses demonstrate stronger amide&#8211;amide hydrogen bonds in MCH and dominant hydrophobic interaction in DMSO, where DMSO acts as both a hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor (competing with intermolecular hydrogen bonds) and a high&#8208;polarity solvent promoting alkyl&#8208;chain aggregation. In contrast, 23NG assembles rapidly in both solvents without chirality inversion due to pre&#8208;exposed hydrogen&#8208;bonding motifs. These findings show how solvent dictates supramolecular chirality and packing by modulating noncovalent interactions, while structural isomerism governs assembly kinetics and solvent responsiveness. This work provides insights for designing adaptive chiral nanomaterials through molecular structure and solvent control.

         <title>Hierarchical MnO2 Nanoflowers and SnO2 Nanoparticles on Rhombohedral LaMnO3 for 2&#160;V Supercapacitor Electrodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A symmetric 2&#160;V aqueous symmetric supercapacitor using LaMnO3/MnO2 nanoflower hierarchical electrodes prepared using a simple direct chemical synthesis method exhibits superior performance over bare LaMnO3 and MnO2 electrodes. The enhanced performance is attributed to the effective Mn3+/Mn4+ redox transitions, improved interfacial charge transport, and synergistic interactions enabled by the hierarchical architecture.








Abstract
The strategy of forming hierarchical nanostructures of electroactive materials has shown enhancements in supercapacitor performances. In this study, two hierarchical electrodes are prepared by directly growing MnO2 nanoflowers and SnO2 nanoparticles on rhombohedral LaMnO3 nanostructures using a facile method. An extended potential window of 2&#160;V in a neutral aqueous electrolyte with superior electrochemical characteristics compared to pristine LaMnO3 electrodes is exhibited by these electrodes. Moreover, LaMnO3/MnO2 shows the best performance among the two hierarchical nanostructures. The optimized LaMnO3/MnO2 electrode delivers a high capacity of 426 C g&#8722;1 at a current density of 1 A g&#8722;1, nearly 4.6 times compared to pristine LaMnO3. This hierarchical electrode, due to the synergistic effect, exhibits appreciable cycling stability, outperforming the electrodes based on pristine MnO2 and LaMnO3. The aqueous symmetric supercapacitor fabricated using this electrode shows a capacity of 64 C g&#8722;1 (32 F g&#8722;1) at 1 A g&#8722;1, with a high energy density of 17.8 Whkg&#8722;1 at a constant power density of 2000&#160;W kg&#8722;1. Further, the device delivers 89% of its initial capacitance even after 10 000 charge/discharge operations at 10 A g&#8722;1. This study presents the possibility of using these hierarchical nanostructures in high&#8208;performance aqueous electrolyte supercapacitors (SCs).

         <title>Deep&#8208;Learning Driven Identification of Novel Antimicrobial Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using an AI&#8208;driven pipeline that couples HydrAMP sequence generation with AMPlify activity scoring, we evolved a short tryptophan&#8208;rich parent peptide into a mini&#8208;library of analogues, screened them in silico, and validated the top hits experimentally. The lead candidate, AMP3, shows high antimicrobial activity and membrane&#8208;disruptive ability, demonstrating the power of DL and rational peptide engineering to accelerate antimicrobial peptide discovery.








Abstract
In this study, we report the identification of novel antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) via a machine learning&#8208;driven pipeline. Short Trp&#8208;rich peptide sequences were obtained using the HydrAMP deep learning (DL) algorithm, followed by the in silico screening for antimicrobial activity via the AMPlify DL model. Three candidates, namely AMP1, AMP2, and AMP3, were selected for synthesis and experimental validation. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated in vitro against a panel of Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacterial strains. Among them, AMP3 demonstrated the broader antibacterial spectrum. To investigate the mechanisms of action, we conducted detailed biophysical analyses of AMP3 interaction with liposomal models of bacterial membranes. The data revealed significant perturbation of membrane bilayer stability, supporting the proposed membrane&#8208;targeting activity of AMP3. Overall, our results underscore the potential of DL approaches for the accelerated discovery and mechanistic characterization of novel AMPs.

         <title>Mechanism of Oxidative C&#9472;H Bond Activation by De Novo Designed Artificial Cu Metalloenzymes Using H2O2 and O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanism of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde peroxidation by de novo&#8208;designed Artificial Cu Proteins (ArCuPs) is investigated. A PCET step involving H+ transfer from benzylic C&#9472;H bond to CuII&#9472;OH and ET from O&#8208;centered substrate radical to CuII is found to be the RDS. Outer&#8208;sphere steric modifications alter reactivity. The most active variant produces the least amount of detrimental OH and is the most thermostable. 








Abstract
De novo&#8208;designed artificial Cu protein (ArCuP), 3SCC, featuring a trigonal Cu(His)3 binding environment, activates H2O2, O2, and benzylic C&#9472;H bonds of abiotic substrates. We outline the mechanism of ArCuP&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;H peroxidation of one such abiotic substrate, the peroxidation of benzyl alcohol (BA) to benzaldehyde. The CuI(H2O2) complex undergoes homolytic cleavage, producing CuII&#8208;OH and &#8226;OH, akin to the lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs). The rate&#8208;limiting step is found in a PCET process, where the CuII&#8208;OH species accepts the benzylic C&#9472;H proton, accompanied by electron transfer from the O&#8208;centered substrate radical, to produce benzaldehyde. The C&#9472;H peroxidation is modulated by outer&#8208;sphere modifications, with the I12A&#8208;3SCC variant having the highest catalytic proficiency. Combined &#8226;OH monitoring and proteomics analysis reveal that the I12A variant produces the least amount of &#8226;OH, indicating no oxidation of the active site His residues, unlike other ArCuPs. The chemical and thermal stability of the I12A variant contributes to its superior reactivity. The presence of substrate significantly lowers protein&#8208;level oxidation, similar to LPMOs and other Cu and heme&#8208;based enzymes.

         <title>Mellitic Acid as a Stable Abiotic Precursor for Liquid&#8208;Liquid Phase Separation: An RNA&#8208;Independent Pathway for Prebiotic Compartmentalization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Evidence is presented that prebiotically accessible mellitic (benzenehexacarboxylic) acid (MAc) is forming liquid droplets with short poly&#8208;L&#8208;lysine. The capacity of MAc to induce liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation with short oligocations, along with abiotic synthesis routes, makes MAc a viable candidate for an ingredient of early prebiotic membraneless organelles.








Abstract
Apart from playing the well&#8208;recognized roles in the self&#8208;assembly of intracellular machinery liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) constitutes a hypothetical, yet compelling scenario for prebiotic compartmentalization. One challenge facing this idea is the absence (or scarcity) of typical biopolymer precursors of liquid droplets, such as RNA, on early Earth. We demonstrate that mellitic acid (MAc), an abiotic component found in certain minerals and a marker of organic matter in astrobiology, forms liquid droplets with poly&#8208;L&#8208;lysine (PLL) across a broad pH range and various mixing ratios. The chain&#8208;length threshold of PLL capable of forming droplets with MAc ((L&#8208;Lys)6) is significantly lower than when ATP, the primary intracellular energy currency, is used to induce LLPS in PLL. MAc&#8208;PLL droplets are highly dynamic systems that respond reversibly to added ATP through an efficient mixing and demixing behavior. The observed effects of pH, ionic strength, temperature, and pressure, as well as isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) data, are all consistent with coulombic interactions being the key contributor to maintaining the droplet state in the MAc&#8208;PLL system. We propose that the capacity to induce LLPS with short oligocations, along with abiotic synthesis routes, positions mellitic acid as a viable candidate for an ingredient of early prebiotic membraneless protocells.

         <title>Crystal Phase Engineering of Carbon Nitride: Advances in Regulation Strategies and Photocatalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graph abstract: This review systematically explores the crystal phase engineering strategy of carbon nitridebased photocatalysts, contrasting the distinct properties, modification, and application of graphite, crystalline, and amorphous phases. At the end, some future developmental directions and challeges for carbon nitride with different crystal structures were also put forward.








Abstract
Crystal phase engineering emerges as a pivotal strategy to overcome the inherent limitations (e.g., structural defects, rapid charge recombination, and insufficient light absorption), plaguing conventional graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) synthesized by thermal polymerization for photocatalysis. This review systematically explores this innovative approach, contrasting the distinct properties and photocatalytic advantages of graphite, crystalline (CCN), and amorphous (ACN) carbon nitride phases. CCN leverages an extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated system for superior charge transport and enhanced light absorption, while ACN exploits abundant vacancies to reduce reaction barriers, narrow the bandgap, and improve light harvesting. We critically assess their performance in diverse applications (H2O2 production, H2 evolution, CO2 reduction, pollutant degradation, biomass oxidation), emphasizing the decisive role of the engineered crystal phase in optimizing activity. Despite progress, challenges in efficiency, stability, and complex&#8208;condition applicability persist. Future research must prioritize refining synthesis for precise phase control, enhancing operational stability, and elucidating underlying reaction mechanisms to advance practical environmental and energy applications.

Is it a boron atom, or is it a carbon atom? Given that BO33&#8722; and CO32&#8722; have very similar geometries, one can easily be mistaken for the other. In this paper we detail the probable mischaracterization of a supposed BO33&#8722;&#8208;containing complex.








Abstract
The trinuclear copper complex originally formulated as {[Cu(bpy)2]3BO3}(ClO4)4.2O, purportedly containing a triply bridging BO33&#8722; ligand, appears to be the known complex {[Cu(bpy)2]3CO3}(ClO4)4.0.5H2O, containing a triply bridging carbonate ligand.

         <title>Oxidant&#8208;Free Amidation of Aldehydes Enabled by Electrophotocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrophotocatalytic method for C(sp2)&#8211;N bond formation via radical&#8208;polar crossover (RPC)&#8208;HAT catalysis is presented. The mild operating conditions enable functionalization of a wide range of compounds, with electricity as the sole oxidant.








Abstract
Electrophotocatalysis (EPC) is emerging as a powerful tool in organic synthesis, offering unique redox transformations without the need for sacrificial oxidants or reductants. Building on this activation mode, we have developed an electrophotocatalytic method for the direct amidation of aldehydes, utilizing electricity and protons as oxidants and light to generate chlorine radicals for hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). This sustainable approach is compatible with a wide range of aldehydes and nitrogen&#8208;based nucleophiles, performing efficiently under batch conditions and demonstrating scalability with flow technology. The mild reaction conditions, adequate functional group tolerance, and versatility make this EPC protocol particularly suitable for C&#9472;N bond formation, enabling functionalization of diverse organic compounds and facilitating late&#8208;stage modifications in drug development.

         <title>Automation of Multistep Reaction&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;Phase Synthesis Using Novel Polystyrene&#8208;Coated Magnetic Particles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel magnetic particles were developed to enable automated high&#8208;throughput multistep synthesis on small&#8208;scale. A covalently linked polystyrene shell efficiently protects the encapsulated magnetic iron core to avoid metal release in commonly used solvents, at elevated temperatures and over a broad pH range, thus providing appropriate magnetic properties allowing full automation of multistep reaction sequences.








Abstract
We have developed novel types of polystyrene&#8208;coated magnetic particles for versatile applications in multistep reaction&#8208;based solid&#8208;phase organic synthesis. These particles feature a protective polymer shell that allows them to function under various reaction conditions while maintaining the beneficial properties of traditional polystyrene beads, such as swelling and shrinking in organic solvents. We applied the particles in diverse multistep syntheses, including and combining amide couplings, nucleophilic aromatic substitutions, and Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura couplings at tens of micromole scale. The ferrimagnetic property of the particles enables their reversible immobilization using an external magnetic field, facilitating efficient reagent change cycles through simple aspiration of the separated supernatant liquid. This immobilization principle was applied to particle conditioning, reactions, washing, deprotection, and linker cleavage, allowing for fully automated parallel syntheses in microtiter plates using an automated liquid&#8208;handling system. This platform has already become routine for hit syntheses from various high&#8208;throughput screening campaigns and will enable the efficient production of a wide variety of new compounds by solid&#8208;phase synthesis. Ongoing developments on magnetic particles, reaction conditions, and automated processing will further extend the application range in medicinal chemistry and beyond.

         <title>Thorium Bis&#8208;Salophen Trimers as Anion Detectors and Binding Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of a thorium trimer 3:3 with &#916;,&#916;,&#916;&#8208;chirality and a pore in the center for anion binding.








Abstract
Bis&#8208;salophen ligands are the condensation product of a tetramine and a salicylaldehyde derivative. They feature two binding sites, both of which are tetradentate with mixed O/N donor atoms. Reaction with the ligand precursor and thorium nitrate tetrahydrate forms a 3:3 metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand trimer with a &#916;&#916;&#916;&#8208;chirality confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography of a racemic single crystal. The structure has a pore in the center of the triangular structure measuring 6.22&#160;&#197; at its narrowest point. This compound is air&#8208; and water&#8208;stable as well as soluble in organic solvents. This compound was screened with a series of tetrabutyl ammonium halide salts, and tetrabutylammonium (TBA) chloride showed the strongest binding to the complex. After the addition of 2 equivalents of TBACl, the complex and salt precipitate out of solution.

         <title>Long Used but Hardly Known: Synthesis and Crystal Structure of Tritium Breeding Li2Be2O3</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ternary oxide Li2Be2O3 was synthesized in a HT approach starting from Li2O and BeO using a radiofrequency furnace. Although, the compound has been known for almost 60 years, its crystal structure has only now been elucidated and a phase&#8208;pure synthesis makes the determination of directly assignable properties possible. Li2Be2O3 is discussed for its usage in fusion reactors, as it breeds essential tritium under neutron irradiation.








Abstract
A main challenge for the operation of a nuclear fusion reactor is the consumption of tritium during the fusion process and the limited availability of tritium in natural resources or its production in nuclear power plants. The most promising approach is breeding of new tritium within the operating fusion reactor. For this purpose, suitable breeding materials are needed. Lithium beryllium oxides are a promising class of compounds, as they unite both target and neutron multiplier in one material. While there have already been studies on sintered ceramics in the Li2O&#183;BeO system, the crystal structure of compounds of a defined composition has so far remained unsolved. Herein, we report on the synthesis of phase&#8208;pure Li2Be2O3 in a high&#8208;temperature (HT) approach and its structure determination by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (sc&#8208;XRD). In addition, the compound was characterized by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD), solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. The thermal stability, which is important for use as blanket material in a fusion reactor, was examined with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).

         <title>Alkali Metal Complexes of a Phosphine&#8208;Functionalized Cyclooctatetraene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel phosphine&#8722;functionalized COT ligand and its inverse sandwich alkali metal complexes (Na, K, Rb, and Cs) were synthesized and structurally characterized. The polymeric architectures vary with the metal ion and crystallization solvent, with an eight&#8208;membered ring obtained for Rb in benzene. UV&#8722;Vis and photophysical studies reveal luminescent properties.








Abstract
The distinctive electronic properties and wide range of applications of cyclooctatetraene (COT) sandwich complexes make exploring this class of compounds essential. The new phosphine&#8208;functionalized proligand 1,4&#8722;bis(dimethylsilylmethyl)diphenylphosphinecycloocta&#8722;2,5,7&#8722;triene, {C8H8&#8722;1,4&#8722;(Me2SiCH2PPh2)2}, was synthesized by reaction of K2COT with Me2Si(Cl)CH2PPh2 first. Subsequent deprotonation with various alkali metal bases led to a series of alkali metal complexes [M2{C8H6&#8722;1,4&#8722;(Me2SiCH2PPh2)2}] (M&#160;=&#160;Na, K, Rb, Cs). Notably, the crystallization solvent and the alkali metals significantly influenced the polymeric architecture and led to structural diversity of all complexes. For instance, the two phosphine arms either coordinate both to one metal atom, while the other metal ion is uncoordinated, or, in other structures, each metal atom is equally coordinated by just one phosphine function. Additionally, the coordination behavior of the pendant phosphine groups determines the emissive nature of these complexes. In all cases, polymeric structures are formed, in which intermolecular interactions between the COT ring and a metal atom are observed. Additionally, Rb forms a benzene&#8208;bridged eight&#8208;membered polymeric structure [{Rb2(C8H6&#8722;1,4&#8722;(Me2SiCH2PPh2)2) (C6H6)2}8]&#8734;. Additionally, the lighter alkali metals in [M2{C8H6&#8722;1,4&#8722;(Me2SiCH2PPh2)2}] can be exchanged by the heavier congeners by using the corresponding tert&#8722;butoxides.

         <title>Deep Learning for Hyperpolarized NMR of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins Without Resolution Loss: Access to Short&#8208;Lived Intermediates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
The inherently low sensitivity of solution&#8208;state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) has long limited its ability to characterize transient biomolecular states at atomic resolution. While dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (dDNP) offers a compensating signal enhancement, its broader use has been hindered by rapid polarization decay, causing severe spectral distortion. Here, we introduce HyperW&#8208;Decon, an approach that enables high&#8208;sensitivity, high&#8208;resolution NMR of biomolecules in solution. HyperW&#8208;Decon combines two key aspects: (i) the use of hyperpolarized water (HyperW) to transfer polarization to proteins through rapid proton exchange; and (ii) a theory&#8208;driven, machine learning (ML)&#8211;based deconvolution method that corrects polarization&#8208;induced artifacts without requiring external reference signals. This approach is based on a first&#8208;principles understanding of dDNP line shapes and delivers a scalable solution to spectral distortion.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inherently low sensitivity of solution-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) has long limited its ability to characterize transient biomolecular states at atomic resolution. While dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (dDNP) offers a compensating signal enhancement, its broader use has been hindered by rapid polarization decay, causing severe spectral distortion. Here, we introduce HyperW-Decon, an approach that enables high-sensitivity, high-resolution NMR of biomolecules in solution. HyperW-Decon combines two key aspects: (i) the use of hyperpolarized water (HyperW) to transfer polarization to proteins through rapid proton exchange; and (ii) a theory-driven, machine learning (ML)&#8211;based deconvolution method that corrects polarization-induced artifacts without requiring external reference signals. This approach is based on a first-principles understanding of dDNP line shapes and delivers a scalable solution to spectral distortion. Applied to intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) involved in biomineralization, HyperW-Decon reveals previously inaccessible, short-lived ion-peptide encounter complexes with residue resolution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>How to Track Mechanochemical Reactions in Resonant Acoustic Mixers by in Situ Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We define a practical operational window for in situ Raman monitoring in resonant acoustic mixing (RAM), a milling media&#8208;free alternative to ball milling. By optimizing key parameters, including vessel design, filling degree, and acceleration, we establish conditions that enable robust spectral acquisition across various mechanochemical transformations. This framework facilitates reliable reaction tracking in RAM.








Abstract
Mechanochemical processes have traditionally been explored using ball mills; however, resonant acoustic mixers (RAM) offer a compelling alternative, operating without milling media and enabling scalable, solvent&#8208;free synthesis. Despite their advantages, direct transfer of reaction conditions from ball mills to RAM has proven nontrivial, requiring careful optimization of key parameters. In this study, we systematically define an operational window for effective in situ Raman monitoring in RAM. Critical parameters&#8212;including vessel material, applied gravitational force, filling degree, substrate rheology, and reaction time&#8212;were assessed to ensure high&#8208;quality spectral acquisition. Utilizing a sapphire&#8208;glass window and a precisely aligned laser setup, we achieved strong, reproducible Raman signals under controlled conditions. The optimal window was found to include a minimum filling degree of 10% and applied g&#8208;forces between 20 and 70&#160;g. This framework was validated across diverse mechanochemical reactions, including organic condensations (Knoevenagel and quinoxaline), metal&#8208;organic framework formation (ZIF), and catalytic coupling (Glaser reaction), demonstrating the robustness and versatility of in situ Raman spectroscopy in RAM&#8208;based synthesis.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Sulfur&#8208;Mediated C&#8208;S Bond Formation: Mechanistic Insights from the state&#8208;crossing tRNA Methylthiolation by the Radical SAM Enzyme MiaB</title>

         <dc:description>
Iron&#8208;sulfur cluster chemistry: The mechanism of the MiaB&#8208;catalyzed methylthiolation of N6&#8208;isopentenyladenosine at position 37 in tRNA is elucidated. The reaction sequence clearly demonstrates that the state&#8208;crossing methylthiolation occurs following C2&#8208;H abstraction by 5&#8242;&#8208;dAdo&#8226;. Moreover, the essential role of the auxiliary [3Fe&#8208;4S] cluster is revealed, as it functions as both the methyl carrier and the direct sulfur donor during catalysis.








Abstract
The radical S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzyme MiaB is a bifunctional catalyst that mediates the posttranscriptional methylthiolation of N6&#8208;isopentenyladenosine (i6A37) at position 37 in tRNA. Herein, density functional calculations were employed to elucidate the two stages of MiaB&#8208;catalyzed modification: methylation and sulfur insertion at the C2 position of i6A37. MiaB contains two iron&#8208;sulfur clusters: a radical SAM cluster ([4Fe&#8208;4S]RS) and an auxiliary cluster ([3Fe&#8208;4S]Aux). Our calculations demonstrate that the [4Fe&#8208;4S]RS cluster is essential for generating the potent oxidant 5&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosyl radical (5&#8242;&#8208;dAdo&#8226;) via the reductive cleavage of SAM and that the [3Fe&#8208;4S]Aux cluster serves both as the carrier of methyl and as a direct sulfur donor during catalysis. Furthermore, it is revealed that a state crossing occurs during the methylthio installation at the substrate, which follows C2&#8208;H abstraction by 5&#8242;&#8208;dAdo&#8226;. Additionally, substituting Arg66 with glutamine highlights its critical role in stabilizing the substrate radical and modulating MiaB activity. Overall, our work advances the understanding of iron&#8208;sulfur cluster chemistry and inert C&#8208;H bond activation within the growing superfamily of radical SAM enzymes, offering insights for translating the catalytic advantages of natural enzymes into synthetic transition&#8208;metal complexes and functional materials.

         <title>Synthesis of Bistricyclic Aromatic Enes Containing Bifluorenylidene Units via Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Tandem Suzuki Coupling/Heck Cyclization Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
A series of bifluorenylidene&#8208;based BAEs and their derivatives have been prepared via the palladium&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki coupling/Heck cyclization tandem reaction in one pot from the substrates containing boronic ester groups and 2&#8208;bromophenyl trifluoromethanesulfonate or similar derivatives.








Abstract
A variety of bifluorenylidene&#8208;based bistricyclic aromatic enes (BAEs) and their derivatives have been prepared via the palladium&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki coupling/Heck cyclization tandem reaction in one pot. In the new scheme, 2&#8208;bromophenyl trifluoromethanesulfonate and similar derivatives were chosen as one of the reaction substrates, which could undergo a tandem Suzuki coupling/Heck cyclization reaction with suitable arylboronic acid ester substrates to afford the expected BAEs and their derivatives. In the newly designed scheme, the raw materials are easier to obtain and can be applied to the synthesis of more BAEs and their derivatives.

Tunable amine&#8208;functionalized silica catalysts with channel and wormhole like morphology utilized for CO2 fixation reaction into cyclic organic carbonates (COCs) from epoxides at atmospheric pressure.








Abstract
A silica catalyst with characteristic features of broad pore size distribution, large pore width and tunable basic sites was synthesized by a one&#8208;step green co&#8208;condensation synthesis method analogous to SBA&#8208;15 synthesis. The surface chemical features of the above catalyst were explored by XPS, N2 and CO2 adsorption and desorption experiments. The catalyst showed 90% conversion of styrene oxide (SO) with nearly complete selectivity toward styrene carbonate (SC) in 7&#160;hours under a solvent&#8208;free condition at a temperature of 120&#160;&#176;C with the aid of co&#8208;catalyst tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB). Moreover, the catalyst demonstrates versatility with various epoxide substrates, providing valuable insights into the cycloaddition reaction under ambient pressure conditions involving carbon dioxide. The mechanistic details of the catalytic conversion were investigated by the in&#8208;situ DRIFT studies and reported here.

         <title>Dynamic Combinatorial Chemistry Generates Adaptative Libraries of Glyco&#8208;Dyn[n]Arenes That can Be Templated to Produce Anti&#8208;Adhesive Glycoconjugates Targeting Pseudomonas aeruginosa</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

DCC enables the formation of glycocluster libraries through reversible disulfide exchange. Nanomolar ligands for multiple lectins (ConA, LecA, and LecB) were identified in a simple experimental set up, purified, and displayed nanomolar affinity with anti&#8208;infectious properties.








Abstract
Carbohydrate&#8208;protein interactions are important in cell&#8208;cell communication, signal transduction, cancer, or infection. Chemists have designed glycosylated multivalent systems to mimic these recognition phenomena and produce potent ligands of lectins with therapeutic applications. Dynamic combinatorial chemistry (DCC) provides access to libraries of glycosylated macrocycles equilibrating through reversible covalent bonds. This strategy can be applied to the rapid and efficient identification of multivalent glycoclusters by introducing a protein into the equilibrating library. This strategy allowed the identification of the best ligands for more than one lectin in a single experimental set up by using two simple 1,4&#8208;dithiophenol building blocks. Selection of the best binder by each lectin (ConA, LecA, and LecB) was accompanied by the amplification of glyco&#8208;dyn[3]arenes and glyco&#8208;dyn[4]arenes. These macrocycles could be synthesized, isolated, and displayed nanomolar dissociation constants. Furthermore, while no toxicity could be detected against human cells or bacteria, their anti&#8208;adhesive properties against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were confirmed through a virulence assay on human cells. Altogether, extremely simple 1,4&#8208;dithiophenol building blocks provided access to a large diversity of glycoconjugates that could be selected by a lectin in a simple experimental set up to identify glycoconjugates with potential anti&#8208;infectious applications, thus speeding up the discovery of potential new antibacterial treatments.

&lt;p&gt;DCC enables the formation of glycocluster libraries through reversible disulfide exchange. Nanomolar ligands for multiple lectins (ConA, LecA, and LecB) were identified in a simple experimental set up, purified, and displayed nanomolar affinity with anti-infectious properties.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbohydrate-protein interactions are important in cell-cell communication, signal transduction, cancer, or infection. Chemists have designed glycosylated multivalent systems to mimic these recognition phenomena and produce potent ligands of lectins with therapeutic applications. Dynamic combinatorial chemistry (DCC) provides access to libraries of glycosylated macrocycles equilibrating through reversible covalent bonds. This strategy can be applied to the rapid and efficient identification of multivalent glycoclusters by introducing a protein into the equilibrating library. This strategy allowed the identification of the best ligands for more than one lectin in a single experimental set up by using two simple 1,4-dithiophenol building blocks. Selection of the best binder by each lectin (ConA, LecA, and LecB) was accompanied by the amplification of glyco-dyn[3]arenes and glyco-dyn[4]arenes. These macrocycles could be synthesized, isolated, and displayed nanomolar dissociation constants. Furthermore, while no toxicity could be detected against human cells or bacteria, their anti-adhesive properties against &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; were confirmed through a virulence assay on human cells. Altogether, extremely simple 1,4-dithiophenol building blocks provided access to a large diversity of glycoconjugates that could be selected by a lectin in a simple experimental set up to identify glycoconjugates with potential anti-infectious applications, thus speeding up the discovery of potential new antibacterial treatments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemical Properties of an Aryloxenium Cation with a Triplet Electronic Ground State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryloxenium cations contain a formally positively&#8208;charged, monovalent oxygen atom with an incomplete electron shell. In spite of this unusual structural element, they are key intermediates in many important processes, such as biological oxidation reactions and the industrial generation of thermoplastics. However, the development of new applications is hindered by the lack of knowledge on their fundamental chemical properties. While most past studies have focused on aryloxenium cations with singlet electronic ground states, minor structural modifications can produce aryloxenium cations that have a triplet ground state. Unfortunately, examination of the reactivity of triplet aryloxenium cations is limited to just two studies that reported the detection of H atom abstraction from solvents. A detailed kinetic reactivity study involving cyclohexane, allyl iodide and dimethyl disulfide reagents is reported here for an aryloxenium cation with a triplet electronic ground state, the 2&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;pyridyloxenium cation.</dc:description>
