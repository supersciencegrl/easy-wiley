NHPI engaged MOFs: Two UiO metal&#8208;organic frameworks covalently merged with N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide organocatalytic sites have been synthesized. Comprehensive studies on the MOF characteristics and optimal reaction condition and mechanism, show an unprecedented three&#8208;phase heterogeneous system has been established for catalytic oxidation of a wide scope of primary and secondary alcohols, and benzyl compounds. The catalytic oxidation manifests high efficiency, excellent selectivity, requires mild conditions, and is environmentally friendly with molecular O2 as terminal oxidant.







Abstract
Two highly efficient metal&#8208;organic framework catalysts TJU&#8208;68&#8208;NHPI and TJU&#8208;68&#8208;NDHPI have been successfully synthesized through solvothermal reactions of which the frameworks are merged with N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) units, resulting in the decoration of pore surfaces with highly active nitroxyl catalytic sites. When t&#8208;butyl nitrite (TBN) is used as co&#8208;catalyst, the as&#8208;synthesized MOFs are demonstrated to be highly efficient and recyclable catalysts for a novel three&#8208;phase heterogeneous oxidation of activated C&#8722;H bond of primary and secondary alcohols, and benzyl compounds under mild conditions. Based on the high efficiency and selectivity, an environmentally benign system with good sustainability, mild conditions, simple work&#8208;up procedure has been established for practical oxidation of a wide range of substrates.

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Organic Polysulfides from Disulfides by Sulfur Insertion from S8 and an Unexpected Solvent Effect on the Product Distribution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrifying Sulfur! The electrolysis of organic disulfides in dichloromethane led to the formation of organic polysulfides with a high incorporation of additional sulfur atoms. HPLC/HRMS analysis of the reaction mixture could identify products up to undecasulfides. When CS2 was used as co&#8208;solvent the distribution of the organic polysulfide mixture was altered in favor of the lower polysulfides, such as tri&#8208; and tetrasulfides.







Abstract
An electrochemical synthesis of organic polysulfides through sulfur insertion from elemental sulfur to disulfides or thiols is introduced. The highly economic, low&#8208;sensitive and low&#8208;priced reaction gives a mixture of polysulfides, whose distribution can be influenced by the addition of different amounts of carbon disulfide as co&#8208;solvent. To describe the variable distribution function of the polysulfides, a novel parameter, the &#8220;absorbance average sulfur amount in polysulfides&#8221; (SAP) was introduced and defined on the basis of the &#8220;number average molar mass&#8221; used in polymer chemistry. Various organic polysulfides were synthesized with variable volume fractions of carbon disulfide, and the yield of each polysulfide was determined by quantitative 13C NMR. Moreover, by using two symmetrical disulfides or a disulfide and a thiol as starting materials, a mixture of symmetrical and asymmetrical polysulfides could be obtained.

         <title>E4 Transfer (E=P, As) to Ni Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accessing the inaccessible: The use of the polypnictogen zirconium complexes [Cp&#8242;&#8242;2Zr(&#951;1:1&#8208;E4)] (E=P, As) at ambient temperatures as phosphorus or arsenic sources to transfer E4&#8197;units to CpRNi fragments was examined. This avoids the difficulty of handling and toxicity of white phosphorus and yellow arsenic. The transfer reactions gave access to a variety of polypnictogen transition metal complexes, among them unprecedented triple&#8208;decker&#8208;like compounds composed of cage entities as end&#8208;decks.







Abstract
The use of [Cp&#8242;&#8242;2Zr(&#951;1:1&#8208;E4)] (E=P (1&#8201;a), As (1&#8201;b), Cp&#8242;&#8242;=1,3&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;cyclopentadienyl) as phosphorus or arsenic source, respectively, gives access to novel stable polypnictogen transition metal complexes at ambient temperatures. The reaction of 1&#8201;a/1&#8201;b with [CpRNiBr]2 (CpR=CpBn (1,2,3,4,5&#8208;pentabenzyl&#8208;cyclopentadienyl), Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242; (1,2,4&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;cyclopentadienyl)) was studied, to yield novel complexes depending on steric effects and stoichiometric ratios. Besides the transfer of the complete En unit, a degradation as well as aggregation can be observed. Thus, the prismane derivatives [(Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Ni)2(&#956;,&#951;3:3&#8208;E4)] (2&#8201;a (E=P); 2&#8201;b (E=As)) or the arsenic containing cubane [(Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Ni)3(&#956;3&#8208;As)(As4)] (5) are formed. Furthermore, the bromine bridged cubanes of the type [(CpRNi)3{Ni(&#956;&#8208;Br)}(&#956;3&#8208;E)4]2 (CpR=Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;: 6&#8201;a (E=P), 6&#8201;b (E=As), CpR=CpBn: 8&#8201;a (E=P), 8&#8201;b (E=As)) can be isolated. Here, a stepwise transfer of En units is possible, with a cyclo&#8208;E42&#8722; ligand being introduced and unprecedented triple&#8208;decker compounds of the type [{(CpRNi)3Ni(&#956;3&#8208;E)4}2(&#956;,&#951;4:4&#8208;E&#8242;4)] (CpR=CpBn, Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;; E/E&#8242;=P, As) are obtained.

         <title>Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence and Phosphorescence Quenching in Iminophosphonamide Copper and Zinc Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To glow or not to glow: Chiral iminophosphonamide copper and zinc complexes are presented. Some steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence (PL) features studied at low temperatures can be described within the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) scheme. However, unusually, the fluorescence is nearly absent in two complexes and the low&#8208;lying triplet state quenches PL. Some excited states were further investigated by time&#8208;resolved FTIR spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations.







Abstract
The synthesis of copper and zinc complexes of four variably substituted iminophosphonamide ligands is presented. While the copper complexes form ligand&#8208;bridged dimers, the zinc compounds are monomeric. Due to different steric demand of the ligand the arrangement of the ligands within the dimeric complexes varies. Similar to the structurally related iminophosphonamide complexes of alkali metals and calcium, the steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence (PL) of four of the seven compounds studied here as solids in a temperature range of 5&#8211;295&#8197;K can be described within the scheme of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Accordingly, they exhibit bright blue&#8208;green phosphorescence at low temperatures (&lt;100&#8197;K), which turns into delayed fluorescence by increasing the temperature. However, unusually, the fluorescence is practically absent in two copper complexes which otherwise still conform to the TADF scheme. In these cases, the excited singlet states decay essentially non&#8208;radiatively and their thermal population from the corresponding low&#8208;lying triplet states efficiently quenches PL (phosphorescence). Three other copper and zinc complexes only exhibit prompt fluorescence, evidencing a wide variation of photophysical properties in this class of compounds. The excited states of the copper complex with especially pronounced phosphorescence quenching were also investigated by low&#8208;temperature time&#8208;resolved infrared spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations.

Some excited states were further investigated by time-resolved FTIR spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of copper and zinc complexes of four variably substituted iminophosphonamide ligands is presented. While the copper complexes form ligand-bridged dimers, the zinc compounds are monomeric. Due to different steric demand of the ligand the arrangement of the ligands within the dimeric complexes varies. Similar to the structurally related iminophosphonamide complexes of alkali metals and calcium, the steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) of four of the seven compounds studied here as solids in a temperature range of 5&#8211;295&#8197;K can be described within the scheme of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Accordingly, they exhibit bright blue-green phosphorescence at low temperatures (&amp;lt;100&#8197;K), which turns into delayed fluorescence by increasing the temperature. However, unusually, the fluorescence is practically absent in two copper complexes which otherwise still conform to the TADF scheme. In these cases, the excited singlet states decay essentially non-radiatively and their thermal population from the corresponding low-lying triplet states efficiently quenches PL (phosphorescence). Three other copper and zinc complexes only exhibit prompt fluorescence, evidencing a wide variation of photophysical properties in this class of compounds. The excited states of the copper complex with especially pronounced phosphorescence quenching were also investigated by low-temperature time-resolved infrared spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Bio&#8208;inspired and Eco&#8208;friendly Synthesis of 3D Spongy Meso&#8208;Microporous Carbons from CO2 for Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the structure of spongy bone, we synthesized 3D sponge&#8208;like porous carbons (SPCs) from CO2 in a home&#8208;made electrolytic cell equipped with low&#8208;temperature molten carbonate electrolyte. SPC4&#8208;0.5 shows excellent electrochemical capacitance performance due to its large&#8208;area meso&#8208;microporous structure, excellent wettability and electronical conductivity. Our research presents a simple, eco&#8208;friendly and low&#8208;cost way towards production of functional carbon materials.







Abstract
Inspired by the spongy bone structures, three&#8208;dimensional (3D) sponge&#8208;like carbons with meso&#8208;microporous structures are synthesized through one&#8208;step electro&#8208;reduction of CO2 in molten carbonate Li2CO3&#8722;Na2CO3&#8722;K2CO3 at 580&#8201;&#176;C. SPC4&#8208;0.5 (spongy porous carbon obtained by electrolysis of CO2 at 4&#8197;A for 0.5&#8197;h) is synthesized with the current efficiency of 96.9&#8201;%. SPC4&#8208;0.5 possesses large electrolyte ion accessible surface area, excellent wettability and electronical conductivity, ensuring the fast and effective mass and charge transfer, which make it an advcanced supercapacitor electrode material. SPC4&#8208;0.5 exhibits a specific capacitance as high as 373.7&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, excellent cycling stability (retaining 95.9&#8201;% of the initial capacitance after 10000 cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), as well as high energy density. The applications of SPC4&#8208;0.5 in quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state symmetric supercapacitor and all&#8208;solid&#8208;state flexible devices for energy storage and wearable piezoelectric sensor are investigated. Both devices show considerable capacitive performances. This work not only presents a controllable and facile synthetic route for the porous carbons but also provides a promising way for effective carbon reduction and green energy production.

         <title>Modulation of Src Kinase Activity by Selective Substrate Recognition with Pseudopeptidic Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How to spare Tyr: The selective recognition of tyrosine residues by pseudopeptidic cages protects the substrates from Src kinase&#8208;promoted phosphorylation. The Tyr kinase&#8208;inhibiting activity of the cages can be satisfactorily explained by the formation of host&#8208;guest complexes. This supramolecular approach represents an appealing alternative to modulating Tyr kinase activity by substrate recognition.







Abstract
The selective recognition of tyrosine residues in peptides is an appealing approach to inhibiting their tyrosine kinase (TK)&#8208;mediated phosphorylation. Herein, we describe pseudopeptidic cages that efficiently protect substrates from the action of the Src TK enzyme, precluding the corresponding Tyr phosphorylation. Fluorescence emission titrations show that the most efficient cage inhibitors strongly bind the peptide substrates with a very good correlation between the binding constant and the inhibitory potency. Structural insights and additional control experiments further support the proposed mechanism of selective supramolecular protection of the substrates. Moreover, the approach also works in a completely different kinase&#8208;substrate system. These results illustrate the potential of supramolecular complexes for the efficient and selective modulation of TK signaling.

         <title>Charge Transfer Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Containing Redox&#8208;Active TTF/NDI Units for Highly Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared Photothermal Conversion</title>

         <dc:description>
The heat is on: A charge&#8208;transfer MOF based on redox&#8208;active TTF/NDI units has been prepared and structurally characterized. Due to the efficient charge&#8208;transfer absorption in the NIR region, the MOF shows excellent photothermal conversion performance. Co&#8208;MOF@PDMS composite films have been studied and could be new candidates for stable and processable materials in photothermal therapy.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), as a class of new inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid crystal materials, could have important applications in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photothermal conversion. Herein, a new charge&#8208;transfer MOF (Co&#8208;MOF) with mixed ligands of H4TTFTB and bpmNDI incorporating redox&#8208;active tetrathiafulvalene/naphthalene diimide (TTF/NDI) units into one system is reported. Due to the presence of TTF/NDI oxidative and reductive couples, stable radicals can be observed in the MOF. In addition, charge transfer from the electron donor (TTF) to the acceptor (NDI) results in a broad absorption in the NIR region. The Co&#8208;MOF exhibited an efficient photothermal effect induced by irradiation with a NIR laser. Under the 808&#8197;nm laser (0.7&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2) illumination, the temperature of the Co&#8208;MOF increased from room temperature to 201&#8201;&#176;C in only 10&#8197;s. Furthermore, a series of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) films doped with trace amounts of Co&#8208;MOF showed efficient NIR photothermal conversion. When a Co&#8208;MOF@PDMS (0.6&#8197;wt&#8201;%) film is irradiated by 808&#8197;nm laser with power of 0.5&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2, it&#8242;s temperature can reach a plateau at 62&#8201;&#176;C from 20&#8201;&#176;C within 100&#8197;s. Our experimental results from the Co&#8208;MOF@PDMS film demonstrate that the effectiveness and feasibility of the material is promising for photothermal applications.

         <title>Synergistic DNA&#8208; and Protein&#8208;Based Recognition Promote an RNA&#8208;Templated Bio&#8208;orthogonal Reaction</title>

DNA, Protein, RNA: The structure&#8208;based design of biomolecular conjugates composed of protein and DNA fragments that synergistically bind RNA via Watson&#8208;Crick base pairing and peptide&#8208;mediated major groove recognition is reported. Two distinct conjugate families with tunable binding characteristics were designed whereby two conjugates can simultaneously assemble on a single RNA scaffold. Through ternary complex formation, the peptide elements of each conjugate are drawn into close proximity, and this feature was exploited to enable an RNA&#8208;templated, double click reaction.







Abstract
Biomolecular assemblies composed of proteins and oligonucleotides play a central role in biological processes. While in nature, oligonucleotides and proteins usually assemble via non&#8208;covalent interactions, synthetic conjugates have been developed which covalently link both modalities. The resulting peptide&#8208;oligonucleotide conjugates have facilitated novel biological applications as well as the design of functional supramolecular systems and materials. However, despite the importance of concerted protein/oligonucleotide recognition in nature, conjugation approaches have barely utilized the synergistic recognition abilities of such complexes. Herein, the structure&#8208;based design of peptide&#8208;DNA conjugates that bind RNA through Watson&#8208;Crick base pairing combined with peptide&#8208;mediated major groove recognition is reported. Two distinct conjugate families with tunable binding characteristics have been designed to adjacently bind a particular RNA sequence. In the resulting ternary complex, their peptide elements are located in proximity, a feature that was used to enable an RNA&#8208;templated click reaction. The introduced structure&#8208;based design approach opens the door to novel functional biomolecular assemblies.

         <title>Applying Unconventional Spectroscopies to the Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets, Co(PPh3)2X2 (X=Cl, Br, I): Unveiling Magnetic Transitions and Spin&#8208;Phonon Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct determination of magnetic excited levels and spin&#8208;phonon couplings in the compounds in three SMMs, leading to magnetic relaxation, has been achieved by the combined use of inelastic neutron scattering (INS), far&#8208;IR magnetic spectroscopy (FIRMS), high&#8208;frequency and &#8208;field EPR, frequency&#8208;domain FT terahertz EPR, ligand&#8208;field theory (LFT) analysis, and DFT calculations of phonons (i.&#8201;e., both molecular and lattice vibrations). Calculated spin densities on Co(II) ions correlate with magnetic separations in the compounds.







Abstract
Large separation of magnetic levels and slow relaxation in metal complexes are desirable properties of single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs). Spin&#8208;phonon coupling (interactions of magnetic levels with phonons) is ubiquitous, leading to magnetic relaxation and loss of memory in SMMs and quantum coherence in qubits. Direct observation of magnetic transitions and spin&#8208;phonon coupling in molecules is challenging. We have found that far&#8208;IR magnetic spectra (FIRMS) of Co(PPh3)2X2 (Co&#8208;X; X=Cl, Br, I) reveal rarely observed spin&#8208;phonon coupling as avoided crossings between magnetic and u&#8208;symmetry phonon transitions. Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) gives phonon spectra. Calculations using VASP and phonopy programs gave phonon symmetries and movies. Magnetic transitions among zero&#8208;field split (ZFS) levels of the S=3/2 electronic ground state were probed by INS, high&#8208;frequency and &#8208;field EPR (HFEPR), FIRMS, and frequency&#8208;domain FT terahertz EPR (FD&#8208;FT THz&#8208;EPR), giving magnetic excitation spectra and determining ZFS parameters (D, E) and g values. Ligand&#8208;field theory (LFT) was used to analyze earlier electronic absorption spectra and give calculated ZFS parameters matching those from the experiments. DFT calculations also gave spin densities in Co&#8208;X, showing that the larger Co(II) spin density in a molecule, the larger its ZFS magnitude. The current work reveals dynamics of magnetic and phonon excitations in SMMs. Studies of such couplings in the future would help to understand how spin&#8208;phonon coupling may lead to magnetic relaxation and develop guidance to control such coupling.

         <title>Alkali&#8208;induced Transformation of Ni&#8208;MOF into Ni(OH)2 Nanostructured Flowers for Efficient Electrocatalytic Methanol Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple ex situ wet chemical transformation method of alkali treatment was proposed to prepare Ni(OH)2 nanostructured flowers with large specific surface areas from Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;74. The relationship between concentration of alkali and the structure properties of corresponding Ni(OH)2 was uncovered. As the results, the catalyst of Ni(OH)2&#8208;0.25 performed remarkably catalytic properties with lower potential, higher current density and excellent durability towards MOR among various samples.







Abstract
Post treatment of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is widely employed to develop efficient electrocatalysts with better catalytic properties. But the complex processes of post treatment generally led to the collapse of the original structures of MOFs, making the preservation of their pristine hierarchical porous structure a great challenge. Herein, we propose the strategy of alkali treatment of Ni&#8208;MOF to transform it into Ni(OH)2 with similar morphology and enhanced electrocatalytic properties for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). The structure and electrocatalytic properties of as&#8208;obtained Ni(OH)2 nanostructured flowers were seriously depended on the alkali concentrations. As the result, Ni(OH)2 obtained from Ni&#8208;MOF treated by 0.25&#8197;M NaOH (noted as Ni(OH)2&#8208;0.25) performs 1.5 and 2.5 times larger current density than those of Ni(OH)2&#8208;0.025 and Ni(OH)2&#8208;0.5 for MOR. Moreover, the electrocatalytic process and mechanism of MOR on the catalyst of Ni(OH)2&#8208;0.25 are also revealed. Hence, this ex situ conversion strategy of alkali treatment for Ni&#8208;MOF uncovered the transformation of MOFs in alkaline solution and develops robust electrocatalyst for practical application of methanol fuel cells.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of 11C&#8208;Labelled Primary Benzamides via Intermediate [11C]Aroyl Dimethylaminopyridinium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid and efficient method for radiolabeling of primary amides with the positron emitting radionuclide carbon&#8208;11 was developed. The method relies on intermediate electrophilic 11C&#8208;labelled aroyl dimethylaminopyridinium salts, prepared via carbonylative cross&#8208;coupling of aryl halides with [11C]carbon monoxide.







Abstract
Electrophilic 11C&#8208;labelled aroyl dimethylaminopyridinium salts, obtained by carbonylative cross&#8208;coupling of aryl halides with [11C]carbon monoxide, were prepared for the first time and shown to be valuable intermediates in the synthesis of primary [11C]benzamides. The methodology furnished a set of benzamide model compounds, including the two poly (ADP&#8208;ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors niraparib and veliparib, in moderate to excellent radiochemical yields. In addition to providing a convenient and practical route to primary [11C]benzamides, the current method paves the way for future application of [11C]aroyl dimethylaminopyridinium halide salts in positron emission tomography (PET) tracer synthesis.

         <title>Monitoring the Structure Evolution of Titanium Oxide Photocatalysts: From the Molecular Form via the Amorphous State to the Crystalline Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amorphous TixOy  with high surface area has attracted significant interest as photocatalyst with higher activity in ultraviolet (UV) light&#8208;induced water splitting applications compared to commercial nanocrystalline TiO2. Under photocatalytic operation conditions, the structure of the molecular titanium alkoxide precursor rearranges upon hydrolysis and leads to higher connectivity of the structure&#8208;building units. Structurally ordered domains with sizes smaller than 7 &#197; form larger aggregates. The experimental scattering data can be explained best with a structure model consisting of an anatase&#8208;like core and a distorted shell. Upon exposure with UV light, the white TixOy  suspension turns dark corresponding to the reduction of Ti  4+  to Ti  3+  as confirmed by electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). Heat&#8208;induced crystallisation was followed by  in situ  temperature&#8208;dependent total scattering experiments. First, ordering in the Ti&#8208;O environment takes place upon to 350 &#176;C. Above this temperature, the distorted anatase core starts to grow but the structure obtained at 400 &#176;C is still not fully ordered.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Gold Chemistry: From Simple Salts to Complexes for Regioselective C&#8722;H Bond Functionalization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The focusof this review is to highlight the advances in catalysis by gold complexes and salts on C&#8722;H bond activation chemistry. In particular, it covers the gold&#8208;catalyzed regioselective as well as site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H bond functionalization with emphasis on structural features, mechanisms and contributing factors of the relevant reactions. Depending on the nature of substrate, this review was categorized into six sections along with discussing applications in natural product synthesis.







Abstract
Gold coordinated to neutral phosphines (R3P), N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) or anionic ligands is catalytically active in functionalizing various C&#8722;H bonds with high selectivity. The sterics/electronic nature of the studied C&#8722;H bond, oxidation state of gold and stereoelectronic capacity of the coordinated auxiliary ligand are some of the associated selectivity factors in gold&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond functionalization reactions. Hence, in this review a comprehensive update about the action of different types of gold catalysts, from simple to sophisticated ones, on C&#8722;H bond reactions and their regiochemical outcome is disclosed. This review also highlights the catalytic applications of Au(I)&#8208; and Au(III)&#8208;species in creating new opportunities for the regio&#8208; and site&#8208;selective activation of challenging C&#8722;H bonds. Finally, it also intends to stress the potential applications in selective C&#8722;H bond activation associated with a variety of heterocycles recently described in the literature.

&lt;p&gt;Gold coordinated to neutral phosphines (R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P), &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) or anionic ligands is catalytically active in functionalizing various C&#8722;H bonds with high selectivity. The sterics/electronic nature of the studied C&#8722;H bond, oxidation state of gold and stereoelectronic capacity of the coordinated auxiliary ligand are some of the associated selectivity factors in gold-catalyzed C&#8722;H bond functionalization reactions. Hence, in this review a comprehensive update about the action of different types of gold catalysts, from simple to sophisticated ones, on C&#8722;H bond reactions and their regiochemical outcome is disclosed. This review also highlights the catalytic applications of Au(I)- and Au(III)-species in creating new opportunities for the regio- and site-selective activation of challenging C&#8722;H bonds. Finally, it also intends to stress the potential applications in selective C&#8722;H bond activation associated with a variety of heterocycles recently described in the literature.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Rediscovering Sulfinylamines as Reagents for Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent applications of N&#8208;sulfinylamines: In this Minireview, the use of N&#8208;sulfinylamines (R&#8722;N=S=O) in sulfoximine and sulfonimidamide synthesis, heterocycle formation and catalytic enantioselective oxidation of alkenes is covered. Brief discussions of their preparation, stability, properties and potential future applications are also included.







Abstract
Sulfinylamines (R&#8722;N=S=O), monoaza analogues of sulfur dioxide, have been known for well over a century, and their reactivity as sulfur electrophiles and in Diels&#8208;Alder reactions is well&#8208;established. However, they have only rarely been used in organic synthesis in recent decades despite the increasing prominence of compounds containing N=S=O functionality, such as sulfoximines and sulfonimidamides. This Minireview aims to bring wider visibility to the unique chemistry enabled by this class of compounds. We focus on advances from the last 10 years, including the first examples of their use in the one&#8208;pot syntheses of sulfoximines and sulfonimidamides. Also covered are the reactions of sulfinylamines with carbon&#8208;centred radicals, their use for formation of heterocycles through cycloadditions, and catalytic enantioselective allylic oxidation of alkenes via a hetero&#8208;ene reaction. These examples highlight the different reactivity modes of sulfinylamines and their underappreciated potential for forming molecules which contain high&#8208; or low&#8208;valent sulfur, or even no sulfur at all.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Mediated Stoichiometric Synthesis of Mono&#8208;, Bi&#8208;, and Bis&#8208;1,2&#8208;Azaborinines: 1&#8208;Rhoda&#8208;3,2&#8208;azaboroles as Reactive Precursors</title>

         <dc:description>
Boron&#8208;nitrogen analogs of metallacyclopentadienes in the form of 1&#8208;rhoda&#8208;3,2&#8208;azaboroles (see Figure) are shown to be suitable precursors for the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;azaborinines. Comparisons with 1,2&#8208;azaborete rhodium complexes demonstrate their superior reactivity towards alkynes, allowing to expand the range of 1,2&#8208;azaborinines. A series of multiply substituted 1,2&#8208;azaborinines, including a phenylene&#8208;bridged derivative and rare bicyclic derivatives composed of two 1,2&#8208;azaborinine rings linked by a single bond, are reported.







Abstract
A series of highly substituted 1,2&#8208;azaborinines, including a phenylene&#8208;bridged bis&#8208;1,2&#8208;azaborinine, was synthesized from the reaction of 1,2&#8208;azaborete rhodium complexes with variously substituted alkynes. 1&#8208;Rhoda&#8208;3,2&#8208;azaborole complexes, which are accessible by phosphine addition to the corresponding 1,2&#8208;azaborete complexes, were also found to be suitable precursors for the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;azaborinines and readily reacted with alkynyl&#8208;substituted 1,2&#8208;azaborinines to generate new regioisomers of bi&#8208;1,2&#8208;azaborinines, which feature directly connected aromatic rings. Their molecular structures, which can be viewed as boron&#8208;nitrogen isosteres of biphenyls, show nearly perpendicular 1,2&#8208;azaborinine rings. The new method using rhodacycles instead of 1,2&#8208;azaborete complexes as precursors is shown to be more effective, allowing the synthesis of a wider range of 1,2&#8208;azaborinines.

         <title>Phosphate&#8208;Based Self&#8208;Immolative Linkers for Tunable Double Cargo Release</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphorus&#8208;based self&#8208;immolative (SI) linkers offer a wide range of applications, such as smart materials and drug delivery systems. Phosphorus SI linkers are ideal candidates for double cargo delivery platforms because they have a higher valency than carbon. Accordingly, we designed a series of substituted phosphate linkers for releasing two phenolic cargos through SI followed by chemical hydrolysis. Suitable modifications of the lactate spacer increased the cargo release rate significantly, from 1 day to 2 hours or 5 minutes, as shown for linkers containing  p  &#8208;fluoro phenol. In turn, double cargo linkers bearing  p  &#8208;methyl phenol released their cargo more slowly (4 days, 4 hours, and 15 minutes, respectively) than their  p  &#8208;fluoro analogues. The  &#945;  &#8208;hydroxyisobutyrate linker released both cargos in 25 minutes. Our study expands the current portfolio of SI constructs by providing a double cargo delivery option, which is crucial to develop universal SI platforms.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatiotemporal Resolved Live Cell Membrane Tracking through&#160;Photo&#8208;click Reactions Enriched in Lipid Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A set of photo&#8208;switchable monopeptides derived from  cis  &#8208;&#946;&#8208;dibenzodiazocine&#8208;  l  &#8208;alanine (  cis  &#8208;DBDAA) have been designed and synthesized, which are capable of photo&#8208;click reacting with diaryltetrazoles or diarylsydnones in a hydrophobic phospholipid bilayer environment. The DBDAA monopeptides include both a hydrophobic tail on  C  &#8208;terminal, providing high affinity toward lipid membrane, and a modularized functional moiety on N&#8208;terminal, enabling rapid optimization of the self&#8208;assembly strength to form multifunctional supramolecules. With the  cis  &#8208;DBDAA monopeptides photo&#8208;switched into  trans  &#8208;configuration, we were able to disrupt the supramolecular assembly through an efficient photo&#8208;click reaction across the lipid bilayer of liposomes.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A set of photo-switchable monopeptides derived from  cis  -&#946;-dibenzodiazocine-  l  -alanine (  cis  -DBDAA) have been designed and synthesized, which are capable of photo-click reacting with diaryltetrazoles or diarylsydnones in a hydrophobic phospholipid bilayer environment. The DBDAA monopeptides include both a hydrophobic tail on  C  -terminal, providing high affinity toward lipid membrane, and a modularized functional moiety on N-terminal, enabling rapid optimization of the self-assembly strength to form multifunctional supramolecules. With the  cis  -DBDAA monopeptides photo-switched into  trans  -configuration, we were able to disrupt the supramolecular assembly through an efficient photo-click reaction across the lipid bilayer of liposomes. We reveal that the performance of the photo-click reactions between the monopeptides and photo-generated nitrile imine intermediates is significantly enhanced by enrichment of both reactants in the hydrophobic membrane lamel of liposomes. Enrichment of the DBDAA monopeptide in lipid phase serves as a convenient method to introduce bioorthogonal chemical handles on live cell membranes, which enables fluorescence labelling of single cell's membrane with high spatiotemporal resolution to facilitate the studies on cell membrane dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoresponsive Binding Dynamics in High&#8208;Affinity Cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;Dithienylethene Host&#8208;Guest Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinetic studies on host&#8208;guest systems based on cucurbit[8]uril and dithienylethene (DTE) photoswitches shows that the more tightly bound closed DTE isomers are kinetically more stable that their open counterparts. This allows for the modulation of their binding dynamics with light stimulus constituting an attractive tool for the development of out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium supramolecular systems.







Abstract
The use of external stimuli to control the binding kinetics in supramolecular systems is of critical importance for the development of advanced molecular machines and devices. In this work, a study focused on the kinetics of a water&#8208;soluble host&#8208;guest system based on cucurbit[8]uril and two dithienylethene (DTE) photoswitches is reported. It is shown that for the DTE guest comprising two anionic sulfonate side arms appended to pyridinium moieties, the formation/dissociation of the pseudorotaxane structures is slowed down by more than 100000&#8208;fold with respect to its bipyridinium analogue. The decrease in ingression rate leads to the emergence of a competitive metastable product with the open DTE isomer that has an important influence in the overall binding kinetics. Moreover, the host&#8208;guest dissociation kinetics is demonstrated to be approximately 100&#8208;fold slower for the closed DTE isomer (t1/2=107&#8197;h vs. t1/2=1.2&#8197;h for the open isomer) allowing control over the dissociation rate with light.

         <title>Multifunctional Heterometallic IrIII&#8722;AuI Probes as Promising Anticancer and Antiangiogenic Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A golden opportunity: Cytotoxic and green&#8208;emissive orthometallated IrIII&#8208;AuI complexes have been synthesised. For some of the complexes, trafficking between the lysosomes and mitochondria in A549 cells can be suggested. Disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential was observed as well as an apoptotic cell death mechanism. Angiogenic assays reveal that the complexes have good prospects as antimetastatic agents.







Abstract
A new class of emissive cyclometallated IrIII&#8722;AuI complexes with a bis(diphenylphosphino) methanide bridging ligand was successfully synthesised from the diphosphino complex [Ir(N^C)2(dppm)]+ (1). The different gold ancillary ligand, a triphenylphosphine (2), a chloride (3) or a thiocytosine (4) did not reveal any significant effect on the photophysical properties, which are mainly due to metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer (3MLCT) transitions based on IrIII. However, the AuI fragment, along with the ancillary ligand, seemed crucial for the bioactivity in A549 lung carcinoma cells versus endothelial cells. Both cell types display variable sensitivities to the complexes (IC50=0.6&#8211;3.5&#8197;&#956;M). The apoptotic pathway is activated in all cases, and paraptotic cell death seems to take place at initial stages in A549 cells. Species 2&#8211;4 showed at least dual lysosomal and mitochondrial biodistribution in A549 cells, with an initial lysosomal localisation and a possible trafficking process between both organelles with time. The bimetallic IrIII&#8722;AuI complexes disrupted the mitochondrial transmembrane potential in A549 cells and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) inhibition in comparison with that displayed by the monometallic complex 1. Angiogenic activity assays performed in endothelial cells revealed the promising antimetastatic potential of 1, 2 and 4.

         <title>First Total Synthesis of Phytoprostanes with Prostaglandin&#8208;Like Configuration, Evidence for Their Formation in Edible Vegetable Oils and Orienting Study of Their Biological Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PhytoP against PhytoG: The first total synthesis of phytoglandins (PhytoG), phytoprostanes (PhytoP) with prostaglandin configuration was accomplished. They are indeed metabolites of &#945;&#8208;linolenic acid and form at sizeable levels during aging of edible vegetable oils as demonstrated in a UHPLC&#8208;MS/MS study.







Abstract
Phytoprostanes (PhytoP) are natural products, which form in plants under oxidative stress conditions from &#945;&#8208;linolenic acid. However, their epimers with relative prostaglandin configuration termed phytoglandins (PhytoG) have never been detected in Nature, likely because of the lack of synthetic reference material. Here, the first asymmetric total synthesis of such compounds, namely of PhytoGF1&#945; (9&#8208;epi&#8208;16&#8208;F1t&#8208;PhytoP) and its diastereomer ent&#8208;16&#8208;epi&#8208;PhytoGF1&#945; (ent&#8208;9,16&#8208;diepi&#8208;16&#8208;F1t&#8208;PhytoP), has been accomplished. The synthetic strategy is based on radical anion oxidative cyclization, copper(I)&#8208;mediated alkyl&#8208;alkyl coupling and enantioselective reduction reactions. A UHPLC&#8208;MS/MS study using the synthesized compounds as standards indicates PhytoG formation at significant levels during autoxidation of &#945;&#8208;linolenic acid in edible vegetable oils. Initial testing of synthetic PhytoGs together with F1&#8208;PhytoP and 15&#8208;F2t&#8208;IsoP derivatives for potential interactions with the PGF2&#945; (FP) receptor did not reveal significant activity. The notion that PUFA&#8208;derived oxidatively formed cyclic metabolites with prostaglandin configuration do not form to a significant extent in biological or food matrices has to be corrected. Strong evidence is provided that oxidatively formed PhytoG metabolites may be ingested with plant&#8208;derived food, which necessitates further investigation of their biological profile.

         <title>Advanced Acceptor&#8208;Substituted S,N&#8208;Heteropentacenes for Application in Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functionalized S,N&#8208;heteropentacenes SN5&#8217; comprising annulated thiophene and pyrrole rings with the heteroatom sequence SSNSS in the ladder&#8208;type backbone were developed with systematically varied structural motifs. Tunable frontier orbital energies allowed their application either as donor or as nonfullerenic acceptor in solution&#8208;processed bulk&#8208;heterojunction solar cells.







Abstract
Ambifunctional heterpentacenes with the heteroatom sequence SSNSS in the ladder&#8208;type backbone were used either as donor or as nonfullerenic acceptor in solution&#8208;processed bulk&#8208;heterojunction solar cells. Different acceptor moieties and side chains were inserted. Synthesis and characterization of the systematically varied structural motifs provided insight in structure&#8208;property relationships. Moreover, a dimeric heteroacene was synthesized, and the optoelectronic properties were compared to those of its monomeric counterpart.

         <title>Spotlight on the Effect of Electrolyte Composition on the Potential of Maximum Entropy. Supporting Electrolytes are not Always Inert</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, the influence of the electrolyte pH, presence of alkali metal cations (Na+, K+), and O2 on the interfacial water structure of polycrystalline Au electrodes have been experimentally studied in detail. The potential of maximum entropy (PME) was determined by the laser&#8208;induced current transient (LICT) technique. Our results demonstrate that increasing the electrolyte pH and introducing O2 shift the PME to more positive potentials. Interestingly, the PME exhibits a higher sensitivity to the pH change in the presence of K+ than Na+. Altering the pH of K2SO4 solution from 4 to 6 can cause a drastic shift of the PME. These findings reveal that e.g. K2SO4 and Na2SO4 cannot be considered as equal supporting electrolytes: it is not a viable assumption. This can likely be extrapolated to other common &#8220;inert&#8221; supporting electrolytes. Beyond that, the knowledge about the near&#8208;ideal electrolyte composition can be used to optimize electrochemical devices such as electrolyzers, fuel cells, batteries, and supercapacitors.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyrroloquinoline Quinone Aza&#8208;Crown Ether Complexes as Biomimetics for Lanthanide and Calcium Dependent Alcohol Dehydrogenases**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) based model system was used for the investigation of different factors that may have an impact on the oxidation reaction in the active sites of alcohol dehydrogenase enzymes. Using various metal salts, the influence of ion size and charge, as well as counterions was investigated. The study involves NMR and EPR analysis as well as advanced mass spectrometry techniques.







Abstract
Understanding the role of metal ions in biology can lead to the development of new catalysts for several industrially important transformations. Lanthanides are the most recent group of metal ions that have been shown to be important in biology, that is, in quinone&#8208;dependent methanol dehydrogenases (MDH). Here we evaluate a literature&#8208;known pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) and 1&#8208;aza&#8208;15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 based ligand platform as scaffold for Ca2+, Ba2+, La3+ and Lu3+ biomimetics of MDH and we evaluate the importance of ligand design, charge, size, counterions and base for the alcohol oxidation reaction using NMR spectroscopy. In addition, we report a new straightforward synthetic route (3 steps instead of 11 and 33&#8201;% instead of 0.6&#8201;% yield) for biomimetic ligands based on PQQ. We show that when studying biomimetics for MDH, larger metal ions and those with lower charge in this case promote the dehydrogenation reaction more effectively and that this is likely an effect of the ligand design which must be considered when studying biomimetics. To gain more information on the structures and impact of counterions of the complexes, we performed collision induced dissociation (CID) experiments and observe that the nitrates are more tightly bound than the triflates. To resolve the structure of the complexes in the gas phase we combined DFT&#8208;calculations and ion mobility measurements (IMS). Furthermore, we characterized the obtained complexes and reaction mixtures using Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and show the presence of a small amount of quinone&#8208;based radical.

         <title>Fe(II) metallohelices stabilize DNA G&#8208;quadruplexes and down&#8208;regulate expression of G&#8208;quadruplex regulated oncogenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) were identified within the promoter regions of many proto&#8208;oncogenes. Thus, G4s represent attractive targets for cancer therapy and the design and development of new drugs as G4 binders is a very active field of medicinal chemistry. Here, we employed methods of molecular biophysics and biology to investigate the interaction of chiral metallohelices with a series of four DNA G4s (  hTelo  ,  c&#8208;myc  ,  c&#8208;kit1  ,  c&#8208;kit2  ) that are formed by the human telomeric sequence (  hTelo  ) and in the promoter regions of  c&#8208;MYC  and  c&#8208;KIT  proto&#8208;oncogenes. We show that the investigated water&#8208;compatible optically pure metallohelices made by self&#8208;assembly of simple nonpeptidic organic components around Fe(II) ions, which exhibit bioactivity emulating the natural systems, bind with high affinity to G4 DNA and much lower affinity towards duplex DNA. Notably, both enantiomers of metallohelix containing  m  &#8208;xylenyl bridge (  5b  ) were found to be effective inhibitors of primer elongation catalyzed by  Taq  DNA polymerase by stabilizing G4 structures formed in the template strands containing  c&#8208;myc  and  c&#8208;kit2  G4&#8208;forming sequences. Moreover, both enantiomers of  5b  down&#8208;regulated the expression of  c&#8208;MYC  and  c&#8208;KIT  oncogenes in human embryonic kidney cells at mRNA and protein levels. As metallohelices also bind alternative nucleic acid structures, they hold promise as potential multi&#8208;targeted drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of 3&#8208;Substituted 3&#8208;Amino&#8208;2&#8208;oxindoles by Amination with Anilines</title>

         <dc:description>
A direct and efficient asymmetric synthesis of phenylamino&#8208;3&#8208;indolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones was realized by developing a chiral nickel complex catalytic system for the amination of 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;3&#8208;substituted oxindoles with anilines. A wide range of 3&#8208;aminooxindoles with 3&#8208;alkyl or 3&#8208;aryl substitution, including key intermediates of bioactive molecules, was created in excellent yield and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
A chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide&#8208;nickel(II) complex&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric amination of 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;3&#8208;substituted oxindoles with anilines has been developed. A series of alkyl or aryl 3&#8208;amino&#8208;indolinones with quaternary stereocenters were obtained in high yields with excellent ee values in one step (up to 99&#8201;% yield, up to 96&#8201;% ee). The method provided a ready route to optically active intermediates of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;oxindole&#8208;based bioactive compounds. Moreover, a possible transition&#8208;state model is proposed so as to elucidate the origin of the chirality based on the X&#8208;ray crystal structure of the catalyst and the adduct.

         <title>Synthesis of Difluoroglycine Derivatives from Amines, Difluorocarbene, and CO2: Computational Design, Scope, and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In theory and in practice: A three&#8208;component reaction of amine, difluorocarbene, and CO2 to form an &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoroglycine core was predicted by the artificial force&#8208;induced reaction method and successfully demonstrated in experiment with a broad range of tert&#8208;amines and heteroaromatic compounds. Moreover, the products can be used for the generation of difluorocarbene without any additives, difluoroalkylation under photoredox conditions, and synthesis of metal&#8208;NHC complexes.







Abstract
A three&#8208;component reaction (3CR) for the synthesis of difluoroglycine derivatives has been achieved by using amines, difluorocarbene (generated in&#8197;situ), and the abundant, inexpensive, and nontoxic C1 source CO2. Various tert&#8208;amines and pyridine, (iso)quinoline, imidazole, thiazole, and pyrazole derivatives were incorporated, and the corresponding products were isolated in solid form without purification by column chromatography on silica gel. Detailed reaction profiles of the 3CR were obtained from computational analysis using DFT calculations, and the results critically suggest that simple ammonia is not applicable to this reaction. In addition, as strongly supported by computational predictions, a new reagent that can generate difluorocarbene at 0&#8201;&#176;C without any additives was discovered. Finally, radical substitution reactions of the obtained difluoroglycine derivatives under photoredox conditions, as well as a synthetic application as an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand are shown.

         <dc:description>
Copper oxide subnanoparticles with sizes of &#8764;1&#8197;nm, which were prepared using a dendritic phenylazomethine template, exhibit the lowest CuII&#8594;CuI reduction temperature directly observed by in situ XAFS measurements during temperature&#8208;programmed reduction (TPR) with H2. The CuO particles with low atomicity easily release oxygen atoms because of their surface&#8208;strained structure and the unprecedented elongation of their Cu&#8722;O bonds. More information can be found in the Communication by M. Tanabe, K. Yamamoto et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100508).

         <title>Stereoretentive N&#8208;Arylation of Amino Acid Esters with Cyclohexanones Utilizing a Continuous&#8208;Flow System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereoretentive N&#8208;arylation of chiral amino acid esters with cyclohexanones as halogen&#8208;free aryl sources was performed under continuous&#8208;flow conditions. The designed flow system, comprising a coil reactor and a packed&#8208;bed reactor containing a Pd(OH)2/C catalyst, efficiently afforded the desired N&#8208;arylated amino acid products without significant racemization, accompanied by only small amounts of easily removable co&#8208;products. This method allowed for the continuous synthesis of the desired product in very high yield and enantiopurity for at least 3&#8197;days.







Abstract
The N&#8208;arylation of chiral amino acid esters with minimal racemization is a challenging transformation because of the sensitivity of the &#945;&#8208;stereocenter. A versatile synthetic method was developed to prepare N&#8208;arylated amino acid esters using cyclohexanones as aryl sources under continuous&#8208;flow conditions. The designed flow system, which consists of a coil reactor and a packed&#8208;bed reactor containing a Pd(OH)2/C catalyst, efficiently afforded the desired N&#8208;arylated amino acids without significant racemization, accompanied by only small amounts of easily removable co&#8208;products (i.&#8201;e., H2O and alkanes). The efficiency and robustness of this method allowed for the continuous synthesis of the desired product in very high yield and enantiopurity with high space&#8208;time yield (74.1&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and turnover frequency (5.9&#8197;h&#8722;1) for at least 3&#8197;days.

         <title>Activation of a Copper Biscarbene Mechano&#8208;Catalyst Using Single&#8208;Molecule Force Spectroscopy Supported by Quantum Chemical Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;molecule force spectroscopy was used to activate a copper biscarbene (NHC) mechano&#8208;catalyst intended for self&#8208;healing materials. By using a safety line, bypassing the mechanophore, we were able to pinpoint the dissociation of the investigated bond and determine rupture forces of the Cu&#8722;NHC bond to range from 1.6 to 2.6&#8197;nN at room temperature in dimethyl sulfoxide. Quantum chemical calculations support the experimental results. More information can be found in the Full Paper by W.&#8197;H.&#8197;Binder, M.&#8197;K.&#8197;Beyer et&#8197;al.

         <title>Take your Positions and Shine: Effects of Positioning Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Luminophores within Sequence&#8208;Defined Macromolecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sequence&#8208;defined oligo(amidoamines) are employed to develop supramolecular ligands with AIE properties for detection of binding. Special focus is devoted to varying the position of the AIE luminophore within the scaffold and in relation to the supramolecular binding motif. A strong influence of the position on the resulting AIE properties is shown and evaluated for the ligand binding to various natural and synthetic polyanions.







Abstract
A luminophore with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) is employed for the conjugation onto supramolecular ligands to allow for detection of ligand binding. Supramolecular ligands are based on the combination of sequence&#8208;defined oligo(amidoamine) scaffolds and guanidiniocarbonyl&#8208;pyrrole (GCP) as binding motif. We hypothesize that AIE properties are strongly affected by positioning of the luminophore within the ligand scaffold. Therefore, we systematically investigate the effects placing the AIE luminophore at different positions within the overall construct, for example, in the main or side chain of the olig(amidoamine). Indeed, we can show that the position within the ligand structure strongly affects AIE, both for the ligand itself as well as when applying the ligand for the detection of different biological and synthetic polyanions.

         <title>Mn3&#8722;xFexO4 Hollow Nanostructures for High&#8208;Performance Asymmetric Supercapacitor Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large amount of Fe2+ was induced into Mn3O4 nanoparticles through effective electrodisplacement reaction to synthesize Mn3&#8722;xFeXO4 hollow nanostructures. By changing the addition of Fe2+, elemental compositions and structures of Mn3&#8722;xFexO4 could be well adjusted. The remarkable performance of Mn3&#8722;xFexO4 hollow nanostructures in pseudocapacitor applications is demonstrated. Compared with the original Mn3O4, the electrochemical performance of the obtained porous Mn3&#8722;xFexO4 nanostructure is significantly improved.







Abstract
Design of hollow nanostructure and controllable phase of mixed metal oxides for improving performance in supercapacitor applications is highly desirable. Here we demonstrate the rational design and synthesis of Mn3&#8722;xFexO4 hollow nanostructures for supercapacitor applications. Owing to high porosity and the specific surface area that provides more active sites for electrochemical reactions, the electrochemical performance of Mn3&#8722;xFexO4 hollow nanostructure substantially enhanced comparing with pristine Mn3O4. Particularly, in 1.0&#8197;M KOH electrolyte, Mn0.16Fe2.84O4 with a typical diameter of 20&#8197;nm exhibits excellent specific capacitance of 2675, 2320, 1662, 987&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at current densities of 1, 2, 5, 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively, which is significantly superior to those of other transition metal oxides. Besides, an asymmetric supercapacitor is assembled by using Mn0.16Fe2.84O4 and activated carbon as a positive and a negative electrode, respectively. Electrochemical results indicate a high energy density of 42&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 0.75&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1, which makes this hollow nanostructure a highly promising electrode for achieving high&#8208;performance next&#8208;generation supercapacitors.

         <title>A Rapid and Mild Sulfation Strategy Reveals Conformational Preferences in Therapeutically Relevant Sulfated Xylooligosaccharides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Preparation of the largest homogeneous persulfated xylooligomers reported to date is facilitated by a rapid and quantitative one&#8208;pot sulfation protocol based on the in&#8197;situ generation of SO3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;DMF. The synthesized oligosaccharide standards afforded unique structural insights into persulfated xylooligomers, including a 1C4 conformational preference for all associated non&#8208;reducing pyranosyl residues. Application of the method to the synthesis of a sulfated pyridyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;xylotriose also enabled identification of a pyridinium contaminant in a commercial sample of pentosan polysulfate, a widely&#8208;deployed sulfated xylooligosaccharide&#8208;based therapy.







Abstract
Although sulfated xylooligosaccharides are promising therapeutic leads for a multitude of afflictions, the structural complexity and heterogeneity of commercially deployed forms (e.&#8201;g. Pentosan polysulfate 1) complicates their path to further clinical development. We describe herein the synthesis of the largest homogeneous persulfated xylooligomers prepared to date, comprising up to eight xylose residues, as standards for biological studies. Near quantitative sulfation was accomplished using a remarkably mild and operationally simple protocol which avoids the need for high temperatures and a large excess of the sulfating reagent. Moreover, the sulfated xylooligomer standards so obtained enabled definitive identification of a pyridinium contaminant in a sample of a commercially prepared Pentosan drug and provided significant insights into the conformational preferences of the constituent persulfated monosaccharide residues. As the spatial distribution of sulfates is a key determinant of the binding of sulfated oligosaccharides to endogenous targets, these findings have broad implications for the advancement of Pentosan&#8208;based treatments.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Triggered Structural Dynamics of Non&#8208;Coordinating Guest Moieties in a Fluorescent Actinide Polyrotaxane Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An actinide polyrotaxane compound URCP1 with characteristic green fluorescence from uranyl centers was prepared through the utilization of an end&#8208;cutting pseudorotaxane precursor with only the cucurbit[6]uril (CB[6]) macrocyclic components acting as linking struts. The non&#8208;coordinating guest motif in URCP1 has increased freedom and structural flexibility, and displays intriguing temperature&#8208;triggered dynamic conformational variations inside the cavity of CB[6]. More information can be found in the Full Paper by L. Mei et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100614).

         <title>Endohedral Mixed Aggregates: Sodium Alkoxide Cages with Organic or Inorganic Central Anions and Variable Hull</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium alkoxide with a pinch of salt: The in&#8197;situ release of organic or inorganic anions from silyl compounds allows for their encapsulation in a sodium alkoxide shell. These spherical mixed aggregates incorporate anions ranging from the organic and basic methyl anion, halides, and pseudo&#8208;halides to the nitrate anion. In this form, such anions can be studied as isolated entities unaffected by the influence of strongly coordinating solvents.







Abstract
Alkali metal alkoxides are widely used in chemistry due to their Br&#248;nsted basic and nucleophilic properties. Potassium alkoxides assist alkyllithium in the metalation of hydrocarbons in Lochmann&#8208;Schlosser&#8208;bases. Both compounds form mixed aggregates, which enhance the thermal stability, solubility, and the basic reactivity of these mixtures. A very unusual spherical mixed alkoxy aggregate was discovered by Gr&#252;tzmacher et&#8197;al., where a central dihydrogen phosphide anion is surrounded by a highly dynamic shell of thirteen sodium atoms and a hull of twelve tert&#8208;butoxide groups. This structural motif can be reproduced by a reaction of trimethylsilyl compounds of methane, halogens, or pseudo&#8208;halogens with excess sodium tert&#8208;butoxide. A nucleophilic substitution releases the corresponding anion, which is then encapsulated by the sodium alkoxide units. The compounds are soluble in hydrocarbon solvents, enabling studies of solutions by high&#8208;resolution NMR spectroscopy and IR/Raman studies of the crystalline materials.

         <title>Coexistence of Two Different Distorted Octahedral [MnF6]3&#8722; Sites in K3[MnF6]: Manifestation in Spectroscopy and Magnetism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Distorted octahedra: Using a high&#8208;temperature/high&#8208;pressure synthesis, K3[MnF6] with two different kinds of distorted [MnF6]3&#8722; octahedra &#8211; a pseudo&#8208;rhombic and an pseudo&#8208;tetragonally elongated distorted octahedron &#8211; was structurally, magnetically and spectroscopically characterized. A theoretical interpretation of the electronic structure and molecular geometry is given.







Abstract
As a consequence of the static Jahn&#8208;Teller effect of the 5E ground state of MnIII in cubic structures with octahedral parent geometries, their octahedral coordination spheres become distorted. In the case of six fluorido ligands, [MnF6]3&#8722; anions with two longer and four shorter Mn&#8722;F bonds making elongated octahedra are usually observed. Herein, we report the synthesis of the compound K3[MnF6] through a high&#8208;temperature approach and its crystallization by a high&#8208;pressure/high&#8208;temperature route. The main structural motifs are two quasi&#8208;isolated, octahedron&#8208;like [MnF6]3&#8722; anions of quite different nature compared to that met in ideal octahedral MnIII Jahn&#8208;Teller systems. Owing to the internal electric field of Ci symmetry dominated by the next&#8208;neighbour K+ ions acting on the MnIII sites, both sites, the pseudo&#8208;rhombic (site 1) and the pseudo&#8208;tetragonally elongated (site 2) [MnF6]3&#8722; anions are present in K3[MnF6]. The compound was characterized by single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, and magnetometry as well as by FTIR, Raman, and ligand field spectroscopy. A theoretical interpretation of the electronic structure and molecular geometry of the two Mn sites in the lattice is given by using a vibronic coupling model with parameters adjusted from multireference ab&#8208;initio cluster calculations.

         <title>Saccharified Uranyl Ions: Self&#8208;Assembly of UO22+ into Trinuclear Anionic Complexes by the Coordination of Glucosamine&#8208;Derived Schiff Bases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Saccharify your uranyl ions! The cover art shows a cotton candy machine at a country fair. By feeding uranyl ions and a sugar&#8208;based ligand into it, a trinuclear uranyl complex is formed, illustrated as cotton candy. The complex shows the coordination motive of three uranyl ions in the core, bridged by a central &#956;3&#8208;oxo ligand, surrounded by the three sugar ligands. This work presents spectroscopic investigations into the complex formation and its self&#8208;assembly. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J.&#8197;J. Weigand et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100546).

         <title>The Construction of DNA Logic Gates Restricted in Live Cells Based on Structure Programmability and Aptamer&#8208;cell Affinity of G&#8208;quadruplex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA computation is considered as one fascinating alternative to silicon&#8208;based computers, which has evoked substantial attention and gained rapid advancements. Besides realizing versatile functions, implementing spatiotemporal control of logic operations, especially in cellular level, is also of great significance to the development of DNA computation. However, developing simple and efficient methods to restrict DNA logic gates performing in live cells is still a challenge. In this work, we designed a series of DNA logic gates by taking full advantage of the diversity and programmability of G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) structure. More importantly, by further utilizing the high affinity and specific endocytosis of cells to aptamer G4, we have achieved in realizing an  INHIBIT  logic gate whose operational site is precisely restricted in specific live cells. The design strategy may have great potential in the field of molecular computation and smart bio&#8208;applications.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Mechanism of Au&#8208;Catalyzed Enynamide&#8208;yne Dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions: An Experimental and Computational Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Following the pattern: The Au&#8208;catalyzed formal dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of enynamide&#8208;yne derivatives was shown experimentally and computationally to proceed according to a dual gold&#8208;catalyzed mechanism. The reaction proceeded in 3 stages: initial formation of a &#963;,&#960;&#8208;digold complex followed by cyclization to produce a gem&#8208;diaurated aryl complex and finally a catalyst transfer. The concerted or stepwise nature of the cyclization event was found to depend on the substitution pattern of the ynamide moiety.







Abstract
Gold&#8208;catalyzed dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reactions of ynamide derivatives allow efficient access to a variety of N&#8208;containing aromatic heterocycles. A dual gold catalysis mechanism was postulated for transformations involving the formation of C&#8722;C bonds by reaction between a terminal alkyne and an enynamide fragment. In this article, complete experimental and computational investigations into the mechanism of such a transformation are reported. Support for a dual gold catalysis was found and it was shown that the concerted or stepwise nature of the cyclization event depends on the substitution of the ynamide moiety. The reaction was found to proceed in three stages: 1)&#8197;formation of a &#963;,&#960;&#8208;digold complex from the terminal alkyne, 2)&#8197;cyclization to produce a gem&#8208;diaurated aryl complex, and 3)&#8197;catalyst transfer to free the product and regenerate the &#963;,&#960;&#8208;digold complex.

         <title>Elucidating the Dual Mode of Action of Dipeptidyl Enoates in the Inhibition of Rhodesain Cysteine Proteases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A QM/MM computational study of two possible inhibition mechanisms of rhodesain cysteine protease by the dipeptidyl enoate Cbz&#8208;Phe&#8208;Leu&#8208;CH=CH&#8722;CO2C2H5 confirms the dual mode of action of this family of inhibitors. Efforts focused on increasing the interaction with the residues of the S2 pocket of rhodesain could be used as a guide to design new dual inhibitors with greater selectivity and affinity.







Abstract
A computational study of the two possible inhibition mechanisms of rhodesain cysteine protease by the dipeptidyl enoate Cbz&#8208;Phe&#8208;Leu&#8208;CH=CH&#8722;CO2C2H5 has been carried out by means of molecular dynamics simulations with hybrid QM/MM potentials. The low free energy barriers confirm that the Cys25 residue can attack both C&#946; and C1 atoms of the inhibitor, confirming a dual mode of action in the inhibition of the rhodesain by enoates. According to the results, the inhibition process through the Cys25 attack on the C&#946; atom of the inhibitor is an exergonic and irreversible process, while the inhibition process when Cys25 attacks on the C1 atom of the inhibitor is and exergonic but reversible process. The interactions between the inhibitor and rhodesain suggest that P2 is the most important fragment to consider in the design of new efficient inhibitors of rhodesain. These results may be useful for the design of new inhibitors of rhodesain and other related cysteine proteases based on dipeptidyl enoates scaffolds.

         <title>Quantification and Prediction of Imine Formation Kinetics in Aqueous Solution by Microfluidic NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The imine formation in aqueous solution that was finished within several minutes by microfluidic NMR spectroscopy was investigated. The forward rate constants k+ were quantified by an empirical equation containing three independent parameters: reactivity parameters of aldehydes (SE, E) and amines (N). These results allow the prediction of the unknown forward rate constant k+ and rational design of two reaction networks exhibiting kinetic selectivity.







Abstract
Quantitatively predicting the reactivity of dynamic covalent reaction is essential to understand and rationally design complex structures and reaction networks. Herein, the reactivity of aldehydes and amines in various rapid imine formation in aqueous solution by microfluidic NMR spectroscopy was quantified. Investigation of reaction kinetics allowed to quantify the forward rate constants k+ by an empirical equation, of which three independent parameters were introduced as reactivity parameters of aldehydes (SE, E) and amines (N). Furthermore, these reactivity parameters were successfully used to predict the unknown forward rate constants of imine formation. Finally, two competitive reaction networks were rationally designed based on the proposed reactivity parameters. Our work has demonstrated the capability of microfluidic NMR spectroscopy in quantifying the kinetics of label&#8208;free chemical reactions, especially rapid reactions that are complete in minutes.

Enantioselective total synthesis of the putative biosynthetic intermediate ambruticin&#8197;J (@retaylor61 @UNDresearch)







Abstract
The family of anti&#8208;fungal natural products known as the ambruticins are structurally distinguished by a pair of pyran rings adorning a divinylcyclopropane core. Previous characterization of their biosynthesis, including the expression of a genetically modified producing organism, revealed that the polyketide synthase pathway proceeds via a diol intermediate, known as ambruticin&#8197;J. Herein, we report the first enantioselective total synthesis of the putative PKS product, ambruticin&#8197;J, according to a triply convergent synthetic route featuring a Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling and a Julia&#8208;Kocienski olefination for fragment assembly. This synthesis takes advantage of synthetic methodology previously developed by our laboratory for the stereoselective generation of the trisubstituted cyclopropyl linchpin.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Intercalative Platinum Anticancer Complexes Photoactivated by Visible Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Green to go: Photoactive all&#8208;trans diazido PtIV complexes with an axial 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide ligand that can pre&#8208;intercalate into DNA have been synthesised. They can be photoactivated with visible light to generate PtII DNA interstrand crosslinks and cytotoxic ROS, and are thus promising photo&#8208;chemotherapeutic agents. Notably, a 4&#8208;NMe2 substituent red&#8208;shifted absorption of the naphthalimide ring, giving rise to its green&#8208;light photo&#8208;cytotoxicity.







Abstract
Photoactivatable agents offer the prospect of highly selective cancer therapy with low side effects and novel mechanisms of action that can combat current drug resistance. 1,8&#8208;Naphthalimides with their extended &#960; system can behave as light&#8208;harvesting groups, fluorescent probes and DNA intercalators. We conjugated N&#8208;(carboxymethyl)&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide (gly&#8208;R&#8208;Nap) with an R substituent on the naphthyl group to photoactive diazido PtIV complexes to form t,t,t&#8208;[Pt(py)2(N3)2(OH)(gly&#8208;R&#8208;Nap)], R=H (1), 3&#8208;NO2 (2) or 4&#8208;NMe2 (3). They show enhanced photo&#8208;oxidation, cellular accumulation and promising photo&#8208;cytotoxicity in human A2780 ovarian, A549 lung and PC3 prostate cancer cells with visible light activation, and low dark cytotoxicity. Complexes 1 and 2 exhibit pre&#8208;intercalation into DNA, resulting in enhanced photo&#8208;induced DNA crosslinking. Complex 3 has a red&#8208;shifted absorption band at 450&#8197;nm, allowing photoactivation and photo&#8208;cytotoxicity with green light.

         <title>A Cytotoxic Bis(1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;5&#8208;ylidene)carbazolide Gold(III) Complex Targets DNA by Partial Intercalation</title>

A challenging synthesis yields a bis(carbene) AuI&#8208;CNC pincer precursor complex that may be oxidized to a remarkably redox&#8208;stable [AuIII(CNC)Cl]+ cation which shows significant cytotoxicity towards a breast cancer cell line. Electrophoresis, viscometry, and spectroscopic data suggest the likely mode of interaction of the compound with DNA involves partial intercalation, enabling it to potentially target both conventional and unconventional DNA species such as three&#8208;way junctions (in silico data). More information can be found in the Full Paper by O.&#8197;Q. Munro, D.&#8197;I. Bezuidenhout, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100598).

         <title>Supramolecular Alloys from Fluorinated Hybrid Tri4Di6 Imine Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eight hybrid Tri4Di6 imine cages with a tuneable degree of fluorination and one fully fluorinated Tri4Di6 imine cage are formed by [4+6] dynamic imine condensation in solution. These cages with unlimited miscibility in the solid state were obtained as highly crystalline samples after recrystallization and even showed retention of the crystal lattice, forming essentially organic cage alloys mixing fluorinated and non&#8208;fluorinated building blocks, depicted as golden honeycomb&#8208;like structure. More information can be found in the Communication by B.&#8197;M. Schmidt et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100891).

         <title>TIPS&#8208;Ethynylated Naphthodiquinoline and Naphthodiacridine: Novel Diazabisacenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gluing together two monoazaacenes: The synthesis of two novel diazabisacenes with cata&#8208;annelated monoazaacene subunits sharing three joint bonds is reported. These &#8220;&#960;&#8208;extended pyrenes&#8221; exhibit global aromaticity with bond length alternations and optical spectra similar to acenes, thus justifying the term &#8220;bisacenes&#8221; for the compounds investigated. Introducing nitrogen into the bisacene backbone significantly increases stability compared to that of their hydrocarbon analogs.







Abstract
The synthesis of two diazabisacenes is reported. A bisboronated naphthalene was Suzuki&#8208;coupled to substituted ethyl nicotinates, then cyclized by intramolecular Friedel&#8208;Crafts acylation. The resulting diketones were alkynylated and reduced to give the title compounds, bis(TIPS&#8208;ethynyl)&#8208;substituted naphtha[1,8&#8208;gh:5,4&#8208;g&#8242;h&#8242;]diquinoline and naphtho[1,8&#8208;bc:5,4&#8208;b&#8242;c&#8242;]diacridine. Nitrogen incorporation stabilizes the bisacenes with respect to oxidation compared to their consanguine nonaza analogs.

         <title>Exploiting Transient Radical Cations as Br&#248;nsted Acids for Allylic C&#8211;H Heteroarylation of Enol Silyl Ethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transient radical cations, generated through single&#8208;electron oxidation of enol silyl ethers by the excited Ir&#8208;based photocatalyst, can be exploited as Br&#248;nsted acids for the activation of cyanopyridines. The protonation allows facile single&#8208;electron reduction of the cyanopyridinium to generate radical intermediates and concomitantly converts the radical cations into nucleophilic allylic radicals to be engaged in the radical&#8208;radical coupling to produce heteroarylated enol silyl ethers.







Abstract
Intermediary radical cations, generated through single&#8208;electron oxidation of enol silyl ethers by excited Ir&#8208;based photocatalysts, can be exploited as Br&#248;nsted acids for the activation of heteroarylcyanides. This strategy enables the direct allylic C&#8722;H heteroarylation of enol silyl ethers under visible&#8208;light irradiation.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship for Di&#8208; up to Tetranuclear Macrocyclic Ruthenium Catalysts in Homogeneous Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comparative study on chemical and photochemical water oxidation with a homologous series of di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetranuclear macrocyclic Ru(bda) complexes has shown that the catalytic efficiency of this novel class of water oxidation catalysts (WOCs) increases per Ru unit with the increasing macrocycle size, revealing the tetranuclear macrocycle as one of the best performing homogeneous WOCs.







Abstract
Two di&#8208; and tetranuclear Ru(bda) (bda: 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;6,6&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylate) macrocyclic complexes were synthesized and their catalytic activities in chemical and photochemical water oxidation investigated in a comparative manner to our previously reported trinuclear congener. Our studies have shown that the catalytic activities of this homologous series of multinuclear Ru(bda) macrocycles in homogeneous water oxidation are dependent on their size, exhibiting highest efficiencies for the largest tetranuclear catalyst. The turnover frequencies (TOFs) have increased from di&#8208; to tetranuclear macrocycles not only per catalyst molecule but more importantly also per Ru unit with TOF of 6&#8197;s&#8722;1 to 8.7&#8197;s&#8722;1 and 10.5&#8197;s&#8722;1 in chemical and 0.6&#8197;s&#8722;1 to 3.3&#8197;s&#8722;1 and 5.8&#8197;s&#8722;1 in photochemical water oxidation per Ru unit, respectively. Thus, for the first time, a clear structure&#8211;activity relationship could be established for this novel class of macrocyclic water oxidation catalysts.

Between the sheets: A nanosheet&#8208;stacked hierarchical MFI zeolite (NSHM) has been synthesized by using a triply branched s&#8208;triazine&#8208;based surfactant as a bifunctional soft template, and a mechanism for its formation is proposed. The NSHM had abundant mesopores created by the stacked nanosheets and a high surface area (430&#8197;m2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1). Moreover, superior catalytic performance in the oxidation of cyclohexane is shown by NSHM with palladium loading.







Abstract
Soft template designing is the most promising strategy for the synthesis of zeolite nanosheets. MFI nanosheets directed by soft templates (containing long&#8208;chain alkyl groups or aromatic groups as hydrophobic component) can be found frequently; however, so far, MFI nanosheets synthesized by soft templates with aromatic heterocycle groups (e.&#8201;g., s&#8208;triazine groups) are rare. Herein, a nanosheet&#8208;stacked hierarchical MFI zeolite (NSHM) has been synthesized by using a triply branched s&#8208;triazine&#8208;based surfactant as a bifunctional organic structure&#8208;directing agent. On the basis of a geometrical match relationship, a formation model has been proposed. Synthesized NSHM had abundant mesopores stacked by nanosheets and exhibited a high surface area (430&#8197;m2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1). The 1&#8197;wt% Pd/NSHM attained a significant increase in yield of cyclohexanol/cyclohexanone mixture (from 66 to 85&#8201;%) in the oxidation of cyclohexane compared with Silicalite&#8208;1 and SBA&#8208;15 as supports.

         <title>A Nazarov&#8208;Ene Tandem Reaction for the Stereoselective Construction of Spiro Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigations on Lewis&#8208; and Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;mediated cyclizations of trienones revealed a novel Nazarov cyclization/ene reaction tandem reaction. This reaction allows the stereoselective construction of quaternary spirocenters, with a &#946;&#8208;hydroxyl group acting as superb stereodirecting element. The produced spirocycles possess useful functionality for further modifications, making them potentially valuable synthetic intermediates.







Abstract
The different reactivity of trienones under Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acids catalysis was investigated, resulting in distinct cyclization products and carbon backbones that originated either from a conjugate Prins cyclization or an interrupted Nazarov cyclization. In particular, an unprecedented Nazarov cyclization tandem reaction is presented, terminating the oxyallyl cation by an ene&#8208;type reaction, and leading stereoselectively to bicyclic spiro compounds. The terminal olefin of this motif represents a useful handle for further functionalization, making it a strategic intermediate in total syntheses. The tandem Nazarov/ene cyclization was shown to be preferred over a Nazarov/[3+2] tandem reaction for all our substrates, independent of chain length. Deuteration studies further support the mechanistic hypothesis of the terminating ene reaction.

         <title>Pentafluorophenyl Esters as Exchangeable Stoppers for the Construction of Photoactive [2]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rotaxane building blocks with pentafluorophenyl ester stoppers have been efficiently prepared and their treatment with various nucleophiles provided a wide range of rotaxanes with amide, ester or thioester stoppers. This new strategy also gave easy access to a photoactive rotaxane incorporating a fulleropillar[5]arene moiety and two Bodipy stoppers. Despite the absence of covalent connectivity between the Bodipy subunits and the fullerene, efficient through space excited state interactions have been evidenced in this rotaxane. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J.&#8208;F. Nierengarten et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100943).

         <title>Scalable Production of Ambient Stable Hybrid Bismuth&#8208;Based Materials: AACVD of Phenethylammonium Bismuth Iodide Films**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compact and stable bismuth halide&#8208;based hybrid material thin films were grown using aerosol&#8208;assisted chemical vapor deposition. The dependence of structural and optoelectronic properties of phenethylammonium bismuth iodide films were evaluated on varying substrates, deposition temperatures and curing conditions. The morphology and optical band&#8208;bending effects were related to synthetic parameters, and crack&#8208;free films were obtained with high moisture resistance.







Abstract
Large homogeneous and adherent coatings of phenethylammonium bismuth iodide were produced using the cost&#8208;effective and scalable aerosol&#8208;assisted chemical vapor deposition (AACVD) methodology. The film morphology was found to depend on the deposition conditions and substrates, resulting in different optical properties to those reported from their spin&#8208;coated counterparts. Optoelectronic characterization revealed band bending effects occurring between the hybrid material and semiconducting substrates (TiO2 and FTO) due to heterojunction formation, and the optical bandgap of the hybrid material was calculated from UV&#8208;visible and PL spectrometry to be 2.05&#8197;eV. Maximum values for hydrophobicity and crystallographic preferential orientation were observed for films deposited on FTO/glass substrates, closely followed by values from films deposited on TiO2/glass substrates.

         <title>Self&#8208;assembly of Amphiphilic Porphyrins To Construct Nanoparticles for Highly Efficient Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pull yourself together! Three photosensitizers with triphenylphosphine units and different lengths of ethylene glycol chains have been synthesized to improve amphiphilicity. Of the three photosensitizers, TPP&#8722;PPh3&#8722;4PEG is the most efficient (singlet oxygen yield: 0.89) for tumor photodynamic therapy not only because of its definite constituent, but also because its amphiphilic structure allows it to self&#8208;assemble in water.







Abstract
Hydrophobic photosensitizers greatly affect cell permeability and enrichment in tumors, but they cannot be used directly for clinical applications because they always aggregate in water, preventing their circulation in the blood and accumulation in tumor cells. As a result, amphiphilic photosensitizers are highly desirable. Although nanomaterial&#8208;based photosensitizers can solve water solubility, they have the disadvantages of complicated operation, poor reproducibility, low drug loading, and poor stability. In this work, an efficient synthesis strategy is proposed that converts small molecules into nanoparticles in 100&#8201;% aqueous solution by molecular assembly without the addition of any foreign species. Three photosensitizers with triphenylphosphine units and ethylene glycol chains of different lengths, TPP&#8722;PPh3, TPP&#8722;PPh3&#8722;2PEG and TPP&#8722;PPh3&#8722;4PEG, were synthesized to improve amphiphilicity.

         <title>Morphology Engineering of Fullerene[C70] Microcrystals: From Perfect Cubes, Defective Hoppers to Novel Cruciform&#8208;Pillars</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of C70 microcrystals with high uniformity from perfect cubes, defective hoppers to novel cruciform&#8208;pillars were obtained by reprecipitation method. Among them, novel pillar&#8208;shaped microcrystals are obtained for the first time by further decreasing the amount of mesitylene. The hopper&#8208;shaped microcrystals exhibit excellent photoluminescence properties relative to those of cubes and cruciform&#8208;pillars owing to the enhanced light absorption, proving their potential applications in optoelectronic devices.







Abstract
Controlled crystallization of fullerene molecules into ordered molecular assemblies is important for their applications. However, the morphology engineering of fullerene[C70] assemblies is challenging, and complicated architectures have rarely been reported due to the low molecular symmetry of C70 molecules, which makes their crystallization difficult to control and the low production yield as well. Herein, with the assistance of solvent intercalation, a general reprecipitation approach is reported to prepare morphologically controllable C70 microcrystals with mesitylene as a good solvent and n&#8208;propanol as a poor solvent in one solvent system without replacing specific solvents. A series of C70 microcrystals with high uniformity from perfect cubes and defective hoppers to novel cruciform&#8208;pillars are obtained by intentionally tuning C70 concentration and the volume ratio of mesitylene to n&#8208;propanol. Among them, novel cruciform&#8208;pillar&#8208;shaped microcrystals are obtained for the first time by further decreasing the amount of mesitylene in the solvent&#8208;intercalated microcrystals. Notably, the C70 concentration is a key parameter for the selective growth of C70 hopper, rather than the volume ratio of mesitylene to n&#8208;propanol. Interestingly, the hopper&#8208;shaped microcrystals exhibit excellent photoluminescence properties relative to those of cubes and cruciform&#8208;pillars owing to the enhanced light absorption, proving their potential applications in optoelectronic devices. This study offers new insights into the morphology&#8208;controlled synthesis of other micro/nanostructured organic microcrystals and the fine tuning of photoluminescence properties of organic crystals.

         <title>Tailoring Valence Tautomerism by Using Redox Potentials: Studies on Ferrocene&#8208;Based Triarylmethylium Dyes with Electron&#8208;Poor Fluorenylium and Thioxanthylium Acceptors</title>

         <dc:description>
Going radical: Valence tautomerism between diamagnetic ferrocene&#8208;triarylmethylium and ferrocenium&#8208;triarylmethyl diradical species was purposefully introduced by carefully selecting the organic tritylium&#8208;type substituent so that its reduction potential was reasonably close to that for oxidation of the ferrocenyl constituent. The diradical valence tautomer and the paramagnetic reduced ferrocenyl&#8208;triarylmethyl complexes were found to dimerize extensively, as verified by spin counting via quantitative EPR spectroscopy.







Abstract
Three new electrochromic ferrocenyl triarylmethylium dyes with fluorenylium (1&#8201;a+, 1&#8201;b+) or thioxanthylium (1&#8201;c+) residues were selected in order to keep the intrinsic differences of redox potentials for ferrocene oxidation and triarylmethylium reduction small and to trigger valence tautomerism (VT). UV/Vis/NIR and quantitative EPR spectroscopy identified paramagnetic diradical isomers 1&#8201;a..+&#8211;1&#8201;c..+ alongside diamagnetic forms 1&#8201;a+&#8211;1&#8201;c+, which renders these complexes magnetochemical switches. The diradical forms 1&#8201;a..+&#8211;1&#8201;c..+ as well as the one&#8208;electron&#8208;reduced triarylmethyl forms of the complexes were found to dimerize in solution. For radical 1&#8201;a., dimerization occurs on the timescale of cyclic voltammetry; this allowed us to determine the kinetics and equilibrium constant for this process by digital simulation. M&#246;&#223;bauer spectroscopy indicated that 1&#8201;a+ and 1&#8201;b+ retain VT even in the solid state. UV/Vis/NIR spectro&#8208;electrochemistry revealed the poly&#8208;electrochromic behaviour of these complexes by establishing the distinctly different electronic absorption profiles of the corresponding oxidized and reduced forms.

         <title>Accessing Improbable Foldamer Shapes with Strained Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Frustrating folding propensity by imposing a macrocyclic structure to an otherwise helical backbone produces improbable yet stable strained molecular shapes. Both experiments and computational studies show how aromatic oligoamide foldamers constrained within a macrocycle try to fulfill their strong propensity to adopt helical conformations by forming local loops and unfolded sites that connect helical segments. Defined fluxional conformational pathways can be evidenced in such molecules.







Abstract
The alkylation of some secondary amide functions with a dimethoxybenzyl (DMB) group in oligomers of 8&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;quinolinecarboxylic acid destabilizes the otherwise favored helical conformations, and allows for cyclization to take place. A cyclic hexamer and a cyclic heptamer were produced in this manner. After DMB removal, X&#8208;ray crystallography and NMR show that the macrocycles adopt strained conformations that would be improbable in noncyclic species. The high helix folding propensity of the main chain is partly expressed in these conformations, but it remains frustrated by macrocyclization. Despite being homomeric, the macrocycles possess inequivalent monomer units. Experimental and computational studies highlight specific fluxional pathways within these structures. Extensive simulated annealing molecular dynamics allow for the prediction of the conformations for larger macrocycles with up to sixteen monomers.

         <title>Inherent Ethyl Acetate Selectivity in a Trianglimine Molecular Solid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The separation of ethyl acetate from its azeotropic mixtures with ethanol is of great importance in the industrial production of ethyl acetate. Current purification techniques include extractive distillation and azeotropic distillation are energy&#8208;intensive. Guided by crystal structure prediction, a &#8220;templating&#8221; strategy was used to construct selective binding sites in a trianglimine macrocycle crystal for the solvent molecule. These crystals exhibit inherently high selectivity towards ethyl acetate, reasonable kinetics, and show promise for real&#8208;life, practical dynamic separations.







Abstract
Ethyl acetate is an important chemical raw material and solvent. It is also a key volatile organic compound in the brewing industry and a marker for lung cancer. Materials that are highly selective toward ethyl acetate are needed for its separation and detection. Here, we report a trianglimine macrocycle (TAMC) that selectively adsorbs ethyl acetate by forming a solvate. Crystal structure prediction showed this to be the lowest energy solvate structure available. This solvate leaves a metastable, &#8220;templated&#8221; cavity after solvent removal. Adsorption and breakthrough experiments confirmed that TAMC has adequate adsorption kinetics to separate ethyl acetate from azeotropic mixtures with ethanol, which is a challenging and energy&#8208;intensive industrial separation.

         <title>Asymmetric Spirobiacridine&#8208;based Delayed Fluorescence Emitters for High&#8208;performance Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three types of asymmetric spirobiacridine&#8208;based delayed fluorescent emitters are developed and investigated. The triphenyltriazine&#8208;based emitter exhibited a unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), high horizontal orientation ratio (&#920;) of over 80&#8201;%, and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of over 30&#8201;%. The substituents on the triazine electron&#8208;acceptor unit drastically affects the photophysical property and device performance.







Abstract
Recently, researchers have focused on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) for efficient future lighting and displays. Among TADF emitters, a combination of triazine and acridine is a promising candidate for realizing high&#8208;efficiency organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs). However, simultaneous development of perfect horizontal orientation (&#920;=100&#8201;%) and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of over 40&#8201;% is still challenging. Here, to obtain insights for further improvements of a triazine/acridine combination, various asymmetric spirobiacridine (SBA)&#8208;based TADF emitters with a unity photoluminescence quantum yield and high &#920; ratio of over 80&#8201;% were developed. Furthermore, the substitution effects of the triazine acceptor unit on the photophysical properties were studied, including molecular orientations and OLED performance. The corresponding OLED exhibited sky&#8208;blue emission with a high EQE of over 30&#8201;%.

         <title>Synergistic Ir/Cu Catalysis for Asymmetric Allylic Alkylation of Oxindoles: Enantio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Construction of Quaternary and Tertiary Stereocenters</title>

         <dc:description>
Synergistic Ir/Cu Catalysis: a highly regio&#8208;, enantio&#8208;, and diastereoselective allylic alkylation of 3&#8208;alkyl oxindoles was developed through synergistic iridium and copper catalysis, providing a series of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted oxindole derivatives containing adjacent quaternary and tertiary stereogenic centers in excellent yields, enantiomeric excess, and diastereomeric ratio (for 30&#8197;examples, up to 97&#8201;% yield, &gt;99&#8201;% ee, and &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr).







Abstract
3,3&#8208;Disubstituted oxindoles bearing quaternary and tertiary stereogenic centers are privileged structural motifs, which widely exist in pharmaceutical and natural products. Herein, a highly regio&#8208;, enantio&#8208;, and diastereoselective allylic alkylation of 3&#8208;alkyl oxindoles through synergistic iridium and copper catalysis is described, which provides a series of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted oxindole derivatives containing adjacent quaternary and tertiary stereogenic centers in excellent yields, enantiomeric excess, and diastereomeric ratio (for 30 examples, up to 97&#8201;% yield, &gt;99&#8201;% ee, and &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr). This method provides exclusive branched selectivity, excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities, and good functional compatibility. Control experiments suggested that the chiral copper catalyst is required for achieving high reactivities and diastereoselectivities under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>Self&#8208;supporting Atmosphere&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of 1D Mo2C&#8208;based Catalyst for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A very fine catalyst: A 1D catalyst consisting of ultrafine Mo2C nanoparticles and nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon has been fabricated for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Self&#8208;supporting gases play a vital role in building the 1D and porous structure of the materials, which facilitates charge and mass transfer during the catalytic process. The optimized catalyst exhibits a superior overpotential and Tafel slope.







Abstract
One&#8208;dimensional materials exhibit fascinating properties in electrocatalytic applications but their fabrication faces the challenge of tedious and complicated operations. We have developed a bottom&#8208;up strategy to construct a 1D metal carbide catalyst (Mo2C@NC) consisting of ultrafine Mo2C nanoparticles embedded within nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon layers by simply calcining a mixture of ammonium molybdate, urea and melamine. Experimental results and thermodynamic calculations demonstrate that the retainable pyrolysis&#8208;generated self&#8208;supporting atmosphere plays a crucial role in the crystalline phase and morphology of materials. When functioned as an electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the achieved Mo2C@NC presents an excellent catalytic activity as well as outstanding stability. This work could shed fresh light onto the facile synthesis of effective HER catalysts with 1D nanostructure.

         <title>Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions in the Biphenyl Crystal: Is the Planar Conformer a Transition State?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A combined experimental and theoretical study of the biphenyl (BP) crystal is presented. The X&#8208;ray diffraction data collected at 100 K were subject to Hirshfeld atom and multipole refinements of the electron density, &#961;(r). A theoretical exploration of the potential energy surface (PES) of the crystal was also carried out. This investigation challenges the common assumption that the planar structure of BP in the phase I crystal is an average from two twisted configurations in a double&#8208;well potential. The theoretical computations provide compelling evidence that this structure corresponds to a minimum on the PES hence to a stable molecular arrangement. Consistently, the experiment showed no evidence of positional or dynamic disorder. The intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;hydrogen bonds detected are not repulsive. The topological analysis of the experimental and theoretical &#961;(r) reveals that both the intra&#8208; and intermolecular H&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;H and the C&#8208;H&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#960; contacts stabilize the BP crystal.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule White Light&#8208;Emitting Starburst Donor&#8208;Acceptor Triphenylamine Derivatives and its Application as Ratiometric Luminescent Molecular Thermometer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The work reports&#160;single&#8208;molecule WLE both in solution and thin&#8208;film state by judiciously controlled &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization between the triarylamine sub&#8208;chromophoric units. Triphenylamine (TPA) form the central core, and the phenyl rings are substituted with the electron&#8208;deficient acceptor, 3&#8208;ethylrhodanine (Rh) and electron&#8208;rich donor, triphenylamine or carbazole. The enforced biphenyl configuration amongst the TPA core and the other donors renders the poor &#960;&#8208;conjugation in the entire chromophore, thereby the individual sub&#8208;chromophoric units still retain their individual emission characteristics which cover all the three primary color emissions. TPA&#8208;Rh units exhibit broad fluorescence in the green&#8208;red region originated from the local excited (LE) state and intramolecular charge transfer state (ICT), strongly influenced by the solvent, water, and temperature. Different fluorescence parameters, including spectral maxima, ratiometric changes in ICT emission at the expense of blue emission from terminal donor units, and changes in a lifetime, exerts linear relationship against temperature between 180 &#8211; 330 K, thereby functioning as a multiparameter luminescent molecular thermometer. A temperature coefficient of 0.19 K&#8208;1 in ratiometric fluorescence changes along with the spectral shift of 0.3 nm K&#8722;1 and its workability over the wide temperature makes these molecules promising materials for potential applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Saddle&#8208;shaped Building Blocks: A New Concept for Designing Fully Conjugated 3D Organic Semiconducting Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Currently, most organic semiconducting materials (OSMs) are &#960;&#8208;conjugated structures in one or two dimension (2D), where the lack of layer&#8208;layer &#960;&#8208;conjugation connection greatly blocks their electron delocalization and transport. The 3D fully conjugated materials could solve this issue because they can provide efficient charge&#8208;transport pathways throughout the whole 3D skeleton, in which the suitable 3D building block is the key to the development of fully conjugated 3D OSMs. Cyclooctatetraene (COT) and its derivatives are good candidates due to their &#960;&#8208;conjugation with 3D saddle&#8208;shaped architecture. In this Concept, we discuss the key features of saddle&#8208;shaped COT&#8208;based derivatives and present the current development of using the COT derivatives as building blocks to construct the 3D fully conjugated organic small compound&#8208; and polymer&#8208;based OSMs. The properties and perspectives of these OSMs in photovoltaics, electro&#8208;catalysis and electrical conductivities are also discussed. These recent advances in the developing 3D fully conjugated materials could potentially open up a new frontier in the design of OSM.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimizing Fe&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks through Ligand Conformation Regulation for Efficient Dye Adsorption and C2H2/CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two 3D Fe&#8208;MOFs (UPC&#8208;60&#8208;Cl and UPC&#8208;60&#8208;NH2) were constructed based on UPC&#8208;200(Fe)&#8208;H&#8208;H2O by replacing part of the benzene rings with C=C bonds and modifying &#8722;Cl&#8722; and &#8722;NH2 on the ligand. The synergistic effect of diversified structure and modification of functional groups endow UPC&#8208;60&#8208;Cl and UPC&#8208;60&#8208;NH2 with high adsorption capacity for dyes and good C2H2/CO2 separation ability. Through reasonable regulation of ligands with functional groups, the structure can be precisely regulated to achieve the adsorption and separation of specific guest molecules.







Abstract
Regulating the structure of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) by adjusting the ligands reasonably is expected to enhance the interaction of MOFs on special molecules/ions, which has significant application value for the selective adsorption of guest molecules. Herein, two tricarboxylic ligands H3L&#8722;Cl and H3L&#8722;NH2 were designed and synthesized based on the ligand H3TTCA by replacing part of the benzene rings with C=C bonds and modifying the chlorine and amino groups on the 4&#8208;position of the benzene ring. Two 3D Fe&#8208;MOFs (UPC&#8208;60&#8208;Cl and UPC&#8208;60&#8208;NH2) with the new topology types were constructed. As the C=C bonds of the ligands have flexible torsion angles, UPC&#8208;60&#8208;Cl features three types of irregular 2D channels, while UPC&#8208;60&#8208;NH2 has a cage with two types of windows on the surface. The synergistic effect of unique channels and modification of functional groups endows UPC&#8208;60&#8208;Cl and UPC&#8208;60&#8208;NH2 with high adsorption capacity for organic dyes. Compound UPC&#8208;60&#8208;Cl shows high adsorption capacity for CV (147.2&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1), RHB (100.3&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1), and MO (220.9&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1), whereas UPC&#8208;60&#8208;NH2 exhibits selective adsorption of MO (158.7&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1). Meanwhile, based on the diverse pore structure and modification of active sites, UPC&#8208;60&#8208;Cl and UPC&#8208;60&#8208;NH2 show the selective separation of equimolar C2H2/CO2. Therefore, reasonable regulation of organic ligands plays a significant role in guiding the structure diversification and performance improvement of MOFs.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Dependent Stabilization of a Charge Transfer State is the Key to Ultrafast Triplet State Formation in an Epigenetic DNA Nucleoside</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrafast excited&#8208;state relaxation mechanisms of the epigenetic nucleoside 5fdCyd are revealed. Upon exposure to UV light, solvent&#8208;dependent charge transfer state&#8208;induced intersystem crossing is direct observed by TRIR and QM calculation.







Abstract
2&#8217;&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;5&#8208;formylcytidine (5fdCyd), a naturally occurring nucleoside found in mammalian DNA and mitochondrial RNA, exhibits important epigenetic functionality in biological processes. Because it efficiently generates triplet excited states, it is an endogenous photosensitizer capable of damaging DNA, but the intersystem crossing (ISC) mechanism responsible for ultrafast triplet state generation is poorly understood. In this study, time&#8208;resolved mid&#8208;IR spectroscopy and quantum mechanical calculations reveal the distinct ultrafast ISC mechanisms of 5fdCyd in water versus acetonitrile. Our experiment indicates that in water, ISC to triplet states occurs within 1&#8197;ps after 285&#8197;nm excitation. PCM&#8208;TD&#8208;DFT computations suggest that this ultrafast ISC is mediated by a singlet state with significant cytosine&#8208;to&#8208;formyl charge&#8208;transfer (CT) character. In contrast, ISC in acetonitrile proceeds via a dark 1n&#960;* state with a lifetime of &#8764;3&#8197;ps. CT&#8208;induced ISC is not favored in acetonitrile because reaching the minimum of the gateway CT state is hampered by intramolecular hydrogen bonding, which enforces planarity between the aldehyde group and the aromatic group. Our study provides a comprehensive picture of the non&#8208;radiative decay of 5fdCyd in solution and new insights into the factors governing ISC in biomolecules. We propose that the intramolecular CT state observed here is a key to the excited&#8208;state dynamics of epigenetic nucleosides with modified exocyclic functional groups, paving the way to study their effects in DNA strands.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly and Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission in Aqueous Media of Responsive Luminescent Copper(I) Coordination Polymer Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of coordination polymer nanoparticles by a copper(I) coordination compound containing cubane&#8208;like clusters as nodes connected by hybrid thioether&#8208;phosphine ligands has been achieved in aqueous media. The formed particles display a yellow aggregation&#8208;induced emission. The change in the environment triggers a morphological transformation towards elongated aggregates due to changes in the coordination environment, opening the cubane units and causing a cyan emission. More information can be found in the Full Paperby G. Moreno&#8208;Alc&#225;ntar et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100865).

         <title>Hydrogen Bond Acceptor Propensity of Different Fluorine Atom Types: An Analysis of Experimentally and Computationally Derived Parameters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ab initio computed parameters and experimental 19F&#8197;NMR chemical shifts are used to assess the differential hydrogen bond acceptor propensity of various types of fluorine atoms with a particular emphasis for the different types of alkyl fluorides. Although weak, the hydrogen bond complexes formed by organic fluorine have important implications.







Abstract
The propensity of organic fluorine acting as a weak hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) in intermolecular and intramolecular interactions has been the subject of many experimental and theoretical studies often reaching different conclusions. Over the last few years, new and stronger evidences have emerged for the direct involvement of fluorine in weak hydrogen bond (HB) formation. However, not all the fluorine atom types can act as weak HBA. In this work, the differential HBA propensity of various types of fluorine atoms was analyzed with a particular emphasis for the different types of alkyl fluorides. This was carried out by evaluating ab initio computed parameters, experimental 19F&#8197;NMR chemical shifts and small molecule crystallographic structures (extracted from the CSD database). According to this analysis, shielded (with reference to the 19F&#8197;NMR chemical shift) alkyl mono&#8208;fluorinated motifs display the highest HBA propensity in agreement with solution studies. Although much weaker than other well&#8208;characterized HB complexes, the fragile HBs formed by these fluorinated motifs have important implications for the chemical&#8208;physical and structural properties of the molecules, chemical reactions, and protein&#8211;ligand recognition.

         <title>Distorted Porphyrins with High Stability: Synthesis and Characteristic Electronic Properties of Mono&#8208; and Di&#8208;Nuclear Tricarbonyl Rhenium Tetraazaporphyrin Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mono&#8208; and di&#8208;nuclear tricarbonyl Re(I) tetraazaporphyrin (TAP: phthalocyanine (Pc) analogue) complexes were newly synthesized. The ReTAP complexes are structurally distorted, but are shown to be highly stable from the viewpoint of the tolerance toward oxidation and the demetallation in polar solvents. Also, the ReTAP complexes show unique broad Q bands, owing to the admixture of the &#960;&#8208;&#960;* and MLCT characters. The present study is useful for controlling electronic properties and realizing high stability in Pc analogues.







Abstract
Mono&#8208; and di&#8208;nuclear tricarbonyl Re(I) tetraazaporphyrin complexes (Re1TAP and Re2TAP) are investigated and compared with Re(I) phthalocyanine complexes (Re1Pc and Re2Pc). Although Re2Pc is unstable in polar solvents, and easily undergoes demetallation reaction, the coordination of the TAP ligand significantly improves the tolerance toward polar solvents, affording more stability to Re2TAP. Additionally, the incorporation of [Re(CO)3]+ unit(s) and the TAP ligand results in remarkable positive shifts in both oxidation and reduction potentials. Consequently, the more positive oxidation potentials of the ReTAP complexes significantly increase the tolerance toward oxidation, while the reduction potential indicates that Re2TAP is suitable for a soluble electron acceptor. In contrast to Re1Pc and Re2Pc, Re1TAP and Re2TAP show unique broad Q bands, which can be attributed to the admixture of the &#960;&#8208;&#960;* and metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer characters, owing to the lowered &#960; orbital energy in the TAP complexes. This study is useful for controlling electronic properties and realizing high stability in Pc analogues.

         <dc:description>Disrotatory &#8208; thermally allowed &#8208; 2p&#8208;electrocyclic ring&#8208;opening reactions require high temperatures to proceed. Herein, we report the first anion&#8208;accelerated 2p&#8208;electrocyclic ring&#8208;opening of 6,6&#8208;dihalobicyclo[3.1.0]hexan&#8208;2&#8208;ones at low temperature, to give their corresponding  meta  &#8208;halophenols in good to high yields (18 examples, 29&#8208;92% yield, average 65%). Many of the phenols hold unconventional substitution patterns and are reported here for the first time. Furthermore, the strength of the methodology was featured by the total synthesis of the densely functionalized phenolic natural product caramboxin (isolated as the lactam dehydrate). The reaction mechanism underlying the anion&#8208;acceleration was investigated by an ab initio study, which concluded that base mediated proton abstraction anti to the concurrently departing endo&#8208;bromine was the initiating step in an overall concerted reaction mechanism leading directly to the  meta  &#8208;halophenol.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Evaluation of Diketopyrrolopyrrole Derivatives for Non&#8208;aqueous Redox Flow Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Redox flow batteries (RFBs) employing non&#8208;aqueous electrolytes could potentially operate at much higher cell voltages, and therefore afford higher energy and power densities, in comparison to RFBs employing aqueous electrolytes. The development of such high voltage non&#8208;aqueous RFBs requires anolytes that are electrochemically stable, especially in the presence of trace oxygen and/or moisture. The inherent atmospheric reactivity of anolytes, mandates judicious molecular design with high electron affinity and electrochemical stability. In this study, we propose diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) based TDPP&#8208;Hex&#8208;CN 4 as a stable redox&#8208;active molecule for anolytes in non&#8208;aqueous organic RFB. We demonstrate organic RFBs utilizing TDPP&#8208;Hex&#8208;CN 4 as anolyte with unisol blue (UB) (1,4&#8208;bis(isopropylamino) anthraquinone and 1,4&#8208;Di&#8208;  tert  &#8208;butyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;bis (2&#8208;methoxyethoxy) benzene (DBBB) as catholytes. Cyclic voltammetry measurements with scans repeated over 200 cycles were performed to establish the electrochemical stability of redox pairs. Symmetric flow cell studies show that TDPP&#8208;Hex&#8208;CN4 exhibits stable capacity up to 700 cycles. Redox flow cells employing TDPP&#8208;Hex&#8208;CN 4 / UB and TDPP&#8208;Hex&#8208;CN 4 / DBBB as redox pairs demonstrate that DPP derivatives are propitious materials for anolytes in all organic non&#8208;aqueous RFBs</dc:description>

A simple strategy has been successfully adopted to retain N atoms in&#8197;situ and increase production yield of a novel composite PAZ by mixing 3&#8197;wt&#8201;% of zinc borate (ZB) with poly(acrylonitrile&#8208;co&#8208;itaconic acid) (PANIA). After being carbonised at 700&#8201;&#176;C, PAZ&#8208;CF&#8208;700 maintains 90&#8201;% of the original N from PANIA. At the same time, PAZ&#8208;CF&#8208;700 also exhibits a good rate performance and excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability with a specific capacity of 94&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 4000 cycles at 1.6&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.







Abstract
Retaining nitrogen for polyacrylonitrile (PAN) based carbon anode is a cost&#8208;effective way to make full use of the advantages of PAN for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Here, a simple strategy has been successfully adopted to retain N atoms in&#8197;situ and increase production yield of a novel composite PAZ by mixing 3&#8197;wt&#8201;% of zinc borate (ZB) with poly (acrylonitrile&#8208;co&#8208;itaconic acid) (PANIA). Among the prepared carbonised fibre (CF) samples, PAZ&#8208;CF&#8208;700 maintains the highest N content, retaining 90&#8201;% of the original N from PANIA. It represents the highest capacity storage contribution (80.55&#8201;%) and the lowest impedance Rct (117&#8197;&#937;). Consequently, the specific capacity increases from 60&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 of PANIA&#8208;CF&#8208;700 to 190&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 of PAZ&#8208;CF&#8208;700 at a current density of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. At the same time, PAZ&#8208;CF&#8208;700 exhibits a good rate performance and excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability with a specific capacity of 94&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 4000 cycles at 1.6&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Zinc&#8208; and Cadmium meso&#8208;Aryl&#8208;Isoporphyrins: Non&#8208;Aromatic NIR Dyes with Distinct Conformational Features</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 30, Page 8021-8029, May 26, 2021. </description>

A new sign has risen in the porphyrin sky! Stable isoporphyrins can be produced as non&#8208;aromatic NIR dyes in yields up to 36&#8201;% by a one&#8208;pot process. Non&#8208;planar distortion modes are the key to control the optical spectra and the occurrence of isomers by means of synthesis. For the first time, the redox chemistry of isoporphyrins was studied by electrochemical methods, which is significant with regard to potential applications in photovoltaics.







Abstract
A series of pyrrolyl and dipyrrinyl isoporphyrins carrying different phenyl and thienyl groups is reported. The compounds are obtained by a one&#8208;pot approach in the presence of a template reagent. Thienyl derivatives gave better yields, and were the only subclass to form with steric hindrance. The structural analyses carried out on compounds 1 and 14 revealed distinct conformational differences which are likely to result from an intramolecular NH&#8230;Cl hydrogen bridge of the pyrrolyl subclass. In addition, this hydrogen bridge strongly favors one of the two possible atropisomers. Hindered rotation of the meso&#8208;aryl groups is observed only in the cases of methylbenzothienyl derivatives 10 and 15 and leads to the observation of several diastereomers. NIR absorptions up to 923&#8197;nm are found throughout. Electrochemical investigations into the 1e&#8722; and 2e&#8722; reduced species unravel axial ligand exchange dynamics for the zinc isoporphyrin radical, and the probable formation of a zinc phlorinate.

         <title>CO2 Capture by Hydroxylated Azine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 30, Page 8048-8055, May 26, 2021. </description>

Covalent organic frameworks were investigated towards their CO2 capture properties as a function of their textural and chemical features. Experimental and theoretical data indicated that the relative number of hydroxyl groups in the COF backbone acts as an adsorption threshold. For the best performing COF, a variety of CO2 concentrations and temperatures were investigated, showing excellent isothermal recyclability up to 3 cycles.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) RIO&#8208;13, RIO&#8208;12, RIO&#8208;11, and RIO&#8208;11m were investigated towards their CO2 capture properties by thermogravimetric analysis at 1&#8197;atm and 40&#8201;&#176;C. These microporous COFs bear in common the azine backbone composed of hydroxy&#8208;benzene moieties but differ in the relative number of hydroxyl groups present in each material. Thus, their sorption capacities were studied as a function of their textural and chemical properties. Their maximum CO2 uptake values showed a strong correlation with an increasing specific surface area, but that property alone could not fully explain the CO2 uptake data. Hence, the specific CO2 uptake, combined with DFT calculations, indicated that the relative number of hydroxyl groups in the COF backbone acts as an adsorption threshold, as the hydroxyl groups were indeed identified as relevant adsorption sites in all the studied COFs. Additionally, the best performing COF was thoroughly investigated, experimentally and theoretically, for its CO2 capture properties in a variety of CO2 concentrations and temperatures, and showed excellent isothermal recyclability up to 3 cycles.

&lt;p&gt;Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) RIO-13, RIO-12, RIO-11, and RIO-11m were investigated towards their CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture properties by thermogravimetric analysis at 1&#8197;atm and 40&#8201;&#176;C. These microporous COFs bear in common the azine backbone composed of hydroxy-benzene moieties but differ in the relative number of hydroxyl groups present in each material. Thus, their sorption capacities were studied as a function of their textural and chemical properties. Their maximum CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake values showed a strong correlation with an increasing specific surface area, but that property alone could not fully explain the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake data. Hence, the specific CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake, combined with DFT calculations, indicated that the relative number of hydroxyl groups in the COF backbone acts as an adsorption threshold, as the hydroxyl groups were indeed identified as relevant adsorption sites in all the studied COFs. Additionally, the best performing COF was thoroughly investigated, experimentally and theoretically, for its CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture properties in a variety of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations and temperatures, and showed excellent isothermal recyclability up to 3 cycles.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Cyano Derivatives of 7&#8208;Aminoquinoline That Are Highly Emissive in Water: Potential for Sensing Applications</title>

6&#8208;Cyano&#8208;7&#8208;azidoquinoline was synthesized and found to be non&#8208;emissive in water, while the amino derivative 6CN&#8722;7AQ exhibits intense emission, making the azido/amino pair excellent in sensing H2S. Moreover, conjugation of 6CN&#8722;7AQ with peptide renders a nearly non&#8208;emissive composite that can be digested by proteinase&#8208;K, recovering intense 6CN&#8722;7AQ emission with &#8764;200&#8208;fold enhancement.







Abstract
6&#8208;Cyano&#8208;7&#8208;aminoquinoline (6CN&#8722;7AQ) and 3&#8208;cyano&#8208;7&#8208;aminoquinoline (3CN&#8722;7AQ) were synthesized and found to exhibit intense emission with quantum yield as high as 63&#8201;% and 85&#8201;%, respectively, in water. Conversely, their derivatives 6&#8208;cyano&#8208;7&#8208;azidoquinoline (6CN&#8722;7N3Q) and 3&#8208;cyano&#8208;7&#8208;azidoquinoline (3CN&#8722;7N3Q) show virtually no emission, which makes them suitable to be used as recognition agents in azide reactions based on fluorescence recovery. Moreover, conjugation of 6CN&#8722;7AQ with a hydrophobic biomembrane&#8208;penetration peptide PFVYLI renders a nearly non&#8208;emissive 6CN&#8722;7AQ&#8208;PFVYLI composite, which can be digested by proteinase K, recovering the highly emissive 6CN&#8722;7AQ with &#8764;200&#8208;fold enhancement. The result provides an effective early confirmation for RT&#8208;qPCR in viral detection.

         <title>Asymmetric Catalytic Approach to Multilayer 3D Chirality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 30, Page 8013-8020, May 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first asymmetric catalytic approach to multilayer 3D chirality by using Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;couplings in the presence of new chiral amide&#8208;phosphines is reported. The resulting multilayer products showed strong luminescence under UV irradiation, and displayed strong aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE).







Abstract
The first asymmetric catalytic approach to multilayer 3D chirality has been achieved by using Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;couplings. New chiral catalysts were designed and screened under various catalytic systems that proved chiral amide&#8208;phosphines to be more efficient ligands than other candidates. The multilayer 3D framework was unambiguously determined by X&#8208;ray structural analysis showing a parallel pattern of three layers consisting of top, middle and bottom aromatic rings. The X&#8208;ray structure of a catalyst complex, dichloride complex of Pd&#8208;phosphine amide, was obtained revealing an interesting asymmetric environment nearby the Pd metal center. Three rings of multilayer 3D products can be readily changed by varying aromatic ring&#8208;anchored starting materials. The resulting multilayer products displayed strong luminescence under UV irradiation and strong aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE). In the future, this work would benefit not only the field of asymmetric synthesis but also materials science, in particular polarized organic electronics, optoelectronics and photovoltaics.

Giant molecules self&#8208;assemble into long&#8208;range ordered lamellar structures in bulk with ultra&#8208;small domain sizes (down to 3 nm), driven by the strong tendency and fast kinetics of crystallization for the vinyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (VPOSS) segment. This crystallization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly strategy may offer an opportunity to create integrated circuits (ICs) with ultra&#8208;small feature sizes by lithographic techniques for the microelectronic industry. More information can be found in the Communication by Z.&#8208;H. Guo et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100638).

A new sign has risen in the porphyrin sky! Stable isoporphyrins can be produced as non&#8208;aromatic NIR dyes in yields up to 36% by a one&#8208;pot process. Non&#8208;planar distortion modes are the key to control the optical spectra and the occurrence of isomers by means of synthesis. For the first time, the redox chemistry of isoporphyrins was studied by electrochemical methods, which is significant with regard to potential applications in photovoltaics. The cover image shows the linear display of a zinc isoporphyrin as a constellation in the night sky of the northern hemisphere, between the constellations Orion and Big Dipper. In the foreground, the UV spectrum with the prominent NIR absorptions around 900&#8197;nm piles up as a mountain relief. More information can be found in the Full Paper by M. Br&#246;ring et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100686).

Chirality has existed in nature from the early stages of life on Earth. A new form of chirality, multilayer 3D chirality, has been established involving nearly parallel patterns. This work presents the first asymmetric catalytic approach to multi&#8208;layer 3D chirality. New complexes of Pd and chiral amide&#8208;phosphine ligands were utilized as catalysts for Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling for assembling various multilayer 3D chiral molecules, which displayed strong luminescence under UV irradiation and strong aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) of different colors. More information can be found in the Full Paper by G. Li et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100700).

         <title>Mechanistic and Kinetic Factors of ortho&#8208;Benzyne Formation in Hexadehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder (HDDA) Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 30, Page 7978-7991, May 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview highlights the mechanism of ortho&#8208;aryne formation via hexadehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reactions, based on quantum chemical calculations, as well as kinetic, preparative and ultrafast spectroscopic experiments. The influence of the steric, electronic, and radical&#8208;stabilizing effects of substituents attached to diyne/diynophile pairs and linked yne&#8208;diynes provide crucial insight into the reaction mechanism.







Abstract
With the rapid development of the hexadehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction (HDDA) from its first discovery in 1997, the question of whether a concerted or stepwise mechanism better describes the thermally activated formation of ortho&#8208;benzyne from a diyne and a diynophile has been debated. Mechanistic and kinetic investigations were able to show that this is not a black or white situation, as minor changes can tip the balance. For that reason, especially, linked yne&#8208;diynes were studied to examine steric, electronic, and radical&#8208;stabilizing effects of their terminal substituents on the reaction mechanism and kinetics. Furthermore, the influence of the nature of the linker on the HDDA reaction was explored. The more recently discovered photochemical HDDA reaction also gives ortho&#8208;arynes, which display the same reactivity as the thermally generated ones, but their formation might not proceed by the same mechanism. This minireview summarizes the current state of mechanistic understanding of the HDDA reaction.

&#8216;Power'ful Aminations. A simple transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free direct electrolytic amination strategy has been developed. The transformation takes place in the absence of any electrocatalyst by using cheap and easily available graphite electrodes. The reaction allows for the synthesis of carbazole derivatives via intramolecular C&#8722;H amination and also cross&#8208;coupling of (hetero)arenes and various N&#8208;arylamides in an undivided cell set up. The usage of an acidic solvent was beneficial as it eliminated the requirement of additional supporting electrolytes for the electrolysis.







Abstract
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free direct electrolytic C&#8722;H amination involving an electrochemically generated nitrenium ion intermediate has been developed. The electrosynthesis takes place in the absence of any organoiodine catalysts and is enabled by an in&#8197;situ generated electrolyte. A novel, efficient intramolecular and intermolecular C&#8722;H amination has been demonstrated using a simple reaction setup.

         <title>Towards Heteroleptic Dicoordinate CuII Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 30, Page 7998-8002, May 26, 2021. </description>

By employing a bulky carbazolyl substituent, heteroleptic dicoordinate copper complexes with CuII character were synthesised. Delocalisation of the spin density in the ligand scaffold as well as dispersion forces apparently play a role in the stabilisation of these compounds.







Abstract
In this work we detail our efforts to systematically generate stable dicoordinate CuII complexes. Initial experiments via metathesis reactions of a bulky potassium carbazolide (RK) with copper(II) salts indeed yielded a stable product, RCuOTf (1). However, subsequent attempts to grasp systematic synthetic access to complexes of the type RCuX (X=monoanionic ligand) proved difficult as many of the complexes rapidly decomposed in solution. By using triflate&#8208;related ligands such as ethyl sulfate and bistriflimide, the additional dicoordinate copper complexes RCuOSO3Et (2), [RCu(THF)][Cu(NTf2)2] (3) and RCuNTf2 (4) could be isolated. Spectroscopic indications corroborate more CuI than CuII character in all RCuX derivatives.

         <title>Crystallization Induced Self&#8208;Assembly: A Strategy to Achieve Ultra&#8208;Small Domain Sizes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 30, Page 7992-7997, May 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lamellar morphologies with ultra&#8208;small domain sizes (down to 3&#8197;nm) are achieved by the self&#8208;assembly of giant molecules. The driven force for the phase separation is attributed to the strong tendency and fast kinetics for crystallization of vinyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (VPOSS) segment. Upon the gamma ray radiation followed pyrolysis, ultra&#8208;thin two dimensional nano&#8208;silica sheets are obtained due to polymerization of vinyl group in VPOSS.







Abstract
Achieving self&#8208;assembled nanostructures with ultra&#8208;small feature sizes (e.&#8201;g., below 5&#8197;nm) is an important prerequisite for the development of block copolymer lithography. In this work, the preparation and self&#8208;assembly of a series of giant molecules composed of vinyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (VPOSS) tethered with monodispersed oligo(L&#8208;lactide) chains are presented. Small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results demonstrate that ultra&#8208;small domain sizes (down to 3&#8197;nm) of phase separated lamellar morphology are achieved in bulk, driven by the strong tendency and fast kinetics for crystallization of VPOSS moieties. Moreover, upon gamma ray radiation, VPOSS cages in the lamellar structure can be crosslinked via polymerization of the vinyl groups. After pyrolysis at high temperature, ultra&#8208;thin two&#8208;dimensional nano&#8208;silica sheets can be obtained.

         <title>Reevaluating the Solution Photophysics of Tetraphenylethylene at the Origin of their Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 30, Page 8003-8007, May 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through actinometric NMR evaluation of the photoisomerization kinetics of tetraphenylethylene simple derivatives, it is shown that process is the almost exclusive nonradiative pathway accounting for their luminescence quenching in solution, while photocyclization plays at best a minor role.







Abstract
Although tetraphenylethylene (TPE) and its derivatives have been the most commonly used building blocks in the construction of molecules with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties, no absolute consensus exists regarding the mechanisms at the origin of the phenomenon. Restriction of intramolecular rotations (RIR) of peripheral phenyls has historically been a dominant paradigm, which has served as a valuable guideline in the molecular engineering of AIEgens. Yet, an increasing number of recent works have established that photoisomerization or photocyclization may actively participate in the nonradiative dissipation of the excitation energy. In this paper, the first experimental evaluation of the quantum efficiencies of these different processes is reported, and photoisomerization is shown to be by far the dominant photophysical pathway in solution, accounting for virtually all nonradiative decay of the molecule&#8216;s excited state in degassed solution.

         <title>Ultrafast Photo&#8208;Ion Probing of the Ring&#8208;Opening Process in Trans&#8208;Stilbene Oxide.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We study the ultrafast photo&#8208;induced ring&#8208;opening process of the oxirane derivative trans&#8208;stilbene oxide through the use of ultrafast UV/UV pump&#8208;probe spectroscopy utilizing photoion detection. We identify the single&#8208; and multiphoton probe paths and final states through comparisons between UV power studies and synchrotron&#8208;based vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) single&#8208;photon ionization studies.&#160; We observe three major time&#8208;dependent features of the parent ion (sub&#8208;450 fs decay, (1.5 &#177; 0.2) ps, and &gt; 100 ps). We discuss these decays in conjunction to the primary ring&#8208;opening mechanism of stilbene oxide that occurs  via  C&#8211;C dissociation in the oxirane ring. We also investigate the appearance of fragments relating to the masses of dehydrogenated diphenylmethane (167 amu) and dehydrogenated methylbenzene (90 amu). The appearance of the 167 amu fragment may suggest an alternative ultrafast ring&#8208;opening pathway  via  the dissociation of one of the C&#8211;O bonds within the oxirane ring</dc:description>

         <title>Simple Synthetic Routes to Carbene&#8208;M&#8208;Amido (M = Cu, Ag, Au) Complexes for Luminescence and Photocatalysis Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of novel and operationally simple synthetic routes to Carbene&#8208;Metal&#8208;Amido (CMA) complexes of copper, silver and gold relevant for photonic applications are reported. A mild base and sustainable solvents allow all operations to be conducted in air and at room temperature, leading to high yields of the targeted compounds even on multigram scales. The effect of various mild bases on the N&#8208;H metallation was studied in silico and experimentally, while a mechanochemical, solvent&#8208;free synthetic approach was also developed. Our photophysical studies on [M(NHC)(Cbz)] indicate that the occurrence of fluorescent or phosphorescent states is determined primarily by the metal, providing control over the excited state properties. Consequently, we demonstrate the potential of the new CMAs beyond luminescence applications by employing a selected CMA as a photocatalyst. The exemplified synthetic ease is expected to accelerate the applications of CMAs in photocatalysis and materials chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Mixed Dimensional Nanostructure (UiO66 decorated MWCNT) as Nanofiller in MMMs for Enhanced CO2/CH4 Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) with combination of two distinct dimensional nanofillers (such as 1D&#8208;3D, 2D&#8208;3D, or 3D&#8208;3D, etc.) have drawn special attention for gas separation applications due to their concerted effects on gas permeation and mechanical properties. Amine functionalized 1D multiwalled carbon nanotube (NH  2  &#8208;MWCNT) holding exceptional mechanical strength and rapid gas transport was cross&#8208;linked with amine functionalized 3D MOF (UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  ) with high CO  2  affinity through Schiff base&#160;reaction. The resultant cross&#8208;linked mixed dimensional nanostructure was used as nanofiller into polysulfone (PSf) polymer matrix to explore the underlying synergy between 1D and 3D nanostructures on gas separation performances of MMMs. Cross&#8208;sectional scanning electron microscopy and mapping micrographs revealed the homogenous dispersion of UiO66@MWCNT into the polymer matrix. The MMM containing 5.0 wt.% UiO&#8208;66@MWCNT demonstrated a superior permeability 8.3 Barrer as compared to 4.2 Barrer of pristine PSf membrane for pure CO  2  . Moreover, the selectivity (CO  2  /CH  4  ) of the same MMM was enhanced to 39.5 from 28.0 observed for pristine PSf&#160;under similar conditions of pressure and temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphorus&#8208;containing Superbases: Recent Progress in the Chemistry of Electron&#8208;abundant Phosphines and Phosphazenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The renaissance of Br&#248;nsted superbases is primarily based on their pronounced capability for a large variety of chemical transformations under mild reaction conditions. Four major set screws are available for the selective tuning of the basicity: the nature of the basic center (N, P, &#8230;), the degree of electron donation by substituents to the central atom, the possibility of charge delocalization, and the energy gain by hydrogen bonding. Within the past decades, a plethora of neutral electron&#8208;rich phosphine and phosphazene bases appeared in the literature. Their outstanding properties and advantages over inorganic or charged bases have made them now indispensable as auxiliary bases in deprotonation processes. Also, their utilization in catalysis or as ligands in coordination chemistry is highlighted due to broad&#8208;spread interest. Here we give an update of the chemistry of basic phosphines and phosphazenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization of Bicontinuous Cubic Phase and its Two&#8208;sided Nature Produced by Use of Siloxane Tails and Introduction of Molecular Nonsymmetry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A recent intriguing finding that a helical network arrangement forms the bicontinuous cubic phase is attracting great attention for its possibility for new routes to asymmetric synthesis by achiral molecules. However, the design of the molecular structure for the cubic phase is still unrevealed. Herein, we show that a nonsymmetric core molecule with larger naphthalene and smaller benzene moieties at each side of the central linkage and the same disiloxanyldecyloxy terminal at both terminals is the first example for forming both single&#8208;layered and double&#8208;layered core assembly modes in the  Ia  3  d  phase as a single molecule system. The molecule forms the former mode at high temperatures as a thermodynamically stable phase, similarly to the symmetric naphthalene core system, whereas, on cooling below a temperature (&#8764;350 K), a metastable  Ia  3  d  phase forms a double&#8208;layered core state down to room temperature, which is common to the benzene core system. As another effect of the nonsymmetric core, the cubic phase is maintained at room temperature for more than 100 days with slight distortion. Infrared spectral studies and quantum chemical calculations suggested the easy transformation between the two core assembly modes. The core nonsymmetry can be a versatile fine&#8208;tuning of the core assembly mode and phase stability for the cubic phase molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis and Bioactivity Mapping of Geodiamolide H</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first total synthesis of the actin&#8208;stabilizing marine natural product geodiamolide H was achieved. Solid&#8208;phase based peptide assembly paired with scalable stereoselective syntheses of polyketide building blocks and an optimized esterification set the stage for investigating the key ring&#8208;closing metathesis. Geodiamolide H and synthetic analogs were characterized for their toxicity and for antiproliferative effects in cellulo, by characterising actin polymerization induction in vitro, and by docking on the F&#8208;actin target and property computation in silico, for a better understanding of structure&#8208;activity relationships (SAR). A non&#8208;natural analog of geodiamolide H was discovered to be most potent in the series, suggesting significant potential for tool compound design.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetrasubstituted Peropyrenes Formed by Reductive Aromatization: Synthesis, Functionalization and Characterization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chromophore class of 1,3,8,10&#8208;tetrasubstituted peropyrenes was effectively synthesized from peropyrenequinone via a Zn&#8208;mediated reductive aromatization approach. In one step, a symmetric functionalization of the peropyrene backbone introducing silylethers (  2  ,  3  ), pivaloyl (  4  ), triflyl (  5  ) and also phosphinite (  6  ) groups was established. Furthermore, the potential of using  4  and  5  in transition metal catalyzed cross couplings was explored leading to 1,3,8,10&#8208;tetraaryl (  8  &#8208;  11  ) and tetraalkynyl (  7  ) peropyrenes. The influence of various substituents on the optoelectronic properties of these &#960;&#8208;system extended peropyrenes was investigated in solid state by means of X&#8208;ray crystallography, in solution by means of UV&#8208;Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy and by their redox properties studied via cyclic voltammetry. By comparison with DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations, it could be elucidated that introduction of a broad variety of substituents in such versatile one or two step procedures leads to peropyrenes with easily tunable HOMO and LUMO energies ranging in a gap window of 0.8 eV. The frontier molecular orbital energies identify the target molecules as promising candidates for hole transporting semiconductors.</dc:description>

The enantioselective reaction required only 0.5 mol % chiral peptide&#8208;catalyst in the presence of  i  Pr  2  EtN (2.5 equiv), and gave a 1,4&#8208;adduct with 93% ee of an 85% yield.

         <dc:description>Heptazine&#8208;based microporous polymeric network, HMP&#8208;TAPA was synthesized via direct coupling of trichloroheptazine and tris(4&#8208;aminophenyl)amine (TAPA). The high surface area of 424 m  2  /g was achieved which is the highest surface area among heptazine&#8208;based polymeric networks (HMPs). The tailored electron&#8208;donor and acceptor units in HMP&#8208;TAPA render the broad visible light absorption. HMP&#8208;TAPA was employed as metal&#8208;free photocatalyst for oxidative coupling of amines to imines under visible light irradiation with 98% selectivity. Furthermore, the surface basicity of HMP&#8208;TAPA was utilized to achieve metal&#8208;free heterogeneous base catalysis for Knoevenagel condensation under base&#8208;free conditions with &gt;99 % conversion. Furthermore, HMP&#8208;TAPA showed extreme robustness over a wide pH range (1&#8208;14). The versatility and flexibility in the current material design is beneficial for understanding the offered photo&#8208;activity and surface basicity to design dual active (photo) catalyst materials for specific applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;free Deoxygenation of Chiral Nitroalkanes: an Easy Entry to &#945;&#8722;substituted Enantiomerically Enriched Nitriles.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A metal&#8208;free, mild and chemodivergent transformation involving nitroalkanes was developed. Under optimized reaction conditions, in the presence of trichlorosilane and a tertiary amine, aliphatic nitroalkanes have been selectively converted into amines or nitriles.

         <title>An NHC&#8208;stabilized phosphinidene for catalytic formylation: A DFT guided approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, applications of low&#8208;valent main group compounds in the field of catalysis is gaining momentum. NHC&#8208;stabilized phosphinidenes owing to the access of two lone pairs of electrons have been found as excellent Lewis bases, however, they are yet to be&#160; used as catalysts.&#160; Herein, we report an NHC stabilized phosphinidene 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;(phenylphosphanylidene)&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole (  1  ) for&#160; the activation of CO  2  . A closer inspection on the CO  2  activation process by DFT calculations along with intrinsic bond orbital analysis unravel that phosphinidene associates with phenylsilane through a non&#8208;covalent &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction between two phenyl rings which activates the Si&#8208;H facilitating its transfer to the CO  2  molecule. Detailed DFT studies along with spectroscopic experiments were combined to understand the mechanism of CO  2  activation and its catalytic reductive functionalization leading to the formylation of a range of chemically inert primary amides under mild reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid Aqueous Synthesis of Large&#8208;size and Edge/Defect&#8208;rich Porous Pd and Pd&#8208;alloyed Nanomesh for Electrocatalytic Ethanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we utilized a facile aqueous synthesis strategy (finished in 5 min at room temperature) to produce large&#8208;size Pd, PdCu, and PdPtCu nanomesh without additional organic ligands or solvent and the volume restriction of reaction solution. The obtained metallic nanomesh possess graphene&#8208;like morphology and a large size of dozens of microns. Abundant edges (coordinatively unsaturated sites, steps, and corners), defects (twins), and mesopores exhibited in the metallic ultrathin structures. The formation mechanism for porous Pd nanomesh disclosed that they undergo the oriented attachment growth along &lt;111&gt; direction. Owing to the structural and compositional advantages, PdCu porous nanomesh with certain elemental ratio (e.g., Pd  87  Cu  13  ) presented enhanced electrocatalytic performance (larger mass activity, better CO tolerance and stability) toward ethanol oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processing of Topochemically Converted Layered WO3 for Multifunctional Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solution processing of nanomaterials is a promising technique to utilize in various applications owing to its simplicity and scalability. However, the studies on liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) of tungsten oxide (WO3) are limited, unlike others due to lack of commercial availability of bulk WO3 with layered structures. Herein, we report a one&#8208;step topochemical synthesis approach to obtain bulk layered WO3 from commercially available layered tungsten disulfide (WS2) by optimizing various parameters like reaction time and temperature. Detailed microscopic and spectroscopic techniques have confirmed the conversion process. Further, LPE has been carried out on topochemically converted bulk layered WO3 in twenty&#8208;two different solvents, and among studied solvents isopropyl alcohol&#8208;water (1:1) co&#8208;solvent system appears to be the best. This indicates that the possible values of surface tension and Hansen solubility parameters for bulk WO3 could be close to that of co&#8208;solvent system. The obtained WO3 dispersions in a low boiling point solvent enable to fabricate thin films with varying thickness using spray deposition method. The obtained thin films are used as active materials in supercapacitors without any conductive additives/binders and exhibited an areal capacitance of 31.7 mF cm&#8208;2 at 5 mV s&#8208;1. The photoelectrochemical measurements reveal that these thin films can also be used as photoanodes for photoelectrochemical water oxidation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A library of gold(I) chloride complexes with phosphine ligands incorporating pendant (thio)urea and squaramide H&#8208;bond donors was prepared with the aim of promoting chloride abstraction from Au(I) via H&#8208;bonding. In the absence of silver additives, complexes bearing squaramides and trifluoromethylated aromatic ureas displayed good catalytic activity in the cyclization of N&#8208;propargyl benzamides, as well as in a 1,6&#8208;enyne cycloisomerization, a tandem cyclization&#8208;indole addition reaction and the hydrohydrazination of phenylacetylene. Kinetic studies and DFT calculations indicate that the energetic span of the reaction is accounted by both the chloride abstraction step, facilitated by the bidentate H&#8208;bond donor via an associative mechanism, and the subsequent cyclization step.</dc:description>

         <title>The Stronger the Better: Donor Substituents Push Catalytic Activity of Molecular Chromium Olefin Polymerization Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The donor strength of bifunctional pyridine&#8208;cyclopentadienyl ligands was altered systematically by the introduction of donating groups in the  para  &#8208;position of the pyridine. In the resulting chromium complexes an almost linear correlation between donor strength and the nitrogen&#8208;chromium distance as well as the electronic absorption maximum is experimentally observed. The connection of electron&#8208;donating groups in the ligand backbone leads to an efficient transfer of the electronic influences to the catalytically active metal center without restricting it through steric effects. Therefore, catalytic olefin polymerization activity, which is already very high for the previously studied catalysts, increase considerably by attaching para&#8208;amino groups to the chelating pyridine or quinoline, respectively. Combining electron rich indenyl ligands with para&#8208;amino substituted pyridines lead to the highest catalytic activities observed so far for this class of organo chromium olefin polymerisation catalysts. The resulting polymers are of ultra high molecular weight and the ability of the catalysts to incorporate co&#8208;monomer is also very high.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The donor strength of bifunctional pyridine-cyclopentadienyl ligands was altered systematically by the introduction of donating groups in the  para  -position of the pyridine. In the resulting chromium complexes an almost linear correlation between donor strength and the nitrogen-chromium distance as well as the electronic absorption maximum is experimentally observed. The connection of electron-donating groups in the ligand backbone leads to an efficient transfer of the electronic influences to the catalytically active metal center without restricting it through steric effects. Therefore, catalytic olefin polymerization activity, which is already very high for the previously studied catalysts, increase considerably by attaching para-amino groups to the chelating pyridine or quinoline, respectively. Combining electron rich indenyl ligands with para-amino substituted pyridines lead to the highest catalytic activities observed so far for this class of organo chromium olefin polymerisation catalysts. The resulting polymers are of ultra high molecular weight and the ability of the catalysts to incorporate co-monomer is also very high.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual Plasmonic Au&#8211;Cu2&#8211;xS Nanocomposites: Design Strategies and Photothermal Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coupling two different materials to create a hybrid nanostructured system is a powerful strategy for achieving synergistically enhanced properties and advanced functionalities. In the case of Au and Cu  2&#8211;  x  S, their combination at the nanoscale results in dual plasmonic Au&#8211;Cu  2&#8211;  x  S nanocomposites that exhibit intense photon absorption in both the visible and the near&#8208;infrared spectral range. Their strong light&#8208;absorbing property translates to superior photothermal transduction efficiency, rendering them attractive in photothermal&#8208;based applications. There are several nanostructure configurations that are possible for the Au&#8211;Cu  2&#8211;  x  S system, and the successful fabrication of a particular architecture often requires a carefully planned synthetic strategy. In this Minireview, we present the different synthetic approaches that can be employed to produce rationally designed Au&#8211;Cu  2&#8211;  x  S nanocomposites, with focus on the experimental protocols that can lead to heterodimer, core&#8722;shell, reverse core&#8722;shell, and yolk&#8722;shell configurations. We also discuss the photothermal behavior of these materials and provide a glimpse of their potential use as photothermally active agents in therapeutic and theranostic applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;resorcin[4]arene&#8208;based inorganic&#8722;organic complexes are a kind of potential multifunctional materials for their adjustable structures and diverse functions. They have potentials applications for lithium ion batteries (LIBs). Additionally, the relationship between different coordinated metal ions and electrochemical performance was also rarely investigated. Herein, three functionalized POM&#8208;resorcin[4]arene&#8208;based inorganic&#8722;organic materials, [Co2(TMR4A)2(H2O)10][SiW12O40]&#183;2EtOH&#183;4.5H2O (1), [Ni2(TMR4A)2(H2O)10][SiW12O40]&#183;4EtOH&#183;13H2O (2) and [Zn2(TMR4A)2(H2O)10][SiW12O40]&#183;2EtOH&#183;2H2O (3), have been synthesized. Further, to enhance the conductivities of these compounds, 1&#8208;3 were doped with reduced graphene oxide (RGO) to gain composites 1@RGO&#8208;3@RGO, respectively. As anode materials for LIBs, 1@RGO&#8208;3@RGO can deliver very high discharge capacities (1445.9, 1285.0 and 1095.3 mAh g&#8722;1, respectively) in the initial run, and show the discharge capacities of 898, 665 and 651 mAh g&#8722;1 at the current density of 0.1 A g&#8722;1 over 100 runs, respectively. More importantly, the discharge capacities of 319, 283 and 329 mAh g&#8722;1 were still maintained for 1@RGO&#8208;3@RGO even after 400 cycles at the large current density (1 A g&#8722;1).</dc:description>

         <title>A Disulfide Switch Providing Absolute Handedness Control in Double Helices via Conversion from the Antiparallel to Parallel Helical Pattern</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A strategy to reversibly switch the parallel/antiparallel helical conformation of aromatic double helices through the formation/breakage of a disulfide bond is presented. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures, NMR, and circular dichroism spectroscopy demonstrate that the double helices with terminal thiol groups favor an antiparallel helical arrangement both in the solid state and in solution, while the  P  /  M  bias of helicity induced by chiral segments from another extremity of the sequence is weak in this structural motif. The antiparallel helices can be rearranged to parallel helices through the disulfide connection of the sequences. This in turn enhances the bias of helical handedness and results in absolute chirality control of the double helices. The handedness mediated process can be governed by the oxidation&#8208;reduction cycle, thereby switching the structural arrangement and the enhancement of chiral bias. In addition, we find that the sequences can dimerize into an intermolecular double helix with the disulfide connection. And the helical handedness is also fully controlled due to the head&#8208;to&#8208;head structural motif.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Coupling of Polyfluorinated Arenes and Functionalized, Masked Aryl Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A chemoselective C(sp2)&#8211;C(sp2) coupling of sufficiently electron&#8208;deficient fluorinated arenes and functionalized N&#8208;aryl&#8208;N&#8217;&#8208;silyldiazenes as masked aryl nucleophiles is reported. The fluoride&#8208;promoted transformation involves the in&#8208;situ generation of the aryl nucleophile decorated with various sensitive functional groups followed by a stepwise nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr). These reactions typically proceed at room temperature within minutes. This catalytic process allows for the functionalization of both coupling partners, furnishing highly fluorinated biaryls in good yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Active Halogen Bonding and Chalcogen Bonding Chloride Transporters with Non&#8208;Protonophoric Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic anion transporters show much promise as potential anti&#8208;cancer agents and therapeutics for diseases associated with mis&#8208;regulation of protein anion channels. In such applications high activity and anion selectivity are crucial to overcome competing proton or hydroxide transport which dissipates cellular pH gradients. Here we report highly active bidentate halogen bonding and chalcogen bonding anion carriers based on electron deficient iodo&#8208; and telluromethyl&#8208;triazole derivatives. Anion transport experiments in lipid bilayer vesicles reveal record nanomolar chloride transport activity for the bidentate halogen bonding anion carrier, and remarkably high chloride over proton/hydroxide selectivity for the chalcogen bonding anionophore. Computational studies provide further insight into the role of sigma&#8208;hole mediated anion recognition and desolvation at the membrane interface. Comparison with hydrogen bonding analogues demonstrates the importance of employing sigma&#8208;hole donor motifs in synthetic anionophores for achieving both high transport activity and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Anomeric and Enantiomeric 2&#8217;&#8208;Deoxycytidines: Base Pair Stability in the Absence and Presence of Silver Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>12&#8208;mer duplex DNA containing anomeric (&#945;/&#946;&#8208;D) and enantiomeric (&#946;&#8208;L/&#946;&#8208;D) 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxycytidine mismatches was studied with respect to base pair stability in the absence and presence of silver ions. Stable duplexes with silver&#8208;mediated cytosine&#8208;cytosine pairs were formed by all anomeric and enantiomeric combinations. Stability changes were observed depending on the composition of the mismatches. Most strikingly, the new silver&#8208;mediated base pair of anomeric &#945;&#8208;D&#8208;dC with enantiomeric &#946;&#8208;L&#8208;dC is superior to the well&#8208;noted &#946;&#8208;D/&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;dC pair in view of stability.

         <title>Relevance of &#960;&#8208;Backbonding for the Reactivity of Electrophilic Anions [B12X11]&#8208; (X&#160;=&#160;F, Cl, Br, I, CN)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrophilic anions of type [B12X11]&#8208;  posses a vacant positive boron binding site within the anion. In a comparatitve experimental and theoretical study the reactivity of [B12X11]&#8208;  with X&#160;=&#160;F, Cl, Br, I, CN is characterized towards different nucleophiles: (i) noble gases (NGs) as &#963;&#8208;donors and (ii) CO/N2  as &#963;&#8208;donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptors. Temperature&#8208;dependent formation of [B12X11NG]&#8208;  indicate the enthalpy order (X&#160;=&#160;CN)&#160;&gt;&#160;(X&#160;=&#160;Cl) &#8776;&#160;(X&#160;=&#160;Br)&#160;&gt;&#160;(X&#160;=&#160;I) &#8776;&#160;(X&#160;=&#160;F) almost independent of the NG in good agreement with calculated trends. The observed order is explained by an interplay of the electron deficiency of the vacant boron site in [B12X11  ]&#8208;  and steric effects. The binding of CO and N2  to [B12X11  ]&#8208;  is significantly stronger. The B3LYP 0K attachment enthapies follow the order (X=F) &gt;&#160;(X=CN) &gt; (X=Cl) &gt; (X=Br) &gt; (X=I), in contrats to the NG series. The bonding motifs of [B12X11CO]&#8208;  and [B12X11N2  ]&#8208;  were characterized using cryogenic ion trap vibrational spectroscopy by focusing on the CO and N2  stretching frequencies &#957;CO  and &#957;N2  , respectively. Observed shifts of &#957;CO  and &#957;N2  are explained by an interplay between electrostatic effects (blue shift), due to the positive partial charge, and by &#960;&#8208;backdonation (red shift). Energy decomposition analysis and analysis of natural orbitals for chemical valence support all conclusions based on the experimental results. This establishes a rational understanding of [B12X11]&#8208;  reactivety dependent on the substituent X and provides first systematic data on &#960;&#8208;backdonation from delocalized &#963;&#8208;electron systems of  closo  &#8208;borate anions.</dc:description>

         <title>Fabrication of Pd/Mg2P2O7 via a Struvite&#8208;template Way from Wastewater and Application as Chemoselective Catalyst in Hydrogenation of Nitroarenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly efficient heterogeneous catalyst Pd/ Mg  2  P  2  O  7&#160;  was fabricated by combining palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) and mesoporous Mg  2  P  2  O  7  fibers/rods. The Mg  2  P  2  O  7  fibers with ultra high specific surface area were prepared from struvite as templates which were synthesized from wastewater consisting of N&#8208; and P&#8208;containing pollutants. This strategy provided a novel pathway in developing advanced catalysts from eutrophication polluted water. The composite Pd/Mg  2  P  2  O  7  showed brilliant performance in selective hydrogenation of nitro&#8208;aromatics to get anilines. As an example of nitrobenzene hydrogenation, the conversion and selectivity to aniline were found to reach almost 100% at temperature of T=90&#176;C and under pressure of P  H2  =2.0 MPa. The superior performance was found to originate from Pd NPs which were boosted by electron transfer afforded by the nano&#8208;fibers Mg  2  P  2  O  7  supports. The favorable adsorption of withdrawing groups (&#8208;NO  2  ) was realized by synergistic effects between Pd and oxygen vacancies provided by pyrolysis of struvite. The catalyst remained stably after cycles of reuse with little degradation in catalysis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Efficient methods for the synthesis of fluorinated compounds have been intensively studied, recently. Development of practical fluorinating reagents is indispensable for this purpose. Herein, bench&#8208;stable electrophilic fluorinating reagents were synthesized as  N  &#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI) substitutes. Reagents obtained by replacing one of the NFSI sulfonyl groups with an acyl group led to the highly selective monofluorination of silyl enol ethers with suppression of undesired overreaction, that is difluorination. On the other hand, reagents bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents at NFSI benzenesulfonyl groups efficiently facilitated the difluorination of silyl enol ethers under base&#8208;free conditions. Thus, both mono&#8208; and difluorinated target materials were prepared from the same substrate.</dc:description>

         <title>Gelatin&#8208;derived 1&#8208;D Carbon Nanofiber Architecture with Simultaneous Decoration of Single Fe&#8208;Nx Sites and Fe/Fe3C Nanoparticles for Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>

         <dc:description>Exploring high&#8208;performance non&#8208;precious metal electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is critical. Herein, we report a scalable and cost&#8208;effective strategy for the construction of one&#8208;dimensional (1&#8208;D) carbon nanofiber architecture with simultaneous decoration of single Fe&#8208;Nx sites and highly dispersed Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles for efficient ORR, through the Fe(III) complex assisted&#8208;electrospinning of gelatin nanofibers with subsequent pre&#8208;oxidation and carbonization. Results show that the presence of Fe(III) complex enables the 1&#8208;D gelatin nanofibers to be well retained during the pre&#8208;oxidation process. Owing to the distinct 1&#8208;D nanofiber structure and the synergistic effect of Fe/Fe3C and Fe&#8208;Nx sites, the resulting electrocatalyst is highly active for ORR with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.885 V (outperforming commercial Pt/C) and a superior electrochemical stability in alkaline electrolyte. Similarly, it also shows a high power density (144.7 mW cm&#8208;2) and a superior stability in Zn&#8208;air battery. This work opens a path for the design and synthesis of 1&#8208;D carbon electrocatalyst for efficient ORR catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Rethinking Borole Cycloaddition Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boroles are attracting broad interest for their myriad and diverse applications, including in synthesis, small&#8208;molecule activation and functional materials. Their properties and reactivity are closely linked to the cyclic conjugated diene system, which has been shown to participate in cycloaddition reactions, such as the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with alkynes. The reaction steps leading to boranorbornadienes, borepins and tricyclic boracyclohexenes from the thermal reaction of boroles with alkynes are seemingly well understood as judged from the literature. Herein, we question the long&#8208;established mechanistic picture of pericyclic rearrangements by demonstrating that seven&#8208;membered borepins (i.e. heptaphenylborepin and two derivatives substituted with a thienyl and chloride substituent on boron) exist in a dynamic equilibrium with the corresponding bicyclic boranorbornadienes, the direct Diels&#8208;Alder products, but are not isolable products from the reactions. Heating gradually converts the isomeric mixtures into fluorescent tricyclic boracyclohexenes, the most stable isomers in the series. Results from mechanistic DFT calculations reveal that the tricyclic compounds derive from the boranorbornadienes and not the borepins, which were previously believed to be intermediates in purely pericyclic processes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Redox&#8208;active Tetrazine&#8208;based Pincer Ligand for the Reduction of N&#8208;oxyanions Using a Redox&#8208;inert Metal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction chemistry of the bis&#8208;tetrazinyl pyridine ligand (btzp) towards nitrogen oxyanions coordinated to zinc is studied in order to explore the reduction of the NO  x  &#713; substrates with a redox&#8208;active ligand in the absence of redox activity at the metal. Following syntheses and characterization of (btzp)ZnX  2  for X = Cl, NO  3  and NO  2  , featuring O&#8208;Zn linkage of both nitrogen oxyanions, it is shown that a silylating agent selectively delivers silyl substituents to tetrazine nitrogens, without reductive deoxygenation of NO  x  &#8208;1  . A new synthesis of the highly hydrogenated H  4  btzp, containing two dihydrotetrazine reductants is described as is the synthesis and characterization of (H  4  btzp)ZnX  2  for X = Cl and NO  3  , both of which show considerable hydrogen bonding potential of the dihydrotetrazine ring NH groups. The (H  4  btzp)ZnCl  2  complex does not bind zinc in the pincer pocket, but instead H  4  btzp becomes a bridge between neighboring atoms through tetrazine nitrogen atoms, forming a polymeric chain. The reaction of AgNO  2  with (H  4  btzp)ZnCl  2  is shown to proceed with fast nitrite deoxygenation, yielding water and free NO. Half of the H  4  btzp reducing equivalents form Ag  0  and thus the chloride ligand remains coordinated to the zinc metal center to yield (btzp)ZnCl  2  . To compare with AgNO  2  , experiments of (H  4  btzp)ZnCl  2  with NaNO  2  result in salt metathesis between chloride and nitrite, highlighting the importance of a redox&#8208;active cation in the reduction of nitrite to NO.</dc:description>

         <title>Upper Critical Solution Temperature&#8208;Type Responsive Cyclodextrins with Characteristic Inclusion Abilities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water&#8208;soluble and thermoresponsive macrocycles with stable inclusion toward guests are highly valuable to construct stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular materials for versatile applications. Here, we develop such macrocycles, ureido&#8208;substituted cyclodextrins (CDs) which exhibit unprecedented upper critical solution temperature (UCST) behavior in aqueous media. These novel CD derivatives showed good solubility in water at elevated temperature, but collapsed from water to form large coacervates upon cooling to low temperature. Their cloud points are dependent greatly on concentrations, and furthermore, can be mediated through oxidation and chelation with silver ion. Significantly, amphiphilicity of these CD derivatives is supportive to the host&#8208;guest binding, which afford them to retain inclusion abilities to guest dyes. The inclusion complexation remained nearly intact during thermally induced phase transitions, which makes contrast to the switchable inclusion behavior of lower critical solution temperature (LCST)&#8208;type CDs. Moreover, ureido&#8208;substituted CDs were exploited to coencapsulate a pair of guest dyes whose fluorescence resonance energy transfer process can be switched by the UCST phase transition. We therefore believe this novel thermoresponsive CDs may form a new strategy for developing smart macrocycles and allow for exploring smart supramolecular materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Functional Carbazole&#8208;Fullerene Complexes: A New Perspective of Carbazoles Acting as NanoOctopus to Capture Globular Fullerenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fullerene host&#8208;guest constructs have attracted increasing attention owing to their molecular&#8208;level hybrid arrangements. However, the usage of simple carbazolic derivatives to bind with fullerenes is rare. In this research, we rationally designed three novel carbazolic derivatives containing a tunable bridging linker and carbazole units for the capturing of fullerenes. Unlike the general concave&#8208;convex interactions, fullerenes could interact with the planar carbazole subunits to form 2&#8208;dimensional hexagonal/quadrilateral cocrystals with alternating stacking patterns of 1:1 or 1:2 stoichiometry, as well as the controllable fullerene packing modes. At the meanwhile, good electron&#8208;transporting performances and significant photovoltaic effects were realized when continuous C  60  &#183;&#183;&#183;C  60  interaction channel existed. Our results indicate that the introduction of such carbazolic system into fullerene receptor would provide us new insights into novel fullerene host&#8208;guest architectures for versatile applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A heterometallic M&#8208;M' bond formation is a key to construct atomically precise bimetallic clusters and materials.&#160; However, it is sometimes not straightforward to construct a heterometallic M&#8208;M' bond through conventional methods including redox condensation.&#160; Here we found that a sandwich framework of &#960;&#8208;conjugated unsaturated hydrocarbon ligands provides a unique coordination environment that facilitates unusual coupling of d  8  Rh  I  and d  10  M  0  (M = Pd, Pt).&#160; The molecular orbital analysis showed that the electron&#8208;accepting ability of the sandwich framework through back&#8208;donation allows the formation of a d&#963;&#8208;type Rh&#8208;Pd bond in a (d&#8208;d)  18  electron system.</dc:description>

         <title>Merging Molecular Recognition and Gold(I) Catalysis with

Triphoscalix[6]arene Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis and characterization of novel

triphosphine calix[6]arene ligands. These supramolecular wheels,

with recognition features governed by the hydrogen&#8208;bonding domain,

were employed to synthesize multitasking trinuclear gold(I)

complexes as a new platform for the synthesis of interwoven

(pseudo)rotaxanes species. Parallelly, the multivalent, metal&#8208;bonded

upper&#8208;rim displayed catalytic features promoting highly selective gold

catalyzed cycloisomerization reactions of 1,6&#8208;enynes.</dc:description>

         <title>Comparative Investigation into the Complexation and Extraction Properties of Tetradentate and Tridentate Phosphine Oxide Functionalized 1,10&#8208;Phenanthroline Ligands toward Lanthanides and Actinides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two new phosphine oxide functionized 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline ligands, tetradentate 2,9&#8208;bis(butylphenylphosphine oxide)&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (BuPh&#8208;BPPhen, L1) and tridentate 2&#8208;(butylphenylphosphine oxide)&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (BuPh&#8208;MPPhen, L2), were synthesized and studied comparatively for the coordination with trivalent actinides and lanthanides. The complexation mechanisms of these two ligands toward trivalent f&#8208;block elements were thoroughly elucidated by NMR spectroscopy, UV&#8208;vis spectrophotometry, fluorescence spectrometry, single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, solvent extraction, and theoretical calculation methods. NMR titration results demonstrated that both 1:1 and 1:2 (metal to ligand) lanthanides complexes formed for L1 whereas 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3 lanthanide complexes formed for L2 in methanol solution. The formation of these species were also validated by fluorescence spectrometry and the corresponding stability constants for the complexes of Nd(III) with L1 and L2 were determined using UV&#8208;vis spectrophotometry. Structures of the 10&#8208;coordinated 1:1&#8208;type complexes of EuL1(NO3)3 and [EuL2(NO3)3(H2O)]&#8231;Et2O in solid state were characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography. In solvent extraction experiments, L1 exhibited extremely strong extraction ability for both Am(III) and Eu(III) while L2 showed nearly no extraction toward Am(III) and Eu(III) due to its high hydrophilicity. Finally, the structures and bonding natures of those complexes species formed between Am(III)/Eu(III) and L1/L2 were analyzed using DFT calculations.</dc:description>
