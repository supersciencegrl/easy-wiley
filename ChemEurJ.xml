      <title>Hybrid White Light&#8208;Emitting Electrochemical Cells Based on a Blue Cationic Iridium(III) Complex and Red Quantum Dots</title>
      <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state white light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) show promising advantages of simple solution fabrication processes, low operation voltage and compatibility with air&#8208;stable cathode metals, which are required for lighting applications. To date, white LECs based on ionic transition metal complexes (iTMCs) have been shown higher device efficiencies than white LECs employing other types of materials. However, relatively lower emission efficiencies of red iTMCs limit further improvement in device performance. Alternatively, efficient red CdZnSeS/ZnS core&#8208;shell quantum dots are integrated with a blue iTMC to form a hybrid white LEC in this work. With achieving good carrier balance under a proper device architecture, peak external quantum efficiency and power efficiency reach 11.2% and 15.1 lm W  &#8208;1  , respectively. Such device efficiency is indeed higher than those of the reported white LECs employing host&#8208;guest iTMCs. Time and voltage dependent electroluminescent (EL) characteristics of the hybrid white LECs are studied with the evidence of the temporal evolution of emission zone position extracted by fitting the simulated and measured EL spectra. The working principles of the hybrid white LECs are clarified and the high device efficiency renders the proposed new white&#8208;emitting devices suitable for solid&#8208;state lighting technology.</dc:description>

      <title>Enhanced Electrocatalytic Activity of a Zinc Porphyrin for CO2 Reduction: Cooperative Effects of Triazole Units in the Second Coordination Sphere</title>
      <dc:description>The control of the second coordination sphere in a coordination complex plays an important role in improving catalytic efficiency. Herein, we report a zinc porphyrin complex  ZnPor8T  with multiple flexible triazole units comprising the second coordination sphere, as an electrocatalyst for the highly selective electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO  2  ) to carbon monoxide (CO).

      <title>Highly Specific Recognition of Guanosine Using Engineered Base Excised Aptamers</title>
      <dc:description>Purines and their derivatives are highly important molecules in biology for nucleic acids synthesis, energy storage, and signaling. While many DNA aptamers have been obtained for binding adenine derivatives such as adenosine, AMP and ATP, the success for specific binding of guanosine has been limited. Instead of performing new aptamer selections, we report herein a base&#8208;excised strategy to engineer existing aptamers for binding guanosine. Both the Na+&#8208;binding aptamer and classical adenosine aptamer were manipulated as the base&#8208;excising scaffold. A total of seven guanosine aptamers were desined, in which a G16&#8208;deleted Na+&#8208;aptamer showed the highest binidng specificity and affinity for guanoisne, with an apparent Kd of 0.78 mM. Single monophosphate difference was recognizable. Both the aptamer scaffold generality and excised&#8208;site generality were systematically studied. Overall, this work provides a few guanosine binding aptamers by using non&#8208;SELEX method. It also provides deeper insights into engineering aptamers for molecular recognition.</dc:description>

Instead of performing new aptamer selections, we report herein a base&#8208;excised strategy to engineer existing aptamers for binding guanosine. Both the Na+&#8208;binding aptamer and classical adenosine aptamer were manipulated as the base&#8208;excising scaffold. A total of seven guanosine aptamers were desined, in which a G16&#8208;deleted Na+&#8208;aptamer showed the highest binidng specificity and affinity for guanoisne, with an apparent Kd of 0.78 mM. Single monophosphate difference was recognizable. Both the aptamer scaffold generality and excised&#8208;site generality were systematically studied. Overall, this work provides a few guanosine binding aptamers by using non&#8208;SELEX method. It also provides deeper insights into engineering aptamers for molecular recognition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Amphiphilic Polymeric Nanoparticles for Photoredox Catalysis in Water</title>
      <dc:description>
Photoredox catalysis takes a bath: Single&#8208;chain polymeric nanoparticles are utilized as an efficient and recyclable platform to perform photoredox catalysis in water. The reduction of aryl halides and C&#8722;C cross coupling reactions are studied upon UV&#8208;light illumination under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Photoredox catalysis has recently emerged as a powerful synthesis tool in organic and polymer chemistry. In contrast to the great achievements realized in organic solvents, performing photocatalytic processes efficiently in aqueous media encounters several challenges. Here, it is presented how amphiphilic single&#8208;chain polymeric nanoparticles (SCPNs) can be utilized as small reactors to conduct light&#8208;driven chemical reactions in water. By incorporating a phenothiazine (PTH) catalyst into the polymeric scaffold, metal&#8208;free reduction and C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling reactions can be carried out upon exposure to UV light under ambient conditions. The versatility of this approach is underlined by a large substrate scope, tolerance towards oxygen, and excellent recyclability. This approach thereby contributes to a sustainable and green way of implementing photoredox catalysis.

      <title>Modeling the Reaction of Carboxylic Acids and Isonitriles in a Self&#8208;Assembled Capsule</title>
      <dc:description>
Filling the capsule: Reactions of a carboxylic acid with n&#8208;butyl and isopropyl isonitriles in a self&#8208;assembled capsule were investigated by DFT. For R=iPr, the transition state and the product of the final, acyl transfer step are significantly shorter than the preceding intermediate, and this results in energetically unfavorable empty spaces inside the capsule, which cause a higher barrier, whereas for R=nBu the C4 chain can untwine and thus maintain an appropriate guest length.







Abstract
Quantum chemical calculations were used to study the reaction of carboxylic acids with isonitriles inside a resorcinarene&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled capsule. Experimentally, it has been shown that the reactions between p&#8208;tolylacetic acid and n&#8208;butyl isonitrile or isopropyl isonitrile behave differently in the presence of the capsule compared both with each other and also with their solution counterparts. Herein, the reasons for these divergent behaviors are addressed by comparing the detailed energy profiles for the reactions of the two isonitriles inside and outside the capsule. An energy decomposition analysis was conducted to quantify the different factors affecting the reactivity. The calculations reproduce the experimental findings very well. Thus, encapsulation leads to lowering of the energy barrier for the first step of the reaction, the concerted &#945;&#8208;addition and proton transfer, which in solution is rate&#8208;determining, and this explains the rate acceleration observed in the presence of the capsule. The barrier for the final step of the reaction, the 1,3 O&#8594;N acyl transfer, is calculated to be higher with the isopropyl substituent inside the capsule compared with n&#8208;butyl. With the isopropyl substituent, the transition state and the product of this step are significantly shorter than the preceding intermediate, and this results in energetically unfavorable empty spaces inside the capsule, which cause a higher barrier. With the n&#8208;butyl substituent, on the other hand, the carbon chain can untwine and hence uphold an appropriate guest length.

      <dc:description>Graphene oxide (GO)&#8208;grafted nano&#8208;supramolecules have been recently emerged as a neoteric nano&#8208;drug carrier in therapy of refractory diseases. Herein, we reported an original multicomponent nano&#8208;supramolecular drug carrier based on targeted peptide and magnetic GO whose behavior of drug releasing can be regulate by alternating magnetic field (AMF). This multicomponent nano&#8208;supramolecular carrier was composed of &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD)/nickel nanoparticle&#8208;modified graphene oxide (GONiCD) and mitochondrial ion&#8208;targeting peptide (MitP)&#8208;grafted hyaluronic acid (HAMitP). Owing to the host&#8208;guest interaction between &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin and the cyclohexyl groups on MitP, GONiCD and HAMitP could form supramolecular assemblies during the doxorubicin (Dox)&#8208;loading process, not only remarkably enhancing the drug&#8208;loading capacity, but also improving the drug&#8208;releasing efficiency under the stimulus of alternating magnetic field (AMF). During co&#8208;incubation with the tumor cells, the Dox&#8208;loading assemblies could strongly target the tumor mitochondria, and damage both the mitochondria and the nuclei, owing to Dox release from the assemblies induced by AMF. This study sheds a novel light on exploration of peptide caps for controlled drug loading/release of supramolecular nanocarriers for efficiently drug delivery and anti&#8208;cancer therapy.</dc:description>

      <title>A Reversible Liquid to Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carrier System Based on Ethylene Glycol and Ethanol</title>
      <dc:description>Liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) are powerful systems for the efficient unloading and loading molecular hydrogen. Herein, a liquid to liquid organic hydrogen carrier system based on reversible dehydrogenative coupling of ethylene glycol (EG) with ethanol catalysed by ruthenium pincer complexes is reported. Noticeable advantages of the current LOHC system is that both reactants (hydrogen&#8208;rich components) and the produced esters (hydrogen&#8208;lean components) are liquids at room temperature, and the dehydrogenation process can be performed under solvent and base&#8208;free conditions. Moreover, the hydrogenation reaction proceeds under low hydrogen pressure (5 bar), and the LOHC system has a relatively high theoretical gravimetric hydrogen storage capacity (HSC &gt;5), presenting an attractive hydrogen storage system.</dc:description>

      <title>Tuning the ground and excited state dynamics of hemithioindigo molecular motors by substituents</title>
      <dc:description>Efficiency and performance of light triggered molecular motors are crucial features that need to be mechanistically understood in order to improve the performance and enable conscious property tailoring for specific applications. In this work three different hemithioindigo based molecular motors are investigated and all four steps in their complete unidirectional rotation are unraveled fully quantitatively. Transient absorption spectroscopy across twelve orders in magnitude in time is used to probe the fs nuclear motions up to the ms thermal kinetics covering the timeframe of the whole motor rotation. The newly known full mechanism allows simulating the motor system to scrutinize its performance at realistic illumination conditions. This highlights the importance of photoisomerization quantum yields for the rotation speed. The substitution pattern in close proximity to the rotation axle influences the excited and ground state properties. Reduction of electron donation and concomitant increase of steric hindrance leads to faster photoisomerization reactions with quasi&#8208;ballistic behavior, but also to a slight decrease in the quantum efficiency. The expected decelerating effects of increased sterics are primarily manifested in the ground state. A promising approach for next generation hemithioindigo motors is to elevate electron donation at the rotor fragment followed by an increase of steric hindrance.</dc:description>

      <title>The Photoisomerization Pathway(s) of Push&#8208;Pull Phenylazoheteroarenes</title>
      <dc:description>Azoheteroarenes are the most recent derivatives targeted to further improve the properties of azo&#8208;based photoswitches. Their light&#8208;induced mechanism for trans&#8208;cis isomerization is assumed to be very similar to that of the parent azobenzene. As such, they inherited from the controversy about the dominant isomerization pathway (rotation vs. inversion) depending on the excited state (n&#960;* vs. &#960;&#960;*). While the controversy seems settled in azobenzene, the extent to which the same conclusions apply to the more structurally&#8208;diverse family of azoheteroarenes is unclear. Here, we unravel by means of non&#8208;adiabatic molecular dynamics, the photoisomerization mechanism of three prototypical phenyl&#8208;azoheteroarenes with an increasing push&#8208;pull character. The evolution of the rotational and inversion conical intersection energies, the preferred pathway, and the associated kinetics upon both n&#960;* and &#960;&#960;* excitations can be linked directly with the push&#8208;pull substitution effects. Overall, we clarify the working conditions of this family of azo&#8208;dyes and identify a possibility to exploit push&#8208;pull substituents to tune their photoisomerization mechanism, with potential impact on their quantum yield.</dc:description>

      <title>Multiscale approach of spin crossover materials &#8208; a concept mixing Russian dolls and domino effects</title>
      <dc:description>The spin crossover (SCO) phenomenon corresponds to a modification that originates at the atomic scale. However, the simple consideration of the transformations that occur following the SCO at this scale or in its close vicinity does not allow anyone to truly understand, anticipate and thus take advantage of what happens at the scale of the material, and even less at the device one. As the fruit of years of work and experience on this phenomenon, we formalize here the concept of the multiscale understanding of SCO. Clearly, the deflagration generated by the initial impressive atomic modification on all the physical scales of the solid must be understood in terms of structure&#8208;properties relationships that fit together, like Russian dolls, and propagate according to a kind of domino effect. Each scale can both give different and independent consequences from those of the other scales but at the same time can influence those of a larger or smaller scale, the whole being imperatively to take into account. The concept appears well illustrated by the volume modification, always the same at the atomic level but drastically different and adaptable, in amplitude and sense, at any other physical scale. This approach results in a much wider range of potential applications than the atomic level alone initially suggests, including one serious path to shape memory materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Coupling of 1,3&#8208;Dipoles and Boronic Acids as a Sustainable Approach to C&#8722;C Bond Formation</title>
      <dc:description>
A scalable and metal&#8208;free approach to carbon&#8211;carbon bond formation using 1,3&#8208;dipole systems generated from hydrazonyl chloride or hydroxamoyl chloride precursors and aryl boronic acid derivatives is reported. Generation of the 1,3&#8208;dipole results in activation of the boronic acid, with migration of the pendant aryl group to forge a new C&#8722;C bond in yields up to 80&#8201;% (see scheme).







Abstract
The need for alternative, complementary approaches to enable C&#8722;C bond formation within organic chemistry is an on&#8208;going challenge in the area. Of particular relevance are transformations that proceed in the absence of transition&#8208;metal reagents. In the current study, we report a comprehensive investigation of the coupling of nitrile imines and aryl boronic acids as an approach towards sustainable C&#8722;C bond formation. In situ generation of the highly reactive 1,3&#8208;dipole facilitates a Petasis&#8211;Mannich&#8208;type coupling via a nucleophilic boronate complex. The introduction of hydrazonyl chlorides as a complementary nitrile imine source to the 2,5&#8208;tetrazoles previously reported by our laboratory further broadens the scope of the approach. Additionally, we exemplify for the first time the extension of this protocol into another 1,3&#8208;dipole, through the synthesis of aryl ketone oximes from aryl boronic acids and nitrile N&#8208;oxides.

Additionally, we exemplify for the first time the extension of this protocol into another 1,3&#8208;dipole, through the synthesis of aryl ketone oximes from aryl boronic acids and nitrile &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;oxides.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Density Functional Theory Study of Pd Aggregation on a Pyridine&#8208;Terminated Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer</title>
      <dc:description>
How to aggregate: DFT calculations for the initial stage of Pd electrodeposition onto a pyridine&#8208;terminated self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) are reported. By using periodic models and methods comprising standard structure optimization and molecular dynamic simulations, the large energetic driving force for the initial metal aggregation is predicted.







Abstract
By using density functional theory calculations, the initial steps towards Pd metal cluster formation on a pyridine&#8208;terminated self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) consisting of 3&#8208;(4&#8208;(pyridine&#8208;4&#8208;yl)phenyl)propane&#8208;1&#8208;thiol on an Au(1&#8201;1&#8201;1) surface are investigated. Theoretical modelling allows the investigation of structural details of the SAM surface and the metal/SAM interface at the atomic level, which is essential for elucidating the nature of Pd&#8211;SAM and Pd&#8211;Pd interactions at the liquid/solid interface and gaining insight into the mechanism of metal nucleation in the initial stage of electrodeposition. The structural flexibility of SAM molecules was studied first and the most stable conformation was identified, planar molecules in a herringbone packing, as the model for Pd adsorption. Two binding sites are found for Pd atoms on the pyridine end group of the SAM. The strong interaction between Pd atoms and pyridines illustrates the importance of SAM functionalisation in the metal nucleation process. Consistent with an energetic driving force of approximately &#8722;0.3&#8197;eV per Pd atom towards Pd aggregation suggested by static calculations, a spontaneous Pd dimerisation is observed in ab initio molecular dynamic studies of the system. Nudged elastic band calculations suggest a potential route with a low energy barrier of 0.10&#8197;eV for the Pd atom diffusion and then dimerisation on top of the SAM layer.

In this work, we rationally designed and synthesized a small set of four protein fluorogens with red or near&#8208;infrared emission.

      <title>Conformational Sensing by a Mammalian Olfactory Receptor</title>
      <dc:description>
Rotate to activate: Precisely what molecular features do the olfactory GPCRs sense in odorant ligands? The rodent Olfr2 receptor binds aliphatic aldehydes indiscriminately, but conformational restriction experiments on the flexible agonist, octanal, correlates the C5&#8722;C6 rotamer position with different receptor outputs&#8212;activation, partial activation, or antagonism. Thus, an olfactory GPCR can carry out conformational analysis during odor recognition.







Abstract
To identify odors, the mammalian nose deploys hundreds of olfactory receptors (ORs) from the rhodopsin&#8208;like class of the G&#8197;protein&#8208;coupled receptor superfamily. Odorants having multiple rotatable bonds present a problem for the stereochemical shape&#8208;based matching process assumed to govern the sense of smell through OR&#8211;odorant recognition. We conformationally restricted the carbon chain of the odorant octanal to ask whether an OR can respond differently to different odorant conformations. By using calcium imaging to monitor signal transduction in sensory neurons expressing the mouse aldehyde OR, Olfr2, we found that the spatial position of the C7 and C8 carbon atoms of octanal, in relation to its &#8722;CHO group, determines whether an aliphatic aldehyde functions as an agonist, partial agonist or antagonist. Our experiments provide evidence that an odorant can manipulate an OR through its intrinsic conformational repertoire, in unexpected analogy to the photon&#8208;controlled aldehyde manipulation observed in rhodopsin.

      <dc:description>
Single&#8208;ion magnets (SIMs) are magnetic compounds that could retain their magnetization after removing the field but due to noninteracting isolated magnetic ions (as it is illustrated by the figure) instead of domains in classical ferromagnets. Usually they are constructed from metal&#8211;organic complexes of magnetic d or f ions but here, a Minireview of another approach that is using inorganic solid state compounds as a matrix for individual magnetic ions with SIM properties is presented by M.&#8197;A. Zykin et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;8834&#8197;ff.

Usually they are constructed from metal&#8211;organic complexes of magnetic d or f ions but here, a Minireview of another approach that is using inorganic solid state compounds as a matrix for individual magnetic ions with SIM properties is presented by M.&#8197;A. Zykin et&#8197;al. on &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.201905290page&#8197;8834&#8197;ff.&lt;/a&gt;

      <title>Ratiometric Detection of ATP by Fluorescent Cyclophanes with Bellows&#8208;Type Sensing Mechanism</title>
      <dc:description>
The cover feature illustrates the mechanism of ATP detection by a new fluorescent receptor in aqueous solution. The receptor works like bellows: it exists in solution in a stacked form but opens only for binding of ATP. Moreover, the receptor represent an example of a ratiometric probe, which changes its color from yellow to blue upon ATP recognition. Test tubes in the picture display our efforts to separate the pyrene derivatives by column chromatography. More information can be found in the Full Paper by E.&#8197;A. Kataev et&#8197;al.

      <title>Thermal Adaptation of Enzymes: Impacts of Conformational Shifts on Catalytic Activation Energy and Optimum Temperature</title>
      <dc:description>
Evolution has led to conserved enzyme families that efficiently catalyze the same chemical reaction but in radically different thermal environments. In particular, some enzymes need to be stable and to work in very hot conditions that usually lead to protein melting. Using atomistic simulations and analytic modeling, it is shown that the temperature&#8208;dependence of the enzyme accessible conformations plays a key role in the determination of its optimum working temperature, that cannot be predicted from its melting temperature alone.

Bioorthogonal fluorogenic reagents that produce after chemical activation fluorescent products represent superior probes for cellular imaging. Due to the improved signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, they can be applied in no&#8208;wash fluorogenic labeling experiments. The present study reveals a set of coumarin&#8208;tetrazine light&#8208;up probes, which produce bright dyes in reaction with TCO or BCN dienophile&#8208;tagged molecules and enable fast bioorthogonal labeling in live cells.

      <title>Thermal Elimination of Ethylene from Cyclobutyl Groups Characterized by X&#8208;ray Crystallography in a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Matrix
</title>
      <dc:description>
The thermolytic expulsion of ethylene from cyclobutyl rings isolated in a metal&#8211;organic framework matrix delivers vinyl&#8208;substituted aromatic compounds that cannot be prepared by conventional synthetic routes.







Abstract
Methods to synthesize and characterize aromatic molecules with vinyl substituents are sought after yet limited in the literature. Here, we introduce cyclobutyl groups into a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) matrix that are poised to produce ethylene upon heating. The expulsion of ethylene produces vinyl groups on an aromatic core, which are isolated by the crystalline matrix of the framework. This enables full characterization of the thermolysis by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Further, we modify the vinyl groups by a bromine addition reaction. Importantly, the two transformations happen in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal manner without changing the overall network structure of the parent framework. New insights into the structural and synthetic chemistry of this important class of compound are generated. Installing reactive vinyl tags in materials by the high temperature thermolysis of cyclobutyl groups is a powerful strategy for altering their physicochemical characteristics.

      <title>Targeting an Interaction Between Two Disordered Domains by Using a Designed Peptide</title>
      <dc:description>
p53 linkTer is a designed peptide, derived from combining the disordered termini of the p53 linker domain while omitting the connecting loop. The peptide bound the disordered RT loop in iASPP with the same affinity as the parent peptide, without pre&#8208;folding to a defined conformation, and inhibited the interaction between the disordered domains of iASPP and p53, as well as cancer cell death. Omitting the secondary structure from the parent peptide changed its coupled folding and binding mechanism to just binding, suggesting that disorder may be advantageous for interactions.

      <title>Sulfuryl Fluoride Mediated Synthesis of Amides and Amidines from Ketoximes via Beckmann Rearrangement</title>
      <dc:description>
Versatile rearrangement: A mild and practical method for Beckmann rearrangement by using SO2F2 has been developed. In addition to the synthesis of amides, it can be used to convert lignin derivatives into anilines and carboxylic acids, suggesting its application for transforming the waste of paper and pulp industries into useful chemical building blocks. Mechanistic insights allowed employing it for the synthesis of amidines that play vital role in chemistry and biology and which are usually synthesized by harsher methods.







Abstract
A metal&#8208;free and redox&#8208;neutral method for Beckmann rearrangement employing inexpensive and readily available SO2F2 gas is described. The reported transformation proceeds at ambient temperature and is compatible with a wide range of sterically and electronically diverse aromatic, heteroaromatic, aliphatic and lignin&#8208;like oximes providing amides in good to excellent yields. The reaction proceeds through the formation of an imidoyl fluoride intermediate that can also be used for the synthesis of amidines.

      <title>Asymmetric Host Molecule bearing Pyridine Core for Highly Efficient Blue Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence&#8208;OLEDs</title>
      <dc:description>In this study, two host materials, pCzBzbCz  and pCzPybCz  , were synthesized for achieving high efficiency and long lifetime of blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence&#8208;organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (TADF&#8208;OLEDs). The molecular design strategy is conducted by introducing pyridine group into the core structure of pCzPybCz  as an electron&#8208;withdrawing unit and electron&#8208;donating phenyl group into the structure of pCzBzbCz  . These host materials demonstrated good thermal stability and high triplet energy (T 1  = 3.07 eV for pCzBzbCz  and 3.06 eV for pCzPybCz  ) for fabricating blue TADF&#8208;OLEDs.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this study, two host materials, pCzBzbCz  and pCzPybCz  , were synthesized for achieving high efficiency and long lifetime of blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence&#8208;organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (TADF&#8208;OLEDs). The molecular design strategy is conducted by introducing pyridine group into the core structure of pCzPybCz  as an electron&#8208;withdrawing unit and electron&#8208;donating phenyl group into the structure of pCzBzbCz  . These host materials demonstrated good thermal stability and high triplet energy (T 1  = 3.07 eV for pCzBzbCz  and 3.06 eV for pCzPybCz  ) for fabricating blue TADF&#8208;OLEDs. In particular, pCzPybCz  &#8208;based OLED devices demonstrated an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 22.7% and an operational lifetime of 24 h (LT 90  , time to attain 90% of initial luminance) at an initial luminance of 1000 cd m &#8208;2  .

      <dc:description>This study describes the synthesis, structure, and photophysical properties of a new luminescent polyaromatic boronic acid scaffold, diazaboryl&#8208;naphthyl&#8208;ketones (DNKs). These stable compounds display extremely bright fluorescence, aggregation&#8208;induced emission, positive solvatochromism, and solid state fluorescence.

The LUMO energy is lowered, and its shape significantly altered. Photophysical data in solution and the solid state revealed blue&#8208;shifted, narrowed, and intense emissions for DNKs (up to 89% quantum yield). The potential utility of the fluorogenic DNK system was demonstrated with a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for the determination of trace boronic acid contaminants in solid samples, down to one&#8208;ppm level, using HPLC with fluorescence detection.

      <title>Spatiotemporal studies of the one dimensional coordination polymer [Fe(ebtz)2(C2H5CN)2](BF4)2. Tug of war &#8208; nitrile reorientation versus crystal lattice as tool for tuning of spin crossover properties</title>
      <dc:description>Reaction of 1,2&#8208;di(tetrazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethane (ebtz) with Fe(BF4)2&#183;6H2O in different nitriles yields one dimensional coordination polymers [Fe(ebtz)2(RCN)2](BF4)2&#8901;nRCN (n  =2 for R=&#8208;CH3&#160;  (1) and  n=0 for R=&#8208;C2H5&#160;  (2),&#8208;C3H7&#160;  (3),&#8208;C3H5&#160;  (4),&#8208;CH2Cl (5)) exhibiting spin crossover (SCO). SCO in  1  and  3&#8208;5  is complete and occurs above 160 K. In  2  it is shifted to lower temperatures and is accompanied by wide hysteresis (T1/2&#8595;=78 K, T1/2&#8593;=123 K) and proceeds extremely slow. Isothermal (80K) time resolved single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies revealed a complex nature of the HS&#8594;LS transition in  2  . Initial, slow stage is associated with shrinkage of polymeric chains and with reduction of cell volume at 77% (in relation to difference between cell volumes VHS  &#8208;VLS  ) whereas only 16% of iron(II) ions changed spin state. In the second stage an abrupt SCO commences, associated with breathing of crystal lattice along direction of Fe&#8208;nitrile bonds, while the nitriles reorient. HS&#8594;LS switching triggered by light (808 nm) reveals the coupling of spin state and nitrile orientation. The importance of this coupling was confirmed by studies of [Fe(ebtz)2(C2H5CN/C3H7CN)2  ](BF4)2  mixed crystals (2a,  2b), showing a shift of T1/2  to higher values and narrowing of the hysteresis loop occurring together with an increase of fraction of butyronitrile. This increase reduces the capability of nitriles molecules to reorient. Density functional theory (DFT) studies of models of  1&#8208;5  suggest a particular possibility of  2  to adopt a low (140&#8208;145&#176;) value of its Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C(propionitrile) angle.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Reaction of 1,2&#8208;di(tetrazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethane (ebtz) with Fe(BF4)2&#183;6H2O in different nitriles yields one dimensional coordination polymers [Fe(ebtz)2(RCN)2](BF4)2&#8901;nRCN (n  =2 for R=&#8208;CH3&#160;  (1) and  n=0 for R=&#8208;C2H5&#160;  (2),&#8208;C3H7&#160;  (3),&#8208;C3H5&#160;  (4),&#8208;CH2Cl (5)) exhibiting spin crossover (SCO). SCO in  1  and  3&#8208;5  is complete and occurs above 160 K. In  2  it is shifted to lower temperatures and is accompanied by wide hysteresis (T1/2&#8595;=78 K, T1/2&#8593;=123 K) and proceeds extremely slow. Isothermal (80K) time resolved single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies revealed a complex nature of the HS&#8594;LS transition in  2  . Initial, slow stage is associated with shrinkage of polymeric chains and with reduction of cell volume at 77% (in relation to difference between cell volumes VHS  &#8208;VLS  ) whereas only 16% of iron(II) ions changed spin state. In the second stage an abrupt SCO commences, associated with breathing of crystal lattice along direction of Fe&#8208;nitrile bonds, while the nitriles reorient. HS&#8594;LS switching triggered by light (808 nm) reveals the coupling of spin state and nitrile orientation. The importance of this coupling was confirmed by studies of [Fe(ebtz)2(C2H5CN/C3H7CN)2  ](BF4)2  mixed crystals (2a,  2b), showing a shift of T1/2  to higher values and narrowing of the hysteresis loop occurring together with an increase of fraction of butyronitrile. This increase reduces the capability of nitriles molecules to reorient. Density functional theory (DFT) studies of models of  1&#8208;5  suggest a particular possibility of  2  to adopt a low (140&#8208;145&#176;) value of its Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C(propionitrile) angle.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Enhanced Performance of Zirconium&#8208;Doped Ceria Catalysts for the Methoxycarbonylation of Anilines</title>
      <dc:description>The methoxycarbonylation of anilines stands as an attractive method for the phosgene&#8208;free production of carbamates. Despite the high yields reported for ceria as catalyst, the reduction of the amount of side products and the prevention of catalyst deactivation still represent major hurdles in this chemistry. One advantage of ceria is the possibility of tuning its reactivity by doping its lattice with other metals. A series of doped ceria&#8208;based materials, prepared by substitution with metals, are evaluated in the methoxycarbonylation of 2,4&#8208;diaminotoluene with dimethylcarbonate. Among all catalysts, containing Eu, Hf, La, Pr, Sm, Tb, Y or Zr oxides, ceria with 2 mol% ZrO2 exhibited 96% selectivity towards the desired carbamates, improving the CeO2 catalyst. Density functional theory demonstrates that two descriptors are needed: (i) a geometric factor that governs the reduction of energy barriers for carbamate formation through ureas; (ii) catalyst basicity as N&#8208;H bonds need to be activated. Assessment in subsequent reaction cycles revealed that the CeO2/ZrO2 catalyst is more stable than bulk CeO2, along with the reduction of fouling processes.</dc:description>

      <title>Isolated Cobalt Ions Embedded in Magnesium Oxide Nanostructures: Spectroscopic Properties and Redox Activity</title>
      <dc:description>Atomic dispersion of dopants and control over their defect chemistry are central goals in the development of oxide nanoparticles for functional materials with dedicated electronic, optical or magnetic properties.

      <title>Selective hydrolysis of terminal glycosidic bond in &#945;&#8208;1&#8208;acid glycoprotein promoted by Keggin and Wells&#8208;Dawson type heteropolyacids</title>
      <dc:description>The reactivity of a range of Keggin and Wells&#8208;Dawson type heteropolyacids (HPAs): H3PW12O40 H4SiW12O40, H3PMo12O40, K6P2W18O62, and NaH2W12O4, towards the heavily glycosylated &#945;&#8208;1&#8208;acid glycoprotein (AGP) is reported. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS&#8208;PAGE) and high&#8208;performance anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC&#8208;PAD) show that after incubation of the protein with HPAs at 80 &#176;C and pH 2.8 complete hydrolysis of terminal glycosidic bond has been achieved, resulting in the removal of sialic acids with no observed destruction of the protein core or the residual glycan chains. The 1H NMR spectroscopy confirmed that the released sialic acids preserve intact structure upon their excision from the protein, which makes the reported method suitable for the analysis of sialic acid modifications which play an important role in numerous biological processes. The presence of other sugars was not detected by 1H NMR and HPAEC&#8208;PAD, suggesting that HPAs hydrolyze only the terminal glycosidic bond in the glycoprotein, resulting in the selective release of sialic acid from AGP. The observed rate constants were in the range 6,7 x 10&#8208;2 &#8208;11,9 x 10&#8208;2 min&#8208;1 and the complete and selective excision of sialic acids could be achieved within 60 min of incubation. The Trp fluorescence and CD spectroscopy show that non&#8208;covalent interaction between HPA and protein takes place in solution which could lead to stabilization of the sialosyl cation that is formed during the glycosidic bond hydrolysis by anionic HPA cluster.</dc:description>

The framework possesses three types of interlinked cages decorated by rich functional sites, and reveals not only high adsorption capacity for C2H2 but also excellent selective separation for C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/CH4 at 298 K. Dynamic breakthrough experiments on C2H2/CO2 (1:1) mixture and C2H2/CH4 (1:1) mixture also demonstrated the potential of the material to separate C2H2 from CO2 or CH4 mixtures.

      <title>Structures and Chemical Bonding in Antimony(III) Bromide complexes with Pyridine</title>

      <title>DNA alkylation of the RUNX&#8208;binding sequence by CBI&#8208;PI polyamide comjugates</title>
      <dc:description>Many types of molecular targeted drugs that inhibit cancer growth by acting on specific molecules have been developed. The runt&#8208;related transcription factor (RUNX) family, which induces cancer development by binding to a specific DNA sequence, has attracted attention as a new target for cancer treatment. We have developed Chb&#8208;M &#162; , which targets the RUNX&#8208;binding sequence. Chb&#8208;M &#162; was developed by conjugating pyrrole&#8211;imidazole (PI) polyamides and chlorambucil as an anticancer agent. It was recently reported that Chb&#8208;M &#162; had a remarkable anticancer effect in vivo. In this study, to explore the possibility of an alternative structure, we designed a new series of CBI&#8211;PI polyamides, in which seco&#8208;CBI was applied as a DNA&#8208;alkylating agent. We examined the characteristics of the CBI&#8211;PI polyamides targeting the RUNX&#8208;binding sequence and found that these conjugates have great potential for cancer treatment.</dc:description>

      <title>Selective phase transfer reagents (OxP&#8208;crowns) for chromogenic detection of nitrates especially ammonium nitrate</title>
      <dc:description>Nitrogen and phosphorus&#8208;containing ions such as ammonium, nitrates and phosphates are anthropogenic pollutants while ammonium nitrate may be diverted for nefarious purposes in improvised explosive devices. Crown ether&#8208;oxoporphyrinogen conjugates (OxP&#8208;crowns) are used to selectively detect nitrates, especially their ion pairs with K+ and NH4+, based on ion pair complexation of OxP&#8208;crowns under phase transfer conditions. The presence of phosphate and carbonate lead to deprotonation of OxP&#8208;crowns. OxP&#8208;1N18C6 is capable of extracting ion pairs with nitrate from aqueous phase leading to a selective chromogenic response. Deprotonation of the OxP moiety leads to [OxP&#8208;]&#8208;1N18C6[K+] and is promoted by crown ether selective cation binding coupled with hydration of basic oxoanions, which are constrained to remain in the aqueous phase. This work illustrates the utility of molecular design to exploit partitioning and ion hydration effects establishing selectivity of chromogenic response.</dc:description>

      <title>Trifluoromethylation of [AuF3(SIMes)]: Preparation and Characterization of [Au(CF3)xF3&#8722;x(SIMes)] (x = 1 &#8211; 3) Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>Trifluoromethylation of [AuF  3  (SIMes)] with the Ruppert&#8208;Prakash reagent TMSCF  3  in the presence of CsF yields the product series [Au(CF  3  )  x  F  3&#8211;  x  (SIMes)] (  x  = 1 &#8211; 3). The degree of trifluoro&#8208;methylation is solvent dependent and the ratio of the species can be controlled by varying the stoichiometry of the reaction, as evidenced from the  19  F NMR spectra of the corresponding reaction mixtures. The molecular structures in the solid state of  trans  &#8208;[Au(CF  3  )F  2  (SIMes)] and [Au(CF  3  )  3  (SIMes)] are presented, together with a selective route for the synthesis of the latter complex.

      <title>Electrophilicity Scale of Activated Amides: 17O NMR and 15N NMR Chemical Shifts of Acyclic Twisted Amides in N&#8211;C(O) Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
      <dc:description>The structure and properties of amides are of tremendous interest in organic synthesis and biochemistry. Traditional amides are planar and the carbonyl group non&#8208;electrophilic due to nN &#8594; p*C=O conjugation. In this study, we report electrophilicity scale by exploiting 17O NMR and 15N NMR chemical shifts of acyclic twisted and destabilized acyclic amides that have recently received major attention as precursors in N&#8211;C(O) cross&#8208;coupling by selective oxidative addition as well as precursors in electrophilic activation of N&#8211;C(O) bonds. Most crucially, we demonstrate that acyclic twisted amides feature electrophilicity of the carbonyl group that ranges between that of acid anhydrides and acid chlorides. Furthermore, a wide range of electrophilic amides is possible with gradually varying carbonyl electrophilicity by steric and electronic tuning of amide bond properties. Overall, the study quantifies for the first time that steric and electronic destabilization of the amide bond in common acyclic amides renders the amide bond as electrophilic as acid anhydrides and chlorides. These findings should have major implications on the fundamental properties of amide bonds.</dc:description>

      <title>Modulating Magnetic and Photoluminescence Properties in 2&#8208;aminonicotinate based Bifunctional Coordination Polymers by Merging 3d&#8208;Metal Ions</title>
      <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis and study of bifunctional coordination polymers (CPs) with both, magnetic and photoluminescence properties derived from a heterometallic environment. As a starting point, three isostructural monometallic CPs with [M(&#956;&#8208;2ani)2]n [M(II) = Mn (1Mn), Co (3Co) and Ni (4Ni), 2ani = 2&#8208;aminonicotinate] formula, crystallize as chiral 2D&#8208;layered structures stacked by means of supramolecular interactions. These compounds show high thermal stability in solid state (above 350 &#186;C), despite of which 1Mn in aqueous solution is shown to partially transform into a novel 1D chained CP with [Mn(2ani)2(&#956;&#8208;H2O)2]n (2Mn) formula. A consistent study of the dc magnetic properties of 1Mn, 3Co and 4Ni reveal a spin&#8208;canted structure deriving from antisymmetric antiferromagnetic weak exchanges along the chiral network (as confirmed by DFT calculations) and magnetic anisotropy of the ions, in such a way that the long&#8208;range ordering is observed with variable magnitude for the spin carriers. Moreover, 3Co and 4Ni show no frequency&#8208;dependent ac susceptibility curves under zero dc field, a characteristic behaviour of a glassy state that may be partially supressed for 3Co by applying an external dc field. To overcome the long&#8208;range magnetic ordering, Co(II) ions are diluted in a diamagnetic Zn(II)&#8208;based matrix, which enables the single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) behaviour. Interestingly, this strategy allows obtaining a bifunctional CoxZn1&#8208;x2ani material being imbued with a strong photoluminescent emitting capacity characterized by an intense blue light followed by a green afterglow.</dc:description>

      <title>Parahydrogen&#8208;Induced Polarization of Diethyl Ether Anesthetic</title>
      <dc:description>The growing interest in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for assessing regional lung function relies on the use of nuclear&#8208;spin hyperpolarized gas as a contrast agent. The long gas&#8208;phase lifetimes of hyperpolarized 129Xe make this inhalable contrast agent acceptable for clinical research today despite limitations such as high cost, low throughput of production and challenges of 129Xe imaging on clinical MRI scanners, which are normally equipped with proton detection only. We report on low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;throughput preparation of proton&#8208;hyperpolarized diethyl ether, which can be potentially employed for pulmonary imaging with a non&#8208;toxic, simple, and sensitive overall strategy using proton detection commonly available on all clinical MRI scanners.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The growing interest in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for assessing regional lung function relies on the use of nuclear&#8208;spin hyperpolarized gas as a contrast agent. The long gas&#8208;phase lifetimes of hyperpolarized 129Xe make this inhalable contrast agent acceptable for clinical research today despite limitations such as high cost, low throughput of production and challenges of 129Xe imaging on clinical MRI scanners, which are normally equipped with proton detection only. We report on low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;throughput preparation of proton&#8208;hyperpolarized diethyl ether, which can be potentially employed for pulmonary imaging with a non&#8208;toxic, simple, and sensitive overall strategy using proton detection commonly available on all clinical MRI scanners. Diethyl ether is hyperpolarized by pairwise parahydrogen addition to vinyl ethyl ether and characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Proton polarization levels exceeding 8% are achieved at near complete chemical conversion within seconds, causing the activation of radio amplification by stimulated emission radiation (RASER) throughout detection.

      <title>A Full Li&#8208;S Battery with Ultralow Excessive Li Enabled via Lithiophilic and Sulphilic W2C Modulation</title>
      <dc:description>The practical application of Li&#8208;S batteries demands low cell balance (Li  capacity  /S  capacity  ), which involves uniform Li growth, restrained shuttle effect, and fast redox reaction kinetics of S species simultaneously. Herein, with the aid of W  2  C nanocrystals, a freestanding 3D current collector is applied as both Li and S hosts owing to its lithiophilic and sulphilic property. On the one hand, the highly conductive W  2  C can reduce Li nucleation overpotentials, thus guiding uniform Li nucleation and deposition to suppress Li dendrite growth. On the other hand, the polar W  2  C with catalytic effect can enhance the chemisorption affinity to lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and guarantee fast redox kinetics to restrain S species in cathode region and promote the utilization of S. Surprisingly, a full Li&#8208;S battery with ultralow cell balance of 1.5:1 and high sulfur loading of 6.06 mg cm  &#8208;2  shows obvious redox plateaus of S and maintains high reversible specific capacity of 1020 mAh g  &#8208;1  (6.2 mAh cm  &#8208;2  ) after 200 cycles.

      <title>Shedding light on the origin of the&#8208;solid state luminescence enhancement in butterfly molecules</title>
      <dc:description>Different molecular strategies have been carefully evaluated to produce Solid&#8208;State Luminescence Enhancement (SLE) in compounds that show dark states in solution.

      <title>Self&#8208;Assembly Behavior of Diacetylenic Acid Molecules upon Vapor Deposition: Odd&#8208;Even Effect on the Film Morphology</title>
      <dc:description>A series of linear carboxylic acids containing diacetylenic unit at different positions along the chain (C  12  H  25  (C&#8801;C)  2  (CH  2  )  n  COOH, n = 7&#8208;11) were vacuum&#8208;deposited on clean silicon substrate. Morphologies of the initial films after UV&#8208;irradiation were studied. A clear odd&#8208;even effect on the morphology of initial film was observed in that, depending on the spacer length between the diacetylenic unit and carboxyl head group, rings or dendrites of acid dimer layers were obtained. A molecular dynamic simulation of the aggregation process suggests that two competing intermolecular interactions and thus aggregation directions are involved and modulated by the odd or even carbon chain length. Further modulation of the interaction by substitution of a phenyl group at the terminus of the chain or by changing the carboxyl head group to amidobenzoic acid head group led to similar odd&#8208;even effect but of different dimension or trend, which can be rationalized similarly. These results would open the opportunity to create aligned conjugated polymer chains of different dimensions through self&#8208;assembly for applications in molecular/organic electronics.</dc:description>
