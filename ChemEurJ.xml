         <title>Squaramide&#8208;based Heteroditopic [2]Rotaxanes for Sodium Halide Ion&#8208;pair Recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of squaramide&#8208;based heteroditopic [2]rotaxanes consisting of isophthalamide macrocycle and squaramide axle components are synthesised using an alkali metal cation template&#8208;directed stoppering methodology. This work highlights the unprecedented sodium cation template coordination of the Lewis basic squaramide carbonyls for interlocked structure synthesis. Extensive quantitative 1H&#8208;NMR spectroscopic anion and ion&#8208;pair recognition studies reveal the [2]rotaxane hosts are capable of cooperative sodium halide ion&#8208;pair mechanical bond axle&#8208;macrocycle component recognition, eliciting up to 20&#8208;fold enhancements in binding strengths for bromide and iodide, wherein the Lewis basic carbonyls and Lewis acidic NH hydrogen bond donors of the squaramide axle motif operate as cation and anion receptive sites simultaneously in an ambidentate fashion. Notably, varying the length and nature of the polyether cation binding unit of the macrocycle component dramatically influences the ion&#8208;pair binding affinities of the [2]rotaxanes, even overcoming direct contact NaCl ion&#8208;pair binding modes in polar organic solvents. Furthermore, the cooperative ion&#8208;pair binding properties of the squaramide&#8208;based heteroditopic [2]rotaxanes are exploited to successfully extract solid sodium halide salts into organic media.</dc:description>

         <title>External Flash Generation of Carbenoids Enables Monodeuteration of Dihalomethanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, incorporation of one deuterium atom was achieved by H&#8722;D exchange of one of the two identical methylene protons in various dihalomethanes (halogen = Cl, Br, and I) through a rapid&#8208;mixing microflow reaction of lithium diisopropylamide as a strong base and deuterated methanol as a deuteration reagent. Generation of highly unstable carbenoid intermediate and suppression of its decomposition were successfully controlled under high flow&#8208;rate conditions. Monofunctionalization of diiodomethane afforded various building blocks composed of boryl, stannyl, and silyl groups. The monodeuterated diiodomethane, which served as a deuterated C1 source, was subsequently subjected to diverted functionalization methods to afford various products including biologically important molecules bearing isotope labelling at specific positions and homologation products with monodeuteration.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Engineering in Covalent Organic Polymers for High&#8208;Performance Li&#8208;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries are promising energy storage technology due to their tempting high theoretical capacity and energy density. Nevertheless, the wastage of active materials that originates from the shuttling effect of polysulfides still hinders advancement of Li&#8208;S batteries. The effective design of cathode materials is extremely pivotal to solve this thorny problem. Herein, Surface engineering in covalent organic polymers (COPs) has been performed to investigate the influence of pore wall polarity on the performance of COP&#8208;based cathodes used for Li&#8208;S batteries. With the assistance of experimental investigation and theoretical calculations, performance improvement by increasing pore surface polarity and a synergy effect of the polarized functionalities, along with nano&#8208;confinement effect of the COPs, are disclosed, to which the improved performance of Li&#8208;S batteries including outstanding Coulombic efficiency (99.0%) and extremely low capacity decay (0.08% over 425 cycles at 1.0 C) is attributed. This work not only enlightens the designable synthesis and applications of covalent polymers as polar sulfur hosts with high utilization of active materials, but also provides a feasible guide for the design of effective cathode materials for future advanced Li&#8208;S batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Corrosion engineering towards NiFe&#8208;layered double hydroxide macroporous arrays with enhanced activity and stability for oxygen evolution reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>NiFe&#8208;layered double hydroxide (NiFe&#8208;LDH) is the benchmark catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline medium, however, it is still challenging to improve its activity and stability. Herein, NiFe&#8208;LDH macroporous array electrodes are demonstrated to significantly enhance the activity and stability for oxygen evolution reaction. The electrodes are fabricated by the chemical and electrochemical corrosion process of Ni foam induced by ferric nitrate, hydrochloric acid and oxygen. are prepared by a controllable corrosion strategy for oxygen evolution reaction. By optimizing the amount of iron salt and acid and selecting the appropriate reaction temperature and time, The NiFe&#8208;LDH electrodes only need the overpotential of 180 mV and 248 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2 and 500 mA cm&#8208;2, respectively, and remain highly stable for 1000 h at 500 mA cm&#8208;2. The unique macroporous array not only significantly increases the active area of NiFe&#8208;LDH catalyst, but also creates a stable nanostructure that avoids severe reconstruction.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Promoted Basic Nitrogen Unmasking in Arene Ruthenium Complexes Derived from Z&#8208;configured 2,2'&#8208;Azobispyridine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two novel 2,2'&#8208;azobispyridine derivatives bearing N&#8208;dialkylamino substituents at position 4,4' were synthesized and their E&#8208;Z photoswitching behavior was characterized by combination of 1H&#8208; and 13C&#8208;NMR spectroscopy, UV&#8208;vis absorption and DFT calculations. Both isomers act as ligands towards arene&#8208;Ru(II) centers, leading either to E&#8208;configured 5&#8208;membered chelates (involving coordination of nitrogen atoms from N=N bond and pyridine) or to the uncommon Z&#8208;configured 7&#8208;membered chelates (involving coordination of nitrogen atoms from both pyridines). The latter show good stability in the dark, allowing single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction study to be reported here for the first time. All synthesized Z&#8208;configured arene&#8208;Ru(II) complexes undergo irreversible photo&#8208;isomerization to their corresponding E isomers with rearrangement of their coordination pattern; this property was advantageously exploited for the light&#8208;promoted unmasking of a basic nitrogen atom of the ligand.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable and reusable Fe3O4/ZIF&#8208;8 composite for encapsulation of FDH enzyme in mild conditions applicable to CO2 reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enzymatic reduction of carbon dioxide presents limited applicability due to denaturation and the impossibility of biocatalyst recovery; disadvantages that can be minimized by its immobilization. Here, a recyclable bio&#8208;composed system was constructed by in situ encapsulation in mild conditions of formate dehydrogenase enzyme in the ZIF&#8208;8 metalorganic framework (MOF) in the presence of magnetite. The partial dissolution of ZIF&#8208;8 in the enzyme&#8217;s operation media can be relatively inhibited if the concentration of magnetic support used exceeds 10 mg mL&#8208;1. The bio&#8208;friendly environment for immobilization does not harm the integrity of the biocatalyst while the production of formic acid is improved 3.4&#8208;fold compared to the free enzyme because the MOFs act as a concentrator of the enzymatic cofactor. Furthermore, the bio&#8208;composed system retains 86 % of its activity after a long&#8208;time of 5 cycles, indicating an excellent magnetic recovery capacity and a good reusability.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of C&#8208;Aryl Glycosides by C&#8722;H Functionalization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 32, June 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
C&#8208;aryl glycosides synthesis through C&#8722;H functionalization does not require pre&#8208;functionalization of the substrate, and has high step economy and atomic economy. Therefore, from the perspective of C&#8722;H arylation of glycosides and C&#8722;H glycosylation of arenes, this Concept article systematically summarizes the synthesis strategies of C&#8208;aryl glycosides with different positional selectivity.







Abstract
In recent years, the synthesis of C&#8208;aryl glycosides hrough C&#8722;H functionalization has attracted extensive attention of organic synthesis chemists due to its steps and atomic economy. In this concept, we systematically summarizes the synthesis of C&#8208;aryl glycosides with diverse regioselectivity and diastereoselectivity from the perspective of C&#8722;H arylation of glycosides and C&#8722;H glycosylation of arenes. It can be found that a series of recently developed C&#8722;H glycosylation reactions have higher site&#8208;selectivity and diastereomeric selectivity than Friedel&#8211;Crafts glycosylation reaction. The reaction conditions are milder, which can be compatible with acid&#8208;sensitive protective groups, such as acetals or ketals, and the deprotection is more convenient. It can be seen that there are few reports on remote C&#8722;H glycosylation of aromatic hydrocarbons, which is a new field and needs further research. In addition, C&#8722;H glycosylation has a lot of shortcomings, which need to be further explored: a)&#8197;the precise regulation of stereoselectivity in the reaction process also needs further optimization; b)&#8197;the research on the reaction mechanism is almost limited to DFT calculation, and there is no exact experimental evidence. For key parts, such as the specific reaction mechanism between cyclo&#8208;metal intermediates and glycosyl donors in ortho&#8208;CAr&#8722;H glycosylation is still unclear; c)&#8197;due to the fact that aryl glycoside compounds contain bare hydroxyl groups in practical applications, it is an urgent problem to realize the compatibility of glycoside substrates containing naked hydroxyl groups or to remove the protective groups on hydroxyl groups by a mild and efficient method after the reaction; d) In this rapidly developing field, we need to study a greener, more economical and more practical C&#8722;H glycosylation of arenes in the future, which will be conducive to the synthesis of C&#8208;aryl glycosides with more biological application significance.

         <title>Eletrocarboxylation Reactions Using CO2 Both as Promoter and Carboxylative Reagent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 32, June 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrocarboxylation reaction employs CO2 as a carboxylative reagent to prepare value&#8208;added carboxylic acid via organic electrosynthesis. In some cases, CO2 also acts as a promoter to facilitate the desired reaction. This Concept mainly highlights recent CO2&#8208;promoted electrocarboxylation reactions via CO2&#8901;&#8722; intermediate or transiently protective carboxylation of active intermediate with CO2.







Abstract
Electrocarboxylation reaction, which employs organic electrosynthesis to achieve the utilization of CO2 as a carboxylative reagent, provides a powerful and efficient tool for the preparation of organic carboxylic acid. In some electrocarboxylation reactions, CO2 also acts as a promoter to facilitate the desired reaction. This concept mainly highlights recent CO2&#8208;promoted electrocarboxylation reactions via CO2&#8901;&#8722; intermediate or transiently protective carboxylation of active intermediate with CO2.

         <title>Redox Convergent Synthesis and Reactivity of a Cobalt(III)&#8208;Pentasulfido Compound</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 32, June 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new Co(III)&#8208;pentasulfido compound has been synthesized by a unique redox convergent reaction between two new cobalt(II)&#8208;thiolate compounds and elemental sulfur. Detailed reactivity of the Co(III)&#8208;pentasulfido compound towards reducing agents, phosphines, and proton, and transfer of the coordinated pentasulfido chain to selected organic compounds for the generation of organopolysulfide compounds have been demonstrated.







Abstract
A new mononuclear cobalt(III)&#8208;pentasulfido compound, [(L)Co(S5)] (3) has been synthesized by using a convergent redox reaction between elemental sulfur and two new cobalt(II)&#8208;thiolato compounds, [(L)Co(SR)] (R=Ph, 2&#8201;a; 2,6&#8208;Me2&#8208;C6H4, 2&#8201;b), which in turn were synthesized from a dimeric cobalt(II) complex, [(L)2Co2]2+ (1). Compound 3 features a low&#8208;spin, diamagnetic, Co(III) center with a coordinated pentasulfido (S52&#8722;) chain and has no precedence in the literature. Compound 3 is highly stable towards reduction with a potential of &#8722;1.36&#8197;V (vs. Cp2Fe+/Cp2Fe) and gives back 1 upon chemical/electrochemical reduction. Reaction of 3 with phosphines yields back 1 and phosphine sulfides, while protonation of the coordinated S52&#8722; chain in 3 leads to the formation of 1, elemental sulfur and H2S. Finally, transfer of the coordinated S52&#8722; chain in 3 to selected organic compounds, such as MeI, PhCH2Br and PhCOCl, for the generation of organopolysulfido compounds has been demonstrated.

New molecular scaffolds of phenazine and pyrene are constructed by fusing them with oxanorbornene. The C&#8208;shaped molecules exhibit two interesting &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking modes of phenazine depending on the substituting groups as revealed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The C&#8208; and Z&#8208;shaped diastereomers exhibit almost the same charge transfer absorption and emission including positive solvatochromism, which are independent on the overall molecular geometry.







Abstract
New molecular scaffolds of C&#8208;, Z&#8208; and box&#8208;shaped configurations are constructed by fusing phenazine and pyrene units with oxanorbornene. As revealed by X&#8208;ray crystallography, the C&#8208;shaped molecules exhibit two interesting &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking modes of phenazine depending on the substituting groups, and the box&#8208;shaped molecule accommodates two chloroform molecules in the cavity and forms H&#8208;bonds with another four molecules of chloroform. The C&#8208; and Z&#8208;shaped molecules as a pair of diastereomers exhibit almost the same charge transfer absorption and emission including positive solvatochromism, indicating that the intramolecular charge transfer between pyrene (&#960;&#8208;donor) and phenazine (&#960;&#8208;acceptor) is not dependent on the overall molecular geometry.

Trisubstituted 1,3,5&#8208;tri(benzimidazolyl)benzene derivatives were synthesized from l&#8208;alanine, l&#8208;valine, d&#8208;valine and glycine, and their self&#8208;assembling behavior and stimuli&#8208;response in solution and gel states were evaluated. Circular dichroism/UV&#8208;vis absorption spectroscopic and dynamic light scattering measurements revealed that the compounds formed H&#8208;aggregates via intramolecular hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions in nonpolar solvents such as CHCl3, whereas collapse of the aggregates was confirmed by MeOH addition. Quantum mechanical calculations and molecular dynamics simulations also supported aggregation in CHCl3. Rheological analysis and morphology observation revealed the formation of a fibril like structure by further assembling of aggregates at a high concentration in CHCl3.

         <title>Caffeine Biodegradation by Cytochrome P450 1A2. What Determines the Product Distributions?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 32, June 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT calculations on large P450 enzyme models reproduce experimental product distributions excellently and highlight the second coordination sphere interactions in the protein.







Abstract
Caffeine is a natural compound found in plant seeds that after consumption by humans effects the central nervous system as well as the cardiovascular system. In general, the cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver are involved in the biodegradation of caffeine, which gives paraxanthine, theobromine and theophylline products. There has been debate for many years why multiple products are obtained and how their distributions are determined. To this end we performed a high&#8208;level computational study using a combination of molecular dynamics and quantum mechanical approaches. A series of quantum chemical cluster models on the mechanism of caffeine activation by P450 model complexes give hydrogen atom abstraction barriers that predicts the correct ordering and statistical distribution of products. Our studies highlight that second&#8208;coordination sphere effects and thermochemical properties of the substrate determine the product distributions.

         <title>Mechanisms of the Reaction of Elemental Sulfur and Polysulfides with Cyanide and Phosphines
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 32, June 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive mechanistic picture of the mechanisms of elemental sulfur and polysulfide decomposition is provided through Density Functional Theory calculations. Using cyanide and phosphines as prototypical nucleophiles, it is demonstrated that unimolecular decomposition and nucleophilic attack are the lowest&#8208;energy pathways involved in polysulfide reactivity.







Abstract
The reactions of elemental sulfur (S8) and polysulfides with nucleophiles are relevant to organic synthesis, materials science and biochemistry, but the mechanisms by which they operate are still unknown due to the inherent thermodynamic and kinetic instability of polysulfide intermediates. Using Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations at the &#969;B97X&#8208;D/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pV(T+d)Z/SMD(MeCN) // &#969;B97X&#8208;D/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVDZ/SMD(MeCN) level of theory, we studied the mechanisms behind the reaction of elemental sulfur and polysulfides with cyanide and phosphines, which quantitatively generate the monosulfide products thiocyanate and phosphine sulfides, respectively. All plausible pathways including nucleophilic decomposition, unimolecular decomposition, scrambling reactions, and attack on thiosulfoxides, have been considered to provide the first comprehensive mechanistic picture for this class of reactions. Overall, intramolecular cyclization is identified as the most favorable decomposition pathway for long polysulfides. For short polysulfides, a mixture of unimolecular decomposition, nucleophilic attack, and scrambling pathways can be expected.

         <title>Negative Homotropic Cooperativity in Guest Binding of a Trisporphyrin Double Cleft</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 32, June 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triple&#8208;layered trisporphyrin cleft has two cleft cavities, where electron&#8208;deficient guest molecules are accommodated with a strong negative cooperativity. The first guest binding affects the electronic structure of the rest of the cavity, reducing the electrostatic interaction in the successive guest binding. Thus, the degree of electron deficiencies of the guest molecules determines the extent of the cooperativity in the guest binding.







Abstract
The negative homotropic allostery of a triple&#8208;layered trisporphyrin cleft with two guest binding sites is confirmed. The X&#8208;ray crystal structures of the 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 host&#8208;guest complexes showed that the trisporphyrin accommodated two guest molecules within the cleft through &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and donor&#8208;acceptor interactions. In solution, 1H&#8197;NMR and Job plots showed 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 host&#8208;guest complexes. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and UV/vis absorption spectroscopy were employed to evaluate the binding constants and cooperativities. The guest binding of the trisporphyrin showed negative cooperativity and non&#8208;cooperativity depending on the structures of the guest molecules. The correlations between the interaction parameters (&#945;) and Hill constants were determined. ITC experiments showed that the host&#8208;guest complexation of trisporphyrin with electron&#8208;deficient guests incurred an enthalpy penalty in the successive guest binding process. DFT calculations revealed that binding of the first guest reduced the electron density of the central porphyrin plane, which led to an energetic penalty that weakened the successive binding process.

         <title>Nanoscale Probing of the Supramolecular Assembly in a Two&#8208;Component Gel by Near&#8208;Field Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 32, June 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding the nanoscale interactions: The determination of the secondary structure of supramolecular gels usually refers to the macroscopic material. It is shown that the secondary structure and non&#8208;covalent interactions driving the self&#8208;assembly vary at the nanoscale depending on the configuration of the fibrous network.







Abstract
The design of soft biomaterials requires a deep understanding of molecular self&#8208;assembly. Here a nanoscale infrared (IR) spectroscopy study of a two&#8208;component supramolecular gel is introduced to assess the system's heterogeneity and supramolecular assembly. In contrast to far&#8208;field IR spectroscopy, near&#8208;field IR spectroscopy revealed differences in the secondary structures of the gelator molecules and non&#8208;covalent interactions at three distinct nano&#8208;locations of the gel network. A &#946;&#8208;sheet arrangement is dominant in single and parallel fibres with a small proportion of an &#945;&#8208;helix present, while the molecular assembly derives from strong hydrogen bonding. However, at the crossing point of two fibres, only the &#946;&#8208;sheet motif is observed, with an intense &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking contribution. Near&#8208;field nanospectroscopy can become a powerful tool for the nanoscale distinction of non&#8208;covalent interactions, while it is expected to advance the existing spectroscopic assessments of supramolecular gels.

The square pyramidal geometry in neutral pentavalent dithienophosphole&#8208;based Lewis acids is perturbed to distorted trigonal bipyramidal by implementing bulky substituents. With improved accessibility to the P center, these compounds are capable of mediating hydroboration of the catechol proceeding through umpolung of a hydride to a protonic species.







Abstract
A series of luminescent, neutral pentacoordinate dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;d]phosphole compounds was synthesized by [4+1] cycloaddition of o&#8208;quinones with the corresponding trivalent phospholes. The electronic and geometrical modification of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated scaffold implemented here impacts the aggregation behavior of the species in solution. It proved successful in generating species with improved Lewis acidity of the phosphorus center that was then leveraged for small&#8208;molecule activation. Hydride abstraction from an external substrate involving the hypervalent species is followed by an intriguing P&#8208;mediated umpolung from the hydride to a proton and supports the catalytic potential of this class of main&#8208;group Lewis acids for organic chemistry. This study is a comprehensive investigation into various methods, including electronic, chemical, geometric modifications (and sometimes combinations of these approaches) to systematically improve the Lewis acidity of neutral and stable main&#8208;group Lewis acids with practical value for a range of chemical transformations.

         <title>Sidechain&#8208;Backbone Tetrel Bonding Interactions Provide a General Mechanism for trans&#8208;Peptoid Stabilization</title>

A sidechain&#8208;backbone nN&#8594;&#963;*C&#945;&#8722;N tetrel bonding interaction in azapeptoids wherein their sidechain &#945;&#8208;nitrogen lone pair (nN) is delocalized into the &#963;* orbital of the backbone C&#945;&#8722;N bond is shown. Such sidechain&#8208;backbone interactions can provide a general mechanism of trans&#8208;amide stabilization in peptoids having &#945;&#8208;heteroatoms and N&#8208;aryl groups in the sidechain.







Abstract
Cis&#8208;trans isomerization of amide bonds impedes de novo design of folded peptoids (poly&#8208;N&#8208;substituted glycines) with precise secondary structures and affects peptoid&#8208;biomolecule binding affinity. Herein, from X&#8208;ray, NMR and DFT studies of azapeptoids, we have discovered a tetrel bonding interaction that stabilizes trans&#8208;peptoids. We show that peptoids having &#945;&#8208;heteroatoms and N&#8208;aryl groups in the sidechain adopt trans&#8208;amide geometries due to the presence of a nX/&#960;Ar&#8594;&#963;*C&#945;&#8722;N tetrel bonding interaction between the sidechain &#945;&#8208;heteroatom lone pair (nX) or &#960;&#8208;electrons (&#960;Ar) and the &#963;* orbital of the backbone C&#945;&#8722;N bond. Further, CD spectroscopic studies of oligo&#8208;proline host&#8211;guest model peptides showed that azapeptoid residues stabilize polyproline II helical conformation. These data indicate that the sidechain&#8208;backbone tetrel bonding could be leveraged to design peptoids with precise secondary structures for a wide range of biological and material applications.

         <title>Intermetallic Compound TiM (M=Co, Fe) with a Layered Structure Prepared by Deoxidizing Ilmenite&#8208;type Oxides in Molten LiCl&#8208;CaH2 Mixtures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 32, June 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ilmenite&#8208;type oxides MTiO3 (M=Co, Fe) with layered structures perpendicular to the c axis of the trigonal structure were mildly deoxidized by CaH2 in molten LiCl at 600&#8201;&#176;C to obtain intermetallic compounds TiM with layered structures after the deoxidation time of 15&#8211;120&#8197;min. During 1&#8211;5&#8197;min, Li2TiO3&#8208;like compounds were observed as an intermediate to maintain the MTiO3&#8208;originated layered structure.







Abstract
CsCl&#8208;type intermetallic compounds TiM (M=Co, Fe) were obtained by deoxidizing trigonal ilmenite&#8208;type MTiO3 with a reducing agent CaH2 in molten LiCl at 600&#8201;&#176;C. X&#8208;ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy with energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray, and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses revealed the formation of nanoscale layered structures, which enhanced specific surface areas (approximately 20&#8197;m2/g) in the intermetallic compounds. In the initial deoxidation stage, Li2TiO3&#8208;like compounds were observed as an intermediate, suggesting the substitution of M in MTiO3 by Li from the molten LiCl. Compound MTiO3 has a layered structure perpendicular to the c axis of the trigonal structure, suggesting that the layered structures may originate from the crystal structure of the precursors. Formation of the Li2TiO3&#8208;like intermediate may help maintain the original layered structure during deoxidation and the subsequent alloying at temperatures as low as 600&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Esterase Specific Fluorescent Probe: Mechanistic Understanding Using QM/MM Calculation and Cell States Discrimination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 32, June 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An esterase&#8208;specific ratiometric fluorescent probe, PM&#8208;OAc, can distinguish live and dead cells based on esterase enzyme activity. The action of the esterase enzyme and active site for binding with the probe is demonstrated by MD simulation and QM/MM calculations.







Abstract
Esterases enzymes regulate the body's homeostasis by catalyzing the hydrolysis of various esters. These are also involved in protein metabolism, detoxification, and signal transmission. Most importantly, esterase plays a significant role in cell viability and cytotoxicity assays. Hence, developing an efficient chemical probe is essential for monitoring the esterase activity. Several fluorescent probes for esterase have also been reported targeting cytosol and lysosomes. However, the ability to create efficient probes is constrained due to a lack of understanding of the esterase&#8216;s active site for hydrolyzing the substrate. In addition, the fluorescent turn&#8208;on may limit efficient monitoring. Herein, we have developed a unique fluorescent probe, PM&#8208;OAc, to monitor mitochondrial esterase enzyme activity ratiometrically. This probe exhibited a bathochromic wavelength shift with esterase enzyme in alkaline pH (pH&#8764;8.0) due to an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process. The phenomenon is well supported by TD&#8208;DFT calculation. Moreover, the substrate (PM&#8208;OAc) binding at the active site of esterase and its catalytic mechanism to hydrolyze the ester bond are elucidated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and QM/MM (Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics) calculations, respectively. Fluorescent image&#8208;based analysis of the cellular environment reveals that our probe can distinguish between live and dead cells based on esterase enzyme activity.

         <title>Trading Symmetry for Stereoinduction in Tetradentate, non&#8208;C2&#8208;Symmetric Fe(II)&#8208;Complexes for Asymmetric Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 32, June 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of C1&#8208;symmetric bench&#8208;stable stereogenic&#8208;at&#8208;iron complexes comprising a linear, tetradentate ligand scaffold are introduced. The possibility of lowering the overall symmetry is scrutinized for an enantioselective ring&#8208;contraction of isoxazoles to furnish chiral 2H&#8208;azirines under open&#8208;flask conditions with the products serving as useful building blocks to access &#945;&#8208;disubstituted &#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives.







Abstract
A series of stereogenic&#8208;at&#8208;metal iron complexes comprising a non&#8208;C2&#8208;symmetric chiral topology is introduced and applied to asymmetric 3d&#8208;transition metal catalysis. The chiral iron(II) complexes are built from chiral tetradentate N4&#8208;ligands containing a proline&#8208;derived amino pyrrolidinyl backbone which controls the relative (cis&#8208;&#945; coordination) and absolute metal&#8208;centered configuration (&#923; vs. &#916;).

&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetric chiral topology is introduced and applied to asymmetric 3d-transition metal catalysis. The chiral iron(II) complexes are built from chiral tetradentate N4-ligands containing a proline-derived amino pyrrolidinyl backbone which controls the relative (&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-&#945; coordination) and absolute metal-centered configuration (&#923; vs. &#916;).

         <title>Highly Selective and Quantitative Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care Diagnostic Method for Adrenaline</title>

The selectivity of a donor&#8211;acceptor Stenhouse adduct (DASA) formation towards epinephrine and an activated furfural moiety was exploited to generate a single&#8208;molecule colorimetric probe for the neurotransmitter epinephrine. An error&#8208;free detection of epinephrine among nine neurotransmitters was demonstrated. Quantitative prediction of epinephrine with high precision was carried out by using images and its analysis with machine&#8208;learning techniques.







Abstract
Adrenaline, also known as epinephrine, is a neurotransmitter/hormone that is an important target in diagnostics. Development of an effective method for detecting it in the presence of other neurotransmitters is a challenging task. The electrochemical and fluorescent techniques commonly used have low selectivity in distinguishing among catecholamines. Herein, a small&#8208;molecule organic probe with an activated furfural moiety is reported to exploit the nucleophilicity of epinephrine to generate a bright&#8208;colored donor&#8211;acceptor Stenhouse adduct. Among nine common neurotransmitters or their analogues, only epinephrine was found to generate a unique colour change discernible with the naked eye, whereas the other ones remain unaffected. Under various in&#8208;field detection conditions, including solution, droplet, and paper strip&#8208;based detection, the colour change were also noticeable. The low detection limit of 1.37&#8197;nM and a limit of quantitation of 4.37&#8197;nM were achieved with simple UV/Vis methods in addition to the sub&#8208;ppm level sensing under visual conditions with naked eyes. The probe could be used for practical colorimetric measurements as a point&#8208;of&#8208;care tool without any complex and expensive machinery, making this approach accessible to all. In addition, using a simple smartphone, the determination of epinephrine concentrations is possible by using machine&#8208;learning techniques.

         <title>Trumpet&#8208;Like ZnS@C Composite for High&#8208;Performance Potassium Ion Battery Anode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 32, June 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The trumpet&#8208;like ZnS@C composite was synthesized by template method using sodium citrate as carbon source followed by vulcanization process. As potassium ion batteries (PIBs) anode, the trumpet&#8208;like ZnS@C composite exhibits excellent rate property and cyclic performance. The outstanding electrochemical performance of the ZnS@C composite is ascribed to its unique structure, which can mitigate the volume expansion of ZnS in the charge/discharge process, expand the contact area between the electrode and electrolyte, and improve the conductivity of electrode materials by the introduction of carbon layer.







Abstract
ZnS has acquired increasing attention for high&#8208;performance PIBs anode because of its remarkable theoretical capacity, and redox reversibility for conversion reaction. However, the larger volume variation and delayed reaction kinetics for the ZnS in the discharge/charge processes lead to pulverization and severe capacity degradation. Herein, the trumpet&#8208;like ZnS@C composite was synthesized by template method by using sodium citrate as carbon source followed by vulcanization process. As potassium ion batteries (PIB) anode, ZnS@C composite exhibits good rate performance and long life (stable reversible capacity of 107.8&#8197;mAh/g over 2000&#8197;charge&#8208;discharge cycles at 5&#8197;A/g and high reversible capacity of 310&#8197;mAh/g at 0.1&#8197;A/g). The outstanding electrochemical performance of the ZnS@C composite is ascribed to its unique structure, which can mitigate the volume expansion of ZnS in the charge discharge process, expand the contact area between the electrode and electrolyte, and improve the conductivity of electrode materials by the introduction of carbon layer. This method of synthesizing trumpet&#8208;like ZnS@C composite provides an important strategy for obtaining potassium ion batteries anode with long cycle.

Highly branched NiCoP concave nanocrosses with well&#8208;defined six axial arms and high&#8208;density atomic steps, ledges and kinks are highly efficient as electro&#8208;catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Concave nanostructure with highly branched architecture and abundant step atoms is one kind of desirable materials for energy conversion devices. However, current synthetic strategies for non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based NiCoP concave nanostructure still remain challenging. Herein, we demonstrate a site&#8208;selective chemical etching and subsequent phosphorating strategy to fabricate highly branched NiCoP concave nanocrosses (HB&#8208;NiCoP CNCs). The HB&#8208;NiCoP CNCs are consisted of six axial arms in three&#8208;dimensional space and each protruding arm is equipped with high&#8208;density atomic steps, ledges and kinks. As an electrocatalyst towards oxygen evolution reaction, the HB&#8208;NiCoP CNCs exhibit remarkably enhanced activity and stability, with small overpotential of 289&#8197;mV to reach 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, surpassing the NiCoP nanocages and commercial RuO2. The superior OER performance of HB&#8208;NiCoP CNCs is originated from the highly branched concave structure, the synergistic effect between bimetal Ni and Co atoms, as well as the electronic structure modulation from P.

         <title>Inclusion Complex Formation with Tetra&#8208;PEGylated Tetraphenylporphyrin and Face&#8208;to&#8208;Face Cyclodextrin Dimer through Unprecedented Molecular Threading</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 32, June 7, 2023. </description>

A synthetic tetra&#8208;PEGylated tetraphenylporphyrin (FePEG5kTPP) formed an 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 inclusion complex with a face&#8208;to&#8208;face cyclodextrin dimer in aqueous solution. The O2 adduct of the ferrous complex shows similar O2 binding affinity with natural hemoglobin and a long circulation time in blood, leading to the simple supramolecular complex that can be used as an artificial O2 carrier in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Herein, a host&#8211;guest inclusion complex formation between tetra&#8208;PEGylated tetraphenylporphyrin with a per&#8208;O&#8208;methylated cyclodextrin (CD) dimer through the molecular threading process that is physically unexpected to occur is described. Although the molecular size of the PEGylated porphyrin is much greater than that of the CD dimer, the sandwich&#8208;type porphyrin/CD dimer 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 inclusion complex was spontaneously formed in water. The ferrous porphyrin complex binds O2 reversibly in aqueous solution, which functions as an artificial O2 carrier in&#8197;vivo. Pharmacokinetic study using rats revealed that the inclusion complex showed a long circulation in blood in contrast to the complex without PEG. We further demonstrate the unique host&#8211;guest exchange reaction from the PEGylated porphyrin/CD monomer 1/2 inclusion complex to the 1/1 complex with the CD dimer through the complete dissociation process of the CD monomers.

The ferrous porphyrin complex binds O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reversibly in aqueous solution, which functions as an artificial O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; carrier in&#8197;vivo. Pharmacokinetic study using rats revealed that the inclusion complex showed a long circulation in blood in contrast to the complex without PEG. We further demonstrate the unique host&#8211;guest exchange reaction from the PEGylated porphyrin/CD monomer 1/2 inclusion complex to the 1/1 complex with the CD dimer through the complete dissociation process of the CD monomers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Various transformations of the initial cyclo&#8208;P5 ligand in the triple&#8208;decker complex [(Cp*Fe)(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co)(&#956;,&#951;5&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;4&#8208;P5)] show that the reaction with main group nucleophiles yields different products depending on the steric demand of the nucleophile used. Subsequent oxidation/electrophilic quenching provides a plethora of P5R2 and P6R3 organophosphorus ligand complexes in unique 1,3 or 1,4 substitution pattern as opposed to the parent complex [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)].







Abstract
The heterobimetallic triple&#8208;decker complex [(Cp*Fe)(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co)(&#956;,&#951;5&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;4&#8208;P5)] (1) was functionalized by main group nucleophiles and subsequently electrophilically quenched or oxidized. Reacting 1 with group&#8197;14 nucleophiles revealed different organo&#8208;substituted P5R middle&#8208;decks depending on the steric and electronic effects of the used alkali metal organyls (2: R=tBu; 3: R=Me). Further, with group&#8197;15 nucleophiles, the first structural characterized monosubstituted complexes with phosphanides could be obtained as P5 ligands containing exocyclic {PR2} units (4: R=Cy, H; 5: R=Ph). These monoanionic complexes 2&#8211;5 were isolated and subsequent electrophilic quenching revealed novel types of neutral functionalized polyphosphorus complexes. These complexes bear formal chains of P5R'R&#8217;&#8217; (6: R&#8217;=tBu, R&#8217;=Me) in a 1,3&#8208;disubstitution pattern or P6R'R&#8217;&#8217;R&#8217;&#8217;&#8217; units (7: R&#8217;=Cy, R&#8217;&#8217;=H, R&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;=Me; 8: R&#8217;=Me, R&#8217;&#8217;=Ph, R&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;=Me) in a 1,1,3&#8208;substitution as middle&#8208;decks stabilized by one {Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co} and one {Cp*Fe} fragment. One&#8208;electron oxidation of 2, 3 or 5 by AgBF4 gave access to paramagnetic triple&#8208;decker complexes bearing P5R middle&#8208;decks in various coordination fashions (R=tBu (10), R=PPh2 (12)). Interestingly, for R=Me (11), a dimerization is observed revealing a diamagnetic tetranuclear cluster containing a unique dihydrofulvalene&#8208;type P10R2 ligand. All complexes were characterized by crystallographic and spectroscopic methods (EPR, multinuclear NMR and mass spectrometry) and their electronic structures were elucidated by DFT calculations.

         <title>Highly Efficient Wavelength&#8208;Tunable Circularly Polarized Luminescence Film Constructed by Responsive Chiral Aggregation&#8208;induced Emission Luminophore</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 32, June 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The free&#8208;standing film constructed by responsive chiral AIE luminophore not only showed highly efficient CPL (glum&#8764;+0.75), but also exhibited a wavelength&#8208;tunable CPL from blue to yellow (503&#8197;nm to 548&#8197;nm).







Abstract
Key Lab of Environment&#8208;friendly Chemistry and Circularly polarized luminescent (CPL) materials with multitudinous inherent advantages shows extensive application. In this work, we prepare a kind of highly efficient wavelength&#8208;tunable CPL free&#8208;standing films by responsive chiral aggregation&#8208;induced emission mesogen. Firstly, the pyridine&#8208;functionalized tetraphenylethene monomer (MPy) is designed and synthesized. Then, the different ration of the monomer MPy mixed with the liquid crystal (LC) reactive monomer (LC242) to fabricate a free&#8208;standing film by photopolymerization. The obtained film presents efficient CPL with a constant luminescence asymmetry factor (glum) of +0.75, as well as sensitive wavelength tunability. Finally, this wavelength&#8208;tunable CPL film with both fluorescence and CPL modes is successfully applied in anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption. This work provides a simple way to construct CPL apparatus with adjustable luminescence wavelength and high glum.

         <title>Quantitative Electromerism of a Well&#8208;defined Mononuclear Copper Complex Through Reversible Intramolecular Metal&#8208;Ligand Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 32, June 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electromerism in coordination chemistry allows to control the electron distribution and thereby the physical properties and reactivity. Here the first example for quantitative temperature&#8208;dependent electromerism of a mononuclear copper complex is reported, and the factors responsible for this behaviour are analysed.







Abstract
Copper amine oxidases are enzymes that exhibit in their active site a mononuclear copper complex and a 2,4,5&#8208;trihydroxyphenylalanine quinone (TPQ) cofactor; in the oxidative half of the catalytic cycle, the enzymes regulate their activity by a temperature&#8208;dependent electron transfer equilibrium between the CuII complex with the reduced, aminoquinol form of the cofactor and the reactive CuI complex with the corresponding oxidized, semiquinone form of the cofactor. Here, we report the first mononuclear copper complex with redox&#8208;active ligands showing quantitative, reversible electromerism between a CuII eletromer with reduced, neutral ligand and a CuI electromer with an oxidized, radical monocationic ligand. The CuII form, being exclusively present at low temperature, exhibits a lower enthalpy (like the enzymes), but the CuI complex exhibits a higher entropy and is exclusively present at room temperature in CH2Cl2 solution. Further analysis, based on six different copper complexes, discloses a large solvent effect on electromerism.

         <title>Pd&#8722;Bi Bimetallic Nanochains for Electroreduction of CO2 to Syngas in Ionic Liquid&#8208;Based Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 32, June 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
PdxBi bimetallic nanochains can electrochemically reduce CO2 to syngas with adjustable CO/H2 ratios from 1/7 to 9/1. The outstanding electrocatalytic performance of Pd3Bi bimetallic nanochains could be ascribed to the incorporation of moderate Bi into Pd lattice, which brought about strong adsorption capacity of CO2, abundant active sites, and fast electron transfer rate.







Abstract
The electroreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) is a sustainable method for generating valuable chemicals; however, avoiding unwanted hydrogen (H2) production during the electrolysis is a major challenge. Coproduction of carbon monoxide (CO) and H2 to produce syngas is an effective strategy for solving this problem, and syngas with a desired CO/H2 ratio can be employed to produce methanol or other valuable chemicals. Herein, a series of palladium&#8208;bismuth (Pd&#8722;Bi) bimetallic nanochains with different Pd/Bi atomic ratios were prepared and used in the electroreduction of CO2 to syngas in ionic liquid&#8208;based electrolytes. The ratio of CO/H2 in syngas was regulated in a wide range from 1&#8201;:&#8201;7 to 9&#8201;:&#8201;1 by controlling the applied potentials, Pd/Bi atomic ratios and composition of the electrolytes. In particular, the current density reached 19.3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 on Pd3Bi bimetallic nanochains at an applied potential of &#8722;2.3&#8197;V versus Ag/Ag+ when the CO/H2 ratio was approximately 1&#8201;:&#8201;1. Moreover, the maximum CO Faradaic efficiency was 87.7&#8201;% for these electrocatalysts at an applied potential of &#8722;2.0&#8197;V versus Ag/Ag+. The synergistic effect of Pd and Bi in the ionic liquid&#8208;based electrolyte was the primary reason for the distinct electrocatalytic efficiency of the Pd3Bi bimetallic nanochains. The incorporation of moderate amounts of Bi into the Pd lattice resulted in a stronger CO2 adsorption capacity, more active sites and faster electron transfer rate, which are conducive to improving the electrocatalytic activity.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pd&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Bi bimetallic nanochains&lt;/b&gt; can electrochemically reduce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to syngas with adjustable CO/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ratios from 1/7 to 9/1. The outstanding electrocatalytic performance of Pd&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi bimetallic nanochains could be ascribed to the incorporation of moderate Bi into Pd lattice, which brought about strong adsorption capacity of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, abundant active sites, and fast electron transfer rate.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electroreduction of carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is a sustainable method for generating valuable chemicals; however, avoiding unwanted hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) production during the electrolysis is a major challenge. Coproduction of carbon monoxide (CO) and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to produce syngas is an effective strategy for solving this problem, and syngas with a desired CO/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ratio can be employed to produce methanol or other valuable chemicals. Herein, a series of palladium-bismuth (Pd&#8722;Bi) bimetallic nanochains with different Pd/Bi atomic ratios were prepared and used in the electroreduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to syngas in ionic liquid-based electrolytes. The ratio of CO/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in syngas was regulated in a wide range from 1&#8201;:&#8201;7 to 9&#8201;:&#8201;1 by controlling the applied potentials, Pd/Bi atomic ratios and composition of the electrolytes.

         <title>Dynamic Approach to Synthetic Lectin for Glucose with Boosted Binding Affinity through C&#8722;H Hydrogen Bonds</title>

         <dc:description>
Biomimetic receptor for glucose has been developed by using dynamic imine chemistry followed by imine&#8208;to&#8208;amide oxidation. The design of the receptor features two parallel durene panels forming a hydrophobic pocket. The incorporation of two pyridinium residues enhances water solubility and improves substrate binding by establishing more hydrogen bonds.







Abstract
A biomimetic receptor for glucose has been developed with high affinity and selectivity. The receptor was efficiently synthesized in three steps through dynamic imine chemistry followed by imine&#8208;to&#8208;amide oxidation. The receptor features two parallel durene panels, forming a hydrophobic pocket for [CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;] interactions, and two pyridinium residues directing four amide bonds towards the pocket. These pyridinium residues not only improve solubility but also provide polarized C&#8722;H bonds for hydrogen bonding. Experimental data and DFT calculations show that these polarized C&#8722;H bonds significantly enhance substrate binding. These findings demonstrate the power of dynamic covalent chemistry for creating molecular receptors and using polarized C&#8722;H bonds for boosted carbohydrate recognition in water, providing a foundation for developing glucose&#8208;responsive materials and sensors.

Putting the contortion back into the truxene fragments. Substitution of the methylene fragments by strongly electron accepting phosphaalkene or arsaalkenes provides new tuning opportunities for twisted PAHs.







Abstract
We report the functionalization and deplanarization of truxenes using pnictaalkene fragments. Selective introduction of one, two, or three Mes*&#8208;Pn fragments provides up to three fully reversible reductions based on the Pn=C fragments. The incorporation of the unsaturated heteroelement fragment as well as the contortion of the truxene core result in significantly red&#8208;shifted absorption spectra and interesting opto&#8208;electronic properties which are studied by electrochemistry and spectro&#8208;electrochemistry. Incorporation of arsaalkene (As=C) motifs gives significantly milder reduction potentials and red&#8208;shifted absorption, while phosphaalkene decorated truxene P3 can be functionalized using Au(I)Cl coordination. Furthermore, solubility is markedly increased upon incorporation of the Pn&#8208;Mes* fragments which renders these materials suitable for solution processing.

         <title>Chalcogen Bonding (ChB) as a Robust Supramolecular Recognition Motif of Benzisothiazolinone Antibacterials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 32, June 7, 2023. </description>

BenzIsothiazolinones are commonly used antibacterial and antifungal agents. In these heterocycles, the propensity of sulfur to form N&#8722;S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O chalcogen bonds is robust enough to allow for the interaction to act as a general and reliable recognition motif in chemical environments suggesting that this may be the case also in biological environment.







Abstract
1,2&#8208;benzisothiazol&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;one derivatives are highly active against a broad spectrum of fungi as well as Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. For this reason they are extensively used, for example, as additives in detergents, leather products, paper coatings, and antifouling paintings. In this paper experimental findings are reported proving that the sulfur atom of benzisothiazolinones have a remarkable tendency to form short and directional chalcogen bondings on the extension of the covalent N&#8722;S bond and, to a lesser extent, of the C&#8722;S bond. Analyses of the Cambridge Structural Database confirm the interaction as a primary recognition motif of these systems. The electrophilicity of sulfur is crucial in the chemical reactions initiating the cascade of events resulting in the biopharmacological activities of benzisothiazolinones. The reported results suggest that the electrophility of sulfur may play a role also at earlier stages than the reactive ones, namely it may pin the compounds at the active site of target enzymes via chalcogen bondings that preorganize the system in the conformation required for the bonds formation/cleavage determining the biopharmacological activity

Ligands derived from bicyclo[2.2.2]oct&#8208;7&#8208;ene&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetracarboxydiimide units are found to provide a suitably rigid backbone for the synthesis of porous metal&#8208;organic cages. Crystallographic studies show that the cages display a degree of flexibility in the solid state, while the activation protocols followed are a determining factor in the gas uptake capacity of the cages.







Abstract
Three new ligands containing a bicyclo[2.2.2]oct&#8208;7&#8208;ene&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetracarboxydiimide unit have been used to assemble lantern&#8208;type metal&#8208;organic cages with the general formula [Cu4L4]. Functionalisation of the backbone of the ligands leads to distinct crystal packing motifs between the three cages, as observed with single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The three cages vary in their gas sorption behaviour, and the capacity of the materials for CO2 is found to depend on the activation conditions: softer activation conditions lead to superior uptake, and one of the cages displays the highest BET surface area found for lantern&#8208;type cages so far.

         <title>Functional Characterisation of Highly Conserved and Structurally Prominent Residues of 2&#8208;Methylisoborneol Synthase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 32, June 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new 2&#8208;methylisoborneol synthases phylogenetically unrelated to the known enzyme from Streptomyces coelicolor (ScMIBS) were functionally characterised. ScMIBS was extensively investigated by site&#8208;directed mutagenesis in 31 positions that were selected based on the enzyme structure and their high conservation, revealing several structural motifs that are important for catalysis.







Abstract
2&#8208;Methylisoborneol is a widespread musty odourant that is produced by many bacteria including actinomycetes, cyanobacteria and myxobacteria. Two 2&#8208;methylisoborneol synthases (MIBS) that are phylogenetically distant to the known enzyme from Streptomyces coelicolor were found to be highly active for 2&#8208;methylisoborneol biosynthesis. Based on the enzyme structure and on an amino acid sequence alignment, the MIBS from S. coelicolor was extensively studied through site&#8208;directed mutagenesis.

         <title>Traceless N&#8208;Polyfluoroalkylation of Weakly Nucleophilic Nitrogen Containing Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 32, June 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;polyfluoroalkylation reactions are challenging due to the high cost, toxicity or environmental impact of commonly used polyfluoroalkylation reagents. We report the sulfuryl fluoride (SO2F2)&#8208;mediated N&#8208;polyfluoroalkylation of weakly nucleophilic nitrogen compounds from readily available fluorinated alcohols. This method opens access to a variety of N&#8208;polyfluoroalkylated building blocks that are highly valuable for life science applications.







Abstract
Here we report an efficient access to high&#8208;value N&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl anilines, primary polyfluoroalkylamines and N,N&#8208;bis(polyfluoroalkyl)amines, via N&#8208;polyfluoroalkylation of sulfonamides and phthalimide derivatives using sulfuryl fluoride (SO2F2). The in&#8197;situ formation of polyfluoroalkyl fluorosulfonates from commercially available fluorinated alcohols and economical sulfuryl fluoride is highly advantageous given that some polyfluoroalkyl halides are ozone&#8208;depleting substances (ODS) regulated by the Montreal protocol. This general method is applied to the polyfluoroalkylation of a variety of sulfonamides, N&#8208;sulfonyl carbamates and phthalimide with a wide tolerance of functional groups. The process thus provides viable access for industry to N&#8208;(polyfluoroalkyl)anilines as well as primary and secondary N&#8208;(polyfluoroalkyl)amines, which are very valuable but not easily accessible building blocks for life science applications.

         <title>Site&#8208;selective Hydrogenation/Deuteration of Benzylic Olefins Enabled by Electroreduction Using Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 32, June 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electroreduction of benzylic olefins has been applied to site&#8208;selectively hydrogenate such double bonds while other functions that react under regular hydrogenation conditions are present. By the use of water as proton source this protocol also allows deuteration by simply switching to D2O. The applicability of this method was shown by the use of a commercially available electrolysis setup and a broad substrate scope.







Abstract
We describe an operationally simple and user&#8208;friendly protocol that allows the site&#8208;selective hydrogenation and deuteration of di&#8208;, tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted benzylic olefins by electroreduction while other groups prone to hydrogenation are present. The radical anionic intermediates react with the most inexpensive hydrogen/deuterium source H2O/D2O. Our method overcomes many limitations that arise from previously reported electroreductive hydrogenations. The applicability of this reaction is demonstrated by a broad substrate scope (&gt;50 examples) that focuses on functional group tolerance and sites that are affected by metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation (alkenes, alkynes, protecting groups).

         <title>Flow Electrochemistry for the N&#8208;Nitrosation of Secondary Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 32, June 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Go with the flow: N&#8208;Nitroso compounds have been synthesised from secondary amines by using sodium nitrite in an electrochemical flow setup. A 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixture of acetonitrile and water was used for this reaction, making this a mild approach avoiding the use of additional supporting electrolytes. N&#8208;Nitrosamines could be obtained in yields up to 99&#8201;%, and several compounds could be purified with an in&#8208;line acidic extraction.







Abstract
A flow electrochemical method towards the synthesis of N&#8208;nitroso compounds from secondary amines using cheap and readily available sodium nitrite has been developed. Sodium nitrite dissolved in aqueous acetonitrile made additional electrolytes unnecessary. This mild and straightforward approach made the use of acids or other harsh and toxic chemicals redundant. This procedure was applied to an assortment of cyclic and acyclic secondary amines (27 examples) resulting in yields of N&#8208;nitrosamines as high as 99&#8201;%. To demonstrate the practicality of the process, scaled&#8208;up reactions were performed. Finally, selected products could be purified by using an in&#8208;line acidic extraction.

Molecules putting on sleeveless shirts: Porphyrins with four sufficiently long PEG chains can form 1:1 supramolecular inclusion complexes with a 3,3&#8217;&#8208;linked cyclodextrin dimer in water through a molecular threading process. This phenomenon is similar to the action of putting on a sleeveless shirt, don't you think? More information can be found in the Research Article by Q. Mao and H.

         <title>Cover Feature: Flow Electrochemistry for the N&#8208;Nitrosation of Secondary Amines (Chem. Eur. J. 32/2023)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 32, June 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemistry is a valuable tool used by modern synthetic chemists who use electricity to facilitate redox reactions. In this image, created by Karrar Nadhom, the dragon provides the electrical surge to create a reaction between sodium nitrite and a secondary amine, which are fused to form the N&#8208;nitroso product. Despite dragons being extinct in most parts of the world, the title reaction is an ecologically green process, as indicated by the colour of the dragon. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Wirth and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300957).

         <title>Front Cover: Negative Homotropic Cooperativity in Guest Binding of a Trisporphyrin Double Cleft (Chem. Eur. J. 32/2023)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 32, June 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triple&#8208;layered trisporphyrin molecule possessing two cleft cavities showed negative homotropic cooperativity in the host&#8211;guest complex. When an electron&#8208;deficient guest molecule (yellow) was accommodated within one of the cleft cavities, the electronic structure of the porphyrin was altered, and the binding power of the remaining cavity was reduced. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Haino and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300107).

         <title>Spin in Organic Cocrystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 32, June 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this Review, we highlight the recent advancement of the spin effect in organic cocrystals. Besides the magnetic and multiferroic properties in binary/ternary cocrystals and radical cocrystals, other spin phenomena (spin multiplicity, mechanoresponsive spin, chiral orbit and spin&#8208;crossover) and the mobility on spin transport are discussed. The better comprehension of current achievements and challenges could offer guidance for the further development of organic spintronics.







Abstract
Organic spintronics has caused a huge revolution in creating highly efficient low&#8208;power circuits. Spin manipulation in organic cocrystals has become a promising strategy to uncover more chemicophysical properties for diverse applications. In this Minireview, we summarize the recent advancements of spin properties in organic charge&#8208;transfer cocrystals, and briefly describe the possible mechanisms behind them. Beside the known spin properties (spin multiplicity, mechanoresponsive spin, chiral orbit and spin&#8208;crossover) in binary/ternary cocrystals, other spin phenomena in radical cocrystals and spin transport are also summarized and discussed. Hopefully, deep understanding of current achievements, challenges and perspectives will offer the clear direction for the introduction of spin in organic cocrystals.

         <title>Steric Control over the Threading of Pyrophosphonates with One or Two Cyanostar Macrocycles during Pseudorotaxane Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Control over the binding stoichiometry and the threading kinetics is achieved in pseudorotaxanes comprising the anion&#8208;binding cyanostar macrocycle and organic pyrophosphonates with fine&#8208;tuned steric bulk. The approach allowed the selective assembly of [3]pseudorotaxanes and [2]pseudorotaxanes, and it provided insights that are valuable for future work on anion recognition and the design of molecular machines.







Abstract
The supramolecular recognition of anions is increasingly harnessed to achieve the self&#8208;assembly of supramolecular architectures, ranging from cages and polymers to (pseudo)rotaxanes. The cyanostar (CS) macrocycle has previously been shown to form 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 complexes with organophosphate anions that can be turned into [3]rotaxanes by stoppering. Here we achieved steric control over the assembly of pseudorotaxanes comprising the cyanostar macrocycle and a thread that is based, for the first time, on organo&#8208;pyrophosphonates. Subtle differences in steric bulk on the threads allowed formation of either [3]pseudorotaxanes or [2]pseudorotaxanes. We demonstrate that the threading kinetics are governed by the steric demand of the organo&#8208;pyrophosphonates and in one case, slows down to the timescale of minutes. Calculations show that the dianions are sterically offset inside the macrocycles. Our findings broaden the scope of cyanostar&#8208;anion assemblies and may have relevance for the design of molecular machines whose directionality is a result of relatively slow slipping.

         <title>Radical&#8208;Based Convergent Paired Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical&#8208;based convergent paired electrolysis, which is driven by inexpensive electricity, is a green and unique approach to otherwise challenging redox&#8208;neutral reactions. The difficulty associated with the technique is imposed by the fleeting nature of radicals and the gap between electrodes. This concept article introduces recent state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advances in this field and discusses how to overcome the obstacles.







Abstract
Electrochemistry offers a sustainable platform for discovering reactions involving single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) that generates highly reactive and synthetically versatile radical species. Compared with photochemistry similarly specializing in SET which requires expensive photocatalysts, electrochemistry employs low&#8208;cost electricity to drive the electron flow. Paired electrolysis makes use of both half&#8208;reactions, thus obviating the need for sacrificial reactions and maximizing the atom and energy economy. In convergent paired electrolysis, anodic oxidation and cathodic reduction occur simultaneously to generate two intermediates, which are then coupled to furnish the product. It represents a distinctive approach to challenging redox&#8208;neutral reactions. However, the gap between the two electrodes makes it hard for a reactive intermediate to come across the other coupling partner. This concept article summarizes recent state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advances on radical&#8208;based convergent paired electrolysis, which adopted different strategies to overcome the difficulty.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Radical-based convergent paired electrolysis&lt;/b&gt;, which is driven by inexpensive electricity, is a green and unique approach to otherwise challenging redox-neutral reactions. The difficulty associated with the technique is imposed by the fleeting nature of radicals and the gap between electrodes. This concept article introduces recent state-of-the-art advances in this field and discusses how to overcome the obstacles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochemistry offers a sustainable platform for discovering reactions involving single-electron transfer (SET) that generates highly reactive and synthetically versatile radical species. Compared with photochemistry similarly specializing in SET which requires expensive photocatalysts, electrochemistry employs low-cost electricity to drive the electron flow. Paired electrolysis makes use of both half-reactions, thus obviating the need for sacrificial reactions and maximizing the atom and energy economy. In convergent paired electrolysis, anodic oxidation and cathodic reduction occur simultaneously to generate two intermediates, which are then coupled to furnish the product. It represents a distinctive approach to challenging redox-neutral reactions. However, the gap between the two electrodes makes it hard for a reactive intermediate to come across the other coupling partner. This concept article summarizes recent state-of-the-art advances on radical-based convergent paired electrolysis, which adopted different strategies to overcome the difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rapid Chemical Synthesis of Serine Protease Inhibitor Kazal&#8208;type 13 (SPINK13) Glycoform by a Combined Method with Glycan Insertion Strategy and Fast&#8208;Flow Fmoc SPPS

Glycosylated asparagine thioacid was designed to chemoselectively be inserted between two peptide segments at the sterically bulky amino acids sequence Pro&#8208;Asn(N&#8208;glycan)&#8208;Val junction by two coupling reactions which consist of diacyl disulfide coupling (DDC) and thioacid capture ligation (TCL). The both N and C terminus peptides were prepared by a fast&#8208;flow Fmoc SPPS method. A combined method with DDC, TCL and a fast&#8208;flow Fmoc SPPS method successfully shortened the route of glycoprotein synthesis.







Abstract
Serine protease inhibitor Kazal type 13 (SPINK13) is a secreted protein that has been recently studied as a therapeutic drug and an interesting biomarker for cancer cells. Although SPINK13 has a consensus sequence (Pro&#8208;Asn&#8208;Val&#8208;Thr) for N&#8208;glycosylation, the existence of N&#8208;glycosylation and its functions are still unclear. In addition to this, the preparation of glycosylated SPINK 13 has not been examined by both the cell expression method and chemical synthesis. Herein we report the chemical synthesis of the scarce N&#8208;glycosylated form of SPINK13 by a rapid synthetic method combined with the chemical glycan insertion strategy and a fast&#8208;flow SPPS method. Glycosylated asparagine thioacid was designed to chemoselectively be inserted between two peptide segments where is the sterically bulky Pro&#8208;Asn(N&#8208;glycan)&#8208;Val junction by two coupling reactions which consist of diacyl disulfide coupling (DDC) and thioacid capture ligation (TCL). This insertion strategy successfully afforded the full&#8208;length polypeptide of SPINK13 within two steps from glycosylated asparagine thioacid. Because the two peptides used for this synthesis were prepared by a fast&#8208;flow SPPS, the total synthetic time of glycoprotein was considerably shortened. This synthetic concept enables us to repetitively synthesize a target glycoprotein easily. Folding experiments afforded well&#8208;folded structure confirmed by CD and disulfide bond map. Invasion assays of glycosylated SPINK13 and non&#8208;glycosylated SPINK13 with pancreatic cancer cells showed that non&#8208;glycosylated SPINK&#8208;13 was more potent than that of glycosylated SPINK13.

         <title>Synthesis of neuraminidase&#8208;resistant sialyllactose mimetics from Nacyl mannosamines using metabolically engineered Escherichia coli</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe the efficient gram&#8208;scale synthesis of &#945;2,3&#8208; and &#945;2,6&#8208;sialyllactose oligosaccharides as well as mimetics from N&#8208;acyl mannosamines and lactose in metabolically engineered bacterial cells grown at high cell density. We designed new E. coli strains coexpressing sialic acid synthase and N&#8208;acylneuraminate cytidylyltransferase from Campylobacter jejuni together with the &#945;2,3&#8208;sialyltransferase from Neisseria meningitidis or the &#945;2,6sialyltransferase from Photobacterium sp. JT&#8208;ISH&#8208;224. Using their mannose transporter, these new strains actively internalized N&#8208;acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) and its N&#8208;propanoyl (N&#8208;Prop), N&#8208;butanoyl (N&#8208;But) and N&#8208;phenylacetyl (N&#8208;PhAc) analogs and converted them into the corresponding sialylated oligosaccharides, with overall yields between 10% and 39% (200&#8208;700 mg.L&#8208;1 of culture). The three &#945;2,6&#8208;sialyllactose analogs showed similar binding affinity for Sambucus nigra SNA&#8208;I lectin as for the natural oligosaccharide. They also proved to be stable competitive inhibitors of Vibrio cholerae neuraminidase. These N&#8208;acyl sialosides therefore hold promise for the development of anti&#8208;adhesion therapy against influenza viral infections.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Crystal Structures, and Ion Pairing of &#954;6N Complexes with Rare Earth Elements in the Solid State and in Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rare earth element complexes (Ln = Y, La, Sm, Lu, Ce) of several podant &#954;6N&#8208;coordinating ligands have been synthetized and thoroughly characterized. The structural properties of the complexes have been investigated by X&#8208;ray diffraction in the solid state and by advanced NMR methods in solution. To estimate the donor capabilities of the presented ligands, an experimental comparison study has been conducted by cyclic voltammetry as well as absorption experiments using the cerium complexes and by analyzing 89Y NMR chemical shifts of the different yttrium complexes. In order to obtain a complete and detailed picture, all experiments were corroborated by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantum chemical calculations. Finally, coordination competition studies have been carried out by means of 1H and 31P NMR spectroscopy to investigate the correlation with donor properties and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Electrophilic Mononuclear Cationic Aluminum Alkoxide Complexes: Syntheses, Reactivity and Catalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report on the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;diketiminate supported aluminum complexes bearing terminal alkoxide and mono&#8208;thiol functional groups: LAlOMe(Et) (2), LAlOtBu(Et) (3), and LAlSH(Et) (4), (L= [HC{C(Me)N&#8208;(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3)}2]). Complexes 2 and 3 are further utilized as synthons to generate some fascinating cationic aluminum alkoxide complexes, [LAlOMe(&#181;&#8208;OMe)&#8208;Al(Et)L][EtB(C6F5)3] (5), [LAlOMe(OEt2)][EtB(C6F5)3] (6), and [LAlOtBu(OEt2)][EtB(C6F5)3] (8). These electrophilic cationic species are well characterized by spectroscopic and crystallographic techniques. The assessment of Lewis acidity by the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method revealed superior Lewis acidity of the cations substituted with electron demanding alkoxy groups in comparison to the known methyl analogue [LAlMe][B(C6F5)4]. This has been further endorsed by computational calculations to determine the NBO charges and hydride ion affinity for complexes 6 and 8. These complexes are also capable of activating triethylsilane in stoichiometric reactions. The applicability of these complexes has been realized in the hydrosilylation of ethers, carbonyls, and olefines. Additionally, the solid state structure of a new THF stabilized aluminum halide cation [LAlCl(THF)][B(C6F5)4] (11) has also been reported.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A fluorescent isocoumarin&#8208;fused cycloalkyne
IC9O&#8208;COOMe that is reactive in SPAAC and gives fluorescent triazoles regardless of an azide nature was developed. The study of the S1 state deactivation mechanism of the non&#8208;fluorescent isocumarin&#8208;fused cycloalkyne IC9O using multi&#8208;configurational ab initio and DFT methodologies showed that deactivation proceeds through the electrocyclic ring opening of &#945;&#8208;pyrone and is accompanied by a redistribution of electron density in the fused benzene ring. We proposed that the S1 excited state deactivation barrier can be increased by introducing an acceptor group into a position with a decreasing electron density. As a proof of concept, we designed and synthesized isocumarin&#8208;fused cycloalkyne IC9O&#8208;COOMe bearing electron withdrawing group (COOMe) at the C6 position, which actually turned out to be fluorescent and underwent SPAAC to form fluorescent triazole derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Five Novel Silver&#8208;Based Coordination Polymers as Photoluminescent Sensing Platforms for the Detection of Nitrobenzene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrobenzene (NB) is a highly toxic chemical and a cause for concern to human health and the environment. Hence, it is worthwhile to design new efficient and robust sensing platform for NB. In this study, we present three newly synthesized luminescent silver cluster&#8208;based coordination polymers, {[Ag10(StBu)6(CF3COO)4(hpbt)] (DMAc)2(CH3CN)2}n (hpbt = N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;N&#8221;,N&#8221;&#8208;hexa(pyridine&#8208;4&#8208;yl)benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triamine), [Ag12(StBu)6(CF3COO)6(bpva)3]n (bpva = 9,10&#8208;Bis(2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)vinyl)anthracene), and {[Ag12(StBu)6(CF3COO)6(bpb)(DMAc)2(H2O)2] (DMAc)2}n (bpb = 1,4&#8208;Bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)benzene) composed of Ag10, Ag12 and Ag12 cluster cores, respectively, connected by multidentate pyridine linkers. Besides, two new luminescent polymorphic silver(I)&#8208;based coordination polymers, [Ag(CF3COO)(dpa)]n (dpa = 9,10&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl)anthracene) referred to as Agdpa (H) and Agdpa (R), where H and R denote the hexagon&#8208;like and rod&#8208;like crystal shapes, respectively, have been prepared. The coordination polymers exhibit highly sensitive luminescence quenching effect to NB, attributed to the &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking interactions between the polymers and NB as well as the electron&#8208;withdrawing character of NB.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Soluble Cyclic Organoalanes Based on Anionic Dicarbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclic organoalane compounds [(ADCAr)AlH2]2 (ADCAr = ArC{(DippN)C}2; Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3; Ar = Ph or 4&#8208;PhC6H4 (Bp)) based on anionic dicarbene (ADC) frameworks have been reported as crystalline solids. Treatments of Li(ADCAr) with LiAlH4 at room temperature afford [(ADCAr)AlH2]2 with the concomitant release of LiH. Compounds [(ADCAr)AlH2]2 are stable crystalline solids and are freely soluble in common organic solvents. They are annulated tricyclic compounds with an almost planar central C4Al2&#8208;core embedded between two peripheral 1,3&#8208;imidazole (C3N2) rings. At room temperature, [(ADCPh)AlH2]2 readily reacts with CO2 to form two&#8208; and four&#8208;fold hydroalumination products [(ADCPh)AlH(OCHO)]2 and [(ADCPh)Al(OCHO)2]2, respectively. Further hydroalumination reactivity of [(ADCAr)AlH2]2 has been shown with isocyanate (RNCO) and isothiocyanate (RNCS) species (R = alkyl or aryl group). All compounds have been characterized by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrasmall Gold Nanoparticles as Clients of Biomolecular Condensates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) of biopolymers to form condensates is a widespread phenomenon in living cells. Agents that target or alter condensation can help uncover elusive physiological and pathological mechanisms. Owing to their unique material properties and modes of interaction with biomolecules, nanoparticles represent attractive condensate&#8208;targeting agents.
Our work focused on elucidating the interaction between ultrasmall gold nanoparticles (usGNPs) and diverse types of condensates of tau, a representative phase&#8208;separating protein associated with neurodegenerative disorders. usGNPs attract considerable interest in the biomedical community due to unique features, including emergent optical properties and good cell penetration. We explored the interaction of usGNPs with reconstituted self&#8208;condensates of tau, two&#8208;component tau/polyanion and three&#8208;component tau/RNA/alpha&#8208;synuclein coacervates.
The usGNPs were found to concentrate into condensed liquid droplets, consistent with the formation of dynamic client (nanoparticle) &#8211; scaffold (tau) interactions, and were observable thanks to their intrinsic luminescence. Furthermore, usGNPs were capable to promote LLPS of a protein domain which is unable to phase separate on its own.
Our study demonstrates the ability of usGNPs to interact with and illuminate protein condensates. We anticipate that nanoparticles will have broad applicability as nanotracers to interrogate phase separation, and as nanoactuators controlling the formation and dissolution of condensates.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Alkoxylation, Dehydrogenative&#8208;Polymerization and Tandem Hydrosilylative&#8208;Alkoxylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkoxylation, hydrosilylative&#8208;alkoxylation, and dehydrogenative&#8208;polymerization are some of the most widely used transformations in synthetic chemistry. However, these transformations are traditionally catalyzed by precious, and rare late&#8208;transition metals. Presented here is a molecularly defined iron complex that catalyzes alkoxylation, tandem hydrosilylative&#8208;alkoxylation, and dehydrogenative polymerization of silanes under mild conditions. The iron complex [Fe(CO)4(H)(SiPh3)] 1 catalyzes a direct Si&#8208;O coupling reaction between an array of silanes and alcohols to produce desired alkoxysilanes in excellent yield, with H2 as the only byproduct. The iron catalyst tolerates various functional groups and provides access to 20 alkoxysilanes, including essential molecules such as &#946;&#8208;citronellol and cholesterol. Further, complex 1 catalyzes the polymerization of renewable diol and silane monomer to produce a renewable and degradable poly(isosorbide&#8208;silyl ether). Remarkably, complex 1 catalyzes a tandem hydrosilylative&#8208;alkoxylation of alkynes under mild conditions to yield unsaturated silyl ethers. The synthetic utility has been demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale alkoxylation and hydrosilylative&#8208;alkoxylation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Acidic CO2 electrolysis addressing the "alkalinity issue" and achieving high CO2 utilization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) provides a promising approach for sustainable chemical fuel production of carbon neutrality. Neutral and alkaline electrolytes are predominantly employed in the current electrolysis system, but with striking drawbacks of (bi)carbonate (CO32&#8722;/HCO3&#8722;) formation and crossover due to the rapid and thermodynamically favorable reaction between hydroxide (OH&#8722;) with CO2, resulting in low carbon utilization efficiency and short&#8208;lived catalysis. Very recently, CO2RR in acidic media can effectively address the (bi)carbonate issue; however, the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is more kinetically favorable in acidic electrolytes, which dramatically reduces CO2 conversion efficiency. Thus, it is a big challenge to effectively suppress HER and accelerate acidic CO2RR. In this review, we begin by summarizing the recent progress of acidic CO2 electrolysis, discussing the key factors limiting the application of acidic electrolytes. We then systematically discuss addressing strategies for acidic CO2 electrolysis, including electrolyte microenvironment modulation, alkali cations adjusting, surface/interface functionalization, nanoconfinement structural design, and novel electrolyzer exploitation. Finally, the new challenges and perspectives of acidic CO2 electrolysis are suggested. We believe this timely review can arouse researchers' attention to CO2 crossover, inspire new insights to solve the "alkalinity problem" and enable CO2RR as a more sustainable technology.</dc:description>

We believe this timely review can arouse researchers' attention to CO2 crossover, inspire new insights to solve the "alkalinity problem" and enable CO2RR as a more sustainable technology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Pyramidal Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks&#8208;Derived FeP@CoP Aluminium&#8208;Ion Battery Cathode Displaying Low&#8208;Temperature Tolerance and Fast Electron Transfer Kinetics</title>

         <dc:description>
FeP@CoP nanorods derived from pyramidal metal organic frameworks were developed as aluminum&#8208;ion battery cathode, which displays excellent electrochemical performance and fast electron transfer kinetics.







Abstract
Anhui Provincial Engineering Laboratory for Engineering appropriate cathode materials is significant for the development of high&#8208;performance aluminum&#8208;ion (Al&#8208;ion) batteries. Here, a pyramidal metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs)&#8208;derived FeP@CoP composite was developed as cathode, which exhibits good stability and high capacity. FeP@CoP cathode maintains a high capacity of 168&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles, and displays a stable rate&#8208;performance at both room and low temperatures of &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C. After three rounds of rate&#8208;performance cycling, the FeP@CoP composite recovers 178.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.3&#8197;A g&#8722;1. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) calculations verify improved electron&#8208;transfer kinetics with narrowed band gap and enhanced density of states. These findings inspire a broad set of studies on MOFs&#8208;derived composites for high&#8208;performance secondary batteries.

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure and High&#8208;Temperature Dion&#8211;Jacobson Layered Perovskite Polymorphs of KWO3F</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural relationship between the known normal&#8208;pressure modification of KWO3F and its two new siblings synthesized under high pressure and at high temperature is explored. The three polymorphs exhibit varying degrees of symmetry, but all of them belong to an overarching Dion&#8211;Jacobson layered perovskite structure type. In addition to a thorough examination of the phase transitions of KWO3F specifically, this work provides a closer look at the role of anion site occupation in phase transitions of mixed&#8208;anion compounds.







Abstract
Two new Dion&#8211;Jacobson layered perovskite polymorphs of the known oxyfluoride compound KWO3F are reported. A high&#8208;pressure modification was synthesized using a multianvil setup and subsequently transformed into a high&#8208;temperature phase at &#8764;311&#8201;&#176;C. The crystal structures of both polymorphs were determined by use of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and are described in detail herein. Differential thermal analyses and thermogravimetric analyses were carried out to further investigate the phase transition characteristics. Bond valence (BV) and charge distribution (CHARDI) calculations confirm the occupancy of mixed O|F anion positions, and Rietveld refinements as well as MAPLE calculations support the structure models.

         <title>A Feasible Strategy for a Highly Efficient Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter Over 900&#8201;nm Based on Phenalenone Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel NIR TADF organic emitters, namely OPDC&#8208;DTPA and OPDC&#8208;DBBPA, were first designed and compared in parallel. Neat films of OPDC&#8208;DTPA and OPDC&#8208;DBBPA present real NIR emission with peaks at 962 and 1003&#8197;nm, respectively. Encouragingly, the solution processable doped NIR OLEDs based on OPDC&#8208;DBBPA exhibits a maximum of 0.103&#8201;% with an emission at a peak wavelength of 906&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) suffer from the low external electroluminescence (EL) quantum efficiency (EQE), which is a critical obstacle for potential applications. Herein, 1&#8208;oxo&#8208;1&#8208;phenalene&#8208;2,3&#8208;dicarbonitrile (OPDC) is employed as an electron&#8208;withdrawing aromatic ring, and by incorporating with triphenylamine (TPA) and biphenylphenylamine (BBPA) donors, two novel NIR emitters with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) characteristics, namely OPDC&#8208;DTPA and OPDC&#8208;DBBPA, are first developed and compared in parallel. Intense NIR emission peaks at 962 and 1003&#8197;nm are observed in their pure films, respectively. Contributed by the local excited (LE) characteristics in the triplet (T1) state in synergy with the charge transfer (CT) characteristics for the singlet (S1) state to activate TADF emission, the solution processable doped NIR OLEDs based on OPDC&#8208;DTPA and OPDC&#8208;DBBPA yield EL peaks at 834 and 906&#8197;nm, accompanied with maximum EQEs of 0.457 and 0.103&#8201;%, respectively, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art EL performances in the TADF emitter&#8208;based NIR&#8208;OLEDs in the similar EL emission regions so far. This work manifests a simple and effective strategy for the development of NIR TADF emitters with long wavelength and efficiency synchronously.

         <title>Nms&#8208;Amides: An Amine Protecting Group with Unique Stability and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
p&#8208;Toluenesulfonyl (Tosyl) and nitrobenzenesulfonyl (Nosyl) are two of the most common sulfonyl protecting groups for amines in contemporary organic synthesis. While p&#8208;toluenesulfonamides are known for their high stability and robustness, their use in multistep synthesis is plagued by difficult removal. Nitrobenzenesulfonamides, on the other hand, are easily cleaved but display limited stability to various reaction conditions. In an effort to resolve this conundrum, we herein present Nms&#8208;amides, initially developed through in silico studies, which overcome these previous limitations and leave no room for compromise, enabling a range of transformations that are not possible with traditional sulfonamide protecting groups.







Abstract
p&#8208;Toluenesulfonyl (Tosyl) and nitrobenzenesulfonyl (Nosyl) are two of the most common sulfonyl protecting groups for amines in contemporary organic synthesis. While p&#8208;toluenesulfonamides are known for their high stability/robustness, their use in multistep synthesis is plagued by difficult removal. Nitrobenzenesulfonamides, on the other hand, are easily cleaved but display limited stability to various reaction conditions. In an effort to resolve this predicament, we herein present a new sulfonamide protecting group, which we term Nms. Initially developed through in silico studies, Nms&#8208;amides overcome these previous limitations and leave no room for compromise. We have investigated the incorporation, robustness and cleavability of this group and found it to be superior to traditional sulfonamide protecting groups in a broad range of case studies.

   &lt;b&gt;p&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-Toluenesulfonyl (Tosyl) and nitrobenzenesulfonyl (Nosyl)&lt;/b&gt; are two of the most common sulfonyl protecting groups for amines in contemporary organic synthesis. While &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-toluenesulfonamides are known for their high stability and robustness, their use in multistep synthesis is plagued by difficult removal. Nitrobenzenesulfonamides, on the other hand, are easily cleaved but display limited stability to various reaction conditions. In an effort to resolve this conundrum, we herein present Nms-amides, initially developed through &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; studies, which overcome these previous limitations and leave no room for compromise, enabling a range of transformations that are not possible with traditional sulfonamide protecting groups.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-Toluenesulfonyl (Tosyl) and nitrobenzenesulfonyl (Nosyl) are two of the most common sulfonyl protecting groups for amines in contemporary organic synthesis. While &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-toluenesulfonamides are known for their high stability/robustness, their use in multistep synthesis is plagued by difficult removal. Nitrobenzenesulfonamides, on the other hand, are easily cleaved but display limited stability to various reaction conditions. In an effort to resolve this predicament, we herein present a new sulfonamide protecting group, which we term Nms. Initially developed through in silico studies, Nms-amides overcome these previous limitations and leave no room for compromise. We have investigated the incorporation, robustness and cleavability of this group and found it to be superior to traditional sulfonamide protecting groups in a broad range of case studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Isoform&#8208;Selective Fluorescent Labeling of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#963; by Acrylamide&#8208;Containing Fusicoccins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
14&#8208;3&#8208;3 isoforms and the elucidation of their biological roles: In vitro isoform&#8208;selective fluorescent labeling of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#963; was achieved by a fusicoccin derivative containing a fluorophore and a Cys&#8208;directed acrylamide group. The reaction proceeds upon ternary complex formation with mode&#8208;3 phosphopeptide, which possesses i+1 aliphatic residues.







Abstract
The 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 family of proteins is central to the regulation of signaling pathways driven by serine/threonine kinases. In humans, 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 consists of seven highly conserved isoforms, yet the function of each isoform remains to be fully elucidated. Synthetic agents capable of isoform&#8208;specific fluorescent labeling of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 would provide a useful tool for studying in depth the biological roles of isoforms. In this study, the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#963; isoform was evaluated, which possesses a unique Cys38, and a natural product&#8208;based fluorescent labeling agent was designed by introducing an acrylamide group and a fluorescent dye to fusicoccin (FC). In vitro evaluation demonstrated that 12&#8208;hydroxy 1 and 2 exhibit 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#963; selective labeling activity over 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#950; in the presence of a mode&#8208;3 phospholigand. Furthermore, 2 was shown to label 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#963; in cell lysate in the presence of a C&#8208;terminal mode&#8208;3 phosphopeptide derived from ER&#945;, with no apparent nonspecific labeling. These results indicate that 2 is capable of selective fluorescent detection of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#963; upon binding to mode&#8208;3 phospholigand under biologically relevant conditions.

         <title>Direct C(3)5&#8722;H Polyfluoroarylation of 2&#8208;Amino/alkoxy Pyridines Enabled by a Transient and Electron&#8208;deficient Palladium Intermediate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transiently formed electrophilic polyfluoroaryl&#8208;Pd species overrides the unproductive N&#8208;coordination enabling a remote selective polyfluoroarylation of 2&#8208;amino/alkoxy&#8208;pyridines. The strategy allowed rapid construction of polyfluorinated heterobiaryls containing bioactive molecules and drug derivatives in good yields.







Abstract
Herein, we present an unprecedented azine&#8208;limited C5&#8722;H polyfluoroarylation of 2&#8208;aminopyridines enabled by a transient and electron&#8208;deficient perfluoroaryl&#8208;Pd species via C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H coupling. The protocol further allows C3(5)&#8722;H polyfluoroarylation of 2&#8208;alkoxypyridines guided by sterics and electronics for the first time. The late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization of drugs, drug derivatives, and natural product derivatives and synthesis of C5&#8208;aryl drug derivatives further demonstrated the method's utility. The preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that the synergistic combination of the bulky yet electrophilic perfluoroaryl&#8208;Pd species and the partial nucleophilicity of the C5&#8208;position of 2&#8208;amino/alkoxy&#8208;pyridines is the origin of reactivity and selectivity. Importantly, the first experimental evidence for the role of diisopropyl sulfide is provided.

         <title>Low&#8208;Pressure Sensitive Piezochromic Fluorescence Switching of Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;Anthraquinone</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly sensitive piezochromic fluorescent switching under low&#8208;pressure regimes (&#8764;60&#8197;kPa) of tetraphenylethylene&#8208;anthraquinone (TPE&#8208;AQ) is based on the controlled molecular design and polymorphic crystal strategy. The underlying mechanism of the low&#8208;pressure sensitive piezochromic fluorescence switching is demonstrated to be closely related to the loosely packed molecular orientation.







Abstract
Sensing of low&#8208;pressure signals is of great importance for cutting&#8208;edge technologies. Organic piezochromic molecules offer a promising library of pressure sensitive materials which can be tailor&#8208;designed toward specific requirements. However, very few examples of low&#8208;pressure sensitive piezochromic fluorescent molecules have been obtained till date, and the underlying mechanisms are still in its infancy. Herein, we report highly sensitive piezochromic fluorescent switching under low&#8208;pressure regimes (&#8764;60&#8197;kPa) of tetraphenylethylene&#8208;anthraquinone (TPE&#8208;AQ) based on the controlled molecular design and polymorphic phase strategy. The influence of both intramolecular conformation effect and variations of intermolecular stacking modes on the piezochromic property of TPE&#8208;AQ is investigated. The underlying mechanism of the low&#8208;pressure sensitive piezochromic fluorescence switching is demonstrated to be closely related to the loosely packed molecular orientation, as confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements combined with simulations. This work provides a way to design highly efficient pressure sensors based on organic molecular systems.

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Diastereomerically Pure Titanocenes by Dynamic Conformational Locking</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: The synthesis of enantiomerically pure titanocenes is limited to cases with enantiomerically pure substituents at the cyclopentadienyl ligands and to ansa&#8208;titanocenes. For the latter complexes, the use of achiral ligands requires a resolution of enantiomers and frequently also a separation of the diastereoisomers obtained after metalation. Here, we introduce a new synthetic method that relies on the use of enantiomerically pure camphorsulfonate (CSA) ligands as control elements for the absolute and relative configuration of titanocene complexes. Starting from the conformationally flexible (RC5H4)2TiCl2, the desired conformationally locked and hence enantio&#8208; and diastereomerically pure complexes (RC5H4)2Ti(CSA)2 are obtained in just two steps. According to X&#8208;ray crystallography the (RC5H4)2Ti fragment is essentially C2&#8208;symmetric and nuclear magnetic resonance displays overall C2&#8208;symmetry. We applied density functional theory methods to unravel the dynamics of the complexes and the mechanisms and selectivities of their formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;Mediated Cyclizations of Triene&#8208;Yne Systems: an Easy Access to Cyclopenta&#8208;Fused Anthracenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct synthesis of cyclopenta&#8208;fused anthracenes (CP&#8208;anthracenes) through a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction of easily available triene&#8208;yne systems bearing a benzofulvene substructure, is reported. The targets are of great interest due to the potential use as organic materials, as well as in the field of biological chemistry and the preparation of these compounds is gaining huge importance. The applied starting materials are readily available through a 3&#8208;step synthesis, which further contributes to the advantages of this route. In addition, UV&#8208;Vis and fluorescent spectra of the obtained CP&#8208;anthracenes were recorded.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;pot Synthesis of Helical Azaheptalene and Chiroptical Switching of an Isolable Radical Cation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A nitrogen&#8208;centered heptalene, azaheptalene, was designed as a representative of a new class of redox&#8208;responsive molecules with a large steric strain that originates from the adjacent seven&#8208;membered rings. The pentabenzo derivative of azaheptalene was efficiently synthesized by a palladium&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot reaction of commercially available reagents. Bromination led to mono&#8208; and dibrominated derivatives, the latter of which is interconvertible with isolable radical cation species exhibiting near&#8208;infrared absorption. Since the azaheptalene skeleton shows configurationally stable helicity with a large torsion angle, enantiomers could be successfully separated. Thus, optically pure azaheptalenes with P&#8208; or M&#8208;helicity showed strong chiroptical properties (|gabs| &#8805; 0.01), which could be changed by an electric potential.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemodivergent tandem radical cyclization offers exciting possibilities for the synthesis of structurally diverse cyclic compounds. Herein, we revealed a chemodivergent tandem cyclization of alkene substituted quinazolinones under metal&#8208; and base&#8208;free system, this transformation is initiated by alkyl radicals produced from oxidant&#8208;induced &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization of alkyl nitriles or esters. The reaction resulted in the selective synthesis of a series of mono&#8208; and di&#8208;alkylated ring&#8208;fused quinazolinones by modulating the loading of oxidant, reaction temperature, and reaction time. Mechanistic investigations show that the mono&#8208;alkylated ring&#8208;fused quinazolinones is constructed by the key process of 1,2&#8208;hydrogen shift, while the di&#8208;alkylated ring&#8208;fused quinazolinones is mainly achieved through crucial steps of spin delocalization and proton transfer. This protocol is the first example of remote second alkylation on the aromatic ring via &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization and difunctionalization achieved by association of two unsaturated bonds in radical cyclization.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioenriched Boron C,N&#8208;Chelates via Chirality Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chirality transfer strategy was established to access enantioenriched boron C,N&#8208;chelates stereogenic only at the B&#8208;atom. First, a library of chiral boron O,N&#8208;complexes was synthesized in diastereoselective fashion. The generated stereoinformation at boron was then transferred via the ate&#8208;complex into the boron C,N&#8208;chelates.Twitter affiliations: @LaschatGroup, @YStoeckl







Abstract
Molecules stereogenic only at tetrahedral boron atoms show great promise for applications, for example as chiroptical materials, but are scarcely investigated due to their synthetic challenge. Hence, this study reports a two&#8208;step synthesis of enantioenriched boron C,N&#8208;chelates. First, the diastereoselective complexation of alkyl/aryl borinates with chiral aminoalcohols furnished boron stereogenic heterocycles in up to 86&#8201;% yield and d.r. &gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;2. Treatment of these O,N&#8208;complexes with chelate nucleophiles was surmised to transfer the stereoinformation via the ate&#8208;complex into the C,N&#8208;products. This chirality transfer succeeded by substitution of the O,N&#8208;chelates with lithiated phenyl pyridine to give boron stereogenic C,N&#8208;chelates in up to 84&#8201;% yield and e.r. up to 97&#8201;:&#8201;3. The chiral aminoalcohol ligands could be recovered after isolation of the C,N&#8208;chelates. The chirality transfer tolerated alkyl, alkynyl and (hetero&#8208;)aryl moieties at boron and could be further extended by post&#8208;modification: transformations such as catalytic hydrogenations or sequential deprotonation/electrophilic trapping were feasible while maintaining the stereochemical integrity of the C,N&#8208;chelates. Structural aspects of the boron chelates were studied by variable temperature NMR and X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Ionic Liquids and Electrolytes with Flexible Aromatic Anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural analogous ionic liquids (ILs) and electrolytes comprising oligoether&#8208;based flexible aromatic anions offer different physicochemical properties. The designed ILs and the electrolytes are fluorine&#8208;free and have better physicochemical properties than conventional electrolytes and have a great potential to be used as electrolytes in next generation batteries, in particular those operating at elevated temperatures and with limited electrochemical stability window.







Abstract
Five new n&#8208;tetrabutylphosphonium (P4444)+ cation&#8208;based ionic liquids (ILs) with oligoether substituted aromatic carboxylate anions have been synthesized. The nature and position of the oligoether chain affect thermal stability (up to 330&#8201;&#176;C), phase behaviour (Tg&lt;&#8722;55&#8201;&#176;C) and ion transport. Furthermore, with the aim of application in lithium batteries, electrolytes were created for two of the ILs by 10&#8197;mol% doping using the corresponding Li&#8208;salts. This affects the ion diffusion negatively, from being higher and equal for cations and anions to lower for all ions and unequal. This is due to the stronger ionic interactions and formation of aggregates, primarily between the Li+ ions and the carboxylate group of the anions. Electrochemically, the electrolytes have electrochemical stability windows up to 3.5&#8197;V, giving some promise for battery application.

         <title>Extended Light Absorption and Improved Charge Separation by Protonation of the Organic Ligand in a Bismuth&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protonation of the nitrogen in the thiazole ring, which acts as the organic ligand of Bi&#8208;based MOF (Bi&#8208;MMTAA), results in a pronounced redshift in light absorption. This protonation also accelerates charge separation and transfer and ultimately improves photocatalytic performance.







Abstract
In this work, a new method to extend the light absorption and improve the photocatalytic activity of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with nitrogen&#8208;containing ligand is reported, namely, the protonation of nitrogen. Specifically, a protonated Bi&#8208;based MOF synthesized by a hydrothermal method (Bi&#8208;MMTAA&#8208;H, MMTAA=2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;4&#8208;methyl&#8208;5&#8208;thiazoleacetic acid) displays a wider visible light absorption than Bi&#8208;MMTAA&#8208;R with the same single&#8208;crystal structure, but synthesized by a reflux method. The redshifted light absorption was confirmed to be caused by the protonation of nitrogen in the thiazolyl ring in MMTAA.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Protonation of the nitrogen&lt;/b&gt; in the thiazole ring, which acts as the organic ligand of Bi-based MOF (Bi-MMTAA), results in a pronounced redshift in light absorption. This protonation also accelerates charge separation and transfer and ultimately improves photocatalytic performance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, a new method to extend the light absorption and improve the photocatalytic activity of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with nitrogen-containing ligand is reported, namely, the protonation of nitrogen. Specifically, a protonated Bi-based MOF synthesized by a hydrothermal method (Bi-MMTAA-H, MMTAA=2-mercapto-4-methyl-5-thiazoleacetic acid) displays a wider visible light absorption than Bi-MMTAA-R with the same single-crystal structure, but synthesized by a reflux method. The redshifted light absorption was confirmed to be caused by the protonation of nitrogen in the thiazolyl ring in MMTAA. Moreover, this protonation also facilitates the charge separation and transfer and improves the photocatalytic activity of selective oxidation of &#945;-terpinene to &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-cymene. Our results provide a new idea for nitrogen-containing Bi-based MOFs to extend the light absorption and improve the photocatalytic performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tf2O&#8208;Catalyzed Tandem Cyclization/Trifluoromethylselenolation of Alkynes for Synthesis of CF3Se&#8208;Containing Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and practical Tf2O&#8208;catalyzed tandem cyclization/trifluoromethylselenolation of alkynes with EtOH as the green solvent was developed. Various CF3Se&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds, including indoles, benzofurans, benzothiophenes, isoquinolines and chromenes have been synthesized with trifluoromethyl selenoxides as CF3Se source.







Abstract
Herein, the tandem synthesis of various CF3Se&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds has been developed, using Tf2O as the catalyst and trifluoromethyl selenoxides as the electrophilic trifluoromethylselenolation reagents. This process is characterized by its mild conditions, ease of operation, and good functional group compatibility. A variety of alkynes could be transferred into CF3Se&#8208;containing indoles, benzofurans, benzothiophenes, isoquinolines and chromenes in good yields. A key step involving the formation of the electrophilic CF3Se species was proposed.

         <title>Synthesis and Crystallographic Characterization of Helical Hairpin Oligourea Foldamers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Foldamer hairpin&#8208;like motifs have been prepared by connecting oligourea helices with various alkyl and aralkyl linkers, and their structures were determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Some specific geometrical parameters like interhelical dihedral angles and helical twists were measured, thus allowing precise comparison between the different supersecondary structures. More information can be found in the Research Article by C. Dolain, G. Guichard and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300087). Artwork by Christel Dolain.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Enantiomerically Pure P&#8208;Chiral 1&#8208;Alkoxy&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophospholes via Nucleophilic P&#8208;N Bond Cleavage of a 1&#8208;Phospha&#8208;2&#8208;azanorbornene</title>

One cleavage &#8208; many possibilities: A straightforward one&#8208;pot synthesis of enantiopure P&#8208;chiral 1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophospholes has been established via a nucleophilic P&#8722;N bond cleavage of 1&#8208;phospha&#8208;2&#8208;azanorbornene (PAN). The procedure can be modified to give &#8220;custom&#8208;made&#8221; ligands by selecting various nucleophiles and PAN derivatives to control the steric and electronic properties. Phosphorus(III) compounds derived from this procedure are expected to be effective ligands in asymmetric homogeneous catalysis.







Abstract
The reactive P&#8722;N bond in a racemic mixture of endo&#8208;1&#8208;phospha&#8208;2&#8208;azanorbornene (PAN) (RP/SP)&#8208;endo&#8208;1 is readily cleaved with enantiomerically pure lithium alkoxides followed by protonation to afford diastereomeric mixtures of P&#8208;chiral 1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophosphole derivatives. The isolation of these compounds is rather challenging due to the reversibility of the reaction (elimination of alcohols). However, methylation of the sulfonamide moiety of the intermediate lithium salts and sulfur protection of the phosphorus atom prevent the elimination reaction. The resulting air&#8208;stable P&#8208;chiral diastereomeric 1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophosphole sulfide mixtures can be readily isolated and fully characterized. The diastereomers can be separated by crystallization. The 1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophosphole sulfides are readily reduced with Raney nickel to afford phosphorus(III) P&#8208;stereogenic 1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophospholes with potential use in asymmetric homogeneous transition metal catalysis.

         <title>Unimolecular Reactivity of [Cu(R)(CF3)3]&#8722; Complexes (R=Organyl): Stepwise versus Concerted Mechanism in Copper&#8208;Mediated Trifluoromethylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of gas&#8208;phase fragmentation experiments and quantum chemical calculations affords detailed insight into the reactivity of high&#8208;valent trifluoromethylated cuprate complexes. Depending on the nature of the organyl group R, these key intermediates of synthetically valuable trifluoromethylation reactions lose two radicals or undergo concerted reductive eliminations.







Abstract
The cuprate complexes [Cu(R)(CF3)3]&#8722; (R=organyl) offer an efficient synthetic access to valuable trifluoromethylation products RCF3. Here, electrospray&#8208;ionization mass spectrometry is used to analyze the formation of these intermediates in solution and probe their fragmentation pathways in the gas phase. Furthermore, the potential energy surfaces of these systems are explored by quantum chemical calculations. Upon collisional activation, the [Cu(R)(CF3)3]&#8722; complexes (R=Me, Et, Bu, sBu, allyl) afford the product ions [Cu(CF3)3]&#8901;&#8722; and [Cu(CF3)2]&#8722;. The former obviously results from an R&#8901; loss, whereas the latter originates either from the stepwise release of R&#8901; and CF3&#8901; radicals or a concerted reductive elimination of RCF3. The gas&#8208;phase fragmentation experiments as well as the quantum chemical calculations indicate that the preference for the stepwise reaction toward [Cu(CF3)2]&#8722; increases with the stability of the formed organyl radical R&#8901;. This finding suggests that the recombination of R&#8901; and CF3&#8901; radicals may possibly contribute to the formation of RCF3 from [Cu(R)(CF3)3]&#8722; in synthetic applications. In contrast, the [Cu(R)(CF3)3]&#8722; complexes (R=aryl) only yield [Cu(CF3)2]&#8722; when subjected to collision&#8208;induced dissociation. These species exclusively undergo a concerted reductive elimination because the competing stepwise pathway is disfavored by the low stability of aryl radicals.

         <dc:description>
This concept article provides new opportuinies of employing metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) as solid platforms to activate small molecules like hydrogen due to intrinsic sites in MOFs that behave as frustrated Lewis acid&#8208;base pairs, thus featuring new avenues for heterogeneous catalysis using MOFs as solid catalysts.New Opportunities in Metal&#8211;organic Framework Catalysis: From Bifunctional to Frustrated Lewis Pairs Catalysis (Garcia, Dhakshinamoorthy, and Asiri)







Abstract
This article highlights novel prospects for metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) in heterogeneous catalysis as having frustrated Lewis acid&#8208;base pairs (FLPs) or as bifunctional acid&#8208;base solid catalysts able to activate molecular hydrogen. Starting from the extensive application MOFs as Lewis acid and Lewis base catalysts, this article uses catalytic hydrogenation to briefly summarize the efforts made to heterogenize boron and amine in MOFs to mimic molecular FLP systems. The core of this concept is based on recent findings which demonstrate the ability of two commonly used MOFs, namely UiO&#8208;66 and MIL&#8208;101, to catalyze the selective hydrogenation of polar double X=Y bonds at moderate H2 pressures below 10&#8197;bar. The influence of electron&#8208;donating, the withdrawal of substituents on the linker, and the aniline poisoning effect highlight the significance of Lewis acid sites, while density&#8208;functional theory calculations indicate the heterolytic H&#8722;H bond cleavage at the MOF metal oxo clusters. It is expected that this new perspective on MOFs as solid FLP systems will spur further research to explore and define the potential of dual sites in the catalytic activation of small molecules.

         <title>Stereochemically Active Tin(II)&#8208;Induced Enhancement of Birefringence in SnIISnIV(PO4)2 and SrSn(PO4)PO2(OH)2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new tin(II) phosphates SnIISnIV(PO4)2 and SrSn(PO4)PO2(OH)2 exhibit enhanced birefringence by introducing the tin(II) ions with stereochemically active lone pairs. And in particular for SrSn(PO4)PO2(OH)2, the hydrogen groups facilitate more aligned Sn2+&#8208;centered oxygen polyhedra. Moreover, the UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR diffuse reflectance measurement further indicates that their cut off edges are 262 and 263&#8197;nm, which can be used as a new UV birefringent crystal.







Abstract
Two new tin(II) phosphates, SnIISnIV(PO4)2 and SrSn(PO4)PO2(OH)2, were synthesized by the high&#8208;temperature solution method and hydrothermal method, respectively. Theoretical study indicates that by introducing tin(II) with stereochemical activity lone pairs (SCALP) in metal phosphates, the birefringence was enhanced, 0.048@1064&#8197;nm for SnIISnIV(PO4)2 and 0.080@1064&#8197;nm for SrSn(PO4)PO2(OH)2.

         <title>[2+4] Cycloaddition Product of an Amidinate Substituted Dialumene with Toluene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transient dialumene based on an amidinate scaffold was synthesized. The complex was isolated as a cycloaddition product with toluene. The mechanism of the reaction investigated using the DFT method indicates a free energy barrier of 0.9&#8197;kcal/mol with respect to the monomeric AlI intermediate.







Abstract
Reduction of LAlI2 (L=PhC(NiPr2C6H3)2) with two equivalents of KC8 in toluene affords the [2+4]cycloaddition product of a dialumene with toluene. The mechanism for the formation of product complex was investigated using density functional theory (DFT) methods.

         <title>Allosteric Tuning of Caspase&#8208;7: Establishing the Nexus of Structure and Catalytic Power</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mapping the constellation of structural and dynamic changes concurrent with allosteric inhibitor binding to caspase&#8208;7, also known as allosteric structure&#8211;activity relationships (ASARs), reveals the nexus between the active site and the remote allosteric pocket. These ASARs also elucidate the link between structure and catalytic power for caspase&#8208;7. Our insights from exploration of caspase&#8208;7 allostery offer a new path for navigating allosteric drug discovery. More information can be found in the Research Article by M.&#8197;A. Spies and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300872).

Here we report on photogeneration of triplet ethynylarsinidene, HCCAs, and triplet ethynylstibinidene, HCCSb, from ethynylarsine and ethynylstibine, respectively, in solid argon matrices. The products were identified using infrared spectroscopy and the associated UV absorption spectra are interpreted with the aid of theoretical predictions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Among the general interest in fluorinated compounds, trifluoromethoxylated molecules play a specific role. However, despite this interest, the development of efficient reagents to perform trilfuoromethoxylation reactions remains a challenge. Here, 2,4dinitro&#8208;trifluoromethoxybenzene (DNTFB) is used as a trifluoromethoxylating reagent to perform nucleophilic substitution under mild metal&#8208;free conditions with different leaving groups, including direct dehydroxytrifluoromethoxylation. A mechanistic study rationalized the reaction and subsequently proposed only three reaction conditions, depending on the reactivity of the starting substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Rubicene&#8208;Based Aromatic &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Compounds as Five&#8208;Membered Ring Embedded Planar Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons consisting of two or three rubicene substructures were designed as &#960;&#8208;conjugated compounds embedding five&#8208;membered rings. The target compounds with t&#8208;butyl groups were synthesized by the Scholl reactions of precursors consisting of 9,10&#8208;diphenylanthracene units, even though a partially precyclized precursor was required for the synthesis of the trimer. These compounds were isolated as stable and dark blue solids. The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis and the DFT calculations revealed the planar aromatic frameworks. In the electronic spectra, the absorption and emission bands considerably red&#8208;shifted compared with those of the reference rubicene compound. In particular, the emission band of the trimer extended to the near&#8208;IR region while retaining the emissive property. The narrowed HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap with the extension of the &#960;&#8208;conjugation was confirmed by cyclic voltammetry and DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective Ir&#8208;catalyzed C8&#8208;H borylation of 4&#8208;quinolones via transient O&#8208;borylated quinolines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 4&#8208;hydroxyquinoline/4&#8208;quinolone tautomerization has been harnessed to achieve directed, regioselective C8&#8208;borylation of biologically important 4&#8208;quinolones. Introduced as the 4&#8208;quinolone, the O&#8208;borylated quinoline is initially formed. Critically, the newly&#8208;formed 4&#8208;(pinBO)&#8208;quinolines then undergoes Ir&#8208;catalysed, N&#8208;directed, selective C&#8208;H functionalization/borylation at C8. Hydrolysis of the OBpin moiety on workup returns the system to the 4&#8208;quinolone tautomer. The C8&#8208;borylated quinolines were converted to their corresponding potassium trifluoroborate (BF3K) salts and to their C8&#8208;chlorinated quinolone derivatives. The two&#8208;step C&#8208;H functionalization/borylation&#8208;chlorination reaction sequence resulted in various C8&#8208;Cl quinolones in good yields. Conversion to C8&#8208;OH, C8&#8208;NH2 and C8&#8208;Ar substituted quinolones was also feasible using this methodology.</dc:description>

         <title>Degradation of penicillinic antibiotics and &#946;&#8208;lactamase enzymatic catalysis in a biomimetic Zn&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#946;&#8208;lactam antibiotics are one of the most commonly prescribed drugs to treat bacterial infections. However, their use has been somehow limited given the emergence of bacteria with resistance mechanisms, such as &#946;&#8208;lactamases, which inactivate them by degrading their four membered beta&#8208;lactam&#160;rings.&#160;So, a total knowledge of the mechanisms governing the catalytic activity of &#946;&#8208;lactamases is required. Here, we report a novel Zn&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF, 1), possessing functional channels capable to accommodate and interact with antibiotics, which catalyze the selective hydrolysis of the penicillinic antibiotics amoxicillin and ceftriaxone. In particular, MOF 1 degrades, very efficiently, the four membered &#946;&#8208;lactam ring of amoxicillin, acting as a &#946;&#8208;lactamase mimic, and expands the very limited number of MOFs capable to mimic catalytic enzymatic processes. Combined single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) studies and density functional (DFT) calculations offer unique snapshots on the host guest&#8208;interactions established between amoxicillin and the functional channels of 1. This allows to propose a degradation mechanism based on the activation of a water molecule, promoted by a Zn&#8208;bridging hydroxyl group, concertedly to the nucleophilic attack to the carbonyl moiety and the cleaving of C&#8208;N bond of the lactam ring.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Role of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Salts in Alkyl Radical Generation from Alkyl Alcohols: A Computational Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of carbon centered radical generation from alkyl alcohols mediated by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene salts has been explored computationally for 7 different NHCs. The influence of the electronic properties for each mechanistic step is rationalized and has been proven to be key for reactivity.







Abstract
Formation of carbon&#8208;carbon bonds through cross&#8208;coupling reactions using readily available substrates, like alcohols, is crucial for modern organic chemistry. Recently, direct alkyl alcohol functionalization has been achieved by the use of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) salts via in&#8197;situ formation of an alcohol&#8208;NHC adduct and its activation by a photoredox catalyst to generate carbon&#8208;centered alkyl radicals. Experimentally, only electron deficient NHC activators work but the reasons of this behavior remain underexplored. Herein, a DFT computational study of the mechanism of alcohol activation using up to seven NHC salts is performed to shed light into the influence of their electronic properties in the alkyl radical formation. This study demonstrates that four reaction steps are involved in the transformation and characterizes how the electronic properties of the NHC salt affect each step. A fine balance of the NHC electron&#8208;richness is proved to be determinant for this transformation.

         <title>Constructing pH&#8208;Responsive and Tunable Azo&#8208;Phenol&#8208;Based o&#8208;Nitrobenzyl Photocages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
pH&#8208;sensitive phenolic groups can be attached to the o&#8208;nitrobenzyl (oNB) group to form azo&#8208;phenolic NPX photocages with tunable pKa. One of the photocages in this study, NPdiCl, is identified as a promising pH&#8208;responsive photocage for photoreleasing cargo inside acidic tumor cells.







Abstract
Multiple triggered&#8208;release strategies are widely utilized to control the release of caged target molecules. Among them, photocages with conditional triggers provide extra layers of control in photorelease. In this work, a series of pH&#8208;responsive photocages was designed that could be triggered under irradiation and specific intracellular pH values. pH&#8208;sensitive phenolic groups were conjugated with o&#8208;nitrobenzyl (oNB) to form azo&#8208;phenolic NPX photocages with tunable pKa. These azo&#8208;phenol&#8208;based oNB photocages showed differentiable photoreleasing profiles at pH&#8197;5.0, 7.2 and 9.0. By attaching fluorogenic cargos, it was shown that one of the photocages, NPdiCl, could be used to differentiate between acidic pH&#8197;5.0 and neutral pH&#8197;7.2 in cells under artificial pH conditions. Finally, NPdiCl was identified as a promising pH&#8208;responsive photocage for photoreleasing cargo inside acidic tumor cells.

         <title>Comparison of Antiaromatic Properties in a Series of Structurally Isomeric Naphthothiophene&#8208;Fused s&#8208;Indacenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work compares six antiaromatic naphthothiophene&#8208;fused s&#8208;indacene isomers through computational methods (NICS&#8208;XY scans) and experimental techniques (NMR, UV&#8208;vis, CV, and SC&#8208;XRD).







Abstract
Fusion of aromatic subunits to stabilize an antiaromatic core allows the isolation and study of otherwise unstable paratropic systems. A complete study of a series of six naphthothiophene&#8208;fused s&#8208;indacene isomers is herein described. Additionally, the structural modifications resulted in increased &#960;&#8211;&#960; overlap in the solid state, which was further explored through changing the sterically blocking mesityl group to (triisopropylsilyl)ethynyl in three derivatives. The computed antiaromaticity of the six isomers is compared to the observed physical properties, such as NMR chemical shift, UV&#8208;vis, and CV data. We find that the calculations predict the most antiaromatic isomer and give a general estimation of the relative degree of paratropicity for the remaining isomers, when compared to the experimental results.

         <title>Lead&#8208;Free Double Perovskite Semiconductor with Rigid Spacer&#8208;Induced High&#8208;Tc Dielectric Switch Features</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifunctional material (benzylammonium)4AgBiBr8, which has a step&#8208;like dielectric phase transition at 383&#8197;K/387&#8197;K (cooling/heating) and excellent photoelectric properties, was obtained by using rigid benzylammonium cations as templates.







Abstract
Layered hybrid perovskites possess exceptional semiconductor features and structural versality, making them viable candidates for developing multifunctional dielectric phase&#8208;transition materials (PTMS). However, most PTMs based on layered hybrid perovskites still suffer from Pb toxicity and low operating temperature. The recently developed hybrid double perovskites provide a new routine to designed PTMs with desired working performance and environment&#8208;friendly chemical compositions. Herein, using rigid aromatic cations as templates, we have successfully synthesized a novel double perovskite (benzylammonium)4AgBiBr8 (1), which consists of corner&#8208;sharing AgBr6 and BiBr6 layers and benzylammonium cations. Notably, 1 exhibits a high&#8208;temperature first&#8208;order reversible solid&#8208;state phase transition at 383/387&#8197;K (cooling/heating) and switchable dielectric performance around the temperature. Compared with the soft organic chain version of the compound, the phase transition temperature of 1 shows a large enhancement of 99&#8197;K, validating the correctness of the designing strategy. In addition, 1 also exhibits semiconductor characteristics with a calculated bandgap of 2.34&#8197;eV and an optical bandgap of 2.29&#8197;eV. Remarkably, the single crystal photodetector of 1 shows a low dark current (2.12&#215;10&#8722;13&#8197;A), a high on/off ratio (1.77&#215;103), and a fast response (&#964;rise=125&#8197;&#956;s and &#964;decay=419&#8197;&#956;s). Such a lead&#8208;free phase transition material combined with semiconductor properties provides a new strategy to develop environmentally friendly multifunctional materials.

         <title>Structure&#8208;induced Intelligence of Liquid Crystal Elastomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are active soft matter&#8208;based materials with strong stimulus responsiveness and reversible, large&#8208;shape morphing capabilities. The actuation intelligence and advanced functionality of LCEs depend on the smartness and properties of structures. In this review, we discuss recent advances in structure&#8208;induced intelligence of LCEs, specifically the integration of structural properties with the alignment and processing of LCEs.







Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are active soft matter&#8208;based materials with strong stimulus responsiveness and reversible, large&#8208;shape morphing capabilities. LCEs have demonstrated broad and growing applications in soft robotics, wearable devices, artificial muscles, and optical machines. The actuation intelligence and advanced functionality of LCEs depend on the smartness and properties of structures. In this review, we discuss recent advances in structure&#8208;induced intelligence of LCEs, specifically the integration of structural properties with the alignment and processing of LCEs. The structural design principles for three categories consisting of common structures (film, fiber, and tubule), smart structures (origami, kirigami, mechanical metamaterial, topology, and topography), and complex structures (monolithic and integrated) are presented. Various alignment controls of LCEs, including mechanical, surface, field&#8208;assisted, and shear alignment, are capable of inducing structural properties. The coupling and collaboration mechanisms of the LCE structures and the generated functions are discussed. The review concludes with perspectives on current challenges and emerging opportunities.

         <title>Expanding the Substrate Scope of Acyltransferase LovD9 for the Biosynthesis of Statin Analogues</title>

         <dc:description>
This study unveils the substrate promiscuity of acyltransferase LovD9, which turns to be very efficient by accepting vinyl and p&#8208;nitrophenyl derivatives as acyl donors for the obtaining of statin analogues.







Abstract
This study identifies new acyl donors for manufacturing statin analogues through the acylation of monacolin J acid by the laboratory evolved acyltransferase LovD9. Vinyl and p&#8208;nitrophenyl esters have emerged as alternate substrates for LovD9&#8208;catalyzed acylation. While vinyl esters can reach product yields as high as the ones obtained by &#945;&#8208;dimethyl butyryl&#8208;S&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;mercaptopropionate (DMB&#8208;SMMP), the thioester for which LovD9 was evolved, p&#8208;nitrophenyl esters display a reactivity even higher than DMB&#8208;SMMP for the first acylation step yet the acylation product yield is lower. The reaction mechanisms were elucidated through quantum mechanics (QM) calculations.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Aryl and Alkenyl Halides from Fluorosulfonates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relevance of aryl fluorosulfonates in coupling reactions has increased over the past decade. Surprisingly, the use and synthesis of alkenyl fluorosulfonates is still poorly described. In this paper, the advantageous use of aryl and alkenyl fluorosulfonates instead of the corresponding triflates is reported to synthesize aryl and alkenyl halides using halide salts and commercially available ruthenium catalysts.







Abstract
Aryl and alkenyl halides are widely used as key intermediates in organic synthesis, particularly for the formation of organometallic reagents or as radical precursors. They are also found in pharmaceutical and agrochemical ingredients. In this work, the synthesis of aryl and alkenyl halides from the corresponding fluorosulfonates using commercially available ruthenium catalysts is reported. Notably, this is the first conversion of phenols to aryl halides that is efficient with chloride, bromide, and iodide. Fluorosulfonates are readily prepared using sulfuryl fluoride (SO2F2) and less expensive substitutes for triflates. Although aryl fluorosulfonates and their reactions are well known, this is the first report of an efficient coupling of alkenyl fluorosulfonates. To finish, it was demonstrated, by means of representative examples, that the reaction is possible in a one&#8208;pot process, starting directly from phenol or aldehyde.

         <title>Spectroscopic and Computational Study of Organocatalytic Umpolung of Bromocations: An Accelerated Stereoselective Dibromination Protocol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, organocatalytically achieved polarity reversal of cationic bromine, is presented. The proven bromocation source N&#8208;bromosuccinimide (NBS) was converted to a superior bromoanion reagent by H/Br exchange with a secondary amine, substantiated with spectroscopic and computational evidences. The concept has further been used in a successful accelerated organocatalyzed dibromination of olefins in a non&#8208;hazardous, commercially viable process with a wide range of substrate scope. The reactivity of key entities observed through NMR kinetics and reaction acceleration using only 10 mol% of catalyst, account for its major success. The nucleophilicity of the bromoanion was found to be superior in comparison to other nucleophiles such as MeOH, H2O and the protocol dominates over competing allylic bromination reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Dissymmetric Triaryltriazines: Small Mass Columnar Glasses</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Columnar liquid crystals with very small molecular masses that form anisotropic glasses well above room temperature are obtained by mixed dissymmetric substitution of sym&#8208;triazine with ester&#8208;bearing phenyl and phenanthryl or tetrahelicenyl moieties. The combination of low molecular symmetry with configurational flexibility and short polar ester moieties stabilizes the mesophase over large temperature ranges and induces pronounced calorimetric glass transitions within the anisotropic fluid despite the smallness of the molecules. In contrast to more symmetrical homologs, no ester tails longer than ethyl are necessary to induce the liquid crystalline state, allowing for the near&#8208;absence of any insulating and weight&#8208;increasing alkyl periphery. Films drop&#8208;cast from solution show in all cases emission spectra that do not show significant change of fluorescence emission upon annealing, indicating that the columnar hexagonal mesoscopic order is obtained directly upon deposition from solution and is resistant to crystallization upon annealing.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Magnetic Relaxations of Cyano&#8208;Bridged {DyIIIMoV} Systems by Tuning the N&#8208;Sites in &#946;&#8208;diketone Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyano&#8208;bridged 4d&#8722;4f molecular nanomagnets have re&#8208;called increasing research interests in molecular magnetism since they bring more possibilities in achieving novel nanomagnets with versatile structures and magnetic interactions. In this work, to tune the magnetic relaxation behaviors of cyano&#8208;bridged {DyIIIMoV} systems, four&#160;&#946;&#8208;diketone ligands bearing different substitution N&#8208;sites were designed and synthesized, namely 1&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;3&#8208;(3&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;propanedione (HL1), 1,3&#8208;Bis(3&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;propanedione (HL2), 1&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;3&#8208;(3&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;propanedione (HL3) and 1,3&#8208;Bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;propanedione (HL4). By reacting with DyCl3&#183;6H2O and K4Mo(CN)8&#183;2H2O,&#160;four cyano&#8208;bridged complexes, namely {[Dy[MoV(CN)8](HL1)2(H2O)3]}&#183;6H2O (1), {[Dy[MoV(CN)8](HL2)(H2O)3(CH3OH)]}2&#183;2CH3OH&#183;3H2O (2), {[Dy[MoV(CN)8]3(HL3)(H2O)2(CH3OH)]&#183;H2O}n&#160;(3) and {[Dy[MoV(CN)8](HL4)2(H2O)3]}&#183;2H2O&#183;CH3OH (4) were obtained. Structural analyses revealed that&#160;1&#160;and&#160;4&#160;are binuclear complexes,&#160;2&#160;has a tetragonal structure, and&#160;3&#160;exhibits a stair&#8208;like polymer chain structure. The DyIII&#160;ions in all complexes have eight&#8208;coordinated configurations with the coordination spheres DyO7N1&#160;for&#160;1&#160;and&#160;4, DyO6N2&#160;for&#160;2, and DyO5N3&#160;for&#160;3. Magnetic measurements indicated that&#160;1&#160;is a zero&#8208;field single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) and complexes&#160;2&#8722;4&#160;are field&#8208;induced SMMs, with complex&#160;4&#160;featuring a two&#8208;step relaxation process. The magnetic characterizations and&#160;ab initio&#160;calculations revealed that changing the N&#8208;sites in the&#160;&#946;&#8208;diketone ligands can effectively alter the structures and magnetic properties of cyano&#8208;bridged 4d&#8722;4f nanomagnets by adjusting the coordination environments of the DyIII&#160;centers.</dc:description>

         <title>Electron&#8208;precise Dicationic Tetraboranes: Syntheses, Structures and Rearrangement to a Alkylidene Borate&#8208;Borenium Zwitterion and a 1,3&#8208;Azaborinine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbene&#8208;stabilized symmetrical and unsymmetrical dicationic tetraboranes, featuring an electron&#8208;precise tetraboron chain, were synthesized and fully characterized. Reactions of these tetraboranes with reductants/bases give rise to different outcomes according to the conditions employed, including: 1) reduction and rearrangement of the tetraborane chain to give a zwitterionic alkylidene borate&#8208;borenium species; 2) cleavage of the tetraborane chain to afford a 1,3&#8208;azaborinine; and 3) reduction of the supporting ligands to provide a diamino dipotassium salt. The zwitterionic alkylidene borate&#8208;borenium can be viewed as an analogue of the base&#8208;stabilized diborenes. NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations reveal a highly polarized B&#8208;B bond in the zwitterionic alkylidene borate&#8208;borenium, in which the formal oxidation states can be considered as &#8722;1 and +2. These results suggest the considerable potential of tetraboranes as synthons for novel low&#8208;valent boron species.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Photophysical Properties of Aza&#8208;BODIPYs in the Near&#8208;InfraRed Region by Introducing Electron&#8208;Donating Thiophene Substituents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we present the synthesis, the spectroscopic and electrochemical properties of new bis&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted azaboron&#8208;dipyrromethene (aza&#8208;BODIPY) dyes substituting by different electron donating groups connected to the aza&#8208;BODIPY core through a thiophene unit. In line with theoretical calculations, experimental measurements point out the positive impact of the thiophene group that behave as a secondary donor group leading to an enhancement of the intramolecular charge transfer process in comparison to previously reported aza&#8208;BODIPY dyes. This heterocycle has also been found to tune the oxidative potential and to stabilize the electro&#8208;generated species.</dc:description>

         <title>Aggregation Behavior of Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based [3]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The aggregation of a cyclodextrin (CD)&#8208;based [3]rotaxane was observed and analyzed for the first time in detail in this work. Although the hexagonal packing aggregation of CD&#8208;based polyrotaxane is a well known phenomena, corresponding studies in terms of rotaxanes without any polymer structure have not been conducted so far, probably owing to the difficulty of the molecular design. Meanwhile, we synthesized a series of [3]rotaxane species via a urea&#8208;end&#8208;capping method and evaluated their aggregation behavior by XRD and SEM measurements. As a result, [3]rotaxane species containing native CD rings showed clear signals assigned to the hexagonal packing by XRD measurement as well as polyrotaxane, proved their aggregation capability. Since the corresponding per&#8208;acetylated derivatives did not show this aggregation behavior, the driving force of this aggregation was suggested to be hydrogen bond formation among CD units. The effect of axle end structures and partial acetylation of CDs were also studied.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards Fast Circularly Polarized Luminescence in 2&#8208;Coordinate Chiral Mechanochromic Copper(I) Carbene Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of chiral mechanochromic copper(I) cAAC (cAAC = cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene) complexes with a variety of amide ligands have been studied with regard to their photophysical and chiroptical properties to elucidate structure&#8208;property relationships for the design of efficient triplet exciton emitters exhibiting circularly polarized luminescence. Depending on the environment, which determines the excited state energies, either thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) from 1/3LLCT states or phosphorescence from 3LLCT/LC states occurs. However, neither chiral moieties at the carbene nor at the carbazolate ligands provide detectable luminescence dissymmetries glum. An exception is [Cu(phenoxazinyl)(cAAC)], showing orange to deep red TADF with &#955;max = 601&#8208;715 nm in solution, powders and in PMMA. In this case, the amide ligand can undergo distortions in the excited state. This design motif leads to the first linear, non&#8208;aggregated CPL&#8208;active copper(I) complex with glum of &#8208;3.4&#183;10&#8208;3 combined with a high radiative rate constant of 6.7&#183;105 s&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Acidic Properties of Known and New &#8208;COOH Functionalized M(IV) Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report two new &#8208;COOH functionalized MOFs of composition [M6O4(OH)6(PMA)2(H2PMA)] &#183; x H2O, M = Zr, Hf), denoted CAU&#8208;61, synthesized using pyromellitic acid (H4PMA), a tetracarboxylic acid, as the linker and acetic acid as the solvent. The structure was determined from powder X&#8208;ray diffraction data and one dimensional inorganic building units are connected through tetracarboxylate as well as dicarboxylate linker molecules, resulting in highly stable microporous framework structures with limiting and maximum pore diameter of ~3.6 and ~5.0 &#197;, respectively, lined with &#8208;COOH groups. Thermal stabilities of up to 400 &#176;C in air, chemical stability in water at pH 1 to 12 and water uptake of 17 mol/mol prompted us to study the proton exchange of the &#181;2&#8208;OH, &#181;3&#8208;OH of the IBU and &#8208;COOH groups of the linker by titration with LiOH. Comparison of the pKa values with three UiO&#8208;66 derivatives confirms distinct pKa value ranges and trends for the different acidic protons. Furthermore, the preparation of Zr&#8208;CAU&#8208;61 membranes and first results on permeation of dyes and ions in aqueous solutions are presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure Formation in an Ionic Liquid Wetting Layer: A Combined STM, IRAS, DFT and MD Study of [C2C1Im][OTf] on Au(111)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In a solid catalyst with ionic liquid layer (SCILL), ionic liquid (IL) coatings are used to improve the selectivity of noble metal catalysts. To understand the origins of this selectivity control, we performed model studies by surface science methods in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV). We investigated the growth and thermal stability of ultrathin IL films by infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS). We combined these experiments with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to obtain information on the orientation of the ions, the interactions with the surface, the intermolecular interactions, and the structure formation. Additionally, we performed density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to interpret the experimental data.
We studied the IL 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate [C2C1Im][OTf] on Au(111) surfaces. We observe a weakly bound multilayer of [C2C1Im][OTf], which is stable up to 390 K, while the monolayer desorbs at ~450 K. [C2C1Im][OTf] preferentially adsorbs at the step edges and elbows of the herringbone reconstruction of Au(111). The anion adsorbs via the SO3 group with the molecular axis perpendicular to the surface. At low coverage, the [C2C1Im][OTf] crystallizes in a glass&#8208;like 2D phase with short&#8208;range order. At higher coverage, we observe a phase transition to a 6&#8208;membered ring structure with long&#8208;range order.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking the role of guanidinium salts in interface engineering for boosted performance of inverted perovskite solar cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>NiOx&#8208;based inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted growing attention due to their low cost and large&#8208;scale application potential. However, the efficiency and stability of inverted planar heterojunction PSCs is still unsatisfactory owing to insufficient charge&#8208;extraction caused by undesirable interfacial contact between perovskite and NiOx hole transport layers (HTLs). Herein an interfacial passivation strategy with guanidinium salts (guanidinium thiocyanate (GuASCN), guanidine hydrobromide (GuABr), guanidine hydriodate (GuAI)) as passivator is employed to solve this problem. We systematically study the effect of various guanidinium salts on the crystallinity, morphology, and photophysical properties of perovskite films. Guanidine salt as interfacial passivator can decrease interface resistance, reduce carrier non&#8208;radiative recombination, and boost carrier extraction. Notably, the GuABr&#8208;treated unencapsulated devices can still maintain more than 90% of their initial PCE after aging for 1600 hours at 16&#8208;25 &#176;C and 35% &#8208; 50% relative humidity in ambient conditions. This work reveals the significance of counterions in improving the photovoltaic performance and stability of PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>2&#8208;Silylated Dihydroquinazolinone as Photocatalytic Energy Transfer Enabled Radical Hydrosilylation Reagent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hydrosilylation of alkenes is one of the most important methods for the synthesis of organosilicon compounds. In addition to the platinum&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation, silyl radical addition reactions are notable as economic reactions. We have developed an efficient and widely applicable silyl radical addition reaction by using 2&#8208;silylated dihydroquinazolinone derivatives under photocatalytic conditions. Electron&#8208;deficient alkenes and styrene derivatives underwent hydrosilylation to give addition products in good to high yields. Mechanistic studies indicated that the photocatalyst functioned not as a photoredox catalyst but as an energy transfer catalyst. DFT calculations clarified that the triplet excited state of 2&#8208;silylated dihydroquinazolinone derivatives released a silyl radical through the homolytic cleavage of a carbon&#8211;silicon bond, and this was followed by the hydrogen atom transfer pathway, not the redox pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Inept N2 Activation of Tri&#8208;Nuclear Nickel Complex with Labile Sulfur Ligands Facilitates Selective N2H4 Formation in Electrocatalytic Conversion of N2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conversion of N2 to the energy vector N2H4 under benign conditions is highly desirable. However, such N2 fixation processes are extremely rare. It has been recently reported that N2 to N2H4&#160; conversion can be achieved electrochemically by using a trinuclear [Ni3(S2C3H6)4]2&#8208; complex (named as [Ni3S8]2&#8208;). There are hardly any precedents of Nitrogen Reduction Reaction (NRR) by molecular catalysts having Ni and the highly unusual selectivity for N2H4 over NH3 makes this electrochemical reduction unique. A systematic theoretical study employing calibrated Density Functional Techniques to unearth the mechanisms of NRR (4e&#8208;/4H+) and HER (2e&#8208;/2H+) was conducted for the aforementioned trinuclear Ni complex. Our findings unravel a curious case of ligand lability working in tandem with metal centers in facilitating this unprecedented electrocatalytic activity. Furthermore, it is shown that the poor N&#8208;N bond activation property of Ni is responsible for this unusual selectivity. Additionally, the HER mechanistic pathways have also been delineated in this report. The mechanistic intricacies thus unearthed in this study may assist in developing more efficient electrocatalysts for N2H4 production through NRR.</dc:description>

         <title>Improved Luminous Efficiency of AgInS2&#160;Quantum Dots and Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework&#8208;70&#160;Composite for White Light Emitting Diodes Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The application of multiple quantum dots (QDs) in the field of white light emitting diodes (WLEDs) is still an important challenge due to their low luminous efficiency&#160;and quenching phenomenon. In this paper, we prepared AgInS2&#160;QDs/zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;70 (AIS/ZIF&#8208;70) composite by microwave hydrothermal method. Owing to the high porosity and stability of ZIF&#8208;70, it could effectively prevent quenching issues due to the aggregation of QDs. Since the ZIF&#8208;70 and QDs were chemically bonded, the formation of ZnS layer could effectively passivate the surface defect and thus the quantum yield reached 21.49%&#160;in&#160;aqueous solution. The luminous efficiency (LE) of the assembled AIS/ZIF&#8208;based WLED&#160;was reinforced by 6.8 times with molar&#160;ratio of AgIn/Zn=18, i.e. at 5.26% molar fraction of ZIF&#8208;70. Moreover, the color rendering index&#160;(CRI) and correlated color temperature (CCT) of AIS/ZIF&#8208;based WLED were 84.3 and 3631 K, respectively, indicating its potential application in solid&#8208;state lighting.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report here &#8220;sandwich&#8221;&#8208;diimine copper complex&#8208;catalyzed trifluoroethylation and pentafluoropropylation of unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in alkyl esters, halides, and protected amines by employing CF3CHN2 and CF3CF2CHN2 reagents. Reactions proceed in dichloromethane solvent at room temperature. Identical C&#8208;H functionalization conditions and stoichiometries are employed for generality and convenience. Selectivities for C&#8211;H insertions are higher for compounds possessing stronger electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents. Preliminary mechanistic studies point to a mechanism involving a pre&#8208;equilibrium forming a &#8220;sandwich&#8221;&#8208;diimine copper&#8208;CF3CHN2 complex followed by rate&#8208;determining loss of nitrogen affording the reactive copper carbene. It reacts with trifluoromethyldiazomethane about 6.5 times faster than with 1&#8208;fluoroadamantane explaining the need for slow addition of the diazo compound.</dc:description>

         <title>Orthogonal Strategies for Profiling Potential Cellular Targets of Anandamide and Cannabidiol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The human endocannabinoid system regulates a myriad of physiological processes through a complex lipid signaling network involving cannabinoids and their respective receptors, cannabinoid receptor 1 (hCB1R) and cannabinoid receptor 2 (hCB2R). Anandamide (AEA) and cannabidiol (CBD) are classical examples of cannabinoids that elicit a variety of effects, both beneficial and detrimental, through these receptors. Mounting evidence suggested the presence of other potential cannabinoid targets that may be responsible for other observable effects. However, prior pharmacological studies on these cannabinoid compounds provided scant evidence of direct engagement to these proposed targets. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, no chemoproteomics studies nor any protein profiling studies have been demonstrated on CBD. Here we showed that, by taking advantage of the recently developed &#8216;label&#8208;free&#8217; 2D&#8208;TPP (2 Dimensional&#8208;Thermal Protein Profiling) approach, we have identified several new putative targets of both AEA and CBD. Comparison of these interaction landscapes with those obtained from the well&#8208;established affinity&#8208;based protein profiling (AfBPP) platforms led to the discovery of both shared and unique protein targets. Subsequent target validation studies of selected proteins led us to conclude that this 2D&#8208;TPP strategy complements well with the AfBPP approach.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Performance of CsPbIBr2 Perovskite Solar Cell by Modified Zinc Oxide Nanorods Array with [6,6]&#8208;Phenyl C61 Butyric Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[6,6]&#8208;Phenyl C61 butyric acid (PBCA) is introduced to modify ZnO nanorods (ZnO NRs) electron transport layer to reduce surface defects, ameliorate the morphology of perovskite film, enhance charge extraction properties, and improve the photovoltaic performance of CsPbIBr2 perovskite solar cells.







Abstract
Although Metal oxide ZnO is widely used as electron transport layers in all&#8208;inorganic PSCs due to high electron mobility, high transmittance, and simple preparation processing, the surface defects of ZnO suppress the quality of perovskite film and inhibit the solar cells&#8217; performance. In this work, [6,6]&#8208;Phenyl C61 butyric acid (PCBA) modified zinc oxide nanorods (ZnO NRs) is employed as electron transport layer in perovskite solar cells. The resulting perovskite film coated on the zinc oxide nanorods has better crystallinity and uniformity, facilitating charge carrier transportation, reducing recombination losses, and ultimately improving the cells&#8217; performance. The perovskite solar cell with the device configuration of ITO/ZnO nanorods/PCBA/CsPbIBr2/Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD/Au delivers a high short circuit current density of 11.83&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and power conversion efficiency of 12.05&#8201;%.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Hexafluorocyclopentane&#8208;Bridged Bisbutatrienes as Models for Longer Cumulenes: Various Transformations for the Construction of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Frameworks</title>

         <dc:description>
The synthetic utility of longer cumulenes for constructing condensed &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems has received considerable interest. Recently conjugated bisbutatrienes have been evaluated as mimics of a longer cumulene. In this research, the hexafluorocyclopentane&#8208;bridged bisbutatrienes were synthesized. They underwent various cyclizations to construct fulvene, pentalene, germacycle, benzocyclobutene, and cyclooctatetraene frameworks.







Abstract
Cumulenes have attracted considerable attention due to their unique structural and electronic properties. Despite their high potential for constructing condensed &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules, the synthetic utility of longer cumulenes remains to be established owing to their inherently high reactivity. Conjugated bisbutatrienes having two cumulene moieties linked by a spacer as a mimic of a longer cumulene were evaluated. Here, the synthesis and characterization of hexafluorocyclopentane&#8208;bridged bisbutatrienes are described. These bisbutatrienes underwent various cyclizations, to construct the unique &#960;&#8208;extended frameworks inaccessible by other methodologies. The bisbutatrienes were converted into fulvenes, pentalene, germacycle, and benzocyclobutene under various conditions. Furthermore, a cyclooctatetraene derivative was synthesized by a one&#8208;step dimerization of the bisbutatriene.

         <title>Defluorination of Fluorophenols by a Nonheme Iron(IV)&#8208;Oxo Species: Observation of a New Intermediate Along the Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combined experimental and computational study on a biomimetic iron(IV)&#8208;oxo species in reaction with halophenols gives efficient dehalogenation including defluorination in the product. Along the reaction mechanism a novel intermediate is characterized spectroscopically and assigned to be an iron(III)&#8208;hydroxo adduct.







Abstract
High&#8208;valent iron(IV)&#8208;oxo intermediates are versatile oxidants in the biotransformation of various substrates by metalloenzymes and catalyze essential reactions for human health as well as in the biodegradation of toxic organic pollutants in the environment. Herein, we report a biomimetic system that efficiently reacts with halophenols through defluorination reactions and characterize various short&#8208;lived intermediates along the reaction mechanism. We study the reactivity pattern of a nonheme iron(IV)&#8208;oxo species with a series of trihalophenols (X=F, Cl, Br). A combined experimental and computational study reveals that the oxidative dehalogenation of 2,4,6&#8208;trifluorophenol is initiated with an H&#8208;atom abstraction from the phenolic group by the iron(IV)&#8208;oxo species resulting in the formation of a phenolate radical and an iron(III)&#8208;hydroxo species. This iron(III)&#8208;hydroxo species forms an adduct with the oxidized substrate with &#955;max at 558&#8197;nm which subsequently decays to give quinones as products.

         <title>Muscle&#8208;Like Supramolecular Polymers with Dual Motion Patterns</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The motion patterns for traditional muscle&#8208;like supramolecular polymers are confined to unitary direction, much distinct from the natural muscle movement. Herein, we reported a supramolecular polymer possessing with dual motion patterns.







Abstract
Benefiting from the features like polymeric linear structures, stimuli&#8208;responsiveness and dynamic adaptiveness, supramolecular polymers (SPs) are favored as exploiting muscle&#8208;like materials, allowing for imitating the muscle functions. However, a substantial part of these materials barely owned an unitary motion orientation while it was obviously known that muscle movements involved distinct orientations. Herein, M1 holding the structure of 44&#8208;membered macrocycle with two aldehyde groups was designed, meanwhile, M2 comprising of secondary ammonium ions, 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl groups as well as the alkyl chains was fabricated, for which it could be assembled with M1 to generate SPs based on host&#8211;guest interactions from a large macrocycle and two secondary ammonium ions. SPs underwent vertical compression upon the addition of N2H4 owing to the forming dynamic covalent bonds, notably, mechanically interlocked structures were also generated. Afterwards, the vertically compressed SPs experienced horizontal shrinkage when tetrabutylammonium chloride was contributed due to the destruction of host&#8211;guest interactions.

         <title>Mechanism of Acyl Group Migration in Carbohydrates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acyl group migration has been the subject of several studies. Such migration processes may cause problems during synthesis, isolation, and purification of different acyl&#8208;bearing compounds, and have biological relevance, for example, in the metabolism of pharmaceuticals. Considering the recent evidence of acyl group migration being possible even over glycosidic bonds, it could be hypothesized to be involved also in the regulation of biological activity of natural polysaccharides in the host cells. Migrations are mostly observed in carbohydrates, typically having several hydroxyl groups near each other. Several studies have investigated the migration in a single or only a few different carbohydrate molecules, providing different suggestions for the mechanisms of migration, seldom supported by comprehensive computational investigations. In this concept article we discuss the recent progress on the mechanistic aspects of acyl group migration, with carbohydrates in particular focus.</dc:description>

         <title>Autofluorescent Artemisinin&#8208;Benzimidazole Hybrids via&#160;Organo&#8208;Click Reaction: Study of Antiviral Properties and Mode of Action in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Drug modification by a fluorescent label is a common tool for studying its mechanism of action with fluorescence microscopy techniques. However, the attachment of a fluorescent label can significantly alter the polarity, solubility, and biological activity of the investigated drug, and, as a result, the studied mechanism of action can be misrepresented. Therefore, developing efficient drugs, which are inherently fluorescent and can be tracked directly in the cell is highly favorable. Here we present an easy formation of fluorescent hybrid drugs by a combination of two readily available non&#8208;fluorescent pharmacophores via a non&#8208;cleavable linker using a&#160;Ramachary&#8208;Bressy&#8208;Wang&#160;organocatalyzed azide&#8208;carbonyl&#160;[3+2] cycloaddition (organo&#8208;click) reaction.&#160;All newly prepared fluorescent compounds showed strong anti&#8208;HCMV activity (EC50 down to 0.07&#177;0.00 &#181;M), thus presenting a very promising drug developmental basis compared to the approved drug ganciclovir (EC50 2.60&#177;0.50&#160;&#181;M). Remarkably, in vitro fluorescent imaging investigation of new compounds revealed induced changes in mitochondrial structures, which is a phenotypical hallmark of antiviral activity. This approach opens up new vistas for the easy formation of potent fluorescent drugs from readily available non&#8208;fluorescent parent compounds and might facilitate insight into their mode of action in living cells, avoiding the requirement of linkage to external fluorescent markers.</dc:description>

Here we present an easy formation of fluorescent hybrid drugs by a combination of two readily available non-fluorescent pharmacophores via a non-cleavable linker using a&#160;Ramachary-Bressy-Wang&#160;organocatalyzed azide-carbonyl&#160;[3+2] cycloaddition (organo-click) reaction.&#160;All newly prepared fluorescent compounds showed strong anti-HCMV activity (EC50 down to 0.07&#177;0.00 &#181;M), thus presenting a very promising drug developmental basis compared to the approved drug ganciclovir (EC50 2.60&#177;0.50&#160;&#181;M). Remarkably, in vitro fluorescent imaging investigation of new compounds revealed induced changes in mitochondrial structures, which is a phenotypical hallmark of antiviral activity. This approach opens up new vistas for the easy formation of potent fluorescent drugs from readily available non-fluorescent parent compounds and might facilitate insight into their mode of action in living cells, avoiding the requirement of linkage to external fluorescent markers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Boranes: Dual Reagents for the Synthesis of Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have drawn considerable interest in the field of nano&#8208;materials chemistry as highly stabilizing ligands enabling formation of strong and covalent C&#8208;metal bonds. Applied to gold nanoparticles synthesis, the most common strategy consists in the reduction of a preformed NHC&#8208;Au(I) complex with a large excess of a reducing agent rendering the particle size difficult to control. In this paper, we report on the straightforward synthesis of NHC&#8208;coated gold nanoparticles (NHC&#8208;AuNPs) by reacting a commercially&#8208;available gold(I) precursor with an easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize NHC&#8208;BH3&#160;reagent. The latter acts as both the reducing agent and the source of surface ligands operating under mild conditions. Mechanistic studies including NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry demonstrate that the reduction of gold(I) generates NHC&#8208;BH2Cl as a byproduct. This strategy garners efficient control over the nucleation and growth of gold particles by varying the NHC&#8208;borane/gold(I) ratio, allowing unparalleled particle size variation in the range of 4.9 &#177; 0.9 nm to 10.0 &#177; 2.7 nm. Our strategy also allows the unprecedented precise and controlled seeded growth of gold nanoparticles. In addition, the as&#8208;prepared NHC&#8208;AuNPs exhibit narrow size distributions without engaging extensive purification or size selectivity techniques and are stable over months.</dc:description>

         <title>A Light Cleavable Auxiliary for Diselenide&#8208;Selenoester Ligations of Peptides and Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diselenide&#8208;selenoester ligations are increasingly used for the synthesis of proteins. Excellent ligation rates, even at low concentrations, in combination with mild and selective deselenization conditions can overcome some of the most severe challenges in chemical protein synthesis. Here we present the versatile multicomponent synthesis and application of a new ligation auxiliary that combines a photocleavable scaffold with the advantages of selenium&#8208;based ligation strategies. We investigate its use with respect to different ligation junctions and describe a novel para&#8208;methoxybenzyl deprotection reaction for the selenol moiety. The glycine&#8208;based auxiliary enabled successful synthesis of the challenging target protein G&#8208;CSF.</dc:description>

         <title>2,2&#8217;&#8208;Biquinoline&#8208;Based Recyclable Electroauxiliaries for the Generation of Alkyl Radicals via C&#8211;C Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkyl radical precursors are essential for a wide variety of photocatalytic and 3d&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;C bond forming reactions. Neutral organic heterocycles as electroauxiliaries such as 4&#8208;alkyl Hantzsch esters have become reliable tools for alkyl radical formation. Here we show that 2,2&#8217;&#8208;biquinoline&#8208;derived alkyl&#8208;substituted dihydroquinolines act as competent radical precursors with the ability to form primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl radicals. Hydroalkylation of benzalmalononitriles and N&#8208;Boc protected diazenes has been achieved through copper catalysis under mild conditions of 50&#160;&#176;C with good to very good yields of up to 85%. Furthermore, the dihydroquinolines&#8217; reactivity towards a denitrative alkylation of nitroolefins such as &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene was discovered. Most importantly, the released biquinoline can be recycled, which greatly improves the overall atom&#8208;economy of these alkyl radical precursors in comparison to previous N&#8208;heterocyclic electroauxiliaries.</dc:description>

         <title>CH3CN@open&#8208;C60: An Effective Inner&#8208;Space Modification and Isotope Effect inside the Nano&#8208;Sized Flask</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite several small molecules being encapsulated inside cage&#8208;opened fullerene derivatives, such species have not considerably affected the structures and properties of the outer carbon cages. Herein, we achieved an effective inner&#8208;space modification for an open&#8208;cage C60 derivative by insertion of a neutral CH3CN molecule into the cavity. The thus obtained CH3CN@open&#8208;C60 was found to show an enhanced polarity, affording an easy separation from a mixture containing the empty cage by column chromatography on silica gel, without preparative HPLC that was needed for the previous cases. The less negative reduction potentials with respect to those of empty cage reflect the decreased energy level of the LUMO, which is supported by the DFT calculations. It was revealed that both presence of the encapsulated CH3CN and cage deformation caused by the CH3CN play an essential role for the change in the electronic properties, studied by NMR spectroscopy, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis, and theoretical calculations. Furthermore, the favored binding affinity of deuterated acetonitrile CD3CN with internal C60 surface was discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Hantzsch ester as efficient and economical NAD(P)H mimic for in vitro bioredox reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biocatalysis has emerged as a valuable and reliable tool for industrial and academic societies, particularly in bioredox reactions&#8208;related fields. The cost of cofactors, especially those needed to be replenished at stoichiometric amounts or more, is the chief economic concern for bioredox reactions. In this study, a readily accessible, inexpensive, and bench&#8208;stable Hantzsch ester is verified as the viable and efficient NAD(P)H mimic by four enzymatic redox transformations including two non&#8208;heme diiron N&#8208;oxygenases and two flavin&#8208;dependent reductases. This finding provides the potential to significantly reduce the costs of NAD(P)H&#8208;relying bioredox reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;conjugated Bis&#8208;(dithienylethene)&#8208;naphthalenediimide as a Dynamic Anti&#8208;counterfeiting Agent: Driving the Wheel of Photoswitching Enactment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&lt;p&gt;Photochromic fluorescent molecules dramatically extend their fields of applications ranging from optical memories, bioimaging, photoswitches, photonic devices, anti&#8208;counterfeiting technology and many more. Here, we have logically designed and synthesized a triazole appended &lt;a name="_Hlk114846063"&gt;bis&#8208;(dithienylethene&lt;/a&gt;)&#8208;naphthalenediimide based photo&#8208;responsive material, &lt;strong&gt;5&lt;/strong&gt;, which demonstrated fluorescence enhancement property upon photocyclization (F&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.42), with high photocyclization (44 s, k&lt;sub&gt;solution&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.0355 s&lt;sup&gt;&#8208;1&lt;/sup&gt;, k&lt;sub&gt;solid &lt;/sub&gt;= 0.0135 s&lt;sup&gt;&#8208;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and photocycloreversion (160 s, k&lt;sub&gt;solution&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.0181 s&lt;sup&gt;&#8208;1&lt;/sup&gt;, k&lt;sub&gt;solid&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.0085 s&lt;sup&gt;&#8208;1&lt;/sup&gt;) rate and decent photoreaction quantum yield (F&lt;sub&gt;o&amp;rarr;c&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.93 and F&lt;sub&gt;c&amp;rarr;o&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.11). The open isomer almost converted to the closed isomer at photo&#8208;stationary state (&lt;st1:stockticker w:st="on"&gt;PSS&lt;/st1:stockticker&gt;) with distinct color change from colorless to blue with 92.85% conversion yield. A reversible noninvasive modulation of fluorescence through efficient photoinduced electron transfer (PET) process was observed both in solution as well as in solid state. The fluorescence modulation through PET process was further corroborated with thermodynamic calculations using Rehm&#8208;Weller equation and quantum chemical studies (DFT). The thermally stable compound &lt;strong&gt;5 &lt;/strong&gt;exhibits high fatigue resistance property (up to 50 cycles) both in solution and solid state.

Here, we have logically designed and synthesized a triazole appended &amp;lt;a name="_Hlk114846063"&amp;gt;bis-(dithienylethene&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;)-naphthalenediimide based photo-responsive material, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;5&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, which demonstrated fluorescence enhancement property upon photocyclization (F&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;F&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; = 0.42), with high photocyclization (44 s, k&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;solution&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; = 0.0355 s&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-1&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;, k&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;solid &amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;= 0.0135 s&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-1&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;) and photocycloreversion (160 s, k&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;solution&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; = 0.0181 s&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-1&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;, k&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;solid&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; = 0.0085 s&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-1&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;) rate and decent photoreaction quantum yield (F&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;o&amp;rarr;c&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; = 0.93 and F&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;c&amp;rarr;o&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; = 0.11). The open isomer almost converted to the closed isomer at photo-stationary state (&amp;lt;st1:stockticker w:st="on"&amp;gt;PSS&amp;lt;/st1:stockticker&amp;gt;) with distinct color change from colorless to blue with 92.85% conversion yield. A reversible noninvasive modulation of fluorescence through efficient photoinduced electron transfer (PET) process was observed both in solution as well as in solid state. The fluorescence modulation through PET process was further corroborated with thermodynamic calculations using Rehm-Weller equation and quantum chemical studies (DFT). The thermally stable compound &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;5 &amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;exhibits high fatigue resistance property (up to 50 cycles) both in solution and solid state. Furthermore, the compound &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;5 &amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;was successfully applied as erasable ink and in deciphering secret codes (Quick Response/bar code) portending potential promising application in anti-counterfeiting.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>New Generation of Benzidine Wide&#8208;Gap Conjugated Materials: Solution Processing a Classic Evaporated Scaffold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzidine&#8208;type wide&#8208;gap materials are designed in order to access green processing techniques, via functionalization with solubilizing pendant groups. Flexible thin films and organic electronic devices are then prepared from low&#8208;toxic solvent such as alcohols or o&#8208;xylenes.







Abstract
Carbazole&#8208; and fluorene&#8208;substituted benzidine blocks have been functionalized with two different solubilizing pendant groups, in order to enhance the material's solubility in greener solvents. Preserving the optical and electrochemical properties, the aromatic function and substitution showed an important influence on the solvent affinity, achieving concentrations up to 150&#8197;mg/mL in o&#8208;xylenes for the glycol&#8208;containing materials and decent solubility in alcohols for the compounds functionalized with ionic chains. The latter solution proved to be ideal for the preparation of luminescence slot&#8208;die coating film on top of flexible&#8208;substrates up to 33&#8197;cm&#215;2&#8197;cm. As a proof of concept, the materials have been implemented in different organic electronic devices, highlighting the low turn&#8208;on voltage (4&#8197;V) presented by organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), which is comparable with vacuum&#8208;processed devices. A structure&#8208;solubility relationship and a synthetic strategy are disentangled in this manuscript to tailor organic semiconductors and adapt their solubility towards the desired solvent and application.

         <title>A Dormant Reagent Reaction&#8208;Diffusion Method for the Generation of Co&#8208;Fe Prussian Blue Analogue Periodic Precipitate Particle Libraries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For preparation of particle size libraries of products with low solubility constants, a new reaction&#8208;diffusion method is presented through the example of a catalytically valuable Prussian Blue analogue. The particle size analyses of the Liesegang Patterns forming via &#8216;dormant&#8217; citrate complex show the method produces libraries of differently sized products in each band. The new method can be expanded into other PBAs and 2D diffusion systems.







Abstract
Liesegang patterns that develop as a result of reaction&#8208;diffusion can simultaneously form products with slightly different sizes spatially separated in a single medium. We show here a reaction&#8208;diffusion method using a dormant reagent (citrate) for developing Liesegang patterns of cobalt hexacyanoferrate Prussian Blue analog (PBA) particle libraries. This method slows the precipitation reaction and produces different&#8208;sized particles in a gel medium at different locations. The gel&#8208;embedded particles are still catalytically active. Finally, the applicability of the new method to other PBAs and 2D systems is presented. The method proves promising for obtaining similar inorganic framework libraries with catalytic abilities.

         <title>Boosting Methanol&#8208;Mediated CO2 Hydrogenation into Aromatics by Synergistically Tailoring Oxygen Vacancy and Acid Site Properties of Multifunctional Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistically tailoring oxygen vacancy and acid site properties of multifunctional catalyst composed of Cr2O3 and H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 guarantees the superior aromatics synthesis performance of CO2 hydrogenation in a single&#8208;pass. The structure&#8208;function relationship between aromatics synthesis performance and the different catalytic components is well established to boost aromatics synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation.







Abstract
Even though the direct hydrogenation of CO2 into aromatics has been realized via a methanol&#8208;mediated pathway and multifunctional catalyst, few works have been focused on the simultaneously rational design of each component in multifunctional catalyst to improve the performance. Also, the structure&#8208;function relationship between aromatics synthesis performance and the different catalytic components (reducible metal oxide and acidic zeolite) has been rarely investigated. Herein, we increase the oxygen vacancy (Ov) density in reducible Cr2O3 by sequential carbonization and oxidation (SCO) treatments of Cr&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks. Thanks to the enriched Ov, Cr2O3&#8208;based catalyst affords high methanol selectivity of 98.1&#8201;% (without CO) at a CO2 conversion of 16.8&#8201;% under high reaction temperature (350&#8201;&#176;C). Furthermore, after combining with the acidic zeolite H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5, the multifunctional catalyst realizes the direct conversion of CO2 into aromatics with conversion and selectivity as high as 25.4&#8201;% and 80.1&#8201;% (without CO), respectively. The property of acid site in H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5, especially the Al species that located at the intersection of straight and sinusoidal channels, plays a vital role in enhancing the aromatics selectivity, which can be precisely controlled by varying the hydrothermal synthesis conditions. Our work provides a synergistic strategy to boost the aromatics synthesis performance from CO2 hydrogenation.

Thienyl substituents at a diborane(4) provide a mixture of steric flexibility, &#963;&#8208;electron&#8208;withdrawing and mesomeric effects, which enable the stabilization of a highly delocalized diboron radical anion, as well as an increased reactivity towards bond activation and rearrangement reactions upon Lewis&#8208;base coordination and two&#8208;electron reduction.







Abstract
Low&#8208;valent main group chemistry involves a balancing act between steric and electronic stabilization of the electron&#8208;rich low oxidation state main group centers and their desired reactivity. Herein we show that the combination of sterically shielding mesityl and rotationally flexible 2&#8208;thienyl groups, the latter having the potential to be either electronically stabilizing or activating, at a diborane(4) provides a platform for both radical anion stabilization and unusual bond activation and rearrangement reactions. The addition of a Lewis base to a 1,2&#8208;dimesityl&#8208;1,2&#8208;dithienyldiborane(4) (1) results in direct and unprecedented C&#8722;H borylation of one thienyl substituent with cleavage of the B&#8722;B bond. The facile one&#8208;electron reduction of 1 yields a stable diboron radical anion through delocalization of its unpaired electron over the entire planar 1,2&#8208;dithienyldiboron framework, as evidenced by EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. The two&#8208;electron reduction of 1 with magnesium anthracene under more forcing conditions results in B&#8722;B bond cleavage and replacement of one thienyl sulfur atom by a mesitylboron moiety, leading to the formation of a magnesium complex of an &#951;5&#8208;diborafulvene dianion. Salt metathesis of the latter with [(&#951;6&#8208;p&#8208;cymene)RuCl2] affords a mixed ruthenium sandwich complex of an &#951;5&#8208;borylborole dianion. Calculations highlight both the structural and electronic changes in the boron&#8208;substituted heterocyclic C4B dianion upon switching coordination from magnesium (diborafulvene dianion) to ruthenium (borylborole dianion).

         <title>Structural Self&#8208;Assembly and Applications of Metal&#8211;Organic Molecular Containers with Flexible Backbones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic molecular containers (MOMCs), constructed with flexible backbones, exhibit a unique feature both in the structural construction and applications, due to the free rotation and self&#8208;adaptively of the functional groups in the skeletons. This Review focuses on the recent development of flexible MOMCs from the aspects of self&#8208;assembly construction to the various applications, which remains a fertile ground for opportunity and creativity.







Abstract
Supramolecular chemistry has become an interdisciplinary discipline of chemistry, physics, and biology. As a huge subunit of supramolecular compounds, the functional metal&#8211;organic supramolecular systems with well&#8208;defined cavities which are able to accommodate size&#8208;suitable guests via benign host&#8208;guest behavior, have been known as &#8220;metal&#8211;organic molecular containers&#8221; (MOMCs) and attracted much attentions for their rich chemical properties and wide potential applications in molecular recognition, catalysis, bio&#8208;medical and other fields. In particular, the MOMCs with flexible backbones exhibit a unique feature both in the aspect of structural construction and applications, due to the free rotation and self&#8208;adaptively of the specific functional groups in the skeletons. In this paper, we review several selected examples of the coordination&#8208;driven metal&#8211;organic supramolecular systems from the aspects of self&#8208;assembly construction to the various applications. The self&#8208;assembly strategies, especially the different choice of organic ligands with flexible backbones during the construction, leading to quite diverse configurations compared to the rigid ligands, have been also discussed to show a different perspective of metal&#8211;organic system construction.

         <title>Electronic and Charge Transport Properties in Bridged versus Unbridged Nanohoops: Role of the Nanohoop Size</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experimental/theoretical investigations link the size of a nanohoop to its charge transport properties, which are key in organic electronics. the first cyclocarbazole possessing five constituting building units was synthesized and studied. Comparison of the photophysical, electrochemical, morphological and charge transport properties with those of a shorter analogue highlights the key role played by the hoop size. Corresponding cycloparaphenylenes with eight and ten phenyl units were also compared. Notably the saturated field effect mobility of the five&#8208;unit cyclocarbazole is four times higher than that of its smaller analogue.







Abstract
In the field of &#960;&#8208;conjugated nanohoops, the size of the macrocycle has a strong impact on its structural characteristics, which in turn affect its electronic properties. In this work, we report the first experimental investigations linking the size of a nanohoop to its charge transport properties, a key property in organic electronics. We describe the synthesis and study of the first example of a cyclocarbazole possessing five constituting building units, namely [5]&#8208;cyclo&#8208;N&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,7&#8208;carbazole, [5]C&#8208;Bu&#8208;Cbz. By comparison with a shorter analogue, [4]&#8208;cyclo&#8208;N&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,7&#8208;carbazole, [4]C&#8208;Bu&#8208;Cbz, we detail the photophysical, electrochemical, morphological and charge transport properties, highlighting the key role played by the hoop size. In particular, we show that the saturated field effect mobility of [5]C&#8208;Bu&#8208;Cbz is four times higher than that of its smaller analogue [4]C&#8208;Bu&#8208;Cbz (4.22&#215;10&#8722;5 vs 1.04&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1). However, the study of the other organic field&#8208;effect transistor characteristics (threshold voltage VTH and subthreshold slope SS) suggest that a small nanohoop is beneficial for good organization of the molecules in thin films, whereas a large one increases the density of structural defects, and hence of traps for the charge carriers. The present findings are of interest for the further development of nanohoops in electronics.

         <title>18F&#8208;Labeling Chemistry in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct incorporation of 18F into target molecules of interest in aqueous media has many practical advantages. This paper classifies the atoms that form covalent bonds with fluorine and reviews the existing methods for 18F&#8208;labeling in aqueous media. Additionally, some 18F&#8208;labeling mechanisms are explained.







Abstract
18F&#8208;Labeled molecular tracers and subsequent positron emission tomography are indispensable molecular imaging tools in medical diagnosis and research. The preparation of 18F&#8208;labeled molecular tracers involves critical steps such as the 18F&#8208;labeling reaction, work&#8208;up, and 18F&#8208;product purification, which are governed by 18F&#8208;labeling chemistry. Since direct incorporation of 18F in aqueous media exhibits many advantages in practice, this Review summarizes the existing 18F&#8208;labeling methods in aqueous media, which are sorted by atoms forming chemical covalent bonds with F. The Review is focused on the respective reaction mechanism, the water effect and the applications of these methods for the development of 18F&#8208;radiopharmaceuticals. The research progress on aqueous nucleophilic labeling methods using [18F]F&#8722; as the 18F source has been mainly discussed.

         <title>Impact of Faradaic Interlayer Confinement and Carbon&#8208;Centered Macrostructure Designs for Ion Capture and the Recovery of Elements</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the context of desalination and renewable energy, several capacitive deionization processes and variables responsible for ion capture and the recovery of elements are reviewed.







Abstract
Environmental protection associated with renewable energy is among the most critical challenges for translational ion&#8208;capture based on capacitive storage of ions in electrical double layers at the interface of electrode and electrolyte. Electric double&#8208;layer capacitance with charge induction and faradaic pseudo&#8208;capacitance with charge transfer classifies the capacitance of the electrochemical interface. The electrochemical interface in most energy technologies involves porous and pseudocapacitive redox materials that offer varying degrees of electrolyte confinement. In this review, we discuss the factors affecting water desalination, such as the effect of nanopores for ion capture, the ion sieving effect, the effect of hydration energy, and hydration radius in the carbon sub&#8208;nanometer pore. Moreover, the surface phenomena of electrodes, including carbon corrosion, and the potential of zero charge to control the oxidation of carbon electrodes are explained along with protection mechanisms. The various capacitive deionization (CDI) operations and the corresponding electrochemical cell technologies are briefly introduced, including the significance of double&#8208;layer charging materials with faradaic intercalation, which suffer less from co&#8208;ion expulsion. Finally, we revisit the effects of various nanoarchitectures and the construction of capacitive deionization electrodes for clean water technology.

&lt;p&gt;In the context of desalination and renewable energy, several capacitive deionization processes and variables responsible for ion capture and the recovery of elements are reviewed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Environmental protection associated with renewable energy is among the most critical challenges for translational ion-capture based on capacitive storage of ions in electrical double layers at the interface of electrode and electrolyte. Electric double-layer capacitance with charge induction and faradaic pseudo-capacitance with charge transfer classifies the capacitance of the electrochemical interface. The electrochemical interface in most energy technologies involves porous and pseudocapacitive redox materials that offer varying degrees of electrolyte confinement. In this review, we discuss the factors affecting water desalination, such as the effect of nanopores for ion capture, the ion sieving effect, the effect of hydration energy, and hydration radius in the carbon sub-nanometer pore. Moreover, the surface phenomena of electrodes, including carbon corrosion, and the potential of zero charge to control the oxidation of carbon electrodes are explained along with protection mechanisms. The various capacitive deionization (CDI) operations and the corresponding electrochemical cell technologies are briefly introduced, including the significance of double-layer charging materials with faradaic intercalation, which suffer less from co-ion expulsion. Finally, we revisit the effects of various nanoarchitectures and the construction of capacitive deionization electrodes for clean water technology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interaction Modes Between SF4 and Ketones; Study of Intermediates in Deoxofluorination Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acetone and SF4 form two thermally unstable adducts. In the presence of HF and SF4, 2&#8208;adamantanone forms an adduct with a unique O&#8212;(HF)&#8212;S interaction motif that elucidates possible interactions during deoxofluorination of ketones. Based on NPA charges, the C=O&#8212;HF and F3SF&#8212;HF interactions are deemed competitive.







Abstract
Interactions between ketones and SF4 are studied for the simplest ketone, acetone, and the bulky polycyclic 2&#8208;adamantanone. Acetone forms the 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 adduct SF4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;[O=C(CH3)2]2, as well as the dimeric 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 adducts [SF4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;O=C(CH3)2]2 as identified by low&#8208;temperature Raman spectroscopy and, for the latter, X&#8208;ray crystallography. In both adducts, SF4 acts as a double chalcogen&#8208;bond donor to two keto groups. In contrast 2&#8208;adamantanone does not form an isolable solid adduct with SF4; in the presence of HF, however, it forms SF4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;O=C10H14O&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HF, which comprises chains with weak S&#8212;O and S&#8212;FH chalcogen bonds in the crystal structure. Sulfur tetrafluoride in this compound is readily lost at &#8722;85&#8201;&#176;C, leading to the isolation of C10H14O&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HF at low temperature. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations aid in vibrational assignments and serve to describe the interactions of the keto group with SF4 and HF, as well as interactions between SF4 with HF. It is found that separate and combined CO&#8212;HF and CO&#8212;SF4 chalcogen bonds do not polarize the C=O group to any significant degree.

         <title>Intramolecular Hiyama Coupling: Synthesis of 1,8,13&#8208;Trisubstituted Chiral Triptycenes with Three Different Substituents by Intramolecular Substituent Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The proximity of Si&#8722;O&#8722;Pd plays an important role not only in the formation of the oxy&#8208;palladium species in intramolecular Hiyama coupling, but also in the activation of the silyl group to facilitate intramolecular substituent transfer. Various 1,8,13&#8208;trisubstituted chiral triptycenes were synthesized by using this reaction. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Iwata, M. Shindo, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300988).

         <title>Electrospray Ionization Tandem Mass Spectrometry with Collision&#8208;Induced Dissociation of Uranyl Peroxide Nanoclusters Containing Various Uranyl Bridging Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Detecting the presence of uranyl peroxide nanoclusters (UPCs) in solution is difficult, so this study used tandem mass spectrometry with collision&#8208;induced dissociation to probe bridging ions surrounding the uranyl ion and to determine fragmentation fingerprints of UPCs. The image shows an abstract artistic representation of the nanocluster U24Pp12, [(UO2)24(O2)24(P2O7)12]48&#8211;, and its movement through a quadrupole mass analyzer with subsequent fragmentation.

         <title>Amide Skeletal Elongation via Amino Acid Insertion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amide derivatization is useful to access valuable organic compounds considering the ready availability of molecules containing amide functionality. Current approaches to derivatize amide mainly focus on the synthesis of carbonyl&#8208;containing compounds and amines. Incorporating both parts of the initial amide into the new derivatives is rare. Herein, we describe a simple and practical amide derivatization through amino acid insertion to prepare more complex amides. This insertion is applicable to all amino acids and more importantly, the chiral information is completely conserved during the insertion. Comparison of this insertion strategy with conventional amide synthesis demonstrates the synthetic advantages of this new protocol.</dc:description>

         <title>Natural Light&#8208;Regulated Switchable Self&#8208;Adhesive Supramolecular Films for Smart Windows</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Switchable self&#8208;adhesive films are promising coating materials for constructing smart windows. Compared to commonly used hydrogels, self&#8208;adhesive supramolecular films have a variety of advantages and serve as a universal carrier of stimuli&#8208;responsiveness. In this study, supramolecular adhesive is processed into self&#8208;adhesive films, which display tough and long&#8208;stable adhesion to commercially available organic/inorganic glass windows. Spiropyrans are used as the photo&#8208;responsive units to endow smart windows with switchable optical behavior. Reverse photochromism is successfully realized by the combination of supramolecular films and spiropyrans. Reversible and rapid transformations in the color and transmittance of smart windows are fully achieved by natural light irradiation in different weather conditions, including sunny, rainy, and cloudy.</dc:description>

         <title>London Dispersion Effects on the Stability of Heavy Tetrel Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>London dispersion (LD) interactions, which stem from long&#8208;range electron correlations arising from instantaneously induced dipoles can occur between neighboring atoms or molecules, for example, between H atoms within ligand C&#8211;H groups. These interactions are currently of interest as a new method of stabilizing long bonds and species with unusual oxidation states. They can also limit reactivity by installing LD enhanced groups into organic frameworks or ligand substituents. Here, we address the most recent advances in the design of LD enhanced ligands, the sterically counterintuitive structures that can be generated and the consequences that these interactions can have on the structures and reactivity of sterically crowded heavy group 14 species.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigating Design Rules for Photoinduced Electron Transfer Quenching in Triangulenium Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescent probes based on photoinduced electron transfer (PET) quenching of long lifetime triangulenium fluorophores have found multiple applications. For such probes a successful design relies on the right balance between the rates of PET quenching and fluorescence. In a series of ADOTA (A) and DAOTA (D) triangulenium fluorophores appended with aniline&#8208;like quencher moieties, we have investigated the rates of quenching and its relation to thermodynamic driving force, distance, and conjugation within the quencher moiety. Three different quenchers, a short (1), a long (2), and a long twisted (3), 4&#8208;aminophenyl, 4&#8217;&#8208;aminobiphenyl, and 2,2&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4&#8217;&#8208;aminobiphenyl, respectively were investigated. Time&#8208;resolved fluorescence measurement was used to measure PET rate constant&#160;kPET&#160;ranging from &gt;4x1011&#160;s&#8208;1&#160;to 2x109&#160;s&#8208;1. Interestingly, PET quenching is equally efficient/fast from&#160;1&#160;and&#160;2, even with increase in distance between the donor and the acceptor. However, when twisting the biphenyl in&#160;3, a 20&#8208;fold decrease in quenching is found. Even with the decrease in&#160;kPET&#160;the quenching in&#160;3A/D&#160;is still highly efficient, with nearly 99% quenching. The study show that long lifetime fluorophores can be efficiently switched even by relative slow PET processes and that PET quencher moieties can be removed far from the fluorophore if conjugated linkers are applied.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The first case of successful suppression of the coordination of a lithium atom with a dialkylamino group by the effective conjugation of the latter with the aromatic core has been discovered. This effect controls regioselectivity of the bromine&#8208;lithium exchange in 4,6,7,9&#8208;tetrabromo&#8208;1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;perimidine, which leads to products with the most effective conjugation. As a result, the product of this quadruple exchange demonstrates no tendency of the coordination of the NMe groups to neighboring lithium atoms despite the absence of steric restrictions. Experimental results are explained by means of quantum chemical calculations: geometry optimization, natural bond analysis and scans using the modredundant scheme.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalysis by KDM6 Histone Demethylases &#8211; A Synergy between the Non&#8208;Heme Iron(II) Center, Second Coordination Sphere, and Long&#8208;Range Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>KDM6A (UTX) and KDM6B (JMJD3) are human non&#8208;heme Fe(II) and 2&#8208;oxoglutarate (2OG) dependent JmjC oxygenases that catalyze the demethylation of trimethylated lysine 27 in the N&#8208;terminal tail of histone H3, a post&#8208;translational modification that regulates transcription. We performed Combined Quantum Mechanics/ Molecular Mechanics and Molecular Dynamics study on the catalytic mechanism of KDM6A/B.&#160;The results reveal that the transition state for the rate&#8208;limiting hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reaction in KDM6A/B catalysis is stabilized by polar (Asn217) and aromatic (Trp369)/non&#8208;polar (Pro274) residues in contrast to KDM4 and KDM7 demethylases where charged residues (Glu, Arg, Asp) are involved.&#160;KDM6A employs both &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;electron transfer pathways for HAT, whereas KDM6B employs the &#963;&#8208;electron pathway. Differences in hydrogen bonding of the Fe&#8208;chelating Glu252(KDM6B) contribute to the lower energy barriers in KDM6B vs. KDM6A.&#160;The study reveals a dependence of the activation barrier of the rebound hydroxylation on the Fe&#8208;O&#8208;C angle in the transition state of KDM6A. Anti&#8208;correlation of the Zn&#8208;binding domain with the active site residues is a key factor distinguishing KDM6A/B from KDM7/4s.

We performed Combined Quantum Mechanics/ Molecular Mechanics and Molecular Dynamics study on the catalytic mechanism of KDM6A/B.&#160;The results reveal that the transition state for the rate-limiting hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reaction in KDM6A/B catalysis is stabilized by polar (Asn217) and aromatic (Trp369)/non-polar (Pro274) residues in contrast to KDM4 and KDM7 demethylases where charged residues (Glu, Arg, Asp) are involved.&#160;KDM6A employs both &#963;- and &#960;-electron transfer pathways for HAT, whereas KDM6B employs the &#963;-electron pathway. Differences in hydrogen bonding of the Fe-chelating Glu252(KDM6B) contribute to the lower energy barriers in KDM6B vs. KDM6A.&#160;The study reveals a dependence of the activation barrier of the rebound hydroxylation on the Fe-O-C angle in the transition state of KDM6A. Anti-correlation of the Zn-binding domain with the active site residues is a key factor distinguishing KDM6A/B from KDM7/4s. The results reveal the importance of communication between the Fe center, second coordination sphere, and long-range interactions in catalysis by KDMs and, by implication, other 2OG oxygenases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage, Stereoretentive, and Site&#8208;Selective Modification of Synthetic Peptides by Using Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoredox&#8208;catalysed reaction of activated thioethers unveils alanyl radical intermediates in a stereoretentive and site&#8208;selective manner. Installation of the activating group is simple, and the intermediate radical can react with non&#8208;activated alkenes to form non&#8208;natural residues bearing aliphatic, hydrophobic units. The method is applicable to late&#8208;stage peptide functionalisation and expands the scope of analogues that can be accessed.







Abstract
Late&#8208;stage functionalisation is an attractive method to generate peptide analogues containing non&#8208;natural residues. It is shown that cysteine residues can be activated as Crich&#8208;type thioethers, either by alkylation of a synthetic cysteine&#8208;continuing peptide or by incorporation of a modified cysteine unit into solid phase or solution phase peptide synthesis. Photoredox catalysed reaction of the thioether generates an alanyl radical intermediate in a stereoretentive and site&#8208;selective manner, even in the presence of free cysteine residues. The radical can react with non&#8208;activated alkenes to form non&#8208;natural residues bearing aliphatic, hydrophobic units. A method to avoid unwanted alkylation of amine residues was identified and the process was applied to the functionalization of both linear and cyclic synthetic peptides.

         <title>[Ni(CO)4]+ as NiI Synthon: Synthesis and Characterization of NiI Half&#8208;Sandwich and Sandwich Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 19&#8201;valence electron, half&#8208;sandwich cations [Ni(arene)(CO)2]+ (arene=C6H6, C6H4F2) and the homoleptic [Ni(C6H4F2)2]+ were synthesized endergonically from [Ni(CO)4]+[F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; (RF=C(CF3)3) by irreversible removal of CO from the equilibrium. This procedure is likely transferable to any kind of weak ligand. The [Ni(C6H4F2)2]+ cation revealed an unprecedented &#951;3,&#951;3&#8208;slipped sandwich structure which probably is the ultimate NiI source.







Abstract
The stable, easily accessible salt [Ni(CO)4]+[F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; (RF=C(CF3)3) was used as a NiI synthon to generate the novel half&#8208;sandwich complexes [Ni(arene)(CO)2]+ (arene=C6H6, o&#8208;dfb=1,2&#8208;F2C6H4). By irreversible removal of CO from the equilibrium, even the rather endergonic reaction to a [Ni(o&#8208;dfb)2]+ salt was successful (&#916;rG&#176;(solv)=+78&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). The latter displays an unprecedented slipped &#951;3,&#951;3&#8208;sandwich structure and is the ultimate synthon to NiI&#8208;chemistry.

         <title>Secondary Amine&#8208;Mediated Domino Reaction for the Synthesis of Substituted Quinolines from Dicyanoalkenes and Enynals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;substituted quinoline derivatives were synthesized from dicyanoalkenes and unsaturated aldehydes via an organocatalyst&#8208;mediated domino reaction in excellent yields. Two catalytic system were established including diphenylprolinol silyl ether and di(2&#8208;ethyl)hexylamine. As catalyst is the amine and a by&#8208;product is only water, this is an environmentally benign reaction.







Abstract
Substituted quinolines, tricyclic and tetracyclic molecules with a quinoline moiety are synthesized by a domino reaction from dicyanoalkenes and 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;pent&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;4&#8208;ynals in one pot. We established two methods: one is catalyzed by chiral diphenylprolinol silyl ether, and the other is catalyzed by di(2&#8208;ethyl)hexylamine, in combination with p&#8208;nitrophenol. A wide variety of dicyanoalkenes can be employed. As the catalysts are secondary amines, and water is the only by&#8208;product, this is an environmentally benign synthetic method for the preparation of substituted quinolines.

         <title>High Rates of Quinone&#8208;Alkyne Cycloaddition Reactions are Dictated by Entropic Factors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Second&#8208;order rate constants for the SPOCQ click reaction between an ortho&#8208;quinone and various strained systems are accurately determined. Thermodynamic activation parameters of the click reaction with two strained alkynes were determined using Eyring plots, and show that the reaction is controlled by entropic factors.







Abstract
Reaction rates of strained cycloalkynes and cycloalkenes with 1,2&#8208;quinone were quantified by stopped flow UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy and computational analysis. We found that the strained alkyne BCN&#8722;OH 3 (k2 1824&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) reacts &gt;150&#8197;times faster than the strained alkene TCO&#8208;OH 5 (k2 11.56&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1), and that derivatization with a carbamate can lead to a reduction of the rate constant with almost half. Also, the 8&#8208;membered strained alkyne BCN&#8722;OH 3 reacts 16&#8197;times faster than the more strained 7&#8208;membered THS 2 (k2 110.6&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1). Using the linearized Eyring equation we determined the thermodynamic activation parameters of these two strained alkynes, revealing that the SPOCQ reaction of quinone 1 with THS 2 is associated with &#916;H&#8800; of 0.80&#8197;kcal/mol, &#916;S&#8800;=&#8722;46.8 cal/K&#8901;mol, and &#916;G&#8800;=14.8&#8197;kcal/mol (at 25&#8201;&#176;C), whereas the same reaction with BCN&#8722;OH 3 is associated with, &#916;H&#8800;=2.25&#8197;kcal/mol, &#916;S&#8800;=&#8722;36.3 cal/K&#8901;mol, and &#916;G&#8800;=13.1&#8197;kcal/mol (at 25&#8201;&#176;C). Computational analysis supported the values obtained by the stopped&#8208;flow measurements, with calculated &#916;G&#8800; of 15.6&#8197;kcal/mol (in H2O) for the SPOCQ reaction with THS 2, and with &#916;G&#8800; of 14.7&#8197;kcal/mol (in H2O) for the SPOCQ reaction with BCN&#8722;OH 3. With these empirically determined thermodynamic parameters, we set an important step towards a more fundamental understanding of this set of rapid click reactions.

Using the linearized Eyring equation we determined the thermodynamic activation parameters of these two strained alkynes, revealing that the SPOCQ reaction of quinone &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; with THS &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; is associated with &#916;&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8800;&lt;/sup&gt; of 0.80&#8197;kcal/mol, &#916;&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8800;&lt;/sup&gt;=&#8722;46.8 cal/K&#8901;mol, and &#916;&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8800;&lt;/sup&gt;=14.8&#8197;kcal/mol (at 25&#8201;&#176;C), whereas the same reaction with BCN&#8722;OH &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; is associated with, &#916;&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8800;&lt;/sup&gt;=2.25&#8197;kcal/mol, &#916;&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8800;&lt;/sup&gt;=&#8722;36.3 cal/K&#8901;mol, and &#916;&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8800;&lt;/sup&gt;=13.1&#8197;kcal/mol (at 25&#8201;&#176;C). Computational analysis supported the values obtained by the stopped-flow measurements, with calculated &#916;&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8800;&lt;/sup&gt; of 15.6&#8197;kcal/mol (in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) for the SPOCQ reaction with THS &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, and with &#916;&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8800;&lt;/sup&gt; of 14.7&#8197;kcal/mol (in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) for the SPOCQ reaction with BCN&#8722;OH &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;. With these empirically determined thermodynamic parameters, we set an important step towards a more fundamental understanding of this set of rapid click reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>De&#8208;Novo Design of pre&#8208;miR&#8208;21 Maturation Inhibitors: Synthesis and Activity Assessment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A RNA&#8208;focused library targeted against the production of the oncogenic microRNA&#8208;21 was designed and synthesized according to a five&#8208;step sustainable approach. Low&#8208;micromolar affinities towards pre&#8208;miR&#8208;2, good selectivity against other nucleic acid structures and promising inhibition activity (in the two&#8208;digit micromolar range) in Dicer processing of the pre&#8208;miR&#8208;21 were determined for a trifluoromethyl&#8208;functionalized derivative.







Abstract
Targeting RNA with small molecules is a major challenge of current medicinal chemistry, and the identification and design of original scaffolds able to selectively interact with an RNA target remains difficult. Various approaches have been developed based on classical medicinal chemistry strategies (fragment&#8208;based drug design, dynamic combinatorial chemistry, HTS or DNA&#8208;encoded libraries) as well as on advanced structural biology and biochemistry methodologies (such as X&#8208;ray, cryo&#8208;EM, NMR, or SHAPE). Here, we report the de novo design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of RNA ligands by using a straightforward and sustainable chemistry combined with molecular docking and biochemical and biophysical studies that allowed us to identify a novel pharmacophore for RNA binding. Specifically, we focused on targeting the biogenesis of microRNA&#8208;21, the well&#8208;known oncogene. This led us not only to promising inhibitors but also to a better understanding of the interactions between the small&#8208;molecule compounds and the RNA target paving the way for the rational design of efficient inhibitors with potential anticancer activity.

         <title>HAV&#8208;Peptides Attached to Colloidal Probes Faithfully Detect E&#8208;Cadherins Displayed on Living Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With a minimum of chemistry, we developed a tool based on functionalized colloidal probes that mimic the presence of adjacent cells detecting the presence of E&#8208;cadherins on the cell surface. The specificity and dynamic strength of the peptide&#8208;E&#8208;cadherin interaction can be read out demonstrating the potential for a label&#8208;free screening of cell surfaces.







Abstract
Cell adhesion molecules are crucial for a variety of biological processes, including wound healing, barrier formation and tissue homeostasis. One of them is E&#8208;cadherin which is generally found at adherent junctions between epithelial cells. To identify this molecule on the surface of cells, E&#8208;cadherin mimetic peptides with a critical amino acid sequence of HAV (histidine&#8208;alanine&#8208;valine) were synthesized and attached to solid&#8208;supported membranes covering colloidal probes. Two different functionalization strategies were established, one based on the complexation of DOGS&#8208;NTA(Ni) with a polyhistidine&#8208;tagged HAV&#8208;peptide and the other one relying on the formation of a HAV&#8208;lipopeptide using in&#8197;situ maleimide&#8208;thiol coupling. Binding studies were performed to verify the ability of the peptides to attach to the membrane surface. Compared to the non&#8208;covalent attachment via the His&#8208;tag, we achieved a higher yield by lipopeptide formation. Colloidal probes functionalized with HAV&#8208;peptides were employed to measure the presence of E&#8208;cadherins on living cells either using video particle tracking or force spectroscopy. Here, human HaCaT cells were examined confirming the specific interaction of the HAV&#8208;peptide with the E&#8208;cadherin of the cells. Statistical methods were also used to determine the number of single&#8208;bond ruptures and the force of a single bond. These findings may be essential for the development of novel biosynthetic materials given their potential to become increasingly relevant in medical applications.

         <title>Intermolecular Triazene Alkene Cycloaddition via Lewis Base Catalysis: Access to Diverse Trifluoromethylated Pyrazolines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient Lewis base catalytic transformation to functionalized 3&#8208; and 5&#8208;trifluoromethylpyrazolines is developed via [3+2] triazene&#8208;alkene cycloaddition reactions of an array of unactivated alkenes with CF3CHN2. This approach features good functional group tolerance and mild reaction conditions. Synthetic utility of the procedure is elucidated by structure diversification of known pharmaceuticals, natural products, and bioactive molecules.







Abstract
A novel approach to chemoselective synthesis of biologically important CF3&#8208;subsituted pyrazolines was developed via a Lewis base catalyzed intermolecular triazene cycloaddition reaction of an array of terminal/internal alkenes with CF3CHN2. This strategy features a catalytic amount of 1,8&#8208;diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;ene, high yields (up to 95&#8201;%), wide substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance (54 examples). Importantly, we preformed scaffold diversification of a panel of known pharmaceuticals, natural products, and bioactive heterocycles to generate the corresponding pyrazoline derivatives with potential broad bioactivities for further development.

The sponge&#8208;derived, highly unsaturated marine macrolide (&#8722;)&#8208;zampanolide is a potent antimitotic agent and cancer cell growth inhibitor. By using a convergent synthetic approach, the shown series of partially reduced and/or demethylated analogs were obtained. Depending on the site of modification, these compounds show a range of microtubule&#8208;binding affinities and cellular activities, thus providing new insights into the relative importance of specific double bonds and methyl groups for biological activity.

         <title>Antitumor Activity and Reductive Stress by Platinum(II) N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes based on Guanosine
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Platinum(II) complexes bearing NHCs based on guanosine undergo a substantial increase in antiproliferative activity when changing the ligand trans to the NHC from bromide to hydride. Compound 6 leads to an increase in reductive stress and increase in glutathione levels in cancer cells but not in non&#8208;cancer cells.







Abstract
Platinum(II) complexes bearing N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes based guanosine and caffeine have been synthesized by unassisted C&#8722;H oxidative addition, leading to the corresponding trans&#8208;hydride complexes. Platinum guanosine derivatives bearing triflate as counterion or bromide instead of hydride as co&#8208;ligand were also synthesized to facilitate correlation between structure and activity. The hydride compounds show high antiproliferative activity against all cell lines (TC&#8208;71, MV&#8208;4&#8208;11, U&#8208;937 and A&#8208;172). Methyl Guanosine complex 3, bearing a hydride ligand, is up to 30&#8197;times more active than compound 4, with a bromide in the same position. Changing the counterion has no significant effect in antiproliferative activity. Increasing bulkiness at N7, with an isopropyl group (compound 6), allows to maintain the antiproliferative activity while decreasing toxicity for non&#8208;cancer cells. Compound 6 leads to an increase in endoplasmic reticulum and autophagy markers on TC71 and MV&#8208;4&#8208;11 cancer cells, induces reductive stress and increases glutathione levels in cancer cells but not in non&#8208;cancer cell line HEK&#8208;293.

         <title>Trinuclear PdII Complexes with a C3&#8208;Symmetric Triethynylbenzene&#8208;Based Tris&#8208;NHC Ligand: Catalytic Benefits</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic benefits: Trinuclear PdII complexes with an extended C3&#8208;symmetric triethynylbenzene&#8208;based tris&#8208;NHC ligand are presented. Catalytic studies indicate an enhanced activity of the trinuclear PdII complex in comparison to the corresponding mononuclear PdII complex. An electronic effect in the trinuclear ligand platform is likely to be responsible for the better catalytic activity of the trinuclear complexes over mononuclear complexes.







Abstract
A new C3&#8208;symmetric tris&#8208;imidazolium tribromide salt 3, featuring 1,3,5&#8208;substituted triethynylbenzene, was used for the preparation of a trinuclear PdII pyridine&#8208;enhanced precatalyst preparation stabilization and initiation&#8208;type (PEPPSI) complex by triple C2 deprotonation followed by the addition of PdCl2. Trinuclear PdII complex possessing a combination of NHC and PPh3 ligands has also been synthesized. The corresponding mononuclear palladium(II) complexes have also been synthesized for the comparison purpose. All these complexes have been characterized by using NMR spectroscopy and ESI mass spectrometry. The molecular structure of the trinuclear palladium(II) complex bearing mixed carbene and pyridine donor ligands has been established by using single crystal XRD. All the palladium(II) complexes have been used as pre&#8208;catalysts, which gave good to excellent yields in intermolecular &#945;&#8208;arylation of 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxindole and Sonogashira coupling reaction. Catalytic studies indicate an enhanced activity of the trinuclear PdII complex in comparison to the corresponding mononuclear PdII complex for both catalytic transformations. The better performance of the trinuclear complex has also been further supported by preliminary electrochemical measurements. A negative mercury poison test was observed for both the aforementioned catalyses and therefore, it is likely that these organic transformations proceed homogeneously.

         <title>Phosphate&#8208;functionalized Zirconium Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Enhancing Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Battery Cycling</title>

Functional framework: A phosphate&#8208;functionalized metal&#8211;organic framework improves charge transport and enhances sulfur utilization as sulfur cathode additive for lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.







Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage devices due to their outstanding theoretical energy density. However, they suffer from low sulfur utilization and poor cyclability, greatly limiting their practical implementation. Herein, we adopted a phosphate&#8208;functionalized zirconium metal&#8211;organic framework (Zr&#8208;MOF) as a sulfur host. With their porous structure, remarkable electrochemical stability, and synthetic versatility, Zr&#8208;MOFs present great potential in preventing soluble polysulfides from leaching. Phosphate groups were introduced to the framework post&#8208;synthetically since they have shown a strong affinity towards lithium polysulfides and an ability to facilitate Li ion transport. The successful incorporation of phosphate in MOF&#8208;808 was demonstrated by a series of techniques including infrared spectroscopy, solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray pair distribution function analysis. When employed in batteries, phosphate&#8208;functionalized Zr&#8208;MOF (MOF&#8208;808&#8208;PO4) exhibits significantly enhanced sulfur utilization and ion diffusion compared to the parent framework, leading to higher capacity and rate capability. The improved capacity retention and inhibited self&#8208;discharge rate also demonstrate effective polysulfide encapsulation utilizing MOF&#8208;808&#8208;PO4. Furthermore, we explored their potential towards high&#8208;density batteries by examining the cycling performance at various sulfur loadings. Our approach to correlate structure with function using hybrid inorganic&#8211;organic materials offers new chemical design strategies for advancing battery materials.

         <dc:description>
Pt(II)&#8722;NHC complexes are used in alkene hydrosilylation reactions. Some of the examined compounds display excellent catalytic activity, outperforming Pt(0)&#8722;NHC pre&#8208;catalysts. Our study explores the catalyst structure&#8208;activity relationship and provides new mechanistic insights into this industrially important transformation. A sustainable protocol, featuring efficient platinum removal, allows us to access a series of organosilanes in very good to excellent yields.







Abstract
Herein, we report the catalytic activity of a series of platinum(II) pre&#8208;catalysts, bearing N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands, in the alkene hydrosilylation reaction. Their structural and electronic properties are fully investigated using X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). Next, our study presents a structure&#8208;activity relationship within this group of pre&#8208;catalysts and gives mechanistic insights into the catalyst activation step. An exceptional catalytic performance of one of the complexes is observed, reaching a turnover number (TON) of 970 000 and a turnover frequency (TOF) of 40 417&#8197;h&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;ppm catalyst loading. Finally, an attractive solvent&#8208;free and open&#8208;to&#8208;air alkene hydrosilylation protocol, featuring efficient platinum removal (reduction of residual Pt from 582&#8197;ppm to 5.8&#8197;ppm), is disclosed.
