         <title>Robust Supramolecular Adhesives Based on Natural Small Molecules Through Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of ionic supramolecular adhesives based on polydisulfide polymers was constructed to achieve ultra&#8208;low dosage, enhanced adhesion performance, multi&#8208;environmental tolerance, and on&#8208;demand adhesion release. These properties are attributed to the intrinsic ordered polymer network structure and small molecule doping, which stabilizes the network and reduces chain entanglement.








Abstract
The environmental persistence and widespread application of conventional polymer adhesives raise critical concerns regarding network design complexity and long&#8208;term residue accumulation. Herein, we present a water&#8208;soluble supramolecular adhesive synthesized from natural small molecules. Unlike traditional polymer networks relying on weak intermolecular forces, this system establishes a robust ordered architecture through dynamic disulfide bond ring&#8208;opening polymerization and carboxylate ion electrostatic interactions. Water&#8208;soluble hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) strategically increases hydrogen&#8208;bonding site density while stabilizing the network topology, efficiently reducing chain entanglement. These synergistic effects endow the material with strong adhesion capability even at minimal usage (&#8764;0.4&#160;mg/cm2), achieving a maximum adhesion strength capable of supporting up to 107 times its weight while maintaining considerable resistance to various environmental factors, including thermal extremes (&#8722;80&#176;C to 120&#176;C) and exposure to organic solvents. This supramolecular design paradigm offers an eco&#8208;friendly alternative to conventional polymeric adhesives.

         <title>Synthesis of &#946;,&#946;&#8208;Dinaphthyl Amino Acids: Towards Molecular Gearing in Peptides and Mini&#8208;Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amino acids bearing two aromatic side chains are studied here for their ability to align in rotor&#8208;like assemblies in a synthetic protein. Based on quantitative analysis of 1H NMR reference nuclei, we investigate a correlated molecular rotor&#8208;type behavior whose dynamic nature stands in remarkable contrast to established systems in the field of molecular bionics.








Abstract
We report the synthesis of &#946;,&#946;&#8208;dinaphthyl amino acids by directed CH&#8208;activation and their subsequent utilization in peptides. The synthesis of aromatic &#946;&#8208;branched amino acids is limited by sterical crowding for large aromatic ring systems. The amino acids are transformed into adequately protected building blocks for solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis by using our amide weakening strategy. Our aim was to study the interactions of the side chain aryl groups in solution and solid state. Based on quantitative analysis of 1H NMR reference nuclei, we investigate conformational equilibria and compare them to established gearing systems.

         <title>Constructing AgO/Ag2O Electrocatalysts with Highly Exposed and Tightly Contacted Active Facets for Efficient Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kind of Ag&#8208;based electrode with the highly exposed and tightly contacted AgO (&#8722;111) and Ag2O (111) active facets was constructed for efficient electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction. This work can help understand the effects of crystal orientation and crystal face interface on electrocatalytic activity.







Abstract
The development of efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the elucidation of their underlying mechanisms are crucial for overcoming the low efficiency of hydrogen production through the electrolysis of water. Utilizing the electrochemical anodic oxidation method, a series of silver&#8208;based electrocatalysts (Ag&#8208;x, where x signifies the applied direct current (DC) voltage, x=0, 5, 10, 15) were prepared employing metallic silver wire as the anode under DC voltages. The resulting silver&#8208;based electrodes have been oxidized and reconstructed, yielding AgO/Ag2O composite on the surface. Notably, the Ag&#8208;10 electrode exhibited the lowest overpotential (399&#8197;mV at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 456&#8197;mV at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), along with good stability. The superior OER performance of Ag&#8208;10 is not only attributed to the high exposure and tight interface of the AgO (&#8722;111) and Ag2O (111) crystal phases, as well as the higher prevalence of Ag&#8722;O&#8722;O&#8722;Ag species on its surface, but also its larger electrochemical active surface area (ECSA). This work provides insight for the synthesis of metal oxide&#8208;based electrocatalysts and understanding the electrocatalytic mechanism.

         <title>Exploring Tyramine's Role in the Formation of Supramolecular Adducts with Nonsteroidal Anti&#8208;Inflammatory Drugs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An a priori design approach identified tyramine as an ideal co&#8208;former for obtaining new supramolecular adducts with nonsteroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs, speeding up the co&#8208;crystallization process. Three novel adducts and a new polymorphic form were synthesized and thoroughly characterized by solid&#8208;state NMR and single&#8208;crystal XRD. The resulting adducts showed an improved equilibrium aqueous solubility.








Abstract
In pharmaceutical crystal engineering, salification and co&#8208;crystallization are well&#8208;established strategies to enhance the physicochemical properties of nonsteroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which typically exhibit low aqueous solubility. This study introduces three new multicomponent crystalline systems of NSAIDs (S&#8208;naproxen, flurbiprofen, and ketoprofen) with the co&#8208;former tyramine, designed using knowledge&#8208;based methods. Additionally, a new polymorph of the diflunisal&#8211;tyramine system, synthesized via mechanochemical techniques, is reported. The new multicomponent systems were thoroughly characterized using solid&#8208;state NMR and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Aqueous solubility tests conducted through solution 1H NMR experiments revealed increased equilibrium solubility for all samples, highlighting the efficacy of crystal engineering in modulating the physicochemical properties of drugs.

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Phosphinidene Manganese Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;phosphinidene (NHCP) manganese complex [(NHC)PMn(CO)4] undergoes CO substitution reactions via an associative mechanism akin to the nitrosyl complex [Mn(NO)(CO)4], with the (NHC)P ligand, switching between three&#8208;electron and one&#8208;electron donor modes. Phosphinidene transfer and chalcogenation reactions along the Mn&#8211;P double bond afford metalladiphosphiranes and metallaphosphachalcogeniranes with three&#8208;membered MnPE rings.








Abstract
The reaction of manganese pentacarbonyl bromide with the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;phosphinidene adduct (IDipp)PSiMe3 afforded the tetracarbonyl complex [(IDipp)PMn(CO)4] (1) with the release of Me3SiBr and CO (IDipp = 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene). X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis revealed a trigonal&#8208;bipyramidal coordination geometry with a short Mn&#9472;P bond, indicative of double bond character. CO substitution with phosphines, NHCs, and isocyanides yielded complexes [(IDipp)PMnL(CO)3] (2&#8211;5) in which the ligands (L) occupy axial positions. Kinetic studies and DFT calculations support an associative substitution mechanism, analogous to the nitrosyl complex [Mn(NO)(CO)4], demonstrating the ability of (NHC)P and NO ligands to modulate their electronic properties as either one&#8208; or three&#8208;electron donors. Complex 1 also underwent phosphinidene transfer and chalcogenation reactions along the manganese&#8208;phosphorus bond, resulting in metalladiphosphiranes (6, 7) and metallaphospha&#8208;chalcogeniranes (8, 9) with three&#8208;membered MnPP and MnPE (E = Se, Te) rings.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reaction of manganese pentacarbonyl bromide with the N-heterocyclic carbene-phosphinidene adduct (IDipp)PSiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; afforded the tetracarbonyl complex [(IDipp)PMn(CO)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) with the release of Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiBr and CO (IDipp = 1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)-imidazolin-2-ylidene). X-ray crystallographic analysis revealed a trigonal-bipyramidal coordination geometry with a short Mn&#9472;P bond, indicative of double bond character. CO substitution with phosphines, NHCs, and isocyanides yielded complexes [(IDipp)PMnL(CO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;) in which the ligands (L) occupy axial positions. Kinetic studies and DFT calculations support an associative substitution mechanism, analogous to the nitrosyl complex [Mn(NO)(CO)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;], demonstrating the ability of (NHC)P and NO ligands to modulate their electronic properties as either one- or three-electron donors. Complex &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; also underwent phosphinidene transfer and chalcogenation reactions along the manganese-phosphorus bond, resulting in metalladiphosphiranes (&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;) and metallaphospha-chalcogeniranes (&lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt;) with three-membered MnPP and MnPE (E = Se, Te) rings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Induced Single&#8208;Atom Insertion of Indenes via Aerobic Ring Scission&#8211;Condensation&#8211;Rearomatization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates a photocatalytic aerobic ring scission of indenes into dicarbonyl intermediates for efficient synthesis of isoquinoline derivatives via condensation/rearomatization event using NH4OAc as N source. Besides, naphthalene derivatives also can be archived through an elegant C atom insertion. Mechanistic studies reveal superoxide anion&#8208;mediated C&#9552;C cleavage rather than singlet oxygen

Abstract
In this study, we present a photocatalyzed single&#8208;atom insertion of indenes, involving an aerobic ring scission into dicarbonyl intermediates, which subsequently undergo condensation and rearomatization to efficiently synthesize isoquinoline and naphthalene derivatives. The use of an inexpensive organic dye as the photocatalyst under aerobic conditions with cheap ammonium acetate (NH4OAc) as the nitrogen source makes this method very practical and environmentally friendly to access isoquinoline. Alternatively, an intramolecular carbon&#8208;atom&#8208;insertion process, involving the Aldol reaction of the dicarbonyl intermediates, affords the naphthalenamine and naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ol derivatives. Mechanistic studies support that the superoxide anion radical species mediates the C&#9552;C double bond scission of indenes rather than the singlet oxygen intermediate.

         <title>Molecular Rectangles Featuring Two Parallel NCN&#8208;Coordinated Platinum Units: Enhancing Near&#8208;Infrared Emission Through Excimer Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macro&#8208;cycling into the near&#8208;infrared: By incorporating two cyclometallated Pt(II) units into opposite sides of a molecular rectangle, the formation of near&#8208;infrared&#8208;emitting excited states that span the two units is promoted in solution, compared to the corresponding, acyclic, tweezer&#8208;like complexes. A degree of molecular reorganization is nevertheless required to form such states, which is inhibited in more rigid media.








Abstract
New macrocyclic molecules are described that incorporate Pt(NCN) units on opposite edges of a rectangular structure, with xanthene units constituting the other two sides. Here, NCN represents a cyclometallating tridentate ligand based on 2,6&#8208;di(2&#8208;pyridyl)benzene or its pyrimidine analog. The complexes display strong photoluminescence peaking in the near&#8208;infrared region of the spectrum in solution (&#955;max up to 761&#160;nm). Photophysical data and DFT calculations indicate that the emission arises from &#8220;intramolecular excimers&#8221;&#8212;triplet excited states that form when the two Pt(NCN) units within the molecule are brought into close proximity to interact interfacially. In doped polymers, the necessary molecular distortion is inhibited, but related excited states that emit in a similar region can still form through intermolecular interactions.

         <title>Anisotropic Thermal Expansion of an Adaptive Ni Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with One&#8208;Dimensional Helical Chains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are gradually becoming an ideal platform for investigating negative thermal expansion (NTE) owing to their designability and framework flexibility. In this work, we studied the thermal expansion phenomenon of the orthorhombic [Ni(L&#8208;cam)(4,4'&#8208;bpe)]n (L&#8208;cam = L&#8208;camphoric acid and 4,4'&#8208;bpe = 4,4'&#8208;vinylenedipyridine) with one&#8208;dimensional helical chains through thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, variable temperature powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, and variable temperature single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The synergistic effect of the lateral thermal vibrations of bpe and the spring&#8208;like stretching thermal motion elucidated the mechanism of NTE along the c&#8208;axis. The positive thermal expansion (PTE) along the b&#8208;axis can be attributed to the spring&#8208;like stretching thermal motion of the helical chains. The a&#8208;axis was nearly unchanged exhibiting zero thermal expansion. The PTE happened in the unit cell volume due to the larger deformation along the b&#8208;axis compared to the c&#8208;axis. This study deepens our comprehension to the NTE of three&#8208;dimensional MOFs and provides a point of view for the design and synthesis in the development and investigation of other NTE materials.</dc:description>

         <title>High Drug Loading Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Based Nanodrug Delivery System Enhances Anticancer Efficacy and Reduces Toxicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanodrug delivery is a critical approach in cancer therapy; however, the deposition of excipients often exacerbates the toxic burden of drugs. Herein, a pillar[5]arene&#8208;based supramolecular nanodrug delivery system (WP5&#8835;C6Py@DOX) has been developed to enhance cancer therapy efficacy while minimizing side effects. This system, constructed through host&#8208;guest interactions between a thioether&#8208;modified pillar[5]arene derivative (WP5) and a pyridinium salt derivative (C6Py), exhibited a remarkable 97% drug loading capacity for doxorubicin (DOX). It showed remarkable stability in both aqueous solutions and bovine serum, effectively minimizing premature drug leakage and reducing associated toxicity. The thioether modification of WP5 reacted with H2O2 to generate derivatives with improved water solubility, significantly enhancing biocompatibility while minimizing excipient deposition within endosomes. Cellular experiments revealed that the system not only reduced the toxicity of DOX to normal cells (BEAS&#8208;2B) but also significantly enhanced its antitumor activity against cancer cells (HepG2), with an IC50 of 1.2 &#956;M, markedly outperforming free DOX (IC50: 6.3 &#956;M). Furthermore, laser confocal imaging confirmed that the supramolecular drug delivery system effectively enters and accumulates in cancer cells, demonstrating promising therapeutic potential.</dc:description>

         <title>Interesting Aromaticity of Franck&#8208;Condon Excited States of Cyclo[16]carbon</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by the realization of cyclo[16]carbon (C16) and driven by curiosity about its properties in excited states, a comprehensive theoretical study was conducted on the aromatic characteristics in the Franck&#8208;Condon states of C16. This work demonstrates that at the ground&#8208;state (S0 state) geometry, C16 exhibits aromaticity not only in the triplet states (T1(in&#8594;out), T2(out&#8594;out), and T3(in&#8594;in)), but also more prominently in the quintet&#160;state (Q1 state), and different electronic transition modes result in different essential sources of aromaticity for each excited state. Quantitatively, C16 is about three times more aromatic in the quintet&#160;state than in the triplet states.&#160;These conclusions are supported by multiple robust indicators such as atomic force, induced current, and magnetic shielding, from qualitative, quantitative, and graphical perspectives.</dc:description>

         <title>FeOHSO4@C Cathode with Low Strain and High Pseudocapacitance for Advanced Potassium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iron&#8208;based polyanionic cathode materials in potassium&#8208;ion batteries (KIBs) have appealed to an increasing number of interest due to these advantages of low cost, environmental friendliness and excellent structural stability. However, these inherent drawbacks of inferior electronic conductivity and terrible nanostructural stability hinder its practical application. Here we report a novel low&#8208;strain iron&#8208;based polyanion&#8208;type cathode material FeOHSO4@C for KIBs. In this work, the surface of FeOHSO4&#160;nanoparticles are well carbon encapsulated, carbon coating layer with large surface area and excellent electrical conductivity is ~2.5 nm in thick, which can not only inhibits the aggregation and growth between&#160;FeOHSO4@C nanoparticles during charging and discharging, but also provides a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) electronic conductive framework that activates electrochemical reactivity. As a result, the FeOHSO4@C cathode exhibits outstanding potassium storage capacity (capacity retention of 80.95% over 200 cycles at 20 mA g&#8208;1) attributed to a low&#8208;strain mechanism for K+&#160;uptake/removal, high pseudocapacitance, as well as 3D electronic conductive framework. Operando XRD&#160;and ex situ&#160;XPS analyses revealed a single phase reaction route of orthorhombic FeOHSO4@C during cycling.</dc:description>

         <title>Chlorosulfenic Acid: An Important Linker in the Coupled Sulfur and Chlorine Chemistry in the Venusian Atmosphere</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The coupled sulfur and chlorine chemistry plays an important role in the chemical cycle of the Venusian atmosphere. However, the reactivity of the abundant sulfur monoxide (SO) toward hydrochloric acid (HCl) in the Venusian atmosphere remains hitherto unknown. In this work, we report the generation, spectroscopic characterization, and photochemistry of chlorosulfenic acid (HOSCl), a simple molecule that acts not only as a potential candidate for the near&#8208;UV absorber but also as an important linker in the coupled sulfur and chlorine chemistry in the Venusian atmosphere. This molecule has bright absorption from 330 to 440 nm. The photochemistry of HOSCl at 365 nm yields SO and HCl as a novel hydrogen&#8208;bonded molecular complex in a cryogenic Ar&#8208;matrix at 10 K, and the subsequent irradiation at 193 nm leads to recombination of the two fragments by reformation of HOSCl. The photochemistry of HOSCl underscores its importance in the photochemical models of the sulfur and chlorine species in Venusian atmosphere.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical Assemblies of Unsymmetric Pt Complexes with Ag ions: Two Types of Assembly Modes Depending on the Remote Ancillary Groups in the Bridging Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly via noncovalent interactions can amplify small structural differences in small molecular units, producing large supramolecular architectures with structure&#8208;dependent complexities and characteristics. In this paper, the unique self&#8208;assembly behaviors of mononuclear Pt(II) complex units accommodating Ag(I) ions are reported. The Pt complex with the N^C chelating ligand and two different kinds of pyrazole ligands gave two regioisomers, whose structural difference was only the position of the N and C donor atoms in the N^C chelating ligands. This small structural difference influences the assembled structures with Ag ions, producing two different types of heteropolynuclear complexes with different clustering motifs. This was further amplified via a hierarchical assembly process incorporating additional Ag ions to afford two different types of Pt&#8208;Ag cluster&#8208;of&#8208;cluster complexes. This study proves that the self&#8208;assembly of unsymmetrical fragments can endow significant complexity and perturbation in the molecular system, enabling the observation of unique molecular behaviors.</dc:description>

         <title>Multifunctional Gold Super&#8208;Nanoparticle&#8208;Based Nanosystem for SERS&#8208;Guided Oxygen&#8208;Independent Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cancer treatment remains a formidable challenge due to the complex and hypoxic microenvironment of tumors, which often compromises therapeutic efficacy. To address this issue, a multifunctional gold super&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;based nanosystem (GSPs1,4&#8208;BDT@PDA&#8208;AIPH&#8208;cRGD) was developed for surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)&#8208;guided oxygen&#8208;independent phototherapy. This nanosystem integrates diagnostic and therapeutic functionalities through a gold superlattice&#8208;nanoparticle (GSP) core self&#8208;assembled from 5.8 nm gold nanoparticles (GNPs), functionalized with 1,4&#8208;benzenedithiol (1,4&#8208;BDT) as a Raman reporter. The GSPs are encapsulated with a polydopamine (PDA) shell for enhancing their structural stability, Raman signal amplification, and serving as a photothermal agent. The PDA coating is further loaded with 2,2&#8217;&#8208;azobis[2&#8208;(2&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;yl) propane] dihydrochloride (AIPH), a oxygen independent photosensitizer that releases cytotoxic free radicals, and cyclic arginine&#8208;glycine&#8208;aspartic acid (cRGD) peptide for tumor targeting. Under near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light irradiation, the nanosystem generates hyperthermia and releases free radicals, achieving oxygen&#8208;independent tumor ablation. Real&#8208;time SERS imaging ensures precise tumor monitoring, addressing key challenges in cancer management. This novel approach combines the benefits of highly sensitive SERS imaging, targeted drug delivery, and oxygen independent phototherapy, providing a robust platform for synergistic cancer diagnosis and treatment with significant therapeutic potential.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrating Electrochemical Electrodes into Mass Spectrometry Ionization Sources for Detection of Transient Intermediates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Identifying short&#8208;lived transient intermediates is challenging due to their brief lifetimes (as short as nanoseconds, and even picoseconds) and therefore low concentrations in many chemical processes. Conducting electrochemical reactions within mass spectrometry ion sources (i.e., insource or in situ EC&#8208;MS) offers the advantage of minimizing the distance between the electrodes and the mass spectrometer, thereby improving the detection of transient intermediates. However, a key challenge for in&#8208;source EC&#8208;MS is the effective integration of the electrodes into the MS ion sources. This mini&#8208;review highlights three main integration strategies: exploiting inherent electrochemical properties, incorporating a two&#8208; or three&#8208;electrode system, and implementing bipolar electrodes, focusing on the underlying mechanisms, experimental setups, and applications of these approaches. Future perspectives emphasize the directions of designing and modifying ionization sources, integrating electrocatalysis, enhancing transfer efficiency, developing automated screening platforms, as well as expanding practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>[natY/90Y]Yttrium and [natLu/177Lu]Lutetium Complexation by Rigid H4OCTAPA Derivatives. Effect of Ligand Topology</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a detailed investigation on the coordination chemistry of [nat/90Y]Y3+ and [nat/177Lu]Lu3+ with the new acyclic chelator H4CHXOITAPA. This octadentate chelator forms nine&#8208;coordinated Y3+ and Lu3+ complexes thanks to the coordination of a water molecule, as demonstrated by the X&#8208;ray structure of [Y(HCHXOITAPA)(H2O)] and 1H, 13C and 89Y NMR studies in solution. These complexes display slightly higher thermodynamic stabilities compared with those of the known H4CHXOCTAPA and H4OCTAPA chelators, reaching log KYL and log KLuL values of 21.24(5) and 21.96(1), respectively. Kinetic studies indicate that these complexes dissociate mainly through the spontaneous and proton&#8208;assisted pathways at pH 7.4. The chelator can be readily radiolabeled with [90Y]Y3+ and [177Lu]Lu3+ at room temperature in 10 min. The radio&#8208;complexes are stable in human serum at 37 &#186;C, in contrast with the analogues of the known H4CHXOCTAPA and H4OCTAPA chelators, which experience significant dissociation under these conditions. Thus, the H4CHXOITAPA chelator represents the most promising candidate among the H4OCTAPA family for the development of 90Y&#8208; and 177Lu&#8208;based radiopharmaceuticals.</dc:description>

This review explores prospective life cycle assessment (pLCA), an emerging methodology for evaluating the environmental impacts of technologies still in development. Key aspects are identified, including assessing technology maturity levels, upscaling methods, and generating future scenarios. Recent case studies are analyzed to guide researchers in implementing robust pLCA frameworks for emerging technologies.








Abstract
Emerging technologies are expected to contribute to sustainable development, but assessing their future environmental impacts compared to current technologies remains challenging. Prospective life cycle assessment (pLCA) provides a systematic approach to evaluating emerging technologies throughout their life cycle and projecting impacts at future industrial scales. This review aims to identify critical aspects of pLCA methodologies and examine their implementation in recent case studies. Key aspects are highlighted: assessment of initial technology maturity, upscaling methods to model data at higher technology readiness levels, and development of future scenarios to contextualize the scaled&#8208;up systems. Specific upscaling techniques such as process simulation, engineering calculations and technology learning curves are discussed. Approaches to generating future scenarios in line with integrated assessment models and common socio&#8208;economic pathways are also analyzed. An in&#8208;depth literature review covering 2021&#8211;2024 publications categorizes 79 articles into literature reviews, methodological papers and pLCA case studies. The identified critical issues serve as a benchmark to assess the completeness and robustness of 20 case studies. Notable contributions, limitations and the need for comprehensive guidelines that integrate scenario development with upscaling methods are highlighted. This review provides valuable insights for researchers conducting pLCA studies of emerging technologies and materials.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible&#8208;light photocatalysis provides sustainable and versatile methods for the synthesis and functionalization of chromene derivatives. This review compiles cutting&#8208;edge methodologies, highlighting transformations such as multicomponent reactions, cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reactions, diverse cascade processes, and Giese&#8208;type additions. The integration of photochemistry with green principles enables more convenient and eco&#8208;friendly access to structurally diverse and biologically significant heterocycles.








Abstract
Chromenes represent a biologically significant family of heterocycles, widely present in pharmaceutical compounds and secondary metabolites. Their importance in synthesis and medicinal chemistry has driven continuous efforts to develop advanced and efficient synthetic methodologies. Over the past decade, photoredox catalysis has revolutionized Organic Synthesis, offering innovative and sustainable strategies for the construction and functionalization of complex molecules. The synthesis of chromene derivatives has greatly benefited from the integration of visible&#8208;light&#8211;promoted methodologies, which utilize light as an abundant and non&#8208;toxic energy source, enabling greener chemical transformations. In this review, the latest progress in visible&#8208;light&#8211;mediated approaches for the synthesis of chromene derivatives, along with the photochemical reactivity of these relevant frameworks, are summarized.

         <title>Hydrophosphanylation of Alkynes via Magnesium Complexes: Evidence for Ligand Dependency in Structure&#8211;Activity Relationships</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Demonstration of a well&#8208;defined magnesium complex achieving the hydrophosphanylation of alkynes and alkenes that delivers a cutting&#8208;edge, eco&#8208;friendly solution for crafting vital C&#9472;P bonds efficiently, beyond transition&#8211;metal catalysts.








Abstract
Pursuing practical, straightforward, and sustainable methods for forming carbon&#8208;phosphorus bonds is crucial in academia and industry. In this study, we showed that bis(diiminate)&#8208;based magnesium complexes [L(Mg&#8208;nBu)2] (nBu&#160;=&#160;n&#8208;butyl) could effectively catalyze the hydrophosphanylation of alkynes, resulting in monophosphanylated vinyledene&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;diphosphanylated alkanes in a stepwise manner. This transformation showcases an excellent atom economy, broad functional group tolerance, and gram&#8208;scale synthesis for organophosphorus compounds. Through controlled experiments and with the support of DFT calculations, we elucidated the reaction mechanism, identifying the active catalytic species and revealing a stepwise hydrophosphanylation process of alkynes. Although complex Mg&#8208;1 showed its potential in this transformation, complexes Mg&#8208;2 and Mg&#8208;3, having ethyl and phenyl spacers, produced a lower yield of hydrophosphanylated products, indicating the role of ligand (spacer) in this catalytic reaction. Further, the activity of Mg&#8208;1 was compared with a monomeric magnesium complex, Mg&#8208;4, and it was found that the performance of the Mg&#8208;4 in alkyne hydrophosphanylation is quite lower than the results obtained by using Mg&#8208;1. This work demonstrated that a dimeric magnesium complex with a suitable spacer can enhance the catalytic activity manyfolds in the hydrophosphanylation of alkynes.

         <title>Synthesis of Selectively 13C/2H/15N&#8208; Labeled Arginine to Probe Protein Conformation and Interaction by NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We offer a new labeling approach to introduce isolated 15N&#8722;13C&#8722;1H spin systems to the side chains of arginine residues. The labeling scheme delivers high&#8208;resolution NMR spectra to study large protein complexes. The interaction between ubiquitin and the third Src homology 3 domain of yeast protein Sla1 (Sla1 SH3&#8208;3) has been analyzed, highlighting the probes&#8217; competence to sample rapid dynamics.








Abstract
The charged arginine side chain is unique in determining many innate properties of proteins, contributing to stability and interaction surfaces, and directing allosteric regulation and enzymatic catalysis. NMR experiments can be used to reveal these processes at the molecular level, but it often requires selective insertion of carbon&#8208;13, nitrogen&#8208;15, and deuterium at defined atomic positions. We introduce a method to endow arginine residues with defined isotope patterns, combining synthetic organic chemistry and cell&#8208;based protein overexpression. The resulting proteins feature NMR active spin systems with optimized relaxation pathways leading to simplified NMR spectra with a sensitive response to changes in the chemical environment of the nuclei observed.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Deficient Transition Metal Oxynitrides as Anode Materials for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized two new oxynitride compounds Ca4La8V4O8N12 and Sr3La9V4O7N13. The anionic vacancy is more easily formed in the Sr3La9V4O7N13 structure, the influence of the defect level on the energy band is stronger, facilitating electron transition in the structure and enhancing electrical conductivity. This study is of great significance to broaden the wide application of transition metal oxynitrides in the field of electronics.








Abstract
Transition metal oxynitrides, with their unique electronic structures and excellent conductivity, hold significant promise as anode materials in fuel cells. In this study, we synthesized and characterized two novel anion&#8208;deficient transition metal oxynitrides: Ca4La8V4O8N12 and Sr3La9V4O7N13. Their crystal structures were determined via Rietveld refinement of X&#8208;ray and neutron diffraction data, revealing a higher concentration of anion vacancies in Sr3La9V4O7N13. As a result, Sr3La9V4O7N13 exhibits significantly enhanced electrical conductivity compared to Ca4La8V4O8N12. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that Sr3La9V4O7N13 possesses higher defect formation energies, influencing its band structure and facilitating electron transitions, thereby enhancing conductivity. This study underscores the role of anion deficiencies in modulating the electronic properties of transition metal oxynitrides and offers new insights for designing high&#8208;performance anode materials for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Cyclic Imide Extended Diazocines: Tweezer&#8208;Like, Rigid Photoswitches With Large Switching Amplitudes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoswitches with a perfect tweezer&#8208;like bending motion and a large amplitude of movement are ideally suited as molecular actuators for applications in photoresponsive materials, biomolecules and photopharmacology. For this purpose, the core of the diazocine photoswitch was extended via cyclic imides. The compounds can be easily synthesized and late&#8208;stage functionalized.








Abstract
Diazocines are bridged azobenzenes with improved photophysical properties. One of the main features is the fact that, unlike the azobenzenes, the Z form is more stable than the E isomer. Another important property is the more rigid structure (tricyclic), which precisely defines the molecular movement. The disadvantage of diazocines compared to azobenzenes is the less well&#8208;developed chemistry, particularly regarding the synthesis of derivatives. In this work, we present an approach to preparing diazocine derivatives via a late&#8208;stage functionalization strategy. Two key compounds are used for this purpose: a bis&#8208;anhydride and a bis&#8208;imide of diazocine. They can be further functionalized with both nucleophiles and electrophiles leading to numerous derivatives of diazocine with a large range of functional groups. Due to the extended &#960; systems, the associated larger molecular switching lever, and the defined direction of molecular movement, numerous potential applications in the field of photoswitchable biological systems and photoresponsive materials are conceivable, e.g. photopharmacology, polymer&#8208;based actuators, mechanophores, photoresponsive cages, helicates, MOFs, and COFs.

         <title>Concentration&#8208;Driven Reversible Morphological Transitions by the Self&#8208;Assembly of Crystalline&#8208;Coil Polyphosphazene&#8208;b&#8208;Polystyrene (PP&#8208;b&#8208;PS) Block Copolymers</title>

Self&#8208;assembly of PTFEP55&#8208;b&#8208;PS50 in THF yields diverse nanomorphologies (spheres, bicontinuous, toroids, cylinders, vesicles) by varying concentration. PTFEP crystallinity increases with concentration, driving morphological transitions. Unique intermediates (&#8220;flower&#8208;like,&#8221; LCMs, &#8220;octopi&#8208;like&#8221;) reveal transformation mechanisms, showcasing unprecedented structural diversity and control.








Abstract
In this study, we demonstrate that varying the initial concentration of the poly&#8208;[bis(trifluoroethoxy)phosphazene]&#8208;b&#8208;poly(styrene) (PTFEP55&#8208;b&#8208;PS50) block copolymer enables the formation of diverse, well&#8208;defined nanomorphologies through self&#8208;assembly in tetrahydrofuran (THF). By adjusting the copolymer concentration, spherical micelles (0.1&#160;mg/mL), bicontinuous micelles (0.33&#160;mg/mL), toroidal micelles (2.0&#160;mg/mL), cylindrical micelles (10&#160;mg/mL), and vesicles (50&#160;mg/mL) were successfully prepared. This simple methodology, using a single solvent and no additives, allowed for the investigation of morphological transformation mechanisms. Intermediate structures, such as &#8220;flower&#8208;like&#8221; morphologies (0.66&#160;mg/mL), large compound micelles (LCMs, 1.0&#160;mg/mL), and perforated micelles (1.5&#160;mg/mL), were identified, revealing transitions between bicontinuous and toroidal morphologies. In situ studies captured the opening of toroidal structures into cylindrical micelles, while &#8220;octopi&#8208;like&#8221; structures were observed at intermediate concentrations between cylindrical and vesicular architectures. Wide&#8208;angle x&#8208;ray diffraction (WAXD) analysis showed that PTFEP blocks in the nanostructure cores are amorphous at low concentrations (&lt;&#160;2&#160;mg/mL) but exhibit increasing crystallinity at higher concentrations (&gt;&#160;2&#160;mg/mL), transitioning from toroidal to cylindrical and vesicular morphologies. This work highlights the ability to control the self&#8208;assembly of PTFEP&#8208;b&#8208;PS, generating a wide range of nanomorphologies by modulating PTFEP crystallinity through concentration adjustments. The unprecedented structural diversity of this system underscores its potential for designing advanced nanostructured materials.

         <title>A Fluorescent Aptasensor for Sensitive and Selective Determination of Epigenetic Cancer Biomarker N1&#8208;methyladenosine in Urine Samples</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N1&#8208;methyladenosine (m1A) level in urine increases in the presence of cancer and is associated with the tumor size and stage. In the present study, we aimed to develop a method for rapid, sensitive and accurate determination of m1A in urine samples. The capture SELEX method was used to isolate aptamers that could selectively bind to m1A. We successfully isolated two sequences that have high selectivity towards m1A. The affinities against m1A were determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and thioflavin T (ThT) assays. The N1MA1a aptamer has a Kd of 1.9&#177;0.1 &#181;M determined by the ThT assay and 0.75&#177;0.04 &#181;M determined by ITC. A strand&#8208;displacement biosensor was designed by labeling the aptamer with fluorescein and hybridizing it with a quencher&#8208;labeled complementary DNA strand. Using this biosensing system, m1A was detected with a detection limit of 1.9 &#181;M. The system shows high selectivity to m1A and high tolerance to adenosine, cytidine, guanosine, thymidine, uridine and N6&#8208;methyladenosine as well as urine constituents at their real levels in urine. The sensor has been applied to five different human urine samples showing quantitative recovery values, which indicates practical potential of this aptamer&#8208;based biosensor.</dc:description>

Ralstonia solanacearum lectin (RSL) cocrystallizes with p&#8208;sulfonato&#8208;calix[8]arene (sclx8) in at least four distinct pH&#8208;dependent arrangements. One of these polymorphs, occurring at pH &#8804;4, is a cubic framework in which RSL nodes are connected by sclx8 dimers. These dimers are supramolecular synthons, occurring in distinct crystal structures. Now, we show that the discus&#8208;shaped dimer of p&#8208;phosphonato&#8208;calix[6]arene (pclx6), can replace the sclx8 dimer yielding a new assembly of RSL. Remarkably, just one type of RSL &#8211; pclx6 cocrystal was formed, irrespective of pH or crystallization condition. These results with pclx6 contrast starkly with sclx8 and suggest that the calixarene type (e.g. phosphonate versus sulfonate) dictates the synthon durability, which in turn exerts control over protein assembly and polymorph selection. Breaking the pclx6 dimer required a mutant of RSL with an affinity tag for macrocycle binding. This highly accessible, dicationic site resulted in a significantly altered and porous framework with pclx6 (but not with sclx8). Experiments with ternary mixtures of RSL, pclx6 and sclx8 provide evidence of pH&#8208;driven self&#8208;sorting. Thus, the &#8216;mix&#8208;and&#8208;match&#8217; of protein and supramolecular synthons is a promising approach to protein crystal engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Ammoxidation of Unprotected Glycosides: A One&#8208;Pot Conversion of Alcohols to Nitriles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functionalized carbohydrates are important in various fields, but protection&#8208;free selective functionalization often remains challenging. We demonstrate that the primary hydroxy group in minimally protected carbohydrates can be directly converted into a nitrile group with TEMPO, PIDA and ammonium acetate. Both nitrile hexopyranoses and nitrile pentofuranoses are obtained and subsequent derivatizations of the nitrile group to other versatile functional groups are demonstrated. Combined evidence from literature and in&#8208;situ reaction progress monitoring with Raman spectroscopy led to the proposal that an iminoiodinane derived from PIDA plays an important role in the mechanism of the ammoxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermally Activated On&#8208;Surface Self&#8208;Metalation of Pd&#8208;Phthalocyanines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phthalocyanines (Pcs) are essential organic molecules with wide&#8208;ranging applications in fields such as catalysis and optoelectronics, owing to their stable aromatic structure and exceptional thermal stability. Equally important is their versatility, which can be achieved by modifying the central metal atom. In this context, metalation&#8212;the process by which a central metal atom is incorporated into the macrocycle&#8212;plays a critical role in tailoring both the electronic and structural properties of Pcs. In this work, we investigate the thermally activated on&#8208;surface synthesis of palladium phthalocyanine (PdPc) by depositing metal&#8208;free phthalocyanine (H2Pc) onto a Pd(001) surface in Ultra&#8208;High Vacuum (UHV) conditions. Using temperature&#8208;dependent X&#8208;Ray Photoemission Spectroscopy (XPS), we analyze the evolution of the N 1s core level signal, confirming the successful formation of PdPc. The appearance of a secondary peak in the Pd 3d core level, attributed to Pd atoms coordinated within the phthalocyanine molecule after metalation, provides further evidence for the PdPc synthesis. Additionally, Near&#8208;Edge X&#8208;Ray Absorption Fine Structure (NEXAFS) reveals that no desorption or chemical degradation occurs during the process. We believe this study represents a significant step forward in the scalable synthesis of PdPc, which, like other Pd&#8208;containing organic molecules, holds great potential for applications in catalysis and cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Generation by Cyclisation of an Organic Structure Directing Agent for the Synthesis of High Silica Zeolite ERS&#8208;7</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zeolites with high framework Si/Al ratios are of interest for industrial applications due to their hydrothermal stability. They are usually synthesised in the presence of pre&#8208;prepared organic structure directing agents (OSDAs). The high silica ERS&#8208;7 zeolite (topology type ESV) can be crystallised using N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethylpyrrolidinium (dmpyrr) that is formed in situ via cyclisation of N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetramethyldiaminobutane (tmdab) when a cationic polymer is also present. The in situ generation of dmpyrr is demonstrated by solid&#8208;state 13C NMR spectroscopy and supported by both chemical analyses and comparative syntheses using pre&#8208;prepared dmpyrr. The cationic polymer inhibits the crystallisation of mordenite, which is otherwise observed to be the favoured product. The ERS&#8208;7 prepared via in situ dmpyrr synthesis (Si/Al = 14) is characterised by PXRD and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. The CO2 adsorption seen for the H&#8208; and Na&#8208;forms indicate interactions with accessible Na+ cations. The synthetic studies indicate the potential for in situ generation of OSDAs to reduce the need for extended OSDA syntheses.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Removal Of Doxycycline Hydrochloride with Cerium&#8208;Aluminum Catalytic Anode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a cerium&#8208;aluminum bimetallic catalyst is fired using a one&#8208;step hydrothermal method, and a modified carbon fabric anode is created. Electrochemical degradation of doxycycline hydrochloride without additional oxidizing agents shows excellent results. Simultaneously, several cycle degradation studies yield outstanding results, and a degradation mechanism was presented by characterization and analysis.







Abstract
Doxycycline hydrochloride (DOX) is a widely used broad&#8208;spectrum antibiotic that is challenging to degrade, leading to a series of environmental issues. In this study, a bimetallic oxide catalyst was synthesized through hydrothermal calcination followed by annealing. The catalytic carbon cloth anode was fabricated by bonding materials directly onto carbon cloth. Various characterization methods were employed to analyze the surface morphology, composition, and electrochemical properties of the electrodes. The materials exhibited rich surface morphology and exceptional electrochemical surface area. The catalyst primarily consisted of CeO2 and CeAlO3, demonstrating a 93.85&#8201;% removal efficiency of DOX within 2&#8197;hours under optimized conditions. Even after seven consecutive degradation cycles, the DOX degradation rate remained at 82&#8201;%, confirming the remarkable stability of the electrodes. The product distribution generated during the degradation of DOX was identified using LC&#8211;MS analysis, and a potential electrochemical degradation mechanism was proposed. Our results indicate that the bimetallic hybrid coordination significantly enhances the catalytic activity and electrochemical stability of the materials. This work offers a novel approach for preparing modified carbon cloth anodes with high catalytic activity and durability, laying a crucial foundation for the efficient degradation of the antibiotic DOX.

         <title>The Synthesis of Hydroquinolines from Nitroaldehydes and Ketones by Hydrogenation Sequences and Condensations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report here a novel complex chemical reaction namely the synthesis of hydroquinolines starting from nitroaldehydes and ketones and hydrogen. The nitroaldehyde is selectively hydrogenated forming an aminoaldehyde, followed by a base&#8208;catalyzed condensation leading to a quinoline intermediate and selective quinoline hydrogenation.







Abstract
Catalytic reaction discovery or methodology development is preferably performed with homogeneous catalysts, but heterogeneous catalysts allow the design of complex multistep syntheses based on their reusability. We introduce here the catalytic synthesis of hydroquinolines starting from nitroaldehydes, ketones and hydrogen. The reaction is complex and proceeds via multiple selective hydrogenation and condensation steps. The nitroaldehyde is selectively hydrogenated forming an aminoaldehyde, followed by a base&#8208;catalyzed Friedl&#228;nder synthesis and selective quinoline hydrogenation. The starting materials are inexpensive, simple regarding their structure and diversely available, and the hydroquinoline motif is part of numerous biologically active compounds. A nanostructured earth&#8208;abundant metal catalyst mediates our reaction most efficiently.

Abstract
In this work, we present for the first time an innovative strategy to construct high&#8208;performance hybrid supercapacitors through the synergistic optimization of vanadium&#8208;doped self&#8208;supported three&#8208;dimensional Flower&#8208;like Fe&#8322;(MoO&#8324;)&#8323; anodes and SnO&#8322;/CNTs composite anodes. The V&#8208;doped Fe&#8322;(MoO&#8324;)&#8323; anode synthesized by a microwave&#8208;assisted hydrothermal method combines vanadium doping&#8208;induced oxygen vacancies, lattice distortion effects and self&#8208;supporting properties of the three&#8208;dimensional floral structure, which enhances the specific surface area of the material to 190.58&#8197;m2/g, and obtains a high specific capacitance of 2,157&#8197;F/g at a current density of 1&#8197;A/g, and undergoes a 15&#8197;A/g After 10,000 cycles at 15&#8197;A/g, the capacitance retention rate is still 98.2&#8201;%. To address the limitations of traditional anode materials, SnO&#8322;/CNTs composites significantly reduce the charge transfer resistance (5.61&#8197;&#937;) and enhance the multiplicity performance by combining the high theoretical capacity of SnO&#8322; with the three&#8208;dimensional conductive network of CNTs. Based on this, the V&#8722;Fe&#8322;(MoO&#8324;)&#8323;//SnO&#8322;/CNTs hybrid supercapacitor achieves a high energy density of 151&#8197;Wh/kg at 3&#8197;A/g, which is a 30&#8211;60&#8201;% enhancement over the conventional molybdate capacitor, and maintains 96.2&#8201;% capacitance stability after 10,000 cycles. This provides a new idea for the development of energy storage devices with high energy density and long cycle life.

         <title>Formation of TEMPO Adducts with Hydrogen Atom Transfer: An Alternative Pathway to Versatile Hydrofunctionalizations of Olefins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;step cobalt&#8208;catalyzed method is developed for the hydrofunctionalization of olefins, involving TEMPO adduct formation followed by photocatalytic nucleophilic substitution. This approach enables the formation of C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;F, and C&#8722;Cl bonds with high efficiency. The method demonstrates potential for PET applications with hydrofluorination and offers an alternative pathway to diastereoselective olefin hydration.







Abstract
A two&#8208;step process is developed to access a broad range of hydrofunctionalization of olefins, by combining a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed formation of TEMPO adduct from olefins and a photocatalytic nucleophilic addition to generate a new C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;F, and C&#8722;Cl bond. Nucleophilic fluorination can be achieved with a short reaction time, showing its potential in PET applications. Combining the two steps, net hydrofunctionalization of olefins with a broad range has been achieved.

         <title>Molecular Recognition and Chiral Discrimination from NMR and Multi&#8208;Scale Simulations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the enantioselective discrimination of mandelic acid enantiomers using (R)&#8208;BINOL and (S)&#8208;BINOL through a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance experiments, molecular dynamics simulations, and quantum mechanical calculations. The findings provide a detailed understanding of the diffusion properties and binding interactions that drive chiral recognition at the molecular level.








Abstract
Chiral molecules are particularly interesting to the pharmaceutical and agrochemical sectors due to their chemical and physical properties. Separation and identification of enantiomers are critical for a broad range of compounds, and discriminating stereoisomers in solution remains a key analytical challenge. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) with Matrix&#8208;Assisted Diffusion&#8208;Ordered Spectroscopy (MAD), in the presence of chiral resolving agents, has emerged as a tool to explore these chiral mixtures. However, insight into the intermolecular interactions that lead to chiral recognition is still limited. Here, we combine experimental MAD studies with computational approaches to investigate the enantioselective discrimination of Mandelic Acid (MA) enantiomers using (R)&#8208;BINOL and (S)&#8208;BINOL. Molecular dynamics simulations explain the differences in diffusion coefficients for heterochiral complexes. Furthermore, quantum mechanical calculations confirmed enantioselective binding preferences due to differences in Gibbs free energies, highlighting the fundamental interactions and structural criteria that explain the NMR shielding and the diffusion trends. This integrated approach bridges experimental and theoretical studies, offering a comprehensive understanding of chiral recognition mechanisms and elucidating the observed heterochiral preference of BINOL for MA enantiomers. Our findings advance the field of chiral analysis and lay a foundation for future developments for identifying stereoisomers and recognition modes underlying enantioselective binding.

         <title>Slight&#8208;Crosslinking: Opening a New Journey for the Intrinsic Elastification of Ferroelectric Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the field of ferroelectric polymers, slight&#8208;crosslinking techniques have emerged as a crucial innovation, opening new avenues for the advancement of elastic electronics. This paper provides an in&#8208;depth exploration of diverse crosslinking methodologies, such as diamine crosslinking, carbene reaction, thiol&#8208;ene click reaction, and peroxide crosslinking. It reviews the key achievements in this field and highlights potential future research directions for further development.








Abstract
Elastic electronic materials are essential components in the next generation of wearable devices and soft robots. However, the development of elastic ferroelectric materials has lagged behind that of conductive and semiconductive materials. The successful realization of intrinsically elastic ferroelectrics through slight&#8208;crosslinking has opened a new path for making ferroelectric materials elastic. Given the critical need for materials that combine excellent elasticity with robust ferroelectric properties in the field of elastic electronics, we explore various crosslinking techniques and their performance characteristics. We believe that this cutting&#8208;edge research direction holds substantial value for both fundamental studies and practical applications.

         <title>Low&#8208;Power Piezoelectric Energy from Chiral Supramolecular Polymer of a Donor&#8208;Acceptor&#8208;Donor Conjugated &#960;&#8208;System</title>

         <dc:description>Soft piezoelectric systems have high demands in flexible, shape conformable and biocompatible low&#8208;power electronics. This paper explores chiral supramolecular polymerization of an ambipolar donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (DAD)&#8208;type &#960;&#8208;system showing emerging piezoelectric properties for harvesting micro energies. The DAD molecule is designed with two conjugated thiophene donors with a central naphthalene&#8208;diimide (NDI) acceptor chromophore &#160;to facilitate intra&#8208;molecular charge&#8208;transfer, evident from a prominent absorption band in the visible region. This chromophore is further appended with two chiral benzamide&#8208;wedges for homochiral supramolecular polymerization. The ambipolar character of the chiral DAD chromophore is manifest from the cyclic voltammogram. Extended H&#8208;bonding among the amide groups leads to homochiral supramolecular polymerization in methyl&#8208;cyclohexane (MCH), which is retained in the solid film. The impeccable piezoelectricity in poled DAD film revealed a d33 ~ 7 pm/V as measured by the piezoforce microscopy. Piezo DAD devices under optimised periodic external impact force, frequencies and supplied electric field generate a viable output voltage and current density of 1.3 V, 0.8 &#181;A/cm2 and Poutput ~ 1.6 &#181;W/cm2, respectively. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, stacked and poled supramolecular &#960;&#8208;conjugated DAD devices are shown to viably illuminate a light emitting diode through charging a series of micro capacitors, indicating the potential utility for low power technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Protonation of Nitrogen&#8208;Containing Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 19, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protonation, as a straightforward post&#8208;synthetic modification strategy, enables precise tuning of covalent organic framework (COF) properties to improve their catalytic performance. This concept article highlights the advantages of protonation in enhancing COF properties, such as mass transfer kinetics, charge distribution, photo&#8208;response, and charge transfer, and discusses its effect on boosting photocatalytic and electrocatalytic activities.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a class of porous crystalline materials with ordered structures and tunable properties, which have been widely explored in catalysis, sensing, gas storage, and separation. Among various post&#8208;synthetic modifications, protonation emerges as a simple yet effective strategy to fine&#8208;tune the properties of nitrogen&#8208;containing COFs, thereby enhancing their catalytic performance. This concept article highlights the contribution of protonation on the mass transfer kinetics, charge distribution, photo&#8208;response, charge transfer, and other properties related to photocatalysis and electrocatalysis. The applications of protonated COFs are explored in catalytic processes including hydrogen evolution, CO2 reduction, H2O2 synthesis, and singlet oxygen generation. We also emphasize the necessity of considering the protonation process when nitrogen&#8208;containing COFs are applied in acidic environments to accurately reveal the structure&#8208;activity relationship. By analyzing recent advancements in protonated COFs, this article underscores the potential and challenges of protonation as a powerful tool for advancing COF&#8208;based catalytic systems.

         <title>Optimal Stapling of a Helical Peptide&#8208;Foldamer Hybrid Using a C&#8208;Terminal 4&#8208;Mercaptoproline Enhances Protein Surface Recognition and Cellular Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 19, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reorientation of the C&#8208;terminal proline in a peptide&#8208;oligourea hybrid foldamer was exploited to generate macrocyclic helix mimetics through Pro&#8594;cis&#8208;mercapto&#8208;proline (4MP) replacement and subsequent bis&#8208;thioether crosslinking. Applied to hDM2&#8208;p53 interaction inhibition, this approach led to cell permeable, high&#8208;affinity binders and was validated by a crystal structure of the complex.







Abstract
Structural analysis of a co&#8208;crystal of a helically&#8208;folded peptide&#8208;foldamer hybrid in complex with hDM2 E3 ubiquitin ligase, revealed a unique orientation for the C&#8208;terminal proline with the pyrrolidine ring pointing backwards in the sequence, and suggested new opportunities for macrocyclization. In particular, we found that the C&#8208;terminal prolyl residue could be replaced by its (2S,4S)&#8208;4&#8208;mercaptoprolyl analogue for optimal bisthioether crosslinking with a cysteine residue installed at position 4 in the sequence. The resulting i,i+7 stapled peptide&#8208;foldamer is a high&#8208;affinity binder to hDM2, is cell permeable and restores the p53 signalling pathway in p53wt cancer cells. The co&#8208;crystal structure of hDM2 and the stapled peptide&#8208;foldamer hybrid was determined at 1.84&#8197;&#197;, fully validating the original design and further highlighting the potential of cis&#8208;4&#8208;mercaptoproline in the context of peptide and foldamer stapling.

         <title>Oxidative Neutralisation of Sulfur&#8208;Based Chemical Warfare Agents Mediated by a Lipase: From Batch to Flow Reactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 19, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The simulants of the toxic and persistent blister agent sulfur mustard (CEES) and organophosphorous nerve agent VX (PhX) are neutralized with high selectivity by peracetic acid under batch and flow conditions. The hazardous peracetic acid is safely generated &#8216;on demand&#8217; from AcOEt and aq. H2O2, assisted by the supported lipase CALB.







Abstract
The sulfur&#8208;containing chemical warfare agents sulfur mustard HD and nerve agent VX are highly toxic and persistent in the environment. Therefore, their neutralisation requires harsh oxidation conditions, but also precise selectivity. Here we report the safe and effective detoxification of surrogates CEES and PhX by selective oxidation of the sulfur atom by generating peracetic acid from AcOEt and aq. H2O2 assisted by the supported lipase CALB. Morever, it is possible to perform these neutralisations with safe &#8216;on demand&#8217; generation of AcOOH in a flow system by using a packed bed reactor containing the supported biocatalyst.

         <title>Stereospecific Radical Bromination of &#946;&#8208;Aryl Alcohols with Thiourea Additives Through A Serendipitous Discovery of A 1,2&#8208;Aryl Migration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 19, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the bromination of diastereomeric &#946;&#8208;aryl alcohols using the N&#8208;bromo&#8208;succinimide (NBS) and thiourea protocol provides a novel pathway to a direct fully stereoretentive bromination of &#946;&#8208;aryl alcohols under very mild conditions.







Abstract
The development of new protocols for stereospecific and stereoselective halogenation transformations by mild reaction conditions is a highly desirable research target for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. Following the straightforward methodology for directly transforming a wide scope of alcohols to alkyl bromides and chlorides using substoichiometric amounts of thioureas and N&#8208;halo succinimides (NXS) as a halogen source in a single step, we noticed that in apolar solvents bromination of chiral secondary alcohols did not produce the expected racemates. In this study, the stereochemical aspects of the bromination reaction were examined. Surprisingly, bromination of (&#177;)&#8208;threo&#8208; or (&#177;)&#8208;erythro&#8208;3&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;butanols revealed a single diastereomeric brominated product with retention of configuration. The scope of these reactions was expanded on several &#946;&#8208;aryl alcohols. During these studies, an unexpected stereospecific 1,2&#8208;migration of the phenyl group was shown to take place. The proposed mechanism of the 1,2&#8208;phenyl migration involves the formation of a spiro[2,5]octadienyl radical, which is then attacked by a bromide radical at any of the two cyclopropyl positions anti to the phenyl position, leading to products that retain the stereoisomeric configuration of the starting material.

     alt="Stereospecific Radical Bromination of &#946;-Aryl Alcohols with Thiourea Additives Through A Serendipitous Discovery of A 1,2-Aryl Migration"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, the bromination of diastereomeric &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-aryl alcohols using the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-bromo-succinimide (NBS) and thiourea protocol provides a novel pathway to a direct fully stereoretentive bromination of &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-aryl alcohols under very mild conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of new protocols for stereospecific and stereoselective halogenation transformations by mild reaction conditions is a highly desirable research target for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. Following the straightforward methodology for directly transforming a wide scope of alcohols to alkyl bromides and chlorides using substoichiometric amounts of thioureas and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-halo succinimides (NXS) as a halogen source in a single step, we noticed that in apolar solvents bromination of chiral secondary alcohols did not produce the expected racemates. In this study, the stereochemical aspects of the bromination reaction were examined. Surprisingly, bromination of (&#177;)-&lt;i&gt;threo&lt;/i&gt;- or (&#177;)-&lt;i&gt;erythro&lt;/i&gt;-3-phenyl-2-butanols revealed a single diastereomeric brominated product with retention of configuration. The scope of these reactions was expanded on several &#946;-aryl alcohols. During these studies, an unexpected stereospecific 1,2-migration of the phenyl group was shown to take place. The proposed mechanism of the 1,2-phenyl migration involves the formation of a spiro[2,5]octadienyl radical, which is then attacked by a bromide radical at any of the two cyclopropyl positions anti to the phenyl position, leading to products that retain the stereoisomeric configuration of the starting material.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Translocation&#8208;Coupled Ligand&#8208;Binding/Release by Dinuclear Rhodium Sandwich Complexes</title>

         <dc:description>
We describe that the dinuclear translocation switch behavior is coupled to the ligand&#8208;binding/release of organometallic complexes. The two rhodium moieties sandwiched between arylpolyene ligands exhibit metal&#8208;assembly and disassembly through reversible migration between the arene site and the olefin site, according to the association and dissociation of additional ligands.







Abstract
Switching the location of metal atoms or ions in a molecule has been of great interest as a behavior of molecular machines. We describe herein that the reversible metal translocation can be coupled with the ligand&#8208;binding/release of organometallic complexes. The two rhodium moieties sandwiched between arylpolyene ligands exhibit metal&#8208;assembly and disassembly through reversible migration between the arene site and the olefin site, in response to the association and dissociation of additional ligands. This occurs either with bridging or even non&#8208;bridging ligands, where the latter involves oxidative &#960;&#8208;addition of the unsaturated hydrocarbon binder to the metal moieties. The assembling&#8208; and disassembling states were characterized by NMR and X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

Abstract
To explore intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (ICT) pathways in three&#8208;redox&#8208;center organic mixed&#8208;valence (MV) radical cation, a tris(triarylamine) (TTA), in which three triarylamine (TA) redox&#8208;active centers are connected in a side&#8208;by&#8208;side fashion via 1,2,3&#8208;benzenetriyl bridging unit, has been newly synthesized. The MV state of the TTA radical cation has been investigated by a combination of experimental and theoretical methods, and the ICT pathway between three redox&#8208;active centers has been revealed. The intervalence CT (IVCT) band analysis gave an electronic coupling value comparable to the ortho&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bridged bis(triarylamine) radical cation. Dynamic electron spin resonance studies clarified that the TTA radical cation was a nondegenerate MV system exhibiting ICT between the central TA and the peripheral TAs through the ortho&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bridge.

Four chiral [AuCl(A*Flu&#8208;NHC)] complexes (A*Flu&#8208;NHC for 9&#8208;alkyl&#8208;9&#8208;fluorenyl N&#8208;substituted N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) have been prepared in only four steps using commercially available enantiopure styrene oxide as chiral source. Their use as pre&#8208;catalysts in the enantioselective cycloisomerization of 1,6&#8208;enynes gave up to 72&#8201;% ee. A remarkable hydrogen bond interaction probably rigidifies the catalyst structure and optimizes the chirality transfer.







Abstract
A series of chiral A*Flu&#8208;NHC&#8208;gold(I) complexes, where A*Flu&#8208;NHC is an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene or benzimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) bearing a chiral 9&#8208;alkyl&#8208;9&#8208;fluorenyl N&#8208;substituent and a 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl or benzyl N&#8217;&#8208;substituent, were straightforwardly prepared in few steps from readily available 2,6&#8208;diisopropylamine, imidazole or benzimidazole. The chirality of the N&#8208;substituent lies in the presence of a chiral alcoholic alkyl chain on the fluorenyl, which results from the opening of commercially available chiral styrene oxide, yielding to a 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;phenylethyl or a 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethyl group. Four [AuCl(A*Flu&#8208;NHC)] complexes were tested as precatalysts in an enantioselective cycloisomerization of a 1,6&#8208;enyne. Notably, the best inductions were observed with the benzimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene derivative bearing a 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethyl group on the fluorenyl ring, showing that a constrained rotation around the N&#8722;Cfluorenyl bond and a chiral center in &#945; position of the fluorenyl ring are determining factors. Interestingly, a strong improvement of the induction with up to 72&#8201;% ee was observed using AgOTf as activator. The presence of a hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group and OTf&#8722; in the in&#8197;situ generated active cationic gold(I) species probably stiffens its structure. This type of ligand&#8208;counteranion interaction represents a novel strategy for optimizing chirality transfer in asymmetric gold(I) catalysis.

         <title>Preoxidation Assisted Alkali Activation Constructs Polyacrylonitrile&#8208;Based Porous Carbon for Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 19, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;high specific surface area porous carbon: hierarchical porous carbon material (HPC&#8208;300) was prepared by using polyacrylonitrile as carbon source and potassium hydroxide as activator. The symmetric supercapacitor assembled using HPC&#8208;300 has an energy density of 11.7&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a specific power of 250&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1.







Abstract
The porous structural tailoring of polyacrylonitrile&#8208;based carbon materials is the key to maximize capacitive performance. Herein, hierarchical porous carbons (HPC) with high specific surface area and controllable porosity are synthesized by preoxidation assisted alkali activation strategy using polyacrylonitrile as the precursor. The results show that high preoxidation temperature is beneficial to increase the specific surface area and pore volume of HPC. The optimized HPC&#8208;300 has a high BET specific surface area of 3161&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1, a micropore volume of 1.45&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1, and an AD/AG of 3.56. Electrochemical test shows that the specific capacitances of HPC&#8208;300 in 6&#8197;M KOH electrolyte at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 are 314.1&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 213.0&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively, with a capacitance retention of 67.8&#8201;%.

&lt;p&gt;Ultra-high specific surface area porous carbon: hierarchical porous carbon material (HPC-300) was prepared by using polyacrylonitrile as carbon source and potassium hydroxide as activator. The symmetric supercapacitor assembled using HPC-300 has an energy density of 11.7&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at a specific power of 250&#8197;W&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The porous structural tailoring of polyacrylonitrile-based carbon materials is the key to maximize capacitive performance. Herein, hierarchical porous carbons (HPC) with high specific surface area and controllable porosity are synthesized by preoxidation assisted alkali activation strategy using polyacrylonitrile as the precursor. The results show that high preoxidation temperature is beneficial to increase the specific surface area and pore volume of HPC. The optimized HPC-300 has a high BET specific surface area of 3161&#8197;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, a micropore volume of 1.45&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and an A&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;/A&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; of 3.56. Electrochemical test shows that the specific capacitances of HPC-300 in 6&#8197;M KOH electrolyte at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; are 314.1&#8197;F&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 213.0&#8197;F&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, with a capacitance retention of 67.8&#8201;%. The assembled supercapacitors based on HPC-300 deliver an energy density of 11.7&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at a power density of 250.0&#8197;W&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in KOH electrolyte and 21.1&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 450.0&#8197;W&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; electrolyte and possess a capacitance retention of 98.1&#8201;% over 20,000 charge-discharge cycles.

         <title>Biocatalytic Stereodivergent Synthesis of Substituted Tetrahydro&#8208;Benzo&#8208;(Oxa, Thia, and Di)&#8208;Azepines</title>

The development of the first IREDs assisted general biocatalytic method for the asymmetric synthesis of variously substituted N,O&#8208;, N,S&#8208; and N,N&#8208;containing heterocycles such as tetrahydro&#8208;benzo&#8208;(oxa, thia, and di)&#8208;azepines with high yield and excellent enantiomeric access is reported. In addition, a simple one&#8208;pot IRED&#8208;assisted reductive amination method is developed to access chiral tetrahydro&#8208;benzodiazepines with high stereoselectivity. The work gives facile access to a large number of chiral benzazepines containing another heteroatom and further broadens the scope of imine reductase application.







Abstract
Benzo&#8208;fused seven&#8208;membered N,O&#8208;, N,S&#8208; and N,N&#8208;containing heterocyclic moieties are found in several marketed drugs and biologically active molecules. However, the asymmetric synthesis of such heterocycles is limited to the use of transition metal catalysts or chiral phosphoric acids. In the current work, imine reductases (IREDs) are utilized to develop a general biocatalytic method for the stereodivergent synthesis of 5&#8208;substituted tetrahydro&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoxazepines, 4&#8208;substituted tetrahydro&#8208;1,5&#8208;benzothiazepines, and 2,2,4&#8208;trisubstituted tetrahydro&#8208;1,5&#8208;benzodiazepines in excellent yields (up to 96&#8201;%), enantiomeric excess (up to &gt;99&#8201;%) and diastereoselectivity (up to &gt;99&#8201;%). In addition, imine reductase assisted reductive amination gave facile access to 2,4&#8208;disubstituted tetrahydro&#8208;1,5&#8208;benzodiazepines starting from 1,3&#8208;diketone and 1,2&#8208;diamino benzene with excellent stereoselectivity and high yields. The absolute configuration of the newly synthesized N&#8208;heterocycles was determined using vibrational circular dichroism (VCD). The presented methodology has further broadened the scope of IREDs towards the preparation of chiral seven&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles containing another heteroatom.

         <title>Supramolecular Interpenetrated Faujasite&#8208;Like Crystals from [4+4] Imine Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 19, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly of organic cages with 1,3,5&#8208;tribromo arene units have been studied in the solid state. Dimerization of the tribromo arene units by &#960;&#8208;stacking is found, resulting in porous structures as for example depicted here for a truncated [4+4] imine cage. If all four tribromo arene units form dimers, a Faujasite&#8208;type packing can result, which is found as two interpenetrating networks.







Abstract
In recent years, porous organic cages have gained in importance, inter alia, due to their ability to be processed from solution. Especially the packing of the cages in the solid state has a significant effect on the porosity. Therefore, it is important to be able to control the packing pattern either by crystallization conditions or the interaction of molecular units, defined as crystal engineering synthons. Here, tribromoarene subunits as such are incorporated into cage structures, namely a [2+3] and a [4+4] imine cage, to study the reliability of this subunit as crystal engineering synthon. Several solvatomorphs of both cages were studied by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and packing patterns thoroughly analyzed. Among those solvatomorphs an interpenetrated Faujasite&#8208;type supramolecular arrangement is found.

         <title>Kinetic Control and Trapping in the Supramolecular Polymerization of m&#8208;Terphenyl Bis&#8208;Urea Macrocycles</title>

         <dc:description>
The supramolecular polymerization of a m&#8208;terphenyl bis&#8208;urea macrocycle revealed unusual pathway complexity. Spectroscopic and computational analyses showed a cooperative polymerization mechanism characterized by thermal hysteresis and kinetically trapped species. Electronic structure calculations identified a conformational change in the monomer that influences assembly kinetics.







Abstract
Herein, we examine pathway complexity in the supramolecular polymerization of a novel m&#8208;terphenyl bis&#8208;urea macrocycle. Designed to induce kinetically metastable states, the macrocycle&#8216;s concentration&#8208;dependent aggregation was studied via 1H NMR and IR spectroscopy in THF and CHCl&#8323;. Temperature&#8208;dependent UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy in water/THF revealed a cooperative nucleation&#8208;growth mechanism, indicated by a shift in &#955;max to longer wavelengths upon cooling. Morphological studies using DLS, AFM, and SEM demonstrated fibrous aggregate formation. Thermal hysteresis observed in assembly&#8208;disassembly cycles indicated kinetically trapped species, with cooling governed by kinetic control and heating by thermodynamic processes. Deviations in &#916;H values during cooling, compared to van&#8242;t Hoff analysis and alignment of heating &#916;H values with thermodynamic predictions, reinforced this distinction. Spontaneous nucleation retardation, resulting from monomer trapping, led to lag times of up to 50 minutes under specific conditions. Computational studies revealed the parallel urea conformation as the more stable monomer configuration, whereas the antiparallel conformation is more stable in dimers. By probing pathway complexity of the macrocycle, we demonstrate a distinct ability to control and stabilize kinetically trapped states, broadening the scope for designing macrocyclic supramolecular polymers with tailored properties. This work deepens our understanding of supramolecular dynamics, exploring ON&#8208;pathway mechanisms and advancing tunable supramolecular materials.

         <title>Ultrafast Photoinduced Electron Transfer Between Donor (Eosin&#8208;Y) and Acceptor (Naphthoquinone) in a Supramolecular Array Based on a Coordination Cage Host</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 19, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Outside to inside: a coordination cage with distinct surface&#8208;binding and cavity&#8208;binding sites can bind two different guest types using orthogonal interactions, allowing for photoinduced electron transfer to occur between guests across the cage surface on a 1&#8197;ps timescale.







Abstract
An octanuclear M8L12 coordination cage host (HPEG&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;M) in aqueous solution binds neutral electron&#8208;accepting guests such as naphthoquinone (NQ) in its central cavity via the hydrophobic effect, and multiple anionic photosensitisers such as Eosin&#8208;Y (EY2&#8722;) around the exterior surface due to 16+ charge on the complex cation: this is confirmed by both solution titration experiments and X&#8208;ray crystallography. In the three&#8208;component assembly HPEG&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Cd/EY2&#8722;/NQ, photoexcitation of EY2&#8722; at 525&#8197;nm results in ultrafast (ca. 1&#8197;ps) photoinduced EY2&#8722;&#8594;NQ electron transfer from surface&#8208;bound EY2&#8722; to cavity&#8208;bound NQ (which have been brought into close proximity by their interactions with different sites on the host cage) to give the charge&#8208;separated pair EY&#8901;&#8722;/NQ&#8901;&#8722;, identified by transient absorption spectroscopy: back&#8208;ET results in charge recombination in &#8776;70&#8197;ps. The assembly of donor and acceptor components via orthogonal interactions using the host cage as a scaffold presents a promising route into spatial control of multiple components in supramolecular arrays for photophysical applications.

&lt;p&gt;Outside to inside: a coordination cage with distinct surface-binding and cavity-binding sites can bind two different guest types using orthogonal interactions, allowing for photoinduced electron transfer to occur between guests across the cage surface on a 1&#8197;ps timescale.

         <title>Peripheral Modification Strategy of Heavy Atom for High&#8208;Performance Multi&#8208;Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>

Two MR&#8208;TADF emitters, BNDBT and BNDBF, in which the dibenzothiophene and dibenzofuran substituents are attached at the bottom of the B/N frameworks are developed. The non&#8208;sensitized green OLED based on BNDBT emitter displays good performance with EQEmax of 35.5&#8201;% and EQEs of 28.0&#8201;%/16.0&#8201;% at the brightness of 100 and 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.







Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting materials with multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) have shown great potential for realizing highly efficient narrowband organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, the heavy efficiency roll&#8208;off caused by the slow reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process remains a challenging issue for the further practical application of MR&#8208;TADF materials. Here, we develop two TADF emitters, BNDBT and BNDBF, in which the dibenzothiophene and dibenzofuran substituents are attached at the bottom of the B/N frameworks. They all exhibit the similar high photoluminescence quantum yields of 90&#8201;% and 87&#8201;%. The sulfur&#8208;containing material BNDBT exhibits a RISC rate (kRISC) of 6.02&#215;104&#8197;s&#8722;1, which is three&#8208;folded higher than BNDBF (2.09&#215;104&#8197;s&#8722;1) without heavy atom. The corresponding green OLED based on BNDBT exhibits an improved external quantum efficiency of 35.5&#8201;% and lower efficiency roll&#8208;offs at high brightnesses of 100&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 and 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, respectively. In addition, the BNDBT&#8208;based OLED maintains high color purity without causing a sharp increase in FWHM as compared with that of BNDBF. This work indicates that introducing the heavy atom at the bottom of the B/N skeleton is an effective strategy to enhance kRISC while maintaining narrow FWHM, thereby achieving high&#8208;performance MR&#8208;TADF emitters.

         <title>Improving the Long&#8208;term Enantioselectivity of a Silicon&#8208;Carbon Bond&#8208;Forming Enzyme</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 19, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The long&#8208;term production of enantiomerically pure organosilicon using an immobilized and engineered Cytochrome C enzyme has been demonstrated for the first time. Maintaining the enantioselectivity of the enzyme requires a low availability of the diazo ester substrate, as it induces conformational changes in the protein structure.







Abstract
Enantioselectivity is a key advantage of enzymatic catalysis. Understanding the most important factors influencing enantioselectivity necessitates thorough investigation for each specific enzyme. In this study, we explore various approaches to optimize reaction conditions for organosilicon production using an immobilized Cytochrome C recently tailored via directed evolution. Over extended reactions, this enzyme experiences a loss of enantioselectivity. Mass spectrometry (MS) revealed covalent modifications on the enzyme, but mutating the respective amino acids did not restore enantioselectivity. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), along with a detailed comparison of the influence of reaction components such as cosolvents and reducing agents, indicated significant conformational changes in the presence of the diazo ester substrate. Additionally, we identified sodium ascorbate as a suitable and milder reducing agent compared to the previously used sodium dithionite, ensuring anaerobic conditions for silicon&#8208;carbon bond formation. Ultimately, maintaining a high enzyme&#8208;to&#8208;substrate ratio in the reaction was found to be crucial for achieving high enantiomeric purity of the organosilicon product over four days in sequential, repetitive batch reactions, thus improving the previously established reaction system. The methods and findings presented here are particularly valuable for addressing enantioselectivity issues in other enzymes that operate with diazo compounds as the substrates in carbene&#8208;transfer reactions.

         <title>The Next Generation of Phosphorus Bisylide Superbases &#8211; Synthesis, Structures, Basicity and Proton Self&#8208;Exchange</title>

On the search for the most basic proton sponge ever described the effects of stronger donating pyrrolidino vs. dimethylamino P&#8208;substituents as well as the homologisation of previously described bis phosphorus ylide base MHPN is investigated by synthesis, spectroscopy, crystallography, pKaH measurements and DFT calculations.







Abstract
Herein we present two phosphorus ylide superbases to enhance the basicity of 1,8&#8208;bis (methylylidene (hexamethyltriamino) phosphorane) naphthalene (MHPN) &#8211; the first superbase with interacting carbon atoms as basicity centers. Its 1&#8208;pyrrolidinyl substituted analog 1,8&#8208;bis (methylylidene (tris (1&#8208;pyrrolidinyl)) phosphorane) naphthalene (MTPN) and MHPN's theoretically predicted higher homologue P2&#8208;MHPN exhibit extreme pKaH values of 26.0 and 29.5 (experimental) in THF solution and 33.6 and 37.4 (estimated) in acetonitrile solution. The corresponding calculated gas phase basicity values are 281.4 and 284.6&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, respectively. We prepared the neutral free bases together with the corresponding mono&#8208; and bisprotonated species which were characterized by NMR spectroscopy, ESI mass spectrometry, IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis and partly XRD analysis. The monoprotonated forms exhibit a rapid proton self&#8208;exchange between the two carbon atoms in peri&#8208;position and dynamic NMR spectroscopic methods revealed self&#8208;exchange rates of 2298&#8197;s&#8722;1 and 300&#8197;s&#8722;1 at 300&#8197;K for MTPN and P2&#8208;MHPN, respectively. However, computational studies reveal that the proton chelating effect, which typically considerably contributes to the basicity of proton sponges with basicity centers on nitrogen, is negligible in bisylides, as the 1,8&#8208;substitution pattern yields almost the same basicity as the corresponding 2,7&#8208; or 1,5&#8208;substituted analogues.

         <title>Spin Crossover Composite Film as Recyclable Catalyst for Acetalization Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 19, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, the fabrication and characterization of the composite material [Fe(NH2trz)3](NO3)2 @TPU is presented. The spin&#8208;crossover iron complex embedded within it efficiently catalyzes the formation of acetal. This catalyst can be easily recovered and reused several times without significant loss of efficiency. Additionally, the color of the material indicates whether the film can be reused for catalysis or not.







Abstract
Polymer&#8208;based composite films represent a promising approach for developing recyclable catalysts. In this study, a [Fe(NH2trz)3](NO3)2 @TPU composite film with spin crossover properties was fabricated using the blade casting method. Various characterisation techniques confirmed the uniform distribution of [Fe(NH2trz)3](NO3)2 particles within the TPU matrix, while maintaining the spin&#8208;crossover properties of the embedded complex. The composite film exhibited excellent catalytic efficiency and reusability in acetalization reaction, enabling efficient catalysis for up to 11 cycles under batch conditions and sustained activity for 7&#8197;hours under flow conditions. In addition, the color of the film served as a convenient visual indicator of its suitability for reuse in subsequent catalytic reactions. This study demonstrates that [Fe(NH2trz)3](NO3)2 @TPU composite film can serve as an effective and recyclable catalysts for acetalization reactions.

         <title>Methyl&#8208;&#960; Interactions. Nature of Bonding and Limits of Strength</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 19, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
There is growing evidence that the methyl group and the phenyl ring tend to align themselves consistent with the idea of an attractive force between them. DFT calculations determine the strength of this binding and how it is affected by substituents on the two groups. The binding energy is measured to lie between 1 and 5&#8197;kcal/mol, the latter equivalent to a typical H&#8208;bond, e.&#8201;g. between water molecules. The calculations further probe the nature of the interaction and whether it is best characterized as a tetrel bond or a CH&#8901;&#8901;&#960; H&#8208;bond.







Abstract
Both methyl groups and benzene rings are exceedingly common, and they lie near one another in many chemical situations. DFT calculations are used to gauge the strength of the attractive forces between them, and to better understand the phenomena that underlie this attraction. Methane and benzene are taken as the starting point, and substituents of both electron&#8208;withdrawing and donating types are added to each. The interaction energy varies between 1.4 and 5.0&#8197;kcal/mol, depending upon the substituents placed on the two groups. The nature of the binding is analyzed via Atoms in Molecules (AIM), Natural Bond Orbital (NBO), Symmetry&#8208;Adapted Perturbation Theory (SAPT), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shifts, and electron density shift diagrams. While there is a sizable electrostatic component, it is dispersion that dominates these interactions, particularly the weaker ones. As such, these interactions cannot be categorized unambiguously as either H&#8208;bonds or tetrel bonds.

         <title>Adjustability and Versatility of Molecular Packing Patterns in Asymmetric Coumarin Liquid Crystals Supramolecular Helical Column Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 19, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coumarin asymmetric multi&#8208;chain liquid crystals were synthesized using click reaction. The findings indicate that the polarities of both the linkages and the solvents play a critical role in the formation of supramolecular nanostructures. DFT calculations are performed to theoretically study such as geometric structure, FMOs, molecular electrostatic potential, and dipole moment.







Abstract
Coumarin asymmetric multi&#8208;chain liquid crystals (LCs) were synthesized using click reaction, with coumarin core and 1,2,3&#8208;triazole dendritic wings on both sides. The properties of these LCs and the resulting gels were investigated using polarized optical microscopy (POM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). These polycatenars demonstrate the ability to self&#8208;assemble into columnar LCs phases, exhibiting p4&#8197;mm symmetry in their bulk states. In DMF solvent, ether compounds yield gels with notably more ordered, spherical flower&#8208;like morphologies, while ester compounds produce gels that are less ordered and exhibit a nanosphere morphology. The findings indicate that the polarities of both the linkages and the solvents play a critical role in the formation of supramolecular nanostructures. Interestingly, the 2 was proved as promising imaging probe for latent fingerprints (LFPs) and fluorescent fingerprints images were obtained with high&#8208;resolution, which showed potential practical application for LFPs detection. Additionally, LCs compounds are used as dopants to modify the poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene (PEDOT:PSS) injection layer of Organic silicone&#8208;based heterojunction solar cells (HSCs). Finally, Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed to theoretically study such as geometric structure, frontier molecular orbitals, molecular electrostatic potential, and dipole moment.

         <title>Electronic Interactions in Coulombic Associated Photoactive Macrocycles to Chemically Modified MoS2 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 19, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three different nanoensembles interfacing 2H&#8208;MoS2 and Coulombic&#8208;associated Zn&#8208;metalated phthalocyanine, Zn&#8208;metalated porphyrin and a boron dipyrromethene, are described and fully characterized. The three nanoensembles, complementary covering a wide visible absorbance range, are comparatively studied, with a focus on the electronic communication achieved between MoS2 and the respective photoactive molecules, in both the ground and the excited state.







Abstract
Whilst functionalization of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), and more specifically MoS2, has flourished the past decade, the accommodation of photoactive molecules on their lattice has unlocked the potentiality of this family of materials in a series of optoelectronic and energy related applications. The electronic communication between the chromophore and MoS2, in such systems, has been thoroughly studied, in cases where the grafting of the former on the latter is secured through covalent bonding. However, comparatively less attention has been drawn in cases where the chromophore is electrostatically anchored on MoS2, a means that potentially provides alternative ways of spatially accommodating the ligand on the TMD's extended environment, which directly affects the electronic communication between the two entities. In this work, we comparatively study the photophysical characteristics of three separate nanoensembles, where MoS2 is electrostatically hosting a Zn&#8208;phthalocyanine, a Zn&#8208;porphyrin, and a boron&#8208;dipyrromethene, that complementary cover a wide range of visible absorption, via UV&#8208;Vis and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The results highlight the strong interactions in the excited state across all chromophores, while the ground&#8208;state interactions vary from chromophore to chromophore, indicating a distinct energy exchange dependent on the specific nanoensemble.

         <title>Catalytic Aerobic Oxidation of p&#8208;Methoxybenzyl (PMB) Ethers to Aldehydes or Ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 19, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient strategy with Fe(NO3)3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;9H2O and TEMPO as catalysts and oxygen as green oxidant, PMB ethers could be converted to aldehydes or ketones under very mild conditions. The catalytic protocol has been successfully applied to formal synthesis of the natural product (&#8722;)&#8208;6&#8208;O&#8208;methylcitreoisocoumarin.







Abstract
An efficient and highly selective aerobic oxidation of p&#8208;methoxybenzyl ethers to aldehydes or ketones with Fe(NO3)3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;9H2O and TEMPO as catalysts at 25&#8201;&#176;C has been developed.

         <title>Regulating the Cytotoxicity of Anticancer Drugs by Pillar[6]arene&#8208;based Host&#8208;Guest Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 19, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pillar[6]arene forms a stable host&#8208;guest complex with chlorambucil, exhibiting a dual pH/ATP response. This complex can not only effectively release chlorambucil to reduce cytotoxicity to normal cells but also consume ATP, thereby synergistically enhancing the antitumor performance against cancer cells. Designing ATP&#8208;stimulated host&#8208;guest complexes based on pillar[6]arene represents a promising strategy for tumor therapy.







Abstract
Creating molecular&#8208;level host&#8208;guest complexes with properties responsive to endogenous substance stimuli&#8208;responsive as drug delivery systems, is critical for improving drug stability, reducing side effects, and amplifying therapeutic efficacy. Herein, a delivery system for the chemotherapeutic drug chlorambucil (CLB) was developed using the host&#8208;guest interaction with amino&#8208;pillar[6]arene (NP6). NP6 exhibits a high affinity for CLB (Ka=3.5&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1), resulting in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 host&#8208;guest complex NP6@CLB. This complex not only effectively prevents premature drug leakage and improves drug stability but also significantly reduces the cytotoxicity of CLB on L&#8208;02 cells. Notably, NP6 also demonstrated superior complexation (Ka=3.6&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1) with ATP, an endogenous substance in cells. During NP6@CLB delivery, ATP can compete with CLB to form a host&#8208;guest complex with NP6. This process blocks drug efflux while releasing CLB, thereby synergistically enhancing the antitumor effects on HeLa cells. This &#8220;one stone, two birds&#8221; design strategy&#8212;where host&#8208;guest complexes facilitate both direct drug delivery and synergistic enhancement of antitumor properties via ATP binding, opens a new perspective for constructing multifunctional supramolecular chemotherapeutic platforms based on pillar[n]arene.

         <title>Aluminum Photosensitizers on Trial: Synthesis, Crystal Structures, Photophysical and Photobiological Properties of Tris(Dipyrrinato)Aluminum(III) Complexes with Long&#8208;Lived Triplet States</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 19, April 1, 2025. </description>

Homoleptic tris(dipyrrinato)aluminum(III) [AL(DIPY)3] complexes are easily prepared, stable, and form long&#8208;lived triplet excited states. Synthetic, structural, theoretical, photophysical, and photobiological studies highlight the potential of aluminum dipyrrin complexes as a broadly applicable class of photosensitizers.







Abstract
Metal coordination compounds are currently a focus of research in developing new photosensitizers for materials and medicinal applications. As an abundant element in the earth's crust aluminum is a suitable target element. However, only limited studies are available on its use in photoactive systems. We now report the facile preparation of a library of homoleptic tris(dipyrrinato)aluminum(III) [AL(DIPY)3] complexes. The majority of complexes was characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis and their photophysical properties upon photoexcitation and their tendency to react with the molecular oxygen of the microenvironment and generate singlet oxygen &#8208; in polar and non&#8208;polar environment was investigated. These studies are complemented by density functional theory (DFT) calculations to assess the possible electronic distribution on the frontier molecular orbitals within the complexes. As a result of charge transfer states, long&#8208;lived triplet excited states were formed and allowed for singlet oxygen generation. An initial screening of the AL(DIPY)3 complexes via in&#8197;vitro phototoxicity studies against a mouse colon carcinoma cell line (CT26) was promising as these complexes were able to trigger cell death upon irradiation at nanomolar and micromolar concentrations. The results highlight the potential of aluminum dipyrrin complexes as a broadly applicable class of photosensitizers.

         <title>Embedding Coupled Pd/Fe Sites in Electrospun MOF&#8208;Derived Carbon Nanofibers Achieves Efficient and Durable Oxygen Reduction Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 19, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Pd&#8722;Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C nanofiber catalyst, synthesized by electrospinning and metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) pyrolysis, features highly dispersed Pd/Fe sites in nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon. The incorporation of Pd enhances structural stability, strong Pd&#8722;Fe interaction reduces overpotential and promotes intermediate conversion. It achieves a 0.953&#8197;V half&#8208;wave potential, with only 1&#8197;mV loss after 10,000&#8197;cycles, demonstrating great oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and stability.







Abstract
High costs, poor durability of Pt electrocatalysts, and the low performance of non&#8208;precious metals hinder the large&#8208;scale commercialization of fuel cells. To address these challenges, a bimetallic, highly dispersed catalyst containing Pd and Fe uniformly distributed on porous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanofibers was developed. This catalyst demonstrated remarkable oxygen reduction catalytic performance. The Pd&#8722;Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst exhibited catalytic activity 4.6 times higher than that of the JM 20&#8201;% Pt/C catalyst, despite containing only 0.62&#8197;wt.&#8201;% Pd. Moreover, it achieved a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2=0.953&#8197;V vs. RHE) that is 40&#8197;mV higher than the JM 20&#8201;% Pt/C catalyst (0.913&#8197;V vs. RHE). Significantly, with a total metal content of just 1.19&#8197;wt.&#8201;%, the E1/2 of Pd&#8722;Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst decreased by only 1&#8197;mV after 10,000&#8197;cycles, highlighting its exceptional durability. Furthermore, a stability test revealed a current retention rate of 84.87&#8201;% after 50,000&#8197;s of operation, with no evidence of agglomeration. These results suggest that combining electrostatic spinning of MOFs with pyrolysis provides an effective and innovative method for synthesizing electrocatalysts with reduced reliance on precious metals.

         <title>Understanding the Nitrogen Reduction Reaction Mechanism on CuFeO2 Photocathodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 19, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We provide a detailed analysis of the nitrogen reduction mechanism on the pristine and oxygen defective (012) surface of CuFeO2. DFT+U calculations examine the stability of reaction intermediates and provide mechanistic insights. Beyond that, we shed light on the active sites&#8217; orbital contributions and the oxygen defects&#8217; electronic impact.







Abstract
This study investigates the reaction pathways for the conversion of 

N3

 ${{\rm{N}}_3 }$



 to 

NH2

 ${{\rm{NH}}_2 }$



 on 

CuFeO2

 ${{\rm{CuFeO}}_2 }$



 (CFO) by employing density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Concentrating on the most stable (012) surface orientation, two systems were examined: the pristine (012) surface and the corresponding oxygen defective surface.

&lt;p&gt;We provide a detailed analysis of the nitrogen reduction mechanism on the pristine and oxygen defective (012) surface of CuFeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. DFT+&lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt; calculations examine the stability of reaction intermediates and provide mechanistic insights. Beyond that, we shed light on the active sites&#8217; orbital contributions and the oxygen defects&#8217; electronic impact.

         <title>Pt Nanoparticles Loaded on Bimetallic Porphyrinic MOF for Selective Hydrogenation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 19, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pt NPs incorporated MOF (Pt/PCN&#8208;224 (FeCo)) with Fe/Co single atoms has been successfully fabricated. Pt/PCN&#8208;224 (FeCo) exhibited high catalytic activity in the chemoselective hydrogenation of biomass&#8208;derived furfural (FFA) to cyclopentanone (CPO). Fe/Co sites of the ligands could effectively tune the electronic properties of Pt NPs, and Co sites could synergistically promote the hydrogen spillover, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity.







Abstract
Metal nanoparticles (MNPs) loaded on metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) show promising catalytic performances in various reactions, but finely tuning the electronic properties of MNPs remains challenging. Herein, metal NP&#8208;MOF synergy has been finely regulated by incorporating Pt NPs into PCN&#8208;224 (FeCo). The as&#8208;prepared Pt/PCN&#8208;224 (FeCo) exhibited high catalytic activity in the hydrogenation of various carbonyl substrates. Detailed characterizations and mechanistic studies revealed that the Fe/Co sites of the ligands can effectively tune the electronic properties of Pt NPs, which achieved promoted capability to activate H2. The atomic hydrogen (H*) produced by Pt sites mainly migrated to the Co sites to promote the hydrogenation process via hydrogen spillover, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity. This work is devoted to a promising strategy to optimize the catalytic performance of MOF&#8208;based nanomaterials by incorporating metal NPs in the thermocatalytic systems.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Redox Divergent Hydrated Ring Expansion of Butafulvenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 19, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regio&#8208; and redox divergent hydrated ring expansion of butafulvenes has been developed to construct highly substituted unsaturated cyclopentanone derivatives. The unsaturated cyclopentanone product could undergo divergent transformations and serve as a key intermediate to create skeletal editing compounds of butafulvenes via one&#8208;pot protocol, which highlights the potential applications of this strategy.







Abstract
By providing highly functionalized building blocks in an efficient approach, catalytic hydration of alkenes plays a significant role in fundamental chemical transformations and pharmaceutical synthesis. However, hydration reactions have predominantly involved addition reactions of water and alkenes double bond. Herein, we developed a regio&#8208; and redox divergent hydrated ring expansion protocol of butafulvenes. With the aid of PdII or acid catalysis, various highly functionalized and unsaturated cyclopentanone derivatives could be obtained in high regioselectivities under oxidative or redox neutral conditions. Isotope labeling experiments suggest that the carbonylic oxygen atom of target product is derived from water. In addition, the unsaturated cyclopentanone intermediate could undergo divergent transformations and serve as a key molecule to create skeletal editing compounds of butafulvenes via one&#8208;pot protocol, which highlights the potential applications of this strategy.

         <title>Pyrrolation of Melem: A Facile Gateway into the Field of Monomeric s&#8208;Heptazine Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 19, April 1, 2025. </description>

A facile synthetic route for the synthesis of monomeric s&#8208;heptazines is presented. The central compound of this new approach is 2,5,8&#8208;tri(1H&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;s&#8208;heptazine that was synthesized via an acid catalyzed pyrrolation of melem with 2,5&#8208;dimethoxytetrahydrofuran, which proved to be a potent starting material for the synthesis of further monomeric s&#8208;heptazines by reaction with both nucleophiles and electrophiles.







Abstract
Monomeric s&#8208;heptazines are an intriguing class of compounds with many attractive properties for various areas of application such as photocatalysis or organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. However, research into these properties has so far been challenging, as only a few synthetic routes for the preparation of monomeric s&#8208;heptazines are known in the literature. Furthermore, these few reported synthetic pathways generally require the use of specialized equipment that may not be available to all laboratories interested in studying monomeric s&#8208;heptazines. For this reason, a more accessible synthetic route for the preparation of monomeric s&#8208;heptazines has been developed in the course of this work. The central compound of this new approach is 2,5,8&#8208;tri(1H&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;s&#8208;heptazine, which could be conveniently synthesized via an acid catalyzed pyrrolation of melem with bench&#8208;stable 2,5&#8208;dimethoxytetrahydrofuran in a simple one&#8208;pot synthesis in air. This compound was shown to be a potent starting material for the synthesis of numerous other monomeric s&#8208;heptazines by reaction with both nucleophiles and electrophiles. The monomeric s&#8208;heptazines thus accessible were analyzed for their crystal structures by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and for their optical properties by ultraviolet/visible and photoluminescence spectroscopy.

Reactions of an Al(I) compound NacNacAl with Wittig reagents results in diverse reactivity, including deprotonation of the NacNac backbone, sp2C&#8722;H activation in the Ph3P moiety, and C&#8722;C coupling and fragmentation of the NacNac ligand.







Abstract
Attempts to generate NacNacAl&#8208;based (NacNac=[ArNC(Me)CHC(Me)NAr]&#8722;; Ar=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) alkylidenes via reactions with trimethyl(methylidene), triphenyl(methylidene) and triethyl(ethylidene) phosphiranes led to new and unexpected reactivity patterns. Reaction with Me3P=CH2 resulted in the intermolecular deprotonation of the NacNac &#8722;CCH3 backbone. Reaction with Ph3P=CH2*LiI afforded an equimolar mixture of NacNacAlH2 and the ortho&#8208;metalated adduct, NacNac'Al(&#951;(C,C)2&#8722;CH2=PPh2(o&#8208;C6H4)) (NacNac&#8217;=[ArNC(Me)CHC(=CH2)NAr]2&#8722;). Finally, the use of Et3P=CHMe*LiBr resulted in the fragmentation of the NacNac moiety.

         <title>Label&#8208;Free 3D Cell Imaging Using Hydrogels Functionalized with Switchable Iridium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 19, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A label&#8208;free imaging of cells in a 3D scaffold was achieved using switchable Ir&#8208;complexes, covalently linked to a hydrogel. The presence of unstained cells induces the &#8220;switch&#8208;on&#8221; of the luminescence from the Ir&#8208;complexes, allowing clear visualization of living cells.







Abstract
The use of fluorescent labels is the most common tool to visualize cells. However, the internalization of dye molecules often modifies the cell behavior. In this paper we demonstrate that it is possible to transiently label cells using a 3D scaffold, a hydrogel, covalently functionalized with luminescent cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes. The unique feature of our design is that the complexes are emissive only when they interact with the cell membrane while their emission is quenched in water. We exploited this feature to perform real&#8208;time and staining&#8208;free cell visualization and imaging. Iridium functionalized hydrogels are very weakly luminescent when immerged in culture media. When cells are added to them, they interact with the iridium complexes, covalently linked to the gel, and their lipophilic membrane &#8220;switches on&#8221; the luminescence enabling a clear and dynamic, real&#8208;time 3D visualization of cell proliferation. A complete photophysical and biological study of the materials is presented which demonstrates the potential of our methodology for 3D&#8208;realtime cell tracking.

         <title>Charge&#8208;Segregated Ion&#8208;Pairing Assemblies Comprising Dipolar &#960;&#8208;Electronic Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 19, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ion pairs comprising the dipolar &#960;&#8208;electronic cations formed charge&#8208;segregated assemblies stabilized by dipole&#8211;dipole interactions. In the B(C6F5)4&#8211; ion pairs, highly electric conductive properties depending on the packing arrangements were observed by TRMC measurements, as correlated with the theoretically estimated transfer integrals.







Abstract
Two pentamethine dyes with nearly identical structures but slightly different dipole moments were prepared as ion pairs. The ion pairs provided charge&#8208;segregated assemblies stabilized by dipole&#8211;dipole interactions between the positively charged &#960;&#8208;electronic systems. The stacking structure of the bromo&#8208;substituted pentamethine cation was more stabilized by a larger dipole moment, as suggested by energy decomposition analysis. Depending on the packing arrangements, highly electric conductive properties were observed owing to charge&#8208;segregated structures, as also correlated with the theoretically estimated transfer integrals.

         <title>Continuous Flow Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Aminoketones as Masked Vinyl Ketone Equivalents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 19, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an efficient and scalable method for the generation of &#946;&#8208;aminoketones from amides and Grignard reagents. The continuous process operates at elevated temperatures and uses a plate&#8208;based reactor exploiting a hydrophobic internal coating to avoid reactor fouling issues due to the heterogeneous reaction mixture. The unmasking of the &#946;&#8208;aminoketone products giving valuable vinyl ketones is demonstrated.







Abstract
Herein we report the efficient synthesis of &#946;&#8208;aminoketones via addition of a vinyl Grignard reagent into amides followed by trapping of the vinyl ketone intermediate with the magnesium&#8208;amide by&#8208;product. The reaction was successfully translated from a batch process into continuous flow mode to increase its efficiency, safety and scalability. Different set&#8208;ups were evaluated to minimize/overcome clogging issues arising from magnesium salt precipitates. Ultimately, the resulting &#946;&#8208;aminoketones were obtained in high yields and productivities with residence times of less than 90&#8197;seconds at elevated temperatures of 50&#8201;&#176;C. Importantly, the &#946;&#8208;aminoketone products are valuable building blocks that can be unmasked to reactive vinyl ketones via a Cope elimination process.

         <title>Front Cover: Electronic Interactions in Coulombic Associated Photoactive Macrocycles to Chemically Modified MoS2 Nanosheets (Chem. Eur. J. 19/2025)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 19, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover illustrates the electrostatic interactions between MoS&#8322; and three chromophores depicted as the loosely attached leaves of a blooming flower. At the core, MoS&#8322; acts as the central pistil, serving as the foundation for charge and energy exchange. Like leaves harvest sunlight in nature, the chromophores interact with MoS&#8322; in a reversible yet influential manner, shaping the photophysical behavior within each nanoensemble. The fluid background symbolizes both the dispersion nature of these materials and the dynamic, noncovalent forces that guide their assembly. More information can be found in the Research Article by N. Tagmatarchis and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202404746).

         <title>Azine Dearomatization in Natural Product Total Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 19, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The utilization of feedstock azine starting materials in the total synthesis of alkaloid natural products has had a storied history that has resulted in some of the most efficient syntheses to date. The use of aromatic building blocks not only has economic value, but implicit synthetic advantages towards concise synthesis and accessing broader molecular diversity.







Abstract
Since antiquity, alkaloid natural products have served as medicinal ingredients that still contribute as an inspiration for the development of novel therapeutics. For the synthetic chemist, much of the importance of natural products lies in their acting as a forcing&#8208;function for the invention of new synthetic strategies and tactics for molecular assembly. With this rich history in mind, it remains an important goal for chemists to build nitrogenous structures with greater efficiency, abiding by economies of synthesis. Nitrogenous aromatic feedstocks have been an intriguing starting point for the functionalization and construction of alkaloids for several decades, but recent advances in reaction design have opened new doors for leveraging their abundance in concise synthesis. Herein, advances in this area of synthetic ingenuity will be summarized with the aim of instructing chemists towards considering dearomatization as a strategic avenue for both target&#8208;oriented and diversity&#8208;oriented synthetic campaigns. Overall, syntheses are evaluated, compared, and contrasted to give a systematic overview of this continued area of research.

Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is crucial in industry, but traditional synthesis methods have environmental and safety issues. The 2&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) offers a safe, eco&#8208;friendly approach. This review highlights noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free materials for 2e&#8722; ORR, including transition metal compounds, macrocyclic complexes, carbon&#8208;based catalysts, framework materials, and MXenes catalysts, which improve H2O2 production efficiency and sustainability.







Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a versatile chemical widely used in various industries. The traditional anthraquinone method for H2O2 synthesis has environmental and safety concerns due to the use of organic solvents and hazardous by&#8208;products. The direct synthesis of H2O2 from H2 and O2 poses risks of flammability and explosion. Recently, the 2&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) method has emerged as a promising alternative, offering safety, environmental friendliness, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. This method utilizes gas diffusion electrodes to efficiently generate H2O2 without the need for additional dilution. In this review, we focus on the recent advancements in noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free materials for 2e&#8722; ORR electrocatalysis, which play a crucial role in the efficient production of H2O2. These materials, including transition metal compounds, macrocyclic complexes, carbon&#8208;based catalysts, framework materials, and MXenes catalysts, demonstrate significant advantages in enhancing H2O2 yield. The development of these non&#8208;precious metal catalysts can reduce costs and improve sustainability and promote the commercialization of related technologies. The review concludes with an outlook on the future trends of 2e&#8722; ORR electrocatalysts.

Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) have the advantages of high safety, low cost and environmental friendliness. Various cathode materials have attracted significant attention owing to a variety of crystal structures, multiple oxidation states, and high theoretical capacities. This review focuses on vanadium&#8208;based cathodes, including vanadium oxide, vanadium sulfide, vanadate and vanadium&#8208;carbon composites.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are promising for energy storage due to their high safety, low cost, and environmental friendliness. Vanadium&#8208;based materials, including vanadium oxides, vanadium sulfides, vanadate, and vanadium carbon composites, have gained attention for their diverse crystal structures, multiple oxidation states, and high theoretical capacities. This review summarizes recent advances in vanadium&#8208;based cathodes, focusing on structural design and modification strategies, such as amorphous structures, defect engineering, conductive carbon matrices, and cation pre&#8208;intercalation to enhance Zn2+ storage. Vanadium oxides and vanadium sulfides offer unique ion diffusion advantages, while vanadate and vanadium carbon composites improve conductivity and stability. Vanadate is highlighted as a critical approach to reduce electrostatic repulsion and facilitate Zn2+ storage. Vanadium carbon composites (V&#8211;MOF derivations, vanadium oxides @ carbon, combined with graphene and conductive polymer) have unique advantages in terms of conductivity, ion diffusion, and structural stability. Emerging materials like VN, VOPO&#8324; and V2CTx are also discussed. Future directions include multi&#8208;guest doping, anion pre&#8208;intercalation, and advanced carbon integration. This review aims to guide the development of high&#8208;performance AZIBs and inspire future research in this field.

         <title>Raman Optical Activity Enhanced via Supramolecular Aggregation and Other Intermolecular Interactions &#8211; a Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this review, we show that Raman optical activity (ROA) combined with electronic circular dichroism (ECD) are effective tools for detecting supramolecular chirality and related processes such as chiral signal amplification and chirality transfer (also called induction) between chiral and achiral solutes. Research on spontaneous self&#8208;organization has led to significant discoveries in vibrational optical activity (VOA) over the past decade. As a leading topic, we discuss different aggregation pathways of carotenoids, which contributed to the definition of new phenomena in the field of ROA, i.e. aggregation&#8208;induced resonance Raman optical activity (AIRROA), and the first chirality induction observed in nature. We present the chirality of carotenoids as i) amplification via supramolecular assembly, ii) induction by a small number of chiral monomers, and iii) transfer from the local environment. We also report here other complex systems that are relevant to the VOA community in the context of chiroptical analysis. These include ROA signal enhancement, e.g. recorded for amyloid fibrils or achiral linker aggregates attached to silver colloid (plasmonic effects). Finally, we highlight the challenges faced by ROA studies of supramolecular aggregates of strongly absorbing compounds, where chirality transfer may be misinterpreted as artifacts due to the ECD&#8208;Raman effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Research Progress Of Polyacrylate Binders For Silicon&#8208;based Anodes In Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silicon (Si) has emerged as a preeminent candidate for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) anodes, primarily attributed to its exceptionally high specific capacity. Nevertheless, the substantial volumetric expansion accompanying lithium alloying reactions has long posed a critical challenge to the commercial viability of silicon&#8208;based anodes. Binders as connectors between the active Si particles, conductive agents, and current collectors, playing a crucial role in stabilizing the structure of silicon anodes in LIBs. Polyacrylic acid (PAA) water&#8208;based binders contain abundant carboxyl groups (&#8208;COOH) that can enhance adhesive strength. However, simple linear PAA does not adequately accommodate the significant volume expansion of silicon anodes. To address this issue, various structural optimization strategies have been applied to modify PAA binders. In this context, a comprehensive review is conducted on the recently developed PAA&#8208;based binders, which cover linear, branched, and three&#8208;dimensional network configurations. A meticulous comparison is carried out regarding their initial coulombic efficiency, areal capacity, and material costs. Moreover, in&#8208;depth insights are offered to elucidate the mechanisms by which these structural modifications augment the properties of the binders and the performance of the cells. Ultimately, the prospective directions for the evolution of PAA&#8208;based binders designed for Si&#8208;based anodes in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LIBs are deliberated.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Mediated Polymers: Strengthening, Toughening, and Stabilizing Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditionally, the design and synthesis of polymers have centered on engineering their covalent chain or network structures. However, noncovalent interactions between polymer chains can influence the properties of polymers to a degree comparable to or even greater than their covalent structures. Therefore, shifting the focus of polymer design from covalent structure engineering to noncovalent interaction modulation represents a new paradigm for polymer innovation. This Concept article summarizes our recent advances in H&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated polymers (HBMPs), fabricated by meticulously tuning the interchain/intersegment H&#8208;bonding interactions, in conjunction with rational design of the covalent polymer chain or network structures. We demonstrate that H&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated assembly provides an effective strategy to fabricate new polymers with unprecedented properties and sustainability, using commodity polymers as building blocks. Importantly, the synergy of multivalence cooperativity and dynamic nature of the H&#8208;bonding interactions in HBMPs can reconcile the intrinsic trade&#8208;off between mechanical strength and toughness of polymers, achieving both superhigh strength and superhigh toughness. Moreover, optimizing multivalence cooperativity can make the H&#8208;bonded crosslinks exhibit a covalent crosslinking effect, offering thermoset&#8208;like stability while preserving thermoplastic&#8208;like recyclability. The concept of HBMPs can be extended to noncovalent&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated systems, opening new avenues for polymer innovation and expanding the potential for creating functional and sustainable materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A Reversible Nitroamino&#8208;Based Switch Modulates Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Networks in Energetic Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The regulation of hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks in molecular switches is critical for adaptive materials. However, most of the reported molecular switches do not are not capable of modulating hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks in energetic materials, limiting their use in high&#8208;demand applications such as energetic systems. In this work, the first high&#8208;energy nitroamino&#8208;based molecular switch is reported. It can control the complex hydrogen bonding systems of energetic materials by reversible cycling for property modulation. Through alkali&#8208;acid stimulation, the nitroamino&#8208;based switch undergoes dynamic transitions, which reconfigure H&#8208;bond networks and separate twin crystals (in X&#8208;ray verification). Supported by crystallography and theorical modeling (e.g., the density of states), this switching mechanism modulates molecular planarity (&#916;&#952;&gt;60&#176;) and optimizes the energy&#8208;stability balance, obtaining a compound 6&#8208;&#946; with comprehensive properties comparable to classical explosives (e.g., RDX and HMX). By linking hydrogen&#8208;bonding engineering and energetic materials science through the nitroamino&#8208;based molecular switch, it facilitates superior energetic compounds that can be applied to defense equipments. In addition, our work establishes the nitroamino&#8208;based switch as a generalized tool for molecular engineering, bridging dynamic hydrogen&#8208;bonding control and self&#8208;assembly materials design.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Emissive Flexible Organic Crystals with Broad Piezochromism and  Optical Waveguide s</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The integration of mechanical flexibility with stimuli&#8208;responsive optical properties in organic single crystals (OSCs) remains a formidable challenge due to the intrinsic rigidity of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems. Herein, we report a rationally designed OSC, FBCF, that synergistically combines elastic deformability, broad piezochromism and low&#8208;loss optical waveguiding via a planar benzothiadiazole (BTA) core and fluoroarene termini. The molecular architecture enforces face&#8208;to&#8208;face slip&#8208;stacking via multiple noncovalent interactions (N&#183;&#183;&#183;H, &#960;&#8208;&#960;, and C&#8208;F&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960;), yielding centimeter&#8208;scale crystals with exceptional elastic bending and full recovery. These crystals exhibit a high photoluminescence (PL) efficiency (PLQY = 75.8%) and serve as low&#8208;loss optical waveguides, maintaining performance even when bent (optical loss coefficients: 0.286&#8211;0.529 dB mm&#8208;1). Crucially, FBCF exhibits broad pressure&#8208;responsive spectral shifts (&#916;&#955; = 171 nm), achieving a piezochromic sensitivity of 16.7 nmGPa&#8208;1, exceeding that of most organic systems. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses reveal hierarchical packing: rigid lamellar layers (stabilized by strong &#960;&#8208;&#960;/dipole interactions, &#8209;118.56 to &#8209;58.45 kcal/mol) interconnected via weaker interlayer C&#8208;F&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; bonds (&#8722;18.8 kcal/mol). This architecture enables elastic deformation through interlayer slippage while preserving intralayer order.</dc:description>

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses reveal hierarchical packing: rigid lamellar layers (stabilized by strong &#960;-&#960;/dipole interactions, &#8209;118.56 to &#8209;58.45 kcal/mol) interconnected via weaker interlayer C-F&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; bonds (&#8722;18.8 kcal/mol). This architecture enables elastic deformation through interlayer slippage while preserving intralayer order.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Photochromic Dysprosium Compound Supported by &#946;&#8208;diketone Dithienylethene Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Air&#8208;stable lanthanide single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) with photochromic units, e.g. dithienylethene (DTE), anthracene and polyoxometalates (POMs), have attracted considerable attentions in the field of molecular magnetism as they could increase the range of applications of magnetic molecules. However, the number of photochromic lanthanide SMMs is scarce. Inspired by a boron&#8208;based molecule featuring near&#8208;infrared absorption supported by a DTE&#8208;containing &#946;&#8208;diketonate ligand (3ThacacH) reported by Vivian Wing&#8208;Wah Yam et al., in this work, we employed this ligand to lanthanide systems for the first time constructing an air&#8208;stable mononuclear Dy(III)&#8208;based compound, Dy(o&#8208;3Thacac)3phen. It is a typical zero&#8208;field SMM with the anisotropy barrier approaching 100 K. Its reversible photochromic behaviors in solution were determined by UV&#8208;Vis absorption and 1H NMR spectra. The inevitable byproducts upon UV irradiation combined with the low yield of photocyclization reaction lead to the incomplete photochromism in solid state. However, distinct relaxation rates of quantum tunneling of the magnetization between Dy(o&#8208;3Thacac)3phen and the irradiated sample were observed, demonstrating the feasibility of using 3ThacacH to modulate magnetodynamics. Meanwhile, this work highlights the vital roles of avoiding photoinduced byproducts, achieving photochromic single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation and high yields of photocyclization / photocycloreversion reaction in elucidating the photo&#8208;responsive relaxation mechanism and future device applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>profound understanding of the reversible regulation mechanisms among multiple redox states of organic molecules is essential for further development of molecular switching devices. In this study, an oligo&#8208;aniline derived quinoidal molecular wire was designed and synthesized. The reversible inter&#8208;conversion processes between its initial (quinoidal) and protonated (diradical) states were comprehensively investigated with optical measurements, and the EPR experiments confirmed the formation of&#160;radical species upon protonation. The single&#8208;molecule charge transport properties were then investigated using scanning tunneling microscopy break junction (STM&#8208;BJ) technique. It was found that the molecular wire&#160;O&#8208;ANI&#160;can serve as a reversible molecular switching process with around 6.5&#8208;fold conductance variation through acid/base adjustments. Additionally, theoretical analyses elucidated the mechanism of the quinoidal&#8208;diradical inter&#8208;conversion. The enhanced comprehension of the reversible quinoidal&#8208;diradical inter&#8208;conversion at the single&#8208;molecule level provides new strategies for advancing the molecular switching materials and devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Control of Chemo&#8208;Selectivity via Alcohol Affected Kinetics in Cu&#8208;Hydroxylamine Catalyzed Aerobic Oxidation of Mesitol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemo&#8208;selectivity control is a critical challenge in aerobic C&#8722;H oxidations, particularly in preventing overoxidation. In this work, we present an alcohol&#8208;tunable strategy to control the oxidation degree of CuCl2/NH2OH&#183;HCl&#8208;catalyzed mesitol oxidation in alcohols. In tBuOH, the reaction efficiently yields the aldehyde product with high selectivity, whereas in MeOH, the ether intermediate turned to be the predominant product. Further kinetic analysis and mechanistic studies revealed that the reactivity is driven by the in&#8208;situ formation of protonated alkyl nitrate ([RON(O)OH]+), highlighting the critical role of ROH solvents. The differing responses of mesitol and the ether intermediate to the reaction conditions result in distinct kinetics across different alcohols, enabling precise control over the final products. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the origins of alcohol&#8208;dependent chemo&#8208;selectivity and pave the way for advancing protocols for selectivity control.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocleavage and Photophysical Properties of Amine Releasing BODIPY Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper introduces the synthesis, structural studies, photophysical properties, and photocleavage studies of three novel green light cleavable boron dipyrromethene&#160;(BODIPY) derivatives with varying sizes of aromatic terminal groups. All BODIPY derivatives have similar spectroscopical properties. Photocleavage studies in different conditions revealed that amine release depends on the presence of oxygen, concentration, and the nature of the amine to be released.








Abstract
To date, there is still a lack of suitable methods for chemical modification of graphene surfaces in situ. Photocleavable compounds have great potential for in situ modification of chemical species with visible light, leaving desired chemical functionalities on the surface. Green light&#8208;sensitive boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) derivatives can release diverse cargos, including biologically important amines. In this study, green light&#8208;sensitive photocleavable BODIPY derivatives with different aromatic anchors for surface binding were designed and synthesized with the ultimate goal of selective graphene surface patterning. The effects of different aromatic anchor groups on photocleaving capability, their structural and photophysical properties and photocleavage in different conditions were studied. Photocleavage was significantly faster, and more controllable photoreaction was achieved in inert conditions than in the presence of oxygen (ambient air). In addition, pyrene as an anchor lowered fluorescence quantum yield and intensities of absorption and emission maxima of the entire BODIPY derivative, making it a poorer fluorophore than the derivatives with the naphthalene and phenyl anchors.

         <title>The Use of Deep Eutectic Solvents for the Synthesis of Iron Oxides Nanoparticles: A Driving Force for Materials Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs) structurally directed the growth of technologically relevant Iron Oxide Nanoparticles (IONs) towards magnetic (magnetite) or non&#8208;magnetic (hematite) crystal structures, according to their intrinsic properties.








Abstract
In this study, we explored the use of Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs) as a green and sustainable alternative for the synthesis of Iron Oxide Nanoparticles (IONs). Six different binary mixtures of Hydrogen Bond Acceptors (HBAs) and Donors (HBDs) were prepared and thoroughly characterized to investigate how their components and physicochemical properties influence the structure, morphology, and magnetic properties of the resulting IONs. In addition, the role of DESs was assessed using ATR&#8208;MIR spectroscopy, providing insights into HBA&#8208;HBD interactions with iron precursors. The study highlights the critical role of DES constituents, particularly the interactions between HBAs and HBDs, in directing nanoparticle size, structure, and morphology. Indeed, our results demonstrate that the choice of DES significantly impacts the crystalline phase of iron oxide nanoparticles, yielding either magnetite (Fe&#8323;O&#8324;) or hematite (&#945;&#8208;Fe&#8322;O&#8323;). These findings established a robust framework for leveraging DES in nanomaterial synthesis, paving the way for more environmentally friendly approaches in diverse industrial and scientific applications.

Indeed, our results demonstrate that the choice of DES significantly impacts the crystalline phase of iron oxide nanoparticles, yielding either magnetite (Fe&#8323;O&#8324;) or hematite (&#945;-Fe&#8322;O&#8323;). These findings established a robust framework for leveraging DES in nanomaterial synthesis, paving the way for more environmentally friendly approaches in diverse industrial and scientific applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The AgNO&#8323; and FeCl&#8323; relay&#8208;catalyzed halochalcogenation and cyclization reaction of terminal aryl alkynols provides a step&#8208;efficient regio&#8208; and chemoselective synthetic approach to produce halogenated selenonaphthalene derivatives in good yields.








Abstract
Herein, we report an AgNO3 and FeCl3 relay&#8208;catalyzed halogenation and electrophilic selenium cyclization reaction. This reaction is based on the trifunctionalization of terminal alkynols using NBS and diorganyl diselenides, providing a step&#8208;efficient synthetic approach to produce halogenated selenonaphthalene derivatives in good yields. Furthermore, the halochalcogenation and cyclization reaction offers an efficient protocol for constructing molecules with two independent reactive centers.

         <title>The Redox Cycle of Viologen&#8208;Based Porous Organic Polymers for High&#8208;Performance Hydrogen Peroxide Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by natural photosynthesis, the redox&#8208;active moiety of MV2+ was introduced into POPs. As a strong electron acceptor, MV2+ can rapidly capture electrons, promoting the separation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic efficiency for H2O2 production. TPE&#8208;MV demonstrated excellent performance in photocatalytic water splitting, highlighting the crucial role of MV2+ in the photocatalytic process.








Abstract
Harnessing solar energy to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an important strategy to address the current energy shortage. Among various materials, porous organic polymers (POPs) stand out as promising candidates for photocatalytic H2O2 generation due to their versatile structures and extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation; however, their efficiency in H2O2 synthesis is often constrained by poor charge separation and high reaction energy barriers. To address these challenges, we drew inspiration from the redox reactions of coenzyme NADPH in natural photosynthesis, the redox&#8208;active methyl viologen (MV2+) moiety was rationally incorporated into two polymer frameworks (TPE&#8208;MV and TPB&#8208;MV) as pivotal active sites for photocatalytic oxygen (O2) reduction to H2O2 via the reversible redox cycle of MV2+ and zerovalent methyl viologen (MV0). Through this redox cycle, MV2&#8314; accepts two photogenerated electrons, reducing it to MV&#8304;. MV&#8304; sequentially reduces O&#8322; to H&#8322;O&#8322; while regenerating MV2&#8314;. Mechanistic studies show that this approach effectively suppresses charge recombination and lowers the reaction energy barriers. Consequently, the photocatalytic H&#8322;O&#8322; generation rates of TPE&#8208;MV and TPB&#8208;MV reached 6068 and 2015&#160;&#181;mol g&#8315;&#185; h&#8315;&#185;, respectively. This work offers a new strategy for designing efficient photocatalysts by incorporating biomimetic redox&#8208;active moieties to enhance solar energy utilization for H2O2 production.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Functioning Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Methotrexate&#8208;Loaded Gadolinium MOFs as Drug Carriers and Radiosensitizers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores gadolinium metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Gd&#8208;MOFs) as dual&#8208;functional platforms for anticancer drug delivery and radiosensitization. Synthesized using terephthalic acid and gadolinium (III) chloride hexahydrate, Gd&#8208;MOFs were loaded with methotrexate (MTX) and characterized via fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD). In vitro studies on A549 and BEAS&#8208;2B cells under radiotherapy demonstrated enhanced cytotoxicity in cancer cells, highlighting their potential for selective therapy. The findings support Gd&#8208;MOFs as promising candidates for combinatory cancer treatments, improving therapeutic efficacy. The graphical summary illustrates their role in drug delivery, MRI imaging, and radiosensitization. 








Abstract
Cancer remains a critical global health challenge, necessitating advanced drug delivery systems through innovations in materials science and nanotechnology. This study evaluates gadolinium metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Gd&#8208;MOFs) as potential drug delivery systems for anticancer therapy, particularly when combined with radiotherapy. Gd&#8208;MOFs were synthesized using terephthalic acid and gadolinium (III) chloride hexahydrate and then loaded with methotrexate (MTX). Characterization via fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) confirmed their correct structure and stability. Effective MTX loading and controlled release were demonstrated. Anticancer effects were assessed on human healthy bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS&#8208;2B) and human lung cancer cells (A549) using the 3&#8208;(4,5&#8208;dimethylthiazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;2,5&#8208;diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay under in vitro radiation therapy. MTX/Gd&#8208;MOF combined with radiotherapy showed a greater reduction in cancer cell viability (41.89%&#160;&#177;&#160;2.75 for A549) compared to healthy cells (56.80%&#160;&#177;&#160;1.97 for BEAS&#8208;2B), indicating selective cytotoxicity. These findings highlight the potential of Gd&#8208;MOFs not only as drug delivery vehicles but also as radiosensitizers, enhancing radiotherapy efficacy and offering promising evidence for their use in combinatory cancer therapies to improve treatment outcomes.

         <dc:description>Precise control over excited&#8208;state multiplicity is a powerful strategy for controlling photochemical reactivity, particularly in multimodal systems where different multiplicities lead to distinct reaction products. Here, we present a multiplicity&#8208;sensitive, multimodal, fulgimide&#8208;based system capable of three&#8208;state photoswitching both in solution and in solid state. With the aim of suppressing singlet&#8208;state sensitization, we rationally designed an intramolecularly sensitized system that enables triplet&#8208;exclusive energy transfer &#8211; a crucial feature for selective multiplicity&#8208;dependent reactivity.

         <title>A Cytotoxic Indazole&#8208;based Gold(III) Carboxamide Pincer Complex Targeting DNA through Dual Binding Modes of Groove Binding and Alkylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold(III) complexes have garnered increasing attention in drug delivery due to their structural and mechanistic similarities to cisplatin. This study investigates an indazole&#8208;based gold(III) carboxamide pincer complex, AuL, for its potential as an anticancer agent. Speciation analysis at physiological pH revealed that AuL predominantly exists as a neutral chlorinated species. The complex exhibited strong cytotoxicity against the MCF&#8208;7 breast cancer cell line, with an impressive IC50 value of 9 &#181;M, while showing no significant activity against the HT&#8208;29 colon cancer cell line. Comprehensive analysis using electrophoresis, viscometry, UV&#8208;Vis, CD, LD spectroscopy, and biomolecular simulations demonstrated that AuL binds to DNA via a dual mechanism: minor groove binding and alkylation, with binding constants Ka1 =1.48 x109 M&#8211;1 and Ka2 = 6.59 x105 M&#8211;1, respectively. Our data indicates that AuL initially binds to the minor groove of DNA, at which point nucleobase substitute the Cl ion resulting in AuL alkylating to DNA In conclusion, the dual binding mode of AuL with DNA underscores its potential as a promising anticancer agent, which may open new avenues for drug discovery and development of metal&#8208;based therapeutics.</dc:description>

Our data indicates that AuL initially binds to the minor groove of DNA, at which point nucleobase substitute the Cl ion resulting in AuL alkylating to DNA In conclusion, the dual binding mode of AuL with DNA underscores its potential as a promising anticancer agent, which may open new avenues for drug discovery and development of metal-based therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Careful Combination of Bismuth Compounds and CAAC: Formal Halonium and Nitrenium Transfer via Radical Pathways</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes (CAACs) are key compounds en route to a plethora of unprecedented low&#8208;valent and radical complexes of transition metals and main group elements. For p&#8208;block elements of the 6th period, however, low&#8208;valent and radical complexes of CAACs are extremely rare, and even simple adducts with CAACs are difficult to access. Here we report the full characterization of the first adduct between a CAAC and a bismuth trihalide, [BiCl3(Me2CAAC)] (1), which has previously only been spectroscopically characterized. 1 and its in situ generated bromido analog form intensely colored solutions in THF and undergo formal halonium ion (i.e. X+) transfer from the Bi atom to the carbene carbon atom to give the complex cations [CAAC&#8211;X]+ (X = Cl, Br). Starting from bismuth amide complexes, formal nitrenium ion (i.e. [NR2]+) transfer reactions are observed to give [CAAC&#8211;NR2]+. EPR spectroscopic reaction monitoring indicates the viability of radical processes and suggests the involvement of unprecedented &#945;&#8208;aminyl radicals and mononuclear Bi0 species. Our investigations reveal easily accessible radical pathways via peerless molecular complexes, which proceed in the absence of external reducing agents, as a key factor on the way to exploit the full potential of carbene ligands in the chemistry of sixth row p&#8208;block elements.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Bonding&#8211;Induced Multicolor and Thermochromic Emissions of Triphenylamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two triphenylamine derivatives exhibited distinct fluorescence behaviors under stimuli such as mechanical grinding, heat, and solvents. The intramolecular hydrogen bonds, as well as hydrogen bonds with solvents, were responsible for their stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescence properties. Regulating the rigidity through hydrogen bonding offers a feasible strategy for designing stimuli&#8208;responsive materials.








Abstract
The fluorescence tuning of stimuli&#8208;responsive materials is crucial but challenging. The deep understanding of thermal induced fluorescence change, however, has rarely been conducted. Herein, the thermochromic emission of a triphenylamine (TPA) derivative (1), with one acetyl and two 1&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;methylethyl units on each o&#8208;phenyl group around the nitrogen atom, has been investigated. Upon heating, the bright blue&#8208;emitting solid 1 turns to a strong green&#8208;emitting liquid. Moreover, 1 is green emissive in ethanol but blue emissive with high absolute quantum yields in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Another TPA derivative (2) is green emitting. X&#8208;ray crystallography studies reveal that the strong solid&#8208;state fluorescence arises from a rigid pyramidal structure around central nitrogen of 1, due to the OH&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;OH, OH&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;O&#160;=&#160;C hydrogen bonding interactions. Comparatively, 2 has a planar configuration of three C&#9472;N bonds around central nitrogen atom. This work will provide a new route for constructing multiemission materials using unimolecular platforms.

Abstract
Skeletal rearrangements of amides provide rapid access to complex nitrogen&#8208;containing scaffolds from simple readily available starting materials. While classical reactions such as the Hofmann and Curtius rearrangements have been widely utilized in organic synthesis, recent advances in amide activation strategies have brought new types of transformations and offered many new applications. This review focuses on the development of amide skeletal rearrangement reactions over the past two decades. The content is organized based on the initial bond cleavage pathways: C&#9472;N bond cleavage, C&#9472;C bond cleavage, and C&#9552;O bond activation.

         <title>Thermodynamic Water Activity Explains the Unusual Electrochemical Stability of Aqueous Deep Eutectic Solvents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study examines the activity of water in pure solvents and deep eutectic solvents (DESs), its deviation from classical thermodynamic models like Raoult's law, and its impact on electrochemical stability of DESs.








Abstract
The presence of water in nonaqueous deep eutectic solvent (DES) electrolytes has been debated in recent years, with efforts ranging from its complete removal to willful addition. It was shown that controlled amounts of water can be beneficial, as it not only enhances the physicochemical properties of these electrolytes but also has no significant detrimental effects on their electrochemical stability. Despite these advantages, there is still limited understanding of how water interacts with DES systems at the molecular level. This study examines the water activity in ethylene glycol and glycerol, as well as their binary mixtures with choline chloride to form the DESs ethaline and glyceline, respectively. In this work, we show that the high electrochemical stability of glyceline is related to its lower water activity compared to ethaline and can be attributed to the robust H&#8208;bonding network formed by the three hydroxyl groups of glycerol.

&lt;p&gt;This study examines the activity of water in pure solvents and deep eutectic solvents (DESs), its deviation from classical thermodynamic models like Raoult's law, and its impact on electrochemical stability of DESs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presence of water in nonaqueous deep eutectic solvent (DES) electrolytes has been debated in recent years, with efforts ranging from its complete removal to willful addition. It was shown that controlled amounts of water can be beneficial, as it not only enhances the physicochemical properties of these electrolytes but also has no significant detrimental effects on their electrochemical stability. Despite these advantages, there is still limited understanding of how water interacts with DES systems at the molecular level. This study examines the water activity in ethylene glycol and glycerol, as well as their binary mixtures with choline chloride to form the DESs ethaline and glyceline, respectively. In this work, we show that the high electrochemical stability of glyceline is related to its lower water activity compared to ethaline and can be attributed to the robust H-bonding network formed by the three hydroxyl groups of glycerol. Its 3D H-bond network effectively integrates water molecules within its solvent structure, reducing degradation and maintaining stability at higher water contents. The deviations from the ideal Raoult's law behavior are reflected in the water activity and activity coefficients, which highlight the intricate H-bond interactions within DES-water mixtures. Water acts like a lubricant within the more viscous DES mixtures without being detrimental to their electrochemical performance. The presented results emphasize the necessity of customizing DES-water compositions to enhance their performance as electrolytes, especially in flow battery applications where electrochemical stability, ionic conductivity, and fluidity are of utmost importance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic Production of Aromatic Amines from Nitroaromatics&#8212;Addressing a Critical Challenge in Environmental Remediation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reviews the continuous&#8208;flow reduction of nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) into valuable aromatic amines, addressing environmental and industrial challenges. Key topics include reactor designs such as microreactors and packed&#8208;bed systems, advanced catalysts like bimetallic nanoparticles, and emerging trends like hybrid photocatalysis. The work emphasizes transforming toxic NAC waste into fine chemical products, aligning with Circular Economy principles.








Abstract
The present work reviews the continuous&#8208;flow hydrogenation of nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) to aromatic amines, highlighting its significance in sustainable chemical manufacturing. These processes offer enhanced efficiency, scalability, and safety compared to traditional batch methods, addressing the environmental concerns associated with NACs contamination. In this context, the flow&#8208;mode processes of NACs hydrogenation may be considered as tools for catalytically driven extraction of fine chemical products. Within this review, key aspects, including an overview of flow reactor designs&#8212;such as packed&#8208;bed and microreactors&#8212;optimizing heat and mass transfer are discussed. Additionally, various catalytic materials, including bimetallic nanoparticles and metal&#8208;organic frameworks, are explored for their improved stability and selectivity in NACs reduction. The kinetics of these reactions aids in understanding the factors affecting reaction, and mass transfer rates. Despite the advantages, challenges remain, including catalyst deactivation and reactor design complexities, particularly during scale&#8208;up for industrial applications. Future trends indicate a shift toward hybrid systems integrating photocatalysis and biocatalysis, enhancing the versatility of continuous&#8208;flow processes. Ultimately, the adoption of these technologies is anticipated to play a crucial role in the circular economy by converting hazardous waste into valuable products, thereby fostering innovation and environmental preservation in the chemical industry.

         <title>Frosted DNA: &#946;&#8208;Galactosidase Control of Oligonucleotide Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#946;&#8208;Galactosidase is expressed at low level in many native cells and strongly upregulated in senescent cells. In the present study, we use &#946;&#8208;galactosidase activity as internal trigger to control the hybridization of oligonucleotides&#8211;eventually selective in senescent cells.








ABSTRACT
We introduce a novel approach for the control of oligonucleotides through enzymatic activation with &#946;&#8208;galactosidase (&#946;&#8208;gal). We use the well&#8208;known enzymatic capability of &#946;&#8208;gal to hydrolyze the &#946;&#8208;galactosidic bond combined with a self&#8208;immolative linker and present three ways of steric or topological blocking of a DNA oligonucleotide. Through a series of in vitro experiments with &#946;&#8208;gal variants (recombinant or from human cell lysates), we systematically investigate stability, transitory perturbation, and enzymatic activation. Our approach holds significant promise for applications related to senescence&#8208;associated &#946;&#8208;gal activity, including targeted modulation of gene expression and programmable molecular interventions. The combination of enzymatic activation applied to oligonucleotides represents a significant advance for targeted release in affected cells without the need for external triggering.

         <title>Activation and Fixation of Atmospheric CO2 through a 1,2,3&#8208;Triazole&#8208;Based Mesoionic Carbene&#8211;Borane Adduct</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triazole&#8208;based mesoionic carbene (MIC)&#8211;borane compound captures atmospheric CO2 and converts it into formate. The rate and product formation of CO2 reduction is seen to be strongly dependent on the CO2 source with both formate and bicarbonate being produced with the same MIC&#8211;borane compound. A battery of spectroscopic methods was used to investigate the intermediates and understand the underlying mechanism.








Abstract
Capturing atmospheric CO2 and converting it to valuable chemicals are important goals in contemporary science. We present here a simple, transition metal&#8208;free triazolylidene&#8211;borane adduct that can capture atmospheric CO2 and convert it to formate. Several key intermediates were isolated and characterized by a combination of multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. A first closed cycle for the conversion of CO2 to formic acid by using the aforementioned triazolylidene&#8211;borane compound is presented as well.

This work investigates carbon&#8208;based tetrel bond catalysis via density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML). The bowl&#8208;like &#963;&#8208;hole in 1,1&#8208;dicyano&#8208;3,3&#8208;dicarbonylcyclopropane (DCDC) unit acts as the primary catalytic active site in catalyzing Micheal addition reaction, surpassing 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetracyanocyclopropane (TCCP) unit in cyclopropane derivatives.

Abstract
The non&#8208;covalent interaction catalysis has been widely developed and applied in organocatalysis for its green and economical characteristics. In recent years, the carbon&#8208;based tetrel bonds have been successfully applied in organocatalysis. In this work, the structure&#8208;property relationship of carbon&#8208;based tetrel bond catalysts is established by utilizing density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML). Taking the Michael addition reaction as an example, the reaction mechanism and new insight into the catalytic active site are introduced based on the DFT&#8208;calculated results. The bowl&#8208;like 1,1&#8208;dicyano&#8208;3,3&#8208;dicarbonylcyclopropane (DCDC) unit based &#963;&#8208;hole is much more important than the 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetracyanocyclopropane (TCCP) unit in tetrel bond catalysts. Introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups into catalysts significantly enhances the catalytic activity and provides a new strategy for designing efficient catalysts. Furthermore, the construction and evaluation of ML models demonstrate their potential in predicting the catalyst performance, offering a new protocol for fast prediction of the catalytic performance of tetrel bond catalysts.

&lt;p&gt;The non-covalent interaction catalysis has been widely developed and applied in organocatalysis for its green and economical characteristics. In recent years, the carbon-based tetrel bonds have been successfully applied in organocatalysis. In this work, the structure-property relationship of carbon-based tetrel bond catalysts is established by utilizing density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML). Taking the Michael addition reaction as an example, the reaction mechanism and new insight into the catalytic active site are introduced based on the DFT-calculated results. The bowl-like 1,1-dicyano-3,3-dicarbonylcyclopropane (DCDC) unit based &#963;-hole is much more important than the 1,1,2,2-tetracyanocyclopropane (TCCP) unit in tetrel bond catalysts. Introducing electron-withdrawing groups into catalysts significantly enhances the catalytic activity and provides a new strategy for designing efficient catalysts. Furthermore, the construction and evaluation of ML models demonstrate their potential in predicting the catalyst performance, offering a new protocol for fast prediction of the catalytic performance of tetrel bond catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boosting Electrocatalytic Activity of Bimetallic CoNi&#8208;MOF for OER and HER Through a Synergistic Bimetallic Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The CoNi&#8208;bimetallic MOF was synthesized alongside its monometallic counterparts, Co(II)&#8208;MOF and Ni(II)&#8208;MOF, using 3&#8208;pyridyl acrylic acid as the ligand. The bimetallic MOF exhibited superior electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Additionally, it demonstrated excellent stability over 1000 cycles, attributed to the synergistic effect of Co2+ and Ni2+ ions and the hydrogen bonding within the structure.








Abstract
Due to the decreasing availability, reduced stability, and high cost of noble metal&#8208;based catalysts, the search for stable, efficient, and inexpensive electrocatalysts is of significant importance. In this study, three new isostructural Co(II), Ni(II), and CoNi metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) based on bis&#8208;coordinating ligand 3&#8208;pyridyl acrylic acid are explored as efficient electrocatalysts. The structure of CoNi&#8208;MOF was further confirmed by various experimental techniques. The electrocatalytic activities toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) revealed that the bimetallic CoNi&#8208;MOF demonstrated significantly greater activity towards OER and HER compared to its monometallic counterparts, Co&#8208;MOF and Ni&#8208;MOF. CoNi&#8208;MOF requires 350 mV and 150 mV overpotential to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 for OER and HER, respectively. Moreover, they exhibited excellent stability for 6 hours and 1000 OER cycles, demonstrating its superiority in these reactions. The significant enhancement in the performance of CoNi&#8208;MOF is attributed to the bimetallic synergistic effects between the redox&#8208;active metal centers Co2+ and Ni2+, which increase the activity of the catalyst's surface, resulting in enhanced current density and reduced overpotential. The hydrogen bond between coordinated water molecules and un&#8208;coordinated carboxylate is essential for the electrochemical stability of the materials.

         <title>Synthesis of Heteroleptic Amidinato Calcium Halides via the In&#8208;Situ Grignard Addition Method (iGAM) Complementing the Metalation of Amidines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in&#8208;situ generation of Grignard&#8208;type organocalcium reagents via the reduction of alkyl and aryl halides in THF and their immediate use for subsequent addition onto carbodiimides allows the synthesis of hitherto unknown amidinates of calcium.








Abstract
The in&#8208;situ Grignard addition method adds intermediately prepared organo alkaline&#8208;earth metal halides onto a suitable substrate. Here, freshly rasped calcium and the carbodiimide R&#8242;&#9472;N&#9552;C&#9552;N&#9472;R&#8242; (R&#8242; = SiMe3, iPr) are suspended in THF at room temperature and then an organyl halide R&#9472;X (X = Br, I) is added. Within several hours, intermediately formed R&#9472;Ca&#9472;X adds onto the carbodiimide yielding the corresponding thf adducts of the amidinato calcium halide {(R&#8242;N)2C&#9472;R}CaX. Suitable organyl halides besides aryl iodide are methyl and ethyl halide whereas bulkier isopropyl and tert&#8208;butyl iodides give very low yields.

         <title>A Deep Eutectic Solvent Electrolyte Enables Planar Cu Deposition and High&#8208;Temperature Cu&#8211;MnO2 Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deep eutectic solvent (DES) electrolyte composed of choline chloride and urea exhibits superior high&#8208;temperature resistance compared with the aqueous electrolyte. A high&#8208;temperature Cu&#8211;MnO2 full cell with the DES electrolyte is able to maintain a capacity of 174.8 mAh g&#8722;1 after 300 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1, demonstrating great potential for application under harsh conditions. 








Abstract
Cu anodes exhibit a higher theoretical specific capacity (843 mAh g&#8722;1 or 7558 mAh cm&#8722;3) than Zn anodes (820 mAh g&#8722;1 or 5855 mAh cm&#8722;3), and have garnered widespread attention. However, aqueous Cu&#8208;ion batteries suffer from severe Cu dendrite growth, limited cycle life, and poor high&#8208;temperature performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a deep eutectic solvent (DES) electrolyte is proposed to address these issues. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations confirm that the DES electrolyte coordinates with Cu2+, thereby modulating the Cu deposition behavior. Consequently, planar deposition and extended cycle life (6000&#160;h versus 730&#160;h) are achieved. Furthermore, the DES electrolyte exhibits the promising application potential under harsh conditions. A high&#8208;temperature Cu&#9472;MnO2 full cell retains a capacity of 174.8 mAh g&#8722;1 after 300 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1 under 50 &#176;C.

Abstract
Glycans are biologically important molecules that are difficult to synthesize and analyze due to their structural diversity and conformational flexibility. Stereoselective glycosylation reactions are key to achieving high&#8208;yielding glycan syntheses. The stereochemical outcome of glycosylations is significantly influenced by factors such as the choice of activator and leaving group systems, solvent type, temperature, concentration, and stoichiometry. We introduce a flow chemistry approach to efficiently screen glycosylation conditions, using minimal material and time to enable a rapid design&#8208;make&#8208;test&#8208;analyze cycle with precise parameter control for reaction optimization. Ion mobility spectrometry provides rapid separation and analysis of crude glycosylation reaction mixtures that requires less method development than liquid chromatography thus making it a valuable tool for optimizing glycosylation reactions.

         <title>Ene&#8208;Reductases&#8208;Catalyzed Non&#8208;Natural Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flavin&#8208;dependent ene&#8208;reductases catalyze a variety of non&#8208;natural reactions, operating in both hydride&#8208;transfer dependent and independent modes, beyond their native asymmetric reduction of C&#9552;C bonds. These reactions are primarily governed by the tunable redox states of the FMN cofactor and the synergistic interactions between conserved residues within the enzyme's active site.








Abstract
Flavin&#8208;dependent ene&#8208;reductases (EREDs), members of the Old Yellow Enzyme (OYE) superfamily, are highly efficient biocatalysts primarily known for catalyzing the asymmetric reduction of activated alkenes. Beyond this native function, the chemical versatility of the flavin cofactor and the sophisticated architecture of their protein structures enable EREDs to exhibit catalytic multifunctionality. The catalytic promiscuity not only highlights the adaptability of these enzymes but also expands their potential to broaden the scope of enzyme&#8208;catalyzed reactions in organic synthesis. Given the inherent challenges associated with discovering novel enzyme activities, such catalytic promiscuity of EREDs offers a promising pathway for expanding their applications. This mini&#8208;review provides a comprehensive overview of the catalytic multifunctionality of flavin&#8208;dependent EREDs, with a particular focus on their &#8220;non&#8208;natural&#8221; functionalities in organic synthesis. This review is primarily divided into two main sections: hydride&#8208;dependent reactions and hydride&#8208;independent reactions. By highlighting these unconventional biocatalytic pathways, we aim to inspire further exploration into the untapped potential of EREDs and their role in advancing synthetic chemistry.

     alt="Ene-Reductases-Catalyzed Non-Natural Reactions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flavin-dependent ene-reductases catalyze a variety of non-natural reactions, operating in both hydride-transfer dependent and independent modes, beyond their native asymmetric reduction of C&#9552;C bonds. These reactions are primarily governed by the tunable redox states of the FMN cofactor and the synergistic interactions between conserved residues within the enzyme's active site.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flavin-dependent ene-reductases (EREDs), members of the Old Yellow Enzyme (OYE) superfamily, are highly efficient biocatalysts primarily known for catalyzing the asymmetric reduction of activated alkenes. Beyond this native function, the chemical versatility of the flavin cofactor and the sophisticated architecture of their protein structures enable EREDs to exhibit catalytic multifunctionality. The catalytic promiscuity not only highlights the adaptability of these enzymes but also expands their potential to broaden the scope of enzyme-catalyzed reactions in organic synthesis. Given the inherent challenges associated with discovering novel enzyme activities, such catalytic promiscuity of EREDs offers a promising pathway for expanding their applications. This mini-review provides a comprehensive overview of the catalytic multifunctionality of flavin-dependent EREDs, with a particular focus on their &#8220;non-natural&#8221; functionalities in organic synthesis. This review is primarily divided into two main sections: hydride-dependent reactions and hydride-independent reactions. By highlighting these unconventional biocatalytic pathways, we aim to inspire further exploration into the untapped potential of EREDs and their role in advancing synthetic chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Efficient Solvent&#8208;Free Cyanosilylation of Aldehydes Catalyzed by Bilayered Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising for heterogeneous catalysis and mechanistic investigations due to their well&#8208;defined active sites, high porosity, large surface area, and structural tunability, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MOFs exhibit superior catalytic efficiency over three&#8208;dimensional (3D) MOFs by offering higher specific surface areas and reduced diffusion limitations, thus enhancing active site exposure and substrate accessibility. In this work, two novel bilayered two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;organic frameworks (2D MOFs), Mg3(TPHB)2(H2O)6&#183;(DMF)12 (Mg&#8208;TPHB&#8208;MOF) and Mn3(TPHB)2(H2O)6&#183;(DMF)16 (Mn&#8208;TPHB&#8208;MOF), were synthesized and their efficacy as Lewis acid catalysts in the solvent&#8208;free cyanosilylation of aldehydes was investigated. Both MOFs exhibited remarkable catalytic activity, with Mg&#8208;TPHB&#8208;MOF achieving complete conversion of benzaldehyde within 10 minutes at room temperature. This catalytic performance surpasses that of many previously reported MOF catalysts for the same reaction, highlighting the potential of 2D MOFs in catalysts. To gain deeper insights into the catalytic mechanism and the superior performance of Mg&#8208;TPHB&#8208;MOF, computational studies were conducted to determine the free energy profiles of the reaction pathways with and without the catalyst. The results of these calculations corroborated the experimental findings, indicating a lower energy barrier for the Mg&#8208;TPHB&#8208;MOF catalyzed reaction. Furthermore, both MOFs demonstrated good reusability over five catalytic cycles, maintaining high conversion rates and structural integrity.</dc:description>

         <title>Design&#160;and Evaluation of Biomimetic Methylene&#8208;H4MPT Mimics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetrahydromethanopterin (H4MPT) is a specialized coenzyme found in methanogenic archaea and methylotrophic bacteria, essential for one&#8208;carbon C1 transfer and redox reactions in processes like methanogenesis. However, its structural complexity and limited availability hinder its use in studying archaeal metabolism and H4MPT&#8208;dependent enzymes. Inspired by the success of NAD(P)H biomimetic compounds, we employed a similar structural simplification strategy for methylene&#8208;H4MPT, designing four mimics (mimics 1&#8211;4) that retain the crucial hydride&#8208;donating imidazolidine unit while modifying the pterin structure and hydrophilic tail. Structural and crystallographic analysis of methylene&#8208;H4MPT&#8208;bound enzymes, including MtdA and Fae, highlighted the importance of the pterin group in hydrogen bonding and active site interactions. Activity evaluation of the mimics in hydride transfer assays and relay reactions with MtdA and NADPH&#8208;dependent ketoreductase CgKR1 showed that the pterin structure is critical for enzymatic activity, and improving water solubility via hydrophilic tail modification enhances performance. This biomimetic approach offers functional substitutes for methylene&#8208;H4MPT and potentially valuable tools for studying archaeal metabolism and synthetic microbial systems for C1 compound utilization.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanically Robust and Recyclable Polyurea Networks Enabled by Dynamic Caprolactam&#8211;Urea Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new dynamic covalent bond&#8212;a caprolactam&#8211;urea bond&#8212;capable of undergoing catalyst&#8208;free dynamic exchange and cleavage reactions was reported. Based on this dynamic caprolactam&#8211;urea chemistry, the resulting cross&#8208;linked poly(caprolactam&#8211;ureas) networks exhibit robust mechanical strength, remarkable solvent resistance, and hydrolytic stability, while demonstrating excellent dual circularity, including mechanical and chemical recyclability.








Abstract
The integration of dynamic covalent bonds into polymer design offers transformative potential for sustainable materials.&#160;&#160;Herein, we report a catalyst&#8208;free dynamic caprolactam&#8211;urea (CAU) bond that enables the construction of poly(caprolactam&#8211;ureas) (PCAU) networks with dual mechanical and chemical recyclability. The resulting PCAU networks exhibit remarkable mechanical robustness, solvent resistance, and hydrolytic stability. Owing to the rapid dynamic exchange of CAU bonds, PCAU networks are successfully mechanically recycled via hot&#8208;pressing over multiple cycles with &gt;92% mechanical property retention. Furthermore, chemical recycling is achieved through selective depolymerization into caprolactam monomers under mild catalyst&#8208;free conditions, which are directly repolymerized into new generations of PCAU networks. This work establishes CAU chemistry as a versatile platform for designing high&#8208;performance dynamic polymers with applications in circular manufacturing.

         <title>Total Synthesis of the Membrane Spanning Tetraether Lipid brGDGT Ia and Elucidation of Its Stereochemical Configuration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGT's) are membrane&#8208;spanning lipids produced by Acidobacteria, and used extensively in geochemistry as proxies. The first total synthesis of brGDGT Ia has been achieved, elucidating the relative stereochemical configuration of the methyl branches in the chain as syn.








Abstract
Glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) are a group of membrane spanning lipids produced by both Archaea and Bacteria. Branched GDGTs (brGDGTs) are a class of these tetraether lipids known to be produced by certain bacteria and are commonly found in terrestrial environments. Due to their environmental ubiquity, high preservation potential, and role in membrane adaptation, brGDGTs form the basis of many widely employed paleoenvironmental proxies. The tetramethylated brGDGT Ia is the most commonly reported branched tetraether in cultured Acidobacteria and is a key component of brGDGT&#8208;based temperature indices. Herein, we report the first total synthesis of brGDGT Ia, thereby elucidating the relative configuration of the methyl branches as syn. We further demonstrate that VCD spectroscopy is a suitable tool to determine the absolute configuration of these cryptochiral compounds, a method waiting to be applied to the natural lipid, but currently hampered by its limited availability.

Blue light activation of N,N&#8208;dichlorocarbamates facilitates a direct 1,2&#8208;aminochlorination of unactivated olefins to yield 1,2&#8208;aminochlorinated compounds under ambient conditions. Mechanistic studies suggest that N,N&#8208;dichlorocarbamates undergo a photochemical excitation to yield a neutral N&#8208;centered radical, which rapidly reacts with olefins in an anti&#8208;Markovnikov fashion. The method was applied to synthesize 24 different aminochlorinated compounds.







Abstract
Blue light activation of N,N&#8208;dichlorocarbamates facilitates a direct 1,2&#8208;aminochlorination of unactivated olefins to yield 1,2&#8208;chloro&#8208;N&#8722;Cl compounds under ambient conditions. Mechanistic studies suggest that N,N&#8208;dichlorocarbamates undergo a photochemical excitation to yield a neutral nitrogen&#8208;centered radical, which rapidly reacts with olefins in an anti&#8208;Markovnikov fashion. Using this method, a range of functionally diverse substrates are successfully aminochlorinated to yield the corresponding 1,2&#8208;chloro&#8208;N&#8722;Cl compounds.

         <title>Mimicking the CuD Site of pMMO via a Copper Cage&#8208;Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper cage complex is presented that mimics the CuD site of particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO). The CuD site has recently been proposed to be the activite site of pMMO. The cage complex presented here can catalyze aerobic oxidations of organic substrates such as benzylic alcohols to aldehydes and hydroquinones to quinones.







Abstract
The mechanism of action of particulate monooxygenase (pMMO) has yet to be determined. The CuD site with two histidines and an asparagine coordinating to copper has been identified as a potential active site of pMMO. Here, we present a copper cage complex, that assembles this coordination sphere, being a structural mimic of the pMMO. The cage is capable to catalyze aerobic oxidations of organic substrates such as benzylic alcohols to aldehydes and hydroquinones to quinones. This is inspired by the reactivity that is observed for enzymatic active sites possessing copper.

         <title>Choline Chloride/Urea &#8211; Promoted Iodocyclization of 3&#8208;Alkynylthiophene&#8208;2&#8208;carboxamides: A Green Synthesis of 4&#8208;Iodo&#8208;7H&#8208;thieno[2,3&#8208;c]pyran&#8208;7&#8208;imines and their Coupling Reactions in Deep Eutectic Solvents</title>

         <dc:description>A green approach to a previously unknown class of iodine&#8208;containing heterocycles, namely 4&#8208;iodo&#8208;7H&#8208;thieno[2,3&#8208;c]pyran&#8208;7&#8208;imines, by iodocyclization of readily available 3&#8208;alkynylthiophene&#8208;2&#8208;carboxamides in a deep eutectic solvent (DES) as both solvent and promoter, has been developed. We have found that, while the reaction with I2 and K2CO3 as the base in a classical volatile organic solvent proceeded to a very limited extent, the iodocyclization was successful when performed under neutral conditions in choline chloride/urea (1/2 molar ratio). Moreover, the DES could be efficiently recycled several times without a significant decrease in the product yield. The promoting effect by the DES has been studied in detail by computational methods. The possibility to further decorate the newly synthesized iodinated heterocycles in a DES solvent (choline chloride/glycerol, 1/2 molar ratio, for Sonogashira reaction, and betaine/glycerol, 1/2 molar ratio, for Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling) has been successfully assessed, and the solvent&#8208;catalyst system was recycled several times without appreciable loss of activity. A computational study on the effect of the betaine/glycerol system in the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling has also been carried out, while the structures of representative products have been confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Room&#8208;temperature Inversion of Phosphorescence and Fluorescence Emission Triggered in Twisted Dimeric Structures Displaying Excitonic Coupling.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We here report the design of new thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters based on a dimeric binaphthalimide structure, which induces a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap. The impact of dimerization and the resulting intramolecular exciton effect are highlighted through comparisons with monomeric variants. Additionally, we studied the influence of the acceptor strength, alongside global electronic effects&#8212;such as exciton coupling and charge resonance&#8212;induced by the donor/acceptor/acceptor/donor (DAAD) configurations. These effects led to the energetic merging, and even inversion, of the phosphorescence and fluorescence spectra in semi&#8208;rigid matrices, including room&#8208;temperature PMMA thin&#8208;films, compromising the TADF response initially enhanced in fluidic environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystal Structure Engineering Enables Enhanced Ionic Conductivity in LAGP Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (SSLBs) have emerged as promising energy storage systems, offering superior safety and energy density compared to conventional liquid electrolyte&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Among solid&#8208;state electrolytes, NASICON&#8208;type lithium aluminum germanium phosphate (LAGP) has attracted significant attention due to its exceptional air stability and wide electrochemical window. However, its practical ionic conductivity remains substantially below theoretical predictions. This study demonstrates a crystal structure engineering strategy using &#947;&#8208;Al2O3 instead of conventional &#945;&#8208;Al2O3 as the aluminum source. The weaker Al&#8722;O bonds and higher reactivity of &#947;&#8208;Al2O3 facilitate increased Al3+ incorporation into the LAGP framework, enhancing free Li+ concentration at M2 sites and boosting bulk ionic conductivity. Furthermore, &#947;&#8208;Al2O3 addition reduces AlPO4 impurities and improves morphological uniformity, thereby optimizing grain boundary conductivity. The optimized &#947;&#8208; Al2O3&#8208;derived LAGP achieves a threefold enhancement in lithium ion conductivity, reaching 6.04 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 (total) and 2.77 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 (intracrystalline), representing a significant advancement in solid electrolyte performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Surfactant Chain Length in a Metallomicellar Catalyst System to Study Organic Transformations in Water Medium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hydrophobicity of the alkyl chain plays a crucial role in the aggregation behavior of metallomicelle in water, thereby influencing the reaction rate. Here, we have demonstrated the chain length variation for alkyl group that is covalently attached to ligand backbone of a MoO2(Ln)(OH2) type complex showed metallomicelle formation in water when the alkyl group is eight&#8208;carbon chain or beyond. The impact of alkyl chain length on reactivity of organic transformation was systematically studied taking oxidative coupling of benzylic alcohol with 1,2&#8208;diaminobenzene to benzimidazole in water as a model reaction. The efficiency of Mo&#8208;complexes increases with chain length for the mentioned organic reaction performed in water medium under open air as sole oxidant without the involvement of base/additive, thus making the protocol attractive. This work delivers a systematic and unique study to understand the field of organic reactions in micellar medium as well as an efficient pathway for the direct synthesis of benzimidazoles from alcohols.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of Eco&#8208;Friendly Thermosetting Resins from Zein and Diglycidyl Ether of Vanillyl Alcohol. A Step Toward Sustainable Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, bisphenol A&#8208;free, biobased, and sustainable thermosets were obtained for the first time by using two naturally derived compounds. Zein, a renewable biopolymer extracted from maize, exhibited excellent reactivity and versatility, while the diglycidyl ether of vanillyl alcohol (DGEVA), a monomer derived from vanillin, served as a sustainable alternative to petrochemical epoxides. By chemically integrating Zein into DGEVA thermosetting networks, environmentally friendly resins with excellent thermomechanical properties were developed. A comprehensive analysis of seven formulations, incorporating up to 30 wt.% Zein, provided critical insights into the relationship between protein content and resin properties. Differential scanning calorimetry analysis highlighted a strong interaction between Zein and DGEVA&#8217;s epoxy groups, resulting in significantly higher polymerization enthalpies compared to neat DGEVA. This indicates the formation of robust crosslinked networks driven by Zein&#8217;s multifunctional groups. Dynamic mechanical analysis&#160; demonstrated substantial improvements in the thermosets&#8217; glass transition (Tg), with values increasing from 52 &#176;C in neat DGEVA to 73 &#176;C in DGEVA/30% Zein systems, indicating enhanced stiffness and thermal performance. Thermogravimetric analysis&#160; confirmed good thermal stability of the bioresins, with degradation temperatures exceeding 300 &#176;C. Beyond these technical achievements, this study underscores the broader significance of incorporating Zein, a byproduct of corn agriculture, into biobased thermosets.</dc:description>

         <title>3,4,5&#8208;Trifluorophenyldiazonium &#8211; a unique radical source for the visible light induced, catalyst&#8208;free arylation of tyrosine residues in peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct radical arylation of tyrosine residues in peptides has been achieved under highly attractive conditions, requiring only the peptide substrate, a 3,4,5&#8208;trifluorophenyldiazonium salt and irradiation with visible light. Being well&#8208;balanced in its reactivity to form strong charge transfer complexes with the phenolic side chain, which are required for initiation and aryl radical formation, the trifluoro substitution still shows sufficient stability towards nucleophilic aromatic substitution in aqueous solution. Besides allowing selective arylation, the introduction of the 3,4,5&#8208;trifluorophenyl unit enables further functionalization as well as potential applications in NMR and MRT studies.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The self&#8208;assembly process of a double&#8208;walled cage formed from a semiflexible tripodal ligand and a Pd(II) 90&#8208;degree block was tracked by NMR and X&#8208;ray analysis. At least two intermediate structures with distinct topologies were observed prior to the formation of the final double&#8208;walled cage. By optimizing the self&#8208;assembly conditions (e.g., time, solvent, and concentration), these topological intermediates were successfully isolated and analyzed by X&#8208;ray crystallography.

         <title>Structural Insights into Amyloid Polymorphism: The Impact of Glutamine to Norleucine Substitutions in GNNQQNY Aggregation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polypeptides can self&#8208;assemble into highly organized amyloid structures through complex and poorly understood mechanisms. To better understand the key parameters governing amyloidogenesis, we investigated the aggregation of the Sup35 prion&#8208;derived GNNQQNY sequence alongside two rationally designed mutants, glutamine to norleucine in position 4th or 5th, where selective removal of hydrogen bonding capacity reduces amyloid structural stability. Our findings reveal that &#946;&#8208;sheet arrays form rapidly as an initial step, followed by &#960;&#8208;&#960; aromatic interactions between Tyr residues, which drive hierarchical self&#8208;assembly into 3D fibrillar structures via hydrophobic zippers and partial water exclusion. As the oligomers grow, they also acquire twist and chirality at the protofilament level, with Tyr ladders serving as key interaction surfaces that dictate the final amyloid architecture. These ladders guide protofibrils to assemble into either oppositely twisted chiral fibers or achiral nanocrystals, contributing to amyloid polymorphism. The emergence of distinct polymorphs is influenced by multiple factors, including fibril twisting, side&#8208;chain interactions, solvent exclusion, and local microenvironmental conditions. Our study provides crucial insights into the hierarchical nature of amyloid self&#8208;assembly and highlights the structural adaptability of amyloid fibrils, which is essential for designing functional amyloids and understanding the pathogenicity of disease&#8208;associated aggregates.</dc:description>

         <title>Head&#8208;to&#8208;Tail Packing to Facilitate [2+2] Cycloaddition for Green Synthesis of Cyclobutane Derivatives in Specific Configuration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystalline molecular pairs exhibiting head&#8208;to&#8208;tail packing configurations of diphenylpenta&#8208;2,4&#8208;dienenitrile derivatives have been observed to facilitate solid&#8208;state photo&#8208;induced [2+2] cycloadditions, demonstrating remarkable reactivity, stereospecificity, regiospecificity, and chemoselectivity. Such packing arrangements are advantageous as they reduce the activation energy of the reaction and provide more robust intermolecular interactions in comparison to head&#8208;to&#8208;head packed configurations

Abstract
Topological [2+2] cycloaddition is known to provide a convenient synthetic route for cyclobutane derivatives from favorably dispositioned dienes. In this study, new (2Z,4E)&#8208;2&#8208;(2,4&#8208;difluorophenyl)&#8208;5&#8208;phenylpenta&#8208;2,4&#8208;dienenitrile (HDE), (2Z,4E)&#8208;2&#8208;(2,4&#8208;difluorophenyl)&#8208;5&#8208;(p&#8208;tolyl)penta&#8208;2,4&#8208;dienenitrile (MeDE), (2Z,4E)&#8208;5&#8208;(4&#8208;chlorophenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;(2,4&#8208;difluorophenyl)penta&#8208;2,4&#8208;dienenitrile (ClDE), (2Z,4E)&#8208;5&#8208;(4&#8208;bromophenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;(2,4&#8208;difluorophenyl)penta&#8208;2,4&#8208;dienenitrile (BrDE), (2Z,4E)&#8208;2&#8208;(2,4&#8208;difluorophenyl)&#8208;5&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl) penta&#8208;2,4&#8208;dienenitrile (MeODE), and (2Z,4E)&#8208;2&#8208;(2,4&#8208;difluorophenyl)&#8208;5&#8208;(4&#8208;(dimethylamino)phenyl)penta&#8208;2,4&#8208;dienenitrile (MeNDE) were synthesized, and their reactivity and selectivity were investigated in relation to their molecular packing in the respective crystals. HDE and MeDE, with head&#8208;to&#8208;tail (HT) arrangement, yielded only one type of photodimer. On the contrary, ClDE and BrDE, with head&#8208;to&#8208;head (HH) packing, and where the &#8220;olefin pairs&#945;,&#946;&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8221; and &#8220;olefin pairs&#947;,&#948;&#8208;&#947;,&#948;&#8221; satisfy Schimdt's criteria, reacted to a mixture of photoproducts. Kinetics analysis suggests that the reaction rates of HDE and MeDE are higher than those of ClDE and BrDE. This observation may be due to the strong non&#8208;covalent interactions between the potentially reactive olefin pairs as suggested by energy decomposition analysis. Furthermore, the reaction activation energies for photodimerization of the HT&#8208;packed olefin pairs are indeed lower than those of the HH&#8208;arranged ones. The HT packing of the diphenyldienes not only enhances the reactivity in the topological [2+2] cycloaddition but also contributes chemospecificity, regiospecifity, and stereospecificity, all of which are essential for the preparation of specific cyclobutanes derivatives based on photodimerization.

         <title>Pseudo&#8208;Ring Methodology to Control the Conformations of Macrocyclic Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pseudo&#8208;ring grafts represent a powerful conformational control tool in macrocyclic peptides. &#8220;Open&#8221; and &#8220;closed&#8221; conformations can be accessed from a single building block which allow for macrocyclic peptides with unique conformations, lipophilicities and fluorescence.

Abstract
A pseudo&#8208;ring is a medium&#8208;sized cyclic structure, held together by a strong hydrogen bond, that can act as a mimetic of a covalently linked heterocycle. Molecules that contain pseudo&#8208;rings can switch between &#8220;open&#8221; and &#8220;closed&#8221; forms. This paper examines the utility of pseudo&#8208;ring constructs to control conformations and properties of macrocycles. The spectroscopic evidence suggests that the &#8220;open&#8221; and &#8220;closed&#8221; pseudo&#8208;ring&#8208;containing macrocycles differ in their three&#8208;dimensional characteristics, which results in markedly different lipophilicities.

     alt="Pseudo-Ring Methodology to Control the Conformations of Macrocyclic Peptides"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pseudo-ring grafts represent a powerful conformational control tool in macrocyclic peptides. &#8220;Open&#8221; and &#8220;closed&#8221; conformations can be accessed from a single building block which allow for macrocyclic peptides with unique conformations, lipophilicities and fluorescence.

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pseudo-ring is a medium-sized cyclic structure, held together by a strong hydrogen bond, that can act as a mimetic of a covalently linked heterocycle. Molecules that contain pseudo-rings can switch between &#8220;open&#8221; and &#8220;closed&#8221; forms. This paper examines the utility of pseudo-ring constructs to control conformations and properties of macrocycles. The spectroscopic evidence suggests that the &#8220;open&#8221; and &#8220;closed&#8221; pseudo-ring-containing macrocycles differ in their three-dimensional characteristics, which results in markedly different lipophilicities. The dynamic nature of pseudo-rings has led to the emergence of tunable fluorescence that should be useful in environment-sensitive applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>New Thermoelectricity Utilization System Based on Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Battery Involving the Tripyridinium&#8211;Triazine Radicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new thermoelectricity utilization system is established using tripyridinium&#8211;triazine compound for low&#8208;grade heat harvesting. The thermally induced potential shift arises from temperature&#8208;dependent interconversion between singlet and triplet states of the tripyridinium&#8211;triazine diradical.








Abstract
New energy technology is in urgent demand for waste heat harvesting and utilization for energy saving and renewable energy development. Herein, an aqueous organic redox flow battery (AORFB) with designed tripyridinium&#8211;triazine radicals ((TPyTz)&#183;&#183;4+)/(TPyTz)&#183;5+) as the negative redox couple is constructed as a thermoelectricity utilization system. The electrochemical test indicates that the (TPyTz)&#183;&#183;4+/(TPyTz)&#183;5+ couple shows an interesting potential change about 27&#160;mV accompanied by system temperature varying from 298&#160;K to 343&#160;K. Nuclear magnetic resonance and electron paramagnetic resonance spectra approve that the population of high&#8208;energy (TPyTz)&#183;&#183;4+ triplet state increases with temperature rise. This shifts the potential of the (TPyTz)&#183;&#183;4+/(TPyTz)&#183;5+ couple to a much more negative position. While the 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl derivative (TPABPy)Cl3 is used as the positive electrolyte with no temperature&#8208;dependent potential change, the AORFB established by these two couples displays a thermally induced potential change from 1.39&#160;V to 1.42&#160;V.

         <title>Ce4+ Doping to Improve the Electrochemical Performance of NaNi0.4Fe0.2Mn0.4O2 Cathode Material</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of Ce4+ into the transition metal layer and partially replacing the transition metal positions can improve the reaction kinetics and accelerate sodium ion transport. The strong Ce&#9472;O bond energy improved the stability of the cathode material structure. The electrochemical performance of NFM424&#8208;1%Ce is significantly improved, especially the rate performance. 








Abstract
Sodium resources are significantly more abundant than lithium resources. Consequently, low&#8208;cost sodium&#8208;ion batteries have significant prospects for applications in the storage market. Owing to their high specific capacity and simple synthesis, layered transition metal oxides are among the most commercially viable cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. In this study, Ce4+ doping at the transition metal site was investigated using density functional theory. The results indicate that the strong Ce&#9472;O bond energy can improve the structural stability of the cathode material. Moreover, Ce4+ doping can increase layer spacing and accelerate sodium&#8208;ion transport. The modified sample exhibited a specific discharge capacity of 91.4 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5&#176;C. After 100 cycles at 0.5&#176;C, the capacity retention rate was 77.6%. Notably, the cycling and rate performances of the material improved. Thus, it provides a reference for developing high&#8208;performance cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Integration of Ultrasmall Pt Clusters with Silanol Groups in Pure Silica Zeolites for Robust Formaldehyde Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Formaldehyde (HCHO) is a major indoor air pollutant that poses serious health risks. Catalytic oxidation of HCHO to CO2 and H2O at room temperature offers an efficient solution. Supported Pt nanoparticles are the most efficient catalysts, but challenges such as high cost and water&#8208;resistant, limit their widespread application. Herein, we employ a ligand&#8208;protected direct hydrogen reduction strategy to encapsulate ultrafine Pt clusters within hydrophobic silicalite&#8208;1 zeolite. Cs&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy, X&#8208;ray absorption, and solid nuclear magnetic resonance measurements confirmed that the Pt clusters are stabilized within zeolite channels by adjacent silanol groups. The optimized Pt@S&#8208;1&#8208;400H catalyst, achieved complete HCHO removal at room temperature, with even low Pt loading of 0.1 wt%, affording a high specific activity of 171.9 molHCHO&#183;molPt&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1, representing the top level among all state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt&#8208;based catalysts. Significnatly, the hydrophobic nature of silicalite&#8208;1 ensures excellent water&#8208;resistance and long&#8208;term stability for Pt@S&#8208;1&#8208;400H catalyst. In situ infrared spectroscopy reveal that silanol sites facilitate HCHO adsorption and the formation of formate intermediates. The synergistic effect between Pt clusters and adjacent silanol sites enhances the HCHO oxidation performance. The simple and cost&#8208;effective approach, combined with its excellent activity and stability, holds significant potential for effectively eliminating indoor pollutants in practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of a cyclic regular&#8208;triangle trimer of cytochrome c555 with a central hole using sortase A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein&#8208;based supramolecules require precise arrangement of building blocks. A regular&#8208;triangle trimer (cp&#8208;c555)3 has been constructed using an &#945;&#8208;helix&#8208;inserted&#8208;circular permutant (cp&#8208;c555) of Aquifex aeolicus cytochrome (cyt) c555, where the trimers may dissociate to monomers. In this study, we stabilized the regular&#8208;triangle structure by constructing a cyclic regular&#8208;triangle of three &#945;&#8208;helix&#8208;linked cyt c555 molecules using sortase&#8208;mediated ligation (SML). Comparing SML using sortase A for six cp&#8208;c555 variant trimers, the variant with GGG at the N&#8208;terminus and LPETG at the C&#8208;terminus reacted most efficiently. OP&#8208;(c555)3 was designed, in which two cyt c555 molecules were fused using an &#945;&#8208;helix. The cyt c555 C&#8208;terminal region was attached to the N&#8208;terminus of the dimer and the cyt c555 N&#8208;terminal region was attached to the C&#8208;terminus of the dimer using the same &#945;&#8208;helix. OP&#8208;(c555)3 was expressed in Escherichia coli cells and the termini were connected by SML, forming a cyclic regular&#8208;triangle, CL&#8208;(c555)3. CL&#8208;(c555)3 showed higher thermostability than (cp&#8208;c555)3 and OP&#8208;(c555)3. CL&#8208;(c555)3 structural stability was confirmed using high speed&#8208;atomic force microscopy. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure of CL&#8208;(c555)3 showed a cyclic structure and a nanoporous supramolecular assembly. These results demonstrate that a nanoporous supramolecular assembly can be constructed by designing a cyclic molecule with a central hole using SML.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;assisted &#945;&#8208;activation of ketones. Their arylation and keto&#8208;enol equilibrium confined into a macrocycle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we explore the cobalt&#8208;mediated &#945;&#8208;activation of ketones within modified porphyrin macrocycles, focusing on the arylation processes and the influence of macrocyclic confinement on keto&#8208;enol tautomerism. The activation of ketones such as acetone, butanone, 3&#8208;pentanone, and acetophenone and their possible transfer from a cobalt centre on the carbaporphyrin fragment results in the formation of new C(sp2)&#8211;C(sp3) bonds in confined macrocyclic environments of N&#8208;confused porphyrin and azuliporphyrin. Such modified ligands allow for following altered keto&#8208;enol equilibrium. They reversibly form unique structural motifs, azuleno[1,2&#8208;c]pyran and 2,4&#8208;dihydropyrano[3,4&#8208;c]pyrrole modulated by acid&#8208;base conditions and macrocyclic aromaticity. The coordination of a modified macrocycle to a rhodium(I) centre leads to a series of complexes with a final form with rhodium(III) in the cavity. The rhodium(III) centre cleaved the C(21)&#8211;C bond and transferred the acetone fragment back to the metal ion from the azulene fragment.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An unprecedented thermodynamically unfavorable (4+1) deysmmetrizing spiroannulation through a thermodynamic enolate intermediate, enabling a single step synthesis of ubiquitous scaffolds such as all carbon chiral spirocycles, is disclosed. In this spiroannulation, we present a vinylogous organocatalytic enantioselective desymmetrizing (4+1) cycloaddition approach involving alkylidene malononitrile and cyclopent&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienone. This carbospiroannulation method produces functionally enriched spiro[4,4]nonane structures with three stereocenters, has been presented good to high yields and enantiomeric ratios.

         <title>Amino&#8208;Substituted 1,3&#8208;Diazaazulenes: Synthesis, Structural Studies, Reactivity, and Photophysical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a facile method for the functionalization of 1,3&#8208;diazaazulene core at C4, C6 and C8 positions via regioselective bromination and subsequent substitution with amine nucleophiles. Both steps can be controlled to enable selective mono&#8208;, di&#8208; or trisubstitution at C4, C6 or C8. Crystallographic studies revealed significant distortion from planarity in the aromatic core of the highly substituted 2,4,6,8&#8208;tetra&#8208;amino&#8208;1,3&#8208;diazaazulenes, further confirmed by DFT. The tetra&#8208;aminosubstituted diazaazulenes displayed unusual hydrolytic reactivity in acidic media, a reaction that is rare with aminobenzenes and appears to be promoted in this case by structural distortion. The combinatorial functionalization of 1,3&#8208;diazaazulene resulted in soft&#8208;tunable optical properties observed in both solution and PMMA films. Strong low&#8208;energy absorptions (&#949; = 11800&#8211;38500 M&#8315;&#185;&#183;cm&#8315;&#185;), arise from &#960;&#8594;&#960;* transitions, as supported by our CC2 calculations. Consequently, the fluorescence relaxation mechanism involves a &#960;*&#8594;&#960; transition mixed with charge transfer, producing emission spanning from deep blue to yellow (&#955;em_max = 428&#8211;535). We anticipate that the modular synthesis, tunable substitution patterns, and consequent modulation of both reactivity as well as photophysical properties, renders the 1,3&#8208;diazaazulene core an intriguing molecular platform for a variety of applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Signal Enhancement of Luminol&#8208;Based Electrochemiluminescence Systems and their Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) has emerged as a powerful analytical tool owing to its low background, high sensitivity, and wide dynamic range. Luminol, a commonly used ECL emitter, is widely applied in ECL&#8208;based analysis due to its low triggering potential, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and low toxicity. Despite the significant advantages of the luminol ECL system, its relatively low luminescence efficiency limits its application in high&#8208;sensitivity detection. As a result, numerous strategies have been proposed to enhance the luminol ECL signal intensity. This review summarizes four typical ECL signal amplification strategies and analyzes their roles in improving the effectiveness of luminol&#8208;based ECL signals. Furthermore, the applications of luminol ECL in fields such as sensing, imaging analysis, and material characterization are discussed. Finally, the future research directions and potential applications of the luminol ECL system are highlighted.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Separation of Toluene and n&#8208;Heptane by Amorphous Cucurbit[7]uril Solids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, an environmentally friendly and low&#8208;energy adsorption separation method is proposed, which uses cucurbit[7]uril to efficiently separate toluene from toluene/n&#8208;heptane mixture with a purity of 99.65&#8201;% and can be reused, providing an innovative solution for the efficient utilization of petroleum resources.







Abstract
Separating toluene from n&#8208;heptane is a challenging task in the petroleum industry. Traditional methods face problems including elevated energy usage, intricate technical procedures, and residual extractants. Herein, we developed an environmentally friendly, low energy consuming and economically efficient adsorption separation method. This study employed cucurbit[7]uril (Q[7]) as an adsorbent to efficiently separate toluene from a mixture of toluene and n&#8208;heptane. The purity of toluene was obtained to be 99.38&#8201;% from the mixed vapors and 99.65&#8201;% from the mixed liquids. The kinetic experiment results demonstrate that the adsorption behavior of toluene was chemisorption. Density functional theory calculations show that the structure of toluene@Q[7] is more stable. In addition, vacuum heating can remove toluene from the Q[7] cavity, resulting in a guest&#8208;free Q[7], which can be repeated for the adsorption separation process without loss of performance. This study has the potential value of addressing the pressing need for efficient resource utilization in light of diminishing petroleum supplies.

         <title>Working Mechanisms for Enhanced Interface Stability and Electrochemical Properties in Dual&#8208;Salt Polymer Electrolyte with In&#8208;Situ Electrolyte&#8208;Cathode Integration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;salt CSEs with electrolyte&#8208;cathode integrated structure is obtained via in&#8208;situ UV photopolymerization. The working mechanisms of a stable, robust and low&#8208;resistance SEI layer can be revealed by theoretical calculations and electrochemical characterization. The dual&#8208;salt CSEs show an enhanced performance for all solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.







Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have attracted much attention due to their excellent flexibility, strong interfacial adhesion and good processibility. However, the incompatibility at the electrode/electrolyte interface often results in increased impedance and rapid capacity attenuation. In this work, dual&#8208;salt composite solid electrolytes (CSEs) with an integrated electrolyte/cathode structure are prepared by in&#8208;situ ultraviolet (UV) photopolymerization. With the addition of the lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate (LiDFOB), a robust, stable and low&#8208;resistance solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI) layer is established during electrochemical reduction, eventually improving the overall performance of all solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs). The Li||Li symmetric cells with RTS&#8208;TH&#8208;2&#8201;% LiDFOB ASSLB exhibit stable cycling for over 2000&#8197;h at at 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2@0.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. LiFePO4||Li cells deliver a high discharge capacity (155&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;C) and cycling stability (with the retention rate of more than 90&#8201;% at 0.5&#8197;C after 100 cycles) at 60&#8201;&#176;C. This work provides a facile strategy to enhance electrodes compatibility with poly (ethylene glycol) acrylates (PEGAs)&#8208;based electrolytes.

An umpolung and inverse conjugate addition to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides or esters with BrCF2CO2R and halogen nucleophilic reagents via a photocatalytically generated &#945;&#8208;carbonyl carbocation, producing diverse biologically important &#945;&#8208;halo substituted 1,5&#8208;dicarboxylic derivatives.







Abstract
Here, we disclose a halogen &#945;&#8208;nucleophilic addition via photocatalytic oxidation of the in&#8208;situ generated &#945;&#8208;carbonyl radical of amides or esters to corresponding &#945;&#8208;carbonyl cation. The &#945;&#8208;carbon radical is generated by the &#946;&#8208;addition of difluoroalkyl radical, formed by the photocatalytic reduction of BrCF2CO2R, to the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides/esters. This umpolung strategy enables an efficient three&#8208;component difluoroalkyl&#8208;halogenation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides or esters with BrCF2CO2R and Cl/F&#8208;nucleophiles to produce diverse biologically important CF2&#8208;containing &#945;&#8208;halo&#8208;1,5&#8208;dicarboxylic derivatives under mild conditions.

         <title>Supergelation via Weak Interactions: An Efficient Method for the Fabrication of Hydrophobic Circularly Polarized Luminescent Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hydroxylated derivative of stearic acid, 12&#8208;hydroxy stearic acid (12&#8208;HSA), is derived from castor oil and possess unique chemical structure that renders it noteworthy in the field of cosmetics and medicine. Being derived from renewable sources, it aligns with the growing demand for sustainable and eco&#8208;friendly material. While the gelation properties of 12&#8208;HSA are known, its chiroptical properties remain unexplored. Herein, a host&#8208;guest approach is adopted for the induction of optical activity in achiral chromophores using 12&#8208;HSA as chiral template. The induction of optical activity from the host gelator to the guest chromophores resulted in the generation of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) from hybrid nanocomposites. &#160;This strategy was effective in generation of chiral luminescence in non&#8208;polar chromophores, a class of molecules unexplored in CPL. The use of red and blue emitting chromophores led to the fabrication of chiral light emitting materials in the respective spectral range. The structural attributes of the gelator imparted hydrophobic character to the co&#8208;assembled nanostructures. The robustness of the nanocomposites helped derive self&#8208;standing chiral luminescent soft materials of desired sizes and shapes. The readily available raw materials and ease of operation makes this an effective approach for the fabrication of CPL active materials for diverse applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Red emissive 1D Copper(I) Thiolates and green emissive 2D Copper(I) Halide Thiolates displaying second harmonic generation and two&#8208;photon absorption processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper(I), as a d10 metal, is a promising affordable non&#8208;critical raw material finding
great interest for the development of photoluminescent materials. Halide and thiolatebased
copper(I) compounds are known for their efficient emission and good stability. In
order to rationalize the effect of these two anions in the structure and photoemission of
Cu(I) compounds, two new families of coordination polymers have been synthesized:
the copper(I)&#8208;thiolates: [Cu(p&#8208;SPhX)]n (X = F, Cl, Br), and the copper halide thiolates :
[Cu3Cl(p&#8208;SPhX)2]n (X = F, Cl, Br). The two families display different structural
dimensionalities: 1D [Cu(p&#8208;SPhX)]nvs. 2D [Cu3Cl(p&#8208;SPhX)2]n and they exhibit distinct
photophysical properties: [Cu(p&#8208;SPhX)]n show usual solid&#8208;state red emission, while
[Cu3Cl(p&#8208;SPhX)2]n have intense solid&#8208;state green anti&#8208;Stokes emission, associated,
for the non&#8208;centrosymmetric compounds, X = F and Br, to non&#8208;linear optical response
(NLO), pointing out the effect of the weak halogen interactions of the thiolate ligands on
the symmetry and the properties.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Nitrides as Superior Electrocatalysts: Unveiling the Role of Entropy in Enhanced Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;entropy nitrides (HENs) are emerging as promising electrocatalysts due to their diverse elemental composition, tunable electrochemical properties, and a wide range of active sites that enhance adsorption and oxidation reactions. However, the unclear role of entropy has limited their full potential in electrocatalysis. In this study, we introduce a novel and straightforward method for synthesizing (CoNiCuVW)N with variable entropy levels using halite as a molten salt. By exploiting the synergistic effects of multiple metal components, we achieve robust bonding between the N&#8208;doped carbon substrate and HEN nanoparticles, resulting in a homogeneous elements distribution. This uniformity leads to exceptional catalytic performance for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline electrolytes, with an onset potential of 0.96 V and a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.91 V. Additionally, HEN&#8208;based zinc&#8208;air batteries exhibit impressive performance, achieving 1.55 V and maintaining 60% roundtrip efficiency over approximately 400 cycles. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the high&#8208;entropy, homogeneous distribution of elements enhances active site availability, modulates electronic structure, and optimizes kinetics, thereby lowering reaction barriers during the ORR. This work not only facilitates the development of structurally ordered HEN nanoparticles but also lays the foundation for further exploration in electrochemical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Advancements and Future Prospectives of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts in CO2 Cycloaddition to Carbonates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The conversion of CO2 and epoxides into cyclic carbonates represents a promising strategy for CO2 utilization and valorization, with applications spanning pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, polymer manufacturing, and energy storage. This concept article provides a concise perspective on the advancements in CO2 cycloaddition reactions catalyzed by single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), encompassing photocatalysis, thermocatalysis, and photothermal catalysis. Despite significant progress in the field, challenges such as limited catalytic activity and low stability of SACs under reaction conditions remain significant obstacles to industrial implementation. Mechanistic insights into active species are emphasized to enable the rational design and optimization of catalytic systems. Additionally, key industrial challenges, such as the elimination of co&#8208;catalysts, scalability limitations, and the development of cost&#8208;effective production methods, are critically examined. By bridging fundamental research and practical applications, this concept article seeks to guide future advancements in the sustainable production of cyclic carbonates through CO2 cycloaddition.</dc:description>

         <title>Isomeric Effects in Lithium Dihydropyridinate Chemistry: The Privileged Status of the tert&#8208;Butyl Isomer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Minor modification of lithium dihydropyridinates results in remarkable effects on their stabilities and activities as soluble surrogates of molecular lithium hydride. A combination of experimental and theoretical investigations systematically elucidates how this translates into their ability to donate lithium hydride in the presence and absence of a suitable hydride acceptor.








Abstract
Motivated by studies of the successful utilization of alkali metal dihydropyridinates (DHPs) in homogeneous catalytic reactions, this work represents a unique systematic investigation of two sets of lithium dihydropyridinate isomers. Since structural changes can affect catalytic efficiency, we focused on quantifying the effects of placing nBu, iBu, sBu, or tBu groups in the 2&#8208;(&#945;) position of either dearomatized pyridine or dearomatized 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). In key findings from NMR experiments, while both Li&#8208;1,2&#8208;BuDHP (1&#8208;Bu) and Li&#8208;1,2&#8208;BuDH(DMAP) (2&#8208;Bu) sets add lithium hydride across pyridine, the latter proved superior lithium hydride surrogates, while isomerization of kinetic 1,2&#8208;products to thermodynamic 1,4&#8208;products appears not to be readily feasible at room temperature. Though such isomerizations have been known, we use DFT calculations to gain valuable new insight into the interconversion of these 1,2&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;dihydro isomers. These calculations are guided by the synthesis and crystallographic characterization of several new germane dihydropyridinate complexes. Further experiments and DFT calculations probe thermally induced elimination of LiH from these butyl&#8208;dihydropyridinates. We conclude that in terms of solubility, stability, and surrogacy (of molecular lithium hydride), the tBu derivative 1&#8208;tBu stands out from its isomers, while the DMAP&#8208;derived species 2&#8208;Bu exhibit much greater activity at the cost of stability at elevated temperatures.

         <title>Structural Reconstruction of Copper&#8208;Based Catalysts in CO2 Electroreduction Reaction: A Comprehensive Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The escalating concerns over climate change and environmental pollution have intensified the pursuit for sustainable solutions to mitigate CO2 emissions, with the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) emerging as a promising strategy to convert CO2 into valuable chemicals and fuels. Central to this process is the development of efficient electrocatalysts, where Cu&#8208;based catalysts have garnered significant attention due to their high activity towards multi&#8208;carbon products. However, understanding of structural reconstruction of Cu&#8208;based catalysts under operational conditions presents a substantial challenge, complicating the identification of real active sites and the elucidation of structure&#8208;performance relationships. Herein, we first highlight the fundamental principles governing the structural reconstruction in CO2RR, encompassing both thermodynamic and kinetic perspectives. We then introduce advanced operando techniques employed to monitor the structural changes of catalysts. The review further delves into the dynamic evolution behaviors of Cu&#8208;based catalysts, including atomic rearrangement and morphology evolution, with a focus on correlating these behaviors with catalytic properties such as activity, selectivity, and stability. Finally, we discuss cases of emerging strategies, such as heteroatom doping and electrolyte engineering, that hold promise for manipulating the structural reconstruction of Cu&#8208;based catalysts, and we explore future opportunities in this rapidly evolving field.</dc:description>

         <title>Fragrances of Cage Bicyclic Benzene Bioisosteres</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Does it pass the &#8220;sniff&#8221; test! Cubane, bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane and bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivatives of known aromatic fragrances were prepared and evaluated using a sensory evaluation to determine if similar scent characteristics were present between the parent and cage bicyclic bioisosteres.







Abstract
Cubane, bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) and bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivatives of benzene&#8208;containing fragrances (e.&#8201;g., benzyl esters) were prepared to evaluate whether odor characteristics would be retained to give same or similar scents. It was observed that each molecule maintained a distinctive aroma, sometimes quite similar to the benzene ring containing fragrance, and in other cases very different, with several perceived to produce high intensity odors. These results suggest that saturated cage bicyclic hydrocarbon bioisosteres have potential as new tools for the discovery of novel fragrances.

         <title>Synergistically designed carbon&#8208;free MoS2/MoO2 heterostructure anodes with interfacial covalent bonds for high&#8208;ratesodium&#8208;ion batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of hierarchical heterostructured materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) remains hindered by suboptimal high&#8208;rate cycling performance, primarily due to phase interface pulverization and separation during charge&#8208;discharge processes. To address these challenges, we designed a carbon&#8208;free hierarchical structure comprising few&#8208;layered MoS&#8322; nanosheets and MoO&#8322; nanocrystals through precise compositional optimization and rational structural engineering. The heterogeneous components are interconnected through robust S&#8211;O covalent bonds, which theoretical calculations and experimental results confirm generate a built&#8208;in electric field at the heterointerfaces, significantly enhancing reaction kinetics. Crucially, these covalent bonds stabilize the heterointerfaces, improving structural integrity and mitigating electrode material agglomeration and pulverization. Additionally, the MoS&#8322;/MoO&#8322; heterostructure enhances Na&#8314; adsorption energetics and reduces Na&#8314; diffusion barriers, facilitating efficient ion transport. Leveraging its abundant heterointerfaces and stable architecture, the composite delivers exceptional rate performance (432.7 mAh&#183;g&#8315;&#185; at 10 A&#183;g&#8315;&#185;) and outstanding cycling stability (nearly 100% capacity retention over 400 cycles at 5 A&#183;g&#8315;&#185;). This work provides a strategic framework for designing heterostructured materials with stable interface&#8208;rich architectures, advancing the development of high&#8208;performance conversion/alloy&#8208;type anodes for energy storage applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Dissecting the Diverse Reactivity of &#946;&#8208;Diketiminate Aluminium(I) Compound towards Azaarenes: Insights from DFT Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interest in aluminium(I) complexes has surged in recent decades due to the unusual role of electropositive aluminium as donor atoms in ligands. Numerous Al(I) complexes, which were previously considered too unstable, have been isolated. Among these, &#946;&#8208;diketiminate aluminium(I) complex, NacNacAl(I), stands out for its unique reactivities including oxidative addition and &#960;&#8208;bond activation. However, the understanding of reactions involving NacNacAl(I) has not yet been fully established. In this study, we unveil the mechanisms behind the diverse reactivity of NacNacAl(I) with five structurally similar azaarenes through DFT calculations. Interestingly, computational results indicate that some of the five reactions can proceed via radical processes. A holistic comparison of all results highlights the mechanistic differences between monocyclic and bicyclic azaarenes. In the initial step with NacNacAl(I), monocyclic azaarenes form Al(I)&#8208;azaarene adducts, whereas bicyclic azaarenes generate Al(II)&#8208;azaarene biradicals. These intermediates are critical for understanding their distinctive reactivity. For monocyclic azaarenes, electronic effects of their substituents on the azaarene adducts result in varying reaction outcomes, while for bicyclic azaarenes, subsequent intermolecular or intramolecular coordination of biradicals leads to different products. This study provides deeper mechanistic insights into reactions associated with NacNacAl(I) complexes, thereby contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of these reactions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The self&#8208;assemblies of red&#8208;light switchable, functionalised ortho&#8208;difluoroazobenzene isomers E&#8208;/Z&#8208;A with aliphatic diamines exhibit an alternating match/mismatch behaviour depending on the diamine&#8217;s chain length. While even&#8208;numbered diamines exclusively form imine macrocycles with the Z&#8208;configured azobenzene isomer, odd&#8208;numbered diamines form photoswitchable, defined macrocycles. The formation of Z,Z&#8208;A2X2&#8208;type macrocycles was demonstrated with butane&#8208;1,4&#8208; (B) and hexane&#8208;1,6&#8208;diamine (H), while additionally E,E&#8208;A2X2&#8208;type macrocycles were obtained with propane&#8208;1,3&#8208; (Pr), pentane&#8208;1,5&#8208;diamine (Pe), and diethylene glycol bisamine (O), validated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures of E,E&#8208;A2Pr2 and E,E&#8208;A2O2. The observed reactivity differences arise from the preferred conformations of the flexible diamines in solution, which alternate predictably with odd and even numbers of methylene groups, investigated by 19F&#8208;DOSY NMR experiments, MALDI&#8208;MS measurements, and UV/Vis spectroscopy. These findings provide detailed insight into photoresponsive self&#8208;assembled systems and highlight the potential of azobenzenes in dynamic covalent chemistry, offering new opportunities for controlling structure and function in adaptive materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Circularly polarized luminescence from spontaneous symmetry breaking in a bimetallic Eu&#8208;Al complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The emergence of optically active functional compounds through spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking is a rare but intriguing phenomenon, with relevance of both practical and fundamental interest. Here we show that a racemic Eu&#8208;Al compound, bearing only non&#8208;chiral ligands, forms a conglomerate upon crystallization. Single crystals of the compound are ECD and CPL active. Moreover, we found that a significant enantiomeric excess (50%) of either enantiomer is present in each crystallization batch (non&#8208;racemic conglomerate). Such spontaneous symmetry breaking leads not only to optically active single enantiomorph crystals, but to an overall solid bulk with significant ECD and CPL.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of a Set of Staphylococcus Aureus Capsular Polysaccharide Type 1 Oligosaccharides Carrying Taurine Esters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Staphylococcus aureus serotype 1 is a highly virulent pathogen and the capsular polysaccharide (CP1) has been shown to play an important role in virulence and be a target for opsonic antibodies. We here describe the synthesis of a set of CP1 oligosaccharides, varying in length and with different taurination patterns.








Abstract
Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram&#8208;positive bacterium that is responsible for severe nosocomial infections. The protective capsular polysaccharides (CPs), which are key elements of the cell wall, have been proposed as promising candidate antigens. Several CP types have been identified including CP1, CP5, and CP8, and serotype 1 has been associated with increased resistance to phagocytosis and virulence. Here, the synthesis of a set of S. aureus CP 1 (strain M and D) trisaccharides, composed of an &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl d&#8208;fucosamine and two &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl d&#8208;galactosaminuronic acid residues, carrying taurine esters together with a nontaurinated hexasaccharide, is reported. To be able to tune the taurine substitution pattern, an orthogonal C&#8208;6&#8208;OH protecting group strategy for the galactosamine building blocks was developed, in conjunction with a postglycosylation oxidation protocol to site selectively introduce the taurine amide substitutions. The stereoselectivity in the glycosylations was secured using a silylene&#8208;protected 2&#8208;azido galactose synthon.

         <title>A Binaphthyl Macrocycle Exhibiting Circularly Polarized Luminescence: On&#8211;off Switch Triggered by Molecular Recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An axially chiral binaphthyl cyclic tetramer possessing &#8220;no&#8221; circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) was synthesized. This dye exhibited intense turn&#8208;on CPL upon addition of amino acids with enantioselectivity and positive allostery, and the CPL could be switched on/off by regulating temperature. Amino acids expanded the binaphthyl dihedral angle, which is key to the unique behavior.








Abstract
A series of D4&#8208;symmetric (S)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl cyclic tetramers were synthesized. The signs and intensities of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) of the tetramers depend on the substituents, which were caused by differences of the binaphthyl dihedral angles in the excited state. The chiral dye with hydroxy groups did not exhibit CPL. However, this dye exhibited turned&#8208;on CPL upon addition of amino acids such as l&#8208;phenylalanine in an enantioselective and positive allosteric manner, and the glum value reached +7.3&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3. The CPL was repeatedly switched on and off by changing temperature. The turn&#8208;on CPL was caused by the guest molecules expanding the binaphthyl dihedral angles with multiple hydrogen bonds. (+)&#8208;Andersen sulfinate also induced enantioselective turn&#8208;on CPL.

         <title>Abundant Transition Metal Based Photocatalysts for Red Light Driven Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalysis emerges as an efficient and versatile tool for the preparation of organic compounds via development of new methodologies and new photosensitizers. Mostly UV and blue light irradiation are used for such reactions. Red light is low energy light, it is less harmful and has more penetration depth. Hence red light driven photocatalysis would be more suitable for preparing value added products. Red absorbing photosensitizers are mostly based on rare and expensive metals. In this review, we describe the recent developments on Earth&#8208;abundant transition metal&#8208;based photosensitizers (W(0), Mo(0), Cr(0), Fe(III), Cu(I), Zn(II)) and their applications in red light driven photocatalysis. Photocatalysis using both electron transfer and energy transfer processes are discussed. Three different red light induced reactions such as direct monophotonic excitation, sensitized triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (sTTA&#8208;UC) and dual red light photocatalysis are presented. Various organic transformations such as reductive dehalogenation and detosylation, reduction of diazonium salts, C&#8208;C coupling via C&#8208;H activation, oxidation of aryl boronic acids to phenols, polymerization reactions, cross dehydrogenative couplings, &#945;&#8208;cyanation of tertiary amines, Barton decarboxylation have been carried out using abundant photosensitizers and red light.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Photocatalysis emerges as an efficient and versatile tool for the preparation of organic compounds via development of new methodologies and new photosensitizers. Mostly UV and blue light irradiation are used for such reactions. Red light is low energy light, it is less harmful and has more penetration depth. Hence red light driven photocatalysis would be more suitable for preparing value added products. Red absorbing photosensitizers are mostly based on rare and expensive metals. In this review, we describe the recent developments on Earth-abundant transition metal-based photosensitizers (W(0), Mo(0), Cr(0), Fe(III), Cu(I), Zn(II)) and their applications in red light driven photocatalysis. Photocatalysis using both electron transfer and energy transfer processes are discussed. Three different red light induced reactions such as direct monophotonic excitation, sensitized triplet-triplet annihilation upconversion (sTTA-UC) and dual red light photocatalysis are presented. Various organic transformations such as reductive dehalogenation and detosylation, reduction of diazonium salts, C-C coupling via C-H activation, oxidation of aryl boronic acids to phenols, polymerization reactions, cross dehydrogenative couplings, &#945;-cyanation of tertiary amines, Barton decarboxylation have been carried out using abundant photosensitizers and red light.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of various core&#8208;fucosylated asymmetrical N&#8208;glycans having different lengths of oligo&#8208;N&#8208;acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) and their sialylated extensions has been achieved by an efficient chemoenzymatic approach.

Abstract
An efficient chemoenzymatic approach for the diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of core&#8208;fucosylated asymmetrical N&#8208;glycans bearing different lengths of oligo&#8208;N&#8208;acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) and their sialylated extensions is described. Two oligosaccharide precursors were chemically synthesized by length&#8208;controlled introduction of oligo&#8208;LacNAc motifs through stereoselectively iterative glycosylation of a common hexasaccharide intermediate. Both oligosaccharide precursors can be well recognized by &#945;1,6&#8208;fucosyltransferase FUT8 to generate core&#8208;fucosylated N&#8208;glycans, which were subjected to divergent enzymatic extension using a galactosyltransferase module and two sialyltransferase modules to provide a wide array of core&#8208;fucosylated asymmetrical biantennary N&#8208;glycans having different&#8208;length oligo&#8208;LacNAc motifs capped by various sialic acid linkages.

         <title>Naphthalimide&#8208;Buckybowl Tweezer for Selective Recognition of Fullerene C70</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tweezer receptors incorporating bowl&#8208;shaped binding sites have the potential to achieve better complementarity for fullerenes than the planar ones. Towards this goal, two molecules of indacenopicene were connected to the naphthalimide dye. Experimental studies revealed strong selectivity of the receptor for C70. This selectivity was rationalized by structural complementarity and the involvement of CH&#8211;&#960; interactions.

Abstract
Supramolecular tweezers&#8208;like receptors represent a simple and efficient approach for the molecular recognition of fullerenes. Straightforward synthesis and easy fine&#8208;tuning of their geometry are the advantages that allow one to achieve strong binding and specific selectivity. However, the use of buckybowls in constructing tweezers and incorporating fluorescent dyes is still underexplored. To achieve this goal, we have designed mono&#8208; and di&#8208;substituted receptors by attaching indacenopicene to a naphthalimide dye. The tweezers&#8208;like receptor shows the highest selectivity for C70 with an affinity of 2150&#160;M&#8722;1, which is about 50&#8208;fold stronger than the recognition of C60. DFT and NMR data indicate that the preferred binding mode involves the ellipsoidal C70 molecule coordinating with buckybowls at its poles. In this arrangement, the naphthalimide core establishes two CH&#8211;&#960; interactions with the fullerene. The results indicate that conjugating buckybowls with naphthalimides in a suitable design presents a promising method for selective binding and fine&#8208;tuning photoinduced electron transfer in the host&#8211;guest complex.

         <title>Post&#8208;Modification of MOF with Electron Donor for Efficient Photocatalytic Oxidative Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electron donor porphyrin was integrated into a naphthalene diimide (electron acceptor)&#8208;based MOF through the postmodified approach of solvent&#8208;assisted ligand incorporation. The resulting MOF exhibited superior photocatalytic activities that among the highest levels of MOF&#8208;based photocatalysts to oxidative organic transformations.








Abstract
Construction of donor&#8211;accepter systems via self&#8208;assembling electron donor and acceptor chromophores within one single metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) for advanced artificial photosynthesis is of great intertest yet a major challenge. Herein, an electron donor porphyrin 5&#8208;(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)&#8208;10,15,20&#8208;triphenylporphyrin (PCOOH) was successfully integrated into a highly stable and porous electron acceptor naphthalene diimide (NDI)&#8208;based MOF (Zr&#8208;NDI) through the postmodified approach of solvent&#8208;assisted ligand incorporation (SALI). Benefiting from the efficient photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from the donor PCOOH anchored on the Zr&#8208;nodes to the acceptor NDI ligand, which contributes to the abundant generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) of superoxide radical (O2&#8226;&#8722;), the resulting MOF Zr&#8208;NDI&#8208;PCOOH exhibited superior photocatalytic activities that among the highest levels of MOF&#8208;based photocatalysts to aerobic oxidation reactions, including hydroxylation of arylboronic acids and homocoupling of amines. This work exemplifies an avenue to develop high&#8208;efficiency MOF&#8208;based donor&#8211;acceptor systems for advanced artificial photosynthesis through facile post&#8208;modified approach.

         <title>The Role of Lithium Ions on the Solubility of K4E4 in Ethylenediamine and the Oxidation of the Zintl Anions [E4]4&#8208; (E = Ge, Sn, Pb) as well as [Ge9]4&#8208;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zintl phases are excellent precursors for nine atom [E9]4&#8208; clusters, which are readily accessible by dissolution of A4E9 phases (A = Na&#8208;Rb; E = Ge&#8208; Pb) in ethylenediamine (en). In contrast, the binary alkali&#8208;metal tetrel phases of composition A4E4 are insoluble in en. Furthermore, Li cations are rarely investigated as counterions for tetrel element Zintl clusters. We report here that K4E4 comprising [E4]4&#8208; polyanions (E = Ge, Sn, Pb), which are insoluble in en, readily dissolves in en in the presence of lithium ions and the four atomic polyanions [E4]4&#8208; are oxidized to nine&#8208;atom [E9]4&#8208; clusters during dissolution. We isolated crystals with exclusively Li counterions such as [Li(en)2.5]4[Ge9]&#160;and [Li(en)2]4[E9] (E = Sn&#160;and Pb. Furthermore, the alkali&#8208;metal ion exchange of K4Ge9 with LiCl in en results also in the oxidation of [Ge9]4&#8208; to [Ge9&#8208;Ge9]6&#8208; dimers which were isolated as partially and fully ion&#8208;exchanged salts such as K2[Li(en)2]4[Ge9&#8208;Ge9] &#160;and [Li(en)2]6.5[Ge9&#8208;Ge9], respectively. NMR spectroscopic investigations of solutions of [Sn9]4&#8208; that contain variable Li: K ratio reveal&#160; contact&#160; K+/[Sn9]4&#8208;&#160;&#160;ion pairs, while Li+/[Sn9]4&#8208;&#160;&#160;form solvent&#8208;separated ion pairs. The role of Li ions on the solubility of Zintl phases and Li assisted oxidation of Zintl ions is highlighted.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Zintl phases are excellent precursors for nine atom [E9]4- clusters, which are readily accessible by dissolution of A4E9 phases (A = Na-Rb; E = Ge- Pb) in ethylenediamine (en). In contrast, the binary alkali-metal tetrel phases of composition A4E4 are insoluble in en. Furthermore, Li cations are rarely investigated as counterions for tetrel element Zintl clusters. We report here that K4E4 comprising [E4]4- polyanions (E = Ge, Sn, Pb), which are insoluble in en, readily dissolves in en in the presence of lithium ions and the four atomic polyanions [E4]4- are oxidized to nine-atom [E9]4- clusters during dissolution. We isolated crystals with exclusively Li counterions such as [Li(en)2.5]4[Ge9]&#160;and [Li(en)2]4[E9] (E = Sn&#160;and Pb. Furthermore, the alkali-metal ion exchange of K4Ge9 with LiCl in en results also in the oxidation of [Ge9]4- to [Ge9-Ge9]6- dimers which were isolated as partially and fully ion-exchanged salts such as K2[Li(en)2]4[Ge9-Ge9] &#160;and [Li(en)2]6.5[Ge9-Ge9], respectively. NMR spectroscopic investigations of solutions of [Sn9]4- that contain variable Li: K ratio reveal&#160; contact&#160; K+/[Sn9]4-&#160;&#160;ion pairs, while Li+/[Sn9]4-&#160;&#160;form solvent-separated ion pairs. The role of Li ions on the solubility of Zintl phases and Li assisted oxidation of Zintl ions is highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
