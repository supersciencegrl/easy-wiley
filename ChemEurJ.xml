         <title>Teaching an old compound new tricks: reversible transamidation in maleamic acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic combinatorial chemistry is a method widely used for generating responsive libraries of compounds, with applications ranging from chemical biology to materials science. It relies on dynamic covalent bonds that are able to form in a reversible manner in mild conditions, and therefore requires the discovery of new types of these bonds in order to progress. Amides, due to their high stability, have been scarcely used in this eld

and typically require an external catalyst or harsh conditions for exchange. Compounds able to undergo uncatalysed transamidation at room temperature are still rare exceptions. In this work, we describe reversible amide formation and transamidation in a class of compounds known as maleamic acids. Due to the presence of a carboxylic acid in b&#8208;position, these compounds are in equilibrium with their anhydride and amine precursors in organic solvents at room temperature. First, we show that this equilibrium is responsive to external stimuli: by alternating the additions of a Br&#248;nsted acid and a base, we can switch between amide and anhydride several times without side&#8208;reactions. Next, we prove that this equilibrium provides a pathway for reversible transamidation without any added catalyst, leading to thermodynamic distributions of amides at room temperature. Lastly, we use dierent preparation conditions and concentrations of Br&#248;nsted acid to access dierent library distributions, easily controlling the transition between kinetic and thermodynamic regimes. Our results show that maleamic acids can undergo transamidation in mild conditions in a reversible and tunable way, establishing them as a new addition to the toolbox of dynamic combinatorial chemistry.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new class of electrophilic monofluoromethylselenolation reagents,  Se  &#8208;(fluoromethyl) benzenesulfonoselenoates, has been developed. They can be readily prepared from sodium benzenesulfinates, Se and ClCFH  2  in one step under mild reaction conditions.  Se  &#8208;(fluoromethyl) benzenesulfonoselenoates are efficient electrophilic monofluoromethylselenolation reagents for a wide range of nucleophiles including indole, 6&#8208;azaindole, pyrrole, thiophene, electron&#8208;rich arene, aryl boronic acid and alkyne. The monofluoromethylselenolation approach features mild and environmentally friendly reaction conditions, good tolerance of various functional groups, and broad substrate scope.</dc:description>

         <title>Binding of VIVO2+, VIVOL+, VIVOL2 and VVO2L moieties to proteins: X&#8208;ray/theoretical characterization and biological implications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vanadium compounds have been frequently proposed as therapeutics but their application has been hampered due to lack of information on the different V&#8208;containing species that may form and how these interact with blood and cell proteins, and enzymes. Here, we report several resolved crystal structures of lysozyme with bound V  IV  O  2+  and V  IV  OL, where L = 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine or 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (phen), and of trypsin with V  IV  O(picolinato)  2  and V  V  O  2  (phen) moieties. Computational studies complete the refinement and shed light on the relevant role of hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds and microsolvation in the structure stabilization. Noteworthy, the trypsin&#8208;V  V  O  2  (phen) and trypsin&#8208;V  IV  O(OH)(phen) adducts correspond to similar energies suggesting a possible interconversion under physiological/biological conditions. Obtained data support the relevance of hydrolysis of V  IV  &#8208; and V  V  &#8208;complexes in the several types of binding established with proteins and formation of different adducts that may contribute to their pharmacological action, and significantly widens the knowledge of vanadium&#8208;protein interactions  .</dc:description>

         <title>Multienzyme Biocatalytic Cascade Systems in Porous Organic Frameworks for Biosensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New strategies for spatially organizing multienzyme biocatalytic cascades using porous organic frameworks are discussed in this Concept article, describing how this new bio&#8208;nanosystem that integrates framework and enzyme functions can be designed as a versatile biosensing platform.







Abstract
Multienzyme biocatalytic cascade systems (MBCS) have attracted widespread research in the field of biosensing due to selective substrate transformations and signal amplification function. However, the poor stability of enzymes significantly restricts their effectiveness in practical applications. The spatial organization of MBCS within porous organic frameworks (POFs), such as metal&#8211;organic frameworks, covalent organic frameworks, and hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks, is regarded as a promising strategy to overcome these challenges. This advanced biotechnology sets up a POFs microenvironment for enzymes immobilization, and thus make it possible to shield the enzyme from the external stimulus by POFs&#8208;guided structural confinement. Simultaneously, the tailorable porous structure of POFs shell allows for the selective transport of substrates into interior enzymes, thereby accelerating the sensing process. Herein, we present the concept of this POFs&#8208;confined MBCS, wherein enzymes were completely encapsulated into, rather than adsorption onto, the POFs. We highlight the new strategies for MBCS spatial organization through rational POFs support, and describe how this new bio&#8208;nanosystem that integrates framework and enzymes functions can be designed as a versatile biosensing platform. In addition, the challenges and outlooks are also discussed.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Isolation of a Labile Silylated Hydrazinium&#8208;yl Radical Cation, [(Me3Si)2N&#8722;N(H)SiMe3].+</title>

Radical hydrazinium: A highly labile hydrazinium&#8208;yl radical cation, [(Me3Si)2N&#8722;N(H)SiMe3].+, formed by a one&#8208;electron oxidation of tris(trimethylsilyl) hydrazine, (Me3Si)2N&#8722;N(H)SiMe3, with silver salts is presented. The structural and electronic parameters of the hydrazinium&#8208;yl radical cation were elucidated, revealing that the spin density in the isolated radical is mainly localized along the N&#8722;N unit of the hydrazine moiety.







Abstract
The oxidation of silylated hydrazine, (Me3Si)2N&#8722;N(H)SiMe3, with silver salts led to the formation of a highly labile hydrazinium&#8208;yl radical cation, [(Me3Si)2N&#8722;N(H)SiMe3].+, at very low temperatures (decomposition &gt; &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C). EPR, NMR, DFT and Raman studies revealed the formation of a nitrogen&#8208;centered radical cation along the N&#8722;N unit of the hydrazine. In the presence of the weakly coordinating anion [Al{OCH(CF3)2}4]&#8722;, crystallization and structural characterization in the solid state were achieved. The hydrazinium&#8208;yl radical cation has a significantly shortened N&#8722;N bond and a nearly planar N2Si3 framework, in contrast to the starting material. According to DFT calculations, the shortened N&#8722;N bond has a total bond order of 1.5 with a &#960;&#8208;bond order of 0.5. The &#960; bond can be regarded as a three&#8208;&#960;&#8208;electron, two&#8208;center bond.

         <title>Reactivity of Diphenylberyllium as a Br&#248;nsted Base and Its Synthetic Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Br&#248;nsted basic properties of diphenylberyllium have been used to cleanly produce a range of important benchmark compounds. The long&#8208;suspected structure of [Be3(OtBu)6] is finally verified, and shown to be static in solution; the NHC&#8208;stabilised beryllium Grignard is the first of its kind. The stark differences between Be&#8722;N and Be&#8722;P interactions are also evidenced here.







Abstract
Diphenylberyllium [Be3Ph6] is shown here to react cleanly as a Br&#248;nsted base with a vast variety of protic compounds. Through the addition of the simple molecules tBuOH, HNPh2 and HPPh2, as well as the more complex 1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolinium chloride, one or two phenyl groups in diphenylberyllium were protonated. As a result, the long&#8208;postulated structures of [Be3(OtBu)6] and [Be(&#956;&#8208;NPh2)Ph]2 have finally been verified and shown to be static in solution. Additionally [Be(&#956;&#8208;PPh2)(HPPh2)Ph]2 was generated, which is only the second beryllium&#8208;phospanide to be prepared; the stark differences between its behaviour and that of the analogous amide were also examined. The first crystalline example of a beryllium Grignard reagent with a non&#8208;bulky aryl group has also been prepared; it is stabilised with an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene.

         <title>Efficient Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting from a Discrete Hybrid Bismuth Bromide Ferroelectric Templated by Phosphonium Cation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphonium perovskitoid harvesters: A hybrid bismuth halide salt, [Me(Ph)3P]3[Bi2Br9], stabilized by phosphonium cations was synthesized and shown to exhibit ferroelectric polarization as determined by P&#8722;E loop and piezoresponse force microscopy measurements. Flexible composite devices of it with polydimethylsiloxane were fabricated and utilized as piezoelectric nanogenerators with high output voltage and power density values. The obtained voltages were further employed for capacitor charging applications.







Abstract
Bismuth containing hybrid molecular ferroelectrics are receiving tremendous attention in recent years owing to their stable and non&#8208;toxic composition. However, these perovskite&#8208;like structures are primarily limited to ammonium cations. Herein, we report a new phosphonium based discrete perovskite&#8208;like hybrid ferroelectric with a formula [Me(Ph)3P]3[Bi2Br9] (MTPBB) and its mechanical energy harvesting capability. The Polarization&#8208;Electric field (P&#8208;E) measurements resulted in a well&#8208;defined ferroelectric hysteresis loop with a remnant polarization value of 2.1&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Piezoresponse force microscopy experiments enabled visualization of the ferroelectric domain structure and evaluation of the piezoelectric strain coefficient (d33) for an MTPBB single crystal and thin film sample. Furthermore, flexible devices incorporating MTPBB in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrix at various concentrations were fabricated and explored for their mechanical energy harvesting properties. The champion device with 20&#8197;wt&#8201;% of MTPBB in PDMS rendered a maximum peak&#8208;to&#8208;peak open&#8208;circuit voltage of 22.9&#8197;V and a maximum power density of 7&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at an optimal load of 4&#8197;M&#937;. Moreover, the potential of MTPBB&#8208;based devices in low power electronics was demonstrated by storing the harvested energy in various electrolytic capacitors.

         <title>Revisiting the environment effect on mass transfer for heterogenized Ru6Pd8 metal&#8208;organic cage photocatalyst confined within 3D matrix</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial light&#8208;driven splitting of water into hydrogen involves multiple links to emulate natural photosynthesis, including light absorption, electron or energy transfer, surface catalysis et al., in which, the mass transportation of sacrificial reagent and reactant is always ignored. Metal&#8208;organic cage (MOC) of Pd  6  Ru  8  (MOC&#8208;16), assembling multiple photosensitive Ru and catalytic Pd concomitant with directional electron transfer between them, provides an opportunity to explore the environmental effects from the view point of mass transportation without disturbance of other links. Zr&#8208;MOF of UiO&#8208;66 is used as a matrix to heterogenize MOC&#8208;16 and a series of characterizations are carried out to unravel the composition, structure and optical properties. The intact MOC&#8208;16 is remained with long&#8208;term photo&#8208;stability and the outstanding photocatalytic activity is obtained by virtue of a long&#8208;lived triplet state. Three matrixes of ZIF&#8208;8, ZIF&#8208;8 derived carbonate CZIF, and UiO&#8208;66 are intercompared for mass transfer based on wettability and porous structure. Water molecule directly takes part in the formation of H  2  catalyzed by MOC&#8208;16@UiO&#8208;66, evidenced by a kinetic isotope effect, in addition to the proton delivery thanks to the hydrophilic nature of UiO&#8208;66. The porous structure of UiO&#8208;66 is essential for the permeation of sacrificial reagent to serve as two&#8208;electron donor, in sharp contrast as one&#8208;electron donor in nonporous CZIF matrix. These results highlight the importance of microenviroment surrounding molecular catalysts in view of the heterogenization of molecular catalysts, meanwhile, provide a prominent guidance on how to choose 3D support to bridge the homogenous and heterogenous system.</dc:description>

         <title>Sequential Nucleophilic Substitution of Phosphorus Trichloride with Alcohols in a Continuous&#8208;Flow Reactor and Consideration of a Mechanism for Reduced Overreaction via the Addition of Imidazole</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrated a sequential nucleophilic substitution of highly electrophilic and inexpensive phosphorus trichloride with three different alcohols in a continuous&#8208;flow reactor. A variety of alcohols including ones that contained acid&#8208;labile and/or basic&#8208;labile functionalities were rapidly reacted. An over nucleophilic substitution that occurred during reaction of the second alcohol was suppressed via the addition of imidazole. Density functional theory calculation of the sequen&#8208;tial nucleophilic substitutions of alcohols was performed both with and without imidazole, and Berry pseudorotation was suggested as a rate&#8208;limiting step in both cases. Herein we discuss the reasons for the decreased selectivity in the ab&#8208;sence of imidazole as well as those for improved selectivity in the presence of imidazole during the second nucleophilic substitution.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of the linker chemistry on the photoinduced charge&#8208;transfer dynamics of heterodinuclear photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For optimizing light&#8208;driven catalytic processes, light&#8208;mediated multi&#8208;electron transfer dynamics in molecular dyads need to be studied and correlated with structural changes focusing on the catalytically active metastable intermediates. Here, spectroelectrochemistry has been employed to investigate the structure dependent photoelectron transfer kinetics in catalytically active intermediates of two Ru&#8208;Rh&#8208;catalysts for light&#8208;driven NAD+ reduction. The excited state reactivity of short&#8208;lived intermediates was studied along different photoreaction pathways by resonance Raman and time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroelectrochemistry with sub&#8208;ps time resolution under in operando conditions. The results demonstrate for the first time, how the bridging ligand serves as an (multi&#8208;)electron storage structure, mediates the strength of the electronic coupling of catalytic and photocenter and impacts the targeted electron transfer as well as parasitic electron&#8208;transfer kinetics.</dc:description>

         <title>The effects of ring strain on cyclic tetraaryl[5]cumulenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclic tetraaryl[5]cumulenes (  1a&#8211;f  ) have been synthesized and studied as a function of increasing ring strain. The magnitude of ring strain is approximated by the extent of bending of the cumulenic core as assessed by a combination of X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and DFT calculations. Trends are observed in  13  C NMR, UV&#8208;vis, and Raman spectra associated with ring strain, but the effects are small. In particular, the experimental HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap is not appreciably affected by bending of the [5]cumulene framework from ca. 174&#176; (  &#955;  max  = 504 nm) in  1a  to ca. 178&#176; (  &#955;  max  = 494 nm) in  1f  .</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Star&#8208;Shaped Indoline Hole Transport Materials: The Influence of Planarity on the Hole Extraction and Transport Processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The planarity of the side chain of star&#8208;shaped hole transport material (HTM) is systematically improved. Along with the improvement, the HOMO level of the HTM is increased, leading to enhanced hole extraction capability. Meanwhile, the hole transport capability can also be improved due to the intensification of molecular stacking during film formation. As a result, the planar HTM achieves a relatively high efficiency of 18.48&#8201;%, providing us with a promising strategy for further optimization of efficient HTMs.







Abstract
As the key properties of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the hole extraction and transport capabilities of the hole transport material (HTM) affect the photovoltaic performance of PSCs to a considerable extent, while both capabilities can be adjusted by molecular planarity. Therefore, in this work, the molecular planarity of the HTM is systematically optimized to regulate the hole extraction and transport capabilities. Along with the improvement in planarity, the HTM&#8242;s HOMO level is increased, leading to the enhancement of hole extraction capability. Meanwhile, the hole transport capability can also be improved due to the intensification of molecular stacking during the film formation. As a result, the planar HTM achieves a relatively high efficiency of 18.48&#8201;%, which is higher than that of spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. Accordingly, the molecular planarity presents an important impact on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, providing us with a promising strategy for further optimization of efficient HTMs.

As a result, the planar HTM achieves a relatively high efficiency of 18.48&#8201;%, providing us with a promising strategy for further optimization of efficient HTMs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the key properties of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the hole extraction and transport capabilities of the hole transport material (HTM) affect the photovoltaic performance of PSCs to a considerable extent, while both capabilities can be adjusted by molecular planarity. Therefore, in this work, the molecular planarity of the HTM is systematically optimized to regulate the hole extraction and transport capabilities. Along with the improvement in planarity, the HTM&#8242;s HOMO level is increased, leading to the enhancement of hole extraction capability. Meanwhile, the hole transport capability can also be improved due to the intensification of molecular stacking during the film formation. As a result, the planar HTM achieves a relatively high efficiency of 18.48&#8201;%, which is higher than that of &lt;i&gt;spiro&lt;/i&gt;-OMeTAD. Accordingly, the molecular planarity presents an important impact on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, providing us with a promising strategy for further optimization of efficient HTMs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of folded aromatic oligoamides with absolute control of helical sense has been synthesized. These helices can implement an asymmetric reduction reaction in their cavities, and the diastereoselectivity of the reaction is significantly improved by optimization of the oligoamide sequences. More information can be found in the Research Article by Q. Gan and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200834).

         <title>Quantum Spin&#8208;
 Dimers in a Low&#8208;Dimensional Tetrabromocuprate Magnet</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Only one way: (3,4&#8208;lutH)2CuBr4 (3,4&#8208;lut=3,4&#8208;lutidine) is a homometallic spin&#8208;
 tetrabromocuprate that adopts a bilayer structure with strong antiferromagnetic coupling between dimers across the bilayer and weaker intralayer ferromagnetic interactions. First&#8208;principles calculations suggest there is only significant magnetic coupling within one direction of a layer; this is consistent with a spin&#8208;ladder motif with antiferromagnetic rung and weaker ferromagnetic rail couplings.







Abstract
This work describes a homometallic spin&#8208;
 tetrabromocuprate adopting a bilayer structure. Magnetic&#8208;susceptibility measurements show a broad maximum centred near 70&#8197;K, with fits to this data using a Heisenberg model consistent with strong antiferromagnetic coupling between neighbouring copper atoms in different layers of the bilayer. There are further weak intralayer ferromagnetic interactions between copper cations in neighbouring dimers. First&#8208;principles calculations are consistent with this, but suggest there is only significant magnetic coupling within one direction of a layer; this would suggest the presence of a spin ladder within the bilayer with antiferromagnetic rung and weaker ferromagnetic rail couplings.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes Carrying Weakly Coordinating Anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Piggyback: N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes carrying weakly coordinating anions (WCA&#8208;NHCs) are an important and versatile ligand class used in transition metal as well as main group element chemistry. Bearing a negative charge in the backbone of the heterocycle, these carbenes can convert otherwise cationic NHC complexes into their overall neutral congeners. Aspects such as their development, syntheses, reactivity and possible future applications are discussed within this concept article.







Abstract
In this Concept article we provide a brief overview of the design and preparation of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes carrying weakly coordinating anions (WCA&#8208;NHCs). The anionic charge in these ligand systems is located on an exocyclic group, for example, B(C6F5)3, tethered to the backbone of the imidazole ring, thus resembling a weakly coordinating moiety. With the general guiding principle behind the application of WCA&#8208;NHCs being the conversion of otherwise cationic NHC complexes into their overall neutral congeners, numerous transition metal as well as main group element complexes were isolated during the last decade, which are summarized herein.

         <title>Irreversible Inhibition of IspG, a Target for the Development of New Antimicrobials, by a 2&#8208;Vinyl Analogue of its MEcPP Substrate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rational design of a substrate analogue has afforded the first irreversible inhibitor of an IspG enzyme, a target for the development of new drugs to fight antimicrobial resistance. Inspired by the structural features of the natural substrate and by mechanistic aspects, we introduced a vinyl substituent to generate conjugated species during enzyme catalysis. Inhibition might occur through covalent interaction at the catalytic site. More information can be found in the Research Article by J.&#8208;B. Behr, M. Seemann, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200241).

         <title>A Self&#8208;Formed Stable PbI2/NiOx Interface with Increased Ni3+ Centers for Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 24, April 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;formed PbI2/NiOx interface to stabilize the Ni3+&#8208;rich NiOx hole transport layers is proposed. Combined with ultraviolet ozone treatment and sequential deposition, the density of Ni3+ centers was greatly increased and could be stabilized by the PbI2 interface. These merits contribute coordinately to the better charge transfer capability and the reduction of charge recombination across the PbI2/NiOx interface.







Abstract
Nickel oxide (NiOx) is a promising hole transport material (HTM) for perovskite photovoltaics owing to its chemical stability and low cost. However, most NiOx based solar cells deliver relatively weak performance because of its insufficient electrical property and interfacial contact. In this work, a self&#8208;formed PbI2/NiOx interface was developed to stabilize the Ni3+ centers, which was beneficial for electrical transport and band alignment in perovskite solar cells. Combined with ultraviolet ozone treatment (UVO) and sequential deposition, the density of Ni3+ centers was greatly increased and could be stabilized by the PbI2 interface. These merits contributed coordinately to the fast hole extraction and low energy loss across the PbI2/NiOx interface, yielding power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of over 19&#8201;%.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Suberitines A&#8211;D Featuring Tunable Biomimetic Late&#8208;Stage Oxidative Dearomatization and Acetalization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 24, April 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Total synthesis of suberitines A&#8211;D has been accomplished using cascade Hendrickson reagent&#8208;mediated intramolecular cationic cyclization, eliminative aromatization, Bronsted acid&#8208;promoted Vilsmeier cyclization, and conditionally tunable PIDA&#8208;mediated regioselective oxidative dearomatization/O,O&#8208;acetalization. The biomimetic proposal employed in the late&#8208;stage redox transformations of these marine natural products was supported by the isolation and characterization of the synthetic intermediate.







Abstract
Aaptaminoids are a unique family of marine alkaloids bearing a benzo[de][1,6]&#8208;naphthyridine core. This work describes the first total synthesis of suberitines A&#8211;D (1&#8211;4), four typical dimeric natural aaptaminoids, employing a step&#8208;saving bidirectional strategy. Key methods applied in the total synthesis include a cationic cascade to construct the bis&#8208;isoquinoline(s) with Hendrickson reagent&#8208;mediated Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;type cyclization and eliminative aromatization, and a Bronsted acid&#8208;promoted Vilsmeier cyclization to generate the naphthyridine(s). The conditionally tunable PIDA&#8208;mediated oxidative dearomatization and subsequent methanolysis or hydrolysis successfully served as a powerful biomimetic tool to elaborate the essential oxygenated functionalities of suberitines A&#8211;D (1&#8211;4) in proper solvent&#8208;combinations at the final stage of total synthesis. The biomimetic proposal employed in the late&#8208;stage redox interchanges of related natural products was eventually supported by the isolation of synthetic intermediate 23&#8201;a as a natural product from the same natural source. Biological screening revealed that five of the synthetic samples including two natural suberitines and three full&#8208;skeleton natural product&#8208;like intermediates exhibited low micromolar inhibitory activities against the growth of cancer cell line K562.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks as Unique Platforms to Gain Insight of &#963;&#8208;Hole Interactions for the Removal of Organic Dyes from Aquatic Ecosystems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 24, April 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;organic framework, with functional channels decorated with &#8722;CH2CH2SCH3 thioalkyl chains, does not only exhibit outstanding capture properties for organic dyes but also establishes that sulfur &#963;&#8208;hole interactions play a prominent role with the help of single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.







Abstract
The combination of high crystallinity and rich host&#8208;guest chemistry in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), have situated them in an advantageous position, with respect to traditional porous materials, to gain insight on specific weak noncovalent supramolecular interactions. In particular, sulfur &#963;&#8208;hole interactions are known to play a key role in the biological activity of living beings as well as on relevant molecular recognitions processes. However, so far, they have been barely explored. Here, we describe both how the combination of the intrinsic features of MOFs, especially the possibility of using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography (SCXRD), can be an extremely valuable tool to gain insight on sulfur &#963;&#8208;hole interactions, and how their rational exploitation can be enormously useful in the efficient removal of harmful organic molecules from aquatic ecosystems. Thus, we have used a MOF, prepared from the amino acid L&#8208;methionine and possessing channels decorated with &#8722;CH2CH2SCH3 thioalkyl chains, to remove a family of organic dyes at very low concentrations (10&#8197;ppm) from water. This MOF is able to efficiently capture the four dyes in a very fast manner, reaching within five minutes nearly the maximum removal. Remarkably, the crystal structure of the different organic dyes within MOFs channels could be determined by SCXRD. This has enabled us to directly visualize the important role sulfur &#963;&#8208;hole interactions play on the removal of organic dyes from aqueous solutions, representing one of the first studies on the rational exploitation of &#963;&#8208;hole interactions for water remediation.

ZS&#8208;1010 has a strong push&#8211;pull electron system composed of electron donor unit and electron acceptor unit, exhibiting strong absorption and emission in the NIR&#8208;II region. When mixed with TMA which possesses strong electron&#8208;donating characteristics, the push&#8211;pull system of ZS&#8208;1010 will be affected along with the dipole moment change, leading to the quenching of fluorescence.

         <title>Boosting Hydrogen Evolution at Visible Light Wavelengths by Using a Photocathode with Modal Strong Coupling between Plasmons and a Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot Nanocavity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 24, April 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocathode composed of gold nanoparticles, p&#8208;type nickel oxide, and a platinum film under modal strong coupling condition was fabricated. The photocathode absorbs visible light over a broad wavelength range from 500&#8197;nm to 850&#8197;nm via hybrid modes based on the modal strong coupling. The modal strong coupling boosted hydrogen evolution through the reduction of water by hot&#8208;electron, which involves hot hole&#8208;injection from gold to nickel oxide.







Abstract
Hot&#8208;hole injection from plasmonic metal nanoparticles to the valence band of p&#8208;type semiconductors and reduction by hot electrons should be improved for efficient and tuneable reduction to obtain beneficial chemical compounds. We employed the concept of modal strong coupling between plasmons and a Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot (FP) nanocavity to enhance the hot&#8208;hole injection efficiency. We fabricated a photocathode composed of gold nanoparticles (Au&#8722;NPs), p&#8208;type nickel oxide (NiO), and a platinum film (Pt film) (ANP). The ANP structure absorbs visible light over a broad wavelength range from 500&#8197;nm to 850&#8197;nm via hybrid modes based on the modal strong coupling between the plasmons of Au&#8722;NPs and the FP nanocavity of NiO on a Pt film. All wavelength regions of the hybrid modes of the modal strong coupling system promoted hot&#8208;hole injection from the Au&#8722;NPs to NiO and proton/water reduction by hot electrons.

     alt="Boosting Hydrogen Evolution at Visible Light Wavelengths by Using a Photocathode with Modal Strong Coupling between Plasmons and a Fabry-P&#233;rot Nanocavity"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A photocathode composed&lt;/b&gt; of gold nanoparticles, p-type nickel oxide, and a platinum film under modal strong coupling condition was fabricated. The photocathode absorbs visible light over a broad wavelength range from 500&#8197;nm to 850&#8197;nm via hybrid modes based on the modal strong coupling. The modal strong coupling boosted hydrogen evolution through the reduction of water by hot-electron, which involves hot hole-injection from gold to nickel oxide.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hot-hole injection from plasmonic metal nanoparticles to the valence band of p-type semiconductors and reduction by hot electrons should be improved for efficient and tuneable reduction to obtain beneficial chemical compounds. We employed the concept of modal strong coupling between plasmons and a Fabry-P&#233;rot (FP) nanocavity to enhance the hot-hole injection efficiency. We fabricated a photocathode composed of gold nanoparticles (Au&#8722;NPs), p-type nickel oxide (NiO), and a platinum film (Pt film) (ANP). The ANP structure absorbs visible light over a broad wavelength range from 500&#8197;nm to 850&#8197;nm via hybrid modes based on the modal strong coupling between the plasmons of Au&#8722;NPs and the FP nanocavity of NiO on a Pt film. All wavelength regions of the hybrid modes of the modal strong coupling system promoted hot-hole injection from the Au&#8722;NPs to NiO and proton/water reduction by hot electrons. The incident photon-to-current efficiency based on H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution through water/proton reduction by hot electrons reached 0.2&#8201;% at 650&#8197;nm and 0.04&#8201;% at 800&#8197;nm.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Relativistic Spin&#8211;Orbit Electronegativity and the Chemical Bond Between a Heavy Atom and a Light Atom</title>

Relativistic spin&#8211;orbit electronegativity and the periodic table. The relativistic spin&#8211;orbit coupling associated with the presence of a heavy atom in a molecule is shown to have a significant effect on the electron charge density, HA&#8722;LA bond distance, and NMR shielding at a neighboring light atom. This phenomenon is transparently interpreted across the periodic table of elements by the SO&#8208;induced rearrangement of the electron density and electronegativity of the HA.







Abstract
Relativistic effects are known to alter the chemical bonds and spectroscopic properties of heavy&#8208;element compounds. In this work, we introduce the concept of spin&#8211;orbit (SO) electronegativity of a heavy atom, as reflected by an SO&#8208;induced change in the interatomic distance between the heavy atom (HA) and a neighboring light atom (LA). We provide a transparent interpretation of these SO effects by using the concept of spin&#8211;orbit electron deformation density (SO&#8208;EDD). Spin&#8211;orbit coupling at the HA induces rearrangement of the electron density for the scalar&#8208;relativistically optimized geometry that, in turn, exerts a new force on the LA. The resulting expansion or contraction of the HA&#8722;LA bond depends on the nature and electron configuration of the HA. In addition, we quantify the change in atomic electronegativity induced by SO coupling for a series of hydrides, thereby complementing the SO&#8208;EDD picture. The trends in the SO&#8208;induced electronegativity and the HA&#8722;LA bond length across the periodic table of elements are demonstrated and interpreted, and also linked, intuitively, with the SO&#8208;induced NMR shielding at the LA.

         <title>Elaborated Reaction Pathway of Photothermal Catalytic CO2 Conversion with H2O on Gallium Oxide&#8208;Decorated and &#8208;Defective Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 24, April 27, 2022. </description>

Keeping active: During photothermal CO2 reduction with H2O, a Ga2O3 cocatalyst on anatase TiO2 (101) surface enhances the selective adsorption of CO2, and also balances the VO formation and CO2 reduction reactivity. Surface defect VO promotes reaction thermodynamics but tends to be consumed, and Ga2O3 helps to keep VO active.







Abstract
Ga2O3&#8208;decorated and &#8208;defective surface models based on anatase TiO2 have been established. The thermodynamic reaction pathways, including protonation, deoxygenation and hydroxylation steps, during CO2 conversion with H2O to C1 products were calculated. The calculation results demonstrate that a Ga2O3 cocatalyst enhances the selective adsorption of CO2 and slightly weakens the competitive adsorption of H2O. The promotion effect of Ga2O3 on the subsequent reaction depends on the availability of protons and electrons. Free&#8208;energy calculations revealed that the basic functional site generated by Ga2O3 not only suppresses the back reaction of the OH group after H2O directly provides protons but also maintains the surface defect oxygen vacancy (VO), which promotes the reaction thermodynamics but tends to be consumed in the process. Additionally, Ga2O3 decoration promotes VO formation, and the coexistence of Ga2O3 and VO further decreases the reaction rate&#8208;determining step energy barrier, promoting C1 production.

         <title>Promoting Proton Transfer and Stabilizing Intermediates in Catalytic Water Oxidation via Hydrophobic Outer Sphere Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 24, April 27, 2022. </description>

Outer coordination sphere engineering: A series of pocket&#8208;shaped catalysts with well&#8208;defined outer coordination environments were synthesized and characterized, showing that the hydrophobic outer coordination sphere could stabilize high&#8208;valent intermediates and promote proton transfer during water oxidation catalysis. The introduction of hydrophobic outer&#8208;sphere interactions is therefore envisaged as an effective strategy to tune other related proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions.







Abstract
The outer coordination sphere of metalloenzyme often plays an important role in its high catalytic activity, however, this principle is rarely considered in the design of man&#8208;made molecular catalysts. Herein, four Ru&#8208;bda (bda=2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;6,6&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylate) based molecular water oxidation catalysts with well&#8208;defined outer spheres are designed and synthesized. Experimental and theoretical studies showed that the hydrophobic environment around the Ru center could lead to thermodynamic stabilization of the high&#8208;valent intermediates and kinetic acceleration of the proton transfer process during catalytic water oxidation. By this outer sphere stabilization, a 6&#8208;fold rate increase for water oxidation catalysis has been achieved.

         <title>Metalloimmunotherapy with Rhodium and Ruthenium Complexes: Targeting Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 24, April 27, 2022. </description>

Rhodium and ruthenium complexes are revealed as promising new agents for metalloimmunotherapy. Leads were identified that kill immunosuppressive M2 macrophages selectively, sensitize macrophage/cancer cell 3D co&#8208;culture spheroids to a chemotherapeutic drug and increase cell surface exposure of calreticulin, a key event in immunogenic cell death.







Abstract
Tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) suppress the cancer immune response and are a key target for immunotherapy. The effects of ruthenium and rhodium complexes on TAMs have not been well characterized. To address this gap in the field, a panel of 22 dirhodium and ruthenium complexes were screened against three subtypes of macrophages, triple&#8208;negative breast cancer and normal breast tissue cells. Experiments were carried out in 2D and biomimetic 3D co&#8208;culture experiments with and without irradiation with blue light. Leads were identified with cell&#8208;type&#8208;specific toxicity toward macrophage subtypes, cancer cells, or both. Experiments with 3D spheroids revealed complexes that sensitized the tumor models to the chemotherapeutic doxorubicin. Cell surface exposure of calreticulin, a known facilitator of immunogenic cell death (ICD), was increased upon treatment, along with a concomitant reduction in the M2&#8208;subtype classifier arginase. Our findings lay a strong foundation for the future development of ruthenium&#8208; and rhodium&#8208;based chemotherapies targeting TAMs.

         <title>Impact of Intermolecular Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions in a CuI8PdII1 Discrete Assembly: Conformers&#8217; Geometries and Stimuli&#8208;Sensitive Luminescence Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 24, April 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combined experimental and computational study highlights the crucial role played by intermolecular non&#8208;covalent weak&#8208;interactions in the conformer selection, the solid&#8208;state organization and the photophysical properties observed in a series of phases of a CuI8PdII2 multimetallic assembly. Rationalization of the structure/properties relationships allows understanding their mechanical and thermal stimuli&#8208;sensitive responses.







Abstract
A new highly solid&#8208;state luminescent phase of a previously reported weakly luminescent CuI8PdII1 dicationic assembly is reported revealing the high geometrical versatility of this moiety that importantly alters its luminescent properties. This very minor new species Bc is based on a different conformer scaffold than the one encountered in the previously reported Bo form and, essentially differs from Bo by displaying shorter CuI&#8208;CuI intermetallic distances. DFT calculations allow concluding that the predominance in the solid&#8208;state of the weakly luminescent and less stable Bo phase is due to the extra stability induced by a larger number of intermolecular non&#8208;covalent &#960;&#8208;CH interactions in its crystalline packing and not by the intrinsic stability of the CuI8PdII1 dicationic moiety. Calculations also revealed that a more stable conformation Bcalc is expected in vacuum, which bears a different distribution of CuI&#8208;CuI intermetallic distances than the dications in Bo and Bc phases. Taking into account that the geometrical alterations are associated to drastic changes of luminescence properties, this confer to the CuI8PdII1 assembly high potentiality as stimuli&#8208;sensitive luminescent materials. Indeed, by applying mechanical or thermal stress to samples of Bo phase, new phases Bg and Bm, respectively, were obtained. Alterations of the solid&#8208;state photophysical properties of these new species compared to those recorded for Bo are reported together with a combined experimental and computed study of the structures/properties relationships observed in these phases.

         <dc:description>
The two&#8208;photon&#8208;excited fluorophores exhibiting large two&#8208;photon absorption cross sections and high fluorescence efficiency are highly pursued. Herein, two 3,3&#8217;&#8208;diamino&#8208;5,5&#8217;&#8208;diboryl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bithienyls are reported which are characterized by a quadrupolar structure and display good fluorescence efficiency and large two&#8208;photon absorption cross sections reaching 473&#8197;GM.







Abstract
The quest for fluorophores exhibiting large two&#8208;photon absorption cross sections and high fluorescence efficiency is an important topic. Two 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bithienyl derivatives are disclosed which contain two N,N&#8208;disubstituted amino and two dimesitylboryl groups at 3,3&#8217;&#8208; and 5,5&#8217;&#8208;positions, respectively. Despite the great steric effect of amino groups, the bithienyl skeleton still adopts a coplanar geometry. Herein, they are characterized by a quadrupolar structure and display good fluorescence efficiency and large two&#8208;photon absorption cross sections up to 473&#8197;GM.

         <title>Syntheses of Anthracene&#8208;Centered Large PAH Diimides and Conjugated Polymers**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 24, April 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A benzannulation reaction followed by intramolecular arylation has been applied to the synthesis of a PAH diimide (BFDI) featuring a central anthracene moiety. When BFDI is coupled with 1,4&#8208;diketopyrrolo[3,4&#8208;c]&#8208;pyrrole (DPP) via thiophene and dithiophene linkers, two polymers with significantly red&#8208;shifted, broad absorptions are prepared, evidencing the effective &#960;&#8208;conjugative extension ability of BFDI and charge&#8208;transfer characteristic of the polymer backbones.







Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) structures with suitable electron&#8208;withdrawing groups are useful building blocks for developing optical and electron&#8208;transporting materials. Here, we report the application of a double benzannulation process to the syntheses of PAH diimides with enlarged &#960;&#8208;frameworks featuring a central anthracene moiety. The preparations are realized by copper&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] cycloaddition of ethynyl&#8208;substituted aromatic dicarboximide to 2,5&#8208;bis(phenylethynyl)terephthalaldehyde, followed by intramolecular photocyclization or direct arylation via Heck cross coupling. A central symmetric benzo[1,2&#8208;k:4,5&#8208;k&#8242;]&#8208;bis(fluoranthene)&#8208;3,4,12,13&#8208;tetracarboxyl diimide (BFDI) is acquired, with the single crystal structure revealing its completely planar polycyclic skeleton. Such a shape&#8208;persistent PAH expectedly exhibits a tendency to stack face&#8208;to&#8208;face and forms J&#8208;aggregates. Moreover, BFDI can be difunctionalized site&#8208;selectively at the reactive 9 and 10 positions of the anthracene unit and then applied to prepare conjugated polymers. When coupled with 1,4&#8208;diketopyrrolo[3,4&#8208;c]&#8208;pyrrole (DPP) via thiophene and dithiophene linkers, two polymers with significantly broadened absorption bands extended to the near&#8208;infrared regime are obtained, evidencing the effective &#960;&#8208;conjugative extension ability of BFDI unit.

         <title>DoE&#8208;Driven Development of an Organocatalytic Enantioselective Addition of Acetaldehyde to Nitrostyrenes in Water**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 24, April 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
It's in the design: Moving from organic solvents to water is not always an easy task, especially when a lot of variables need to be screened. The development of an enantioselective enamine&#8208;catalysed Michael addition of acetaldehyde to nitroalkenes in water was developed by using a rational approach, via chemometrics&#8208;assisted &#8216;Design of Experiments&#8217; (DoE) optimisation. This way it was possible to screen 9 different parameters, their interaction with each other, and the full chemical space, with minimum experiments in an efficient manner.







Abstract
The development of an enantioselective enamine&#8208;catalysed addition of masked acetaldehyde to nitroalkenes via a rational approach helped to move away from the use of chloroform. The presented research allows the use of water as a reaction medium, therefore improving the industrial relevance of a protocol to access very important pharmaceutical intermediates. Critical to the success is the use of chemometrics&#8208;assisted &#8216;Design of Experiments&#8217; (DoE) optimisation during the development of the presented new synthetic approach, which allows to investigate the chemical space in a rational way.

A transition metal&#8208;free, simple and efficient strategy to access alkyl 1,2&#8208;bis(boronate esters) via regio&#8208; and diastereoselective diboration of readily available secondary and tertiary alkyl halides (Br, Cl, I), tosylates, and alcohols was developed. The use of KI and DMA is critical to the methodology, which circumvents the regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity problems. The transformation showed a broad substrate scope (75 examples), and practicality for the late&#8208;stage modification of natural products.







Abstract
Defunctionalization of readily available feedstocks to provide alkenes for the synthesis of multifunctional molecules represents an extremely useful process in organic synthesis. Herein, we describe a transition metal&#8208;free, simple and efficient strategy to access alkyl 1,2&#8208;bis(boronate esters) via regio&#8208; and diastereoselective diboration of secondary and tertiary alkyl halides (Br, Cl, I), tosylates, and alcohols. Control experiments demonstrated that the key to this high reactivity and selectivity is the addition of a combination of potassium iodide and N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide (DMA). The practicality and industrial potential of this transformation are demonstrated by its operational simplicity, wide functional group tolerance, and the late&#8208;stage modification of complex molecules. From a drug discovery perspective, this synthetic method offers control of the position of diversification and diastereoselectivity in complex ring scaffolds, which would be especially useful in a lead optimization program.

         <title>Stereodivergent Desymmetrization of Simple Dicarboxylates via Branch&#8208;Selective Pd/Cu Catalyzed Allylic Substitution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 24, April 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd/Cu catalyzed stereodivergent desymmetrization of unsubstituted allylic dicarboxylates was developed and the corresponding products could be generated in excellent yields with good stereoselectivity. Notably, the reaction favored branch&#8208;selectivity. Large scale experiment and the transformations of products indicated the potential utility of this reaction. In addition, computational studies revealed that the greater electrophilicity of branch carbon in the &#960;&#8208;allyl&#8208;Pd intermediate and the weak noncovalent interactions among the substrates and the catalysts contributed to the high branch&#8208;selectivity of this reaction.







Abstract
Asymmetric desymmetrization has been demonstrated to be a powerful strategy for building stereocenters in asymmetric synthesis. Herein, a Pd/Cu catalyzed asymmetric desymmetrization reaction with a simple geminal dicarboxylate is reported. A wide scope of imino esters bearing an aryl or heteroaromatic group were compatible with this bimetallic catalytic system. The reactions proceeded smoothly, giving the desired products in good yields with high to excellent regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivity (up to 20&#8201;:&#8201;1 branched:linear, &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr, &gt;99&#8201;% ee). Notably, the reaction favored branched selectivity, which is unusual for the Pd&#8208;catalyzed allylic alkylation reaction. In addition, the standard product could be easily transformed to other valuable molecules such as chiral allylic alcohols, carbamates, and organic boron compounds. Furthermore, DFT calculations were conducted to explain the origin of the branched selectivity.

The elaborate thermodynamic reaction pathways on Ga2O3&#8208;decorated and &#8208;defective surfaces during photothermal catalytic CO2 conversion with H2O have been established. The basic site generated by Ga2O3 decoration on an anatase TiO2 (101) surface enhances the selective adsorption of CO2, and also balances VO formation and CO2 reduction activity. Surface&#8208;defect VO promotes the reaction thermodynamics but tends to be consumed; Ga2O3 helps to keep VO active. Ga2O3 and VO together further decrease the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step, thereby promoting C1 production. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y.&#8208;W. Zhang et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104490).

Ultraviolet ozone flushing (UVO) has been used to oxidize the NiOx hole&#8208;transport layer (yellow). The lattice bottom left shows the activation of Ni3+ (red balls) at the top of the NiOx film, which can enhance the electrical properties and hole extraction ability of NiOx. Then, by adopting sequential deposition of perovskites, residual PbI2 is automatically formed at the bottom interface (brown layer); this prevents the NiOx film from coming into direct contact with the perovskite layer, thus avoiding NiOx&#8208;related chemical reactions.

         <title>Frontispiece: Nitrogen Donor Protection for Atomically Precise Metal Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 24, April 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, metal&#8208;nitrogen interfaces in metal nanoclusters are resolved at atomic level. The synthetic methods, total structure determination and properties of metal nanoclusters protected by N&#8208;donor ligands are covered. It is expected that this review could stimulate the study of structural control and functional modulation of metal nanoclusters with the protection of functionalized N&#8208;donor ligands.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 24, April 27, 2022. </description>

Metal complexes of directly linked metalloporphyrine and corrole oligomers have been extensively studied due to their intriguing optical and electronic properties. In this regard, the impact of the different type of direct linkages on electrochemical, magnetic, electronic and electrocatalytic properties of various metallopophyrine and corrole oligomers have been discussed at length in this Review article.







Abstract
Metal complexes of multi&#8208;porphyrins and multi&#8208;corroles are unique systems that display a host of extremely interesting properties. Availability of free meso and &#946; positions allow formation of different types of directly linked bis&#8208;porphyrins giving rise to intriguing optical and electronic properties. While the fields of metalloporphyrin and corroles monomer have seen exponential growth in the last decades, the chemistry of metal complexes of bis&#8208;porphyrins and bis&#8208;corroles remain rather underexplored. Therefore, the impact of covalent linkages on the optical, electronic, (spectro)electrochemical, magnetic and electrocatalytic activities of metal complexes of bis&#8208;porphyrins and &#8208;corroles has been summarized in this review article. This article shows that despite the (still) somewhat difficult synthetic access to these molecules, their extremely exciting properties do make a strong case for pursuing research on these classes of compounds.

         <title>Nitrogen Donor Protection for Atomically Precise Metal Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 24, April 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Beyond the conventional thiolate, phosphine and alkynyl ligands, nitrogen donor ligands have recently emerged as protecting agents for well&#8208;defined metal nanoclusters. Given the terminal coordination preference of the negatively charged amido and amidinate ligands with multidentate donors, interesting structural and functional features are observed for metal nanoclusters protected by these types of N donor ligands.







Abstract
Surface organic ligands are critical in dictating the structures and properties of atomically precise metal nanoclusters. In contrast to the conventionally used thiolate, phosphine and alkynyl ligands, nitrogen donor ligands have not been used in the protection for well&#8208;defined metal nanoclusters until recently. This review focuses on recent developments in atomically precise metal nanoclusters stabilized by different types of nitrogen donor ligands, in which the synthesis, total structure determination and various properties are covered. We hope that this review will provide insights into the rational design of N donor&#8208;protected metal nanoclusters in terms of structural and functional modulation.

         <title>Significant Effect of Flexibility of Bridging Alkyl Chains on&#160;the&#160;Proximity of Stacked Porphyrin and Phthalocyanine Conjugated with Fourfold Rotaxane Linkage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The spatial distance is an important factor in controlling the functional interactions between molecular units in a conjugate; therefore, the bridging unit was closely examined.&#160; Herein, we examined the effect of the flexibility of bridging alkyl chains &#160;on the proximity of stacked porphyrin and phthalocyanine conjugated with a fourfold rotaxane linkage. We found that closely stacking two&#160; &#960; &#160;systems&#160;requires bridging alkyl chains above&#160;a certain length, and the shorter bridges hinder stacking because of their lower flexibility. The stacking distance between porphyrin and phthalocyanine in the conjugate with decyl (C10) chains was estimated to be 4.03 &#197; and showed&#160;a unique physical character&#160;arising from short&#8208;distance interactions. The&#160;longer alkyl chains minimized steric restriction inside the fourfold rotaxane and allowed efficient communication between the porphyrin and phthalocyanine units. This is due to the flexibility of the side chains.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Participation of Solvent Molecules in the Formation of Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This article reports supramolecular polymerization of two naphthalene&#8208;diimide (NDI) building blocks (NDI&#8208;L and NDI&#8208;C) in&#160;n&#8208;heptane (Hep) and methylcyclohexane (MCH). NDI&#8208;L and NDI&#8208;C differ only by the peripheral hydrocarbon wedges, consisting of linear C7 chains or cyclic methylcyclohexane rings, respectively. UV/Vis and FT&#8208;IR spectra&#160;reveal distinct internal&#8208;order and H&#8208;bonding&#160; for NDI&#8208;L and NDI&#8208;C aggregates irrespective of the solvent, indicating a dominant role of the intrinsic packing parameters of the individual building block. However, NDI&#8208;L produces a significantly stronger gel in Hep compared to MCH. In contrast, NDI&#8208;C exhibits a clear preference for MCH, producing gel with moderate strength but in Hep it fails to produce 1D morphology or gel. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies corroborate with the experimental results and provide a quantitative estimate regarding the thermodynamics of self&#8208;assembly in these four combinations. Such clear&#8208;cut shape&#8208;matching effect (between the peripheral hydrocarbon wedge and the solvent system) unambiguously support a direct participation of the solvent molecules during supramolecular polymerization and presence of a closely&#8208;adhered solvent shell around the supramolecular polymers, similar to the first layer of water molecules around the protein surface. Solvent induced CD experiments support this hypothesis as induced CD band was observed only from a chiral co&#8208;solvent of matching shape. This is reconfirmed by the higher de&#8208;solvation temperature of the shape&#8208;matching NDI/solvent system combination compared to the shape mis&#8208;match combination in variable temperature UV/Vis experiments, revealing transformation to a different aggregate at higher temperatures rather than disassembly to the monomer for all four combinations.</dc:description>

         <title>Breaking the Aliphatic Wall: Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Reductive Amination of Ketones and Secondary Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct reductive amination (DRA) is a ubiquitous reaction in organic chemistry. This transformation between a carbonyl group and an amine is most often achieved using super stoichiometric amount of hazardous hydride reagents, thus being incompatible with many sensitive functional groups. DRA could also be achieved by means of chemo&#8208; or bio&#8208;catalysis, thereby attracting the interest of industry as well as academic laboratories due to their virtually perfect atomeconomy. Although DRA are well&#8208;established for substrate pairs such as aldehydes with either 1 o or 2 o amines as well as ketones with 1 o amines, the current methodologies are limited in the case of ketones with 2 o amines. Herein, we present a general DRA protocol that overcomes this major limitation by means of iridium catalysis. The applicability of the methodology is demonstrated by accessing an unprecedented range of biologically relevant tertiary amines starting from both aliphatic ketones and aliphatic amines. The choice of a disphosphane ligand (Josiphos A or Xantphos) is essential for the success of the transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent and Supramolecular Polymers: from Monolayer to Bilayer and the Thicker</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective preparation of two&#8208;dimensional polymers (2DPs) and supramolecular polymers (2DSPs) with defined thickness is crucially important for controlling and maximizing their functions, yet it has remained as a synthetic challenge. In the past decade, several approaches have been developed to allow selective preparation of discrete monolayer 2DPs and 2DSPs. Recently, crystal exfoliation and self&#8208;assembly strategies have been employed to successfully prepare bilayer 2DP and 2DSP, which represent the first step towards the controlled &#8220;growth&#8221; of 2D polymers from the thinnest monolayers to thicker few&#8208;layers along the third dimension. This Concept review discusses the concept of accurate synthesis of 2D polymers with defined layers. Advances in this research area will pave the way to rational synthetic strategies for 2D polymers with controlled thickness.</dc:description>

         <title>A Series of Rare&#8208;Earth Mesoionic Carbene Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis and characterisation of a series of rare&#8208;earth mesoionic carbene complexes, [RE{N(SiMe  3  )  2  }  3  {CN(Me)C(Me)N(Me)CH}] (  3RE  , RE = Sc, Ce, Pr, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, and Lu), greatly expanding the limited library of f&#8208;block mesoionic carbene complexes. These complexes were prepared by treatment of the parent RE&#8208;triamides with an N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin (NHO), where an NHO backbone proton undergoes a formal 1,4&#8208;proton migration to the NHO&#8208;methylene group. For all RE(III) metals, as expected, quantum chemical calculations suggest only a&#160; &#963; &#8208; component to the metal&#8208;carbene bonding, in contrast to a previously reported uranium(III) congener where the 5f  3  &#160;metal engages in a weak&#160; &#960; &#8208;back&#8208;bond to the MIC. All complexes were characterized by static variable&#8208;temperature magnetic measurements, and dynamic magnetic measurements reveal that&#160;  3Dy  &#160;and&#160;  3Er  &#160;are field&#8208;induced single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs), with&#160; U  eff  &#160;energy barriers of 35 and 128 K, respectively.

         <title>Excited&#8208;state distortions promote the photochemical 4&#960;&#8208;electrocyclizations of fluorobenzenes via machine learning accelerated photodynamics simulations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photochemistry of benzene is complex and non&#8208;selective because numerous mechanistic pathways are accessible in the ground and excited states. Fluorination is a known strategy to increase the chemoselectivities for Dewar&#8208;benzenes via 4&#960;&#8208;disrotatory electrocyclization. However, the origin of the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities of fluorobenzenes remains unexplained because of experimental limitations in resolving the excited&#8208;state structures on ultrafast timescales. The computational cost of multiconfigurational nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations is also generally prohibitive. We now provide high&#8208;fidelity structural information and reaction outcome predictions with machine&#8208;learning&#8208;accelerated photodynamics simulations of a series of fluorobenzenes, C  6  F  6&#8208;n  H  n  , n=0&#8211;3, to study their S  1  &#8594;S  0  decay in 4 ns. We trained neural networks with XMS&#8208;CASPT2(6,7)/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVDZ calculations, which reproduced the S  1  absorption features with mean absolute errors of 0.04 eV (&lt; 2 nm). The predicted nonradiative decay constants for C  6  F  4  H  2  , C  6  F  6  , C  6  F  3  H  3  , and C  6  F  5  H are 116, 60, 28, and 12 ps, respectively, in line with the experiments. Our calculations show that the pseudo Jahn&#8208;Teller distortions create the S  1  minimum region that prolongs the excited&#8208;state lifetime of fluorobenzenes. The pseudo Jahn&#8208;Teller distortions reduce when fluorination decreases. Analysis of the S  1  dynamics suggests that the pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8208;Teller distortions promote a  cis&#8208;trans  isomerization of a &#120587;  C&#8208;C  &#8208;bond. We characterized the surface hopping points from our NAMD simulations and identified instantaneous nuclear momentum as a factor that promoted &#120590;&#8208;bond formation in the 4&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The photochemistry of benzene is complex and non-selective because numerous mechanistic pathways are accessible in the ground and excited states. Fluorination is a known strategy to increase the chemoselectivities for Dewar-benzenes via 4&#960;-disrotatory electrocyclization. However, the origin of the chemo- and regioselectivities of fluorobenzenes remains unexplained because of experimental limitations in resolving the excited-state structures on ultrafast timescales. The computational cost of multiconfigurational nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations is also generally prohibitive. We now provide high-fidelity structural information and reaction outcome predictions with machine-learning-accelerated photodynamics simulations of a series of fluorobenzenes, C  6  F  6-n  H  n  , n=0&#8211;3, to study their S  1  &#8594;S  0  decay in 4 ns. We trained neural networks with XMS-CASPT2(6,7)/aug-cc-pVDZ calculations, which reproduced the S  1  absorption features with mean absolute errors of 0.04 eV (&amp;lt; 2 nm). The predicted nonradiative decay constants for C  6  F  4  H  2  , C  6  F  6  , C  6  F  3  H  3  , and C  6  F  5  H are 116, 60, 28, and 12 ps, respectively, in line with the experiments. Our calculations show that the pseudo Jahn-Teller distortions create the S  1  minimum region that prolongs the excited-state lifetime of fluorobenzenes. The pseudo Jahn-Teller distortions reduce when fluorination decreases. Analysis of the S  1  dynamics suggests that the pseudo-Jahn-Teller distortions promote a  cis-trans  isomerization of a &#120587;  C-C  -bond. We characterized the surface hopping points from our NAMD simulations and identified instantaneous nuclear momentum as a factor that promoted &#120590;-bond formation in the 4&#960;-electrocyclization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Strong Antibiotic Activity of the Myxocoumarin Scaffold in vitro and in vivo</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Myxocoumarin B from Stigmatella aurantiaca MYX&#8208;030 is shown to possess strong antibiotic activity against a range of clinically relevant pathogens. Synthesis of a diverse compound library of structural analogs enabled investigations into initial structure&#8208;activity relationships and revealed the potential of the myxocoumarin scaffold as lead structure for the development of new antibiotics. Myxocoumarin B and analogs show low toxicity in&#8197;vivo in a zebrafish infection model and were superior in clearing bacterial infections when compared to established antibiotics such as vancomycin.







Abstract
The increasing emergence of resistances against established antibiotics is a substantial threat to human health. The discovery of new compounds with potent antibiotic activity is thus of utmost importance. Within this work, we identify strong antibiotic activity of the natural product myxocoumarin B from Stigmatella aurantiaca MYX&#8208;030 against a range of clinically relevant bacterial pathogens, including clinical isolates of MRSA. A focused library of structural analogs was synthesized to explore initial structure&#8208;activity relationships and to identify equipotent myxocoumarin derivatives devoid of the natural nitro substituent to significantly streamline synthetic access. The cytotoxicity of the myxocoumarins as well as their potential to cure bacterial infections in vivo was established using a zebrafish model system. Our results reveal the exceptional antibiotic activity of the myxocoumarin scaffold and hence its potential for the development of novel antibiotics.

         <title>Chemo&#8208; and regioselective anionic Fries rearrangement promoted by lithium amides under aerobic conditions in sustainable reaction media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A straightforward and efficient protocol to promote the metalation/anionic Fries rearrangements of O&#8208;aryl carbamates, using for the first time a lithium amide as metalating agent under aerobic/ambient&#8208;friendly reaction conditions, is reported. This approach enables the sustainable preparation of salicylamide derivatives with high levels of chemoselectivity within ultrafast reaction times, working at room temperature in the presence of air/moisture, and using the environmentally responsive cyclopentyl methyl ether as a solvent. Furthermore, the regioselective manipulation of O&#8208;2&#8208;tolyl carbamates has been accomplished using interchangeably alkyllithiums or lithium amides, with an unexpected beneficial contribution from the employment of biorenewable protic eutectic mixtures as non&#8208;innocent reaction media.</dc:description>

         <title>Cross&#8208;talks between Sulfane Sulfur and Thiol at a Zinc(II) Site</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transformations of sulfane sulfur compounds (  e.g.  &#160; organic&#160; polysulfides (R &#8211;S  n  &#8211;R, n&gt;2) and elemental sulfur (S  8  ) ) play pivotal roles in the biochemical landscape of sulfur, and thus supports signaling activities of H  2  S. Although a number of previous reports illustrate amine mediated reactions of S  8  &#160;and thiol (RSH) yielding R &#8211;S  n  &#8211;R , this report illustrates that a tripodal [Zn  II  ] complex [(  Bn  3  Tren  )Zn  II  &#8211;OH  2  ](ClO  4  )  2  &#160;(  1  ) facilitates the reactions of sulfane sulfur and thiol (RSH), thereby offering an amine&#8208;free biologically relevant complementary route.&#160;UV&#8208;vis monitoring of the reactions and a set of control experiments underline the definitive role of [Zn  II  ] coordination motif in the reactions of sulfane sulfur (  e.g.  &#160;S  8  &#160;and R&#8211;S  n  &#8211;R) with RSH.&#160; Detailed investigations (UV&#8208;vis, NMR, ESI&#8208;MS, intermediate trapping, and TEMPO radical interference experiments) disclose the key differences in the [Zn  II  ]&#160;  versus  &#160;previously known amine mediated routes. Moreover, the persulfide (RSS  &#8211;  ) trapping experiments using 1&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2,4&#8208;dinitrobenzene (F&#8211;DNB) reveal the intermediacy of RSS  &#8211;  &#160;species in the [Zn  II  ] mediated reactions of sulfane sulfur and thiol, thereby demonstrating [Zn  II  ] assisted persulfidation of thiol in the presence of sulfane sulfur species.

         <title>Boosting Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution over Ce&#8722;Co9S8 Core&#8211;Shell Nanoneedle Arrays by Electronic and Architectural Dual Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rare&#8208;earth&#8208;based nanomaterials for catalysis: Ce&#8208;doped Co9S8 core&#8211;shell nanoneedle arrays, vertically aligned on carbon cloth (Ce&#8722;Co9S8@CC) were prepared in&#8197;situ by calcining a Ce&#8722;Co(CO3)0.5OH@CC precursor. The Ce&#8208;incorporated Co9S8 active component and core&#8211;shell nanoneedle arrayed architecture give Ce&#8722;Co9S8@CC a refigured electronic configuration, highly exposed active sites and multidimensional mass diffusion channels. Benefitting from these dual electronic and architectural advantages, Ce&#8722;Co9S8@CC exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity, stability and selectivity toward the oxygen evolution reaction.







Abstract
An dual electronic and architectural engineering strategy is a good way to rationally design earth&#8208;abundant and highly efficient electrocatalysts of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for sustainable hydrogen&#8208;based energy devices. Here, a Ce&#8208;doped Co9S8 core&#8211;shell nanoneedle array (Ce&#8722;Co9S8@CC) supported on a carbon cloth has been designed and developed to accelerate the sluggish kinetics of the OER. Profiting from valance alternative Ce doping, a fine core&#8211;shell structure and vertically aligned nanoneedle arrayed architecture, Ce&#8722;Co9S8@CC integrates modulated electronic structure, highly exposed active sites, and multidimensional mass diffusion channels; together, these afford a favorable catalyzed OER. Ce&#8722;Co9S8@CC exhibits remarkable performance in the OER in an alkaline medium, where the overpotential requires only 242&#8197;mV to deliver a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for the OER; this is 70&#8197;mV superior to that of Ce&#8208;free Co9S8 catalyst and other counterparts. Good stability and impressive selectivity (nearly 100&#8201;% Faradic efficiency) are also demonstrated. When integrated into a two&#8208;electrode OER//HER electrolyzer, the as&#8208;prepared Ce&#8722;Co9S8@CC displays a low operation potential of 1.54&#8197;V at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and long&#8208;term stability, thus demonstrating great potential for economical water electrolysis.

         <title>Cobalt Complexes Supported by Phosphinoquinoline Ligands for the Catalyzed Hydrosilylation of Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphinoquinoline cobalt(II) complexes were used for the hydrosilylation of ketones. The diisopropylphosphino containing bisliganded complex was the most efficient allowing the transformation of variously substituted aliphatic or aromatic ketones at low catalyst loading and under mild conditions. The involvement of a Co&#8722;H complex as the active species was experimentally ascertained.







Abstract
P,N phosphinoquinoline based ligands differing by the nature of the phosphorus substituent (iPr, Ph) were employed to synthesize a series of cobalt(II) complexes ([LCoBr2], [L2CoBr](PF6) and [L&#8217;2CoBr](PF6)). The latter were obtained in high yield and characterized among others by X&#8208;ray analysis and elemental analysis. Complex [L2CoBr](PF6) showed a very good catalytic activity for the hydrosilylation of various ketones. The catalysis proceeds at a low catalytic loading (1&#8197;mol&#8201;%) with only 1 equivalent of Ph2SiH2 in mild conditions and was efficient with aliphatic or aromatic ketones giving moderate to excellent yields of the corresponding silylated ether.

         <title>How the Chalcogen Atom Size Dictates the Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Donor Capability of Carboxamides, Thioamides, and Selenoamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bigger the better! Thioamides and selenoamides are better hydrogen&#8208;bond donors than carboxamides because their amino groups are more positively charged. Quantum chemical analyses reveal that this counterintuitive phenomenon, which is not explainable by the electronegativity, results from the effective steric size of the chalcogen atoms.







Abstract
The amino groups of thio&#8208; and selenoamides can act as stronger hydrogen&#8208;bond donors than of carboxamides, despite the lower electronegativity of S and Se. This phenomenon has been experimentally explored, particularly in organocatalysis, but a sound electronic explanation is lacking. Our quantum chemical investigations show that the NH2 groups in thio&#8208; and selenoamides are more positively charged than in carboxamides. This originates from the larger electronic density flow from the nitrogen lone pair of the NH2 group towards the lower&#8208;lying &#960;*C=S and &#960;*C=Se orbitals than to the high&#8208;lying &#960;*C=O orbital. The relative energies of the &#960;* orbitals result from the overlap between the chalcogen np and carbon 2p atomic orbitals, which is set by the carbon&#8208;chalcogen equilibrium distance, a consequence of the Pauli repulsion between the two bonded atoms. Thus, neither the electronegativity nor the often&#8208;suggested polarizability but the steric size of the chalcogen atom determines the amide's hydrogen&#8208;bond donor capability.

         <title>First&#8208;Principles Design of Na&#8208;ion Superionic Conductors: Interstitial&#8208;Based Na Diffusion in NaCuZrS3</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state electrolytes are usually based on vacancies of diffusing ions to enhance diffusivity. NaCuZrS3 with a post&#8208;perovskite&#8208;like structure exhibits an interstitial&#8208;based Na ion diffusion mechanism. The low diffusion barriers of the order of 0.22&#8197;eV in the two &#8208; dimensional interlayer channels suggest a new class of Na&#8208;ion superionic conductors for further exploration. Doping by trivalent ions (such as La) on Zr sites could help introduce Na interstitials.







Abstract
In recent years all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SS&#8208;SIBs) have drawn significant attention due to their potential to be safer and lower cost than lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the lack of sodium solid&#8208;state electrolytes with high ionic conductivity has become one of the major challenges. Here, with first&#8208;principles computation we took NaCuZrS3, consisting of earth&#8208;abundant and environmentally benign elements only, as an example to study Na&#8208;ion transport in the post&#8208;perovskite&#8208;like structure and used computation&#8208;guided design to improve its potential as a solid&#8208;state electrolyte. With ab initio molecular dynamics simulation and nudged elastic band calculation, we studied possible diffusion mechanisms in this material and found that Na ion interstitials have a favorable migration barrier of 0.22&#8197;eV, which is among the smallest in the literature reported values. Considering the large formation energy of Frenkel defects, we proposed doping strategy to introduce extra Na interstitials in the material. Our study suggests that the post&#8208;perovskite&#8208;like sulfides are worth of exploration for applications in SS&#8208;SIBs.

         <title>Design of Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Phenothiazine Derivatives with Triplet&#8208;Related Dual Emission and High&#8208;Contrast Mechanochromism Guided by Polymorph Prediction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potential conformations of phenothiazine derivatives were well predicted by Polymorph Prediction. The crystals of those derivatives with the potential to form both quasi&#8208;axial (ax) and quasi&#8208;equatorial (eq) conformations could undergo conformation transition and showed high&#8208;contrast mechanochromism (MC). All the derivatives exhibited aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) and triplet&#8208;related dual emission (DEM) characters.







Abstract
The development of high&#8208;contrast stimulus&#8208;responsive materials with excited triplet emission is of great significance for anti&#8208;counterfeiting, sensor and memory applications, but remains a challenge. Here, we report a strategy for the rational design of stimulus&#8208;responsive phenothiazine derivatives with triplet&#8208;related dual emissions and high&#8208;contrast mechanochromism guided by Polymorph Prediction. The designed phenothiazine derivatives have the characters of simple structures, a facile synthetic procedure, and a good crystalline nature. We found that the crystals of those derivatives with the potential to form both quasi&#8208;axial (ax) and quasi&#8208;equatorial (eq) conformations could undergo conformation transition and show significant emission difference (&#916;&#955;em&gt;100&#8197;nm) under mechanical force. Meanwhile, all these phenothiazine derivatives exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced emission and emit room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence or thermally activated delayed fluorescence. The significant luminescent change of these materials under different stimuli gives them promise for applications in encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Large Enhancement of the Single&#8208;Molecular Conductance of a Molecular Wire through a Radical Substituent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular conductance of radical&#8208;substituted molecular wire was evaluated by STM apparent&#8208;height measurement compared with a non&#8208;radical&#8208;substituted wire. Statistical analysis of the STM images revealed that the radical&#8208;substituted wire has a 3.2&#8208;fold larger conductance. Although only 17&#8201;% of the SOMO is calculated to exist on the wire moiety, the effect was significant. This study presents the potential of radical substituents to achieve high conductivity in molecular wires. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. Matsuda and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104242).

         <title>Acenaphthenoannulation Induced by the Dual Lewis Acidity of Alumina</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual Lewis acidity of &#947;&#8208;alumina is reported to enable rapid &#960;&#8208;extension of readily available building blocks through the tandem activation of &#8220;soft&#8221; triple C&#8722;C bonds and hard C&#8722;F bonds. The reaction gives facile access to elusive non&#8208;alternant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as &#960;&#8208;extended helicenes and geodesic carbon nanoribbon fragments.







Abstract
We have discovered a dual (i.&#8201;e., soft and hard) Lewis acidity of alumina that enables rapid one&#8208;pot &#960;&#8208;extension through the activation of terminal alkynes followed by C&#8722;F activation. The tandem reaction introduces an acenaphthene fragment &#8211; an essential moiety of geodesic polyarenes. This reaction provides quick access to elusive non&#8208;alternant polyarenes such as &#960;&#8208;extended buckybowls and helicenes through three&#8208;point annulation of the 1&#8208;(2&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;6&#8208;fluorophenyl)naphthalene moiety. The versatility of the developed method was demonstrated by the synthesis of unprecedented structural fragments of elusive geodesic graphene nanoribbons.

         <title>Anomeric Stereoauxiliary Cleavage of the C&#8722;N Bond of d&#8208;Glucosamine for the Preparation of Imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines</title>

The G&#228;nseliesel showcases the scientific magic in G&#246;ttingen! Scientific magic on the &#945;&#8208;anomer of d&#8208;glucosamine helps the targeted cleavage of C&#8722;N bonds in d&#8208;glucosamine (&#945;&#8208;2&#176; amine) from biobased resources and the conjunction of nitrogen in the synthesis of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines. This new approach expands the scope of readily accessible imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines relative to existing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods. A key strategic advantage of this approach is that the &#945;&#8208;anomer of d&#8208;glucosamine enables C&#8722;N bond cleavage through a seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring transition state.

         <title>Chiral fibers formation upon assembly of tetraphenylalanine peptide conjugated to a PNA dimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly of biomolecules such as peptides, nucleic acids or their analogues affords supramolecular objects, exhibiting structures and physical properties dependent on the amino&#8208;acid or nucleobase composition. Conjugation of the peptide diphenylalanine (FF) to peptide nucleic acids triggers formation of self&#8208;assembled structures, mainly stabilized by interactions between FF. In this work we report formation of homogeneous chiral fibers upon self&#8208;assembly of the hybrid composed of the tetraphenylalanine peptide (4F) conjugated to the PNA dimer adenine&#8208;thymine (at). In this case nucleobases seem to play a key role in determining the morphology and chirality of the fibers. When the PNA &#8220;at&#8221; is replaced by guanine&#8208;cytosine dimer &#8220;gc&#8221;, disordered structures are observed. Spectroscopic characterization of the self&#8208;assembled hybrids, along with AFM and SEM studies is reported. Finally, a structural model consistent with the experimental evidences has also been obtained, showing how the building blocks of 4Fat arrange to give helical fibers.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The primary phosphines MesPH  2  and  t  &#8208;BuPH  2  react with 9&#8208;iodo&#8208;  m  &#8208;carborane yielding B9&#8208;connected secondary carboranylphosphines 1,7&#8208;H  2  C  2  B  10  H  9  &#8208;9&#8208;PHR, R = 2,4,6&#8208;Me  3  C  6  H  2  (Mes) (  1a  ),  t&#8208;  Bu (  1b  )). Addition of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (BCF) to  1a,b  resulted in the zwitterionic compounds 1,7&#8208;H  2  C  2  B  10  H  9  &#8208;9&#8208;PHR(  p  &#8208;C  6  F  4  )BF(C  6  F  5  )  2  (  2a,b  ) through nucleophilic  para  substitution of a C  6  F  5  ring followed by fluoride transfer to boron.

         <title>Efficient Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 to Formate in Methanol Solutions by Mn Functionalized Electrodes in the Presence of Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon cloth electrode modified by covalently attaching a manganese organometallic catalyst is used as cathode for the electrochemical reduction of CO  2  in methanol solutions. Six different industrial amines are employed as co&#8208;catalyst in millimolar concentrations to deliver a series of new reactive system. While such absorbents were so far believed to provide a CO  2  reservoir and act as sacrificial proton source, we herein demonstrate that this role can be played by methanol, and that the adduct formed between CO  2  and the amine can act as an effector or inhibitor toward the catalyst, thereby enhancing or reducing the production of formate. Pentamethyldiethylentriamine (  PMDETA),  identified as the best effector in our series, converts CO  2  in wet methanolic solution into bisammonium bicarbonate. Computational studies revealed that this adduct is responsible for a barrierless transformation of CO  2  to formate by the reduced form of the Mn catalyst covalently bonded to the electrode surface. As a consequence, selectivity can be switched on demand from CO to formate anion, and in the case of (  PMDETA  ) an impressive TON  HCOO&#8211;  of 2.8&#215;10  4  can be reached. This new valuable knowledge on an integrated capture and utilization system paves the way toward more efficient transformation of CO  2  into liquid fuel.</dc:description>

         <title>Identifying the Molecular Origins of Green BN&#8208;TADF Material Degradation and Device Stability via In&#8208;situ Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is little investigation into the impact of molecular conformation on device efficiency and degradation of boron&#8208;nitrogen thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters (BN&#8208;TADF). Herein, three highly&#8208;efficient green BN&#8208;TADF emitters have been designed to unveil the impact of peripheral phenyl groups on device efficiencies and lifetimes. Compared to BN&#8208;PhOH with the lowest EQE max of 19%, BN&#8208;PhOCH 3 and BN&#8208;PhN(CH 3 ) 2 have achieved strongly enhanced EQE max of 25.6% and 24.1%, respectively. Importantly, the device lifetimes (LT 50 ) are dramatically improved from 1.7 h of BN&#8208;PhOH to 4.4 h of BN&#8208;PhOCH 3 and 7.7 h of BN&#8208;PhN(CH 3 ) 2 without encapsulation. According to in&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy and simulations, BN&#8208;PhN(CH 3 ) 2 of less conformation change after aging exhibits the best photostability. We proposed the torsion angle change between the BN core and the peripheral phenyl group results in BN&#8208;TADF degradation. This knowledge means precisely tuning peripheral groups of BN&#8208;TADF can achieve both higher device efficiencies and longer lifetimes.</dc:description>

         <title>Impact of N&#8208;aryl&#8208; and NHC core&#8208;substituents on the coupling of alkylzinc nucleophiles: Is bigger always better?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bulky Pd&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysts (e.g., N&#8208;(di&#8208;2,6&#8208;(3&#8208;pentyl)phenyl),&#160;IPent) have been shown to have significantly higher reactivity in a wide variety of cross&#8208;coupling applications (i.e., C&#8208;C, C&#8208;S, C&#8208;N) than less hindered variants (e.g., N&#8208;(di&#8208;2,6&#8208;(isopropyl)phenyl),&#160;IPr). Further, chlorinating the backbone of the NHC ring sees and even greater increase in reactivity. In the cross&#8208;coupling of (hetero)aryl electrophiles to secondary alkyl nucleophiles, making the N&#8208;aryl groups larger reduces the amount of&#160;b&#8208;hydride elimination leading to alkene byproducts and chlorinating the NHC core had an even greater effect, all but eliminating alkene formation. In this study involving the cross&#8208;coupling of&#160;1&#186;alkyl electrophiles and nucleophiles, a sharp and surprising reversal of all of the above trends was observed. Bulkier catalysts had generally slower rate of reaction and&#160;b&#8208;hydride elimination worsened leading to extensive amounts of alkene byproducts.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Step Dielectric Responsive Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Material with Mid&#8208;Band Light Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic perovskite (HOIP) have received tremendous scientific attention because of the phase transition and photovoltaic properties. However, achieving the special perovskite structure with both two&#8208;step dielectric response and luminescence characteristics is rarely reported. Herein, we report an organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite, [(BA)  2  &#11827;PbI  4  ] ( BA = n&#8208;butylamine) by introducing flexible organic cations (HBA  +  ), with direct mid&#8208;band gap as 2.28 eV. Interestingly, this material exhibits two&#8208;step reversible dielectric response at 350 K and 460 K (in heating process), respectively. Besides, the photoluminescence was found: it emits charming green light under 365 nm lamp (Photoluminescence quantum yield is 9.52 %). The outstanding two&#8208;step dielectric response and luminescence characteristics of this compound might pave the way for the application of dielectric and ferroelectric functional materials in temperature sensors and mechanical switches</dc:description>

         <title>Deposition of Vertically Aligned Ag/Ag2S Nanoflakes on EGaIn Particles for Humidity Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Core&#8211;shell EGaIn/Ag particles were prepared in an ultrasonication assisted galvanic replacement reaction, and were subsequently transformed into EGaIn/Ag/Ag2S by a partial sulfurization. A humidity sensor based on the EGaIn/Ag/Ag2S particles showed superior sensing response to EGaIn and EGaIn/Ag due to the silver sulfide in the composites; two conduction mechanisms take place simultaneously.







Abstract
Liquid metals, which possess both good electrical conductivity and liquid&#8208;like processability, have drawn much attention recently. They are also capable of acting as synthesis templates to guide the deposition of other functional materials. Herein, through an in&#8208;situ galvanic replacement reaction assisted by ultrasonication, core&#8211;shell EGaIn/Ag particles composed of EGaIn cores and vertically aligned Ag nanoflakes as shells were prepared; they were further sulfurized to yield ternary EGaIn/Ag/Ag2S core&#8211;shell composite particles. A humidity sensor based on EGaIn/Ag/Ag2S particles showed much higher sensing response than EGaIn and EGaIn/Ag. Such superior performance could be attributed to the n&#8208;type semiconducting character of Ag2S allowing it to receive electrons from water molecules at low humidity, and its highly hydrophilic surface allowing it to absorb more water molecules at higher humidity so as to enable the formation of ion&#8208;conductive paths.

&lt;p&gt;Liquid metals, which possess both good electrical conductivity and liquid-like processability, have drawn much attention recently. They are also capable of acting as synthesis templates to guide the deposition of other functional materials. Herein, through an in-situ galvanic replacement reaction assisted by ultrasonication, core&#8211;shell EGaIn/Ag particles composed of EGaIn cores and vertically aligned Ag nanoflakes as shells were prepared; they were further sulfurized to yield ternary EGaIn/Ag/Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S core&#8211;shell composite particles. A humidity sensor based on EGaIn/Ag/Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S particles showed much higher sensing response than EGaIn and EGaIn/Ag. Such superior performance could be attributed to the n-type semiconducting character of Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S allowing it to receive electrons from water molecules at low humidity, and its highly hydrophilic surface allowing it to absorb more water molecules at higher humidity so as to enable the formation of ion-conductive paths.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>pH&#8208;Triggered Removal of Nitrogenous Organic Micropollutants from Water by Using Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra</title>

MOPping up micropollutants: A new pH&#8208;triggered pollutant&#8208;removal methodology that uses water&#8208;soluble metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOPs) as coordinative capturing agents removes nitrogenous organic micropollutants from water. The exohedral coordination positions in the MOP structure are harnessed to coordinatively sequester the coordinating pollutants, while the exposed surface carboxyl groups are used to control their solubility in water through acid/base reactions. Benzotriazole (BT), benzothiazole (BTZ), 1&#8208;napthylamine (NA) and isoquinoline (IQ) were selected to validate this methodology.







Abstract
Water pollution threatens human and environmental health worldwide. Thus, there is a pressing need for new approaches to water purification. Herein, we report a novel supramolecular strategy based on the use of a metal&#8208;organic polyhedron (MOP) as a capture agent to remove nitrogenous organic micropollutants from water, even at very low concentrations (ppm), based exclusively on coordination chemistry at the external surface of the MOP. Specifically, we exploit the exohedral coordination positions of RhII&#8208;MOP to coordinatively sequester pollutants bearing N&#8208;donor atoms in aqueous solution, and then harness their exposed surface carboxyl groups to control their aqueous solubility through acid/base reactions. We validated this approach for removal of benzotriazole, benzothiazole, isoquinoline, and 1&#8208;napthylamine from water.

         <title>Hierarchical Fibrous Honeycomb Ceramics with High Load Capability and Low Light&#8208;Off Temperature for the Next&#8208;Generation Auto Emissions Standards</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new 3D microarchitecture as a backbone to support the catalyst was prepared by combing with the synergy of high&#8208;strength ceramic fibers and ultrathin TiO2 nanosheets. The honeycomb ceramic exhibits a high volume&#8208;specific surface area of 3.59&#215;104&#8197;cm2/cm3, a compressive strength of 2.01&#8197;MPa. It also delivered a low light&#8208;off temperature of 150&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Novel and stringent automotive exhaust gas emissions standards are urgently needed to counter the problems posed by the worsening global climate and environment. However, the traditional cordierite&#8208;based honeycomb ceramics substrates with ultimate pore density have seriously restricted the establishment of new emission standards. Herein, we introduce a novel robust substrate with tailored volume&#8208;specific surface area and low heat capacity. This substrate employs the synergy of high&#8208;strength ceramic fibers and ultrathin TiO2 nanosheets. The micro&#8208;sized fibers provide support to ensure structural strength during the catalytic reaction, while the nanosheets play the dual role of connecting the fibers and providing a high surface area for catalyst immobilization. The new three&#8208;dimensional (3D) microarchitecture exhibits a high volume&#8208;specific surface area of 3.59&#215;104&#8197;cm2/cm3, a compressive strength of 2.01&#8197;MPa, and remarkable stability after high&#8208;speed air erosion at 800&#8201;&#176;C. The honeycomb&#8208;like structure exhibit low resistance to gas flow. Furthermore, after loading with Pt and Pd nanoparticles, the composite 3D microarchitecture delivered an excellent catalytic performance and prominent structural stability, with a super low light&#8208;off temperature of 150&#8201;&#176;C. The outstanding mechanical and thermal stability and the high surface area and light&#8208;off temperature of the new substrate indicate its potential for use as a highly efficient catalytic carrier to meet the next&#8208;generation auto emissions standards.

         <title>Reversible and stepwise single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation of a platinum(II) complex with vapochromic luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The vapochromic single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transformation of a highly luminescent Pt(II) complex bearing an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene [Pt(CN)  2  (  t  Bu&#8208;impy)] (  t  Bu&#8208;impyH  +  = 1&#8208;  t  &#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1  H  &#8208;imidazolium) was reported. The trihydrate form of the complex, that exhibits blue  3  MMLCT emission owing to weak Pt&#183;&#183;&#183;Pt interactions, changed its luminescence color from blue to yellowish&#8208;green upon the desorption of water molecules keeping the high emission quantum yield more than 0.6. Variable&#8208;temperature and continuous in&#8208;situ tracking of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements revealed that the SCSC transformation proceeds reversibly by the release and reabsorption of water molecules changing the stacked structure slightly. As a result, the dynamics of vapor&#8208;induced SCSC transformation were elucidated that the anhydrous form returned to the original trihydrate form in a two&#8208;step process under a water vapor atmosphere. In addition, the Pt(II) complex exhibited a similar SCSC response accompanied by a luminescence color change in the presence of methanol vapor, while being inactive toward ethanol vapor.</dc:description>

         <title>A Mesoionic Diselenolene Anion and the Corresponding Radical Dianion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Being mesoionic makes the difference: A diselenolene ligand with fundamentally different electronic properties compared to a normal diselenolene is reported. Two stable redox states are accessible: a paramagnetic radical dianion and a diamagnetic monoanion. The ligand was used for the preparation of novel aluminum bis&#8208; and tris(diselenolene) complexes.







Abstract
Dichalcogenolenes are archetypal redox non&#8208;innocent ligands with numerous applications. Herein, a diselenolene ligand with fundamentally different electronic properties is described. A mesoionic diselenolene was prepared by selenation of a C2&#8208;protected imidazolium salt. This ligand is diamagnetic, which is in contrast to the paramagnetic nature of standard dichalcogenolene monoanions. The new ligand is also redox&#8208;active, as demonstrated by isolation of a stable diselenolene radical dianion. The unique electronic properties of the new ligand give rise to unusual coordination chemistry. Thus, preparation of a hexacoordinate aluminum tris(diselenolene) complex and a Lewis acidic aluminate complex with two ligand&#8208;centered unpaired electrons was achieved.

         <title>1,2&#8208;Carboboration of Arylallenes by In Situ Generated Alkenylboranes for the Synthesis of 1,4&#8208;Dienes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemo&#8208; and regioselective 1,2&#8208;carboboration of arylallenes by alkenylboranes, formed in&#8197;situ by hydroboration of alkynes with Piers&#8217; borane (HB(C6F5)2) is reported. This novel 1,2&#8208;carboboration and a subsequent Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling were used for the synthesis of twenty new aryl substituted 1,4&#8208;dienes.







Abstract
We herein report a novel method for the coupling of unactivated alkynes and arylallenes, which relies on an unprecedented and regioselective 1,2&#8208;carboboration of the allene by an alkenylborane. The alkenylborane is conveniently prepared in&#8197;situ by hydroboration of an alkyne with Piers&#8217; borane, i.&#8201;e., HB(C6F5)2. The boryl&#8208;substituted 1,4&#8208;dienes that are formed by this carboboration are well&#8208;suited for a subsequent Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling with aryl iodides. This allowed us to develop a three&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot protocol for the synthesis of aryl&#8208;substituted 1,4&#8208;dienes. The generality of the reaction was demonstrated by the synthesis of twenty dienes with modular variations of all three reaction partners. The mechanism of the new 1,2&#8208;carboboration was investigated using dispersion corrected double&#8208;hybrid DFT computations that allowed us to rationalize the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity of this key step.

The generality of the reaction was demonstrated by the synthesis of twenty dienes with modular variations of all three reaction partners. The mechanism of the new 1,2-carboboration was investigated using dispersion corrected double-hybrid DFT computations that allowed us to rationalize the chemo- and regioselectivity of this key step.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Constructing Atomic Fe and N Co&#8208;doped Hollow Carbon Nanospheres with a Polymer Encapsulation Strategy for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries with Accelerated Polysulfide Conversion</title>

         <dc:description>
A polymer encapsulation strategy is designed to synthesize atomic Fe and N co&#8208;doped hollow carbon nanospheres (Fe&#8722;NHC) with Fe&#8722;Nx sites for modifying commercial PP separator of LSBs to suppress the shuttle effect and promote the sluggish kinetics of intermediate polysulfides. Therefore, the battery with the Fe&#8722;NHC/PP separator delivers outstanding cycling and rate performances. Even at a harsh current density of 4&#8197;C, a high capacity of 824&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 is achieved, indicating the superiority of the Fe&#8208;NHC/PP separator in LSBs.







Abstract
As competitive next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries, lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs) suffer from the shuttle effect and the sluggish kinetics of intermediate polysulfides during charge and discharge processes, adversely affecting their electrochemical performances and actual applications. Herein, we demonstrate a polymer encapsulation strategy to synthesize atomic Fe and N co&#8208;doped hollow carbon nanospheres (Fe&#8722;NHC) with Fe&#8722;Nx sites for modifying commercial PP separator of LSBs to suppress the shuttle effect and promote the kinetics of intermediate polysulfides. Benefiting from the excellent structural design, the doped&#8208;N with positive charges could effectively adsorb negatively charged soluble polysulfides, help attract the soluble polysulfides to the Fe atoms and boost the catalytic transformation of the soluble polysulfides. Additionally, such a thin carbon shell could provide a short mass diffusion pathway and hence promote the adsorption and the catalytic conversion. Therefore, the battery with the Fe&#8722;NHC/PP separator delivers outstanding cycling and rate performances. At the large current density of 1&#8197;C, the specific capacity is 1079&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 and maintains a low loss of 0.076&#8201;% per cycle within 500&#8197;cycles. Even at a harsh current density of 4&#8197;C, a high capacity of 824&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 is still achieved, indicating the advantage of the Fe&#8722;NHC/PP separator in LSBs.

         <title>Halogenation of the Hexaphosphabenzene Complex [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;,&#951;6:&#951;6&#8208;P6)]: Snapshots on the Reaction Progress</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Snapshots on the halogenation of the hexaphosphabenzene complex [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;,&#951;6:&#951;6&#8208;P6)] show the plethora of complexes that are formed, resulting from the initial halogenation of the P6 ligand. Among them, with iodine, a compound with six P atoms still present could be obtained, directly at room temperature. With the more aggressive bromine and chlorine, the P6 unit degrades to an allylic P3 unit but phosphorus rich compounds could also be isolated.







Abstract
The oxidation of [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;,&#951;6:&#951;6&#8208;P6)] (1) with halogens or halogen sources was investigated. The iodination afforded the ionic complexes [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;,&#951;3:&#951;3&#8208;P3)(&#956;,&#951;1:&#951;1:&#951;1:&#951;1&#8208;P3I3)][X] (X=I3&#8722;, I&#8722;) (2) and [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;,&#951;4:&#951;4&#8208;P4)(&#956;&#8208;PI2)][I3] (3), while the reaction with PBr5 led to the complexes [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;,&#951;3:&#951;3&#8208;P3)(&#956;&#8208;Br)2][Cp*MoBr4] (4) [(Cp*MoBr)2(&#956;,&#951;3:&#951;3&#8208;P3)(&#956;,&#951;1&#8208;P2Br3)] (5) and [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;&#8208;PBr2)(&#956;&#8208;PHBr)(&#956;&#8208;Br)2] (6). The reaction of 1 with the far stronger oxidizing agent PCl5 was followed via time&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent 31P{1H} NMR spectroscopy. One of the first intermediates detected at 193&#8197;K was [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;,&#951;3:&#951;3&#8208;P3)(&#956;&#8208;PCl2)2][PCl6] (8) which rearranges upon warming to [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;&#8208;PCl2)2(&#956;&#8208;Cl)2] (9), [(Cp*MoCl)2(&#956;,&#951;3:&#951;3&#8208;P3)(&#956;&#8208;PCl2)] (10) and [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;,&#951;4:&#951;4&#8208;P4)(&#956;&#8208;PCl2)][Cp*MoCl4] (11), which could be isolated at room temperature. All complexes were characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, NMR spectroscopy and their electronic structures were elucidated by DFT calculations.

Abstract
Surface plasmon of coinage metal nanostructures has been employed as a powerful route in boosting the performances in heterogenous catalysis. Development of efficient plasmonic nanocatalysts with high catalytic performance and efficient light harvesting properties is of vital importance. Herein, we rationally designed and synthesized a plasmonic nanocatalyst composed of Au&#8208;framed Pd nanocubes by an Ag(I)&#8208;assisted seed&#8208;mediated growth method. In the synthesis, the incorporation of Ag(I) suppresses the reduction of Au on the {100} surface of cubic Pd seeds and leads to the formation of Au nanoframes on the Pd nanocubes. The unique Au&#8208;framed Pd nanocubes can integrate the superior electrocatalytic of Pd and the outstanding plasmonic properties of Au. Thus, these nanostructures were employed as plasmonic nanocatalysts for plasmon&#8208;enhanced electrocatalytic oxidation of ethanol with improved stability.

         <title>Reactions of a Four&#8208;Membered Borete with Carbon, Silicon, and Gallium Donor Ligands: Fused and Spiro&#8208;Type Boracycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A four&#8208;membered naphthalene&#8208;supported borete is investigated as a masked 1,4&#8208;dipolar donor&#8208;acceptor cyclobutane. Ring expansion reactions confirm such type of reactivity and afford complex cyclic structures including fused and spiro&#8208;type polycyclics.







Abstract
Donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes or cyclobutanes are dipolar reagents, which are widely used in the synthesis of complex organic (hetero)cycles in ring expansion reactions. Applying this concept to boron containing heterocycles, the four&#8208;membered borete cyclo&#8208;iPr2N&#8208;BC10H6 reacted with the carbon donor ligands 2,6&#8208;xylylisonitrile and the carbene IMes :C(NMesCH)2 with ring expansion and ring fusion, respectively. In particular, the tetracyclic structure formed with IMes displays zwitterionic character and absorption in the visible region. In contrast to the carbene IMes, the heavier carbenoids :Si(NDippCH)2 and :Ga(AmIm) with a two&#8208;coordinate donor atom afford spiro&#8208;type bicyclic compounds, which display four&#8208;coordinate geometry at silicon or gallium. (TD&#8208;)DFT calculations provide deeper insight into the mechanism of formation and the absorption properties of these new compounds.

A core&#8208;shell heterogeneous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) hybrid is sequentially designed by a photosensitized porous coordination network (PCN)&#8208;typed MOF as core and Cu2+&#8208;centered zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF&#8208;67) as shell encapsulating cyanine 3&#8208;labelled siRNA.

         <title>Renaissance of Topotactic Ion&#8208;Exchange for Functional Solids with Close Packed Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topotactic cation exchange on close&#8208;packed structures has recently emerged as a potent synthetic tactic for the preparation of many new functional solids. A synergistic blending of new functionality to an underlying three&#8208;dimensional structure can be achieved that, in many cases, yields a unique pathway to metastable solids with new and/or enhanced properties, such as for visible&#8208;light photocatalysts. For example, shown is the new semiconductor photocatalyst SZT (SnZr1/2Ti1/2O3) as a nano&#8208;shell on BZT (BaZr1/2Ti1/2O3).







Abstract
Recently, many new, complex, functional oxides have been discovered with the surprising use of topotactic ion&#8208;exchange reactions on close&#8208;packed structures, such as found for wurtzite, rutile, perovskite, and other structure types. Despite a lack of apparent cation&#8208;diffusion pathways in these structure types, synthetic low&#8208;temperature transformations are possible with the interdiffusion and exchange of functional cations possessing ns2 stereoactive lone pairs (e.&#8201;g., Sn(II)) or unpaired ndx electrons (e.&#8201;g., Co(II)), targeting new and favorable modulations of their electronic, magnetic, or catalytic properties. This enables a synergistic blending of new functionality to an underlying three&#8208;dimensional connectivity, i.&#8201;e., [&#8208;M&#8722;O&#8208;M&#8208;O&#8208;]n, that is maintained during the transformation. In many cases, this tactic represents the only known pathway to prepare thermodynamically unstable solids that otherwise would commonly decompose by phase segregation, such as that recently applied to the discovery of many new small bandgap semiconductors.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of An Aluminosilicate POS Zeolite with Intersecting 12&#215;11&#215;11&#8208;Member&#8208;Ring Pore Channels by Using a Designed Organic Structure&#8208;Directing Agent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Large and extra&#8208;large pore zeolites have been widely applied in industrial areas as catalysts, adsorbents, etc. Among them, silica and/or aluminosilicate zeolites have been attracted great attention due to their excellent hydrothermal stability and strong acidity. However, a great deal of zeolite structures are still not available in the form of silica and/or aluminosilicate. Herein, we report the synthesis of pure silica and aluminosilicate large&#8208;pore zeolites, denoted as NUD&#8208;14 and Al&#8208;NUD&#8208;14, respectively, by using a designed cation 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;4&#8208;phenylpyridinium as an organic structure&#8208;directing agent (OSDA). NUD&#8208;14 has an intersecting 12&#215;11&#215;11&#8208;member ring pore system, which is isostructural to the germanosilicate PUK&#8208;16 zeolite with a POS topology. The OSDAs can be completely removed from the framework by calcination. NUD&#8208;14 and Al&#8208;NUD&#8208;14 possess excellent acid and hydrothermal stabilities, superior to the germanosilicate POS zeolite. The incorporation of Al into the zeolite framework makes the Al&#8208;NUD&#8208;14 zeolite possess medium and strong acidities. The successful synthesis of NUD&#8208;14 consisting of a rare odd&#8208;membered ring pore structure may provide a platform for interesting size&#8208; and shape&#8208;selective catalytic applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The activation of C&#8211;Br bonds in various bromoalkanes by the biradical [  &#8226;  P(  &#956;  &#8208;NTer)  2  P  &#8226;  ] (  1  ) (Ter = 2,6&#8208;bis&#8208;(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)&#8208;phenyl) is reported, yielding  trans  &#8208;addition products of the type [Br&#8208;P(  &#956;  &#8208;NTer)  2  P&#8208;R] (  2  ), so&#8208;called 1,3&#8208;substituted  cyclo  &#8208;1,3&#8208;diphospha&#8208;2,4&#8208;diazanes. This addition reaction, which represents a new easy approach to asymmetrically substituted  cyclo  &#8208;1,3&#8208;diphospha&#8208;2,4&#8208;diazanes, was investigated mechanistically by different spectroscopic methods (NMR, EPR, IR, Raman) as well as X&#8208;ray diffraction, suggesting a stepwise radical reaction mechanism, as evidenced by the  in&#8208;situ  detection of the phosphorus&#8208;centered monoradical [  &#8226;  P(  &#956;  &#8208;NTer)  2  P&#8208;R]. To provide further evidence for the radical mechanism, [  &#8226;  P(  &#956;  &#8208;NTer)  2  P&#8208;Et] (  3Et  &#8226;  ) was synthesized directly by reduction of the bromoethane addition product [Br&#8208;P(  &#956;  &#8208;NTer)  2  P&#8208;Et] (  2a  ) with magnesium, resulting in the formation of the new persistent phosphorus&#8208;centered monoradical [  &#8226;  P(  &#956;  &#8208;NTer)  2  P&#8208;Et], which could be isolated and fully characterized. Comparison of the EPR spectrum of the radical intermediate in the addition reaction with that of the synthesized new [  &#8226;  P(  &#956;  &#8208;NTer)  2  P&#8208;Et] radical clearly proves the existen&#173;ce of radicals in the course of the reaction of biradical [  &#8226;  P(  &#956;  &#8208;NTer)  2  P  &#8226;  ] (  1  ) with bromoethane. Extensive DFT and coupled cluster calculations corroborate the experimental data for a radical mechanism in the reaction of biradical [  &#8226;  P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)  2  P  &#8226;  ] with EtBr. In the field of hetero&#8208;cyclobutane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyls, the demonstration of a stepwise radical reac&#173;tion represents a new aspect and closes the gap between P&#8208;centered biradicals and P&#8208;centered monoradicals in terms of radical reactivity.</dc:description>

This addition reaction, which represents a new easy approach to asymmetrically substituted  cyclo  -1,3-diphospha-2,4-diazanes, was investigated mechanistically by different spectroscopic methods (NMR, EPR, IR, Raman) as well as X-ray diffraction, suggesting a stepwise radical reaction mechanism, as evidenced by the  in-situ  detection of the phosphorus-centered monoradical [  &#8226;  P(  &#956;  -NTer)  2  P-R]. To provide further evidence for the radical mechanism, [  &#8226;  P(  &#956;  -NTer)  2  P-Et] (  3Et  &#8226;  ) was synthesized directly by reduction of the bromoethane addition product [Br-P(  &#956;  -NTer)  2  P-Et] (  2a  ) with magnesium, resulting in the formation of the new persistent phosphorus-centered monoradical [  &#8226;  P(  &#956;  -NTer)  2  P-Et], which could be isolated and fully characterized. Comparison of the EPR spectrum of the radical intermediate in the addition reaction with that of the synthesized new [  &#8226;  P(  &#956;  -NTer)  2  P-Et] radical clearly proves the existen&#173;ce of radicals in the course of the reaction of biradical [  &#8226;  P(  &#956;  -NTer)  2  P  &#8226;  ] (  1  ) with bromoethane. Extensive DFT and coupled cluster calculations corroborate the experimental data for a radical mechanism in the reaction of biradical [  &#8226;  P(&#956;-NTer)  2  P  &#8226;  ] with EtBr. In the field of hetero-cyclobutane-1,3-diyls, the demonstration of a stepwise radical reac&#173;tion represents a new aspect and closes the gap between P-centered biradicals and P-centered monoradicals in terms of radical reactivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Measurements and Utilization of Consistent Gibbs Energies of Transfer of Single Ions: Towards a Unified Redox Potential Scale for All Solvents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Utilizing the &#8220;ideal&#8221; ionic liquid salt bridge for measurements of Gibbs energies of transfer of silver ions between the solvents water, acetonitrile, propylene carbonate and dimethylformamide results in a consistent data set with a precision of 0.6 kJ mol  &#8722;1  over 87 measurements in 10 half&#8208;cells. This forms the basis for a coherent experimental thermodynamic framework of ion solvation chemistry. In addition, we define the solvent independent pe  abs  H2O  &#8208; and the  E  abs  H2O  &#8208;values that account for the electronating potential of any redox system similar to the pH  abs  H2O  &#8208;value of a medium that accounts for its protonating potential. This  E  abs  H2O  &#8208;scale is thermodynamically well&#8208;defined enabling the straightforward comparability of the redox potentials (reducities) of all media with respect to the aqueous redox potential scale, hence unifying all conventional solvent&#180;s redox potential scales. Thus, using the herein published Gibbs energy of transfer of the silver ion one can convert and unify all hitherto published redox potentials measured for example against ferrocene to the  E  abs  H2O  &#8208;scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Irreversible Inhibition of IspG, a Target for the Development of New Antimicrobials, by a 2&#8208;Vinyl Analogue of its MEcPP Substrate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A substrate analogue of MEcPP, a key intermediate in the MEP pathway, has been synthesized. The target compound features a vinyl functionality in place of the natural methyl substituent. Potent irreversible inhibition towards GcpE (IspG) was observed. Introduction of a double bond allows conjugation in the putative reactive intermediates while entering enzymatic transformation. Unexpected covalent trapping could happen as consequential damage.







Abstract
IspG (also called GcpE) is an oxygen&#8208;sensitive [4Fe&#8208;4S] enzyme catalyzing the penultimate step of the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, a validated target for drug development. It converts 2&#8208;C&#8208;methyl&#8208;d&#8208;erythritol&#8208;2,4&#8208;cyclo&#8208;diphosphate (MEcPP) into (E)&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;but&#8208;2&#8208;enyl&#8208;1&#8208;diphosphate (HMBPP). The reaction, assimilated to a reductive dehydration, involves redox partners responsible for the formal transfer of two electrons to substrate MEcPP. The 2&#8208;vinyl analogue of MEcPP was designed to generate conjugated species during enzyme catalysis, with the aim of providing new reactive centers to be covalently trapped by neighboring amino acid residues. The synthesized substrate analogue displayed irreversible inhibition towards IspG. Furthermore, we have shown that electron transfer occurs prior to inhibition; this might designate conjugated intermediates as probable affinity tags through covalent interaction at the catalytic site. This is the first report of an irreversible inhibitor of the IspG metalloenzyme.

         <title>&#947;&#8208;Resorcyclic Acid&#8208;Based AIEgens for Illuminating Endoplasmic Reticulum**

Illuminate ER: Two small molecules with &#947;&#8208;resorcyclic acid moiety were designed and synthesized having aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) activity due to dual intramolecular H&#8208;bonding. These small molecules localized into the sub&#8208;cellular endoplasmic reticulum to light it up.







Abstract
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has emerged as one of the interesting sub&#8208;cellular organelles due to its role in myriads of biological phenomena. Subsequently, visualization of the structure&#8208;function and dynamics of ER remained a major challenge to understand its involvement in different diseased states including cancer. To illuminate the ER, herein we have designed and synthesized &#947;&#8208;resorcyclic acid&#8208;based small molecules, which showed remarkable aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) property in water. This AIE property was originated from the dual intramolecular H&#8208;bonding leading to the self&#8208;assembled 2D aggregation confirmed by pH&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent fluorescence quenching studies as well as scanning electron microscopy. These small molecules illuminated the sub&#8208;cellular ER in HeLa cervical cancer cells as well as non&#8208;cancerous RPE&#8208;1 human retinal epithelial cells within 1&#8197;h. These novel small molecules have the potential to light up ER chemical biology in diseased states.

         <title>Exploring the Biosynthetic Potential of TsrM, a B12&#8208;dependent Radical SAM Methyltransferase Catalyzing Non&#8208;radical Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TsrM is a B12&#8208;dependent radical SAM enzyme catalyzing methylation reactions from carbon&#8208;atoms to nucleophilic atoms making it a unique and versatile alkylating agent. TsrM is able to directly transfer methyl groups on the less reactive carbon atom of the indole ring and to install several methyl groups on its substrate. TsrM has thus unique properties among radical SAM enzymes by notably catalyzing non&#8208;radical reactions. (SAM: S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine).







Abstract
B12&#8208;dependent radical SAM enzymes are an emerging enzyme family with approximately 200,000 proteins. These enzymes have been shown to catalyze chemically challenging reactions such as methyl transfer to sp2&#8208; and sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms. However, to date we have little information regarding their complex mechanisms and their biosynthetic potential. Here we show, using X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, mutagenesis and synthetic probes that the vitamin B12&#8208;dependent radical SAM enzyme TsrM catalyzes not only C&#8208; but also N&#8208;methyl transfer reactions further expanding its synthetic versatility. We also demonstrate that TsrM has the unique ability to directly transfer a methyl group to the benzyl core of tryptophan, including the least reactive position C4. Collectively, our study supports that TsrM catalyzes non&#8208;radical reactions and establishes the usefulness of radical SAM enzymes for novel biosynthetic schemes including serial alkylation reactions at particularly inert C&#8722;H bonds.

         <title>Several Key Factors for Efficient Electrocatalytic Water Splitting: Active Site Coordination Environment, Morphology Changes and Intermediates Identification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water&#8208;splitting has emerged as a promising alternative strategy to produce clean hydrogen fuel. However, current electrocatalytic water splitting suffers from sluggish kinetics, thus developing efficient electrocatalysts is crucial. Identifying reaction centers discloses the reaction mechanism and will undoubtedly facilitate the design and optimization of efficient water splitting electrocatalysts. This review summarizes several advances involving the identification of the actual active sites and intermediates capture on the catalytic surface. The morphology and valence states change on 2D materials are chose to illustrate how structural evolution affect catalytic activity. Specifically, in situ/ex situ electron microscopy techniques that used for the characterization of catalytic sites, and spectroscopy techniques that used to detect active intermediates at the molecular level are highlighted. In addition, several perspectives, such as the development of new in&#8208;situ techniques and electrokinetic analysis methods, are emphasized to shed light on future research.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoactivatable V&#8208;Shaped Bifunctional Quinone Methide Precursors as a New Class of Selective G&#8208;quadruplex Alkylating Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Combining the selectivity of G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) ligands with the spatial and temporal control of photochemistry is an emerging strategy to elucidate the biological relevance of these structures. In this work, we developed six novel V&#8208;shaped G4 ligands that can, upon irradiation, form stable covalent adducts with G4 structures via the reactive intermediate, quinone methide (QM). We thoroughly investigated the photochemical properties of the ligands and their ability to generate QMs. Subsequently, we analysed their specificity for various topologies of G4 and discovered a preferential binding towards the human telomeric sequence. Finally, we tested the ligand ability to act as photochemical alkylating agents, identifying the covalent adducts with G4 structures. This work introduces a novel molecular tool in the chemical biology toolkit for G4s.</dc:description>

         <title>Persulfurated Benzene&#8208;Cored Asterisks with &#960;&#8208;Extended ThioNaphthyl Arms: Synthesis, Structural, Photophysical and Covalent Dynamic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of regioisomeric asterisks (  5  ) and (  6  ) incorporating a benzene core with six 1&#8208;naphthylthio or six 2&#8208;naphthylthio arms are reported in search for new materials with optoelectronic properties. The consequences on the extension of a &#960; system surrounding a persulfurated benzene core provide a new avenue to study the structural, photophysical, and chemical properties of such family of all&#8208;organic phosphors. It also diverts the persulfuration mechanism after two radical cyclizations for making a [5]dithiohelicene by&#8208;product (  7  ), and favors dynamic sulfur component exchange reactions surrounding the core. These exchanges convert asterisks (  5  ) and (  6  ), non&#8208;phosphorescent at 20&#176;C to the highly phosphorescent (  4  ) (&#981; ~ 100%, solid state at 20&#176;C). For asterisks (  5  ) and (  6  ), the absence of the typical phosphorescence of the per(phenylthio)benzene core in the solid state at 20&#176;C and the presence of a weak naphthalene&#8208;based phosphorescence at 77 K is attributed to an energy transfer from the triplet state of the persulfurated benzene core to the outer naphthalene moieties, resulting in an antenna system.</dc:description>

         <title>How Ionization Catalyzes Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have studied the catalytic effect of ionization on the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between 1,3&#8208;butadiene and acrylaldehyde using relativistic density functional theory (DFT). Removal of an electron from the dienophile, acrylaldehyde, significantly accelerates the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction and shifts the reaction mechanism from concerted asynchronous for the neutral Diels&#8208;Alder reaction to stepwise for the radical&#8208;cation Diels&#8208;Alder reaction. Our detailed activation strain and Kohn&#8208;Sham molecular orbital analyses reveal how ionization of the dienophile enhances the Diels&#8208;Alder reactivity via two mechanisms: (i) by amplifying the asymmetry in the dienophile&#8217;s occupied p&#8208;orbitals to such an extent that the reaction goes from concerted asynchronous to stepwise and thus with substantially less steric (Pauli) repulsion per reaction step; (ii) by enhancing the stabilizing orbital interactions that result from the ability of the singly occupied molecular orbital of the radical&#8208;cation dienophile to engage in an additional three&#8208;electron bonding interaction with the highest occupied molecular orbital of the diene.</dc:description>

Our detailed activation strain and Kohn-Sham molecular orbital analyses reveal how ionization of the dienophile enhances the Diels-Alder reactivity via two mechanisms: (i) by amplifying the asymmetry in the dienophile&#8217;s occupied p-orbitals to such an extent that the reaction goes from concerted asynchronous to stepwise and thus with substantially less steric (Pauli) repulsion per reaction step; (ii) by enhancing the stabilizing orbital interactions that result from the ability of the singly occupied molecular orbital of the radical-cation dienophile to engage in an additional three-electron bonding interaction with the highest occupied molecular orbital of the diene.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Manipulation of triplet excited states in two&#8208;component systems for high&#8208;performance organic afterglow materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The past several years have witnessed tremendous development of novel chemical structures, new design strategies and intriguing applications in the field of room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and organic afterglow materials. This review focuses on recent advancements of high&#8208;performance organic afterglow materials obtained by two&#8208;component design strategies such as dopant&#8208;matrix strategy, donor&#8208;acceptor strategy, sensitization and energy transfer strategy. Based on some cutting&#8208;edge studies, organic afterglow efficiency has been largely improved, exceeding 90% in several cases. Organic afterglow durations reach tens of seconds in phosphorescence systems and hours in donor&#8208;acceptor systems. Organic afterglow brightness outcompetes some inorganic afterglow materials at the first several seconds after ceasing excitation source. Organic afterglow colors cover the whole visible regions and extend to near&#8208;infrared regions with respectful afterglow efficiency. On the basis of these achievements, researchers demonstrate promising applications of organic afterglow materials in diverse fields, which has also been reviewed.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescent Pyrrole&#8208;Based Phosphaphenalene Gold Complexes: Versatile Anticancer Tools with Wide Applicability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new gold standard: Pyrrole&#8208;based phosphaphenalene gold(I) complexes are potent anticancer agents with high efficacy against 14&#8197;different brain cancer cell lines derived from glioblastomas, brain metastases, meningiomas, IDH&#8208;mutant gliomas and head and neck cancers. The IC50 values reach concentrations as low as 730&#8197;nM. Furthermore, these versatile and tunable agents exhibit favorable optoelectronic properties giving rise to potential theranostic applications.







Abstract
Brain cancer, one of the most lethal diseases, urgently requires the discovery of novel theranostic agents. In this context, molecules based on six&#8208;membered phosphorus heterocycles &#8211; phosphaphenalenes &#8211; are especially attractive; they possess unique characteristics that allow precise chemical engineering. Herein, we demonstrate that subtle structural modifications of the phosphaphenalene&#8208;based gold(I) complexes lead to modify their electronic distribution, endow them with marked photophysical properties and enhance their efficacy against cancer. In particular, phosphaphenalene&#8208;based gold(I) complexes containing a pyrrole ring show antiproliferative properties in 14&#8197;cell lines including glioblastomas, brain metastases, meningiomas, IDH&#8208;mutant gliomas and head and neck cancers, reaching IC50 values as low as 0.73&#8197;&#956;M. The bioactivity of this new family of drugs in combination with their photophysical properties thus offer new research possibilities for both the fundamental investigation and treatment of brain cancer.

         <title>Controllable zeolite AST crystallization: between the classical and reversed crystal growth</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crystal growth mechanisms govern a wide range of properties of crystalline materials. Reversed crystal growth is one of the non&#8208;classical mechanisms observed in many materials. However, the reversed crystallization starting from amorphous aggregates and the key factors driving this growth remain elusive. Here, we describe a characteristic model of reversed crystal growth representing the inner structure and crystallinity development of aggregates studied by microscopy and nano X&#8208;ray computed tomography. By adjusting the synthesis conditions, the fundamental function of the structure&#8208;directing agent, which determines the crystallization pathway, was revealed. As a result, the crystal growth mode can be &amp;ldquo;switched&amp;rdquo; from the classical route at a low ratio of SDA/framework elements to reversed growth at a high ratio. Our findings provide further insights into crystal growth control, which is crucial for improving synthesis protocols and designing various forms of crystalline materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Red Light&#8208;Emitting Thermally&#8208;Activated Delayed Fluorescence of Naphthalimide&#8208;Phenoxazine Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Dyad: Time&#8208;Resolved Optical and Magnetic Spectroscopic Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We prepared an orthogonal compact electron&#8208;donor (phenoxazine, PXZ)&#8208;acceptor (naphthalimide, NI) dyad (  NI&#8208;PXZ  ), to study the photophysics of the thermally&#8208;activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), which has luminescence lifetime of 16.4 ns (99.2%)/17.0 &#956;s (0.80%). A weak charge transfer (CT) absorption band was observed for the dyad, indicating non&#8208;negligible electronic coupling between the donor and acceptor at ground state. Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy shows a fast charge separation (CS) (  ca.  2.02 &#8764; 2.72 ps), the majority of the singlet CS state is short&#8208;lived, especially in polar solvents (  &#964;  CR  = 10.3 ps in acetonitrile,  vs  . 1.83 ns in toluene, 7.81 ns in  n  &#8208;hexane). Nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy detects a long&#8208;lived transient species in  n  &#8208;hexane, which is with a mixed triplet mixed local excited state (  3  LE) and charge separated state (  3  CS), the lifetime is 15.4 &#956;s. In polar solvents, such as tetrahydrofuran and acetonitrile, a neat  3  CS state was observed, whose lifetimes are 226 ns and 142 ns, respectively. Time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectra indicate the existence of strongly spin exchanged  3  LE/  3  CT states, with the effective zero field splitting (ZFS) |  D  | and |  E  | parameters of 1484 MHz and 109 MHz, respectively, much smaller than that of the native  3  NI state (2475 and 135 MHz). It's rare but solid experimental evidence that a closely&#8208;lying  3  LE state is crucial for occurrence of TADF and this  3  LE state is an essential intermediate state to facilitate reverse ISC in TADF system.</dc:description>

         <title>Indole Editing Enabled by HFIP&#8208;Mediated Ring&#8208;Switch Reactions of 3&#8208;Amino&#8208;2&#8208;Hydroxyindolines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We found the novel reactivity of hemiaminal as a precursor for indole editing at the multi&#8208;site. The HFIP&#8208;promoted indole editing of indoline hemiaminals affords 2&#8208;arylindoles through a ring&#8208;switch sequence. The key to success of this transformation is to use a cyclic hemiaminal as an &#945;&#8208;amino aldehyde surrogate under transient tautomeric control. This transformation features mild reaction conditions and good yields with broad functional group tolerance. The utility of this indole editing is presented through the one&#8208;pot protocol and the synthesis of isocryptolepine.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Free Heterocyclic Carbon&#8208;Boron Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heteroaryl boronic acids and esters are extremely important and valuable intermediates because of their wide application in the synthesis of marketed drugs and bioactive compounds. Over the last couple of decades, the construction of highly important heteroaryl carbon&#8208;boron bonds has created huge attention. The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free protocols are more green, less sensitive to air and moisture, and also economically advantageous over the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based protocols. The transition metal&#8208;free C&#8208;H borylation of heteroarenes and C&#8208;X (X = halogen) borylation of heteroaryl halides represents an excellent approach for their synthesis. Also, various cyclization and alkyne activation protocols have been recently established for their synthesis. The goal of this review article is to summarize the existing literature and the current state of the art for transition metal&#8208;free synthesis of heteroaryl boronic acid and esters.</dc:description>

         <title>A Photoresponsive Receptor with a 105 Magnitude of Reversible Anion&#8208;Binding Switching</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new photoswitchable chromophore, the diiminoguanidinium group can be used as the base for an anion receptor based. Like the yin&#8208;yang (dark&#8211;light) relationship between the Moon and the Sun, the E,E and Z,Z photoisomers of the 2&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;diiminoguanidinium receptor have opposite binding behaviors towards sulfate, a representative oxyanion. The open E,E form binds sulfate with extraordinary strength in the dark, through chelating guanidinium hydrogen bonds. Upon photoisomerization to the Z,Z isomer, the anion&#8208;binding site is shut off, thereby ejecting the bound sulfate anion. More information can be found in the Research Article by B.&#8197;A. Moyer, R. Custelcean and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200719).

         <title>Disclosing Cyclic(Alkyl)(Amino)Carbenes as One&#8208;Electron Reductants: Synthesis of Acyclic(Amino)(Aryl)Carbene&#8208;Based Kekul&#233; Diradicaloids</title>

CAAC donates electron and acts as reductant: Cyclic(alkyl)(amino)(carbene) CAAC donates one electron during the formation of transient radical&#8208;cation evidenced by cyclic voltammetry and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Subsequently, the one electron&#8208;reductant property of the disclosed CAAC was used to synthesize acyclic(amino)(aryl)carbene&#8208;based Thiele and Chichibabin hydrocarbons. Notably, the acyclic(amino)(aryl)carbene&#8208;based Chichibabin's hydrocarbon shows an appreciable population of the triplet state at room temperature, as evidenced by both variable&#8208;temperature NMR and EPR spectroscopy.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose cyclic(alkyl)(amino)carbenes (CAACs) to be one&#8208;electron reductants under the formation of a transient radical cation as indicated by EPR spectroscopy. The disclosed CAAC reducing reactivity was used to synthesize acyclic(amino)(aryl)carbene&#8208;based Thiele and Chichibabin hydrocarbons, a new class of Kekul&#233; diradicaloids. The results demonstrate CAACs to be potent organic reductants. Notably, the acyclic(amino)(aryl)carbene&#8208;based Chichibabin's hydrocarbon shows an appreciable population of the triplet state at room temperature, as evidenced by both variable&#8208;temperature NMR and EPR spectroscopy.

         <title>Sterically Frustrated Aromatic Enes with Various Colors Originating from Multiple Folded and Twisted Conformations in Crystal Polymorphs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the crystalline state of sterically frustrated aromatic enes (FAEs) both twisted and folded carbon&#8211;carbon double bonds coexist. FAEs exhibit various absorption and emission colors from yellow to orange and from orange to dark red, just like beautiful autumn leaves. These color differences correspond to the multiple energetically close metastable conformations of the FAEs, which differ in the twist and fold angles of the C=C bond and the dihedral angle of the aryl unit relative to the C=C bond. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Nishiuchi, T. Kubo, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200286).

         <title>Lipid A mimetics based on unnatural disaccharide scaffold as potent TLR4 agonists for prospective immunotherapeutics and adjuvants</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>TLR4 is a key pattern recognition receptor that can sense pathogen&#8208; and danger&#8208; associated molecular patterns to activate the downstream signaling pathways which results in the upregulation of transcription factors and expression of interferons and cytokines to mediate protective pro&#8208;inflammatory responses involved in immune defense. Bacterial lipid A is the primary TLR4 ligand with very complex, species&#8208;specific, and barely predictable structure&#8208;activity relationships. Given that therapeutic targeting of TLR4 is an emerging tool for management of a variety of human diseases, the development of novel TLR4 activating biomolecules other than lipid A is of vast importance. We report on design, chemical synthesis and immunobiology of novel glycan&#8208;based lipid A&#8208;mimicking molecules that can activate human and murine TLR4&#8208;mediated signaling with picomolar affinity. Exploiting crystal structure &#8208; based design we have created novel disaccharide lipid A mimetics (DLAMs) where the inherently flexible &#946;(1&#8594;6)&#8208;linked diglucosamine backbone of lipid A is exchanged with a conformationally restrained non&#8208;reducing &#946;GlcN(1&#8596;1&#180;)&#946;GlcN scaffold. Excellent stereoselectivity in a challenging  &#946;,&#946;  &#8208;1,1&#180; glycosylation was achieved by tuning the reactivities of donor and acceptor molecules using protective group manipulation strategy. Divergent streamlined synthesis of &#946;,&#946;&#8208;1,1&#180;&#8208;linked diglucosamine&#8208;derived glycolipids entailing multiple long&#8208;chain (  R  )&#8208;3&#8208;  O  &#8208;acyloxyacyl residues and up two three phosphate groups was developed. Specific 3D&#8208;molecular shape and conformational rigidity of unnatural  &#946;,&#946;  &#8208;1,1&#180;&#8208;linked diglucosamine combined with carefully optimized phosphorylation and acylation pattern ensured efficient induction of the TLR4&#8208;mediated signaling in a species&#8208;independent manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Solid&#8208;phase peptide modification via deaminative photochemical Csp3&#8208;Csp3 bond formation using Katritzky salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Introduction of unnatural amino acids can significantly improve the binding affinity and stability of peptides. Commercial availability of such amino acids is limited, and their synthesis is a long and tedious process. We here describe a method that allows the functionalization of peptides directly on solid&#8208;support by converting lysine residues to Katritzky salts, and subjecting them to a photochemical Giese reaction under mild reaction conditions. The method avoids the need for amino acid synthesis and instead offers a late&#8208;stage modification route for rapid peptide diversification. While numerous modification approaches at the lysine amine have been described, this work provides the first example of deaminative functionalization of peptides at lysine. The two&#8208;step protocol is compatible with various substrates, lysine analogues, resins, and all proteinogenic amino acids. Finally, by leveraging solid&#8208;phase modification, this protocol facilitates the functionalization of longer peptides as was demonstrated using biologically relevant peptides of up to 15 amino acids.</dc:description>

         <title>A Quasi&#8208;Two&#8208;Dimensional Trilayered CsPbBr3&#8208;based Dion&#8722;Jacobson Hybrid Perovskite toward High&#8208;Performance Photodetection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (Q&#8208;2D) Dion&#8722;Jacobson (DJ) organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites based on CsPbBr3  are promising candidates for photodetection. Previous studies have predicted that the photoresponse of such materials with high inorganic&#8208;layer numbers (n) will be more protruding in this portfolio. However, until now, only bilayered (n = 2) CsPbBr3&#8208;based DJ&#8208;type hybrid perovskites are obtained and the higher number of layers (n &gt; 2) remain completely unexplored, owing to the relatively high formation energies. Here, by incorporating diamine into the 3D CsPbBr3  motif, a new Q&#8208;2D trilayered CsPbBr  3  &#8208;based DJ&#8208;type hybrid perovskite that contains organic cation and inorganic Cs metal, namely (4&#8208;AMP)Cs2Pb3Br10  (1, 4&#8208;AMP  2+  = 4&#8208;(aminomethyl)piperidinium, n = 3), is obtained. Excitingly,  1  exhibits excellent photoresponse, superior to its single&#8208;layered and bilayered counterparts. The resulting photodetectors thus exhibit large on/off ratio (&gt; 10  3  ), high photodetectivity (6.5 &#215; 10&#160;  10  Jones) and fast response speed (193 &#956;s). As far as we know,  1  is the first Q&#8208;2D CsPbBr3&#8208;based DJ&#8208;type hybrid perovskites with high n numbers. Our results may widen the range of the potential material in application of photodetection and will be helpful to design hybrid perovskites for other advanced optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Genuine Pores  in a Stable Zinc Phosphite for High H2 Adsorption  and CO2 Capture</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An uncommon example of stable mixed&#8208;ligand zinc phosphite with genuine pores was synthesized by zinc metal, inorganic phosphite acid, thio&#8208;functionalized O&#8208;donor (2,5&#8208;thiophenedicarboxylate, TPDC), and tetradentate N&#8208;donor [1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrakis(imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;ylmethyl)benzene, TIMB] building units assembled into one crystalline structure grown by hydro(solvo)thermal method. This is a very rare case of metal phosphite incorporating both N&#8208; and O&#8208;donor ligands. The tetradentate TIMB linker bond to zinc atoms of the isolated zincophosphite hexamers to form a 3D open&#8208;framework structure by cross&#8208;linking of structural components of 1D chains and 2D layers. Here, the TPDC ligand acts as a monodentate binding modal to functionalize its porous structure with the uncoordinated S atom and COO  &#8722;  group. Remarkably, this compound demonstrates the highest H  2  storage capacity among organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal phosphates (and phosphites) and an excellent CO  2  capture at 298 K compared with the majority of crystalline materials. The possible adsorption sites and selectivity for CO  2  over H  2  , N  2  , and CO at 298 K were calculated using density functional theory (DFT), the ideal adsorption solution theory (IAST), and fitting experimental pure&#8208;component adsorption data.</dc:description>

         <title>Interplay of Anion&#8722;&#960;+ and &#960;+&#8722;&#960;+ Interactions &#8230;.. Applications in Live Cell Mitochondrial Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, the concept of anion&#8208;  &#960;  +  interactions has witnessed unique applications in the field of AIEgen development. In this contribution, we disclose a consolidated study of a library of N&#8208;doped ionic AIEgens accessed through silver&#8208;mediated cyclization of pyridino&#8208;alkynes. A thorough photophysical, computational and crystallographic study has been conducted to rationalize the observed substituent&#8208; and counterion&#8208;dependant fluorescence properties of these luminogens. We further elucidate the prominent role of anion&#8208;  &#960;  +  interactions,  &#960;  +  &#8208;  &#960;  +  interactions and other non&#8208;covalent interactions, in inhibiting the undesired ACQ effect. Finally, we have also demonstrated the application of selected AIEgens for imaging of mitochondria in live cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Pulsed Laser Excited Photoacoustic Effect for Disease Diagnosis and Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pulsed laser can excite light absorber to generate photoacoustic (PA) effect, that is, when the absorber is irradiated with pulsed laser, the absorbed light energy is converted into local heat to cause rapid thermoelastic expansion and generate acoustic wave. The generated PA signal has been widely employed for the diagnosis of many diseases with superb contrast, high penetrability and sensitivity. In addition, with the increase of pulsed laser energy, the resulting PA shockwave and cavitation can promote efficient drug release at lesion sites to potentiate the resulting therapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, the PA shockwave/cavitation can mechanically inhibit disease and produce reactive species. In this Concept article, the principle and research status of pulsed laser excited disease theranostics are briefly summarized, extra suggestions are proposed to inspire extensive PA probes and photodynamic materials as well as novel methodologies.</dc:description>

This synthetic methodology includes selective formation of  gem  &#8208;bis(triflyl)cyclobutenes from biaryl&#8208;alkynes and Tf  2  C=CH  2  followed by desulfinative spirocyclisation mediated by 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol (HFIP).

         <title>The Unexpected Helical Supramolecular Assembly of a Simple Achiral Acetamide Tecton Generates Selective Water Channels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achiral 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;N&#8208;(diphenylmethyl)acetamide (HNDPA) crystallizes in the  P  6  1  chiral space group as a hydrate, building up permeable chiral crystalline helical water channels. The crystallization driven chiral self&#8208;resolution process is highly robust, with the same air stable crystalline form readily obtained from a variety of conditions. Interestingly, the HNDPA supramolecular helix inner pore is filled by a helical water wire. The whole edifice is mainly stabilized by robust hydrogen bonds involving the HNDPA amide bonds and CH  &#8230;  &#960; interactions between the HNDPA phenyl groups. The crystalline structure shows a breathing behavior, with completely reversible release and reuptake of water inside the chiral channel, under ambient conditions. Importantly, the HNDPA channel is able to transport water very efficiently and selectively in biomimetic conditions. With a permeability per channel of 3.3 million water molecules per second in large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) and a total selectivity against NaCl, the HNDPA channel is a very promising functional nanomaterial for future applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Labelling of Peptides with o&#8208;Carboranes via Manganese(I)&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8208;H Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A robust method for the selective labelling of peptides via manganese(I) catalysis was devised to achieve the C&#8208;2 alkenylation of tryptophan containing peptides with 1&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;o&#8208;carboranes. The manganese&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H activation was accomplished with high catalytic efficiency, and featured low toxicity, high functional group tolerance and excellent E&#8208;stereoselectivity. This approach unravels a promising tool for the assembly of o&#8208;carborane with structurally complex peptides of relevance to applications in boron neutron capture therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>C&#8211;X Bond Activation by Palladium:&#160; Steric Shielding versus Steric Attraction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The C&#8211;X bond activation (X = H, C) of a series of substituted C(n&#176;)&#8211;H and C(n&#176;)&#8211;C(m&#176;) bonds with C(n&#176;) and C(m&#176;) = H 3 C&#8211; (methyl, 0&#176;), CH 3 H 2 C&#8211; (primary, 1&#176;), (CH 3 ) 2 HC&#8211; (secondary, 2&#176;), (CH 3 ) 3 C&#8211; (tertiary, 3&#176;) by palladium were investigated using relativistic dispersion&#8208;corrected density functional theory at ZORA&#8208;BLYP&#8208;D3(BJ)/TZ2P. We pinpoint the effect of the stepwise introduction of substituents at the C&#8211;X bond on the bond activation process. The C(n&#176;)&#8211;X bonds become substantially weaker going from C(0&#176;)&#8211;X, to C(1&#176;)&#8211;X, to C(2&#176;)&#8211;X, to C(3&#176;)&#8211;X because of the increasing steric repulsion between the C(n&#176;)&#8208; and X&#8208;group. Interestingly, this often does not lead to a lower barrier for the C(n&#176;)&#8211;X bond activation. The C&#8211;H activation barrier, for example, decreases from C(0&#176;)&#8211;X, to C(1&#176;)&#8211;X, to C(2&#176;)&#8211;X and then increases again for the very crowded C(3&#176;)&#8211;X bond. For the more congested C&#8211;C bond, in contrast, the activation barrier always increases as the degree of substitution is increased. Our activation strain and matching energy decomposition analyses reveal that these differences in C&#8211;H and C&#8211;C bond activation can be traced back to the opposing interplay between steric repulsion across the C&#8211;X bond versus that between the catalyst and substrate.</dc:description>

         <title>Inactivation of competitive decay channels leads to enhanced coumarin photochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the development of photolabile protecting groups, it is of high interest to selectively modify photochemical properties with structural changes as simple as possible. In this work, we want to adopt the knowledge of fluorophore optimization and use it to design new coumarin&#8208; based photocages. We selectively modulated the photolysis efficiency by inactivating competitive decay channels, such as twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) or hydogen&#8208;bonding and demonstrated the photolytic release of the neurotransmitter serotonin. Structural modifications inspired by the fluorophore ATTO 390 led to a significant increase in the uncaging cross section that can be further improved by the simple addition of a double bond. Using ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, we gained insights into the underlying solvent&#8208;dependent photophysical dynamics. The chromophores presented here are excellently suited as new photocages in the visible wavelength range due to their simple synthesis and their superior photochemical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Green&#8208;Light Activatable BODIPY and Coumarin 5&#8217;&#8208;Caps for Oligonucleotide Photocaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We synthesized two green&#8208;light activatable 5&#8217;&#8208;caps for oligonucleotides based on the BODIPY and coumarin scaffold. Both bear an alkyne functionality allowing their use in numerous biological applications. They were successfully incorporated in oligonucleotides via solid&#8208;phase synthesis. Copper&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) using a bisazide photo&#8208;tether gave cyclic oligonucleotides that could be relinearized by activation with green light and were shown to exhibit high stability against exonucleases. Chemical ligation as another example for bioconjugation yielded oligonucleotides with an internal strand break site. Irradiation at 530 nm or 565 nm resulted in complete photolysis of both caging groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Broad&#8208;spectrum antidote discovery by untangling the reactivation mechanism of nerve agent inhibited acetylcholinesterase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactivators are vital for the treatment of organophosphorus nerve agent (OPNA) intoxication but new alternatives are needed due to their limited clinical applicability. The toxicity of OPNAs stems from covalent inhibition of the essential enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE), which reactivators relieve via a chemical reaction with the inactivated enzyme. Here, we present new strategies and tools for developing reactivators. We discover suitable inhibitor scaffolds by using an activity&#8208;independent competition assay to study non&#8208;covalent interactions with OPNA&#8208;AChEs and transform these inhibitors into broad&#8208;spectrum reactivators. Moreover, we identify determinants of reactivation efficiency by analysing reactivation and pre&#8208;reactivation kinetics together with structural data. Our results show that new OPNA reactivators can be discovered rationally by exploiting detailed knowledge of the reactivation mechanism of OPNA&#8208;inhibited AChE.</dc:description>

         <title>Anticancer Aminoferrocene Derivatives Inducing Production of Mitochondrial Reactive Oxygen Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual aminoferrocene (AF) agent (3&#8201;d) is reported, which does not react with reactive oxygen species (ROS) in contrast to usual AF agents (e.&#8201;g., 3&#8201;b) and exhibits excellent anticancer effects in a variety of cancer cells and in a murine cancer Nemeth&#8208;Kellner lymphoma (NK/Ly) model. The mode of action relies on the increase of the level of mitochondrial ROS (mROS), whereas usual AF agents (e.&#8201;g. 3&#8201;b) do not affect mROS.







Abstract
Elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and deficient mitochondria are two weak points of cancer cells. Their simultaneous targeting is a valid therapeutic strategy to design highly potent anticancer drugs. The remaining challenge is to limit the drug effects to cancer cells without affecting normal ones. We have previously developed three aminoferrocene (AF)&#8208;based derivatives, which are activated in the presence of elevated levels of ROS present in cancer cells with formation of electron&#8208;rich compounds able to generate ROS and reduce mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). All of them exhibit important drawbacks including either low efficacy or high unspecific toxicity that prevents their application in&#8197;vivo up to date. Herein we describe unusual AF&#8208;derivatives lacking these drawbacks. These compounds act via an alternative mechanism: they are chemically stable in the presence of ROS, generate mitochondrial ROS in cancer cells, but not normal cells and exhibit anticancer effect in&#8197;vivo.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Reductive Coupling of para&#8208;Quinone Methides with 4&#8208;Cyanopyridines Enabled by Pyridine&#8208;Boryl Radicals: Access to Pyridylated Diarylmethanes with Anti&#8208;Cancer Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly diverse pyridylated diarylmethanes are rapidly synthesized in metal&#8208;free process mediated by B2pin2/4&#8208;cyanopyridine system. In this reaction, the pyridine&#8208;boryl radical addition to C=O bond of p&#8208;QMs 1 promotes the generation of diarylmethane radicals, which are then coupled with pyridine&#8208;boryl radicals to obtain the desired products 3. The utility of the method was highlighted by biological activity identification.







Abstract
Reported herein is a streamlined protocol to produce pyridylated diarylmethanes through pyridine&#8208;boryl radical induced reductive coupling between para&#8208;quinone methides (p&#8208;QMs) and 4&#8208;cyanopyridines using bis(pinacolato)diboron (B2pin2) as a templated reagent. The metal&#8208;free process is characterized by an operationally simple approach, excellent chemoselectivity (1,2&#8208; vs. 1,6&#8208;selectivity), and a broad substrate scope with good functional group compatibility. The mechanistic studies provided important insights into the reductive cross&#8208;coupling process between diarylmethyl radical and pyridine&#8208;boryl radical. Moreover, part of the obtained pyridylated diarylmethane products were screened against a panel of cancer cell lines, and 3&#8201;v was confirmed to significantly inhibit the proliferation of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells. This method offers a platform for the preparation of new lead compounds with antitumor activity.

&lt;p&gt;Reported herein is a streamlined protocol to produce pyridylated diarylmethanes through pyridine-boryl radical induced reductive coupling between &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-quinone methides (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-QMs) and 4-cyanopyridines using bis(pinacolato)diboron (B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;pin&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as a templated reagent. The metal-free process is characterized by an operationally simple approach, excellent chemoselectivity (1,2- vs. 1,6-selectivity), and a broad substrate scope with good functional group compatibility. The mechanistic studies provided important insights into the reductive cross-coupling process between diarylmethyl radical and pyridine-boryl radical. Moreover, part of the obtained pyridylated diarylmethane products were screened against a panel of cancer cell lines, and &lt;b&gt;3&#8201;v&lt;/b&gt; was confirmed to significantly inhibit the proliferation of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells. This method offers a platform for the preparation of new lead compounds with antitumor activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stable Triarylmethyl Radicals and Cobalt(II) Ions Based 1D/2D Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imidazole&#8208;substituted tris(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl radical ligands (L1 and L2) were synthesized in a facile way. They are stable and can be used to construct crystalline 1D and 2D open&#8208;shell coordination polymers (CoCP&#8208;1 and CoCP&#8208;2) with cobalt(II) ions. Both polymers show antiferromagnetic interaction between carbon&#8208;centered radicals and the high&#8208;spin Co(II) ions.







Abstract
The incorporation of organic radicals into coordination polymers was considered as a promising strategy to promote metal&#8208;ligand exchange interactions, but there are only a very limited number of stable organic radical&#8208;based ligands that can serve well such a purpose. Herein, we report two new tris(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM) radical&#8208;based ligands L1 and L2 with two and three imidazole substituents, respectively. The imidazole unit serves as a coordination site and it can also stabilize the TTM radical by intramolecular donor&#8211;acceptor interaction. Coordination of L1 and L2 with cobalt(II) ions gave the corresponding one&#8208; (CoCP&#8208;1) and two&#8208;dimensional (CoCP&#8208;2) coordination polymers, the structures of which were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Magnetic measurements and theoretical calculations suggest antiferromagnetic coupling between the paramagnetic cobalt(II) ions and the radical ligands. Our study provides a rational design for stable organic radical&#8208;based ligands and further demonstrated the feasibility of a metal&#8211;radical approach toward magnetic materials.

         <title>Orthogonalization of Polyaryl Linkers as a Route to More Porous Phosphonate Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Orthogonalization of components inhibits efficient packing, whether of bagels or polyaryl linkers in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). This strategy was applied to polyphosphonate linkers to generate six new MOF structures (CALF&#8208;35 to &#8208;39). Ba, Sr, Mg, Zn and two Ca structures were obtained from a new trigonal linker with orthogonal peripheral aryl rings to inhibit efficient packing. The structures are discussed considering their porosity, stability and selective sorption of gases.







Abstract
The coordinative pliancy of the phosphonate functional group means that metal&#8208;phosphonate materials often self&#8208;assemble as well&#8208;packed structures with minimal porosity, as efficient inter&#8208;ligand packing is enabled. Here, we report a multistep synthesis of a novel aryl&#8208;phosphonate linker with an orthogonalized ligand core, 1,3,5&#8208;tris(4&#8217;&#8208;phosphonophenyl)&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzene (H6L2) designed to form more open structures. A series of crystalline metal&#8208;phosphonate frameworks (CALF&#8208;35 to &#8208;39) have been assembled by coordinating to divalent metals (Ba, Sr, Ca, Mg, Zn). H6L2 is unable to pack efficiently and, as a consequence, yields several distinct microporous structures. The resulting structures are discussed in detail, with a focus on the solid&#8208;state packing of the sterically rigidified linker. Combined with larger cations (Sr, and Ba), H6L2 packs in a parallel&#8208;offset manner, yielding isomorphous and microporous metal&#8208;organic frameworks (CALF&#8208;35 (Sr), and (Ba)). When coordinated to smaller metals (Ca, Mg, Zn), H6L2 forms four new structures. Two Ca MOFs of different stoichiometry, (CALF&#8208;36 and 37) and a Mg MOF CALF&#8208;38 show narrow pores and have high selectivities for CO2 over N2 and CH4. Finally, in CALF&#8208;39 (Zn), H6L2 linkers pack in a herringbone fashion, resulting in a material with 10.9&#215;10.1&#8197;&#197;2 square channels. The stability of all structures was tested, and the most porous structure, CALF&#8208;39 (Zn), was found to retain its structure and gas adsorption after immersion in water over pH&#8197;3&#8211;11.

         <title>Conversion of CH4 Catalyzed by Gas Phase Ions Containing Metals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review article discusses the significant progress that has been made for catalytic methane conversion in the gas phase, with focus on the coupling reactions of CH4 molecules and of CH4 with other substrates (O2, O3, N2O, CO2, and H2O) catalyzed by ions containing metals. The mechanistic details for generation of C&#8722;C coupling and C&#8208;O coupling products from methane have been provided at a strictly molecular level.







Abstract
Methane is an abundant and cheap feedstock to produce valuable chemicals. The catalytic reaction of methane conversion generally requires the participation of multiple molecules (such as two or three CH4 molecules, O2, CO2, etc.). Such complex process includes the cleavage of original chemical bonds, formation of new chemical bonds, and desorption of products. The gas phase study provides a unique arena to gain molecular&#8208;level insights into the detailed mechanisms of bond&#8208;breaking and bond&#8208;forming involved in complicated catalytic reactions. In this Review, we introduce the methane conversion catalyzed by gas phase ions containing metals and three topics will be discussed: (1) the direct coupling of methane molecules, (2) the conversion of CH4 with O2, O3 and N2O, and (3) the conversion of CH4 with CO2 and H2O. The obtained mechanistic aspects may provide new clues for rational design of better&#8208;performing catalysts for conversion of methane to value&#8208;added products.

         <title>Site Occupancies, Electron&#8211;Vibration Interaction and Energy Transfer of CaMgSi2O6: Eu2+, Mn2+ Phosphors for Potential Temperature&#8208;Sensing and Anti&#8208;counterfeiting Applications</title>

The two&#8208;site occupancies, the electron&#8211;vibration interaction analyses of Mn2+, and the Eu2+&#8722;Mn2+ energy transfer are discussed. The different thermal quenching behaviours and emission colours of Eu2+ and Mn2+ ions in CaMgSi2O6 endow the co&#8208;doped samples with potential applications in temperature&#8208;sensing and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.







Abstract
Eu2+&#8208;, Mn2+&#8208; and Eu2+&#8722;Mn2+&#8208;doped CaMgSi2O6 phosphors have been prepared by a high&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state reaction. Systematic investigation of the concentration&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent luminescence of Mn2+ showed that Mn2+ ions occupy two distinct sites in CaMgSi2O6. Electron&#8211;vibration interaction (EVI) analyses of Mn2+ ions revealed Huang&#8211;Rhys factors of 4.73 and 2.82 as well as effective phonon energies of 313 and 383&#8197;cm&#8722;1 for the two sites. Eu2+&#8722;Mn2+ energy transfer is also discussed, and its efficiency is estimated by lifetime and luminescence spectra. The different thermal quenching behaviours of Eu2+ and Mn2+, the distinct emission colours of Eu2+ (blue, band peak at &#8764;451&#8197;nm) and Mn2+ (yellow&#8211;red range, band peaks at &#8764;583 and 693&#8197;nm) endow the co&#8208;doped samples with potential applications in luminescence thermometry and temperature&#8208;/excitation wavelength&#8208;responsive dual anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

&lt;p&gt;Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-, Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;- and Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-doped CaMgSi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; phosphors have been prepared by a high-temperature solid-state reaction. Systematic investigation of the concentration- and temperature-dependent luminescence of Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; showed that Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions occupy two distinct sites in CaMgSi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. Electron&#8211;vibration interaction (EVI) analyses of Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions revealed Huang&#8211;Rhys factors of 4.73 and 2.82 as well as effective phonon energies of 313 and 383&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for the two sites. Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; energy transfer is also discussed, and its efficiency is estimated by lifetime and luminescence spectra. The different thermal quenching behaviours of Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, the distinct emission colours of Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (blue, band peak at &#8764;451&#8197;nm) and Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (yellow&#8211;red range, band peaks at &#8764;583 and 693&#8197;nm) endow the co-doped samples with potential applications in luminescence thermometry and temperature-/excitation wavelength-responsive dual anti-counterfeiting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Generalizing the Aromatic &#948;&#8208;Amino Acid Foldamer Helix</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quinoline (Q), pyridine (P), and benzene&#8208;based (B) &#948;&#8208;amino acids are shown to be compatible in that sequences comprised of these units generally fold into canonical aromatic helical conformations in water. Exceptions include (P)n and (B)n sequences, but not (PB)n. Helix handedness inversion rates are considerably reduced upon introducing a small proportion of Q monomers. The position of side chains can be modulated upon changing the Q/B ratio.







Abstract
A series of aromatic oligoamide foldamer sequences containing different proportions of three &#948;&#8208;amino acids derived from quinoline, pyridine, and benzene and possessing varying flexibility, for example due to methylene bridges, were synthesized. Crystallographic structures of two key sequences and 1H NMR data in water concur to show that a canonical aromatic helix fold prevails in almost all cases and that helix stability critically depends on the ratio between rigid and flexible units. Notwithstanding subtle variations of curvature, i.&#8201;e. the numbers of units per turn, the aromatic &#948;&#8208;peptide helix is therefore shown to be general and tolerant of a great number of sp3 centers. We also demonstrate canonical helical folding upon alternating two monomers that do not promote folding when taken separately: folding occurs with two methylenes between every other unit, not with one methylene between every unit. These findings highlight that a fine&#8208;tuning of helix handedness inversion kinetics, curvature, and side chain positioning in aromatic &#948;&#8208;peptidic foldamers can be realized by systematically combining different yet compatible &#948;&#8208;amino acids.

         <title>The Role of Radical Bridges in Polynuclear Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In N
&#8208;radical&#8208;bridged diterbium complexes, the radical bridge induces crystal&#8208;field and magnetic anisotropy that interferes destructively with that of the outer ligands. The performance of polynuclear exchange&#8208;coupled SMMs may be significantly enhanced if the crystal&#8208;field and magnetic anisotropy induced by the local ligands and the bridging ligands are engineered collinear to each other.







Abstract
Employing radical bridges between anisotropic metal ions has been a viable route to achieve high&#8208;performance single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs). While the bridges have been mainly considered for their ability to promote exchange interactions, the crystal&#8208;field effect arising from them has not been taken into account explicitly. This lack of consideration may distort the understanding and limit the development of the entire family. To shed light on this aspect, herein we report a theoretical investigation of a series of N
&#8208;radical&#8208;bridged diterbium complexes. It is found that while promoting strong exchange coupling between the terbium ions, the N
&#8208;radical induces a crystal field that interferes destructively with that of the outer ligands, and thus reduces the overall SMM behavior. Based on the theoretical results, we conclude that the SMM behavior in this series could be further maximized if the crystal field of the outer ligands is designed to be collinear with that of the radical bridge. This conclusion can be generalized to all exchange&#8208;coupled SMMs.

         <title>Mesoionic Dithiolates (MIDts) Derived from 1,3&#8208;Imidazole&#8208;Based Anionic Dicarbenes (ADCs)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mesoionic dithiolates Li(MIDts) as well as heteroleptic (MIDt)GeCl and homoleptic (MIDt)2Ge germylenes are reported as crystalline solids. The germylene (MIDt)2Ge features the highest&#8208;lying HOMO (&#8722;4.37&#8197;eV) and has the smallest HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gap (2.82&#8197;eV) among the hitherto known germylenes. Insertion of GeCl2 into the Ge&#8722;Cl bond of (MIDt)GeCl affords the Ge&#8722;Ge catenation product (MIDt)GeGeCl3, a mixed&#8208;valence Ge(+1)/Ge(+3) compound.







Abstract
Mesoionic dithiolates [(MIDtAr)Li(LiBr)2(THF)3] (MIDtAr={SC(NDipp)}2CAr; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3; Ar=Ph 3&#8201;a, 3&#8208;MeC6H4 (3&#8208;Tol) 3&#8201;b, 4&#8208;Me2NC6H4 (DMP) 3&#8201;c) and [(MIDtPh)Li(THF)2] (4) are readily accessible (in&#8805;90&#8201;% yields) as crystalline solids on treatments of anionic dicarbenes Li(ADCAr) (2&#8201;a&#8208;c) (ADCAr={C(NDipp)2}2CAr) with elemental sulfur. 3&#8201;a&#8208;c and 4 are monoanionic ditopic ligands with both the sulfur atoms formally negatively charged, while the 1,3&#8208;imidazole unit bears a formal positive charge. Treatment of 4 with (L)GeCl2 (L=1,4&#8208;dioxane) affords the germylene (MIDtPh)GeCl (5) featuring a three&#8208;coordinated Ge atom. 5 reacts with (L)GeCl2 to give the Ge&#8722;Ge catenation product (MIDtPh)GeGeCl3 (6). KC8 reduction of 5 yields the homoleptic germylene (MIDtPh)2Ge (7). Compounds 3&#8201;a&#8208;c and 4&#8211;7 have been characterized by spectroscopic studies and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The electronic structures of 4&#8211;7 have been analyzed by DFT calculations.

         <title>Glucosylated 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylpyrimidines as Epigenetic DNA Bases Regulating Transcription and Restriction Cleavage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glucosylation's glitches: Glucosylated 5&#8208;hydroxymethylpyrimidines were studied as epigenetic DNA modifications that fully inhibit the cleavage of DNA by restriction endonucleases. However, only the presence of glucosylated 5hmU inhibited transcription, whereas DNA containing glucosylated 5hmC remained transcriptionally active. This suggests a role for glucosylation by T4 phage &#946;&#8208;glucosyltransferase.







Abstract
5&#8208;(&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;Glucopyranosyloxymethyl)&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyuridine and &#8208;cytidine 5&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;triphosphates were prepared and used for polymerase&#8208;mediated (primer extension or PCR) synthesis of DNA containing glucosylated 5&#8208;hydroxymethyluracil (5hmU) or 5&#8208;hydroxymethyluracil (5hmC). The presence of any glucosylated pyrimidines fully protected DNA from cleavage by type II restriction endonucleases. On the other hand, while the presence of glucosylated 5hmU completely inhibited transcription by bacterial (Escherichia coli) RNA polymerase, the DNA containing the corresponding glucosylated 5hmC allowed a similar level of transcription as natural DNA. This suggests different roles of these hypermodified bases in the epigenetic regulation of transcription in bacteriophages or kinetoplastid parasites. Consequently, enzymatic glucosylation of 5hmC&#8208;containing DNA can be used for tuning of transcription activity.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Glucosylation's glitches&lt;/b&gt;: Glucosylated 5-hydroxymethylpyrimidines were studied as epigenetic DNA modifications that fully inhibit the cleavage of DNA by restriction endonucleases. However, only the presence of glucosylated 5hmU inhibited transcription, whereas DNA containing glucosylated 5hmC remained transcriptionally active. This suggests a role for glucosylation by T4 phage &#946;-glucosyltransferase.

The presence of any glucosylated pyrimidines fully protected DNA from cleavage by type II restriction endonucleases.

         <title>Functional Groups Assisted Tunable Dielectric Permittivity of Guest&#8208;Free Zn&#8208;Based Coordination Polymers for Gate Dielectrics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dielectric tuning of two Zn&#8208;based coordination polymers via the tuning of the electron&#8208;donating (R=NH2) and electron&#8208;withdrawing (R=NO2) groups is reported. The tunable high dielectric properties, wide bandgaps and thermal stability of these CPs clearly demonstrate their potential for use in the design of future gate dielectric materials.







Abstract
The dielectric properties of coordination polymers has been a topic of recent interest, but the role of different functional groups on the dielectric properties of these polymers has not yet been fully addressed. Herein, the effects of electron&#8208;donating (R=NH2) and electron&#8208;withdrawing (R=NO2) groups on the dielectric behavior of such materials were investigated for two thermally stable and guest&#8208;free Zn&#8208;based coordination polymers, [Zn(L1)(L2)]n (1) and [Zn(L1)(L3)]n (2) [L1=2&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl) benzimidazole (Pbim), L2=5&#8208;aminoisophthalate (Aip), and L3=5&#8208;nitroisophthalate (Nip)]. The results of dielectric studies of 1 revealed that it possesses a high dielectric constant (&#954;=65.5 at 1&#8197;kHz), while compound 2 displayed an even higher dielectric constant (&#954;=110.3 at 1&#8197;kHz). The electron donating and withdrawing effects of the NH2 and NO2 substituents induce changes in the polarity of the polymers, which is due to the inductive effect from the aryl ring for both NO2 and NH2. Theoretical results from density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which also support the experimental findings, show that both compounds have a distinct electronic behavior with diverse wide bandgaps. The significance of the current work is to provide information about the structure&#8208;dielectric property relationships. So, this study promises to pave the way for further research on the effects of different functional groups on coordination polymers on their dielectric properties.

         <dc:description>We report a facile strategy to prepare a large amount of ultrathin graphdiyne (GDY) with good crystallinity in the mixture of oil&#8208;water systems. By simply mixing the solution of GDY monomer in CHCl  3  and the copper acetate solution as a catalyst in water and stirring at room temperature, ultrathin GDY films with a thickness of ~4 nm were obtained in a yield of 95%. This work provides a feasible path for the substantial preparation of GDY films and may pave the way to the development of substantial preparation of the GDY materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solar&#8208;driven overall water splitting is a promising strategy to store solar energy in the form of green hydrogen, but its hydrogen generation efficiency is still low despite years of research. Graphene has attracted great attention in solar&#8208;driven overall water splitting because it has quite versatile properties and is able to act as photo harvester, electron mediator and cocatalyst in a photocatalysis system. Herein, a review of graphene&#8208;based nanomaterials for solar&#8208;driven overall water splitting is presented. The review starts from two commonly&#8208;used methods, photocatalysis and photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, and the fundamentals of these two methods. The approaches for the preparation of photocatalysts and photoelectrodes containing graphene are presented and the roles of graphene are discussed. Accordingly, the challenges and prospects of the future applications of graphene in solar&#8208;driven water splitting are highlighted.</dc:description>

         <title>Taming of Singlet Oxygen: Towards Artificial Oxygen Carriers based on 1,4&#8208;Dialkylnaphthalenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Naphthalene endoperoxides are known as convenient sources of singlet oxygen (O 2 , 1 &#916; g ) which is the major product of endoperoxide cycloreversion reaction. However, their potential as carriers of ground state molecular oxygen (O 2 , 3 &#931; g ) similar to artificial oxygen carriers remain largely unexplored. This is due to the extreme reactivity and cytotoxic effects of the released singlet oxygen. We now report that a compound with a bimodular design, which incorporates an endoperoxide and an efficient physical quencher of singlet oxygen, DABCO, produces exclusively ground state molecular oxygen. This result, coupled with the fact that oxygen release rates from endoperoxides are highly amenable to fine tuning in a very broad range, and open to targeting by ligand attachment, raises the potential of these compounds far above any comparable chemical, or even biochemical sources. In cell culture experiments, we showed that the addition of the endoperoxide&#8208;quencher conjugate can enhance and sustain cell proliferation.</dc:description>

         <title>A new look at molecular and electronic structure of homoleptic diiron(II,II) complexes with N,N&#8208;bidentate ligands: Combined experimental and theoretical study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Paddlewheel&#8208;type dinuclear complexes featuring metal&#8211;metal bonding have been the subject of widespread interest due to fundamental concern in their electronic structures and potential applications. Here, we explore the molecular and electronic structures of diiron(II,II) complexes with N,N&#8217;&#8208;diarylformamidinate ligands. While a paddlewheel&#8208;type diiron(II,II) complex with N,N&#8217;&#8208;diphenylformamidinate ligands (DPhF) exhibits the centrosymmetric [Fe2(&#956;&#8208;DPhF)4] structure, a minor alteration in the ligand system, i.e. switching from phenyl to p&#8208;tolyl N&#8208;substituted formamidinate ligand (DTolF), resulted in the isolation of an unprecedented non&#8208;centrosymmetric [Fe(&#956;&#8208;DTolF)3Fe(&#954;2&#8208;DTolF)] complex. Both complexes were characterized using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, magnetic measurements, 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry along with high&#8208;level ab&#8208;initio calculations. The results provide a new view on a range of factors controlling the ground&#8208;state electronic configuration and structural diversity of homoleptic diiron(II,II) complexes. Interestingly, the Mayer bond orders for the Fe&#8208;Fe interactions are significantly lower than 1 and equal to 0.15 and 0.28 for [Fe2(&#956;&#8208;DPhF)4] and [Fe(&#956;&#8208;DTolF)3Fe(&#954;2&#8208;DTolF)], respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Diverse supports for immobilization of catalysts in continuous flow reactors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rapid development of continuous flow processes is driving innovations in various chemical syntheses and industrial productions. Immobilizing catalysts in flow reactors allows transformations with high&#8208;efficiency and excludes the subsequent separation procedures. This concept outlines the approaches to incorporate catalysts within flow reactors, with particular focus on the application of additional supports including inorganic materials like silica, zeolite and reduced graphene oxide, polymeric materials like polymer packings, monoliths, cross&#8208;linked gels and polymer brushes, and other materials for specific conditions like transparent glass fibers and glass beads. Furthermore, advanced methods to develop ordered micro&#8208;/nanoarrays from internal walls of flow channels for immobilization of catalysts as well as application of innovative vortex fluidic devices are discussed to inspire new designs of supports for novel fluidic reactors with broad applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A Carbene&#8208;Stabilized Boryl&#8208;Phosphinidene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
What hides within: Three different singlet boryl phosphinidenes were synthesized by using cAAC carbene, and their inversely polarized phosphaalkene characteristics were investigated. Quantum mechanical studies suggest that the P center of these boryl phosphinidenes contains two lone pairs viz., an &#963;&#8208;type lone pair and a &#8220;hidden&#8221; &#960;&#8208;type lone pair.







Abstract
Herein, the synthesis and characterization of the carbene&#8208;stabilized boryl phosphinidenes 1&#8211;3 are reported. Compounds 1&#8211;3 are obtained by reacting Me&#8208;cAAC=PK (Me2&#8208;cAAC=dimethyl cyclic(alkyl)(amino)carbene) and dihaloaryl borane in toluene. All three compounds were characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Quantum mechanical studies indicated that these compounds have two lone pairs on the P center viz., an &#963;&#8208;type lone pair and a &#8220;hidden&#8221; &#960;&#8208;type lone pair. Hence, these compounds can act as double Lewis bases, and the basicity of the &#960;&#8208;type lone pair is higher than the &#963;&#8208;type lone pair.

         <title>New Materials formed by combining Inorganic Glasses and Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Combining glassy or crystalline metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with inorganic glasses to create novel hybrid composites and blends is proposed. The motivation behind this new composite approach is to improve the processability issues and mechanical performance of MOFs, whilst maintaining their ubiquitous properties. Herein, the precepts of successful composite formation and pairing of MOF and glass MOFs with inorganic glasses are presented. Focus is also given to the synthetic routes to such materials and the challenges anticipated in both their production and characterisation. Depending on their chemical nature, materials are classified as crystalline MOF&#8208;glass composites and blends. Additionally, the potential properties and applications of these two classes of materials are considered, the key aim being the retention of beneficial properties of both components, whilst circumventing their respective drawbacks.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Control of Microbial Movement by Photoswitchable ATP Antagonists</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized compounds acting as antagonists of ATP and whose activity is reversibly changed by light. When the compound was given to a microorganism moving by flagella, the movement could be changed significantly and reversibly by alternating irradiation of two wavelengths. This means that we can freely control the ATP world that governs the energy flow of living things.







Abstract
Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the energy source for various biochemical processes and biomolecular motors in living things. Development of ATP antagonists and their stimuli&#8208;controlled actions offer a novel approach to regulate biological processes. Herein, we developed azobenzene&#8208;based photoswitchable ATP antagonists for controlling the activity of motor proteins; cytoplasmic and axonemal dyneins. The new ATP antagonists showed reversible photoswitching of cytoplasmic dynein activity in an in&#8197;vitro dynein&#8208;microtubule system due to the trans and cis photoisomerization of their azobenzene segment. Importantly, our ATP antagonists reversibly regulated the axonemal dynein motor activity for the force generation in a demembranated model of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We found that the trans and cis isomers of ATP antagonists significantly differ in their affinity to the ATP binding site.

         <title>From Light to Structure: Photo Initiators for Radical Two&#8208;Photon Polymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;photon polymerization has established itself as one of the most important techniques for the fabrication of 3D structures in the micro to nanometer range. To ensure precise and rapid fabrication, photo initiators (PI) are used that have been specially developed for this purpose. In this review article, the PIs known to the literature are listed and compared in particular according to their structural elements, fabrication behavior and two&#8208;photon cross&#8208;section.







Abstract
Two&#8208;photon polymerization (2PP) represents a powerful technique for the fabrication of precise three&#8208;dimensional structures on a micro&#8208; and nanometer scale for various applications. While many review articles are focusing on the used polymeric materials and their application in 2PP, in this review the class of two&#8208;photon photo initiators (2PI) used for radical polymerization is discussed in detail. Because the demand for highly efficient 2PI has increased in the last decades, different approaches in designing new efficient 2PIs occurred. This review summarizes the 2PIs known in literature and discusses their absorption behavior under one&#8208; and two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) conditions, their two&#8208;photon cross sections (&#963;TPA) as well as their efficiency under 2PP conditions. Here, the photo initiators are grouped depending on their chromophore system (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D, D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D, etc.). Their polymerization efficiencies are evaluated by fabrication windows (FW) depending on different laser intensities and writing speeds.

&lt;p&gt;Two-photon polymerization (2PP) represents a powerful technique for the fabrication of precise three-dimensional structures on a micro- and nanometer scale for various applications. While many review articles are focusing on the used polymeric materials and their application in 2PP, in this review the class of two-photon photo initiators (2PI) used for radical polymerization is discussed in detail. Because the demand for highly efficient 2PI has increased in the last decades, different approaches in designing new efficient 2PIs occurred. This review summarizes the 2PIs known in literature and discusses their absorption behavior under one- and two-photon absorption (2PA) conditions, their two-photon cross sections (&#963;&lt;sub&gt;TPA&lt;/sub&gt;) as well as their efficiency under 2PP conditions. Here, the photo initiators are grouped depending on their chromophore system (D-&#960;-A-&#960;-D, D-&#960;-D, etc.). Their polymerization efficiencies are evaluated by fabrication windows (FW) depending on different laser intensities and writing speeds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Macrocyclic Donor&#8208;Acceptor Dyads Composed of Oligothiophene Half&#8208;Cycles and Perylene Bisimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and properties of perylene bisimide dyes bridged by &#945;&#8208;oligothiophenes bearing four, five, six and seven thiophene units is described. Next to panchromatic light absorption in the UV/Vis spectrum, the compounds show donor bridge size&#8208;dependent electronic properties and excited state dynamics.







Abstract
A series of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) macrocyclic dyads consisting of an electron&#8208;poor perylene bisimide (PBI) &#960;&#8208;scaffold bridged with electron&#8208;rich &#945;&#8208;oligothiophenes bearing four, five, six and seven thiophene units between the two phenyl&#8208;imide substituents has been synthesized and characterized by steady&#8208;state UV/Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, cyclic and differential pulse voltammetry as well as transient absorption spectroscopy. Tying the oligothiophene strands in a conformationally fixed macrocyclic arrangement leads to a more rigid &#960;&#8208;scaffold with vibronic fine structure in the respective absorption spectra. Electrochemical analysis disclosed charged state properties in solution which are strongly dependent on the degree of rigidification within the individual macrocycle. Investigation of the excited state dynamics revealed an oligothiophene bridge size&#8208;dependent fast charge transfer process for the macrocyclic dyads upon PBI subunit excitation.

         <title>Chalcogen Bonding with Diaryl Ditellurides: Evidence from Solid&#8208;State and Solution Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the solid state, due to Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te interactions, diaryl ditellurides are facing to each other, like these &#8220;solid/frozen&#8221; Scottish cows in winter. Once the molecules are &#8220;defrosted&#8221; in solution, new interactions occur with soluble Lewis bases, including some solvents. More information can be found in the Research Article by Patrick Pale, V. Mamane and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200395).

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Thermal Synthesis of Extra&#8208;Large&#8208;Pore Aluminophosphate Zeotype via Self&#8208;Assembly of Double&#8208;Four&#8208;Ring Unit</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple solvent&#8208;free thermal synthesis method was developed to prepare extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore aluminophosphate zeotype DNL&#8208;1, unravelling its crystallization process via self&#8208;assembly of d4r unit, an intermediate formed at synthesis conditions of low water content in presence of a template structure with alkyl chains of proper length. This new synthesis strategy is suitable for rational preparation of d4r&#8208;containing extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore zeolitic materials in the absence of Ge.







Abstract
The use of Ge as framework atom to direct the formation of double&#8208;four&#8208;ring (d4r) unit is an effective way to prepare zeolite with extra&#8208;large pores, which however also brings about serious problems with regard to production cost and structure stability for their practical application. A new solvent&#8208;free thermal synthesis strategy is presented here for facile preparation and molecular&#8208;level mechanism study of extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore aluminophosphate zeotype DNL&#8208;1 with &#8208;CLO structure. For the first time, the formation of intermediate d4r in the induction period was successfully confirmed, and was correlated with the synthesis condition of low water content and quaternary ammonium template with suitable alkyl chain length. The self&#8208;assembly pathway via d4r to form lta, afterwards clo and super cages was further revealed. This work shed light on the rational synthesis of Ge&#8208;free extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore zeotypes based on d4r route.

         <title>On the Mediated Electron Transfer of Immobilized Galactose Oxidase for Biotechnological Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrical wiring of galactose oxidase with a redox polymer is proven to support bio&#8208;electrocatalytic conversions with minimal interference from O2, thereby enabling the oxidation of primary alcohols while decreasing the associated production of harmful H2O2. A practical example is shown for the conversion of bio&#8208;renewable substrates. Product evaluation is used to investigate whether or not carboxylic acid derivatives are obtained after accumulation of the aldehyde product in the reaction medium.







Abstract
The use of enzymes as catalysts in chemical synthesis offers advantages in terms of clean and highly selective transformations. Galactose oxidase (GalOx) is a remarkable enzyme with several applications in industrial conversions as it catalyzes the oxidation of primary alcohols. We have investigated the wiring of GalOx with a redox polymer; this enables mediated electron transfer with the electrode surface for its potential application in biotechnological conversions. As a result of electrochemical regeneration of the catalytic center, the formation of harmful H2O2 is minimized during enzymatic catalysis. The introduced bioelectrode was applied to the conversion of bio&#8208;renewable platform materials, with glycerol as model substrate. The biocatalytic transformations of glycerol and 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) were investigated in a circular flow&#8208;through setup to assess the possibility of substrate over&#8208;oxidation, which is observed for glycerol oxidation but not during HMF conversion.
