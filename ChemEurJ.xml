         <title>Coupling CoOx@NC with NiFe LDH Enhances Oxygen Electrocatalysis for Rechargeable High&#8208;Efficiency Zn&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing bifunctional catalysts with the high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalytic activities is of great significance in improving the efficiency of rechargeable Zn&#8208;air batteries. Herein, this study adopts simple one&#8208;pot pyrolysis and subsequent hydrothermal strategies to prepare a high&#8208;performance bifunctional composite catalyst by coupling a layered hydroxide NiFe LDH with Co and N codoped carbon framework, composed of cobalt oxide and metallic Co nanoparticles distributed on interconnected porous carbon nanosheets and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Benefiting from the exposure of more active sites, high conductivity, and beneficial charge transport advantages, the best catalyst (CoOx@NC)2&#8208;NiFe demonstrates excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic activities and stability for oxygen&#8208;related electrochemical reactions, exhibiting a low potential gap of 0.757 V. Additionally, the rechargeable Zn&#8208;air battery assembled with the (CoOx@NC)2&#8208;NiFe catalyst performs a peak power density of 136 mW cm&#8208;2, and a specific capacity of 803 mAh gZn&#8208;1 at 10 mA cm&#8208;2, and outstanding stability (over 200 h). This work presents a simple and low&#8208;cost approach for synthesizing bifunctional catalysts to realize efficient and durable rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfate Recognition in Water via Charge&#8208;Assisted Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving selective molecular recognition of hydrophilic anions in water remains a formidable challenge due to the competitive nature of water and the high hydration energies of target anions such as sulfate. Here, we report the design, synthesis, and characterization of a simple dicationic tetralactam macrocycle (BPTL2+&#183;2Cl&#8722;) capable of binding highly hydrated anions in water via charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonding. Structural, spectroscopic, thermodynamic, and computational studies reveal that BPTL2+ exhibits a strong binding affinity for sulfate (Ka = 2892 M&#8722;1), driven primarily by entropic gain from water release and reinforced by electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and DFT&#8208;optimized structures confirm the formation of directional [N&#8211;H&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;O] and [C&#8211;H&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;O] hydrogen bonds. Comparative studies with a control macrocycle (HCTL6&#8722;) that has a charge&#8208;neutral binding cavity underscore the essential role of cationic charge in overcoming desolvation enthalpic penalties. The receptor displays unusual anti&#8208;Hofmeister selectivity, preferentially binding more hydrophilic anions. This work provides fundamental insights into the mechanisms of anion recognition in water and establishes charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonding as a powerful strategy for developing next&#8208;generation receptors for sensing, separation, sequestration, transport, and catalysis in aqueous environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of a Deep&#8208;Red Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission&#8208;Active Iridium Complex for Plant Cell Wall Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plant cell wall imaging has received consistent attention in characterizing and monitoring the structure and health of plant tissues. To overcome current drawbacks of plant cell wall staining, such as source limitations, low specificity, auto&#8208;fluorescence interference, in this work we present the rational design of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active, deep&#8208;red emissive iridium complex as a specific staining agent of plant cell wall. Cell wall probe [Ir(dpyb)2(iqbtz)]+ (Ir&#8208;CW), bearing two rotatable pyridyl moieties, is designed to selective binding to pectin, one of the major components of the cell wall that carries rich carboxylic residues on its polymer chain. The AIE properties, pectin sensing behaviors, pectin binding mechanism and practical application of cell wall staining of Ir&#8208;CW are performed. Results demonstrate that Ir&#8208;CW exhibit pectin&#8208;responsive AIE properties and selective pectin binding against common interfering species including metal ions, anions, amino acids and saccharides. Notably, Ir&#8208;CW can specifically stain plant cell walls with better performance than Congo red, a commercial cell wall staining agent. This work highlights the rationales of developing novel iridium complexes for cell wall staining, and widely broadening their applications as powerful tools for botanical studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Ru&#8208;Catalyzed Deoxygenative Functionalization of Phenols via &#960;&#8208;Coordination Activation: Mechanochemical Access to N&#8208;Aryl Amides and &#945;&#8208;Aryl Carbonyls.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given the vast occurrence and availability of both primary amides and phenols, the synthesis of N&#8208;aryl amides via direct coupling between these starting materials would be much attractive. Herein, we report an efficient method for the mechanochemical synthesis of N&#8208;aryl amides via ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed direct amidation of unprotected phenols with primary amides with water as the sole byproduct. Unexpectedly, replacing amides with methyl carboxylic acids, esters, or ketones led to the formation of &#945;&#8208;aryl carbonyl derivatives instead of the anticipated aryl carboxylates. The synthetic strategy accepts a wide scope of primary amides, alkyl carbonyls and phenolic substrates to deliver the twenty&#8208;eight expected N&#8208;aryl amides and fourteen unexpected &#945;&#8208;aryl carbonyl derivatives with good to excellent yields. The developed synthetic approach would serve as the better alternative to the classical cross&#8208;coupling reactions in context to the PASE (pot, atom, and step economy) synthesis and late&#8208;stage modification of structurally complex molecules, including natural products and pharmaceuticals.</dc:description>

         <title>A convergent approach to resorcinolic macrolides to expand structural diversity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The resorcinolic macrolide (RM) family comprises over 50 natural products with diverse biological activities, including the potent natural Hsp90 inhibitor radicicol. Here, we report a modular and enantioselective synthetic strategy featuring a biomimetic macrocyclization&#8211;aromatization cascade that enables rapid access to natural and unnatural RMs. Using this route, we generated a small panel of minimal RMs, introducing covalent warheads, double bonds for macrocycle rigidification, and modifications at the C15 position, a position that has not been modified before. We also synthesized macrocyclic peptide&#8208;RM hybrids, offering a platform for rapid diversification. We evaluated all analogs for inhibitory activity against Hsp90&#945; and Hsp90&#946; and for disruption of the KRasG12C&#8211;CRAF protein&#8211;protein interaction (PPI). We found that introduction of polar groups at C15 improved Hsp90 activity relative to the representative RM de&#8208;O&#8208;methyllasiodiplodin, dependent on stereochemistry, whereas introduction of larger groups at C15 or introduction of a trans double bond into the macrocycle reduced activity. Two analogs with poor Hsp90 inhibitory activity exhibited dose&#8208;dependent inhibition of the KRasG12C&#8211;CRAF PPI. This work demonstrates that strategic modifications of a minimal RM scaffold through modular chemical insight can provide foundational structure&#8211;activity relationships for the class.</dc:description>

         <title>Arylboronic Acid Catalyzed Reductive Alkylation of Azoarenes to N&#8208;Alkylated Hydrazines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrazine derivatives are generally difficult to prepare despite their appealing structural simplicity. The synthetic challenge is likely to arise from either the similar reactivity or the relatively low activity of the two nitrogen&#8217;s in a hydrazine precursor. The former would lead to severe selectivity issues while the latter would require harsh reaction conditions. Herein, we have developed a new and efficient method for constructing N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;diarylhydrazines by arylboronic acid&#8208;catalyzed an one&#8208;pot tandem reduction of azoarene to hydrazoarene followed by reductive alkylation with the aldehyde and Hantzsch ester. The use of mild reaction conditions offers to provide tri&#8208;substituted hydrazine derivatives and suppress the N&#8208;N cleaved product amines and/or imines.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hydrazine derivatives are generally difficult to prepare despite their appealing structural simplicity. The synthetic challenge is likely to arise from either the similar reactivity or the relatively low activity of the two nitrogen&#8217;s in a hydrazine precursor. The former would lead to severe selectivity issues while the latter would require harsh reaction conditions. Herein, we have developed a new and efficient method for constructing N-alkyl-N,N&#8242;-diarylhydrazines by arylboronic acid-catalyzed an one-pot tandem reduction of azoarene to hydrazoarene followed by reductive alkylation with the aldehyde and Hantzsch ester. The use of mild reaction conditions offers to provide tri-substituted hydrazine derivatives and suppress the N-N cleaved product amines and/or imines. The reaction is highly chemoselective and tolerates a wide variety of hydrogenation-sensitive functional groups.

         <title>Chiral Cobaltabis(dicarbollide) Catalysts Prepared Using a Silica Helical Nanoplatform for the Enantioselective Photooxidation of Aromatic Secondary Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cobaltabis(dicarbollide) ([Co(C2B9H11)2]&#8208;) named COSAN has been widely explored in a variety of fields. While COSAN have recently been investigated in catalysis, their chiral counterparts have, to our knowledge, never been investigated in asymmetric catalysis. Inspired by our previous work on the chiral induction of silica helices on achiral objects, we prepared chiral COSAN&#8208;based hybrid silica nanohelices. In these structures, organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid nanohelices serves as a chiral platform for COSAN in enantioselective transformations. These NANOCOSAN were characterized using UV/Vis, Raman soectroscopy, TEM, EELS and NMR spectroscopy. Their optical activity was demonstrated by CD and ROA, highlighting the induction of chirality from chiral hybrid nanohelices to the achiral COSAN. To the best of our knowledge, these NANOCOSAN represent the first examples of COSAN&#8208;based chiral systems displaying chiroptical effects. They show excellent catalytic activity and enantioselectivity in the photooxidation of secondary aromatic alcohols, achieving up to 85% enantiomeric excess (ee). This catalytic experiment demonstrate the transfer of chiroptical properties from the nanohelices to the achiral COSAN, enabling supramolecular asymmetric catalysis. The catalyst was recovered and reused without any loss of catalytic activity or ee. This study reports the first example of COSAN&#8208;containing nanohelices which can promote photooxidation of organic substrates with high enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomimetic Growth of Calcium Oxalate Hydrates: Shape Development and Structures in Agar Gel Matrices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 25, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biomimetic growth of calcium oxalate hydrates is conducted using a double diffusion technique in agar gel. The results reveal the shape development of calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) and dihydrate (COD), resembling biominerals of kidney stones. The pH variations influence phase selection, with COM forming at lower pH and COD at higher pH. The findings offer insights into pathological biomineralization and urolithiasis.







Abstract
Crystal growth of calcium oxalate hydrates (COM: calcium oxalate monohydrate; COD: &#8208;dihydrate; COT: &#8208;trihydrate) is a specific example of pathological biomineralization due to their harmful role as kidney/urinary stones. In this work, the biomimetic growth of calcium oxalate hydrates has been achieved using double diffusion technique in agar gel matrix. In&#8197;vitro experimental models for the growth of calcium oxalates can give valuable information on the formation of biominerals of kidney/urinary stones. Diverse morphological forms of COM are grown in agar gel matrices ranging from platy crystallites to dumbbells and spherulites. The morphology of COM grown in agar gel resembles COM biominerals remarkably. Furthermore, it has been discovered that a higher pH of the agar gel promotes COD development while suppressing COM growth.

         <title>Lipase&#8208;Palladium Co&#8208;Catalyzed Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of Racemic Allylic Esters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 25, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhanced dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of racemic allylic esters has been explored using a lipase&#8208;palladium (Pd) co&#8208;catalysis system. By employing a monodentate phosphine ligand, P[C6H3&#8208;2,6&#8208;(OMe)2]3, and sodium acetate (NaOAc), the method achieves faster racemization and higher yields of optically active alcohols (93&#8211;99&#8201;% ee) with minimal side reactions, broadening substrate applicability and reaction efficiency.







Abstract
Dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) by combining lipase&#8208;catalyzed esterification of racemic sec&#8208;alcohols and in&#8197;situ racemization has been widely studied; however, reports on DKR involving lipase&#8208;catalyzed hydrolysis of racemic esters are scarce. This problem is probably due to the lack of more effective and general racemization methods. Herein, we report the enhanced hydrolytic DKR of racemic allylic esters. The discovery of the monodentate ligand P[C6H3&#8208;2,6&#8208;(OMe)2]3, which in&#8197;situ generates Pd complex(es) highly reactive to racemization and the NaOAc&#8208;mediated acceleration of racemization, are notable breakthroughs. Consequently, the DKR of racemic allylic esters can be completed in a few hours at 40&#8201;&#176;C in most cases, yielding optically active allylic alcohols (93&#8201;% ee to &gt;99&#8201;% ee) in 58&#8211;91&#8201;% isolated yields with minimal side reactions.

         <title>Delayed Fluorescence and Room Temperature Phosphorescence from a Liquid Arene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 25, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Homotruxene, a promising class of twisted polycyclic aromatic compounds, had its structure modified by insertion of branched alkoxy chains, resulting in the first report of a neat liquid presenting Triplet&#8208;Triplet Annihilation at room temperature, as well as phosphorescence lasting up to 50&#8197;ms.







Abstract
Delayed emission (DF) of fluorescence is generally observed either in solution or in the crystalline state. In the latter, well&#8208;defined intermolecular interactions may play a significant role in defining the emission characteristics. Here, we present a trialkoxy&#8208;homotruxene that is liquid at room temperature and compare its emission behavior with that of a crystalline analog containing the same &#960;&#8208;electron system. The DF observed is due to triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA) and persists at low temperatures (90&#8197;K). Accompanied by slightly shorter phosphorescence and DF lifetimes, the singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap increased by 4&#8201;% compared to the crystalline homolog. The replacement of methyl groups with racemic branched alkoxy chains in homotruxene derivatives proves efficient in suppressing crystallization without significantly altering DF. In neat films, the compound exhibited TTA&#8208;DF at room temperature, phosphorescence lasting up to 50&#8197;ms and Photoluminescence Quantum Yield (PLQY) of 24&#8201;%. Thus, TTA&#8208;DF persists in a single&#8208;component isotropic liquid phase, showing both molecular and aggregate emissions, only slightly affected by the absence of periodic molecular stacking.

         <title>Formal Umpolung Strategy for the Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Branched Amides via &#945;&#8208;Sulfenylnitro Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 25, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient umpolung strategy for synthesizing &#945;&#8208;branched amides using nitroalkenes, Grignard reagents, and amines has been developed. This strategy utilizes only readily available reagents. Key advances include the one&#8208;pot synthesis of &#945;&#8208;sulfenylnitroalkanes, optimized oxidative amidation, and a demonstration of a wide substrate scope. In addition, the sulfenylnitro scaffold offers notable advantages in terms of reactivity and stability.







Abstract
Amide compounds are essential structural motifs found in natural products, pharmaceuticals, peptides and materials. A novel formal umpolung strategy for an efficient synthesis of &#945;&#8208;branched amides was developed, employing nitroalkenes, Grignard reagents and amines as reacting components. The synthesis involves the formation of &#945;&#8208;sulfenylnitro intermediates, which undergo oxidative amidation under optimized conditions using tert&#8208;butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) as an oxidant and K2CO3 as a base. The key intermediate, an &#945;&#8208;sulfenylnitro compound, was successfully synthesized in a one&#8208;pot operation. This methodology demonstrates a broad substrate scope, accommodating various amines, including primary and secondary amines as well as amino acid derivatives, and yielding the corresponding &#945;&#8208;branched amides in high efficiency. The sulfenyl nitro scaffold proved particularly effective, offering both stability and reactivity. The developed process simplifies the preparation of &#945;&#8208;branched amides and expands the accessible structural diversity.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of [3]Rotaxanes with Two Oligo(para&#8208;phenylene) Axles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 25, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
[3]&#8208; and [2]rotaxanes with oligo(para&#8208;phenylene) axles were synthesized by Ni&#8208;mediated biaryl coupling. [3]Rotaxanes were synthesized in good yields when a larger macrocyclic Ni complex was employed. The spectroscopic properties and the aggregation behavior of octa(para&#8208;phenylene) derivatives were examined. The aggregated/non&#8208;aggregated state could be controlled by utilizing the interlocked structure.







Abstract
Oligo(para&#8208;phenylene) (PPn) is a &#960;&#8208;conjugated compound where phenylene units are directly connected at the 1,4&#8208;positions. Utilizing the catalytic activity of the macrocyclic dihydrodibenzophenanthroline&#8208;Ni complex, we succeeded in the synthesis of [3]&#8208; and [2]rotaxanes with PPn axles by biaryl coupling. The size of the macrocycle was critical to synthesize [3]rotaxanes, which consist of two oligo(para&#8208;phenylene) axles, in good yields. The relationship between the length of the PPn structure on the 1H NMR spectra of the rotaxanes was studied. The aggregation of a PP8 derivative was suppressed by the presence of the macrocycle in the rotaxanes. A [3]rotaxane could be considered as a model compound of an aggregated PPn, and the photophysical studies disclosed the influence of the aggregation on the properties of PPn.

         <title>A Tetrazine&#8208;Based Synthesis for Accessing Underutilized Aza&#8208;Indole Analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 25, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr)/Diels&#8211;Alder (DA)/retro Diels&#8211;Alder (rDA) reaction cascade has been developed to access pyrazolo[3,4&#8208;c]pyridazine compounds. These cores have been further derivatized through divergent, late&#8208;stage modifications to access various substitution patterns of the 3, 4, and 5 positions on the heterocyclic core.







Abstract
Aza&#8208;indole functionalities fill an important role in drug discovery. While indoles are considered privileged scaffolds, aza&#8208;indoles allow for better pharmacological properties and on&#8208;target activities. Synthetic approaches to access aza&#8208;indoles are limited, with pyrazolopyridazines being some of the scarcest aza&#8208;indoles. To provide access to these underutilized cores, a synthetic approach utilizing a reaction cascade between a protected propargylhydrazine and dichlorotetrazine has been developed. In addition, a variety of methods were developed to access each position on the core for late&#8208;stage functionalization. This method offers an expedited synthetic route to a rare aza&#8208;indole scaffold with superior physiochemical properties when compared to indole analogues.

         <dc:description>
Within the dynamic world of a chemistry lab, the exploration of time and light comes to life through the emissive processes of organic compounds. An unprecedented metal&#8208;free arene remains liquid over a wide temperature range and is the first example of a neat liquid showing delayed fluorescence in blue (TTA) and phosphorescence at room temperature in orange. The clock unravels time as its scale converges with liquid's light beam, depicting sequential emission shifting from one color to another. More information can be found in the Research Article by E. Westphal and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202404698).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 25, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
brGDGT Ia is one of the most common branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers produced by Acidobacteria as membrane&#8208;spanning lipids. These are used extensively by geochemists for paleoenvironmental studies. The image shows Acidobacteria colonies on an agar plate and the structure of brGDGT Ia with the elucidated syn configuration of the methyl branches, which was previously unknown. The Research Article by A.&#160;J. Minnaard and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202500702) describes the first total synthesis of the lipid and how the relative stereochemical configuration of the methyl branches was determined.

         <title>Cover Feature: Biomimetic Growth of Calcium Oxalate Hydrates: Shape Development and Structures in Agar Gel Matrices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 25, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature depicts the biomimetic growth of calcium oxalate hydrates (COM and COD) when using a double diffusion technique in an agar gel matrix. These hydrates are significant due to their role in kidney/urinary stone formation. Agar gel at pH&#160;8.5 grows COM dumbbells and spherulites, closely resembling biogenic calculi. At pH&#160;11.5, agar gel promotes the growth of COD aggregates, including COD dumbbells. Agar acts as either a mineralization promoter or inhibitor, depending on the pH, mimicking in&#8208;vivo conditions. More information can be found in the Research Article by P.&#160;A. Simon and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202404269).

         <title>Chiral Porous Organic Polymers (CPOPs): Design, Synthesis, and Applications in Asymmetric Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 25, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterogeneous chiral porous organic polymers (CPOPs) are novel emergent catalytic materials with robust chemical stability. CPOPs with tailor&#8208;made properties can be readily synthesized from simple programmed organic building blocks. This comprehensive review summarizes the design, synthesis, and applications of CPOPs for diverse enantioselective transformations. The fact that the CPOPs expand the repertoire of catalytic chiral porous materials in the arsenal of organic chemists for asymmetric synthesis is compellingly borne out.








Abstract
Since the recognition of the area of asymmetric synthesis in 2000, there has been a tremendous focus on the development of heterogeneous catalysts for asymmetric synthesis. Porous organic polymers (POPs) have emerged in recent years as inextricable materials of high physicochemical and hydrolytic stabilities, permitting infinite possibilities to modulate and tune reactivity, engineer porosity, regulate spatial environments and pore attributes, and maneuver material transport. With a diligent design of building blocks and the exploitation of organic reactions judiciously, the synthesis of POPs with BET surface areas of the order of a few thousand cm3/g has been demonstrated. The incorporation of reactive functional groups and chiral centers into the porous matrices of polymers offers opportunities to conduct asymmetric synthesis. Very high enantioselectivities of the order of 99% ee have been exemplified in the reactions mediated by chiral POPs (CPOPs). The design&#8208;driven tunability of POPs allows the development of catalytic materials for targeted applications in a tailor&#8208;made fashion. This review, while placing the development of chiral materials for asymmetric synthesis in the right perspective, delves into different design principles to pave the way for continued research on futuristic CPOP materials by a creative design, limited by one's imagination, for heretofore unprecedented results.

         <title>Slight&#8208;Crosslinking: Opening a New Journey for the Intrinsic Elastification of Ferroelectric Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 25, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the field of ferroelectric polymers, slight&#8208;crosslinking techniques have emerged as a crucial innovation, opening new avenues for the advancement of elastic electronics. This paper provides an in&#8208;depth exploration of diverse crosslinking methodologies, such as diamine crosslinking, carbene reaction, thiol&#8208;ene click reaction, and peroxide crosslinking. It reviews the key achievements in this field and highlights potential future research directions for further development.








Abstract
Elastic electronic materials are essential components in the next generation of wearable devices and soft robots. However, the development of elastic ferroelectric materials has lagged behind that of conductive and semiconductive materials. The successful realization of intrinsically elastic ferroelectrics through slight&#8208;crosslinking has opened a new path for making ferroelectric materials elastic. Given the critical need for materials that combine excellent elasticity with robust ferroelectric properties in the field of elastic electronics, we explore various crosslinking techniques and their performance characteristics. We believe that this cutting&#8208;edge research direction holds substantial value for both fundamental studies and practical applications.

         <title>Ene&#8208;Reductases&#8208;Catalyzed Non&#8208;Natural Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 25, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flavin&#8208;dependent ene&#8208;reductases catalyze a variety of non&#8208;natural reactions, operating in both hydride&#8208;transfer dependent and independent modes, beyond their native asymmetric reduction of C&#9552;C bonds. These reactions are primarily governed by the tunable redox states of the FMN cofactor and the synergistic interactions between conserved residues within the enzyme's active site.








Abstract
Flavin&#8208;dependent ene&#8208;reductases (EREDs), members of the Old Yellow Enzyme (OYE) superfamily, are highly efficient biocatalysts primarily known for catalyzing the asymmetric reduction of activated alkenes. Beyond this native function, the chemical versatility of the flavin cofactor and the sophisticated architecture of their protein structures enable EREDs to exhibit catalytic multifunctionality. The catalytic promiscuity not only highlights the adaptability of these enzymes but also expands their potential to broaden the scope of enzyme&#8208;catalyzed reactions in organic synthesis. Given the inherent challenges associated with discovering novel enzyme activities, such catalytic promiscuity of EREDs offers a promising pathway for expanding their applications. This mini&#8208;review provides a comprehensive overview of the catalytic multifunctionality of flavin&#8208;dependent EREDs, with a particular focus on their &#8220;non&#8208;natural&#8221; functionalities in organic synthesis. This review is primarily divided into two main sections: hydride&#8208;dependent reactions and hydride&#8208;independent reactions. By highlighting these unconventional biocatalytic pathways, we aim to inspire further exploration into the untapped potential of EREDs and their role in advancing synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Skeletal Rearrangements of Amides via Breaking Inert Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 25, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights advances in amide skeletal rearrangement reactions over the past two decades, categorized by the initial bond cleavages: C&#9472;N bond cleavage, C&#9472;C bond cleavage, and C&#9552;O bond activation. It summarizes emerging strategies, mechanistic insights, and synthetic applications, providing a focused perspective on recent developments in this field.








Abstract
Skeletal rearrangements of amides provide rapid access to complex nitrogen&#8208;containing scaffolds from simple readily available starting materials. While classical reactions such as the Hofmann and Curtius rearrangements have been widely utilized in organic synthesis, recent advances in amide activation strategies have brought new types of transformations and offered many new applications. This review focuses on the development of amide skeletal rearrangement reactions over the past two decades. The content is organized based on the initial bond cleavage pathways: C&#9472;N bond cleavage, C&#9472;C bond cleavage, and C&#9552;O bond activation.

         <title>Looking to the Future: Prospective Life Cycle Assessment of Emerging Technologies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 25, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores prospective life cycle assessment (pLCA), an emerging methodology for evaluating the environmental impacts of technologies still in development. Key aspects are identified, including assessing technology maturity levels, upscaling methods, and generating future scenarios. Recent case studies are analyzed to guide researchers in implementing robust pLCA frameworks for emerging technologies.








Abstract
Emerging technologies are expected to contribute to sustainable development, but assessing their future environmental impacts compared to current technologies remains challenging. Prospective life cycle assessment (pLCA) provides a systematic approach to evaluating emerging technologies throughout their life cycle and projecting impacts at future industrial scales. This review aims to identify critical aspects of pLCA methodologies and examine their implementation in recent case studies. Key aspects are highlighted: assessment of initial technology maturity, upscaling methods to model data at higher technology readiness levels, and development of future scenarios to contextualize the scaled&#8208;up systems. Specific upscaling techniques such as process simulation, engineering calculations and technology learning curves are discussed. Approaches to generating future scenarios in line with integrated assessment models and common socio&#8208;economic pathways are also analyzed. An in&#8208;depth literature review covering 2021&#8211;2024 publications categorizes 79 articles into literature reviews, methodological papers and pLCA case studies. The identified critical issues serve as a benchmark to assess the completeness and robustness of 20 case studies. Notable contributions, limitations and the need for comprehensive guidelines that integrate scenario development with upscaling methods are highlighted. This review provides valuable insights for researchers conducting pLCA studies of emerging technologies and materials.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Induced Single&#8208;Atom Insertion of Indenes via Aerobic Ring Scission&#8211;Condensation&#8211;Rearomatization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 25, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates a photocatalytic aerobic ring scission of indenes into dicarbonyl intermediates for efficient synthesis of isoquinoline derivatives via condensation/rearomatization event using NH4OAc as N source. Besides, naphthalene derivatives also can be archived through an elegant C atom insertion. Mechanistic studies reveal superoxide anion&#8208;mediated C&#9552;C cleavage rather than singlet oxygen

Abstract
In this study, we present a photocatalyzed single&#8208;atom insertion of indenes, involving an aerobic ring scission into dicarbonyl intermediates, which subsequently undergo condensation and rearomatization to efficiently synthesize isoquinoline and naphthalene derivatives. The use of an inexpensive organic dye as the photocatalyst under aerobic conditions with cheap ammonium acetate (NH4OAc) as the nitrogen source makes this method very practical and environmentally friendly to access isoquinoline. Alternatively, an intramolecular carbon&#8208;atom&#8208;insertion process, involving the Aldol reaction of the dicarbonyl intermediates, affords the naphthalenamine and naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ol derivatives. Mechanistic studies support that the superoxide anion radical species mediates the C&#9552;C double bond scission of indenes rather than the singlet oxygen intermediate.

         <title>Activation and Fixation of Atmospheric CO2 through a 1,2,3&#8208;Triazole&#8208;Based Mesoionic Carbene&#8211;Borane Adduct</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 25, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triazole&#8208;based mesoionic carbene (MIC)&#8211;borane compound captures atmospheric CO2 and converts it into formate. The rate and product formation of CO2 reduction is seen to be strongly dependent on the CO2 source with both formate and bicarbonate being produced with the same MIC&#8211;borane compound. A battery of spectroscopic methods was used to investigate the intermediates and understand the underlying mechanism.








Abstract
Capturing atmospheric CO2 and converting it to valuable chemicals are important goals in contemporary science. We present here a simple, transition metal&#8208;free triazolylidene&#8211;borane adduct that can capture atmospheric CO2 and convert it to formate. Several key intermediates were isolated and characterized by a combination of multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. A first closed cycle for the conversion of CO2 to formic acid by using the aforementioned triazolylidene&#8211;borane compound is presented as well.

         <title>Enhancing Photocatalytic and Antibacterial Properties Through a Synergistic Approach in ZnS&#8211;CuSe Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 25, May 5, 2025. </description>

CZ&#8208;3 nanocomposite is used for methylene blue (MB) dye degradation under visible light. The process involves electron transfer from ZnS to CuSe, generating reactive radicals (&#8226;O2&#8208; and &#8226;OH) that effectively degrade MB and antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus subtilis. CZ&#8208;3 exhibited 98% photocatalytic efficiency and strong antibacterial activity, signifying its potential for environmental remediation and healthcare applications.








Abstract
This study introduces a novel single&#8208;step sonochemical synthesis method for producing pure ZnS and CuSe. It offers a comprehensive report on the fabrication of ZnS&#9472;CuSe nanocomposites with varying compositions (90, 70, and 50% ZnS combined with 10, 30, and 50% CuSe), denoted as CZ&#8208;1, CZ&#8208;2, and CZ&#8208;3, via a wet&#8208;chemical method. Comprehensive characterization was conducted to assess phase purity, structural integrity, composition, detection of free radicals, and optical properties. The results revealed that the average crystallite sizes of ZnS and CuSe were 46.91 and 20.31 nm, respectively. Morphological analysis showed CuSe formed nanoflakes, whereas ZnS appeared as nanoparticles. Optical properties revealed a red shift in absorption spectra and a decrease in band gap with increasing CuSe concentration. Electrons in the CBM (conduction band minimum) can be captured by &#8226;O2 to produce large amounts of &#8226;O2&#8208; and &#8226;OH radicals, formed via &#8226;O2&#8208; &#8594;H2O2 &#8594;&#8226;OH. DFT calculations support these findings, offering insights into how CuSe affects the electronic structure of ZnS. Among the materials, CZ&#8208;3 showed superior photocatalytic activity, achieving 98% degradation of methylene blue (MB) dye and effective inhibition of B. subtilis and P. aeruginosa under visible light irradiation.

         <title>Synthesis of &#946;,&#946;&#8208;Dinaphthyl Amino Acids: Towards Molecular Gearing in Peptides and Mini&#8208;Proteins</title>

Amino acids bearing two aromatic side chains are studied here for their ability to align in rotor&#8208;like assemblies in a synthetic protein. Based on quantitative analysis of 1H NMR reference nuclei, we investigate a correlated molecular rotor&#8208;type behavior whose dynamic nature stands in remarkable contrast to established systems in the field of molecular bionics.








Abstract
We report the synthesis of &#946;,&#946;&#8208;dinaphthyl amino acids by directed CH&#8208;activation and their subsequent utilization in peptides. The synthesis of aromatic &#946;&#8208;branched amino acids is limited by sterical crowding for large aromatic ring systems. The amino acids are transformed into adequately protected building blocks for solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis by using our amide weakening strategy. Our aim was to study the interactions of the side chain aryl groups in solution and solid state. Based on quantitative analysis of 1H NMR reference nuclei, we investigate conformational equilibria and compare them to established gearing systems.

         <title>Should I stay or should I flow? An exploration of phase&#8208;separated metallosupramolecular liquid crystal polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 25, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metallosupramolecular liquid crystal polymers (MSLCPs) were synthesized whose architecture and subsequent thermomechanical and viscoelastic properties could be tuned based on the choice of metal salt. These materials displayed high stress relaxation and bulk flow behavior making them prime candidates to study as adhesives. These MSLCP materials displayed robust adhesive character in both the pressure&#8208;sensitive and hot melt adhesive modes






.

Abstract
Dynamic liquid crystalline polymers (dLCPs) incorporate both liquid crystalline mesogens and dynamic bonds into a single polymeric material. These dual functionalities impart order&#8208;dependent thermo&#8208;responsive mechano&#8208;optical properties and enhanced reprocessability/programmability enabling their use as soft actuators, adaptive adhesives, and damping materials. While many previous works studying dynamic LCPs utilize dynamic covalent bonds, metallosupramolecular bonds provide a modular platform where a series of materials can be accessed from a single polymeric feedstock through the variation of the metal ion used. A series of dLCPs were prepared by the addition of metal salts to a telechelic 2,6&#8208;bisbenzimidazolylpyridine (Bip) ligand endcapped LCP to form metallosupramolecular liquid crystal polymers (MSLCPs). The resulting MSLCPs were found to phase separate into hard and soft phases which aids in their mechanical robustness. Variations of the metal salts used to access these materials allowed for control of the thermomechanical, viscoelastic, and adhesive properties with relaxations that can be tailored independently of the mesogenic transition. This work demonstrates that by accessing phase separation through the incorporation of metallosupramolecular moieties, highly processable yet robust MSLCP materials can be realized. This class of materials opens the door to LCPs with bulk flow behavior that can also be utilized as multi&#8208;level adhesives.

         <title>Molecular Recognition and Chiral Discrimination from NMR and Multi&#8208;Scale Simulations</title>

This study explores the enantioselective discrimination of mandelic acid enantiomers using (R)&#8208;BINOL and (S)&#8208;BINOL through a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance experiments, molecular dynamics simulations, and quantum mechanical calculations. The findings provide a detailed understanding of the diffusion properties and binding interactions that drive chiral recognition at the molecular level.








Abstract
Chiral molecules are particularly interesting to the pharmaceutical and agrochemical sectors due to their chemical and physical properties. Separation and identification of enantiomers are critical for a broad range of compounds, and discriminating stereoisomers in solution remains a key analytical challenge. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) with Matrix&#8208;Assisted Diffusion&#8208;Ordered Spectroscopy (MAD), in the presence of chiral resolving agents, has emerged as a tool to explore these chiral mixtures. However, insight into the intermolecular interactions that lead to chiral recognition is still limited. Here, we combine experimental MAD studies with computational approaches to investigate the enantioselective discrimination of Mandelic Acid (MA) enantiomers using (R)&#8208;BINOL and (S)&#8208;BINOL. Molecular dynamics simulations explain the differences in diffusion coefficients for heterochiral complexes. Furthermore, quantum mechanical calculations confirmed enantioselective binding preferences due to differences in Gibbs free energies, highlighting the fundamental interactions and structural criteria that explain the NMR shielding and the diffusion trends. This integrated approach bridges experimental and theoretical studies, offering a comprehensive understanding of chiral recognition mechanisms and elucidating the observed heterochiral preference of BINOL for MA enantiomers. Our findings advance the field of chiral analysis and lay a foundation for future developments for identifying stereoisomers and recognition modes underlying enantioselective binding.

We report the design, synthesis and studies on two heptazine core&#8208;based C3 symmetric tripodal photoswitchable systems towards photo&#8208;tuned smart molecular materials.








Abstract
Electron&#8208;deficient heptazine&#8208;based molecular and polymeric materials are a fast&#8208;growing area of research with their exciting electronic and optical properties, finding potential applications in catalysis, optoelectronics etc. However, the continuous thirst for the design of heptazine&#8208;core&#8208;based molecular systems has grown in interest in the search for a new class of materials. Herein, we have synthesized two heptazine core&#8208;based C3&#8208;symmetric tripodal molecular systems decorated with three azobenzene and phenylazo&#8208;3,5&#8208;dimethylisoxazole as photoswitchable units connected through &#9472;NH linker. The photoswitching characteristics and thermal half&#8208;lives of photoswitched states were studied using UV&#8211;vis and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. In addition, for azobenzene derivative 1, intriguing properties such as reversible sonication&#8208;induced gelation and base sensing ability have been demonstrated and supported by computations.

         <title>Hydrophosphanylation of Alkynes via Magnesium Complexes: Evidence for Ligand Dependency in Structure&#8211;Activity Relationships</title>

Demonstration of a well&#8208;defined magnesium complex achieving the hydrophosphanylation of alkynes and alkenes that delivers a cutting&#8208;edge, eco&#8208;friendly solution for crafting vital C&#9472;P bonds efficiently, beyond transition&#8211;metal catalysts.








Abstract
Pursuing practical, straightforward, and sustainable methods for forming carbon&#8208;phosphorus bonds is crucial in academia and industry. In this study, we showed that bis(diiminate)&#8208;based magnesium complexes [L(Mg&#8208;nBu)2] (nBu&#160;=&#160;n&#8208;butyl) could effectively catalyze the hydrophosphanylation of alkynes, resulting in monophosphanylated vinyledene&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;diphosphanylated alkanes in a stepwise manner. This transformation showcases an excellent atom economy, broad functional group tolerance, and gram&#8208;scale synthesis for organophosphorus compounds. Through controlled experiments and with the support of DFT calculations, we elucidated the reaction mechanism, identifying the active catalytic species and revealing a stepwise hydrophosphanylation process of alkynes. Although complex Mg&#8208;1 showed its potential in this transformation, complexes Mg&#8208;2 and Mg&#8208;3, having ethyl and phenyl spacers, produced a lower yield of hydrophosphanylated products, indicating the role of ligand (spacer) in this catalytic reaction. Further, the activity of Mg&#8208;1 was compared with a monomeric magnesium complex, Mg&#8208;4, and it was found that the performance of the Mg&#8208;4 in alkyne hydrophosphanylation is quite lower than the results obtained by using Mg&#8208;1. This work demonstrated that a dimeric magnesium complex with a suitable spacer can enhance the catalytic activity manyfolds in the hydrophosphanylation of alkynes.

&lt;p&gt;Pursuing practical, straightforward, and sustainable methods for forming carbon-phosphorus bonds is crucial in academia and industry. In this study, we showed that bis(diiminate)-based magnesium complexes [L(Mg-&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;Bu)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;Bu&#160;=&#160;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-butyl) could effectively catalyze the hydrophosphanylation of alkynes, resulting in monophosphanylated vinyledene- and 1,2-diphosphanylated alkanes in a stepwise manner. This transformation showcases an excellent atom economy, broad functional group tolerance, and gram-scale synthesis for organophosphorus compounds. Through controlled experiments and with the support of DFT calculations, we elucidated the reaction mechanism, identifying the active catalytic species and revealing a stepwise hydrophosphanylation process of alkynes. Although complex &lt;b&gt;Mg-1&lt;/b&gt; showed its potential in this transformation, complexes &lt;b&gt;Mg-2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Mg-3,&lt;/b&gt; having ethyl and phenyl spacers, produced a lower yield of hydrophosphanylated products, indicating the role of ligand (spacer) in this catalytic reaction. Further, the activity of &lt;b&gt;Mg-1&lt;/b&gt; was compared with a monomeric magnesium complex, &lt;b&gt;Mg-4&lt;/b&gt;, and it was found that the performance of the &lt;b&gt;Mg-4&lt;/b&gt; in alkyne hydrophosphanylation is quite lower than the results obtained by using &lt;b&gt;Mg-1&lt;/b&gt;. This work demonstrated that a dimeric magnesium complex with a suitable spacer can enhance the catalytic activity manyfolds in the hydrophosphanylation of alkynes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Redox Cycle of Viologen&#8208;Based Porous Organic Polymers for High&#8208;Performance Hydrogen Peroxide Photosynthesis</title>

Inspired by natural photosynthesis, the redox&#8208;active moiety of MV2+ was introduced into POPs. As a strong electron acceptor, MV2+ can rapidly capture electrons, promoting the separation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic efficiency for H2O2 production. TPE&#8208;MV demonstrated excellent performance in photocatalytic water splitting, highlighting the crucial role of MV2+ in the photocatalytic process.








Abstract
Harnessing solar energy to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an important strategy to address the current energy shortage. Among various materials, porous organic polymers (POPs) stand out as promising candidates for photocatalytic H2O2 generation due to their versatile structures and extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation; however, their efficiency in H2O2 synthesis is often constrained by poor charge separation and high reaction energy barriers. To address these challenges, we drew inspiration from the redox reactions of coenzyme NADPH in natural photosynthesis, the redox&#8208;active methyl viologen (MV2+) moiety was rationally incorporated into two polymer frameworks (TPE&#8208;MV and TPB&#8208;MV) as pivotal active sites for photocatalytic oxygen (O2) reduction to H2O2 via the reversible redox cycle of MV2+ and zerovalent methyl viologen (MV0). Through this redox cycle, MV2&#8314; accepts two photogenerated electrons, reducing it to MV&#8304;. MV&#8304; sequentially reduces O&#8322; to H&#8322;O&#8322; while regenerating MV2&#8314;. Mechanistic studies show that this approach effectively suppresses charge recombination and lowers the reaction energy barriers. Consequently, the photocatalytic H&#8322;O&#8322; generation rates of TPE&#8208;MV and TPB&#8208;MV reached 6068 and 2015&#160;&#181;mol g&#8315;&#185; h&#8315;&#185;, respectively. This work offers a new strategy for designing efficient photocatalysts by incorporating biomimetic redox&#8208;active moieties to enhance solar energy utilization for H2O2 production.

         <title>The Use of Deep Eutectic Solvents for the Synthesis of Iron Oxides Nanoparticles: A Driving Force for Materials Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 25, May 5, 2025. </description>

Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs) structurally directed the growth of technologically relevant Iron Oxide Nanoparticles (IONs) towards magnetic (magnetite) or non&#8208;magnetic (hematite) crystal structures, according to their intrinsic properties.








Abstract
In this study, we explored the use of Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs) as a green and sustainable alternative for the synthesis of Iron Oxide Nanoparticles (IONs). Six different binary mixtures of Hydrogen Bond Acceptors (HBAs) and Donors (HBDs) were prepared and thoroughly characterized to investigate how their components and physicochemical properties influence the structure, morphology, and magnetic properties of the resulting IONs. In addition, the role of DESs was assessed using ATR&#8208;MIR spectroscopy, providing insights into HBA&#8208;HBD interactions with iron precursors. The study highlights the critical role of DES constituents, particularly the interactions between HBAs and HBDs, in directing nanoparticle size, structure, and morphology. Indeed, our results demonstrate that the choice of DES significantly impacts the crystalline phase of iron oxide nanoparticles, yielding either magnetite (Fe&#8323;O&#8324;) or hematite (&#945;&#8208;Fe&#8322;O&#8323;). These findings established a robust framework for leveraging DES in nanomaterial synthesis, paving the way for more environmentally friendly approaches in diverse industrial and scientific applications.

         <title>TiNiSi&#8208;Type ALiAu (A = Ca, Sr, Ba, Eu, Yb) Compounds: Alternative Use of &#8220;Excess&#8221; Electrons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 25, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excess electrons distinguish the bonding in ALiAu (A = Yb, Ca, Eu, Sr, Ba), a new series of intermetallic compounds crystallizing in TiNiSi type. According to bonding analysis, these metallic phases are classified as aurides containing polycations with multiatomic bonding between A, Li, and Au






.

Abstract
New TiNiSi&#8208;type compounds ALiAu (A = Ca, Sr, Ba, Eu, Yb) were obtained in the form of mm&#8208;sized single crystals by high&#8208;temperature centrifugation&#8208;aided filtration from lithium melt. They are the first examples of TiNiSi&#8208;type representatives containing Li and a transition metal. The metallic phases show paramagnetic (Ca) or diamagnetic (Sr, Ba, Yb) behavior or antiferromagnetic ordering below 19 K (Eu). A new structural description is based on a hexagonal close packing with A occupying all octahedral and Li occupying half of the tetrahedral voids in an ordered fashion. Chemical bonding analysis supports the structural description and reveals the formation of eight&#8208;atomic stella&#8211;quadrangula bonds pinned on the empty tetrahedral holes, a bonding picture known from elemental metals.

         <title>A Deep Eutectic Solvent Electrolyte Enables Planar Cu Deposition and High&#8208;Temperature Cu&#8211;MnO2 Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 25, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deep eutectic solvent (DES) electrolyte composed of choline chloride and urea exhibits superior high&#8208;temperature resistance compared with the aqueous electrolyte. A high&#8208;temperature Cu&#8211;MnO2 full cell with the DES electrolyte is able to maintain a capacity of 174.8 mAh g&#8722;1 after 300 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1, demonstrating great potential for application under harsh conditions. 








Abstract
Cu anodes exhibit a higher theoretical specific capacity (843 mAh g&#8722;1 or 7558 mAh cm&#8722;3) than Zn anodes (820 mAh g&#8722;1 or 5855 mAh cm&#8722;3), and have garnered widespread attention. However, aqueous Cu&#8208;ion batteries suffer from severe Cu dendrite growth, limited cycle life, and poor high&#8208;temperature performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a deep eutectic solvent (DES) electrolyte is proposed to address these issues. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations confirm that the DES electrolyte coordinates with Cu2+, thereby modulating the Cu deposition behavior. Consequently, planar deposition and extended cycle life (6000&#160;h versus 730&#160;h) are achieved. Furthermore, the DES electrolyte exhibits the promising application potential under harsh conditions. A high&#8208;temperature Cu&#9472;MnO2 full cell retains a capacity of 174.8 mAh g&#8722;1 after 300 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1 under 50 &#176;C.

A high-temperature Cu&#9472;MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; full cell retains a capacity of 174.8 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 300 cycles at 2 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under 50 &#176;C.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Heteroleptic Amidinato Calcium Halides via the In&#8208;Situ Grignard Addition Method (iGAM) Complementing the Metalation of Amidines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 25, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in&#8208;situ generation of Grignard&#8208;type organocalcium reagents via the reduction of alkyl and aryl halides in THF and their immediate use for subsequent addition onto carbodiimides allows the synthesis of hitherto unknown amidinates of calcium.








Abstract
The in&#8208;situ Grignard addition method adds intermediately prepared organo alkaline&#8208;earth metal halides onto a suitable substrate. Here, freshly rasped calcium and the carbodiimide R&#8242;&#9472;N&#9552;C&#9552;N&#9472;R&#8242; (R&#8242; = SiMe3, iPr) are suspended in THF at room temperature and then an organyl halide R&#9472;X (X = Br, I) is added. Within several hours, intermediately formed R&#9472;Ca&#9472;X adds onto the carbodiimide yielding the corresponding thf adducts of the amidinato calcium halide {(R&#8242;N)2C&#9472;R}CaX. Suitable organyl halides besides aryl iodide are methyl and ethyl halide whereas bulkier isopropyl and tert&#8208;butyl iodides give very low yields.

         <title>New Thermoelectricity Utilization System Based on Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Battery Involving the Tripyridinium&#8211;Triazine Radicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 25, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new thermoelectricity utilization system is established using tripyridinium&#8211;triazine compound for low&#8208;grade heat harvesting. The thermally induced potential shift arises from temperature&#8208;dependent interconversion between singlet and triplet states of the tripyridinium&#8211;triazine diradical.








Abstract
New energy technology is in urgent demand for waste heat harvesting and utilization for energy saving and renewable energy development. Herein, an aqueous organic redox flow battery (AORFB) with designed tripyridinium&#8211;triazine radicals ((TPyTz)&#183;&#183;4+)/(TPyTz)&#183;5+) as the negative redox couple is constructed as a thermoelectricity utilization system. The electrochemical test indicates that the (TPyTz)&#183;&#183;4+/(TPyTz)&#183;5+ couple shows an interesting potential change about 27&#160;mV accompanied by system temperature varying from 298&#160;K to 343&#160;K. Nuclear magnetic resonance and electron paramagnetic resonance spectra approve that the population of high&#8208;energy (TPyTz)&#183;&#183;4+ triplet state increases with temperature rise. This shifts the potential of the (TPyTz)&#183;&#183;4+/(TPyTz)&#183;5+ couple to a much more negative position. While the 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl derivative (TPABPy)Cl3 is used as the positive electrolyte with no temperature&#8208;dependent potential change, the AORFB established by these two couples displays a thermally induced potential change from 1.39&#160;V to 1.42&#160;V.

Vinyl&#8208;terminated oligodimethylsiloxane chains are grafted on the interlayer surfaces of a crystalline layered silicate. Delaminated nanosheets are used as novel siloxane&#8208;based nanobuilding blocks to produce nanocomposite silicone elastomers.








Abstract
Crystalline layered silicates are valuable precursors for the synthesis of functional siloxane&#8208;based nanomaterials. In this study, vinyl&#8208;terminated oligodimethylsiloxane was grafted onto the interlayer surfaces of a crystalline layered silicate, octosilicate. The oligosiloxane modification facilitated the delamination of the layers in hydrophobic organic solvents. Hydrosilylation reactions between the oligosiloxane&#8208;modified nanosheets and SiH&#8208;terminated polydimethylsiloxane resulted in a clear, stretchable elastomer, demonstrating that the nanosheets acted as cross&#8208;linkers. Furthermore, the introduction of silanolate groups into the elastomer imparted self&#8208;healing properties. These findings expand the potential of crystalline layered silicates as nanobuilding blocks for new materials.

Abstract
Glycans are biologically important molecules that are difficult to synthesize and analyze due to their structural diversity and conformational flexibility. Stereoselective glycosylation reactions are key to achieving high&#8208;yielding glycan syntheses. The stereochemical outcome of glycosylations is significantly influenced by factors such as the choice of activator and leaving group systems, solvent type, temperature, concentration, and stoichiometry. We introduce a flow chemistry approach to efficiently screen glycosylation conditions, using minimal material and time to enable a rapid design&#8208;make&#8208;test&#8208;analyze cycle with precise parameter control for reaction optimization. Ion mobility spectrometry provides rapid separation and analysis of crude glycosylation reaction mixtures that requires less method development than liquid chromatography thus making it a valuable tool for optimizing glycosylation reactions.

         <title>Models for the Anionic Polymerization of P&#9552;C Bonds: Cyclization of n&#8208;BuLi&#8208;Initiated MesP&#9552;CPh2 and Related Phosphaalkenes with H2C&#9552;CPh2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 25, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Noninnocence of P&#8208;Mesityl substituent, cleavage of a P&#9552;C bond and cyclization are observed in reactions of five phosphaalkenes. The observed activation of the C&#9472;H bond of the Mesityl substituent and subsequent addition to nonpolymerizable H2C&#9552;CPh2 is examined as a potential clue to the polymerization mechanism for P&#8208;Mesityl phosphaalkenes.








Abstract
To model the first propagation step in the anionic polymerization of MesP&#9552;CPh2 we studied the addition of Li[MesP(Bu)&#8211;CPh2] (and related species) to nonpolymerizable H2C&#9552;CPh2. Addition proceeds via the o&#8208;CH3 of the P&#8208;Mes followed by unprecedented cyclization to C5P&#8208;rings with release of Li[CHPh2]. Further investigation of the aforementioned reaction using phosphaalkenes, RP&#9552;CAr2 (R &#9552; Mes, m&#8208;Xyl; R&#8242; &#9552; Ph, 4&#8208;FC6H4, 4&#8208;MeC6H4, 4&#8208;MeOC6H4), resulted in the observation of a relatively long&#8208;lived intermediate in two instances (R &#9552; Mes, R&#8217; = 4&#8208;MeC6H4, 4&#8208;MeOC6H4). For the latter, the intermediate was identified as n&#8208;BuP(CH(4&#8208;MeOC6H4)2)[C6(4,6&#8208;Me2)H2&#8211;(2&#8208;CH2CH2CPh2Li) by isolation of the oxidized, H+&#8208;quenched product. These observations provide intriguing clues into the complex mechanism of polymerization of P&#8208;Mes phosphaalkenes and the chiral cyclophosphane products are of interest as ligands for catalytic applications.

&lt;p&gt;Noninnocence of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;-Mesityl substituent, cleavage of a P&#9552;C bond and cyclization are observed in reactions of five phosphaalkenes. The observed activation of the C&#9472;H bond of the Mesityl substituent and subsequent addition to nonpolymerizable H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&#9552;CPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is examined as a potential clue to the polymerization mechanism for &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;-Mesityl phosphaalkenes.

         <title>Head&#8208;to&#8208;Tail Packing to Facilitate [2+2] Cycloaddition for Green Synthesis of Cyclobutane Derivatives in Specific Configuration</title>

         <dc:description>
Crystalline molecular pairs exhibiting head&#8208;to&#8208;tail packing configurations of diphenylpenta&#8208;2,4&#8208;dienenitrile derivatives have been observed to facilitate solid&#8208;state photo&#8208;induced [2+2] cycloadditions, demonstrating remarkable reactivity, stereospecificity, regiospecificity, and chemoselectivity. Such packing arrangements are advantageous as they reduce the activation energy of the reaction and provide more robust intermolecular interactions in comparison to head&#8208;to&#8208;head packed configurations

Abstract
Topological [2+2] cycloaddition is known to provide a convenient synthetic route for cyclobutane derivatives from favorably dispositioned dienes. In this study, new (2Z,4E)&#8208;2&#8208;(2,4&#8208;difluorophenyl)&#8208;5&#8208;phenylpenta&#8208;2,4&#8208;dienenitrile (HDE), (2Z,4E)&#8208;2&#8208;(2,4&#8208;difluorophenyl)&#8208;5&#8208;(p&#8208;tolyl)penta&#8208;2,4&#8208;dienenitrile (MeDE), (2Z,4E)&#8208;5&#8208;(4&#8208;chlorophenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;(2,4&#8208;difluorophenyl)penta&#8208;2,4&#8208;dienenitrile (ClDE), (2Z,4E)&#8208;5&#8208;(4&#8208;bromophenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;(2,4&#8208;difluorophenyl)penta&#8208;2,4&#8208;dienenitrile (BrDE), (2Z,4E)&#8208;2&#8208;(2,4&#8208;difluorophenyl)&#8208;5&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl) penta&#8208;2,4&#8208;dienenitrile (MeODE), and (2Z,4E)&#8208;2&#8208;(2,4&#8208;difluorophenyl)&#8208;5&#8208;(4&#8208;(dimethylamino)phenyl)penta&#8208;2,4&#8208;dienenitrile (MeNDE) were synthesized, and their reactivity and selectivity were investigated in relation to their molecular packing in the respective crystals. HDE and MeDE, with head&#8208;to&#8208;tail (HT) arrangement, yielded only one type of photodimer. On the contrary, ClDE and BrDE, with head&#8208;to&#8208;head (HH) packing, and where the &#8220;olefin pairs&#945;,&#946;&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8221; and &#8220;olefin pairs&#947;,&#948;&#8208;&#947;,&#948;&#8221; satisfy Schimdt's criteria, reacted to a mixture of photoproducts. Kinetics analysis suggests that the reaction rates of HDE and MeDE are higher than those of ClDE and BrDE. This observation may be due to the strong non&#8208;covalent interactions between the potentially reactive olefin pairs as suggested by energy decomposition analysis. Furthermore, the reaction activation energies for photodimerization of the HT&#8208;packed olefin pairs are indeed lower than those of the HH&#8208;arranged ones. The HT packing of the diphenyldienes not only enhances the reactivity in the topological [2+2] cycloaddition but also contributes chemospecificity, regiospecifity, and stereospecificity, all of which are essential for the preparation of specific cyclobutanes derivatives based on photodimerization.

         <title>A Photoswitchable Chloride&#8208;Binding [2]Rotaxane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 25, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A [2]rotaxane receptor for chloride containing a stiff&#8208;stilbene photoswitch in the macrocyclic ring can be switched between Z&#8208; and E&#8208;isomers using 340/385&#160;nm light. This brings about a change in motional dynamics as well as binding affinity. The presented approach is expected to facilitate photocontrolled extractions and transport with high chloride selectivity.








Abstract
Control over the binding properties of anion receptors by external stimuli can be advantageous in various applications such as extraction and transport processes. Toward a light&#8208;responsive anion receptor with high binding affinity and selectivity, a stiff&#8208;stilbene photoswitch is incorporated into the macrocycle of a mechanically interlocked, chloride&#8208;binding [2]rotaxane structure. UV&#8208;Vis and 1H NMR studies show reversible transformation between Z/E&#8208;isomers upon light irradiation, causing changes in motional dynamics and binding affinity. Photoswitching also takes place in the presence of chloride, as monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy, which results in its concomitant uptake and release. Our results show the suitability of rotaxanes as light&#8208;responsive ion receptors, which could serve as prototypes for supramolecular pumps.

         <title>A Biocompatible Cinchonine&#8208;Based Catalyst for the CO2 Valorization into Oxazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ones Under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 25, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple derivative of the natural alkaloid (+)&#8208;cinchonine promoted the cycloaddition of CO2 to aziridines at room temperature and atmospheric CO2 pressure without the aid of any cocatalyst. Oxazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ones were obtained in high yields and regioselectivities employing a highly accessible procedure that does not require any specific equipment.








Abstract
A metal&#8208;free, biocompatible catalyst for the cycloaddition of CO2 to N&#8208;alkyl aziridines was easily obtained by protonating the natural and nontoxic alkaloid (+)&#8208;cinchonine. This bifunctional catalytic system promoted the synthesis of the desired products under very mild experimental conditions (room temperature and atmospheric CO2 pressure) and without the aid of any cocatalyst. No specific equipment is required, making the procedure practical for application in any laboratory. The high synthetic value of this methodology can be attributed to the combination of excellent regioselectivity in oxazolidinone synthesis and the remarkable chemical stability of the catalyst, which can be recycled and reused for at least three consecutive cycles without any significant loss of activity.

         <title>A Photochromic Dysprosium Compound Supported by &#946;&#8208;Diketone Dithienylethene Ligand</title>

A photochromic zero&#8208;filed dysprosium single&#8208;molecule magnet supported by &#946;&#8208;diketone dithienylethene ligand possessing extremely high crystallinity and decomposition temperature was designed and magnetically investigated.








Abstract
Air&#8208;stable lanthanide single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) with photochromic units, e.g. dithienylethene (DTE), anthracene, and polyoxometalates (POMs) have attracted considerable attentions in the field of molecular magnetism as they could increase the range of applications of magnetic molecules. However, the number of photochromic lanthanide SMMs is scarce. Inspired by a boron&#8208;based molecule featuring near&#8208;infrared absorption supported by a DTE&#8208;containing &#946;&#8208;diketonate ligand (3ThacacH) reported by Vivian Wing&#8208;Wah Yam et&#160;al., in this work, we employed this ligand to lanthanide systems for the first time constructing an air&#8208;stable mononuclear Dy(III)&#8208;based compound, Dy(o&#8208;3Thacac)3phen. It is a typical zero&#8208;field SMM with the anisotropy barrier approaching 100 K. Its reversible photochromic behaviors in solution were determined by UV&#8208;Vis absorption and 1H NMR spectra. The inevitable byproducts upon UV irradiation combined with the low yield of photocyclization reaction lead to the incomplete photochromism in a solid state. However, distinct relaxation rates of quantum tunneling of the magnetization between Dy(o&#8208;3Thacac)3phen and the irradiated sample were observed, demonstrating the feasibility of using 3ThacacH to modulate magnetodynamics. Meanwhile, this work highlights the vital roles of avoiding photoinduced byproducts, achieving photochromic single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation, and high yields of photocyclization/photocycloreversion reaction in elucidating the photo&#8208;responsive relaxation mechanism and future device applications.

Bioorthogonal functionalization in the minor groove of DNA with 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine as target is performed. Cyclopropene and heptene embedded in 2&#8208;amino protecting groups serve as dienophiles and 3,6&#8208;dipyridyl&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazine as diene in inverse&#8208;electron demand Diels&#8208;Alder reactions. Pyridazine adducts attached to the 2&#8208;position of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine by a long linker are well&#8208;accomodated in the minor groove of DNA.








Abstract
Bioorthogonal functionalization in the minor groove of DNA with protected 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine (2&#8208;amino&#8208;dA, 1) as a target site is described. Cyclopropene and heptene as part of 2&#8208;aminoacyl protecting groups served as dienophiles in inverse&#8208;electron demand Diels&#8208;Alder (iEDDA) reactions with 3,6&#8208;dipyridyl&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazine as diene. For the purpose, bis&#8208;protection of 1 with cyclopropenyl and heptenoyl groups was conducted. Selective removal of the 6&#8208;amino protecting groups gave mono&#8208;protected 1. 2&#8208;Amino&#8208;dA pyridazine conjugates were accessed by iEDDA cycloaddition with tetrazine. Second order rate constants disclosed faster reaction kinetics for cyclopropenyl than for heptenoyl 2&#8208;amino&#8208;dA. To access protected oligonucleotides, phosphoramidites prepared from bis&#8208;protected 2&#8208;amino&#8208;dA were used in standard solid&#8208;phase synthesis. 2&#8208;Amino protecting groups were retained using mild deprotection conditions. Hybridization experiments disclosed increased duplex stability when protected 2&#8208;amino&#8208;dA&#8208;dT pairs replaced 1&#8208;dT pairs. Mismatch discrimination of cyclopropenyl and heptenoyl 2&#8208;amino&#8208;dA was superior to 2&#8208;amino&#8208;dA. iEDDA reactions on protected oligonucleotides furnished oligonucleotide pyridazine conjugates. In base pairs with dT, 2&#8208;amino&#8208;dA pyridazine conjugates connected by a short rigid cyclopropenyl ring led to reduced thermal stability, whereas pyridazine conjugates attached by a long flexible linker retained duplex stability. The findings of this investigation pave the way for functionalization and labelling in the minor groove of DNA using copper free iEDDA cycloaddition.

         <title>MXene Loaded With Cu(2&#8208;x)Se Nanozyme for Nanocatalytic Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 25, May 5, 2025. </description>

The study innovatively combines etched/stripped monolayer Ti3C2 MXene with Cu(2&#8208;x)Se nanoparticles in a one&#8208;pot method. The synthesized Ti3C2/Cu(2&#8208;x)Se nanocomposite has catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD) &#8208;like activities combined with the excellent photothermal properties of MXene, which enhances the catalytic performance of Cu(2&#8208;x)Se under near infrared (NIR) irradiation, and realizes the synergic photothermal catalytic treatment.








Abstract
Traditional tumor treatments (surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, etc.) have certain limitations and can have serious negative effects, such as difficulty in cutting out tumors, damage to normal tissues, and complications. Ordinary nanozymes have low catalytic activity and require higher doses for treatment, which can increase in vivo toxicity and side effects. To address these limitations, we developed a Ti3C2 MXene&#8208;based nanocomposite (Ti3C2/Cu(2&#8208;x)Se) integrating Cu(2&#8208;x)Se nanozymes with dual enzyme&#8208;mimicking activities (catalase and peroxidase) and MXene's photothermal properties. The Cu(2&#8208;x)Se component catalyzes the decomposition of tumor&#8208;overexpressed H2O2 into O2 and cytotoxic &#183;OH, alleviating hypoxia while inducing oxidative stress. Simultaneously, MXene's high surface area and photothermal capability enhance nanozyme stability, biocompatibility, and catalytic efficiency under near&#8208;infrared irradiation. Notably, the photothermal effect amplifies enzymatic activity, enabling synergistic nanocatalytic&#8208;photothermal therapy. This synergy not only degrades glutathione to suppress tumor antioxidant defenses but also achieves targeted tumor ablation with reduced dosage requirements. Our work highlights a rational design of MXene&#8208;based nanozymes for enhanced multimodal tumor therapy, offering a paradigm for nanocomposite&#8208;driven disease treatment.

This work investigates carbon&#8208;based tetrel bond catalysis via density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML). The bowl&#8208;like &#963;&#8208;hole in 1,1&#8208;dicyano&#8208;3,3&#8208;dicarbonylcyclopropane (DCDC) unit acts as the primary catalytic active site in catalyzing Micheal addition reaction, surpassing 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetracyanocyclopropane (TCCP) unit in cyclopropane derivatives.

Abstract
The non&#8208;covalent interaction catalysis has been widely developed and applied in organocatalysis for its green and economical characteristics. In recent years, the carbon&#8208;based tetrel bonds have been successfully applied in organocatalysis. In this work, the structure&#8208;property relationship of carbon&#8208;based tetrel bond catalysts is established by utilizing density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML). Taking the Michael addition reaction as an example, the reaction mechanism and new insight into the catalytic active site are introduced based on the DFT&#8208;calculated results. The bowl&#8208;like 1,1&#8208;dicyano&#8208;3,3&#8208;dicarbonylcyclopropane (DCDC) unit based &#963;&#8208;hole is much more important than the 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetracyanocyclopropane (TCCP) unit in tetrel bond catalysts. Introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups into catalysts significantly enhances the catalytic activity and provides a new strategy for designing efficient catalysts. Furthermore, the construction and evaluation of ML models demonstrate their potential in predicting the catalyst performance, offering a new protocol for fast prediction of the catalytic performance of tetrel bond catalysts.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The non-covalent interaction catalysis has been widely developed and applied in organocatalysis for its green and economical characteristics. In recent years, the carbon-based tetrel bonds have been successfully applied in organocatalysis. In this work, the structure-property relationship of carbon-based tetrel bond catalysts is established by utilizing density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML). Taking the Michael addition reaction as an example, the reaction mechanism and new insight into the catalytic active site are introduced based on the DFT-calculated results. The bowl-like 1,1-dicyano-3,3-dicarbonylcyclopropane (DCDC) unit based &#963;-hole is much more important than the 1,1,2,2-tetracyanocyclopropane (TCCP) unit in tetrel bond catalysts. Introducing electron-withdrawing groups into catalysts significantly enhances the catalytic activity and provides a new strategy for designing efficient catalysts. Furthermore, the construction and evaluation of ML models demonstrate their potential in predicting the catalyst performance, offering a new protocol for fast prediction of the catalytic performance of tetrel bond catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergistic Strong and Reactive Metal&#8208;Support Interactions&#8208;Induced Electronic Regulation of Sub&#8208;2 nm Ru Nanoclusters for Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution Performance</title>

The synergism of strong and reactive metal&#8208;support interaction enhances the hydrogen evolution performance of Ru nanoclusters anchored on N&#8208;doped carbon nanosheet.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;support interaction represents an effective strategy to boost the electrocatalytic performance of electrocatalysts. Herein, a novel electrocatalyst consisting of Ru nanoclusters anchored on the N&#8208;doped carbon nanosheets (abbreviated as Ru@N&#8208;CNS hereafter) with synergistic strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) and reactive metal&#8208;support interaction (RMSI) is developed. Thanks to the equilibrium of SMSI and RMSI, the obtained Ru@N&#8208;CNS electrocatalyst possesses abundant exposed active sites, robust mechanical strength, fast mass transfer, and regulated electronic states, thereby holding outstanding electrochemical hydrogen evolution performance in alkaline medium. To be specific, the Ru@N&#8208;CNS only requires a small overpotential of 16&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, low Tafel slope of 67.8&#160;mV dec&#8722;1, and highlighted long&#8208;term stability, surpassing the commercial Pt/C and Ru/C. More memorably, a water&#8208;splitting electrolyzer built by the Ru@N&#8208;CNS electrode as cathode and commercial RuO2 as anode needs a low cell voltage of 1.56&#160;V at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and exhibits excellent stability, reflecting a huge prospect for scalable electrochemical H2 generation. This work opens up a novel thought of synergizing metal&#8208;support interactions for designing progressive electrocatalysts in energy&#8208;related fields.

The AgNO&#8323; and FeCl&#8323; relay&#8208;catalyzed halochalcogenation and cyclization reaction of terminal aryl alkynols provides a step&#8208;efficient regio&#8208; and chemoselective synthetic approach to produce halogenated selenonaphthalene derivatives in good yields.








Abstract
Herein, we report an AgNO3 and FeCl3 relay&#8208;catalyzed halogenation and electrophilic selenium cyclization reaction. This reaction is based on the trifunctionalization of terminal alkynols using NBS and diorganyl diselenides, providing a step&#8208;efficient synthetic approach to produce halogenated selenonaphthalene derivatives in good yields. Furthermore, the halochalcogenation and cyclization reaction offers an efficient protocol for constructing molecules with two independent reactive centers.

Branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGT's) are membrane&#8208;spanning lipids produced by Acidobacteria, and used extensively in geochemistry as proxies. The first total synthesis of brGDGT Ia has been achieved, elucidating the relative stereochemical configuration of the methyl branches in the chain as syn.








Abstract
Glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) are a group of membrane spanning lipids produced by both Archaea and Bacteria. Branched GDGTs (brGDGTs) are a class of these tetraether lipids known to be produced by certain bacteria and are commonly found in terrestrial environments. Due to their environmental ubiquity, high preservation potential, and role in membrane adaptation, brGDGTs form the basis of many widely employed paleoenvironmental proxies. The tetramethylated brGDGT Ia is the most commonly reported branched tetraether in cultured Acidobacteria and is a key component of brGDGT&#8208;based temperature indices. Herein, we report the first total synthesis of brGDGT Ia, thereby elucidating the relative configuration of the methyl branches as syn. We further demonstrate that VCD spectroscopy is a suitable tool to determine the absolute configuration of these cryptochiral compounds, a method waiting to be applied to the natural lipid, but currently hampered by its limited availability.

         <title>Robust Self&#8208;Healing Metallo&#8208;Supergels of Folic Acid: Potential Sustainable Gelator for Oilfield Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 25, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In combination with a large group of various metal salts folic acid (FA) forms mechanically robust metallogels with rapid recovery and self&#8208;healing properties. These versatile gel systems provide tunable stiffness, with up to 95% of stiffness restored within 1 min. Our work sheds light on FA as a high potential and universal gelator that is a relatively cheap and sustainable building block for soft materials with practical applications.








Abstract
The majority of known metallosupramolecular gels are based on carefully designed ligands using extensive chemical synthesis. Their gelation is often limited to a certain specific metal salt. We demonstrate that in the presence of a wide group of metal salts natural and readily available folic acid (FA) can act as a supergelator. We report a systematic investigation of 17 mechanically robust FA&#8208;based metallogels at extremely low concentrations (&lt;0.2 wt%). Using oscillatory rheological measurements, we further show that these metallogels undergo rapid recovery and self&#8208;healing, recovering up to 95% of their original stiffness within 1 min. Among the metallogels studied, FA&#8208;chromium(III) acetate gel (0.4 wt%) displayed the highest stiffness with a storage modulus of 4&#160;kPa. More importantly, the stiffness, recovery, and sol&#160;&#8596; gel transitions can be readily tuned by changing either the metal salt or the concentration. Using a combination of various analytical methods, we also suggest a structure of self&#8208;assembly in the metallogel network. This study defines non&#8208;toxic FA as a robust and sustainable building block for metallogels&#8212;mechanically tunable, multi&#8208;responsive soft materials. Finally, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment, we demonstrate that the FA&#8208;chromium(III) acetate gel can be considered as a potent sustainable gellator for enhanced oil recovery applications.

         <title>Synthesis and Evaluation of the Photochemical Properties of Heterocyclic Hemiindigos</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 25, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis enabled the synthesis of a series of 16 novel heterocyclic hemiindigos. From this series, four compounds proved to be very interesting green and red&#8208;light&#8208;responsive hemiindigo photoswitches. The influence of heterocyclic moiety of these compounds on the absorption profiles, stability of isomers, and photoswitching properties are discussed and compared with a theoretical study.








Abstract
This study reports a series of novel heterocyclic hemiindigos (Het&#8208;HI) synthesized via the condensation of indoxyl acetate with various heteroaromatic aldehydes. The influence of electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor heterocycles on the photochemical and photophysical properties of these compounds has been investigated. Our findings reveal that several Het&#8208;HIs exhibit noteworthy photoswitching behavior, including enhanced absorption at the visible region. Notably, certain derivatives respond efficiently to green and red light, achieving good conversions to the metastable E&#8208;isomer and displaying prolonged half&#8208;lives of up to 53 days in a polar solvent. The results highlight the potential of these photoswitches for applications in molecular devices and responsive materials.

&lt;p&gt;A microwave-assisted synthesis enabled the synthesis of a series of 16 novel heterocyclic hemiindigos. From this series, four compounds proved to be very interesting green and red-light-responsive hemiindigo photoswitches. The influence of heterocyclic moiety of these compounds on the absorption profiles, stability of isomers, and photoswitching properties are discussed and compared with a theoretical study.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study reports a series of novel heterocyclic hemiindigos (Het-HI) synthesized via the condensation of indoxyl acetate with various heteroaromatic aldehydes. The influence of electron-rich and electron-poor heterocycles on the photochemical and photophysical properties of these compounds has been investigated. Our findings reveal that several Het-HIs exhibit noteworthy photoswitching behavior, including enhanced absorption at the visible region. Notably, certain derivatives respond efficiently to green and red light, achieving good conversions to the metastable &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;-isomer and displaying prolonged half-lives of up to 53 days in a polar solvent. The results highlight the potential of these photoswitches for applications in molecular devices and responsive materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Phosphinidene Manganese Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 25, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;phosphinidene (NHCP) manganese complex [(NHC)PMn(CO)4] undergoes CO substitution reactions via an associative mechanism akin to the nitrosyl complex [Mn(NO)(CO)4], with the (NHC)P ligand, switching between three&#8208;electron and one&#8208;electron donor modes. Phosphinidene transfer and chalcogenation reactions along the Mn&#8211;P double bond afford metalladiphosphiranes and metallaphosphachalcogeniranes with three&#8208;membered MnPE rings.








Abstract
The reaction of manganese pentacarbonyl bromide with the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;phosphinidene adduct (IDipp)PSiMe3 afforded the tetracarbonyl complex [(IDipp)PMn(CO)4] (1) with the release of Me3SiBr and CO (IDipp = 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene). X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis revealed a trigonal&#8208;bipyramidal coordination geometry with a short Mn&#9472;P bond, indicative of double bond character. CO substitution with phosphines, NHCs, and isocyanides yielded complexes [(IDipp)PMnL(CO)3] (2&#8211;5) in which the ligands (L) occupy axial positions. Kinetic studies and DFT calculations support an associative substitution mechanism, analogous to the nitrosyl complex [Mn(NO)(CO)4], demonstrating the ability of (NHC)P and NO ligands to modulate their electronic properties as either one&#8208; or three&#8208;electron donors. Complex 1 also underwent phosphinidene transfer and chalcogenation reactions along the manganese&#8208;phosphorus bond, resulting in metalladiphosphiranes (6, 7) and metallaphospha&#8208;chalcogeniranes (8, 9) with three&#8208;membered MnPP and MnPE (E = Se, Te) rings.

         <title>Hydrogen Bonding&#8211;Induced Multicolor and Thermochromic Emissions of Triphenylamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 25, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two triphenylamine derivatives exhibited distinct fluorescence behaviors under stimuli such as mechanical grinding, heat, and solvents. The intramolecular hydrogen bonds, as well as hydrogen bonds with solvents, were responsible for their stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescence properties. Regulating the rigidity through hydrogen bonding offers a feasible strategy for designing stimuli&#8208;responsive materials.








Abstract
The fluorescence tuning of stimuli&#8208;responsive materials is crucial but challenging. The deep understanding of thermal induced fluorescence change, however, has rarely been conducted. Herein, the thermochromic emission of a triphenylamine (TPA) derivative (1), with one acetyl and two 1&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;methylethyl units on each o&#8208;phenyl group around the nitrogen atom, has been investigated. Upon heating, the bright blue&#8208;emitting solid 1 turns to a strong green&#8208;emitting liquid. Moreover, 1 is green emissive in ethanol but blue emissive with high absolute quantum yields in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Another TPA derivative (2) is green emitting. X&#8208;ray crystallography studies reveal that the strong solid&#8208;state fluorescence arises from a rigid pyramidal structure around central nitrogen of 1, due to the OH&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;OH, OH&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;O&#160;=&#160;C hydrogen bonding interactions. Comparatively, 2 has a planar configuration of three C&#9472;N bonds around central nitrogen atom. This work will provide a new route for constructing multiemission materials using unimolecular platforms.

         <title>1,3&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;Zwitterionic Complexes of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes in Reactions with Arylallenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of 2&#8208;arylcyclopropane&#8208;1,1&#8208;dicarboxylates (ACDC) with GaCl3 and other Lewis acids in the presence of 3&#8208;arylbuta&#8208;1,2&#8208;dienes, which acts as a trapping agent for the 1,2&#8208; or 1,3&#8208;zwitterionic intermediates being generated, has been studied. The reaction of 1,2&#8208;zwitterionic gallium complexes at low temperature has been found to give products of annulation at the phenyl substituent in the allene, 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;(inden&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethylmalonates, as the main products. Only in the case of naphthylcyclopropanedicarboxylate, the formation of a polycyclic frame by annulation at both aromatic moieties occurred upon an increase in temperature to 0&#176;C. Trapping of 1,3&#8208;zwitterions, the primary intermediates of cyclopropane ring opening, by the indicated allene was most successful if catalytic amounts of GaCl3 were added directly to the reaction mixture. In this case, the reaction followed the pathway of the usual formal (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition of 1,3&#8208;zwitterions at each of the double bonds of the allene to give the corresponding exo&#8208;methylenecyclopentane&#8208;1,1&#8208;dicarboxylates in up to 93% yields. This process occurred with the highest efficiency at the unsubstituted double bond of 3&#8208;arylbuta&#8208;1,2&#8208;diene.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Generation by Cyclization of an Organic Structure Directing Agent for the Synthesis of High Silica Zeolite ERS&#8208;7</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic route is established to high silica zeolite ERS&#8208;7 templated by a dimethylpyrrolidinium organic structure directing agent (OSDA) in the presence of a cationic polymer, both formed in situ from organic precursors. The polymer enables the cyclization that gives the OSDA and inhibits the crystallization of the competing zeolite mordenite.








Abstract
Zeolites with high framework Si/Al ratios are of interest for industrial applications due to their hydrothermal stability. They are usually synthesized in the presence of pre&#8208;prepared organic structure directing agents (OSDAs). The high silica ERS&#8208;7 zeolite (topology type ESV) can be crystallized using N,N&#8208;dimethylpyrrolidinium (dmpyrr) that is formed in situ via cyclization of N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;diaminobutane (tmdab) when a cationic polymer is also present. The in situ generation of dmpyrr is demonstrated by solid&#8208;state 13C NMR spectroscopy and supported by both chemical analyses and comparative syntheses using pre&#8208;prepared dmpyrr. The cationic polymer inhibits the crystallization of mordenite, which is otherwise observed to be the favored product. The ERS&#8208;7 prepared via in situ dmpyrr synthesis (Si/Al = 14) is characterized by PXRD and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. The CO2 adsorption seen for the H&#8208; and Na&#8208;forms indicates interactions with accessible Na+ cations. The synthetic studies indicate the potential for in situ generation of OSDAs to reduce the need for extended OSDA syntheses.

         <title>Copper (II) Triflate/ Vitamin&#8208;C Promoted Modified Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman Annulation: A Facile Route to Fluorescent Cyclopentene Derivatives</title>

         <dc:description>
Herein, a copper triflate (Cu(OTf)2) promoted Intramolecular Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman(IMBH) annulation protocol is reported for the synthesis of fused cyclopentenoids which in turn act as molecular sensors for hazardous amine detection. A characteristic interconversion via 1,5&#8208;H shift between two non&#8208;separable isomeric mixtures of cyclopentene derivatives, and a solvent&#8208;free organic acid mediated version of the protocol, provide exciting dimensions to this work.








Abstract
Herein we report a rapid and efficient method for the synthesis of fused cyclopentenoids via Intramolecular Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman (IMBH) annulation. In this approach, copper triflate (Cu(OTf)2) serves as the promoter, favoring cyclization and aromatization over the conventional MBH addition product. A characteristic feature among most of the cyclized product contain two non&#8208;separable isomeric mixture of cyclopentene derivatives which has been readily interconverted via 1,5&#8208;H shift. This sigmatropic shift has been proved via deuterium labelling experiment using the first synthesized 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;6&#8208;methoxy&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydronaphthalene&#8208;2&#8208;carbaldehyde&#8208;d. The equilibration of two cyclopentadiene ring via sigmatropic shift has also been characterized by 2D NMR experiment. The scale&#8208;up experiment in the modified IMBH reaction also flourish our protocol significantly. Additionally, the same compounds have also been synthesized in solvent&#8208;free conditions using organic acids, which reduces the use of hazardous substances, providing an alternate pathway for the IMBH reaction avoiding conventional aqueous work&#8208;up. Moreover, this novel IMBH reaction has been thoroughly investigated and elucidated using Density Functional Theory (DFT). The construction of such fluorescent derivatives and the evaluation of their unique photophysical properties revealed acid&#8208;base interactions with active methylene groups, facilitating their use as sensors of hazardous amine derivatives via fluorescence quenching mechanism.

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Based Design of Metallocene Catalysts for Controlled Olefin Copolymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To design catalysts for ethylene/hexene copolymerization, a virtual screening scheme combining predictive models with a genetic algorithm was proposed. Chemically intuitive descriptors obtained from mechanism analysis improve the generalizability of models, effectively predicting catalysts with new core structures not included in the fitting set. This scheme is used to design new zirconocene catalysts with desired properties and diverse core structures.








Abstract
Polyolefins are versatile materials for various purposes, but their functionality should be fine&#8208;tuned for target applications including the mitigation of adverse environmental impacts. Producing such polymers with desired properties requires catalysts that can control polymerization at an atomistic level. However, complex reaction mechanisms and very limited experimental data make it difficult to design new efficient catalysts using conventional computational and data&#8208;driven approaches. Here, we present a pragmatic strategy based on data&#8208;efficient predictive models combined with a genetic algorithm to design new catalysts for controlled ethylene/hexene copolymerization. By deriving the chemically intuitive descriptors from the mechanistic analysis of the polymerization, we achieved the promising predictive models with small data applicable to various core structures and different experimental conditions, respectively. We screened catalysts through a virtual screening scheme combining a genetic algorithm and predictive models using chemically intuitive descriptors and considered their synthesizability through the manual inspections of experts. As a result, we successfully designed nine catalysts with desired comonomer ratios and diverse core structures.

         <title>The Dugganite Structure as a Host for New Colored Compounds and for Oxygen Evolution Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A family compounds with the general formula A3BC3D2O14 (A = Pb, Ba, Sr; B = Te, Sb; C = Al, Ga, Fe, Zn; D = P, V, As, Si, Ge) stabilised in the dugganite structure has been prepared and characterized. The transition metal ions substituted at the tetrahedral sites in place of Zn2+ ions, gave rise to brightly colored compounds. The origin of colors in the compounds were understood based on the allowed d&#8208;d transitions and possible metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (MMCT) transitions involving the different transition elements. The white compounds exhibited good near infrared ( NIR) reflectivity as well as deep UV &#8208; cut off (85&#8208;90%), which indicates possible use as UV&#8208;NLO materials. The compounds exhibited reasonable second harmonic generation (SHG) activity with values that are 3&#8211; 5 times higher than KDP. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) studies on Pb3TeCo3V2O14 and Pb3Te(Co2Fe)(VSi)O14, exhibited good OER behavior in alkaline medium with long &#8211; term stability. The change in the band gap values for the transition metal substituted compounds were understood through density functional theory calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Microwave&#8208;Assisted N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide Nanogel Synthesis: Exploring the Role of Reaction Parameters and Crosslinking Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study provides a detailed account of the use of microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis as a novel and efficient method for preparing monodisperse poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) nanogels. The synthesis, based on free radical precipitation copolymerization of NIPAM and crosslinkers in water, was accelerated by microwave irradiation. Crosslinkers such as ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) and degradable bis&#8208;acryloylcystamine (BAC) were employed to study their effects on nanogel structure and properties, including their temperature&#8208;responsive behavior. HPLC analysis revealed differences in monomer and crosslinker conversion between the two agents. The growth of the nanogel particles was analyzed at various polymerization times using dynamic light scattering (DLS), &#950;&#8208;potential measurements and cryo&#8208;TEM imaging. The data showed that microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis reduced reaction time from 6 hours to minutes. BAC produced uniformly crosslinked nanogels, while EGDMA formed nanogels with dense cores and loose PNIPAM shells. Stability studies during storage and in biologically relevant media indicated their potential for biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Boost of Chiroptical Responses through the Enhancement of Electron Transition Dipole Moment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of robust chiroptical systems is crucial for advancing optoelectronic technologies. Spirobifluorenes (SBFs) have proven to be versatile scaffolds for the construction of a wide variety of robust axially chiral compounds presenting strong chiroptical responses. Herein, we present a strategy for boosting the chiroptical responses via enhancing electric transition dipole moment (ETDM) of interacting chromophores in C2&#8208;symmetric SBFs presenting exciton coupling. To experimentally validate this approach, we peripherally extended the SBF scaffold through Knoevenagel condensation with the aim of increasing the ETDM of the featured chromophores. The influence of the functionalization on the ETDM was investigated using a combination of computational modeling and experimental techniques, enabling a detailed examination of the relationship between molecular structure and chiroptical properties. Our results demonstrate that peripheral functionalization of SBFs significantly enhances the electric transition dipole moment (ETDM) of the constituent chromophores, with each incremental increase in ETDM resulting in a five&#8208;fold enhancement of the g&#8208;factor, thereby substantially amplifying the overall chiroptical activity. This straightforward strategy underscores the importance of the ETDM of interacting chromophores in fine&#8208;tuning the optoelectronic properties and provides a promising avenue for the rational design of high&#8208;performance chiroptical materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanded Structural Design of Organic Ionic Plastic Crystals Based on&#160;Linear Tris&#8208;Pyrrolidinium Salt</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic ionic plastic crystal (OIPC) materials exhibit soft solid phases within a specific temperature range, making them promising candidates for various electrochemical devices due to their intrinsic ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability. In this study, a series of linear tris&#8208;pyrrolidinium salts with different alkyl side chain lengths and counter&#8208;anions were synthesized and systematically characterized in terms of their structural, thermal, and electrochemical properties. Among the synthesized compounds, N,N&#8208;bis(4&#8208;(N&#8217;&#8208;undecylpyrrolidinium)butyl)pyrrolidinium tris&#8208;hexafluorophosphate (11&#8208;PF6) exhibited two solid&#8208;solid phase transitions, and a low fusion entropy (&#916;Sf) of 13 J&#8729;K&#8208;1&#8729;mol&#8208;1 at 210 &#176;C. Similarly, N,N&#8208;bis(4&#8208;(N&#8217;&#8208;dodecylpyrrolidinium)butyl)pyrrolidinium tris&#8208;hexafluorophosphate (12&#8208;PF6) showed multiple phase transitions with a low &#916;Sfof 18 J&#8729;K&#8208;1&#8729;mol&#8208;1 at 206 &#176;C. The temperature&#8208;dependent soft crystalline phases of 11&#8208;PF6 were identified as plastic crystal phase using polarized optical microscopy and 1D wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (WAXS). The ionic conductivity of 11&#8208;PF6 was measured to be 2.04&#215;10&#8208;6 S&#8729;cm&#8208;1 at 70 &#176;C. Upon blending with 80 mol% LiTf2N, the ionic conductivity significantly increased to 1.16&#215;10&#8208;4 S&#8729;cm&#8208;1. Electrochemical stability was evaluated via linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). The composite solid electrolyte consisting of 11&#8208;PF6 and 80 mol% LiTf2N exhibited electrochemical stability up to 5.4 V (vs. Li/Li+), highlighting its potential as a high&#8208;voltage electrolyte component.</dc:description>

         <title>Constant pH Molecular Dynamics Simulation of pH Effects on Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Structure, Dynamics and Metal&#8208;Binding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the first molecular dynamics simulations to examine the effect of pH on the structure, dynamics and metal&#8208;binding ability of amyloid&#8208;&#946;, the peptide implicated in onset of Alzheimer's disease. We show that in the pH range of 6 to 8 only histidine residues show variable protonation, that predicted pKa values are in agreement with experimental data, and that changes in pH affect size, flexibility and secondary structure of the peptide. Binding of Cu(II) or Zn(II) to the peptide induces a shift of 1 to 1.5 pKa units in unbound histidine residues, while metal binding modes associated with higher pH induce significant changes in peptide structure. We speculate on the significance of these findings on results showing pH dependence as well as on Cu(II) and Zn(II) modulation of aggregation of Amyloid&#8208;&#946;.</dc:description>

         <title>Template&#8208;Directed Synthesis and Isolation of Unimolecular Oligo[n]catenanes Using a One&#8208;Pot CuAAC &#8220;Click&#8221; Reaction Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Within the field of mechanically interlocked molecules, catenanes have garnered much interest in the past few decades due to their chain&#8208;like architecture of interlocked molecular rings. This interest stems from their unique properties and degrees of freedom that distinguish them from traditional molecular architectures; making catenanes attractive building blocks in the construction of next&#8208;generation polymeric materials. Most approaches to make unimolecular [n]catenanes are either low yielding or rely on multi&#8208;step pathways for preparation and purification. Therefore, developing efficient syntheses for [n]catenanes remains an important challenge for chemists. Here, we describe a template&#8208;directed one&#8208;pot approach that overcomes the limitations of multistep syntheses by using simple, symmetrical phenanthroline&#8208;based precursors and CuAAC &#8216;click&#8217; chemistry to yield a series of unimolecular [n]catenanes. This methodology relies on simultaneous copper(I)&#8208;mediated templation and click chemistry, ultimately producing either a [2]catenane in high yield (82%) or a batch of well&#8208;defined linear [2]&#8208;[5]catenanes (and trace amounts of a [6]catenane) in an 18% overall yield, depending on the rate of addition of the azide&#8208; and alkyne&#8208;functionalized precursors (slow versus rapid addition). Such kinetic control represents a potential pathway towards the preparation of higher order [n]catenanes capable of further chain extension using very simple precursors.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A dextran templated biomimetic synthetic approach was applied for the preparation of CdSe:Eu QDs. The present work examines synthetic variables including the effect of increasing Europium concentration during QDs&#8217; synthesis and the use of different coating agents (citrate versus APTES) to improve the QDs' colloidal stability and ameliorate their cytotoxic behaviour. All samples were subjected to structural and morphological characterizations via Fourier Transform infrared (FT&#8208;IR) spectroscopy, UV&#8211;Visible (UV&#8208;Vis) spectrophotometry, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS). Subsequently, biological evaluation of all the synthesized samples of bare and APTES coated CdSe:Eu QDs was conducted on epithelial HaCaT and breast cancer MCF&#8208;7. The effect of the samples on cellular proliferation and migration was assessed through the wound healing assay. Finally, cellular localization of QDs was examined by fluorescence microscopy by exploiting their inherent fluorescent capability after excitation, thus validating their potential for cellular imaging and theragnostic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrated ammonia capture and exchange on ion&#8208;exchanged 4A zeolites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ammonia poses a challenge in effluent gas streams due to its corrosive nature. In fusion settings tritiated ammonia can be formed, leading to both tritium loss in inventory and the generation of a reactive species. Identifying pathways in which both tritium can be recovered, and the ammonia can be easily handled would be beneficial. One such way to do so would be to combine two useful techniques: ammonia sequestration and hydrogen exchange (ND3&#8594;NH3). However, materials that can both adsorb ammonia and subsequently perform reactions on ammonia have not been well explored. In this work we present the development of ion&#8208;exchanged A&#8208;type zeolites to be utilized as a support material for platinum catalysts. Thus, the zeolite can adsorb ammonia and the platinum catalyst can facilitate hydrogen exchange allowing for bifunctional reactivity of the material to be achieved. A variety of elements were explored for their effect on A&#8208;type zeolites and resulted in an isotopic difference in the adsorption of ND3 and NH3, noting the use of deuterium as a surrogate for tritium. Several platinum&#8208;impregnated zeolites were able to remove ND3 from the gas stream, indicating that utilizing these materials in isotope recovery processes would improve accountability of these valuable hydrogen isotopes.</dc:description>

         <title>From C&#9472;H Bond Insertion to Hydrogen Atom Transfer: Tuning the Reaction Mechanisms of Methane Activation by the Oxidation of Ta2+</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a combined experimental and theoretical study, it is observed that the continued oxidation from Ta2+ to Ta2Ox+ (with x&#160;=&#160;1 &#8211; 6) changes the reactivity with methane from a typical metallic to a typical oxidic behavior. While the bridging motifs in Ta2O2+ enable the dehydrogenation of CH4, the spin density on oxygen atoms in Ta2O5+ facilitates a HAT reaction.








Abstract
The activation of methane under mild conditions is a challenging but rewarding goal; the underlying key parameters, however, remain elusive. In this study on isolated tantalum Ta2+ compounds exposed to methane in a ring&#8208;electrode ion trap, strong changes in the reactivity are observed depending on the compound's degree of oxidation. While the general reaction behavior is presented for species ranging from Ta2+ to Ta2O6+ based on experimental kinetic studies, we focus in more detail on the dehydrogenation reactions occurring on Ta2O2+ and the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) on Ta2O5+, for which density functional theory calculations were performed. In the first part, we elucidate the role of Ta&#8211;C&#8211;Ta bridging motifs in product structures as driving forces for the dehydrogenation of methane on Ta2O2+; in the second part, we investigate the origins of the HAT &#8211; a hitherto unknown reaction scheme for binary tantalum oxides. For the latter, we show that the reactivity originates from the spin density on oxygen atoms, which is a typical characteristic of the reaction on other metal oxides. This reflects a change in the reactivity from oxidized metallic systems to metal oxides and demonstrates that chemical modifications of tantalum compounds can achieve different methane activation schemes.

         <title>Combination of Arsines and Tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane Toward Frustrated Lewis Pair</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study systematically investigates the reactivity of arsine&#8211;borane Lewis pairs, which had not been explored previously. Using tertiary arsines with different steric and electronic properties, the formation of classical Lewis adducts, FLP&#8208;type encounter complexes, and arsonium borate adducts with B(C6F5)3 was demonstrated. Their reactivity toward small molecules and detailed structural characterization were also reported.








Abstract
Various combinations of Lewis acids and bases, particularly frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs), have been investigated for their distinctive reactivities. Nevertheless, to date, no systematic study of arsine&#8211;borane Lewis pairs has been reported. In this study, tertiary arsines with different degrees of steric hindrance and electron&#8208;donating abilities were used. Depending on their steric and electronic properties, arsines form classical Lewis adducts, FLPs, or arsonium borate adducts with tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (B(C6F5)3). Experimental and computational analyzes revealed that trimesitylarsine and B(C6F5)3 form an encounter complex in solution, which is referred to as an FLP adduct. Furthermore, the arsine&#8211;borane pairs react with phenylacetylene and diphenyl disulfide to afford the corresponding arsonium borate adduct and thioarsonium thioborate salt, respectively. The structures of the products were characterized using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Oxidative Thiolated Aromatization of Terpenes for Divergent Construction of Organosulfur Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A convergent and divergent strategy has been developed for the construction of sulfur&#8208;containing terpenoid derivatives using various terpenes with different oxidation states. It is expected that this protocol may be of broad interest in chemistry community pursuing the transformation of terpenes and constitutes a practical alternative to the synthesis of natural products and pharmaceuticals.








Abstract
Synthetic transformation of terpenoids represents a long&#8208;standing research topic in organic synthesis. Due to the presence of multiple oxidation states and isomers in naturally abundant terpenoids, their separation and efficient utilization pose challenges. Convergent transformations of various terpenes can circumvent these issues. We herein developed a convergent and divergent strategy for control of oxidation states, enabling the construction of sulfur&#8208;containing terpenoid derivatives using various terpenes. This protocol features broad substrate scope, good functional compatibility, and high redox&#8208;selectivity. Convergent synthesis strategy was implemented smoothly by using drug and plant extracts. The synthesis of sulfoxide and sulfone products was further achieved by modulating the oxidation conditions, respectively. Additionally, the products can undergo an array of elaborate transformations, which highlight the potential applications of this strategy.

         <title>QM/MM Unlocks The Catalytic Mechanism of YtfE: The Structural Reorganization of The Active Site Enables Nitrite&#8208;to&#8208;NO Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
QM/MM simulations reveal that the structural reorganization of the active site, particularly the alternation of the hydrogen bonding network and coordination switch of the HONO intermediate, is critical for the reductive cleavage of the N&#9472;O bond and NO formation in the nonheme diiron YtfE. This mechanistic insight advances understanding of nitrite reduction in nonheme diiron oxygenases and their biological roles.








Abstract
Escherichia coli (E. coli) repair of iron center protein (also known as YtfE) is a nonheme diiron protein that plays a pivotal role in bacterial responses to nitrosative stress, particularly in nitrite reduction and nitric oxide metabolism. Although previous studies have explored its potential as a nitrite reductase, the detailed catalytic mechanism, especially the role of its diiron center in nitrite reduction, remains poorly understood. In this study, we employed multiscale computational approaches, including quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM), quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics metadynamics (QM/MM MD), and quantum mechanics (QM) calculations, to elucidate the molecular mechanism of nitrite reduction by YtfE. Our findings reveal that structural reorganization of the active site, particularly the alternation of the hydrogen bonding network and coordination switch of the HONO intermediate, is critical for modulating the nitrite reduction mechanism. This work provides significant insights into the catalytic mechanism of YtfE, offering a theoretical foundation for understanding its role in bacterial stress responses and potential applications in synthetic biology and environmental remediation.

         <title>Realizing the Capacity Benefit of Anionic Redox in Stoichiometric Sodium Manganese Oxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully harnessing the capacity benefit of anionic redox reactions requires Na&#8208;stoichiometric compounds with 3d TMs. The successful synthesis of O3&#8208;NaLi1/3Mn2/3O2 marked the first step, which delivers decent capacity with no voltage decay. We provide strategies such as designing chemical composition, multiphase structure, and ordering superstructure to further improve the energy density with anionic redox without sacrificing kinetics and energy efficiency






.

Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries offer a cost&#8208;effective and sustainable alternative to lithium&#8208;ion batteries, yet their lower energy density remains a challenge. Anionic redox in layered oxide cathodes has the potential to enhance capacity beyond the limits of transition&#8208;metal redox. This potential is maximized in full&#8208;stoichiometric sodium compounds with 3d transition metals, a goal hindered by synthesis challenges. The successful synthesis of O3&#8208;NaLi1/3Mn2/3O2 marked a breakthrough, offering high capacity, moisture stability, and no voltage decay.

&lt;p&gt;Fully harnessing the capacity benefit of anionic redox reactions requires Na-stoichiometric compounds with 3&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; TMs. The successful synthesis of O3-NaLi&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; marked the first step, which delivers decent capacity with no voltage decay. We provide strategies such as designing chemical composition, multiphase structure, and ordering superstructure to further improve the energy density with anionic redox without sacrificing kinetics and energy efficiency

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sodium-ion batteries offer a cost-effective and sustainable alternative to lithium-ion batteries, yet their lower energy density remains a challenge. Anionic redox in layered oxide cathodes has the potential to enhance capacity beyond the limits of transition-metal redox. This potential is maximized in full-stoichiometric sodium compounds with 3&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; transition metals, a goal hindered by synthesis challenges. The successful synthesis of O3-NaLi&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; marked a breakthrough, offering high capacity, moisture stability, and no voltage decay. Yet, issues such as irreversibility, voltage hysteresis, and slow kinetics remain. In this concept, we review the state of the art of this promising O3 phase with a brief account of other anionic-redox-based Na compounds. We then discuss strategies and prospects to address these challenges, including tuning chemical compositions, O/P multiphase structures, and superstructure ordering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Litchi&#8208;Skin&#8208;Like NiMoP2 Microspheres Supported on MOF&#8208;Derived Carbon Layer as High Performance Composite Positive Electrode of Asymmetric Supercapacitor</title>

Supercapacitor Electrode: Litchi&#8208;skin&#8208;like morphology NiMoP2 microspheres loaded on MOF&#8208;derived carbon layers for enhancing the electrochemical performance of ASCs.








Abstract
Developing ideal positive electrodes with excellent performance and structural stability for supercapacitors is crucial in enhancing the application potential. Herein, we successfully fabricate a composite structure of NiMoP2@C on nickel foam (NF) (NMP@C/NF), which is formed by loading a litchi&#8208;skin&#8208;like morphology NiMoP2 microspheres onto MOF&#8208;derived carbon layer with the two&#8208;step electrodeposition method. The carbon layer acts as a structurally stable framework, and its synergistic effect with active materials suppresses volume expansion while enhancing electron transport efficiency. Meanwhile, the heterogeneous interface between crystalline/amorphous phases optimizes redox reaction kinetics, and the unique morphology composed of multi&#8208;scale components increases the accessible surface area for redox reactions. As a result, the NMP@C/NF obtains a high specific capacitance of 2224.8 F g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1, and the capacitance retention rate is 94.97% after 8000 cycles. The asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) assembled with NMP@C/NF positive electrode and active carbon negative electrode generates an energy density of 52.52&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 784.55&#160;W kg&#8722;1, and its capacitance retention rate reaches up to 78% after 8000 cycles. This study provides promising pathway for the rational design of high&#8208;performance and environmentally friendly positive electrodes for supercapacitors.

         <title>Differentiating Ligand Tailoring and Cation Incorporation as Strategies for Tuning Heterobimetallic Cerium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influences of ligand structure and incorporation of secondary Lewis acidic cations on high coordination number cerium centers have been studied, revealing unique roles for ligands and secondary cations in driving structural and electronic tunability. Tuning of redox&#8208;active complexes by secondary cations is an important strategy commonly applied to low coordination number metal centers but one that is underexplored for heavier metals like lanthanides (including cerium) and actinides.








Abstract
Tuning of redox&#8208;active complexes featuring metals with high coordination numbers by incorporation of secondary redox&#8208;inactive cations has received far less attention than it deserves. Here, appending moderate steric bulk to a tripodal ligand framework has been tested for its influence on secondary&#8208;cation&#8208;driven structural and electrochemical tuning of cerium, a lanthanide that tends to adopt high coordination numbers. A quasi&#8208;C3&#8208;symmetric cerium(III) complex denoted [Ce] has been prepared that features pendant benzyloxy groups, and this work demonstrates that this species offers a site capable of binding single Na+ or Ca2+ ions. Electrochemical and UV&#8208;visible spectroscopic studies reveal equilibrium binding affinity of [Ce] for Na+ in acetonitrile solvent, contrasting with tight binding of all cations in all other previously studied systems of this type. The modulated cation binding can be attributed to the bulky benzyloxy groups, which impact the thermodynamics of cation binding but do not impede the formation of cerium centers with coordination number 8 upon binding of either Na+ or Ca2+. The Ce(IV/III) reduction potential was found to be tunable under the equilibrium binding conditions, highlighting the potentially significant role that controlled structural changes can play in modulating the solution properties of heterobimetallic complexes.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of Two Fucosylated Human Milk Oligosaccharides: 3&#8208;Fucosyllactose and Lacto&#8208;N&#8208;fucopentaose V</title>

         <dc:description>
3&#8208;Fucosyllactose human milk oligosaccharide was produced using a reliable chemical synthesis approach. Also reported is the first chemical synthesis of lacto&#8208;N&#8208;fucopentaose V human milk oligosaccharide. The approach for the synthesis of lacto&#8208;N&#8208;fucopentaose V comprised a convergent&#160;2 + 3 assembly strategy, making use of a trisaccharide building block derived from 3&#8208;fucosyllactose.








Abstract
Glycans present in human milk have been the focus of many studies due to challenges associated with their synthesis. The development of new methods for obtaining individual glycans found in human milk has been a vibrant area of research in glycosciences. This study reports the synthesis of two fucosylated glycans found in human milk, 3&#8208;fucosyllactose, which was previously synthesized by both chemical and enzymatic methods, and the first chemical synthesis of lacto&#8208;N&#8208;fucopentaose V. Screening different protecting and leaving groups, as well as optimizing the glycosylation reaction conditions helped us to achieve efficient assembly and deprotection of these two fucosylated human milk oligosaccharides in good yields.

         <title>Click Conjugates of Artificial Ribonucleases: Sequence Specific Cleavage with Multiple Turnover</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A trisbenzimidazole catalyst was attached to central positions of DNA and DNA&#8208;LNA oligonucleotides. The resulting conjugates bind complementary RNA strands and cleave them with multiple turnover and substrate half&#8208;lives down to 3.5&#160;hours. Up to 98.8% of cleavage occurs in a single site. The reaction does not depend on metal ions and also runs in the presence of EDTA.








Abstract
The azido modified RNA cleaving catalyst 2 has been attached to oligonucleotides containing alkyne linkers in a central position. The resulting conjugates hybridize specifically with complementary RNA strands and cleave them with multiple substrate turnover. RNA half&#8208;lives are in the range of 6&#8211;7&#160;hours (pH 8, 37 &#176;C). Some well&#8208;placed locked nucleic acid (LNA) nucleotides can further increase substrate affinities and reaction rates significantly (t&#189; of 3.5&#160;hours, kobs&#160;=&#160;0.20 h&#8722;1). RNA cleavage does not require metal ions and runs equally well in the presence of EDTA. Fragments of precisely defined lengths are formed, well suited for subsequent analysis by mass spectrometry and related bioanalytical techniques.

         <title>N&#8208;Sulfonyl Imidazoliums as the Versatile Coupling Reagents and Sulfonating Reagents in Synthesis of Amides, Esters, Thioesters, Phosphoramides, Phosphoesters, Glycosides, Sulfonamides and Sulfonates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we report a novel strategy for the first time: bench&#8208;stable N&#8208;sulfonyl imidazoliums were used as the robust and versatile coupling reagents and sulfonating reagents. Fast reactions of N&#8208;sulfonyl imidazoliums with carboxylic acids or phosphodiesters formed carboxylic acid&#8208;sulfonic acid mixed anhydrides and phosphosulfonic acid mixed anhydrides, respectively, and the subsequent treatments of the highly active intermediates with the corresponding nucleophilic partners in the presence of imidazoles at room temperature provided amides, dipeptides, carboxylic esters, carboxylic thioesters (almost without racemization during the formation of amides, dipeptides, esters, thioesters), phosphamides and phosphoesters in high to excellent yields. This kind of Nsulfonyl imidazolium as the coupling reagent was successfully applied in solid phase synthesis of a polypeptide containing 32 amino acid residues. This strategy was effectively extended to the construction of glycosides, and high steroselectivity and good yields were provided. In addition, reactions of N&#8208;sulfonyl imidazoliums with amines or alcohols afforded the corresponding sulfonamides and sulfonates in excellent yields. This study should provide a highly efficient, economical and practical strategy for construction of diverse molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Pt&#8208;Decorated NiMo/Carbon Hybrid Catalysts for High&#8208;Current&#8208;Density Hydrogen Evolution: Synergistic Electronic Modulation and Industrial Application Potential</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study focuses on the development of a Pt&#8208;decorated NiMo&#8208;based carbon&#8208;supported catalyst (Pt&#8208;NiMo/C) through a solvent evaporation and high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis method, which shows excellent performance in the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction with low overpotentials, high stability, and great potential for industrial&#8208;scale water electrolysis and energy conversion applications.








Abstract
In response to the urgent demand for sustainable hydrogen production under industrial high&#8208;current&#8208;density conditions, this study presents the development of a Pt&#8208;decorated NiMo&#8208;based carbon&#8208;supported catalyst (Pt&#8208;NiMo/C) for efficient alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The catalyst was synthesized via a solvent evaporation method followed by high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis, achieving uniform dispersion of Pt&#8208;NiMo nanoparticles on conductive carbon. Electrochemical evaluations revealed exceptional HER performance with ultralow overpotentials of 20 and 170&#160;mV versus RHE at current densities of 10 and 100&#160;mA cm&#8315;2, respectively, surpassing commercial Pt/C benchmarks. The Pt&#8208;NiMo catalyst demonstrated robust stability over 120 hours at 100&#160;mA cm&#8315;2, attributed to its hierarchical structure and synergistic electronic interactions between Pt and NiMo. The MEA configuration showcased stable electrochemical performance with a current density of 100&#160;mA cm&#8315;2 at a cell voltage of 1.53&#160;V versus RHE, highlighting its potential for efficient energy conversion applications such as water electrolysis or fuel cells. These results underscore the catalyst's potential for industrial&#8208;scale water electrolysis, offering a cost&#8208;effective and durable solution for green hydrogen production.

         <title>Direct Transformation of Bio&#8208;Based Furfural into &#947;&#8208;Valerolactone over SO3H&#8208;Functionalized P&#9472;O&#9472;Hf Hybrid Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SO3H&#8208;functionalized P&#8208;O&#8208;Hf hybrid catalyst GPCS&#8208;Hf(1:1.5) was constructed to be highly efficient for the direct upgrading of furfural (FF) to &#947;&#8208;valerolactone (GVL) in a high yield of 71%, involving multiple reaction steps, mainly attributed to an appropriate amount/distribution of Lewis acid&#8208;base (Hf4+&#8208;O2&#8722;) and Br&#248;nsted acid (H+) sites and favorable texture structure. Moreover, GPCS&#8208;Hf(1:1.5) was highly recyclable with intact multi&#8208;functional motifs.








Abstract
&#947;&#8208;Valerolactone (GVL) has great application potential in organic synthesis and biofuels, while its high&#8208;efficiency production from easily available bio&#8208;based feedstock is challenging. In this work, SO3H&#8208;functionalized P&#8208;O&#8208;Hf hybrid catalysts GPCS&#8208;Hf(n:m) were facilely prepared by solvothermal treatment of glucose&#8208;containing organic precursors (GPC) and Hf4+ in a mass ratio of n:m. The acid strength and Lewis/Br&#248;nsted acid sites of GPCS&#8208;Hf(n:m) could be modulated by tuning the GPC/Hf4+ ratio. Among them, GPCS&#8208;Hf(1:1.5) with appropriate acid&#8208;base properties delivered prominent catalytic activity in the direct upgrading of a bio&#8208;based bulk chemical furfural (FF) to GVL with a good yield of 71%, as optimized by response surface methodology. Especially, the suitable distribution of Lewis acid (Hf4+), Lewis base (O2&#8722;), and Br&#248;nsted acid (H+) sites played a synergistic role in cascade transfer hydrogenation, furan ring opening, second hydrogenation, and lactonization. Moreover, the GPCS&#8208;Hf(1:1.5) catalyst was unveiled to have a uniform elemental dispersion, relatively large specific surface area, and amorphous structure, which might also contribute to its superior efficiency. Recycling experiments showed that GPCS&#8208;Hf(1:1.5) could be reused at least six&#160;times with almost no decline in activity. The overall bio&#8208;derived catalytic conversion system offers a more sustainable manner for biomass valorization.

         <title>p&#8208;&#960; Conjugate Triggered Red Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence from Single Benzene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing the p&#8208;&#960; conjugation, single benzene derivatives, which are uniquely different from conventional extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems, display red/NIR RTP under ambient condition. One of the phosphors shows maximum RTP peak at 585&#160;nm, along with shoulder peaks at 545&#160;nm, 635&#160;nm, and 700&#160;nm. This architecture minimizes the requirement for red/NIR phosphors to a single benzene ring.








Abstract
Benzene is the simplest and the most basic building block for the construction of &#960; conjugated systems, which are widely used in various fields from fluorescent (FL) dyes to optoelectronic displays. However, achieving the red room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from single benzene is still challenging. Utilizing the p&#8208;&#960; conjugation, herein, we report a single benzene&#8208;based push&#8208;pull system with red RTP under ambient condition. One of the phosphors shows maximum RTP peak at 585&#160;nm, along with shoulder peaks at 545&#160;nm, 635&#160;nm, and 700&#160;nm. This architecture is uniquely separate from conventional extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems and minimizes the requirement for red/near&#8208;infrared (NIR) phosphors to a single benzene ring.

         <title>Photocatalysis Enables Chemodivergent Radical Polar Crossover: Ritter&#8208;Type Amidation vs Heck&#8208;Type Olefin Carbofunctionalizations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One aryl makes the difference: switching styrenes with 1,1&#8208;diaryl olefins as radical acceptors, the benzylic cation intermediate fate changes from Ritter&#8208;type carboamidation to Heck&#8208;type reaction. The decarboxylative photocatalytic chemodivergent methodology enabled broad scope and efficient scalability in both batch and flow. Mechanistic and computational studies demonstrated both radical generation pathways and the origin of product switchability. 








Abstract
Three&#8208;component alkene difunctionalization reactions constitute an ideal platform to rapidly build molecular complexity, enabling the simultaneous introduction of two distinct, orthogonal functional groups into the C&#9552;C bond in a single step. Herein, a photoredox catalyzed Ritter&#8208;type carboamidation of electronically diverse styrenes harnessing non&#8208;stabilized, nucleophilic primary radicals generated from readily&#8208;accessible carboxylic acid&#8208;derived redox active esters is reported. Furthermore, it is found that Heck&#8208;type products are chemoselectively obtained by simply switching aryl olefin acceptors with 1,1&#8208;diarylolefins. In the context of photocatalytic chemodivergent radical polar crossover, the synthesis of various trisubstituted alkenes was achieved, simultaneously revealing a divergence in the activation of redox&#8208;active esters toward reduction. In&#8208;depth mechanistic studies demonstrated both transformation pathways, while DFT calculations indicated the origin of product switchability. Both Ritter&#8208;type and Heck&#8208;type olefin carbofunctionalizations are scalable up to 4&#160;mmol scale in batch and continuous flow, proving the synthetic utility of the methodology.

         <title>Lewis&#8208;X&#8208;Containing Triterpenoid Saponins Inhibit DC&#8208;SIGN&#8208; and L&#8208;SIGN&#8208;Mediated Transfer of HIV&#8208;1 Infection</title>

The convergent synthesis of Lewis&#8208;X&#8208;containing betulinic acid and echinocystic acid saponins (1 and 2) is presented. The synthetic saponins were shown to inhibit, at the low micromolar range, the DC&#8208;SIGN&#8208; and L&#8208;SIGN&#8208;mediated transfer of HIV&#8208;1 infection to CD4&#8208;positive cells, whereas free Lewis&#8208;X, aglycones, and structurally similar triterpenoid saponins lacking the fucose residue were not.








Abstract
Blocking dendritic cell&#8208;specific intercellular adhesion molecule&#8208;3&#8208;grabbing nonintegrin (DC&#8208;SIGN)&#8208; and liver/lymph node&#8208;specific intercellular adhesion molecule&#8208;3&#8208;grabbing integrin (L&#8208;SIGN)&#8208;mediated human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV&#8208;1) attachment to immune cells represents a promising strategy for developing antiretroviral agents effective during the early stages of sexual transmission. Although mannose&#8208; and fucose&#8208;based ligands have received considerable attention, Lewis&#8208;based inhibitors remain relatively underexplored. In this study, we report the first synthesis of Lewis&#8208;X&#8208;containing triterpenoid saponins featuring betulinic acid and echinocystic acid as aglycones. These saponins were stereoselectively and efficiently synthesized in six linear steps using a convergent approach that leveraged thioglycoside and trichloroacetimidate glycosylation chemistries. Notably, our findings demonstrate that these Lewis&#8208;X&#8208;containing triterpenoid saponins are among the most potent monovalent inhibitors reported to date of DC&#8208;SIGN&#8208; and L&#8208;SIGN&#8208;mediated transfer of HIV&#8208;1 infection to CD4&#8208;positive cells, with IC50&#160;values in the low micromolar range (21&#8211;50 &#181;M). This work lays a valuable foundation for the development of saponin&#8208;based antiviral agents targeting immune cells.

         <title>Efficient and Selective Transformations of &#945;&#8208;Keto Esters into &#945;&#8208;Arylated &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Esters Using Continuous&#8208;Flow System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemoselective nucleophilic addition of aryllithium reagents to the keto&#8208;carbonyl moiety in &#945;&#8208;keto esters as ambident carbonyl electrophiles has been achieved by using flash continuous&#8208;flow system that has overcome the problems in the conventional batch reaction system. One or multiple competitive ester moieties remained intact despite the high reactivities of aryllithium reagents including the short&#8208;lived functionalized species that cannot survive in the batch reaction system. 








Abstract
This research explores the selective reactions of organolithium reagents with &#945;&#8208;keto esters using a flow microreactor system. The study highlights the influence of precise temperature control and rapid mixing on enhancing reaction yield and selectivity. By optimizing conditions for aryllithium reagents bearing electrophilic functional groups and &#945;&#8208;keto esters, the system demonstrated superior performance over traditional batch methods. This method efficiently minimized byproduct formation, providing high yields and excellent selectivity for sterically hindered substrates. The flow microreactor thus offers an innovative platform for complex organometallic transformations.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed C&#9472;H Oxidation of Alkanes and Postfunctionalization of Polyolefin Elastomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The functionalization of polyolefin elastomer (POE) was achieved through the activation of C&#9472;H bonds in the polymer backbone using a cobalt catalyst and cumene hydroperoxide as an oxidant. This transformation enabled the introduction of polar functional groups, including alcohol, ketone, and ester moieties, into the POE structure.








Abstract
This study focuses on the postfunctionalization of polyolefin elastomers (POEs) through direct C&#9472;H activation using a novel cobalt&#8208;based catalytic system. The investigation, initiated with the oxidation of cyclohexane, identified the cumene hydroperoxide (CumHPO) as the optimal oxidant and ligands L3, L4, and L7 as effective in chlorinated benzene solvents. Cobalt catalyst (Cat. 1) demonstrated superior activity in the oxidation of octadecane, achieving a 42% yield with a minimal amount of catalyst. The catalytic system was successfully extended to the C&#9472;H oxidation of POE, introducing functional groups in solvents like 1,2&#8208;Cl2C6H4 and 1,2,4&#8208;Cl3C6H3. Our findings propose a simple and green approach for the postfunctionalization of POE, offering versatility and potential for broader applications in the field of polymeric compounds.

         <dc:description>
The Minisci&#8208;type cross&#8208;coupling reaction between C&#9472;(sp3)&#9472;H bonds and nitrogen&#8208;containing aromatics proceeded successfully using a simple protocol based on MW (microwave) irradiation with a persulfate anion. The MW/PS protocol is applicable to a wide variety of dehydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling leading to the formation of alkylated heteroaromatics, in which the site&#8208;selectivity is ensured by a HAT transition state with a sulfate radical. The MW/persulfate protocol was applicable to direct intramolecular cyclization to give five and six&#8208;membered ring fused lutidine derivatives.








Abstract
The Minisci&#8208;type reaction between C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds and nitrogen&#8208;containing aromatics was carried out using a simple protocol based on the persulfate anion (PS) under microwave (MW) irradiation. The MW/PS protocol is applicable to a wide variety of dehydrogenative coupling reactions of N&#8208;heteroaromatics and C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds, leading to the formation of alkylated heteroaromatics. Site&#8208;selectivity is ensured by hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) with the sulfate radical affecting the polar/steric effects in the transition state. The MW/PS protocol was applicable to direct intramolecular cyclization to give five and six&#8208;membered rings fused by pyridine and lutidine, which, in previous methods, it was necessary to use tedious derivatization to imino&#8208;oxyacetic acids as HAT precursors.

         <title>Advances in Mechanochemical Methods for One&#8208;Pot Multistep Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanochemical synthesis has emerged as a powerful and more sustainable alternative to conventional solution&#8208;based methods, offering advantages such as no or only minimal solvent use, reduced reaction times, and simplified operational conditions. The integration of multiple steps into a single reaction vessel further enhances these benefits by eliminating workup and purification steps, reducing waste, and often improving overall efficiency. This review highlights recent advancements in mechanochemical one&#8208;pot multistep reactions in organic synthesis, focusing on protocols with sequential one&#8208;pot operation. Diverse transformations are covered, including heterocycle formation, functional group interconversions, and the synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients, while discussing both the operational and environmental advantages of these methodologies, along with their remaining challenges. Overall, mechanochemical one&#8208;pot synthesis has the potential to streamline transformations and therefore contribute to more sustainable approaches in modern organic synthetic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;free Process for Preparing Metal&#8208;organic Framework Composites based on Carbon&#8208;based Quantum Dots and their Derivatives as Drug Delivery Systems for Andrographolide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Andrographolide (ADG) was conjugated with MIL&#8208;53(Al), ZIF&#8208;8, carbon&#8208;based quantum dots (CBQDs) and doped carbon&#8208;based quantum dots (D&#8208;CBQDs) using high&#8208;pressure (0.3 GPa) contact. This solvent&#8208;free approach is environmentally friendly, energy&#8208;efficient and time&#8208;saving, resulting in ADG&#8208;MOFs&#8208;CBQDs/D&#8208;CBQDs with physical properties comparable to those produced by traditional liquid phase encapsulation. The resulting nanocomposites were characterized using SEM, XRD, TGA, FT&#8208;IR and 1H NMR. The results indicate that ADG was partly encapsulated within the MOF pores, while another portion was bound externally to CBQD/D&#8208;CBQDs, as evidenced by distinct drug signals in each analysis. This green synthesis approach simplifies the conjugation process. It significantly enhances the drug solubility, as indicated by changes in hydrophobicity observed via 1H NMR, surpassing the improvements achieved by ADG encapsulation within MOFs alone. Additionally, in preliminary tests, the materials exhibited significant cytotoxicity against PC3 cells compared to ADG (25.05 &#177; 0.06 &#181;g/mL) after 48 h of exposure.</dc:description>

         <title>Computational Exploration of Stereoelectronic Relationships in Manganese&#8208;Catalysed Hydrogenation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stereoelectronic effects governing Mn&#8208;catalysed hydrogenation reactions have been deconvoluted through the analysis of a series of in silico catalyst modifications using DFT (PBE0&#8208;D3PCM(EtOH)/def2&#8208;TZVP//RI&#8208;BP86PCM(EtOH)/def2&#8208;SVP level of theory). Computations were performed on the Mn&#8208;catalysed reduction of indanone based on a catalyst from the Clarke group, consisting of a tridentate ligand with pyridine, amine and phosphine donors and a ferrocenyl linker in the backbone. Enantioselectivity enhancements were found through two pathways; firstly, with the stabilisation of aromatic substrates by means of an extended &#960;&#8208;system, enhancing &#960;&#8208;stacking non&#8208;covalent interactions; secondly, by the introduction of steric bulk around the active site to destabilise one of the diastereomeric hydride transfer transition states. Electronic effects were differentiated from sterics by modification of the phenyl groups at the phosphine, trans&#8208; to the metal&#8208;hydride bond. While electron&#8208;withdrawing groups increased the thermodynamic driving force, the highest activity is predicted with electron&#8208;donating groups due to the improved basicity of the nitrogen lone pair, required for the initiation of hydrogen activation. Based on these observations, promising routes for synthetic catalyst design may involve donating groups which improve activity, coupled with enantiodiscrimination via steric bulk as a more general strategy than being limited to &#960;&#8208;containing substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereodynamism in chiral polyaromatic phosphepines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the present experimental&#8208;computational study, we demonstrate that the stereodynamism of phosphahelicenoid can be used to afford diastereoisomers of polyaromatics fused with a chiral phosphepine (7&#8208;membered P&#8208;ring). In particular, we highlight a complex interplay between the inversion at the P centre and helicenoid epimerization as well as a competition with a re&#8208;aromatization reaction. The impact of the conformational modifications on the structure and the chiroptical properties including circularly polarized luminescence are also discussed in detail.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymerase Synthesis of Hypermodified DNA Displaying a Combination of Thiol, Hydroxyl, Carboxylate and Imidazole Functional Groups in the Major Groove</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We designed and synthesized a set of six 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside 5&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;triphosphates (dNTPs) bearing functional groups mimicking amino acid side chains in enzyme active sites (OH, SH, COOH and imidazole) attached to position 5 of pyrimidines or position 7 of 7&#8208;deazapurines through different linkers. These modified dNTPs were studied as substrates in enzymatic synthesis of modified and hypermodified DNA using several DNA polymerases. In primer extension (PEX), all modified dNTPs provided DNA containing one, two, three, or (all) four modified nucleotides each bearing a different modification, although the thiol&#8208;modified dNTPs were worse substrates compared to the others. In PCR, we observed exponential amplification for any combination of one, two or three non&#8208;sulfur dNTPs but the thiol&#8208;modified dNTP did not work well in any combinations. Sequencing of the hypermodified DNA confirmed the good fidelity of the incorporation of all the modified nucleotides. This set of modified dNTPs extends the portfolio of building blocks for prospective use in selections of functional nucleic acids.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Heterometallic [LnIII2CoII5] Clusters: Magnetic Properties and Efffcient Conversion of CO2 with Epoxides and Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three heterometallic [LnIII2CoII5] clusters with the formulas [LnIII2CoII5(L1)2(L2)2(L3)2(OAc)4(NO3)2]&#183;4CH3CN (LnIII = Gd (1), Tb (2), and Dy (3); HL1 = (E)&#8208;1&#8208;((2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;methoxybenzylidene)amino)naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ol, HL2 = 1&#8208;aminonaphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ol, and HL3 = trimethylopropane) have been obtained via self&#8208;assembly of mixed ligands strategy. Signi&#64257;cantly, cluster 1 displays a larger magnetocaloric effect (MCE) (&#8722;&#916;Sm = 36.83 J kg&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 at 2.0 K and 7.0 T), while cluster 3 shows slow magnetic relaxation behavior under zero dc field. Moreover, clusters 1&#8208;3 as heterogeneous catalysts can effectively convert CO2 with epoxides and benzylamine to form oxazolidinones under mild conditions. To our knowledge, it is the first reported bifunctional heterometallic heptanuclear clusters which show well magnetic behaviors and can effectively catalyze CO2 with epoxides and amines under mild conditions simultaneously.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Isocoumarins via Light&#8208;Driven Carboxylative Cyclization Reaction of&#160;o&#8208;Ethynyl Aryl Bromides with CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isocoumarins are an important class of bicyclic lactones, which are seen in natural products, drugs, and bioactive compounds, and a variety of synthetic methods of isocoumarins have been developed. However, the&#160;synthesis of&#160;isocoumarins via the catalytic CO2&#160;fixation has been scarcely reported despite the potential incorporation of CO2&#160;into the lactone moiety. Here, we developed the&#160;light&#8208;driven carboxylative cyclization reaction of&#160;o&#8208;ethynyl aryl bromides&#160;with CO2, which&#160;selectively&#160;produced&#160;isocoumarins.&#160;Control experiments revealed that photoirradiation promoted the cyclization process with&#160;high&#160;selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion Exchange Polyelectrolytes with High Branching Ratio and Adjustable Free Volume for Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational design of polyelectrolytes that simultaneously meets the requirements for anion exchange membrane (AEM) and ionomer (AEI), especially the opposite gas permeation demands for anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) with similar chemical structure is challenging. To overcome the formation of insoluble gel at high branching ratio (BR), herein, a series of anion exchange polyelectrolytes of intrinsic microporosity with wide&#8208;ranged fractional free volume and good solubility at high BR are fabricated through a stepwise nonstoichiometric superacid&#8208;catalyzed polycondensation reaction. By precisely controlling the BR and free volume, a stable and porosity&#8208;adjustable structure is generated which not only addresses the conductivity&#8208;toughness trade&#8208;off of AEM, but also possesses high OH&#8208; conductivity for AEI. Most importantly, it fulfills the opposite gas permeation demands for AEM and AEI, and decreases the overpotentials of ohmic polarization and mass transport by 76.2% and 44.2%, respectively. The membrane electrode assembly fabricated by the optimized AEM and AEI achieves 1.98 V (pure water) and 1.62 V (1M KOH) at 1 A cm&#8208;2 with high stability. This work provides a strategy for rational design of polyelectrolytes that meets the requirements of AEM and AEI for high&#8208;performance AEMWE.</dc:description>

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Amination of Peptides on the Solid Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Late&#8208;stage peptide modification is a powerful tool for rapidly generating a library of peptide mimetics e.g. for drug discovery or catalyst development. While late&#8208;stage modifications exist for many types of structural features, methods for introducing amines into peptides via a late&#8208;stage approach are rare, despite their enormous potential for the development of peptide therapeutics. Here we present a protocol for introducing amines into peptides by our established on&#8208;resin iodination&#8208;substitution approach. Our method is compatible with a wide variety of amines, including primary and secondary amines, anilines and other heteroaromatic N&#8208;nucleophiles mostly giving good to excellent yields. We introduce amines that are pharmacologically relevant as well as those that can impart catalytic or metal binding properties into the peptide of interest. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, we introduce the metal ligand tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)amine (tren) into a tryptophan zipper scaffold using our late&#8208;stage amination approach to explore metal&#8208;induced stapling. Indeed, metal complexation via the tren ligand resulted in a thermal stabilization of more than 30 K in one of our tryptophan zipper designs.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in Polyoxometalate&#8210;Metal Nanocluster Hybrids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
POMs are gaining attention in metal nanocluster synthesis for their ability to impart unique structural and functional roles. This review highlights recent advances in POM&#8211;metal nanocluster hybrids, categorized as follows: (a) hybrids of POMs and metal nanoclusters stabilized by organic ligands, (b) metal nanoclusters stabilized by POMs as ligands, and (c) solid&#8208;state synthesis of metal nanoclusters using POM&#8208;defined scaffolds.








Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs) are structurally well&#8208;defined anionic metal&#8211;oxo clusters with diverse structural forms and distinctive physicochemical properties, including acidity/basicity, redox activity, and optical behavior. Over the past two decades, POMs have garnered increasing attention in metal nanocluster synthesis owing to their ability to impart unique structural and functional characteristics to these compounds. Initially, research in this field primarily focused on hybrid materials composed of POMs and metal nanoclusters stabilized by organic ligands. However, more recently, studies have demonstrated that POMs can themselves act as effective stabilizing ligands for the synthesis of atomically precise metal nanoclusters. These POM&#8208;stabilized metal nanoclusters exhibit synergistic and cooperative properties of metal nanocluster and POM components, enabling novel applications in fields such as catalysis, photochemistry, sensing, and electrochemistry. Notably, recent investigations into POM&#8211;metal nanocluster hybrids have demonstrated their potential as atomically precise counterparts to metal nanoparticle catalysts supported on bulk metal oxides, exhibiting the unique cooperative catalysis. This review provides a concise overview of POM&#8210;metal nanocluster hybrids, with an emphasis on recent advancements in synthetic methodologies, properties, and applications. Additionally, solid&#8208;state synthetic strategies leveraging the rigid structures and redox properties of POMs for the controlled formation of metal nanoclusters are discussed.

         <title>Xanthochrysanthones A&#8722;C, Novel Lobster&#8208;Shape Cinnamoyltriketone Dimers with Antiviral Activities from Xanthostemon chrysanthus</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three pairs of novel enantiomeric cinnamoyltriketone dimers (1&#8722;3) with unprecedented spiro[cyclohexane&#8208;1,2&#8242;&#8208;xanthene] or benzo[7,8]oxocino[4,5&#8208;b]chromene tetracyclic ring systems were isolated from Xanthostemon chrysanthus via a building blocks&#8208;based molecular network (BBMN) strategy.








Abstract
Three pairs of enantiomeric cinnamoyltriketone dimers, (+)&#8208; and (&#8722;)&#8208;xanthochrysanthones A&#8722;C [(+)&#8208; and (&#8722;)&#8208;1&#8211;3)], were recognized and obtained from Xanthostemon chrysanthus by employing the building blocks&#8208;based molecular network (BBMN) strategy. Compounds 1&#8211;3 featured two new types of lobster&#8208;shape carbon skeletons with unprecedented spiro[cyclohexane&#8208;1,2&#8242;&#8208;xanthene] or benzo[7,8]oxocino[4,5&#8208;b]chromene tetracyclic ring systems. Their structures with absolute configurations were established by comprehensive spectroscopic analyses, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and ECD calculations. Compounds 1&#8211;3 represent the first example of phloroglucinol derivatives that are biogenetically constructed by a De Mayo reaction followed by Michael addition. Additionally, compounds 1&#8211;3 exhibited significant antiviral activity against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Time&#8208;of&#8208;addition assays indicated that compound 3 specifically acts on the early stages of the virus replication process in RSV.

         <title>The vicinal&#8208;d iiodination of the HDDA&#8208;benzynes by N&#8208;Iodo&#8208; succinimide (NIS) through a radical pathway</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 1,2&#8208;diradical reactivity of the HDDA&#8208;benzynes (thermal) has not been explored well in comparison to their ionic reactivity. Accordingly, the radical trapping reactions of these reactive intermediates are very scarce in literature. Here in we report the iodine&#8208;radical trapping reaction of the HDDA&#8208;benzynes for the construction of structurally divergent vicinal&#8208;diiodo arenes. The N&#8208;iodosuccinimide (NIS) has been employed as the source of radical iodine under thermal heating conditions. The existence of the arene&#8208;radical intermediates and the radical mechanism has been supported by the EPR spectral analysis of the reaction mixture. Several fruitful control experiments suggested that the 4&#8208;iodination (mono&#8208;) of the HDDA&#8208;benzynes is faster than the 5&#8208;iodiniation. The process is general in terms of substituents on the diynes as well as the nature of the tethering units. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report on the vicinal&#8208;diiodination as well as radical diiodination of HDDA&#8208;benzynes.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition Metal/Metal Sulfide Heterostructures Boost Energy&#8208;Saving Hydrogen Production Coupled with Sulfion Degradation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen production through the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) provides a promising pathway for sustainable and green energy. Coupling HER with the thermodynamically favorable sulfion oxidation reaction (SOR) can reduce energy consumption and recycle industrial by&#8208;product S2&#8722;. However, the development and practical application are hindered by the lack of cost&#8208;effective and robust catalysts. Herein, we constructed a bifunctional electrode with rich metal/metal sulfide heterostructures using NiFe foam through stepwise electrodeposition and hydrothermal sulfurization (NiFe&#8208;CrCoMo&#8208;S). Benefiting from the hydrophilic and sulfur&#8208;repellent surface and rich metal/metal sulfide heterostructures, it delivers outstanding SOR and HER performance. The integrated cell, utilizing the NiFe&#8208;CrCoMo&#8208;S electrode for both the cathode and anode, achieves a remarkable cell voltage of 0.75 V at a current density of 200 mA cm&#8722;2, which is 1.43 V lower than conventional water electrolysis. It demonstrates extraordinary long&#8208;term durability over 1100 hours without significant decay, achieving high Faradaic efficiencies (&#8805;99%) and low electricity consumption (1.79 kWh m&#8722;3 H2) for hydrogen production. This work paves the way for environmentally friendly strategies, combining cost&#8208;effective hydrogen production with value&#8208;added sulfur recovery, offering a reliable option for bifunctional catalyst design.</dc:description>

         <title>Impacts of Chalcogen Bonding on the Stability and Reactivity of 5&#8208;Iminothianthrene Platform: Toward Electrophilic Nitrogen Sources</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The thianthrene scaffold has recently attracted significant attention in various coupling reactions. Although 5&#8208;iminothianthrene and its derivatives are expected to function as electrophilic aminating reagents, their properties and reactivity have not been fully investigated. In this work, it was found that 5&#8208;iminothianthrene reacted with various electrophiles, such as acid chlorides, protons, and isothiocyanates to give the corresponding adducts. In addition, intramolecular chalcogen bonding (ChB) was identified in those adducts, and this interaction was found to contribute to their stability and reactivity. Finally, the potential of N&#8208;acyliminothianthrenes as N&#8208;acylnitrene equivalents were demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We present here a series of isomeric disulfide&#8208;based hybrid cyclic peptides with different ring sizes. The water soluble pseudopeptidic macrocycles display a high intrinsic tendency to self&#8208;assemble. Microscopic investigations revealed amyloid like fibrillar morphology with autofluorescence. X&#8208;ray crystal structure of 23&#8208;membered macrocycle showed the presence of intra molecular hydrogen bonding and a unique S&#183;&#183;&#183;O interaction. We delineate that the macrocyclic framework is an ideal platform to generate various classes of disulfide conformations. X&#8208;ray structure of the macrocycle further revealed the presence of an allosteric disulfide bond with &#8208;LHHook geometry.</dc:description>

         <title>Binuclear Lanthanide Complexes as Magnetic Resonance and Optical Imaging Probes for Redox Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Binuclear lanthanide complexes bearing nitrophenol, azophenol and azide chromophores can be reduced to the amine, giving rise to dramatic changes in the luminescence behavior. Such reductions can be achieved using enzymes as well as by chemical means. The tunable redox response and imaging modalities of these versatile complexes have the potential to open up new approaches to redox sensing.








Abstract
We report a family of lanthanide(III) complexes that act as redox probes via both magnetic resonance (MR) and luminescence outputs. The ligands are functionalized with nitro, azobenzene and azide groups which are reduced to a common aniline product, and each responds to both chemical and biocatalytic reductive conditions at different cathodic onset potentials. By judicious choice of complexed Ln(III), the probes can be optimized either for use in MR imaging (Ln&#160;=&#160;Gd), or as highly efficient turn&#8208;on luminescence probes (Ln&#160;=&#160;Tb). The Tb(III) analogues are essentially nonemissive, until reductive generation of the aniline affords a complex which when excited by visible light (488&#160;nm) emits green light with a quantum yield of 45% and millisecond long luminescent lifetimes (ms). The tunable redox response and imaging modalities of these versatile complexes have the potential to open up new approaches to redox sensing, such as the imaging of hypoxic environments in biology.

         <title>Localized Breakdown of the Niobium Anodic Oxide Film by Bromides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bromide&#8208;induced localized breakdown of niobium anodic oxide films&#160;depends on the bromide concentration and potential scan rate. Related experimental relationships agree with the predictions of a point defect model (PDM) under certain conditions. Within the same potential region, niobium maintains passivity in the more aggressive chloride media. PDM is used to explain the bromide&#8208;induced localized corrosion of niobium






.

Abstract
The growth of the anodic oxide passive film on Nb and its stability were studied in aqueous bromide media. Potentiodynamic polarization up to 12 VSCE showed that passive Nb loses its stability resulting in either metastable or stable pitting corrosion depending on the bromide concentration and the potential scan rate. On the contrary, Nb remains passive in the more aggressive chloride media where most passive metals and alloys are often susceptible to localized breakdown. This unusual bromide&#8208;induced localized breakdown of passive Nb occurs for bromide concentrations higher than 0.25&#160;M at a critical breakdown potential (Eb). Stable active dissolution in pits was observed at potentials higher than Eb. &#932;&#959; get an insight into the physicochemical processes responsible for the susceptibility of Nb to the bromide&#8208;induced localized corrosion, the oxide growth and its breakdown are discussed in terms of a point defect model (PDM). Experimental relationships between Eb and either the bromide activity or the potential scan rate agree with the PDM predictions. The bromide&#8208;induced localized breakdown of passive Nb seems to be associated with the absorption of bromides preferably on lattice anion vacancies at the oxide|electrolyte interface leading through a series of processes to vacancy condensation at the Nb|oxide interface.

         <title>Highly Emissive Hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;benzocoronene&#8208;fluoranthene Hybrid as Easily Processable and Stable OLED Material</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;symmetry&#8208;broken&#8221; hexabenzocoronene&#8208;fluoranthene fluorescent dye was synthesized using an easily scalable reaction. Green emission at around 500&#160;nm, a maximum photoluminescence quantum yield of 67% in toluene, and high solubility in a wide range of solvents result from the distorted structure. A green organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) was fabricated without extensive optimization showcasing easy processability of the molecule class.








Abstract
We report the synthesis of a fluorescent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon dye with a &#8220;symmetry&#8208;broken&#8221; core, derived from the related hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;benzocoronene (HBC) core with a fluoranthene subunit. The fluorophore is composed of a pure carbon skeleton without heteroatoms and exhibits remarkable photoluminescence properties with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of up to 67% in toluene, exceeding that of the parent HBC by a factor of 30. The single crystal X&#8208;ray structure reveals the distorted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon structure, which is responsible for the optoelectronic properties, as supported by density functional theory calculations. We show that the new fluorescent dye can be readily used for the fabrication of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLED) without extensive optimization, whereby solubility in a variety of solvents and successful film formation are decisive.

&lt;p&gt;We report the synthesis of a fluorescent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon dye with a &#8220;symmetry-broken&#8221; core, derived from the related hexa-&lt;i&gt;peri&lt;/i&gt;-benzocoronene (HBC) core with a fluoranthene subunit. The fluorophore is composed of a pure carbon skeleton without heteroatoms and exhibits remarkable photoluminescence properties with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of up to 67% in toluene, exceeding that of the parent HBC by a factor of 30. The single crystal X-ray structure reveals the distorted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon structure, which is responsible for the optoelectronic properties, as supported by density functional theory calculations. We show that the new fluorescent dye can be readily used for the fabrication of organic light-emitting diodes (OLED) without extensive optimization, whereby solubility in a variety of solvents and successful film formation are decisive.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Excited State Branching Processes in a Ru(II)&#8208;Based Donor&#8211;Acceptor&#8211;Donor System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoinduced electron transfer processes in a Ru(II)&#8208;based push&#8211;pull&#8211;push architecture which combines an inorganic and organic chromophore are elucidated in a joint spectroscopic&#8208;theoretical approach. The applied design concept allows the excited state to be localized away from the metal onto the organic chromophore.








Abstract
Excited state properties such as excitation energy, accessibility of the respective excited state either by direct or indirect population transfer, and its lifetime govern the application of these excited states in light&#8208;driven reactions, for example, photocatalysis using transition metal complexes. Compared with triplet metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MLCT) states, charge&#8208;separated (3CS) excited states involving organic moieties, such as triplet intra&#8208;ligand or ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3ILCT and 3LLCT) states, tend to possess longer&#8208;lived excited states due to the weak spin&#8208;orbit coupling with the closed&#8208;shell ground state. Thus, the combination of inorganic and organic chromophores enables isolating the triplet states onto the organic chromophore. In this study, we aim to elucidate the excited&#8208;state relaxation processes in a Ru(II)&#8208;terpyridyl donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor system (RuCl) in a joint spectroscopic&#8208;theoretical approach combining steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy as well as quantum chemical simulations and dissipative quantum dynamics. The electron transfer (ET) processes involving the low&#8208;lying 3MLCT, 3ILCT, and 3LLCT excited states were investigated experimentally and computationally within a semiclassical Marcus picture. Finally, dissipative quantum dynamical simulations&#8212;capable of describing incomplete ET processes involving all three states&#8212;enabled us to unravel the competitive relaxation channels at short and long timescales among the strongly coupled 3MLCT&#8208;3ILCT states and weakly coupled 3MLCT&#8208;3LLCT and 3ILCT&#8208;3LLCT states.

         <title>Tumor Suppression by Targeting Senescent Cells with a Selective Singlet Oxygen Releasing Endoperoxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#946;&#8208;Galactosidase&#8208;triggered release of singlet oxygen is shown to target and selectively eliminate senescent cells. In addition, data obtained using tumor models reveal a significant suppression of tumor progression by targeted singlet oxygen release.








Abstract
Targeting senescent cells for cancer treatment is an important recent direction. In this work, we designed and synthesized a galactoside&#8208;functionalized pyridone endoperoxide. The endoperoxide in this form, releases singlet oxygen at a relatively slow rate, but when transformed by &#946;&#8208;galactosidase activity, the pyridone endoperoxide releases singlet oxygen with a half&#8208;life of 30 minutes at 37 &#176;C. We also studied this compound with a variety of cell lines with differential &#946;&#8208;galactosidase expression levels. Cytotoxicity of the target compound is enhanced in high galactosidase&#8208;expressing SKOV&#8208;3 cells. In vivo tests with tumor models also showed significant suppression of tumor progression. Targeting singlet oxygen to senescent cells appears to be promising new approach for treating diseases concurrent with aging, including cancer.

         <title>Toward Symmetric Organic Aqueous Flow Batteries: Triarylamine&#8208;Based Bipolar Molecules and Their Characterization via an Extended Kouteck&#253;&#8211;Levich Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bipolar redox&#8208;active organic molecules based on a triarylamine skeleton and a viologen unit for pH&#8208;neutral aqueous flow batteries are presented. Cyclic voltammetry shows that only viologen with a highly hydrophilic substituent, connected to the TAA moiety can be reversibly reduced. A modified Kouteck&#253;&#8211;Levich analysis is presented to investigate the observed potential&#8208;dependent currents at the hydrodynamically dominated region.








Abstract
Symmetric organic flow batteries (SOFBs) can potentially address membrane crossover problems by employing bipolar redox&#8208;active organic molecules (BROMs). Herein, a triarylamine (TAA) skeleton was chosen as a posolyte moiety for a new class of bipolar molecules for pH&#8208;neutral aqueous flow batteries (FBs). Pyridinium and viologen derivatives were tethered to the posolyte moiety, and the new compounds were characterized. Cyclic voltammetry revealed that only viologen with a highly hydrophilic substituent, connected to the TAA moiety via a Zincke reaction, could be reversibly reduced. Varying the supporting electrolyte concentration on the selected derivative revealed water solubility as a challenge for further development. The selected derivative, MeO&#8208;TPA&#8208;Vi&#8208;DMAE, was subjected to hydrodynamic voltammetry, and a modified Kouteck&#253;&#8211;Levich analysis was developed to investigate the observed potential&#8208;dependent currents at the hydrodynamically dominated region, which are often seen with redox&#8208;active organic molecules. This model discarded a purely Ohmic effect, showing a useful Levich slope at a certain overpotential before the onset of a secondary reaction. TAA&#8208;based BROMs hold promise for pH&#8208;neutral aqueous SOFBs, and the results will guide the design of new derivatives. The three&#8208;term Kouteck&#253;&#8211;Levich relation here introduced will be useful not only to develop BROM&#8208;based FBs but will most likely appeal to a much broader audience.

         <title>Dense Li Deposition and Enhanced Flame&#8208;retardant Enabled by Localized Strong Ion&#8208;Dipole Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We successfully designed a localized strong ion&#8208;dipole interactions&#8208;based electrolyte with solvation structure involving dual anions. The electrolyte not only exhibits excellent flame retardancy, but also forms a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) for dense Li deposition, which significantly improves the cycling life of Li metal batteries.








Abstract
Uncontrolled lithium (Li) deposition can lead to the formation of dendrites and &#8220;dead&#8221; Li, accelerating the degradation of cycling stability and safety performance in lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, we propose a strategy to achieve dense Li deposition and flame&#8208;retardant by designing an electrolyte based on localized strong ion&#8208;dipole (LSID) interactions. The strong ion&#8208;dipole interactions between the multiple&#8208;dipole solvent (G4), NO3&#8722;, FSI&#8722;, and Li+ promote the formation of Li+ primary solvation sheaths for stabilizing Li deposition behavior. While the weak dipole fluorine&#8208;containing diluent (TTE) is distributed in the secondary solvation sheath due to weak ion&#8208;dipole interactions of Li+&#8208;TTE to improve interfacial wettability and flame retardancy due to preferential separation. Consequently, the localized strong ion&#8208;dipole interactions strategy in the designed electrolyte successfully achieves a Coulombic efficiency of more than 99% for Li||Cu cells, and ultrathin Li&#8208;matched Li||LFP and Li||NCM523 cells also demonstrate excellent cycling stability, as well as an improved safety performance of LMBs.

ML accelerates sustainable polymer development by replacing resource&#8208;extensive trial&#8208;and&#8208;error methods with efficient predictive modeling for catalyst discovery, polymer property optimization and new material design.








Abstract
Sustainable polymers from renewable resources have been gaining importance due to their recyclability and reduced environmental impact. However, their development through conventional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error methods remains inefficient and resource&#8208;intensive. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool in polymer science, enabling rapid prediction, and discovery of new chemicals and materials. In this review, we examine emerging trends in ML applications for sustainable polymer development, focusing on catalyst discovery, property optimization, and new polymer design. We analyze unique challenges in applying ML to sustainable polymers and evaluate proposed solutions, providing insights for future development in this rapidly evolving field.

         <title>Endohedral Coordination of Bulky Substrates in Metalloenzyme&#8208;Like Organometallic Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organometallic nanotube with eight CuI ions mimics metalloenzyme behavior, featuring a flexible pore, metal&#8208;ligand substrate binding, and redox&#8208;active metals. Insertion of THF as a model substrate is driven by coordination, as confirmed by SC&#8208;XRD, NMR, and DFT. Electrochemical studies of a derived rotaxane reveal metal&#8208;centered redox activity.

Abstract
Artificial receptors inspired by metalloenzymes share three key properties: a structurally flexible cavity, substrate binding via metal&#8208;ligand coordination, and metal&#8208;based redox activity. Herein, we report an organometallic nanotube with such features based on our supramolecular pillarplex platform, incorporating eight CuI centers in its cavitand walls. The structurally adaptable cavity of this receptor enables the endohedral coordination of tetrahydrofuran (THF) as a hydrophilic model substrate with remarkable binding affinity despite a steric mismatch between the host and guest. Evidence from SC&#8208;XRD, 1H NMR titration in aqueous solution, and DFT modelling confirms that metal&#8208;ligand coordination governs substrate binding. Electrochemical analysis of a derived rotaxane reveals metal&#8208;centered redox activity.

         <title>Click&#8208;Functionalized Cyanine Fluorogenic Dimers for Improved Detection of GPCRs: Application to Imaging of ApelinR in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A click&#8208;mediated functionalization of a cyanine 5.5 bearing a terminal alkyne gave a rapid access to a library of ten new cyanine dyes and their corresponding dimers. A structure&#8208;interaction relationship study led to the identification of an optimal dimer which was conjugated to the apelin&#8208;17 ligand and enabled imaging of ApelinR under no&#8208;wash conditions.








Abstract
Fluorogenic dimers enable background&#8208;free imaging of biological targets under wash&#8208;free conditions owing to a strong fluorescence enhancement in the apolar cell microenvironment. However, it is crucial that the imaging probe interacts solely with the target receptor to avoid nonspecific interactions and ensure detection with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. Herein, we describe a convenient and rapid approach for the synthesis of various functionalized cyanine dyes by click chemistry allowing the fine&#8208;tuning of the physicochemical and fluorogenic properties of the dimers. A structure&#8208;interaction relationship study was conducted for the fluorogenic dimers in the presence of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and liposomes as models of serum proteins and cell membranes. We identified d&#9472;Cy&#9472;E which combined the lowest nonspecific interactions with the optimal fluorescence turn&#8208;on properties. By conjugating d&#9472;Cy&#9472;E to a peptide ligand of the apelin GPCR, we developed Ap&#9472;d&#9472;Cy&#9472;E, the first fluorescent turn&#8208;on probe for the background&#8208;free imaging of this receptor in living cells.

         <title>Development of Water&#8208;Soluble 3&#8208;Nitro&#8208;2&#8208;Pyridinesulfenate for Disulfide Bond Formation of Peptide Under Aqueous Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly water&#8208;soluble Npy&#8208;sulfenate functions as an efficient oxidizing agent for the formation of disulfide bonds in thiol&#8208;containing peptides. The Npy&#8208;sulfenate can be used to form a disulfide bond with a thiol&#8208;containing peptide produced by thiol&#8208;additive&#8208;free NCL, thereby facilitating the one&#8208;pot synthesis of adrenomedullin. These results provide a new one&#8208;pot synthetic methodology for cyclic disulfide peptides based on sulfenate&#8208;mediated oxidation.








Abstract
Establishing an efficient method for the synthesis of disulfide bonds in peptides is an important challenge for the further development of several research fields, including peptide&#8208;based medicinal chemistry and biochemistry. Herein, we report the development of a novel highly water&#8208;soluble 3&#8208;nitro&#8208;2&#8208;pyridine (Npy) sulfenate that efficiently forms intramolecular disulfide bonds in reduced peptides. Moreover, Npy&#8208;sulfenate formed a disulfide bond in a thiol&#8208;containing peptide prepared by thiol&#8208;additive&#8208;free native chemical ligation (NCL), as demonstrated by the one&#8208;pot synthesis of adrenomedullin, which contains 52 amino acid residues. This study provides a new one&#8208;pot synthetic methodology for preparing mid&#8208;sized cyclic disulfide peptides via sulfenate&#8208;mediated oxidation.

         <title>Synthetic Studies on Enantioselective Total Syntheses of Tabercarpamines and Voacangine&#8208;Type Indole Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unified catalytic asymmetric total syntheses of (iso)voacangines, 3&#8208;oxo&#8208;(iso)voacangines, and (3S)&#8208;cyano(iso)voacangines were achieved for the first time. The syntheses hinged on a catalytic asymmetric Michael/aldol reaction for the construction of chiral aza&#8208;[3.3.1]&#8208;bridged bicyclic framework at the early stage and a ring reconstruction from [3.3.1]&#8208; to [2.2.2]&#8208;bicyclic ring system at the late stage.








Abstract
The proposed post&#8208;iboga natural products, (+)&#8208;tabercarpamines G and I, along with their corresponding C20 stereoisomers and C10&#8208;methoxy&#8208;regioisomers were synthesized. An extensive NMR spectroscopic study showed that the spectral data of these synthetic compounds were not consistent with the proposed (+)&#8208;tabercarpamines G and I in isolation report, indicating that the proposed structures were misassigned. Subsequently, from the advanced intermediates for the synthesis of the proposed (+)&#8208;tabercarpamines G and I, the unified enantioselective syntheses of six iboga&#8210;type natural products including (&#8208;)&#8208;isovoacangine and (&#8208;)&#8208;voacangine, (&#8208;)&#8208;3&#8208;oxo&#8208;isovoacangine and (&#8208;)&#8208;3&#8208;oxo&#8208;voacangine, and (&#8208;)&#8208;(3S)&#8208;cyanoisovoacangine and (&#8208;)&#8208;(3S)&#8208;cyanovoacangine were accomplished via a divergent manner. The synthetic route provided the first catalytic asymmetric approach to access these three types of iboga&#8210;type natural products and achieved the first enantioselective syntheses of (3S)&#8208;cyano(iso)voacangines. Our synthesis hinged on a catalytic asymmetric Michael/aldol reaction for the construction of chiral aza&#8208;[3.3.1]&#8208;bridged bicyclic framework at the early stage and a ring reorganization process from [3.3.1]&#8208; to [2.2.2]&#8208;bicyclic ring system&#8213;a pathway opposite to the proposed biogenic synthesis&#8213;at the late stage.

Abstract
N&#8208;glycosylation on asparagine is one of the most common post&#8208;translational modifications of proteins. The synthesis of homogeneous N&#8208;glycopeptides and glycoproteins is crucial for elucidating the concerted functions of glycans and peptides. Multiple endoglycosidase mutants have been developed to efficiently catalyze the coupling of oxazoline derivatives of N&#8208;glycans lacking the innermost N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) (mono&#8208;GlcNAc N&#8208;glycan) with peptide chains bearing a GlcNAcylated asparagine. However, the bottleneck for N&#8208;glycopeptide and glycoprotein synthesis remains access to these complex truncated N&#8208;glycan substrates in sufficient diversity and quantity. Here, we report a novel chemical method using modified oxidative release of natural glycans (ORNG) to produce a diverse library of mono&#8208;GlcNAc N&#8208;glycans and their oxazoline derivatives, paving the way for the facile synthesis of N&#8208;glycopeptides and glycoproteins. Using these substrates, homogeneous N&#8208;glycosylation of monoclonal antibodies can be efficiently achieved.

         <title>Ni(OH)x/Ni&#8208;Catalyzed In Situ Hydrogenation and Ethanol Ethoxylation of 2&#8208;Methylfuran for Renewable Biofuel Co&#8208;Upgrading</title>

Abstract
Bioethanol and furanics are currently prevailing additives to fossil&#8208;based transportation fuels. With the objective to lift the longstanding limitations of these biofuel additives, this work reports for the first time the synthesis of 2&#8208;ethoxy&#8208;2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran (2&#8208;EO&#8208;2&#8208;MTHF) as a co&#8208;upgraded fuel by reacting ethanol with 2&#8208;methylfuran (2&#8208;MF). The formation of 2&#8208;EO&#8208;2&#8208;MTHF is achieved through ethanol ethoxylation of 2&#8208;MF, enabled by a reverse Ni(OH)x/Ni catalyst under hydrogen pressure. Nickel hydroxide species over the Ni nanoparticles play a crucial role in activating ethanol and polarizing the partially hydrogenated dihydrofuran intermediates, favorably steering the reaction selectively toward the ethoxylation product. The reaction conditions, including pressure and temperature, are systematically optimized to enhance the yield of 2&#8208;EO&#8208;2&#8208;MTHF, and provide a means to beneficially tune the fuel compositions consisting mainly of 2&#8208;EO&#8208;2&#8208;MTHF and 2&#8208;MTHF, both are high energy density molecules. Importantly, the reverse Ni(OH)x&#8208;Ni catalyst allows a one&#8208;pot process to accomplish consecutive partial hydrogenation of 2&#8208;MF and ethanol ethoxylation. This work provides a practical strategy for upgrading biomass&#8208;derived polar primary fuel molecules into more versatile fuels and chemicals.

         <title>Quantitative Generation of HF from KF and Formation of Amine&#8208;3HF Complexes by Using Cation Exchange Reaction Between KF and Amberlyst 15DRY</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A safe and convenient method for the quantitative generation of HF from KF at room temperature was demonstrated using the cation exchange reaction between KF and Amberlyst 15DRY. The generated HF was quantitatively converted to a variety of amine&#8208;3HF complexes as candidates for nucleophilic fluorinating reagents.








Abstract
A safe and convenient method for the quantitative generation of hydrogen fluoride (HF) from potassium fluoride (KF) at room temperature was successfully demonstrated using the cation exchange reaction between KF and Amberlyst 15DRY in acetonitrile (MeCN). After one of the cation exchange reactions, HF was generated from KF in 69% yield. On the other hand, HF was generated quantitatively by removing the generated HF and repeating the cation exchange reaction seven times. During and after the cation exchange reaction, the generated HF was separated from the Amberlyst 15DRY by decantation and filtration without loss of HF. When the Amberlyst 15DRY was regenerated and then reused in the cation exchange reaction ten times, HF was generated almost quantitatively each time and the yield of HF did not decrease at all. In addition, when 1/3 equivalent of amines was added to the resulting HF&#8208;containing solution, a variety of amine&#8208;3HF complexes with controlled stoichiometric ratios were formed in quantitative yields.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Site CuZn Alloy Boosts Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia via Optimized Intermediate Adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intermetallic CuZn optimizes the nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) pathway by tuning the adsorption energies and configurations of NOx and NOxH (x&#160;=&#160;1, 2, and 3) intermediates. The synergistic effect between Cu and Zn sites breaks the scaling relationship and enhances catalytic activity.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) is an effective way to solve nitrate pollution and a promising strategy for ammonia (NH3) synthesis under ambient temperature and pressure. However, NO3RR is still hindered by the lack of efficient catalysts and an understanding of mechanisms that enhance the catalytic performance. In this study, we propose intermetallic alloying as a promising strategy to optimize the NO3RR reaction pathway by tuning the adsorption energies and configurations of intermediates, as demonstrated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations comparing NO3RR performance of Cu (111) and CuZn (110) surfaces. In CuZn alloy, the electron&#8208;donating property of Cu weakens the adsorption of NOx (x = 1, 2, and 3) intermediates, whereas the electron&#8208;accepting property of Zn strengthens the binding of NOxH intermediates, thus lowering the protonation reaction energy. Zn sites preferentially promote the removal of O species, whereas Cu sites dominate the protonation of N species. This synergistic effect enables CuZn (110) surface to successfully break the undesirable scaling relationship in traditional metal catalysts, resulting in excellent catalytic activity for NO3RR, with an ultra&#8208;low limiting potential of &#8722;0.28&#160;V. This work provides valuable insights and theoretical guidance for NO3RR.

A &#8220;butterfly&#8208;like&#8221; metal templated borate, [Co2(bpy)4(C2O4)]&#183;[B5O6(OH)4]2&#183;py2 (1, bpy&#160;=&#160;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine, py&#160;=&#160;pyridine), was synthesized via a solvothermal method. For the first time, the coordination of Co2+ ions with (C2O4)2&#8722; ions in borate systems was observed. Notably, upon pyrolyzing precursor compound 1, high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) revealed a catalyst with a carbon&#8208;supported Co nanocrystal structure, which significantly enhanced the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance, achieving a half&#8208;wave potential comparable to that of Pt/C. More importantly, the catalyst outperformed Pt/C when applied in a zinc&#8208;air battery.

         <title>The Effect of Aldehyde and Carboxylic Acid Substitution on the Isomerization of Hemithioindigo Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The core of an HTI photoswitch with different oxidation states of the sulfur heteroatom was modified by introducing aldehydes and carboxylic acid substituents for tailored absorption, quantum yields, and thermal stability. Notably, the substituted HTIs enabled high isomerization yields, while sulfur oxidation enhanced quantum yields but reduces photochromism. Solid&#8208;state photoisomerization was demonstrated on an HTI that was incorporated into a MOF.








Abstract
Hemithioindigo (HTI) photoswitches exhibit robust photoisomerization under visible light and relatively high thermal bistability. In this work, we report various modifications of the HTI core, namely the introduction of aldehydes and carboxylic acids at the para position of the stilbene fragment with different oxidation states of the sulfur center, and the incorporation of a Schiff base moiety. These modifications allowed tuning of the absorption properties, quantum yields of isomerization, and thermal stability of the metastable E&#8208;isomers. Notably, the formyl&#8208; and carboxyl&#8208;substituted HTI switches achieved high yields of isomerization under visible light in various solvents, while sulfur oxidation enhanced quantum yields but reduced photochromism. Schiff base formation led to red&#8208;shifted absorption and increased thermal stability. Finally, by leveraging the carboxyl substituents, we incorporated an HTI chromophore into the NU&#8208;1000 metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), and demonstrated solid&#8208;state photoisomerization. These findings highlight key structural modifications that expand the applicability of HTI photoswitches for molecular switching in solution and solid&#8208;state environments.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Application of Covalent Organic Framework &#8208; Based Ionic Conductors in Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), known for their tunable porosity and functional versatility, have demonstrated exceptional ionic conductivity in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). This review summarizes recent advancements in COF&#8208;based materials for PEMFC applications, emphasizing their roles as intrinsic proton conductors, host matrices for proton carriers, and additives in composite ionomers/membranes. Key strategies such as pore engineering, functional group modification, and hybrid designs with polymers are analyzed to highlight their influence on proton conductivity and mechanical stability. Recent developments reveal that functionalized COFs can achieve proton conductivities exceeding 0.89 S cm&#8210;1 at 90&#176;C under 100% relative humidity (RH), comparable to commercial Nafion membranes. Additionally, COF&#8208;modified ionomers applied to catalyst layers have enabled fuel cells to achieve peak power densities 1.6 times higher than those without COF incorporation. Despite these advancements, challenges persist in terms of membrane durability, scalability, and performance under low humidity or high&#8208;temperature conditions. Future research should prioritize structural optimization, interfacial compatibility, and cost&#8208;effective synthesis methods to fully realize the potential of COFs in next&#8208;generation PEMFCs. This review underscores the transformative potential of COFs in addressing the critical limitations of traditional proton&#8208;conducting materials, paving the way for innovative solutions in fuel cell technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking the Room Temperature Phosphorescence through Halogen Engineering in Carbazole Dimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategic incorporation of bromine into the carbazole dimer enables an efficient transition from thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) in crystalline Cz&#8208;D to predominantly room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in crystalline BrCz&#8208;D, demonstrating a versatile strategy for modulating luminescent&#160;properties.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in metal&#8208;free organic materials offers immense potential for advanced optoelectronic applications. However, the rational design and fine&#8208;tuning of RTP remain challenging due to the complex correlation between molecular structure and photophysical processes. Herein, we explored the impact of intersystem crossing (ISC), spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC), and halogen interactions to promote RTP in crystalline brominated carbazole dimer (BrCz&#8208;D). In contrast, the unsubstituted analogue, carbazole dimer (Cz&#8208;D) exhibits thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) under ambient conditions. Femtosecond transient absorption (fsTA) spectroscopy measurements confirmed the population of triplet manifolds in both dimers. Bromine substitution significantly enhances spin&#8208;orbit coupling (VSOC&#160;=&#160;14.94 cm&#8315;&#185;), enabling efficient ISC and robust RTP in BrCz&#8208;D. Enhanced RTP in crystalline BrCz&#8208;D is attributed to unique halogen interactions, including Br&#183;&#183;&#183;Br, C&#183;&#183;&#183;Br, and H&#183;&#183;&#183;Br, within the crystal lattice. Such halogen interactions are negligible in the solution state, accounting for the lack of RTP under ambient conditions. The present work highlights the critical role of SOC and halogen bonding in achieving efficient RTP for designing high&#8208;performance organic phosphorescent materials through crystallochemistry.

         <title>Single Crystals of a Covalent Organic Polymer for Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports the preparation of 1D polymer single crystals (CityU&#8208;49) based on dative boron&#8208;nitrogen bonds. The dynamic B&#8592;N bonds enabled precise self&#8208;assembly and high crystallinity. CityU&#8208;49 has been demonstrated to show excellent photocatalytic activity, achieving 95% degradation of rhodamine B in 300 minutes highlighting its potential for environmental remediation and advancing the design of crystalline covalent organic polymers.








Abstract
Covalent organic polymers (COPs) with high crystallinity and excellent stability is very important for potential applications in photocatalysis and environmental remediation. However, most COPs are amorphous, limiting their structural characterization, photocatalytic performance, and mechanism exploration. In this study, we report the construction of a crystalline 1D COP (CityU&#8208;49) via dative boron&#8592;nitrogen (B&#8592;N) bonds using 3,6&#8208;di(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole (DPC) as the nitrogen donor and 1,4&#8208;bis(benzodioxaborole) as the boron donor. The dynamic and directional nature of B&#8592;N bonds enables a self&#8208;healing and self&#8208;correcting assembly process resulting in a highly crystalline and stable structure. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) revealed the precise structure of CityU&#8208;49 providing insights into its ordered architecture. The photocatalytic performance of CityU&#8208;49 was conducted to investigat the degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) (a persistent and toxic organic pollutant). Under UV light irradiation, CityU&#8208;49 achieves 95% degradation of RhB in 300 minutes demonstrating excellent photocatalytic activity and environmental applicability. This study highlights the potential of crystalline COPs as efficient and sustainable photocatalysts paving the way for the development of advanced materials for environmental remediation and green technologies.

         <title>Exploiting Activated Alkyne Chemistry for the Synthesis of Tailored Amphiphilic Janus Dendrimers with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission and Their Assemblies for Cell Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amphiphilic Janus dendrimers (AJDs) synthesized via activated alkyne&#8208;hydroxyl &#8220;click&#8221; chemistry exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties and self&#8208;assemble into fluorescent nanostructures, including dendrimersomes and micelles. These assemblies, with excellent biocompatibility and efficient cellular uptake, demonstrate potential for live&#8208;cell imaging and nanomedicine applications. This work highlights an efficient approach for synthesizing AJDs for designing advanced nanomaterials with tunable optical properties.








Abstract
Amphiphilic Janus dendrimers (AJDs) are a promising class of macromolecules capable of self&#8208;assembling into well&#8208;defined nanostructures. In this study, AJDs were synthesized employing, for the first time, the activated alkyne&#8208;hydroxyl &#8220;click&#8221; chemistry approach, enabling the construction of dendritic architectures under mild conditions. The AJDs were functionalized with a &#960;&#8208;extended tetraphenylethylene (TPE) derivative, imparting aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) property. These AJDs self&#8208;assembled into fluorescent nanostructures, including micelles and dendrimersomes, with tunable dimensions. The AIE&#8208;active assemblies demonstrated strong photoluminescence upon formation and were characterized by narrow size distributions. Cytotoxicity and cellular uptake studies using Chinese Hamster Ovary K1 (CHO&#8208;K1) cells revealed excellent biocompatibility and efficient cellular internalization, confirming their potential for live&#8208;cell imaging. Importantly, the extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation of the TPE derivative facilitated excitation at longer wavelengths, compatible with conventional confocal microscopy. This work showcases the versatility of activated alkyne&#8208;hydroxyl &#8220;click&#8221; chemistry in dendrimer synthesis and highlights the potential of these AJD&#8208;based nanostructures in nanomedicine, particularly for imaging and diagnostic applications.

&lt;p&gt;Amphiphilic Janus dendrimers (AJDs) are a promising class of macromolecules capable of self-assembling into well-defined nanostructures. In this study, AJDs were synthesized employing, for the first time, the activated alkyne-hydroxyl &#8220;click&#8221; chemistry approach, enabling the construction of dendritic architectures under mild conditions. The AJDs were functionalized with a &#960;-extended tetraphenylethylene (TPE) derivative, imparting aggregation-induced emission (AIE) property. These AJDs self-assembled into fluorescent nanostructures, including micelles and dendrimersomes, with tunable dimensions. The AIE-active assemblies demonstrated strong photoluminescence upon formation and were characterized by narrow size distributions. Cytotoxicity and cellular uptake studies using Chinese Hamster Ovary K1 (CHO-K1) cells revealed excellent biocompatibility and efficient cellular internalization, confirming their potential for live-cell imaging. Importantly, the extended &#960;-conjugation of the TPE derivative facilitated excitation at longer wavelengths, compatible with conventional confocal microscopy. This work showcases the versatility of activated alkyne-hydroxyl &#8220;click&#8221; chemistry in dendrimer synthesis and highlights the potential of these AJD-based nanostructures in nanomedicine, particularly for imaging and diagnostic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>DNA&#8208;Binding Properties of Non&#8208;Intercalating Water&#8208;Soluble Organometallic Ir(III) Luminophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of water&#8208;soluble, organometallic iridium(III) complexes has been studied with respect to their DNA binding behavior. A combined biophysical and computational study reveals the subtle interplay of non&#8208;intercalative DNA binding events that are modulated by small changes in ligand structure.








Abstract
A series of Ir(III) complexes, [Ir(C^N)2(en)]+ (where C^N&#160;=&#160;2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;benzo[d]thiazolyl cyclometalating ligand; en&#160;=&#160;ethylene diamine), is reported with structural variation via a substituent (H, Me, OMe, Cl, OCF3) at the coordinated phenyl ring. The complexes were soluble in aqueous buffer, with solubility limits correlating inversely with the predicted logP. The complexes display efficient visible absorption at 400&#8211;500&#160;nm (&#949; &#8764; 5000&#160;M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1) due to charge&#8208;transfer transitions and are triplet emitters in aerated buffer (&#955;em&#160;=&#160;529&#8211;540&#160;nm; lifetimes up to 0.763 &#181;s; &#934;em&#160;&#8804;&#160;12%). Each complex was investigated, via computational and biophysical experiments, in the context of DNA binding. According to UV&#8208;visible titrations, the cationic complexes bind to DNA with apparent affinities ranging from 6&#160;&#215;&#160;104 to 5&#160;&#215;&#160;105&#160;M&#8722;1 with apparent binding site sizes between 0.4 and 1.0 base pairs. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) showed that complexes [Ir(L1&#8208;3)2(en)]Cl bind to DNA in two types of binding sites, viz., a high&#8208;affinity (107&#8211;108&#160;M&#8722;1) binding site with characteristics of minor or major groove binding and a low&#8208;affinity binding site (105&#160;M&#8722;1) with characteristics of non&#8208;specific binding to negatively charged DNA, with binding supported by hydrophobic interactions between complexes.

         <title>Two&#8208;photon Excitation of Bright Diaza[4]Helicenes for Isotropic and Circularly Polarized Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tris&#8208;p&#8208;OMe cationic diaza[4]helicenes with improved (CPL) brightness (up to 3.4 M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1 for 2d) are achieved by combining high &#934;f and enhanced chiroptical properties arising with branched N&#8208;substituents. Efficient 2PE at 810&#160;nm and 2PE CPL spectra are reported, the latter being uncommon for small organic molecules. Their viability in cell imaging by 1PE and 2PE confocal microscopy was also proven.








Abstract
Helicenes are chiral organic dyes that are attracting growing attention due to the high tunability of their (chir)optical and electronic properties. In this work, a series of functionalized cationic diaza[4]helicenes based on dimethoxyquinacridinium (DMQA) scaffolds are presented. By merging branched N&#8208;alkyl side chains and triple para&#8208;functionalization with OMe groups, structures combine improved chiroptical responses (5x increase) and strong fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;f&#160;&#8776;&#160;70% in acetonitrile). An overall improved efficiency of the emission of circularly polarized light with BCPL values reaching 3.4 M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1 is obtained. Additionally, two&#8208;photon excitation (2PE) studies were performed, showing good values of cross section (CS) at 810&#160;nm. Interestingly, 2PE circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectra were acquired for the most performant derivatives (N&#8208;isopropyl and N&#8208;cyclohexyl); this type of measurement being usually challenging for organic molecular species. Finally, the viability of these compounds in single&#8208;photon (1PE)&#160;and 2PE microscopy is also shown.

         <title>Higher BODIPY Homologues&#8211;Synthesis, Reactivity, and Photoluminescence Investigations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Higher homologues of the well&#8208;known BODIPY dyes for boron, aluminum, gallium, and indium are described. These have been obtained with the halogen substituents chlorine, bromine, and iodine and as mixed substituted compounds with methyl and halogen substituents. The optical properties are described as well as the observation of excimers.








Abstract
The synthesis of MesDPM group 13 (B&#9472;In, MesDPM&#160;=&#160;1,5,9&#8208;trimesityldipyrromethene) compounds with halide substituents (Cl&#9472;I) is described. All compounds were fully characterized including NMR and IR spectroscopy as well as mass spectrometry. In addition, the solid state molecular structures have been determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. As higher representatives of BODIPY (boron difluoride dipyrromethene) dyes, some of these MesDPM triel dihalides also exhibit an intense green fluorescence when exposed to sunlight. In this regard, the optical properties were investigated by UV/Vis and photoluminescence spectroscopy giving absorption maxima around 520&#160;nm and fluorescence emission in the range between 550 and 660&#160;nm. Fluorescence quantum efficiencies up to 42% could be obtained from measurements in toluene solution. Further, reactivity studies were carried out which opened&#8208;up access to mixed substituted MesDPM triels with one alkyl and one halide substituent.

         <title>Data&#8208;Driven Prediction of Reactivity and Additive Selection for C(sp2)&#8211;(Hetero)Atom Bond Couplings in an Adaptive Dynamic Homogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The AD&#8208;HoC platform streamlines photocatalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions, eliminating catalyst, ligand, and base optimization. Machine learning predicts reactivity and selects additives using substrate electronic and geometric traits. Quantum mechanical calculations and cheminformatics enhance understanding, while an end&#8208;to&#8208;end tool predicts outcomes from SMILES (Simplified Molecular&#8208;Input Line&#8208;Entry System) boosting synthetic precision and efficiency.








Abstract
Under visible light&#8208;driven redox conditions, employing transition&#8208;metal catalysis provides a powerful platform for constructing C(sp2)&#8211;(hetero)atom bonds. Although these reactions are highly significant, they require precise optimization of reaction parameters. K&#246;nig, Ghosh, and colleagues introduced an adaptive dynamic homogeneous catalysis (AD&#8208;HoC) platform that furnishes robust, high&#8208;yield conditions for photocatalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The AD&#8208;HoC system eliminates the need to optimize catalysts, ligands, and bases, instead, it achieves C(sp2)&#8211;(hetero)atom bond coupling by merely altering additives and substrate molecules. Leveraging the predictability of reaction conditions within the AD&#8208;HoC system, machine learning offers a method to evaluate the reactivity of substrate combinations and the categories of additives. Our research integrates high&#8208;throughput quantum mechanical calculations with cheminformatics approaches to explore the reactivity of substrate combinations and the selection of additives within the AD&#8208;HoC system. Further data&#8208;driven analysis reveals that the electronic characteristics of electrophiles and the geometric characteristics of nucleophiles are key factors regulating reactivity within the AD&#8208;HoC system. Herein, we present an end&#8208;to&#8208;end tool for prediction starting from the SMILES (Simplified Molecular&#8208;Input Line&#8208;Entry System) representation. This work demonstrates the collaborative use of computational statistics and machine learning to predict the reactivity and reaction conditions of substrate combinations, thereby enhancing the precision and efficiency of synthetic processes.

Herein, we present an end-to-end tool for prediction starting from the SMILES (Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System) representation. This work demonstrates the collaborative use of computational statistics and machine learning to predict the reactivity and reaction conditions of substrate combinations, thereby enhancing the precision and efficiency of synthetic processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tandem ADMET and CAMMP to Access Degradable Thermosets and Multiblock Copolymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diene small molecule monomers, serving as monomers, are polymerized via ADMET to produce macromonomers with varying degrees of polymerization. By judiciously selecting copolymerizable cycloolefin monomers, this approach enables the one&#8208;pot synthesis of highly degradable thermosetting materials and multiblock copolymers that exhibit excellent material properties.








Abstract
The development of degradable polymers and multiblock copolymeric (MBCP) compatibilizers represents an appealing strategy to address ever&#8208;growing concerns for treating waste plastics of traditional chemical degradation or mechanical recycling. Although recent advancements in cyclic&#8211;acyclic monomers metathesis polymerization (CAMMP) and tandem olefin metathesis polymerization (TOMP) have recently been reported to produce degradable polymers and MBCPs via copolymerization of cyclic monomers with acyclic diene comonomers, there have been no reports of preparing high&#8208;performance thermosetting materials and multiblock copolymers within the same polymerization system solely through the selection of cycloolefin monomers. To achieve this objective, a TOMP system has been designed that combines acyclic diene metathesis (ADMET) polymerization of diene comonomers followed by CAMMP with cyclic olefin monomers (dicyclopentadiene DCPD or cyclooctene COE). The selection of different cyclic olefin monomers provided access to degradable cross&#8208;linked thermosets and multiblock copolymers. Notably, this one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step process is highly efficient and requires the addition of only one metathesis catalyst.

         <title>From Donor&#8208;Acceptor Ligands to Smart Coordination Polymers: Cyanothiazole&#8208;Cu(I) Complexes for Multifunctional Electronic Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyanothiazoles, paired with copper(I) iodide, form complexes with luminescent properties. X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed two types of coordination polymers, while spectroscopic, synchrotron, and electric measurements supported by density functional (DFT) calculations studies highlighted their unique electronic features, offering a foundation for future research.








Abstract
Cyanothiazoles, small and quite overlooked molecules, possess remarkable optical properties that can be fine&#8208;tuned through coordination with transition metals. In this study, we investigate a promising application of cyanothiazoles, where their combination with copper(I) iodide forms a new class of complexes exhibiting outstanding optical properties. X&#8208;ray crystallography of copper(I) iodide complexes with isomeric cyanothiazoles revealed key structural features, such as &#960;&#9472;&#960; stacking, hydrogen bonding, and rare halogen&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;chalcogen I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S interactions, enhancing stability and reactivity. Advanced spectroscopy and computational modeling allowed precise identification of spectral signatures in Fourier&#8208;transform infrared (FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and ultraviolet&#8208;visible (UV&#8211;Vis) spectra. Fluorescence studies, along with X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) synchrotron analyses, highlighted their unique thermal and electronic properties, providing a solid foundation for further research in the field.

         <title>Core&#8208;Twisted, Cationic Perylene Diimides; Homochiral Dimerization and Chiroptical Anion Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The installation of two 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazolium heterocycles on the aromatic core of a perylene diimide (PDI) generates a twisted and cationic organic dye. As potent hydrogen bond donors, these groups enable the PDI to self&#8208;assemble into discrete and robust homochiral dimers in solution. Furthermore, the enantioselective recognition of chiral anions is exploited for chiroptical sensing.








Abstract
Core&#8208;twisted perylene diimides (PDIs) are chiral organic dyes that may be exploited for self&#8208;assembled chiroptical materials or for the enantioselective recognition and sensing of chiral substrates. Discrete self&#8208;assembled dimers and host&#8211;guest complexes of core&#8208;twisted perylene diimides are important for furthering our understanding of this supramolecular chemistry, yet they are rare because the twisted perylene core significantly weakens intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions with the PDI's &#960;&#8208;surface. To address this challenge, we have installed hydrogen bond donor groups in the PDI's bay positions, which direct the formation of a robust, co&#8208;facial and homochiral intermolecular PDI dimer. The structure of this discrete dimer is distinct from previous aggregates of non&#8208;planar PDIs that utilize the imide position for hydrogen bonding. We also uncover the potential of core&#8208;twisted, dicationic PDIs for the enantioselective recognition and chiroptical sensing of chiral anions and investigate the basis of this response via chiral complementarity in the discrete host&#8211;guest complex.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gas&#8208;responsive membranes possess tunable pores and surface properties, offering great potential in the field of smart separation. This review provides a detailed overview of their fabrication methods and applications in separation, along with our perspectives on current challenges and future prospects.








Abstract
Membrane separation technology is one of the most important techniques in modern separation science. To understand the self&#8208;regulation mechanisms of cell membranes and mimic their working principles, a plethora of artificial membranes with responsive abilities to external stimuli have been engineered and prepared, whose smart sieving functions continue to attract attention and are applied in various fields. Among all the known stimuli, gas as a new trigger mode exhibits certain biocompatibility and offer irreplaceable advantages compared to other stimuli, such as cleanliness, ease&#8208;of&#8208;handling, and nondestructive, which make gas&#8208;responsive membranes as one of the most promising, smart separation materials. In this review, we summarize recent breakthroughs in the development of gas&#8208;responsive membranes, outline the novel strategies on membrane fabrication, and highlight their advanced applications in controlled cargo release, size&#8208;/charge&#8208;based substance separation, oil&#8208;water separation, and self&#8208;cleaning. We also outlook the perspectives on the potential research directions and opportunities in the future.

         <title>In Situ Real&#8208;Time Imaging of Benzyl&#8208;Naphthalimide Dyes Revealing Diverse Structural Evolution Dynamics at the Single&#8208;Assembly Level</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ real&#8208;time imaging of the dynamic growth and network formation of benzyl&#8208;naphthalimide dye assemblies were performed through confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and their different growth modes were resolved. These results elucidate distinct structure and assembly dynamics of the three assemblies. This highlights the unique advantages of confocal microscopy in investigating assembly processes and kinetic analysis.








Abstract
Fluorescence imaging has emerged as a powerful technique for in situ monitoring of self&#8208;assembly dynamics providing critical insights into structural evolution and functional potential. However, the inherent complexity of supramolecular systems presents significant challenges for real&#8208;time visualization, particularly in capturing the growth kinetics of individual assemblies and the hierarchical formation of network structures at the single&#8208;assembly level. Here, we visualized the dynamic growth and network formation of benzyl&#8208;naphthalimide dye assemblies in situ by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). In situ time&#8208;lapse imaging revealed distinct dynamic growth mechanisms among the three assemblies. Theoretical calculations demonstrated that different amino substituents significantly influenced assembly morphologies by modulating the planarity of the naphthalene ring. Furthermore, fluorescence lifetime imaging revealed pronounced intra&#8208;assembly heterogeneity, highlighting diverse molecular packing arrangements within individual assemblies. The confocal in situ visualization technique provided single&#8208;assembly growth dynamics, offering insights unattainable through conventional spectroscopic methods. Our work reveals that naphthalimide&#8208;based molecules can self&#8208;assemble into a variety of distinct architectures, underscoring their potential for designing advanced functional materials with tunable properties.

         <title>Aqueous Catalytic Olefin Polymerization With Nickel and Palladium Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Replacing organic media with water in polymerization reactions could yield considerable economic benefits. This review focuses on Ni(II) and Pd(II) catalysts utilized for aqueous catalytic polymerization of olefins, as well as various types of polyolefins fabricated. Key aspects encompass designs of catalysts, polymerization systems, monomers, and material microstructures. The preparation of ultra&#8208;high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) nanocrystals and the modulation of polymer morphology are highlighted.








Abstract
Polyolefins are extensively used in modern society, with hydrocarbon organic compounds traditionally serving as solvents for their preparation. Water, as a reaction medium, offers significant advantages, including non&#8208;flammability, non&#8208;toxicity, high specific heat capacity, and strong polarity. A promising avenue of research involves replacing organic media with water in polymerization reactions, which could yield considerable economic benefits. Among the various transition metal catalysts used to synthesize polyolefins, late&#8208;transition metal catalysts, such as Ni(II) and Pd(II) catalysts, demonstrate enhanced tolerance to polar groups, making them particularly suitable for aqueous polymerization of olefins. This review focuses on the Ni(II) and Pd(II) catalysts utilized for the aqueous catalytic polymerization of olefins, as well as various types of polyolefins fabricated. Key aspects encompass designs of catalysts, polymerization systems, monomers, and material microstructures. The preparation of ultra&#8208;high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) nanocrystals and the modulation of polymer morphology are highlighted. The possible development trend of aqueous catalytic polymerization is envisioned to achieve the development concept of environmental protection and the needs of industrial production.

         <title>Protonation&#8208;Induced Reversible Switching of Electronic Delocalization in a Linear Ru&#8211;Ru&#8211;Ru Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a molecular switch based on protonation&#8208;induced electron transfer reactions, in which electron configuration of 13+ can be switched between LRuII+0.5&#8208;NC&#8208;RuII&#8208;CN&#8208;RuII+0.5L and HLRuII&#8208;NC&#8208;RuIII&#8208;CN&#8208; RuIILH.








Abstract
In this work, we report the first example of a molecular switch between electronic delocalization and electronic localization in cyanidometal&#8208;bridged trinuclear mixed&#8208;valence (MV) complex controlled by a protonation reaction. A MV complex with the terminal 2,3&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)pyridine (L) ligand which has a higher proton&#8208;accepting character, LRuIII&#8208;NC&#8208;RuII&#8208;CN&#8208;RuIIL (13+) was synthesized and well characterized. The investigations indicate that the interaction between the two terminal Ru centers of 13+ is so strong that it is fully delocalized and can be described as LRuII+0.5&#8208;NC&#8208;RuII&#8208;CN&#8208;RuII+0.5L. Most interestingly, 13+ can be reversibly protonated to 13+&#8208;2H coupled with an electron transfer from the central RuII to the terminal RuIII, resulting in a change in electronic structure from LRuII+0.5&#8208;NC&#8208;RuII&#8208;CN&#8208;RuII+0.5L to HLRuII&#8208;NC&#8208;RuIII&#8208;CN&#8208;RuIILH. Cyclic voltammogram of 13+&#8208;2H showed very weak interaction between the two terminal Ru centers. The remarkable change in electronic states by protonation&#8208;induced electron transfer is also strongly supported by the (TD)DFT calculations. Complex 13+ may be potential for an excellent candidate of molecular switch.

         <title>Biodegradable Gel Blends with Enhanced Sensing Capabilities: SIO&#8322;&#8208;Based Innovations for Sustainable and Eco&#8208;Friendly Packaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biodegradable gelatin&#8208;based gel blends reinforced with SiO&#8322; and nanoclay exhibit enhanced mechanical strength, thermal stability, and ion&#8208;mediated structural integrity. These metal&#8208;free, eco&#8208;friendly materials open new opportunities for sustainable packaging.








Abstract
Biopolymer blends (GGs) derived from renewable plant or animal&#8208;based raw materials, hold significant potential for competing in the packaging industry by offering environmentally biodegradable and bioresorbable alternatives. One of the main challenges lies in optimizing the mechanical properties to enhance stress transfer between active additives and the gelatin matrices reinforced with modified SiO&#8322; compounds. In this study, a 5 &#176;C increase in the glass transition temperature and a fourfold improvement in tensile strength (reaching 12&#160;MPa) were achieved by incorporating hydrophilic SiO&#8322; nanoclay. Ion distribution maps visualized the interactions between silicon derivatives and polypeptide domains within the gel matrix, revealing increased stability attributed to ions such as Si+, SiO+, SiH+, and SiHO+. The absence of heavy metals in the blends underscores their potential as environmentally friendly and sustainable packaging solutions, with promising applications in sectors such as medical packaging.

         <title>Synthesis and Aggregation of Amphiphilic Porphyrin&#8208;Perylenebisimide Dyads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the synthesis and characterization of water&#8208;soluble porphyrin&#8208;perylenebisimide dyads with varying sterically demanding side groups. The dyads strongly assemble in basic aqueous solutions, resulting in fully quenched fluorescence. Tracking the individualization through tetrahydrofuran (THF) by UV/Vis spectroscopy revealed stronger porphyrin&#8208;porphyrin interactions for meso&#8208;free dyads. STEM and DLS measurements supported by DFT models reveal micellular structures, as well as larger liposomes and agglomerates.








Abstract
We report the straightforward synthesis of a family of amphiphilic zinc&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;perylenebisimide (PBI) dyads containing sterically demanding substituents at the porphyrin meso&#8208;position, as well as at the PBI bay&#8208;position. The hydrophilic head group consists of oligo&#8208;carboxylic acid G2&#8208;Newkome dendrons attached to the porphyrin, whereas lipophilic pentyl&#8208;hexyl&#8208;swallowtails are connected to the PBI imide position. Using UV/Vis absorption and fluorescence emission spectroscopy, their tetrahydrofuran (THF) initiated disaggregation was studied in aqueous media. Without meso&#8208;substituents, a stronger interaction between the porphyrins was observed in the aggregated state. Insights into the size and morphology of the aggregates were obtained by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, these revealed micelles and liposomes as plausible architectures.

         <title>A Reprocessable Dynamic Disulfide Hydrogel for Capacitive Pressure Sensors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the facile fabrication of a recyclable dynamic disulfide hydrogel of an amphiphilic polyethylene glycol&#8208;based thioctic acid derivative. The elastic hydrogel demonstrates decent mechanical properties and reprocessing capability. A microstructured capacitive sensor incorporating the hydrogel exhibits a decent sensitivity up to 1.14&#160;kPa&#8722;1, a fast response time within 20&#160;ms, and a robust stability.








Abstract
With the rapidly growing demand for wearable sensor devices across a range of applications, sensing technology has been rapidly advancing. However, challenges such as limited sensitivity, device instability, and trade&#8208;offs between performance and recyclability remain unaddressed. We report the facile fabrication of a recyclable dynamic disulfide hydrogel from an amphiphilic polyethylene&#8208;glycol&#8208;based thioctic acid derivative with hydrophilic/hydrophobic characteristics. The hydrogel demonstrates decent thermal stability and adequate mechanical properties, including elasticity, compressibility, and reprocessing capability. It is also integrated into a microstructured capacitive sensor, demonstrating a sensitivity of up to 1.14&#160;kPa&#8722;1, rapid response times within 20&#160;ms, and robust functioning stability up to 400 consecutive cycles. These properties make it particularly intriguing for the sustainable development of high&#8208;performance wearable sensors.

&lt;p&gt;With the rapidly growing demand for wearable sensor devices across a range of applications, sensing technology has been rapidly advancing. However, challenges such as limited sensitivity, device instability, and trade-offs between performance and recyclability remain unaddressed. We report the facile fabrication of a recyclable dynamic disulfide hydrogel from an amphiphilic polyethylene-glycol-based thioctic acid derivative with hydrophilic/hydrophobic characteristics. The hydrogel demonstrates decent thermal stability and adequate mechanical properties, including elasticity, compressibility, and reprocessing capability. It is also integrated into a microstructured capacitive sensor, demonstrating a sensitivity of up to 1.14&#160;kPa&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, rapid response times within 20&#160;ms, and robust functioning stability up to 400 consecutive cycles. These properties make it particularly intriguing for the sustainable development of high-performance wearable sensors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Development of a Highly Selective Synthesis of 4&#8208;Substituted Tetrahydroquinolines: Substrate Scope and Mechanistic Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and selective deprotonation capture sequence of tetrahydroquinolines with alkyl halides and aromatic halides at the 4&#8208;position using organolithiums and phosphoramide ligands is described. Mechanistic and site&#8208;selectivity investigations revealed the active metalation species to be a separated ion pair of which allowed for common directing groups within the heterocyclic scaffold to be bypassed.







Abstract
Herein, we describe a general and selective deprotonation functionalization reaction of tetrahydroquinolines at the 4&#8208;position using organolithiums and phosphoramide ligands. In addition to the development of a direct deprotonation alkylation reaction with primary and secondary alkyl halides, a Negishi cross&#8208;coupling protocol was realized to afford products with a range of aromatic halides. These methods were applied to the late&#8208;stage installation of tetrahydroquinolines into a variety of substrates including pharmaceuticals as well as natural product analogues. The use of thorough mechanistic investigations revealed the aggregation state of the newly formed tetrahydroquinoline anion to be a separated ion pair, which proved critical to optimizing the reaction conditions.

An elegant method described for the construction of fused pyrrole rings via palladium&#8208;catalyzed reactions of aryl iodides 10 with acetylenic substrates 8/9, leading to a general synthesis of benzofuro[3,2&#8208;b]pyrroles 1 and pyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]indoles 2 through 11/12.

Abstract
We report an elegant method for the construction of fused pyrrole rings via palladium&#8208;catalyzed reactions of aryl iodides with N&#8208;prop&#8208;2&#8208;ynylated 3&#8208;aminobenzofurans/3&#8208;aminoindoles leading to the general synthesis of benzofuro[3,2&#8208;b]pyrroles/pyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]indoles via 3&#8208;(arylidene)&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro intermediates. Exposing the intermediates to 2,3&#8208;Dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ) delivered benzofuro[3,2&#8208;b]indoles (BFIs) and indolo[3,2&#8208;b]indoles (IIs) containing vicinal cyano groups. These transformations constitute a rapid intermolecular assembly through several carbon&#160;&#8722;&#160;carbon bond forming reactions, involving a single electron transfer (SET) process in the crucial steps. Photophysical studies of selected products identified promising candidates for future applications.

         <title>Exploring the Modulation of the Complex Folding Landscape of Human Telomeric DNA by a Low Molecular Weight Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Time&#8208;resolved nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy were utilized to investigate the complex G&#8208;quadruplex folding landscape of the human telomeric DNA in the presence of the ligand Phen&#8208;DC3. Our findings revealed significant differences in the kinetics of the pathways originating from the unfolded or K+&#8208;bound state.








Abstract
Telomeric DNA forms G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) structures. These G4 structures are crucial for genomic stability and therapeutic targeting. Using time&#8208;resolved NMR and CD spectroscopy, we investigated how the ligand Phen&#8208;DC3 modulates the folding of the human telomeric repeat 23TAG DNA. The kinetics are modulated by the ligand and by the presence of potassium cations (K+). Ligand binding to G4 occurs via a triphasic process with fast and slow phases. Notably, for the G4 structure in the presence of K+, the slow rate is ten times slower than without K+. These findings offer key insights into the modulation of the complex folding landscape of G4s by ligands, advancing our understanding of G4&#8208;ligand interactions for potential therapeutic applications.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic synthesis uniquely provides opportunities to access molecules that serve defined purposes. Medicinal chemistry illustrates this attribute well with prodrug design, whereby a drug undergoes a late&#8208;stage conversion to a conditionally responsive active medicinal agent (AMA), being a notable example. Prodrugs are becoming increasingly important in medicinal chemistry but common approaches to introduce biologically responsive groups are limited in the chemoselectivity and scope of available functionalization reactions. This Concept article describes strategy&#8208;level prodrug synthesis, which is a powerful extension of classical prodrug formation that initiates sequences with the objective of introducing functionality early in a sequence to achieve greater scope, site&#8208;selectivity, and chemoselectivity for the incorporation of the biologically responsive group. Examples of functionalization using alkyne hydroaminations, Curtius reaction, and alkene metathesis are highlighted along with the use of the prodrugs for biological applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Late&#8208;stage Intermolecular O&#8208;Peptidylation Protocol Enabled by Sequential Acyl Transfer on Thiol&#8208;incorporated Threonine Followed by Desulfurization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The thiol functionality on the methyl group of a threonine derivative [Thr(SH)] facilitates O&#8208;acylation of the Thr hydroxy group with a thioester. We previously showed that a Thr(SH)&#8208;incorporated peptide thioester can be converted to the corresponding Thr&#8208;containing cyclic depsipeptide through intramolecular thioester exchange (S&#8722;S acyl transfer) and subsequent desulfurization of the O&#8208;acyl peptide resulting from intramolecular S&#8722;O acyl transfer. Based on our success in depsipeptide synthesis, we applied the Thr(SH)&#8208;facilitated protocol to the synthesis of branched O&#8208;acyl isopeptides. Initial attempts identified two issues. First, the S&#8208;acylation step with a thioester proceeds in an entropically preferential manner in cyclic depsipeptide synthesis, but not in the case of branched isopeptides. Using a highly volatile thiol component in the thioester solved this issue. Second, the intermolecular thioester change step was accompanied by the formation of an S,O&#8208;diacyl intermediate as a major component; this issue was solved by using thioester&#8208;selective activation of the diacyl species with silver(I) salt followed by desulfurization. Ultimately, the optimized Thr(SH)&#8208;mediated protocol facilitated the late&#8208;stage O&#8208;acylation of a Thr residue in peptide sequences. We show that the protocol has wide substrate scope and demonstrate its application to ubiquitination of the Thr residue of HOIL&#8208;1 peptide.</dc:description>

         <title>The Evolution of Fluorescein into a Potential Theranostic Tool</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent advances in drug discovery and development have been marked by the emergence of new modalities, including small molecule theranostic agents. While initial results from clinical trials have been promising, modern detectable inhibitors are still in an early stage of development. In this study, we present a strategy for chemically evolving a fluorescent imaging agent into a potent therapeutic entity, which not only retains its properties but also enhances its inhibition and detection applicability. By utilizing 15&#8208;LOX&#8208;1 as a model system, we leverage prior knowledge of its inhibitors to rationally functionalize fluorescein, enabling the targeted and highly efficient synthesis of over 20 derivatives across four different scaffolds. This approach ultimately led to the development of a potent, cell&#8208;permeable inhibitor that effectively engages its target in live cells and enables real&#8208;time visualization. These findings validate our new strategy for the development of small molecule diagnostic modulators, paving the way for application in other targets as well.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Enabled Pathway Complexity in Supramolecular Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pathway complexity in supramolecular assemblies presents a unique opportunity for a single, relatively simple system to exhibit a wide range of properties, allowing for multifunctionality. In this study, we report redox&#8208;enabled pathway complexity in amino acid&#8208; functionalized perylene diimides (PDIs) and its consequence for the macroscopic hydrogel network. We show that chemical reduction and subsequent oxidation enable a kinetically trapped state which transforms into different network morphologies in response to heat and time. Our finding that pathway complexity in supramolecular systems can alter bulk material properties suggests the potential for future development of dynamic materials that achieve multiple macroscopic functions with a single building block.</dc:description>

         <title>Entropy&#8208;production type Prussian Blue Analogues: a family of promising hosts for high&#8208;performance multivalent&#8208;ion batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The advancement of high&#8208;performance, safe, and cost&#8208;effective multivalent&#8208;ion batteries is pivotal for sustainable energy storage. Prussian blue analogs (PBAs), with their open framework and tunable redox&#8208;active sites, hold significant promise but face challenges in structural instability and sluggish ion diffusion. This review focuses on entropy production PBAs (EP&#8208;PBAs) for non&#8208;monovalent ion (Zn2+, Al3+, Mg2+, Ca2+) battery systems. Incorporating multiple transition metals into PBAs leverages entropy production effects to stabilize crystal structures, enhance ion diffusion kinetics, and improve cycling stability. Synthesis methods such as co&#8208;precipitation, electrochemical deposition, and hydrothermal techniques are compared, with co&#8208;precipitation emerging as the most scalable approach. Entropy engineering mitigates lattice distortion, reduces defects, and suppresses phase transitions, enabling EP&#8208;PBAs to achieve high specific capacities and long&#8208;term stability. Challenges including interfacial instability and synthesis complexity are discussed, alongside future directions in material optimization, electrolyte compatibility, and scalable production. This work highlights the potential of entropy&#8208;stabilized PBAs as next&#8208;generation cathodes for multivalent&#8208;ion batteries, advancing sustainable energy storage technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>2D MOF Nanozyme&#8208;Enhanced Impedance Detector for Synergistic Biofilm Detection and Removal in Bioelectrochemical Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation of biofilm has become a significant influencing factor to microbial fuel cells (MFCs). Developing effective biofilm detection means are highly imperative for improving the efficiency of MFCs. In this study, we propose a two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;organic framework (2D Cu&#8208;BDC) nanozyme&#8208;based impedance detector for the simultaneous detection and removal of bacterial biofilms. The promising induction interface features good electron transfer and biofilm attachment properties, realizing sensitive biofilm detection. The impedance response change on the functionalized 2D MOF detector was 3.5 times higher for Gram&#8208;positive bacteria biofilm and 2.7 times higher for Gram&#8208;negative bacteria biofilm compared to bare electrodes. In addition, the 2D MOF nanozyme demonstrates robust peroxidase&#8208;like activity, enabling efficient biofilm degradation at low H2O2 concentration, and further allowing for real&#8208;time monitoring of the biofilm elimination process. This study provides a novel approach to using MOF&#8208;based biosensors for the simultaneous detection and removal of biofilm in MFCs.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of Asparagine as a Gatekeeper Residue in the Selective Binding of Rare Earth Elements by Lanthanide&#8208;Binding Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lanthanide&#8208;binding tag (LBT) peptides selectively complex lanthanide cations (Ln3+) in their binding pockets and are promising for lanthanide separation. However, designing LBTs that selectively target specific Ln3+ cations remains a challenge due to limited molecular&#8208;level understanding and control of interactions within the lanthanide&#8208;binding pocket. Here, we reveal that the N5 asparagine residue acts as a gatekeeper in the binding pocket, resulting in a 100&#8208;fold selectivity for smaller Lu3+ over larger La3+ cations. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations show that the N5 residue &#160;weakly binds to the larger La3+ cation, permitting H2O molecules inside the pocket. For the smaller Lu3+ cations, the N5 forms an inter&#8208;arm hydrogen bond with the E14 glutamic acid residue, locking the Lu3+ cation in the pocket and preventing H2O infiltration. Mutating the N5 asparagine to a D5 aspartic acid prevents such a hydrogen bond, eliminates the gatekeeping mechanism and precipitously reduces selectivity. The resulting binding affinity to Ln3+ cations is non&#8208;monotonic but generally increases with cation size. These results suggest a molecular design paradigm: the reduced affinity for larger lanthanides is due to open pocket conformations, while the selectivity of smaller Ln3+ cations over larger ones is due to the gatekeeping hydrogen bond.</dc:description>

         <title>An Asymmetric Reductive Amination Synthesis of Ritlecitinib Using (S)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Methylbenzylamine as Chiral Auxiliary</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a new synthesis of ritlecitinib, employing asymmetric reductive amination via a chiral auxiliary group, combined with intramolecular amide formation. This method employs a Ti(OEt)4/NaBH4 reductive system to achieve a one&#8208;pot condensation&#8208;reduction of the ketone&#8208;amino acid derivative with (S)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;methylbenzylamine, resulting in an 85% yield of the di&#8208;amino acid derivative with a diastereomeric ratio of 86:14. The incorporation of a chiral auxiliary substantially enhances the diastereopurity. Subsequently, acetic acid&#8208;mediated cyclization then forms the &#948;&#8208;lactam in 60% yield. This lactam is converted to ritlecitinib via a five&#8208;step sequence in 62% overall yield. This approach effectively circumvents the use of precious metal catalysts or hazardous reagents for constructing the chiral piperidine moiety, which were essential components in prior synthetic route.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkyl&#8208;&#960; Liquids as Condensed&#8208;State Singlet Oxygen Photosensitisers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functional materials capable of generating singlet oxygen (1O2), a highly reactive but short&#8208;lived species used to destroy organic materials, including chemical pollutants and biological entities, typically incorporate a chromophore that acts as a photosensitiser into a tertiary scaffold. Current functional materials that produce 1O2 include metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs), polymeric nanoparticles, modified glasses, and supramolecular assemblies. Whilst multi&#8208;component functional materials have been widely reported, producing functional materials using a single small molecule in a condensed state has hardly been reported. Herein, we report the first use of functional molecular liquids (alkyl&#8208;&#960; liquids), non&#8208;volatile singlecomponent condensed&#8208;state fluidic materials, as photosensitisers for the generation of 1O2 at an alkyl&#8208;&#960; liquidwater interface.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Functional materials capable of generating singlet oxygen (1O2), a highly reactive but short-lived species used to destroy organic materials, including chemical pollutants and biological entities, typically incorporate a chromophore that acts as a photosensitiser into a tertiary scaffold. Current functional materials that produce 1O2 include metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent-organic frameworks (COFs), polymeric nanoparticles, modified glasses, and supramolecular assemblies. Whilst multi-component functional materials have been widely reported, producing functional materials using a single small molecule in a condensed state has hardly been reported. Herein, we report the first use of functional molecular liquids (alkyl-&#960; liquids), non-volatile singlecomponent condensed-state fluidic materials, as photosensitisers for the generation of 1O2 at an alkyl-&#960; liquidwater interface. We investigate the incorporation of various chromophores into alkyl-&#960; liquids that are suitable for 1O2 production and analyse the molecular structure required to produce efficient alkyl-&#960; liquid photosensitisers. The alkyl-&#960; liquids were studied, impregnated into porous membranes, and as thin films on quartz and Si wafers, the limitations of 1O2 production were investigated.

         <dc:description>The reaction of [2,6&#8208;(DippN=CH)2C6H3]Bi (1Dipp, Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPrC6H3) with CH2I2 proceeded via double C&#8208;I bond activation yielding [2,6&#8208;(DippN=CH)2C6H3]Bi(&#956;&#8208;(Bi,N)&#8208;CH2)I2 (3). By contrast, the reaction of 1Dipp with 1,2&#8208;diiodoethane provided [2,6&#8208;(DippN=CH)2C6H3]BiI2 (1DippI2) and ethene. The tert&#8208;butyl analogue [2,6&#8208;(tBuN=CH)2C6H3]Bi (1tBu) reacted with CH2ClX to give [2,6&#8208;(tBuN=CH)2C6H3]Bi(CH2Cl)X (X = I (4) or Cl (5)). Further, its reactivity with CH2I2 was sensitive towards the stoichiometry since using a 1:1 ratio gave a mixture of dinuclear complex {[2,6&#8208;(tBuN=CH)2C6H3]Bi(I)}2(&#956;&#8208;(Bi,Bi)&#8208;CH2) (6) and [2,6&#8208;(tBuN=CH)2C6H3]Bi(CH2I)I (7). The reaction could be shifted in favor of 7 using an excess of CH2I2, but with 0.45 eq. of CH2I2 compound 6, as a product of double C&#8208;I bond activation mediated by two Bi atoms was isolated as the main product.</dc:description>

         <title>Ir/Ni Metallaphotoredox Catalysis for the C(sp3)&#8211;H Bond &#945;&#8208;Arylation and Alkylation of N&#8208;Alkyl N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we report a regioselective C(sp3)&#8211;H bond &#945;&#8208;arylation and alkylation of N&#8208;alkyl heterocycles (carbazoles, indoles and indazoles) using a Ir/Ni metallaphotoredox catalysis. This approach enables the direct functionalization of unactivated C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds at the &#945;&#8208;position of nitrogen heterocycles, offering an efficient alternative to traditional Sn2 methods and providing complementary regioselectivity to transition metal catalysis, which often results in C(sp2)&#8211;H bond arylation. The reaction employs [Ir(dF(CF3)ppy)2(dtbbpy)][PF6] as the photocatalyst and NiCl2(dtbbpy) as the nickel source, facilitating single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) to promote radical generation and organometallic elementary cross&#8208;coupling steps. The methodology allows the use of diverse aryl chlorides and alkenes, demonstrating broad substrate scope and high functional group tolerance. Mechanistic investigations, including radical trapping and and Stern&#8208;Volmer experiments, support a photocatalytic radical pathway. This new metallaphotoredox protocol presents a robust and atom&#8208;economical route to synthesizing valuable N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;N&#8208;aryl heterocycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailored Self&#8208;assembled Biomimetic Nanofibers for Light&#8208;Driven &#946;&#8208;lactam Antibiotics Degradation in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The overuse of antibiotics in China and the resulting rise in antibiotic resistance pose an urgent need for effective antibiotic degradation in water. Developing artificial systems that mimic the catalytic efficiency of natural photoactive enzymes for this purpose remains a critical challenge. Despite decades of research, there is a notable scarcity of precisely designed scaffolds that can replicate the structural and functional efficiency of natural enzymes for waterborne antibiotic degradation, particularly at the nano&#8208; to micrometer scale. In this study, we present a core&#8208;corona type fiber&#8208;like micellar system designed for photothermal&#8208;assisted &#946;&#8208;lactam antibiotic degradation (PAD) in water. This system integrates photothermal molecular chromophores (zinc porphyrin) and ionic copper degradation catalysts in close proximity within grafted solvophilic coronal chains on the surface of fiber&#8208;like crystalline scaffold. By employing a living crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA) strategy, we fine&#8208;tune the composition, dimensions, and antibiotic degradation performance of the PAD nanofibers. The tailored colloidal stable PAD nanofibers achieve a penicillin G degradation rate of 0.35 min&#8208;1 per micromole of copper under simulated sunlight irradiation (A.M. 1.5) in deionized water, offering a promising platform for sustainable environmental remediation.</dc:description>

         <title>Triflic Anhydride&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Anthraquinones and Anthrones via Unusual Intramolecular Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triflic anhydride (Tf2O) is a potent electrophilic activator for carbonyl groups, facilitating the formation of versatile triflate intermediates that undergo nucleophilic trapping to generate a broad array of valuable compounds. In this work, we have developed a novel method that utilizes Tf2O as a mediator for carbonyl activation and subsequent intramolecular rearrangement of 3,3&#8208;diarylbenzofuranones into anthraquinones 2 and anthrones 3. Both anthraquinones and anthrones are important molecules in the fields of natural products research, pharmaceuticals, and traditional chinese medicines. A plausible reaction mechanism is proposed involving Tf2O&#8208;mediated activation, carbocation formation, nucleophilic addition, and intramolecular cyclization, ultimately leading to the formation of anthraquinones and anthrones. The developed methodology is both operationally simple and convenient, without the need for an inert atmosphere. This study broadens the scope of Tf2O utility and extends the practical application of intriguing intramolecular rearrangement to the synthesis of biologically active compounds, pharmaceuticals and functional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances In The Fixation of CO2 to form N&#8208;containing Heterocyclic Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds are common chemical structures in drugs, bioactive compounds, and natural products. Using CO2 as a C1 source for synthesizing N&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds aligns with the concepts of green chemistry and sustainability. In recent years, the synthesis of N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds has been extensively and intensively studied. However, significant challenges remain, such as thermodynamic limitations, low catalytic efficiency, and harsh reaction conditions. Catalysts play an essential role in the catalytic activation of CO2 and/or substrates, thereby facilitating CO2 conversion. This review provides an overview of several typical N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds converted from CO2, such as oxazolidinones, quinazoline&#8208;2,4(1H,3H)&#8208;diones, benzimidazoles, and benzimidazolones. The most recent catalysts used in these reactions are discussed, emphasizing their mechanistic roles in the reaction process.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Prussian Blue Analogs via a Solid&#8208;Solution Storage Mechanism for Long&#160;Cycle Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries Cathodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The open&#8208;framework characteristics of Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) have been recognized as advantages for cathode application in Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Nevertheless, lattice distortions during charge&#8208;discharge cycles critically compromise their cyclability. Recent advancements in high&#8208;entropy design strategies have significantly improved structural stability and energy storage efficiency within functional materials. In this study, we developed the high&#8208;entropy PBAs, K1.68Mn0.21Cu0.20Ni0.20Co0.19Fe0.20[Fe(CN)6]0.87&#9633;0.13&#183;0.66H2O, via a cost&#8208;effective aqueous coprecipitation protocol. Notably, this approach facilitates&#160;the concurrent incorporation of five transition metals (Mn, Cu, Ni, Co, and Fe), thereby establishing a stable crystalline framework. Electrochemical characterization demonstrates&#160;that the cathode achieves a specific capacity of 124.9 mAh g&#8722;1&#160;at 0.025 A g&#8722;1. At various current densities (0.025&#8208;1 A g&#8722;1), the cathode maintains&#160;a particular capacity retention&#160;of 62.1% during rate testing. Furthermore, the cathode exhibits&#160;exceptional cyclability, preserving 78.7% capacity at 1 A g&#8722;1&#160;after 3000 cycles. Operando&#160;X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirms&#160;the formation of a reversible solid&#8208;solution intercalation/extraction mechanism process, which prevents phase transitions and enhances cyclability. This high&#8208;entropy material holds significant potential as a cathode for SIBs, offering high specific capacity and outstanding long&#8208;term cycling stability. These superior properties position it as a competitive candidate for advanced energy storage systems.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The open-framework characteristics of Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) have been recognized as advantages for cathode application in Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Nevertheless, lattice distortions during charge-discharge cycles critically compromise their cyclability. Recent advancements in high-entropy design strategies have significantly improved structural stability and energy storage efficiency within functional materials. In this study, we developed the high-entropy PBAs, K1.68Mn0.21Cu0.20Ni0.20Co0.19Fe0.20[Fe(CN)6]0.87&#9633;0.13&#183;0.66H2O, via a cost-effective aqueous coprecipitation protocol.

         <title>Peripheral Designed Indigo Bola&#8208;Amphiphiles for Supramolecular Assembled Nanoarchitectonics in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Indigo, an ancient natural dye, featured excellent biodegradability to advance in sustainable polymer. Indigo amphiphiles can pave a way for sustainable supramolecular polymers in aqueous media for potential biomedical functional materials. However, contemporary indigo amphiphiles supramolecular commonly assemble into low aspect ratio nanostructures, which hampers the macroscopic soft scaffolds fabrications and smart functional material applications. Herein, we report a novel peripheral designed indigo bola&#8208;amphiphiles (IBAs), which assemble into high aspect ratio supramolecular nanofibers in aqueous media. By employing shear&#8208;flow assembly technique with bio&#8208;abundant calcium ions, IBAs assemble across multiple length&#8208;scales into supramolecular macroscopic scaffolds. The structural characterizations of IBAs macroscopic soft scaffolds show different supramolecular structural packing information by scanning electron microscope and X&#8208;ray scattering/diffraction techniques. Our supramolecular nanoarchitectonic approach indicates the feasibility of using IBAs molecular design to construct supramolecular macroscopic materials with higher structural order for the future smart bio&#8208;functional materials and sustainable supramolecular polymer under more environmentally friendly conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Stannylenes Bearing an Amino&#8208;Linked NHC Ligand as Efficient Catalysts for Hydroboration of Carbonyls and Imines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We designed and synthesized a series of three&#8208;coordinated stannylenes featuring an amino&#8208;linked NHC ligand, specifically tailored for the hydroboration of carbonyl compounds and imines. To fine&#8208;tune the catalytic performance both sterically and electronically, various substituents (chloro, triflate, and bis(trimethylsilyl)amino groups) were introduced at the tin center, generating structurally diverse stannylenes. The hydroboration of carbonyl compounds catalyzed by these stannylenes proceeded under mild reaction conditions, affording the corresponding boryl esters in excellent yields with high chemoselectivity. Notably, bis(trimethylsilyl)aminostannylene exhibited outstanding catalytic efficiency, enabling hydroboration with a minimal catalyst loading of 0.01 mol% for aldehydes and 0.1 mol% for ketones, and was tolerant of a wide range of substrates, including sterically hindered and electronically diverse carbonyl compounds.&#12288;Furthermore, in the hydroboration of imines, the reaction proceeded efficiently with just 5 mol% catalyst, furnishing the corresponding borylamines in high yields. Based on stoichiometric experiments, we propose a plausible catalytic cycle for stannylene&#8208;mediated hydroboration.</dc:description>

In particular, we report direct experimental determination of the effective g&#8208;values and zero field splittings of the energetically low&#8208;lying Kramers doublets. Our quantitative determination of the magnetic anisotropy highlights the relevance of an axial g&#8208;tensor for SMM behaviour and suggests that fast magnetic relaxation is mainly driven by a thermally assisted quantum tunnelling process via low&#8208;lying excited states.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A daisy chain architecture without a preferred low energy arrangement of the mechanically linked components is presented. The molecular design combines a rigid&#8208;rod type oligophenylene ethynylene subunit with an oligoethylene glycol macrocycle that features a bipyridine coordination site. The daisy chain dimer was synthesized via kinetic trapping of the interlocked structure using a Cadiot&#8208;Chodkiewicz active metal template reaction. Comparison of the isolated interlocked dimer with its monomeric analogue indicates the presence of a variety of different geometries for the molecular daisy chain. The dynamic sliding motion in the daisy chain is studied by variable temperature UV&#8208;vis and NMR spectroscopy experiments, which point to a highly mobile system even at low temperatures.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have experienced a concerning global increase in incidence over recent decades. The advent of molecular imaging probes has revolutionized real&#8208;time biomarker monitoring in IBD pathophysiology, enabling visualization of critical pathological processes. These probes provide dynamic insights into oxidative stress mediators (including reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species) and enzymatic biomarkers (e.g., caspase&#8208;1, pantetheinase, dipeptidyl peptidase IV, nitroreductase, elastase, myeloperoxidase, and carboxylesterase 2), which are crucial for understanding disease mechanisms. Despite significant technological advancements, there remains a lack of systematic analyses exploring the diagnostic potential and therapeutic monitoring applications of these molecular probes in IBD management. This review comprehensively analyzes the design of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art molecular probes targeting IBD&#8208;specific biomarkers, with particular focus on their detection mechanisms and biological applicability. Through a mechanistic elucidation of detection paradigms, this review aims to guide the development of future probes for diagnosing IBD.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidative Folding of a Two&#8208;Chain Protein Having Three Interchain Disulfide Bonds. Synthesis of Bromelain Inhibitor VI through Native Chain Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recently renovated two&#8208;chain folding method, in which two native peptide chains without any sidechain protections and interchain scaffolds are just mixed in a buffer solution under optimized conditions, called native chain assembly (NCA), enabled efficient chemical synthesis of &#945;&#8208;helix&#8208;rich insulin and its analogs, which are stabilized by two interchain disulfide (SS) bridges. Herein, this simple folding method has been successfully applied to the folding of a different&#8208;type two&#8208;chain protein, i.e., bromelain inhibitor VI (BI&#8208;VI), which has abundant &#946;&#8208;sheet structures and is stabilized by three interchain SS bridges. When the chemically synthesized native heavy (H)&#8208; and light (L)&#8208;chains of BI&#8208;VI were mixed at 4 &#176;C in a pH 10.0 buffer solution containing 2 mM GSH and 0.4 mM GSSG, native BI&#8208;VI was obtained surprisingly in a high isolated yield (53 %) after 2 weeks. The obtained BI&#8208;VI showed complete inhibitory activity against bromelain, whereas each component chain exhibited essentially non&#8208;activity. The rate&#8208;limiting step of the two&#8208;chain folding was assumed to be the chain coupling between three&#8208;SS intermediates of the H&#8208;chain (3SSH) and one&#8208;SS intermediates of the L&#8208;chain (1SSL). This achievement opens a door to the chemical synthesis of unprecedent multi&#8208;chain proteins with more complicated SS&#8208;bond topologies.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We describe a chiral Rh&#8208;catalyzed [2 + 2 + 2] cycloaddition of 1,8&#8208;naphthylene&#8208;based 1,10&#8208;diynes as an anti/syn mixture with alkynoates. Thermodynamically stable saddle&#8208;shaped chiral cycloadducts were obtained in good to high yield along with good to high enantiomeric ratio. Hetero [2 + 2 + 2] cycloaddition using aryl cyanides also proceeded to give inherently chiral pyridine&#8208;containing compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>The Energetics of Electron Transfer in Redox&#8208;DNA Layers Mimics that of Redox Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Redox&#8208;DNA layers have recently shown unique properties, such as tunable reorganization energy of electron transfer that can be modulated by DNA length or hybridization state, and completely suppressed under nanoconfinement. These discoveries, attributed to the changes in the solvation of the redox marker and/or fast chain dynamics, provide a unique opportunity to use electrochemical measurements as a tool to address open questions in ion solvation. Moreover, they offer a pathway to clarify the origin of the largely unsolved problem of establishing low activation barriers for biological electron transfer. Here, high&#8208;scan&#8208;rate, variable&#8208;temperature cyclic voltammetry, analyzed using the Marcus formalism and molecular dynamics simulations, reveals that the total free energy barrier of electron transfer consists of two additive elements: the reorganization energy of the partially desolvated redox marker and the energy cost for solvation changes of the redox marker at the solid/liquid interface. These results may have profound implications for our understanding of electron transfer and solvation effects in redox proteins, providing opportunities for better design of artificial photosynthetic systems, biosensing, and energy conversion devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Dinitrogen Splitting Without Barrier or Visible Light&#8208;Driven: Reactions of Vanadium Trimers and Dimers with Dinitrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of V atoms and small clusters with dinitrogen has been investigated by matrix&#8208;isolation in solid Ne and by complementary quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. The experiments disclose striking differences between the reactivity of V atoms, dimers, and trimers towards dinitrogen. Whereas V atoms react only by formation of complexes, both V2 and V3 react by cleavage of the N2 triple&#8208;bond to form nitride clusters. Whereas V3 reacts immediately at the conditions of matrix&#8208;deposition, the reaction of V2 requires the activation by visible&#8208;light irradiation. There is evidence for two isomers of V2N2, a planar one with a 5Au electronic term and long V&#8722;V distance and a folded one with a 1A1 term and a short V&#8722;V distance. Furthermore, there are also complexes of V2 and V3 with N2 containing activated N2 units.</dc:description>
