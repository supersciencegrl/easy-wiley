         <title>Zirconium(IV)&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrosilylation of Organic Carbonates and Polycarbonates Household Wastes into Alcohol Derivatives[]
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A variety of organic carbonates have been catalytically reduced by the Schwartz reagent Cp2Zr(H)Cl in presence of the reductant MeSi(OMe)2H to the corresponding sylilated diol derivatives in excellent yield and selectivity. The method can be transposed to the depolymerisation of pure polycarbonates or derived from household wastes. Experimental investigations afforded information on the mechanism at play.







Abstract
The Schwartz's reagent Cp2Zr(H)Cl is a well known stoichiometric reagent for the reduction of unsaturated organic molecules but it has rarely been used in catalytic transformations. Herein, we describe the reduction of a variety of organic carbonates using the catalyst Cp2Zr(H)Cl in combination with Me(MeO)2SiH (DMMS) as reductant. This method was further applied to the reductive depolymerization of some polycarbonate materials and yielded silylated alcohols and diols in mild conditions. This method for the recycling polycarbonates is characterized by its stability to the additives contained in household plastics as well as its ability to selectively depolymerize the polycarbonate PC&#8208;BPA when mixed with the polyester PET. Experimental investigations brought evidences on a mechanism based on the succession of a three steps sequence comprising the hydrozirconation of the carbonyl fragment, thermal &#963; C&#8722;O bond cleavage, and an ultimate Zr&#8722;OR/Si&#8722;H &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis reaction to regenerate the hydride catalyst.

         <title>Ultrafast Photoinduced Electron Transfer Between Donor (Eosin&#8208;Y) and Acceptor (Naphthoquinone) in a Supramolecular Array Based on a Coordination Cage Host</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Outside to inside: a coordination cage with distinct surface&#8208;binding and cavity&#8208;binding sites can bind two different guest types using orthogonal interactions, allowing for photoinduced electron transfer to occur between guests across the cage surface on a 1&#8197;ps timescale.







Abstract
An octanuclear M8L12 coordination cage host (HPEG&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;M) in aqueous solution binds neutral electron&#8208;accepting guests such as naphthoquinone (NQ) in its central cavity via the hydrophobic effect, and multiple anionic photosensitisers such as Eosin&#8208;Y (EY2&#8722;) around the exterior surface due to 16+ charge on the complex cation: this is confirmed by both solution titration experiments and X&#8208;ray crystallography. In the three&#8208;component assembly HPEG&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Cd/EY2&#8722;/NQ, photoexcitation of EY2&#8722; at 525&#8197;nm results in ultrafast (ca. 1&#8197;ps) photoinduced EY2&#8722;&#8594;NQ electron transfer from surface&#8208;bound EY2&#8722; to cavity&#8208;bound NQ (which have been brought into close proximity by their interactions with different sites on the host cage) to give the charge&#8208;separated pair EY&#8901;&#8722;/NQ&#8901;&#8722;, identified by transient absorption spectroscopy: back&#8208;ET results in charge recombination in &#8776;70&#8197;ps. The assembly of donor and acceptor components via orthogonal interactions using the host cage as a scaffold presents a promising route into spatial control of multiple components in supramolecular arrays for photophysical applications.

         <title>Syntheses of Carbazoles by Photosensitized Electrocyclization of Triarylamines. Effect of Inductive Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Groups on the Photocyclization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The acetone&#8208;photosensitized irradiation of mono&#8208; and di&#8208;substituted triarylamines effectively affords the respective carbazoles in high yields. Particularly noticeable are triarylamines substituted with inductive electron withdrawing groups (Cl, CnF2n+1), which afford almost exclusively endo carbazoles. Mechanistic investigations and in&#8208;silico studies rationalize this tendency.







Abstract
The acetone&#8208;sensitized [6&#960;]&#8208;electrocyclization of unsubstituted, mono&#8208;, and disubstituted triarylamines (TAAs: substituents H, CH&#8323;, CH&#8323;O, Cl, CnF&#8322;n+1; n=1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10) under 310&#8197;nm light led to the formation of endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;carbazoles in high yields; particularly, TAAs substituted with inductive electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (Cl, CnF2n+1) exhibit remarkable endo&#8208;selectivity towards cyclization. For TAAs substituted with both inductive electron&#8208; withdrawing and donating groups, the photocyclization towards endo carbazoles is dictated by the presence of the electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. Chemical yields (%), quantum yields of conversion (&#966;R), apparent cyclization rate constants (kcyc), and Hammett plots correlations are illustrated for all substituted TAAs in acetone. Photophysical studies reveal that TAAs substituted with resonance electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (OAc, NO2, CHO) do not undergo electrocyclization in acetone at 310&#8197;nm due to formation of charge&#8208;transfer states that vastly deactivate the triplet reactive manifold, paralleling the behavior observed in MeCN as solvent. Absorption and emission spectra, Stokes shifts, and singlet excited state energies are illustrated for substituted TAAs and carbazoles. In&#8208;silico studies support the high stereoselectivity observed for the preferred endo&#8208; photosensitized [6&#960;]&#8208;electrocyclization of Cl&#8208; and perfluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted TAAs.

         <title>Embedding Coupled Pd/Fe Sites in Electrospun MOF&#8208;Derived Carbon Nanofibers Achieves Efficient and Durable Oxygen Reduction Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Pd&#8722;Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C nanofiber catalyst, synthesized by electrospinning and metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) pyrolysis, features highly dispersed Pd/Fe sites in nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon. The incorporation of Pd enhances structural stability, strong Pd&#8722;Fe interaction reduces overpotential and promotes intermediate conversion. It achieves a 0.953&#8197;V half&#8208;wave potential, with only 1&#8197;mV loss after 10,000&#8197;cycles, demonstrating great oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and stability.







Abstract
High costs, poor durability of Pt electrocatalysts, and the low performance of non&#8208;precious metals hinder the large&#8208;scale commercialization of fuel cells. To address these challenges, a bimetallic, highly dispersed catalyst containing Pd and Fe uniformly distributed on porous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanofibers was developed. This catalyst demonstrated remarkable oxygen reduction catalytic performance. The Pd&#8722;Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst exhibited catalytic activity 4.6 times higher than that of the JM 20&#8201;% Pt/C catalyst, despite containing only 0.62&#8197;wt.&#8201;% Pd. Moreover, it achieved a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2=0.953&#8197;V vs. RHE) that is 40&#8197;mV higher than the JM 20&#8201;% Pt/C catalyst (0.913&#8197;V vs. RHE). Significantly, with a total metal content of just 1.19&#8197;wt.&#8201;%, the E1/2 of Pd&#8722;Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst decreased by only 1&#8197;mV after 10,000&#8197;cycles, highlighting its exceptional durability. Furthermore, a stability test revealed a current retention rate of 84.87&#8201;% after 50,000&#8197;s of operation, with no evidence of agglomeration. These results suggest that combining electrostatic spinning of MOFs with pyrolysis provides an effective and innovative method for synthesizing electrocatalysts with reduced reliance on precious metals.

Moreover, it achieved a half-wave potential (E&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;=0.953&#8197;V vs. RHE) that is 40&#8197;mV higher than the JM 20&#8201;% Pt/C catalyst (0.913&#8197;V vs. RHE). Significantly, with a total metal content of just 1.19&#8197;wt.&#8201;%, the E&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; of Pd&#8722;Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst decreased by only 1&#8197;mV after 10,000&#8197;cycles, highlighting its exceptional durability. Furthermore, a stability test revealed a current retention rate of 84.87&#8201;% after 50,000&#8197;s of operation, with no evidence of agglomeration. These results suggest that combining electrostatic spinning of MOFs with pyrolysis provides an effective and innovative method for synthesizing electrocatalysts with reduced reliance on precious metals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Functional Synthetic Linear and Cyclic Peptides with Anti&#8208;Amyloid and Antimicrobial Activities for Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

This study presented two strategies to aid in the discovery of synthetic peptide inhibitors with anti&#8208;amyloid and antimicrobial activities for Alzheimer's disease. Four synthetic peptides were identified, including the shortest linear peptide and two cyclic peptides with simple structures.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;functional peptides exhibiting both anti&#8208;amyloid and antimicrobial activities have attracted attention as promising candidates for Alzheimer's disease treatment. The advantage of these peptides lies in their ability to simultaneously target both the amyloid cascade hypothesis and the microbial infection hypothesis, in contrast to single&#8208;function inhibitors. However, most of the reported dual&#8208;functional peptides to date are natural peptides, and the development of synthetic peptides in this area remains limited. In this study, we propose two strategies to aid in the discovery of synthetic dual&#8208;functional peptides. We then report four distinct synthetic dual&#8208;functional peptides identified using these strategies, with the A&#946;1&#8211;40/A&#946;1&#8211;42 fibrillation system and common bacterial strains serving as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept platform. One strategy involves repurposing existing knowledge, while the other breaks from established conventions. Using the first strategy, we discovered a very short dual&#8208;functional linear peptide. With the second strategy, we identified a simple dual&#8208;functional cyclic peptide. Furthermore, by combining these two strategies, we developed a hybrid dual&#8208;functional peptide incorporating both linear and cyclic structures. We hope that our findings will contribute to the future discovery of more synthetic dual&#8208;functional peptides for treating Alzheimer's disease.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfur&#8208;rich copolymers, characterized by high sulfur contents and dynamic disulfide bonds, show significant promise as sustainable alternatives to conventional carbon&#8208;based plastics. Since the advent of inverse vulcanization in 2013, numerous synthesis strategies have emerged&#8212;ranging from thermopolymerization and photoinduced polymerization to the use of crosslinkers such as mercaptans, episulfides, benzoxazines, and cyclic disulfides. These advancements coupled with the rising demand for degradable plastics have driven research for diverse applications, including optical windows, metal uptake, and adhesives. Due to the unique electronic properties of sulfur&#8208;rich materials, they are promising candidates for cathodes in Li&#8208;S batteries and triboelectric nanogenerators. This review highlight the latest exciting ways of synthesis strategy in which sulfur and sulfur&#8208;based reactions are bing utilized to produce sustainable materials in energy, optics, engeneering material, environemtal, and triboelectric nanogenerators. Finally, this review provides a forward&#8208;looking perspective on the opportunities and challenges shaping this rapidly evolving field.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Space&#8208;Crowded Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer Molecules for the Fabrication of Efficient Blue OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Currently, the advance of high&#8208;resolution display device puts a high requirement for the development of efficient luminescent materials emitting high&#8208;quality blue light. But stable blue luminescent materials with high electroluminescence (EL) efficiencies and narrow emission spectra are still rare. In this work, two efficient blue molecules (mCPTC and 2mCPTC) are developed by linking large&#8208;volume electron donors of 1,3&#8208;bis(N&#8208;carbazolyl)benzene (mCP) and electron acceptor of 2,4&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (DPTRZ) on the 3,6&#8208;di(tert&#8208;butyl)carbazole holder through benzene bridges. Their thermal stability, crystal and electronic structures, energy levels, photophysical property, charge transport ability and EL behaviors are thoroughly studied. They hold high structural rigidity and through&#8208;space charge transfer characteristics between donor and acceptor, and exhibit strong deep blue photoluminescence. They can not only function as emitters in OLEDs to radiate deep blue light, but also serve as efficient hosts for blue multi&#8208;resonance emitter v&#8208;DABNA, providing narrow EL spectra and excellent EL efficiencies of 24.21%, much higher than those in common host without sensitizers. These results demonstrate the good potentials of these blue molecules in the fabrication of efficient narrow&#8208;spectrum blue OLEDs.</dc:description>

         <title>Isolation of a Rare Terminal Zr(IV) Peroxide and Insight into Polyoxovanadate Support Impact on Thioether Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Substitutional lability of the terminal methoxide ligand on a Zr(IV) substituted polyoxovanadate&#8208;alkoxide (POV&#8208;alkoxide) via protonolysis is presented. Addition of excess water or stoichiometric 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethanol results in the exchange of the terminal methoxide ligand for a hydroxide or 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethoxide ligand, respectively. The lability of the terminal methoxide ligand at zirconium is leveraged to access a relatively stable terminal peroxide bound to a POV&#8208;alkoxide supported Zr(IV) center, via addition of hydrogen peroxide adducts compatible with organic solvent. Isolation of the terminal peroxide complex allows for investigation into the impact of the sterically protected, electron&#8208;rich POV&#8208;alkoxide support on the activation of hydrogen peroxide at Zr(IV). While the isolated peroxide complex is inactive towards the oxidation of thioethers, the methoxy terminated Zr(IV) functions as a precatalyst for the reaction. Mechanistic analysis reveals electrophilic oxidation conditions with hydrogen peroxide substrates, with a nucleophilic parameter of 0.09 &#177; 0.02. In thioether oxidation reactions, selectivity for sulfoxide products (95&#8208;99%) in acetonitrile is observed, suggesting the use of a reduced POV&#8208;alkoxide prevents over&#8208;oxidation of substrate.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational construction of a pyrimido[2,1&#8208;b]benzothiazole&#8208;based photoswitchable smart AIE material: A theoretical insight into fluorescence switching mechanism of the chimeric dyad</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Currently, AIEgen&#8208;photochromics conjugates and intrinsic photochromic AIEgens are the two major molecular design strategies for photoresponsive AIE materials. However, these two strategies still have their own limitations. In our previous research, we discovered pyrimido[2,1&#8208;b][1,3]benzothiazole (PBT) as a novel core structure of AIEgens. We herein explored a chimeric strategy to rationally integrate photochromic bisthienylethene (BTE) as the orthogonal head group into a new PBT molecule (PBTE). Compared to the conventional design strategies, the compact chimeric design of PBTE not only well maintains the AIE and photochromic properties of the parent fragments but also leads to excellent AIE&#8208;photoswitching capability in both films and single crystals. Theoretical calculations revealed that MO energy level arrangement of PBTE reorganized upon photoisomerization and the fast vibrational relaxation (VR) along with internal conversion (IC) from S5 to S1 state may serve as a competitive channel for the fluorescence quenching of PBTE&#8208;c. Comparison of the kinetics of the nonradiative decay with those of the excited&#8208;state energy transfer (EET) processes clearly showed that the ultrafast intramolecular F&#1255;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is the dominant cause of fluorescence&#8208;off state. The applications of PBTE in erasable optical memory material and multi&#8208;dimensional anti&#8208;counterfeiting have also been demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Amine&#8208;Imine Tautomeric Excited State Intramolecular Proton Transfer in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Alcohol and Anion Recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three amino functionalized compounds have been synthesized to explore the intramolecular proton transfer in excited state (ESIPT) through amine&#8208;imine tautomerism. These materials exhibit ESIPT based dual emission in water but in presence of small chain alcohols and some strong oxidizing anions, the compounds show a single emission maximum indicating the suppression of ESIPT behavior.

To study the amine&#8208;imine tautomeric alteration through excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT), three amine&#8208;functionalized metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been synthesized by using two different metal ions and neutral linkers along with same ESIPT&#8208;enable anionic linker through the slow diffusion process. All the MOFs have 2D structure with asymmetric units of {[Mn(2,6&#8208;dip)(2&#8208;atp)](H2O)(CH3OH)}n (1), {[Mn(3,5&#8208;dip)(2&#8208;atp)](solvent)x}n (2) and {Zn2(3,5&#8208;dip)2(2&#8208;atp)(&#956;2&#8208;O2&#8722;)](solvent)x}n (3) (where 2,6&#8208;dip=2,6&#8208;di(1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridine, 3,5&#8208;dip=3,5&#8208;di(1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridine, 2&#8208;atp=2&#8208;amino terephthalic acid). The 2D networks of desolvated form of compound 1, 2, and 3 show water influencing proton transfer for amine&#8208;imine tautomerism in excited state through the ionic interaction with water molecules to the frameworks. However, in case of polar small chain aliphatic alcohols like methanol, ethanol and isopropanol; the compounds do not show any dual emissive ESIPT but exhibit three different intensified single peaks for each of the compounds. This different emission intensity in presence of different alcohols are helpful to detect these alcohols selectively. In addition to that in case of all three compounds, the water assisted&#8208;ESIPT is interrupted by some strong oxidizing agents like CrO42&#8722;, Cr2O72&#8722; and MnO4&#8722; ions. This phenomenon allows the method of detection for the aforesaid oxidizing ions in water by interruption of the dual emissive fluorescence.

         <title>Electronic Interactions in Coulombic Associated Photoactive Macrocycles to Chemically Modified MoS2 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three different nanoensembles interfacing 2H&#8208;MoS2 and Coulombic&#8208;associated Zn&#8208;metalated phthalocyanine, Zn&#8208;metalated porphyrin and a boron dipyrromethene, are described and fully characterized. The three nanoensembles, complementary covering a wide visible absorbance range, are comparatively studied, with a focus on the electronic communication achieved between MoS2 and the respective photoactive molecules, in both the ground and the excited state.







Abstract
Whilst functionalization of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), and more specifically MoS2, has flourished the past decade, the accommodation of photoactive molecules on their lattice has unlocked the potentiality of this family of materials in a series of optoelectronic and energy related applications. The electronic communication between the chromophore and MoS2, in such systems, has been thoroughly studied, in cases where the grafting of the former on the latter is secured through covalent bonding. However, comparatively less attention has been drawn in cases where the chromophore is electrostatically anchored on MoS2, a means that potentially provides alternative ways of spatially accommodating the ligand on the TMD's extended environment, which directly affects the electronic communication between the two entities. In this work, we comparatively study the photophysical characteristics of three separate nanoensembles, where MoS2 is electrostatically hosting a Zn&#8208;phthalocyanine, a Zn&#8208;porphyrin, and a boron&#8208;dipyrromethene, that complementary cover a wide range of visible absorption, via UV&#8208;Vis and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The results highlight the strong interactions in the excited state across all chromophores, while the ground&#8208;state interactions vary from chromophore to chromophore, indicating a distinct energy exchange dependent on the specific nanoensemble.

         <title>Methyl&#8208;&#960; Interactions. Nature of Bonding and Limits of Strength</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
There is growing evidence that the methyl group and the phenyl ring tend to align themselves consistent with the idea of an attractive force between them. DFT calculations determine the strength of this binding and how it is affected by substituents on the two groups. The binding energy is measured to lie between 1 and 5&#8197;kcal/mol, the latter equivalent to a typical H&#8208;bond, e.&#8201;g. between water molecules. The calculations further probe the nature of the interaction and whether it is best characterized as a tetrel bond or a CH&#8901;&#8901;&#960; H&#8208;bond.







Abstract
Both methyl groups and benzene rings are exceedingly common, and they lie near one another in many chemical situations. DFT calculations are used to gauge the strength of the attractive forces between them, and to better understand the phenomena that underlie this attraction. Methane and benzene are taken as the starting point, and substituents of both electron&#8208;withdrawing and donating types are added to each. The interaction energy varies between 1.4 and 5.0&#8197;kcal/mol, depending upon the substituents placed on the two groups. The nature of the binding is analyzed via Atoms in Molecules (AIM), Natural Bond Orbital (NBO), Symmetry&#8208;Adapted Perturbation Theory (SAPT), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shifts, and electron density shift diagrams. While there is a sizable electrostatic component, it is dispersion that dominates these interactions, particularly the weaker ones. As such, these interactions cannot be categorized unambiguously as either H&#8208;bonds or tetrel bonds.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;high specific surface area porous carbon: hierarchical porous carbon material (HPC&#8208;300) was prepared by using polyacrylonitrile as carbon source and potassium hydroxide as activator. The symmetric supercapacitor assembled using HPC&#8208;300 has an energy density of 11.7&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a specific power of 250&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1.







Abstract
The porous structural tailoring of polyacrylonitrile&#8208;based carbon materials is the key to maximize capacitive performance. Herein, hierarchical porous carbons (HPC) with high specific surface area and controllable porosity are synthesized by preoxidation assisted alkali activation strategy using polyacrylonitrile as the precursor. The results show that high preoxidation temperature is beneficial to increase the specific surface area and pore volume of HPC. The optimized HPC&#8208;300 has a high BET specific surface area of 3161&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1, a micropore volume of 1.45&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1, and an AD/AG of 3.56. Electrochemical test shows that the specific capacitances of HPC&#8208;300 in 6&#8197;M KOH electrolyte at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 are 314.1&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 213.0&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively, with a capacitance retention of 67.8&#8201;%. The assembled supercapacitors based on HPC&#8208;300 deliver an energy density of 11.7&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 250.0&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1 in KOH electrolyte and 21.1&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at 450.0&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1 in Na2SO4 electrolyte and possess a capacitance retention of 98.1&#8201;% over 20,000 charge&#8208;discharge cycles. This preoxidation coupled activation method provides a potential strategy for the preparation of PAN&#8208;based porous carbon with high specific surface area and capacitance.

The central compound of this new approach is 2,5,8&#8208;tri(1H&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;s&#8208;heptazine that was synthesized via an acid catalyzed pyrrolation of melem with 2,5&#8208;dimethoxytetrahydrofuran, which proved to be a potent starting material for the synthesis of further monomeric s&#8208;heptazines by reaction with both nucleophiles and electrophiles.







Abstract
Monomeric s&#8208;heptazines are an intriguing class of compounds with many attractive properties for various areas of application such as photocatalysis or organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. However, research into these properties has so far been challenging, as only a few synthetic routes for the preparation of monomeric s&#8208;heptazines are known in the literature. Furthermore, these few reported synthetic pathways generally require the use of specialized equipment that may not be available to all laboratories interested in studying monomeric s&#8208;heptazines. For this reason, a more accessible synthetic route for the preparation of monomeric s&#8208;heptazines has been developed in the course of this work. The central compound of this new approach is 2,5,8&#8208;tri(1H&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;s&#8208;heptazine, which could be conveniently synthesized via an acid catalyzed pyrrolation of melem with bench&#8208;stable 2,5&#8208;dimethoxytetrahydrofuran in a simple one&#8208;pot synthesis in air. This compound was shown to be a potent starting material for the synthesis of numerous other monomeric s&#8208;heptazines by reaction with both nucleophiles and electrophiles. The monomeric s&#8208;heptazines thus accessible were analyzed for their crystal structures by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and for their optical properties by ultraviolet/visible and photoluminescence spectroscopy.

         <title>Diiron(IV)&#8208;Oxo Species and Water Oxidation: How Crucial is Electronic Cooperativity?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study employs DFT methods to elucidate the catalytic mechanism of water oxidation by a high&#8208;valent diiron(IV)&#8208;oxo complex. The findings reveal a bifurcated electron&#8208;proton transfer pathway, highlight the role of adventitious water molecules in stabilizing intermediates, and emphasize the importance of spin&#8208;state modulation, metal&#8208;metal cooperativity, and ligand design in driving efficient O&#8722;H bond activation.







Abstract
Water splitting, crucial for generating oxygen and hydrogen, remains a central challenge in chemistry due to its importance in developing sustainable energy sources and addressing environmental concerns. Consequently, numerous complexes have been developed to split water and release oxygen and hydrogen, albeit typically requiring external sources such as thermal, photo, or electrochemical methods. In this context, the discovery of a (&#956;&#8208;oxo)bis(&#956;&#8208;carboxamido) diiron(IV) complex, [FeIV&#8322;O(L)&#8322;]2+ (L=N,N&#8208;bis&#8208;(3&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4&#8217;&#8208;methoxypyridyl&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;methyl)&#8208;N&#8217;&#8208;acetyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminoethane), which activates both C&#8722;H and O&#8722;H bonds without external stimuli, has attracted significant attention. Notably, this complex generates hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) without O&#8322; evolution and displays termolecular kinetics, presenting a rare and intriguing mechanistic puzzle. In this work, we explore the catalytic mechanism of water oxidation by this diiron(IV) complex using DFT methods. Our computational findings validate experimental observations regarding the necessity of a second water molecule in the reaction, revealing a bifurcated electron&#8208;proton transfer (BEPT) pathway driven by termolecular reactivity. Moreover, we highlight the crucial role of excess water molecules in stabilising the reaction intermediates, particularly via interaction with the &#8208;OMe groups to form a water cluster model. The inclusion of explicit water molecules was found to reduce the activation barrier to 23.5&#8197;kJ/mol from the reactant and 62.7&#8197;kJ/mol from the reactant complex, whereas, with only one water molecule present, the barrier was 344.3&#8197;kJ/mol, highlighting the critical role of the adventitious water molecule at the active site. Our study underscores the importance of metal&#8208;metal cooperativity, ligand design, spin&#8208;state modulation, and second&#8208;sphere effects in shaping the catalytic behaviour. These insights provide a detailed understanding of the electronic structure and reactivity, offering valuable guidelines for future catalyst design in water oxidation and beyond.

         <title>Unveiling Quantum Coherence Effects in Modulating Electron Transfer in Platinum (II) Donor&#8208;Acceptor&#8208;Donor Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Discover the pivotal role of quantum coherence effects (QCEs) in modulating electron transfer within cis&#8208;acetylide Pt(II) donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8208;A&#8208;D) systems. Using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, we unveil how charge separation (CS) rates are amplified 4&#8211;8&#8208;fold, driven by quantum interference. The findings reveal a 2&#8211;3&#8208;fold enhancement in electronic coupling, shedding light on advanced charge transport mechanisms.







Abstract
Quantum coherence effects (QCEs), arising from the interference of wave&#8208;like amplitudes, are crucial in controlling the electron transfer function of molecular systems. Here, we report a coherence phenomenon associated with charge separation (CS) in a range of Pt (II) cis&#8208;acetylide donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8208;A&#8208;D) systems, where the photogenerated Pt (III) center acts as an acceptor connecting two (R)phenothiazine (R = H or tBu) donors. Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy revealed that CS rates in D&#8208;A&#8208;D systems with double CS paths were accelerated by 4&#8211;8 times compared to their donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) counterparts with a single path. An enhancement factor of 2&#8211;3 in electronic coupling, within the context of interference between CS paths, is derived, providing a clear signature of QCEs. This enhancementin CS processes closely correlates with the strength of coupling between donors. This study highlights the significant impact of QCEs on the photophysical properties of molecular systems and offers insights into charge and energy transport mechanisms in both natural and artificial systems.

The simple bowl&#8208;shaped macrocyclic host promotes conformational fixing and crystallization of the guest molecules of high conformational freedom in aqueous media. The binding site in both crystal structures is the central aliphatic chain enabling guest folding through adopting gauche conformation upon entering the calix[4]arene cavity.







Abstract
We report on the U&#8208;shaped folding of flexible guest molecules of medicinal interest upon their inclusion into macrocyclic cavity of p&#8208;sulfonato&#8208;calix[4]arene in aqueous media. Alexidine and pentamidine are FDA&#8208;approved drug compounds currently rediscovered as potent membrane&#8208;targeting antibiotic adjuvants helping restore antibiotic activity against multidrug resistant bacteria pathogens. We have adopted host&#8208;guest and crystal engineering approach to study these drugs with a view of potential supramolecular formulations and/or crystal forms. We focus on the host&#8208;guest conformational and structural behaviour of alexidine and pentamidine under macrocyclic confinement conditions benefitting from single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, self&#8208;assembly studies in solution by NMR spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering and atomic force microscopy, and ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM&#8211;MS) analysis complemented by theoretical calculations. Our findings show that the simple bowl&#8208;shaped host promotes conformational fixing and crystallization of these guest molecules of high conformational freedom that are otherwise challenging to crystallize. The IM&#8211;MS structural studies of p&#8208;sulfonato&#8208;calix[4]arene complexes with pentamidine and alexidine revealed significant guest reorganization in the solution/gas phase, compared to the binding modes observed in the crystal structures. Despite these changes, the host&#8208;guest complexation remained consistent, with new interactions highlighting the increased role of electrostatic forces in the gas phase.

         <title>Silicon&#8208;Based Linkers for Tunable Acid&#8208;Sensitive Drug Release from Polymeric Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by silyl protecting groups we have developed silicon based linkers having both a hydroxyl containing drug and a polymerizable group. Upon polymerization nanoparticles are formed from which the drug can be released under acidic conditions. This opens up possibilities for future use of these nanoparticles in treatment of diseases. As a model we have studied the release of gemcitabine.







Abstract
Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) may benefit from a carrier to improve their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Core&#8208;crosslinked polymeric micelles (CCPMs) are carriers for hydrophobic small molecule APIs. In CCPMs, APIs are generally covalently coupled to the core of the micelles by use of a linker, which can be tailored to adjust the release rate of the API. Acid triggered release is promising because of local acidic environment in the tissue of interest, and expected uptake via endocytosis. In the present study, silyl&#8208;based linkers were synthesized, and attached to gemcitabine as model API to investigate the tunability of release by introduction of different substituents. Attachment was achieved via an Si ether bond, with the linker coupled to the primary alcohol functionality on gemcitabine. By varying the substituents on the silyl atom, we could vary the release half&#8208;life (t1/2) of native gemcitabine from &lt;1&#8197;hour&#8211;&gt;96&#8197;hours at pH&#8197;5.0 at 37&#8201;&#176;C, compared to a t1/2 of 24&#8211;&gt;240&#8197;hours at pH&#8197;7.4 at 37&#8201;&#176;C, respectively. The steric hinderance caused by substituents contributed to an increase of t1/2 at pH&#8197;5.0, as the largest substituents resulted in the slowest release. Extension to other APIs and other carriers is clearly possible.

     alt="Silicon-Based Linkers for Tunable Acid-Sensitive Drug Release from Polymeric Nanoparticles"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by silyl protecting groups we have developed silicon based linkers having both a hydroxyl containing drug and a polymerizable group. Upon polymerization nanoparticles are formed from which the drug can be released under acidic conditions. This opens up possibilities for future use of these nanoparticles in treatment of diseases. As a model we have studied the release of gemcitabine.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) may benefit from a carrier to improve their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Core-crosslinked polymeric micelles (CCPMs) are carriers for hydrophobic small molecule APIs. In CCPMs, APIs are generally covalently coupled to the core of the micelles by use of a linker, which can be tailored to adjust the release rate of the API. Acid triggered release is promising because of local acidic environment in the tissue of interest, and expected uptake via endocytosis. In the present study, silyl-based linkers were synthesized, and attached to gemcitabine as model API to investigate the tunability of release by introduction of different substituents. Attachment was achieved via an Si ether bond, with the linker coupled to the primary alcohol functionality on gemcitabine. By varying the substituents on the silyl atom, we could vary the release half-life (t&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;) of native gemcitabine from &amp;lt;1&#8197;hour&#8211;&amp;gt;96&#8197;hours at pH&#8197;5.0 at 37&#8201;&#176;C, compared to a t&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; of 24&#8211;&amp;gt;240&#8197;hours at pH&#8197;7.4 at 37&#8201;&#176;C, respectively. The steric hinderance caused by substituents contributed to an increase of t&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; at pH&#8197;5.0, as the largest substituents resulted in the slowest release. Extension to other APIs and other carriers is clearly possible.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Single&#8208;molecule Magnet Properties of Silole&#8208; and Stannole&#8208;ligated Erbium Cyclo&#8208;octatetraenyl Sandwich Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis, structures and dynamic magnetic properties of erbium&#8208;silole and erbium&#8208;stannole complexes are reported and compared to those of the analogous erbium&#8208;germole complex. Remarkable similarities in the single&#8208;molecule magnet properties of the three complexes are unearthed, highlighting the minimal role of the heavier group 14 elements in slow magnetic relaxation behaviour.







Abstract
The synthesis, structures and magnetic properties of an &#951;5&#8208;silole complex and an &#951;5&#8208;stannole complex of erbium are reported. The sandwich complex anions [(&#951;5&#8208;CpSi)Er(&#951;8&#8208;COT)]&#8211; and [(&#951;5&#8208;CpSn)Er(&#951;8&#8208;COT)]&#8211;, where CpSi is [SiC4&#8208;2,5&#8208;(SiMe3)2&#8208;3,4&#8208;Ph2]2&#8211; (1Si), CpSn is [SnC4&#8208;2,5&#8208;(SiMe3)2&#8208;3,4&#8208;Me2]2&#8211; (1Sn) and COT=cyclo&#8208;octatetraenyl, were obtained as their [K(2.2.2&#8208;cryptand)]+ salts and found to be isostructural, with remarkably similar bond lengths and angles, differing only in the lengths of the Er&#8211;E interactions (E=Si, Sn). The parallels in the molecular structures of 1Si and 1Sn are reflected in their dynamic magnetic properties, which show single&#8208;molecule magnet behaviour in zero applied field, with effective energy barriers of 115&#177;7 and 125&#177;3 cm&#8211;1, respectively, along with comparable magnetic relaxation times. Analysis of the two complexes using ab initio calculations reveals differences at a quantitative level, but overall similar electronic structures, with the thermally activated relaxation likely to proceed via the first&#8208;excited Kramers doublet. Comparing 1Si and 1Sn with the previously reported germanium analogue 1Ge reveals that swapping one heavier group 14 element for another in complexes of the type [(&#951;5&#8208;CpE)Er(&#951;8&#8208;COT)]&#8211; has a minimal impact on the SMM behaviour.

         <title>Tetrabutylammonium Chlorite as an Efficient Oxidant for Controlled Oxidation of Sulfides to Sulfoxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrabutylammonium chlorite exhibited excellent solubility in organic solvents and enabled selective oxidation of organosulfides and sulfide polymers under ambient conditions, enhancing surface hydrophilicity effectively.







Abstract
Considering the demand for organosulfur materials and the challenges associated with currently used oxidation processes, in this study, we evaluated the counter&#8208;cation of sodium chlorite (Na+ClO2&#8722;) with tetrabutylammonium chloride (Bu4N+Cl&#8722;) to synthesise tetrabutylammonium chlorite (Bu4N+ClO2&#8722;). Bu4N+ClO2&#8722; exhibited good solubility in organic solvents like chloroform (5.2&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1) and ethyl acetate (2.8&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1). The oxygenation reaction of organosulfides with Bu4N+ClO2&#8722; was examined in an HCl&#8208;acidic ethyl acetate solution under ambient conditions, selectively forming the corresponding sulfoxides as mono&#8208;oxygenated products. The reaction was initiated by the formation of chlorine dioxide (ClO2&#8901;) as an oxidant and an active species generated from Bu4N+ClO2&#8722; with HCl. This oxygenation method also enables the surface oxidation of sulfide polymers like polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) resins to increase their surface hydrophilicity. Therefore, the use of Bu4N+ClO2&#8722; for applications in organic solvents is an efficient, and highly selective approach for selective oxidation.

         <title>Photoinduced Radical Luminescence of Diazapyrene Derivatives upon Complexation with Cucurbit[n]uril Hosts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular design with an electron donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) structure and host&#8208;guest complexation are effective strategies for stabilizing radicals. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of cationic diazapyrene derivatives featuring a D&#8208;A structure, as well as the influence of host&#8208;guest complexation on their photoinduced organic radical photophysical properties. Compared to the methylated diazapyrene 1, the other three derivatives 2&#8208;4, containing triphenylamine, coumarin, and naphthalene units as D groups, respectively, are more favorable for the generation of radicals. Binding studies reveal that cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) forms 1:1 inclusion complexes with derivatives 2&#8208;4, while CB[10] forms a 2:2 inclusion complex with 2 and supramolecular polymers with 3 and 4. The radical luminescence of derivatives 1&#8208;4 in aqueous solution is significantly promoted upon complexation with CB[8] or CB[10]. Additionally, the emission color of 3&#160;shifts from cyan to yellow&#8208;green upon light irradiation in the presence of CB[8].</dc:description>

         <title>Theoretical Study on Binary Monolayers P3S&#8208;I for Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The utilization of visible light to split water into H&#8322; and O&#8322; offers a promising solution to address the escalating global energy crisis and environmental pollution. Compared to conventional three&#8208;dimensional (3D) photocatalysts, anisotropic two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials exhibit enhanced photocatalytic activity due to their ultrahigh surface area, reduced charge migration distance, and improved efficiency. In this study, we employ a swarm&#8208;intelligence search combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations to propose a novel series of stable 2D phosphorus sulfides, P&#8339;S&#7527; (x, y = 1&#8211;6), as promising candidates for photocatalytic water splitting.&#160; The P3S&#8208;I monolayer exhibits an optimal bandgap (2.485 eV), appropriate band edge positions (&#8722;3.52 eV for CBM and &#8722;6.00 eV for VBM at the HSE06 level), high carrier mobility (3246.85 cm&#178; V&#8315;&#185; s&#8315;&#185; for &#956;&#8337; along the y&#8208;direction and 1039.80 cm&#178; V&#8315;&#185; s&#8315;&#185; for &#956;&#8341; along the x&#8208;direction), and strong optical absorption coefficients (exceeding 1 &#215; 10&#8309; cm&#8315;&#185; within the visible spectrum). Notably, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are facilitated concurrently at the P and S sites, respectively, driven exclusively by photogenerated electrons and holes.</dc:description>

         <title>Chalcogen Vacancies as Key Drivers of Distinct Physicochemistry in MoS2, MoSe2, and MoTe2&#160;for Selective Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic performance of Mo&#8208;based transition&#8208;metal&#8208;dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers is intrinsically tied to their physicochemical properties. However, the limited chemical diversity among these materials constrains their versatility for key catalytic processes, including carbon dioxide (CRR), nitrogen (NRR), and oxygen (ORR) reduction reactions. This study employs density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the impact of chalcogen vacancies on the properties of MoS2, MoSe2, and MoTe2, focusing on the adsorption behaviors of CO, NO, and NO2. The findings reveal that chalcogen vacancies not only enhance surface reactivity but also impart distinctive physicochemical characteristics to each TMD. These effects arise from intrinsic bonding differences, resulting in distinct charge availability at exposed Mo atoms and variations in vacancy dimensions, which shape specific surface interactions. Hence, while adsorption differences between pristine surfaces are generally negligible for catalysis, vacancies amplify them by over an order of magnitude, resulting in pronounced material&#8208;specific behaviors. Moreover, varying vacancy dimensions affect how species incorporate into defects, further enhancing the differences. These characteristics unlock substantial potential of TMD sheets for distinct surface chemistries, transforming them from relatively similar to markedly different as defect density rises. Consequently, our findings provide fundamental insights for tailoring these materials toward applications in electro&#8208; and photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Diboron Reagents in N&#8208;N Bond Cleavage of Hydrazines, N&#8208;Nitrosamines, and Azides: Reactivity and Mechanistic Insights</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diboron reagents are known for their ability to promote the deoxygenation of amine or pyridine oxides, nitroarenes, and nitrones through the formation of B&#8208;O&#8208;B bonds. In this study, we have investigated the potential of diboron reagents to induce N&#8208;N bond cleavage in hydrazines, N&#8208;nitrosamines and azides. Our findings show that the combination of B2nep2 as diboron source and KOMe as a Lewis base can effectively promote the N&#8208;N cleavage of a wide variety of substrates. For hydrazines and nitrosamines, the presence of an aryl group is essential for the reaction to proceed, probably due to a better stabilization of the negative charge developed during N&#8208;N bond cleavage. Both types of azides, aromatic and aliphatic, are easily reduced, and the resulting amines can be in situ converted into the corresponding amides by simple treatment with a carboxylic acid. Experimental and theoretical calculations suggest a non&#8208;radical mechanism, with concerted B&#8208;B and N&#8208;N bond cleavage in the case of hydrazines and azides, and a stepwise mechanism in the case of N&#8208;nitrosamines, where deoxygenation occurs as the first step, involving the formation of an N&#8208;nitrene intermediate</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Hetero&#8208;tetra&#8208;metallic complexes, FeNOCuLnCo (Ln = Gd, Tb, Dy), combining magnetic properties and photo&#8208;isomerism, were obtained through the rational assembly of the photo&#8208;switching nitroprusside anion FeNO with new magnetic Schiff base CuLnCo precursors. Herein, we describe the synthesis and characterisation of these compounds followed by a demonstration of their multifunctional character. Particularly noteworthy is the FeNOCuTbCo complex, one of the few examples of a photo&#8208;isomerizable single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) and a significant first step toward achieving synergistic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioinspired Total Synthesis and Structural Reidentification of Alstrostines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alstrostine A and isoalstrostine A are monoterpenoid indole alkaloid glycosides with unique structures found in the plant families Apocynaceae and Rubiaceae. With molecular weights exceeding 900, nine&#160;chiral centers (excluding sugar rings), and complex fused&#8208;ring structures, the structural elucidation of these molecules using spectral analysis is highly challenging. Therefore, their structural identification through total synthesis is important in both natural product chemistry and synthetic organic chemistry. In this study, we successfully accomplished the first asymmetric total syntheses of these alkaloids in 18 or 19 steps. A key synthetic feature was a two&#8208; or three&#8208;component coupling reaction between secologanin and a pyrrolidinoindoline moiety based on our proposed biosynthetic pathway. This approach enabled the synthesis of all isomers of the pyrrolidinoindoline ring, which constitutes the upper fragment of the alstrostines, and allowed us to revise the stereochemistry of alstrostine A. Additionally, a compound previously isolated as alstrostine A from Palicourea luxurians (Rubiaceae) was successfully reidentified and renamed as epialstrostine A.</dc:description>

         <title>Homochiral Carboxylate&#8208;Anchored Truxene Tripods: Design, Synthesis, Monolayer Formation on Ag(111)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of well&#8208;defined assemblies of chiral molecules is a prerequisite for numerous applications, such as chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS). In this context, tripodal molecular films bear the advantage of better control of molecular orientation and alignment than analogous monopodal systems. To this end, we report on the synthesis and assembly property of C3 chiral syn&#8208;5,10,15&#8208;truxene triacetic acid. (S,S,S) and (R,R,R) enantiomers were isolated and adsorbed on underpotential deposited Ag(111)/Au/mica both individually and as a racemate. The enantiomers form a densely packed and well&#8208;ordered structure (including the azimuthal alignment), even though with small sizes of individual domains. The molecules adsorb predominantly in tripodal configuration, with all three docking groups bound to the substrate as carboxylates in a bidentate fashion. The truxene backbone is then oriented parallel to the substrate surface but the fluorene blades are twisted to some extent. The racemate monolayer turned out to be less densely packed and less well&#8208;ordered compared to the films of individual enantiomers, which underlines the fact that uniform chirality is primarily important for molecular ordering of the truxenes. We hope that the designed system will be useful in the context of CISS and stimulate further activities regarding chiral tripods.</dc:description>

         <title>Radical Cation of Tris(triarylamine) Connected through 1,2,3&#8208;Benzenetriyl Bridge: A Three&#8208;Redox&#8208;Center Organic Mixed&#8208;Valence System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To explore intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (ICT) pathways in three&#8208;redox&#8208;center organic mixed&#8208;valence (MV) radical cation, a tris(triarylamine) (TTA), in which three triarylamine (TA) redox&#8208;active centers are connected in a side&#8208;by&#8208;side fashion via 1,2,3&#8208;benzenetriyl bridging unit, has been newly synthesized. The MV state of the TTA radical cation has been investigated by a combination of experimental and theoretical methods, and the ICT pathway between three redox&#8208;active centers has been revealed. The intervalence CT (IVCT) band analysis gave an electronic coupling value comparable to the&#160;ortho&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bridged bis(triarylamine) radical cation. Dynamic electron spin resonance studies clarified that the TTA radical cation was a nondegenerate MV system exhibiting ICT between the central TA and the peripheral TAs through the&#160;ortho&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bridge.</dc:description>

         <title>External Phosphate Binding Triggered Formation of Coordination Bridged Dimer of Macrocyclic Trinuclear Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrocyclic complexes with spatially&#8208;arranged coordination sites have the potential to create unique supramolecular systems that combine the precise switching of self&#8208;assembled structures with the coordinative recognition of specific molecules. We now report a macrocyclic trinuclear Zn complex that undergoes a unique dimerization by molecular binding from the outside. The multinuclear complex was synthesized from a trispap ligand, a designed macrocyclic trimer of an&#160;N,N,O&#8208;type tridentate chelating unit pap. This macrocyclic ligand is capable of fixing the metal centers and retaining their exchangeable coordination sites. The macrocyclic trimer reacts with zinc acetate to form the trinuclear complex, in which the coordination sites of the three zinc atoms are aligned perpendicular to the macrocyclic plane and capped with the acetates. Subsequently, phosphate anion, PO43&#8211;, coordinates from one side of the macrocycle in a tripodal manner. This phosphate binding produced an electrically&#8208;neutral complex moiety with available coordination sites on the other side of the macrocycle which leads to the formation of the coordination&#8208;bridged dimer.</dc:description>

         <title>Mitochondrial Localization of Antioxidant Nanodrug Suppresses Ocular Inflammation by Alleviating Oxidative Stress on Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 10, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conjugation of a polyphenolic antioxidant with a small peptide generates a self&#8208;assembled nanodrug, which suppresses ocular inflammation by attenuating oxidative stress in mitochondria after escaping from lysosome. As an investigation of anti&#8208;inflammation by the mitochondrial localization of antioxidant, this work establishes a foundation by regulating cellular redox balance for developing drug delivery systems in the treatment of ocular disorders.







Abstract
External environments (e.&#8201;g., pollutants, irritants, ultraviolet radiation, etc) probably activate oxidative stress on the ocular surface, further leading to inflammatory responses and cellular apoptosis. For treating ophthalmic diseases, one of the strategies is to regulate oxidative stress through antioxidants. Here we conjugate a polyphenolic antioxidant drug (i.&#8201;e., caffeic acid) with a small peptide of protein tag to generate a peptide&#8208;drug conjugate as a nanodrug. With a self&#8208;assembled ability to form nanoparticles, the nanodrug mainly enters human corneal epithelial cells (HCEC) by caveolin&#8208;mediated endocytosis, succeeds lysosomal escape, and achieves mitochondrial localization of caffeic acid. Revealed by free radical scavenging experiments, the nanodrug shows considerable antioxidant capacities. In mouse leukemia cells of monocyte macrophage (RAW 264.7) induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the nanodrug inhibits various pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines (e.&#8201;g., NO, IL&#8208;6, and TNF&#8208;&#945;) by up&#8208;regulating the expression of anti&#8208;apoptotic protein (e.&#8201;g., Bcl&#8208;2). As an investigation of alleviating oxidative stress by the mitochondrial localization of antioxidant, this work may establish an experimental foundation for the regulation of cellular redox balance, as well as provide different insights for the clinical development of antioxidant drug delivery systems in the treatment of ocular disease.

         <title>Exploring Glycan&#8208;Lectin Interactions in Natural&#8208;Like Environments: A View Using NMR Experiments Inside Cell and on Cell Surface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 10, February 17, 2025. </description>

NMR methods are applied to uncover molecular recognition events between synthetic glycan molecules and lectin receptors within the cell and on the cell surface. The interaction between 15&#8197;N&#8208;labelled human galectin&#8208;7 with thioglycoside is monitored within living Danio rerio oocytes using HMQC experiments, while the binding epitope of a sialoside ligand to human Siglec&#8208;10, at the surface of HEK293F cells, is unraveled by STD&#8208;NMR.







Abstract
Glycan&#8208;mediated molecular recognition events are essential for life. NMR is widely used to monitor glycan binding to lectins in solution using isolated glycans and lectins. In this context, we herein explore diverse NMR methodologies, from both the receptor and ligand perspectives, to monitor glycan&#8208;lectin interactions under experimental conditions mimicking the native milieu inside cells and on cell surface. For the NMR experiments inside cells, galectin&#8208;7 is employed as model, since most galectins are soluble and carry out their functions in the cellular micro&#8208;environment. Using Danio Rerio oocytes, the 1H&#8208;15N HMQC NMR spectrum of a folded galectin has been observed inside cell for the first time, using a glycomimetic ligand (TDG) to overcoming the natural tendency of galectins to bind to numerous galactose&#8208;containing receptors within cells. Alternatively, most lectins, other than galectins, are displayed on the cell surface, providing a multivalent presentation to bind their glycan partners in cis (at the same cell) or in trans (on other cells). In this case, ligand&#8208;based STD&#8208;NMR experiments have been successfully applied to account for the interactions of natural glycans and glycomimetics with Siglec&#8208;10. These methodologies provide the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept to open the door to the NMR analysis of the recognition of glycans in native&#8208;like settings.

         <title>Methane to Methanol Transformation on Cu2+/H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolite. Characterization of Copper State and Mechanism of the Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 10, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methane to methanol transformation on Cu&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite has been studied by UV&#8208;vis, EPR, EXAFS, FTIR, MAS NMR methods. Methane activation is found to occur on paired Cu2+ sites with the surface methoxy species being formed. DFT calculations suggest methane activation occurs through the &#8220;alkyl&#8221; pathway and the formed copper&#8208;methyl species are further transformed to methoxy ones.







Abstract
Cu&#8208;modified zeolites provide methane conversion to methanol with high selectivity under mild conditions. The activity of different Cu&#8208;sites for methane transformation is still under discussion. Herein, ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite has been loaded with Cu2+ cations (1.4&#8197;wt&#8201;% Cu) as characterized by UV&#8208;vis DRS, EPR, EXAFS, and 1H MAS NMR. It is inferred that Cu2+ cations, attached to the cation&#8208;exchange Al&#8722;O&#8722;&#8722;Si sites of the zeolite framework, can exist in the form of either isolated or paired Cu2+ sites. The transformation of methane to methanol on Cu2+/H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 has been verified by the observation of the methoxy species formation with 13C MAS NMR and FTIR spectroscopy. The related mechanisms have been analyzed by DFT calculations. The calculations show that the paired Cu2+ sites enable heterolytic C&#8722;H bond dissociation via the &#8220;alkyl&#8221; pathway resulting in methylcopper species, which however are not detected experimentally due to further rapid transformation to surface methoxy species through methyl radical formation and recombination with Si&#8722;O&#8722;Al site. Based on the obtained data, it has been concluded that methane transformation to methanol on paired Cu2+ sites, having no extra&#8208;framework oxygen ligand, is possible in Cu&#8208;modified zeolites. The pathways of Cu2+ cations regeneration with O2 and H2O have been experimentally explored.

         <title>PDA/PMMA Blend Membrane Utilized for the Selective Adsorption and Separation of Heavy Metal Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 10, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heavy metal ion pollution in water has severely threatened human health. Membrane separation technology is often used to adsorb and remove heavy metal ions from water. However, efficiently separating and removing heavy metal ions in water is still a challenging task. We fabricated a PDA/PMMA blend membrane drawing inspiration from mussel silk protein. Relying on the dopa group within the blend membrane, the selective adsorption and removal of heavy metal ions in water can be accomplished.







Abstract
The detrimental effects of heavy metal aqueous pollution are attracting people's attention increasingly. Membrane separation technology plays a pivotal role in the treatment of aqueous pollution due to its low energy consumption and excellent separation effect. Inspired by the strong adhesion of heavy metal ions by the dopamine in mussel protein, we have fabricated the 5&#8201;%, 10&#8201;%, 20&#8201;% and 30&#8201;% proportion of polydopamine (PDA)/Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) blend membranes with dopamine structure by solvent&#8208;induced phase conversion. I&#8722;V current, UV titration and transmission tests examined the membrane's selective adsorption and retention capabilities for Fe3+, Cu2+ and Cr3+. These experiments indicated the different selectivity for Fe3+ of four blend membranes with varying PDA/PMMA fractions. Based on Langmuir's adsorption theory, the 10&#8201;% blend membranes exhibited the most outstanding selective adsorption for Fe3+ with an LOD of 4.724&#215;10&#8211;9 M. Moreover, the ability to retain Fe3+ is still close to 100&#8201;% after 48&#8197;h of transmission. This study manifested that the PDA/PMMA blend membrane is capable of adsorbing trace amounts of Fe3+ from water, thereby contributing to aqueous purification.

Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of &#945;&#8208;D nucleosides to supramolecular hydrogels is described in detail. Hydrogel formation is studied on &#945;&#8208;D 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyguanosine (&#945;&#8208;dG), and the fluorescent 8&#8208;azapurine &#945;&#8208;D nucleosides 2&#8208;amino&#8208;8&#8208;aza&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyadenosine (&#945;&#8208;2&#8208;NH2&#8208;z8Ad) and 8&#8208;aza&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyisoguanosine (&#945;&#8208;z8iGd). These compounds were prepared from &#945;&#8208;D 8&#8208;aza&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyguanosine by an activation/amination protocol followed by deamination. Protonation and deprotonation pKa values of monomeric nucleosides were determined. Fluorescence measurements displayed the pH&#8208;dependent fluorescence intensity of &#945;&#8208;D 8&#8208;azapurine nucleosides. &#945;&#8208;dG and &#945;&#8208;z8iGd self&#8208;assemble to gels that are selective for K+&#8208;ions. The &#945;&#8208;dG gel is transparent and the &#945;&#8208;z8iGd gel shows fluorescence. &#945;&#8208;2&#8208;NH2&#8208;z8Ad forms fluorescent gels in the presence of alkali metal ions of different size. SEM images expose a large condensed and flat structure for the &#945;&#8208;dG gel, whereas the &#945;&#8208;2&#8208;NH2&#8208;z8Ad gel consists of flakes that are connected to bundles. A porous structure generated by helical cylindric fibers was found for the &#945;&#8208;z8iGd gel. All &#945;&#8208;D hydrogels show long&#8208;term lifetime stability. The &#945;&#8208;z8iGd hydrogel in KCl solution has the highest Tgel value. The minimum gelation concentration of the hydrogels is 0.3&#8208;0.5&#8197;mg nucleoside/100&#8197;&#956;L alkali ion solution. In periodical step&#8208;strain experiments, the hydrogels of &#945;&#8208;dG, &#945;&#8208;2&#8208;NH2&#8208;z8Ad and &#945;&#8208;z8iGd displayed thixotropy. Based on their self&#8208;healing and shear&#8208;thinning properties the hydrogels are injectable.

         <title>Luminescence and Generation of Reactive Oxygen Species in Solution by Ta6Br12 Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 10, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work unprecedently reveals the NIR&#8208;II photoluminescence of {Ta6Br12}2+ cluster complexes dissolved in water and deuterated water, with lifetimes ranging from nanoseconds to microseconds. DFT calculations indicate that the emission is mainly associated with fluorescence transitions. Reaction with O&#8322; promotes partial quenching of the luminescence and the generation of peroxide and superoxide radical species.







Abstract
An intrinsic metal cluster NIR&#8208;II emission of the {Ta6Br12}2+ aqua/hydroxocomplexes was determined in aqueous solutions under inert atmosphere. The photoluminescence (PL) is enhanced in D2O, and the lifetime scale expands from nanoseconds to microseconds. Possible cluster emission transitions have been assigned and analyzed from a computational perspective. In the presence of O2, the cluster compound kept its robustness but showed partial quenching of the PL. Stern&#8208;Volmer and laser&#8208;flash photolysis studies confirmed that quenching is mainly associated with O2 diffusion. Laser&#8208;flash photolysis experiments showed that singlet oxygen (1O2) was not detected under measurement conditions. Generation of peroxide and superoxide radical species after irradiation in D2O was confirmed by using luminol as a probe, whereas no hydroxide radical species were detected as evidenced by the emission of the 3&#8208;coumarin carboxylic acid (3&#8208;CCA) molecular sensor.

         <title>Catalytic Conversion of Carbon Dioxide to Long Chain Esters via Formate Hydroesterification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 10, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic olefin carbonyl methods commonly rely on fossil fuel sourced carbon monoxide feedstocks. Extension of carbon dioxide hydrogenation catalysis has produced a new, selective route to long chain esters from olefins using a tandem catalytic process. In either single or dual stage reactions, cooperative ruthenium and palladium catalysts reduce CO2 to formate esters then hydroesterify olefins to generate value added esters.







Abstract
CO2&#8208;based hydroesterification is an attractive route to produce value added ester compounds, which could replace widely used CO&#8208;based hydroesterification processes if sufficient catalytic technologies are developed.

     alt="Catalytic Conversion of Carbon Dioxide to Long Chain Esters via Formate Hydroesterification"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catalytic olefin carbonyl methods commonly rely on fossil fuel sourced carbon monoxide feedstocks. Extension of carbon dioxide hydrogenation catalysis has produced a new, selective route to long chain esters from olefins using a tandem catalytic process. In either single or dual stage reactions, cooperative ruthenium and palladium catalysts reduce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to formate esters then hydroesterify olefins to generate value added esters.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based hydroesterification is an attractive route to produce value added ester compounds, which could replace widely used CO-based hydroesterification processes if sufficient catalytic technologies are developed. One path to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based hydroesterification could proceed through an organoformate intermediate, which is then used in olefin hydroesterification to generate the desirable esters. This route opens the possibility of creating a net CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based hydroesterification process using tandem catalytic systems for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation to organoformate paired with formate-olefin hydroesterification. The tandem use of tripodal phosphine ruthenium(II) and 1,2-bis(di-tert-butylphosphinomethyl)benzene palladium catalysts were found to successfully produce methyl nonanoate from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, methanol and 1-octene in a single-stage batch process. The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based hydroesterification catalysis efficiency was found to be largely limited by the productivity of organoformate generation and competitive 1-octene reduction. Catalytic yields of methyl nonanoate can be enhanced by adjustments in reaction procedures, including the use of a two-stage batch reaction process or delayed introduction of 1-octene, achieving a yield of up to 32&#8201;%. Under select conditions, control experiments indicate yields of methyl nonanoate can be improved to &lt;i&gt;ca&lt;/i&gt; 75&#8201;%.

         <title>Overcoming the Tradeoff Between Reaction Rate and Overpotential in Dinuclear Cobalt Complex Catalyzed Electrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 10, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effects of the identity of dinuclear Co electrocatalysts and reaction media on their water oxidation reaction performance were investigated. The synergistic effect of these factors resulted in distinct reaction intermediates and catalytic cycles. Modulating the catalytic potentials, as well as water, acid, and base concentrations, realized high turnover frequencies at low overpotentials.







Abstract
This study focuses on enhancing the water oxidation reaction (WOR) efficacy of dinuclear cobalt complex catalysts from both kinetic (turnover frequency, TOF) and thermodynamic (overpotential, &#951;) perspectives. For this purpose, we synthesized six dinuclear cobalt complexes 1&#8211;6 comprising non&#8208;innocent ligands with different electronically active substituents (&#8722;OMe (1), &#8722;Me (2), &#8722;H (3), &#8722;F (4), &#8722;Cl (5), and &#8722;CN (6)). The electronic effects on the electrochemical WOR under neutral, acidic, and alkaline conditions were investigated experimentally and computationally. X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed that the valence state of the cobalt complexes was affected by electronic effects, affording different catalytic potentials, as evidenced by electrochemical measurements. Kinetic and spectroscopic studies confirmed that the synergistic effect of catalyst identity and reaction media changes the reaction mechanism of each catalyst. The WOR performance of 1&#8211;6 was tunable through ligand electronics and solvent effects, with the log(TOF)&#8722;&#951; analysis highlighting an operational &#951; as low as 40&#8197;mV. This study provides valuable insights into optimizing WOR catalysis through molecular design and environmental tuning.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Dependent C(sp3)&#8722;CF3 Reductive Elimination from Neutral Four&#8208;Coordinate Cu(III) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 10, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two distinct pathways for C(sp3)&#8722;CF3 bond&#8208;forming reductive elimination from a well&#8208;defined neutral 4&#8208;coordinate Cu(III) complex were identified. In medium polar solvent DCE, the reaction occurs mainly via a concerted bond&#8208;break/bond formation pathway, while in polar solvent DMF, the reaction proceeds via a rate&#8208;determining ligand dissociation pathway.







Abstract
A solvent dependent C(sp3)&#8722;CF3 bond&#8208;forming reductive elimination from neutral four&#8208;coordinate Cu(III) complexes [(L)CuIII(CF3)2(CH2CO2tBu)] (L=pyridine or its derivatives) is described. Reactions in less polar solvent ClCH2CH2Cl proceed via a concerted bond breaking/bond forming process along with the reorientation of the ligand, while reaction in polar solvent DMF occurs via a rate limiting ligand&#8208;dissociation, followed by C(sp3)&#8722;CF3 reductive elimination from the resulting three&#8208;coordinate intermediate. These mechanistic proposals are supported by kinetic studies that included ligand and temperature effects, as well as DFT calculations.

We pioneered a one&#8208;step synthesis of sheets S&#8722;Cu/Co&#8208;g&#8208;C3N4 dual single&#8208;atom by employing folding fan&#8208;shaped aluminum foil as a template, wherein Cu and Co single atoms were stabilized on g&#8208;C3N4 via N coordination. Subsequently, it was verified that the as&#8208;synthesized S&#8722;Cu/Co&#8208;g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;1:1 exhibited an excellent catalytic effect in the epoxidation of styrene.







Abstract
Dual single&#8208;atom catalysts have attracted considerable research interest due to their higher metal atom loading and more flexible active sites compared to single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). We pioneered the one&#8208;step synthesis of sheets copper&#8208;cobalt graphitic carbon nitride dual single&#8208;atom (S&#8722;Cu/Co&#8208;g&#8208;C3N4) using folding fan&#8208;shaped aluminum foil as a template, and used them as catalysts in the epoxidation of styrene respectively. Through XAFS (X&#8208;ray Absorption Fine Structure) and other characterizations, it is found that Cu and Co single atoms are stabilized separately on g&#8208;C3N4 via coordination with nitrogen (N), hindered the ordered growth of sheets, and formed more pore structures, which not only increased more catalytically active sites, but also effectively prevented the flakes re&#8208;aggregate during the catalytic process. And the synergistic effect between Cu and Co changes the energy band structure of the material and facilitates electron transfer during catalysis, hence an excellent catalytic effect of 89&#8201;% styrene conversion and 85&#8201;% styrene oxide selectivity was achieved when S&#8722;Cu/Co&#8208;g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;1&#8201;:&#8201;1 was applied in the epoxidation of styrene. Furthermore, the mechanisms of the epoxidation of styrene with S&#8722;Cu/Co&#8208;g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;1&#8201;:&#8201;1 was probed by the density functional theory (DFT) based on the slab model.

We developed, for the first time, reusable, efficient ligand&#8208;free iron&#8208;copper catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction involving a variety of aryl, heteroaryl halides (including chlorides, bromides, and iodides), and alkyl bromides with diverse aryl and aliphatic primary amides, conducted under solvent&#8208;minimized conditions. This economically competitive protocol offered the corresponding cross&#8208;coupling products, N&#8208;arylamides and N&#8208;alkylamides, in good to excellent yields with broad substrate scope (65 examples) and tolerance to several sensitive functionalities. A series of experiments, XPS, UV, CV, EPR, XRD, and radical clock experiments were performed to investigate the reaction mechanism. Furthermore, the in&#8208;vitro. study of synthesized products 3&#8201;ii, 3&#8201;xii, and 3&#8201;xxxx exhibited promising antibacterial and anticancer activities (MTT and Molecular Docking).







Abstract
We present, for the first time, an efficient ligand&#8208;free iron&#8208;copper catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction involving a variety of aryl, heteroaryl halides (including chlorides, bromides, and iodides), and alkyl bromides with diverse aryl and aliphatic primary amides, conducted under solvent&#8208;minimized conditions. This economically competitive protocol successfully yielded the corresponding cross&#8208;coupling products, N&#8208;arylamides and N&#8208;alkylamides, in good to excellent yields with broad substrate scope (65 examples) and tolerance to several sensitive functionalities (including heterocycles). No conventional work&#8208;up is required for this protocol, and the developed method is applicable for gram&#8208;scale synthesis. Notably, the catalyst is inexpensive, environmentally friendly, and can be reused at least four times with minimal loss of catalytic activity. A series of experiments, including X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry (CV), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) were conducted to identify the oxidation state of active catalytic species and radical clock experiment was performed using a radical probe to investigate the reaction mechanism. Furthermore, we evaluated the antibacterial and anticancer properties of selected synthesized products (3&#8201;ii, 3&#8201;xii, and 3&#8201;xxxx) in&#8208;vitro. The results indicated that the prepared compounds exhibited promising antibacterial and anticancer activities (MTT and Molecular Docking).

         <title>Structures of Gas&#8208;Phase Hydrated Phosphotyrosine Revealed by Soft X&#8208;ray Action Spectroscopy</title>

Gas&#8208;phase near&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption mass spectrometry (NEXAMS) reveals the effects of a single water molecule on protonated phosphotyrosine at the carbon and oxygen K&#8208;edges. The water molecule bonds with the phosphate group, altering the spectral features. Comparisons with density functional theory calculations identify three potential hydrated structures.







Abstract
Gas&#8208;phase near&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption mass spectrometry (NEXAMS) was employed at the carbon and oxygen K&#8208;edges to probe the influence of a single water molecule on the protonated phosphotyrosine molecule. The results of the photodissociation experiments revealed that the water molecule forms two bonds, with the phosphate group and another chemical group. By comparing the NEXAMS spectra at the carbon and oxygen K&#8208;edges with density functional theory calculations, we attributed the electronic transitions responsible for the observed resonances, especially the transitions due to the presence of the water molecule. We showed that the water molecule leads to a specific spectral feature in the partial ion yield of hydrated fragments at 536.4&#8197;eV. Moreover, comparing the NEXAMS spectra with the calculated structures allowed us to identify three possible structures for singly hydrated phosphotyrosine that agree with the observed fragmentation and resonances.

         <title>Scalable Bulk Synthesis of Phase&#8208;Pure &#947;&#8208;Sn3N4 as a Model for an Argon&#8208;Flow&#8208;Mediated Metathesis Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 10, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phase&#8208;pure, crystalline &#947;&#8208;Sn3N4 was synthesized via reaction of argon&#8208;diluted SnCl4 with Mg3N2. The exothermic nature of the reaction is controlled by slow mixing of the starting materials with a continuous flow of argon. The reaction can be further facilitated by the use of a tin flux. This new method not only leads to pure &#947;&#8208;Sn3N4 material, but is also promising for the synthesis of other nitride materials.







Abstract
Nitrides represent a promising class of materials for a variety of applications. However, bulk synthesis remains a challenging task due to the stability of the N2 molecule. In this study, we introduce a simple and scalable approach for synthesizing nitride bulk materials. Moderate reaction temperatures are achieved by using reactive starting materials, slow and continuous mixing of the starting materials, and by dissipating heat generated during the reaction. The impact on the synthesis of using different starting materials as nitrogen source and the influence of a flux were examined. &#947;&#8208;Sn3N4 was selected as the model compound. The synthesis of pure &#947;&#8208;Sn3N4 bulk material on a large scale has still been a challenge, although a few synthesis methods were already described in the literature. Here we synthesized &#947;&#8208;Sn3N4 by metathesis reaction of argon&#8208;diluted SnCl4 with Li3N, Mg3N2 or Ca3N2 as nitrogen sources. Products were characterized by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy, dynamic flash combustion analysis, hot gas extraction analysis, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption and emission spectroscopy. Additionally, single&#8208;crystal diffraction data of &#947;&#8208;Sn&#8323;N&#8324;, previously unavailable, were successfully collected.

         <title>Electrochemical Deconstruction of Waste Polyvinylidene Chloride (PVDC) to Value&#8208;Added Products in Batch and Flow</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 10, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical deconstruction of polyvinylidene chloride produces value&#8208;added chemicals and provides a solution to recycle halogenated polymers. The inevitable challenges, e.&#8201;g., high chlorine content and facile release of HCl, are found advantageous in the present strategy, which was further translated to flow at a 6.0&#8197;mmol scale. Chlorinated compounds were produced with high efficiency, together with a very high degree of dechlorination (98&#8201;%).







Abstract
Chlorinated polymers have made enormous contributions to materials science and are commercially produced on a large scale. These chlorinated polymers could be recycled as chlorine sources to efficiently produce valuable chlorinated compounds owing to their facile release of HCl. Although the thermal stability of PVDC is low compared to PVC, this can be advantageous in terms of easy and fast dehydrochlorination. Herein, we report an efficient electrochemical chlorination using poly(vinylidene chloride) (PVDC) as a chlorine source that works in an undivided cell and applies to a good number of examples. This method works on commodity polymers such as waste PVDC&#8208;PVC pharma blister film, PVDC&#8208;PO multilayer food packaging, and compression molded sheets of Ixan PVDC (with heat stabilizer) with similar efficiency. Furthermore, this method also provides the dechlorination of PVDC up to 98&#8201;%, leading to unsaturated dechlorinated material. Converting PVDC into more stable unsaturated compounds, the release of harmful chlorine&#8208;containing gases during incineration can be minimized. Additionally, this method is not only restricted to batch processes but an electroflow process for PVDC dechlorination and electrosynthesis has also been demonstrated.

A preorganized pyrazolate&#8208;based dinickel(II) platform is used to host an end&#8208;on P&#8208;bridging PCO&#8722; exhibiting fluxionality within the bimetallic pocket. Combined experimental and DFT studies reveal the mechanistic and thermodynamic landscape for nucleophilic attack at the phosphaketene&#8208;C or &#8208;P atoms, demonstrating the versatility of the PCO&#8722; synthon and suggesting possible control strategies for its selective transformations.







Abstract
Salt metathesis of dinickel(II) complex LNi2Br (1; L is a dinucleating pyrazolate ligand with two &#946;&#8208;diketiminato chelate arms) with Na(OCP)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(dioxane)2.5 yielded LNi2(PCO) (2) with a P&#8208;bridging phosphaethynolate. Further reaction of 2 with benzyl isocyanide or with an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) triggered decarbonylation and gave LNi2(PCN&#8208;CH2Ph) (3) and LNi2P(NHC) (4) with P&#8208;bridging cyanophosphide and NHC&#8208;phosphinidenide, respectively. Electronic structure analysis indicated a &#956;2&#8208;&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;1 binding mode of the PCO&#8722; anion between the two NiII ions in 2, which is even more pronounced for the [PCN(&#8722;CH2Ph)]&#8722; anion in 3. DFT assessment of the formation mechanism of 4 showed that attack at the phosphaketene&#8208;C atom is kinetically preferred but reversible and unproductive, while kinetically more demanding back&#8208;side SN2 attack at the phosphaketene&#8208;P atom triggers CO release with 4 as thermodynamic product. Nucleophilic addition at the phosphaketene&#8208;C could be demonstrated by the strongly exergonic reaction of 2 with KPPh2, giving unstable K[LNi2(P(O)CPPh2)] (5) with a P&#8208;bridging and K+&#8208;stabilized diphosphaurea derivative. All new complexes 2&#8211;5 have been comprehensively characterized, including by X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Critical Evaluation of Childs Method for the NMR Spectroscopic Scaling of Effective Lewis Acidity: Limitations and Resolution of Earlier Discrepancies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 10, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper evaluates trans&#8208;crotonaldehyde, Childs Method, as a probe to scale effective Lewis acidity by experimental and computational means. The restriction of the binding equilibrium results in an underestimation of effective Lewis acidity. Solvent effects and potential anisotropy effects cause secondary interaction, which yield misleading conclusions and assumptions.







Abstract
Quantifying Lewis acidity is essential for understanding and optimizing the performance of Lewis acids in diverse applications. Next to the widely accepted Gutmann&#8208;Beckett (GB) method, using triethyl phosphine oxide (TEPO) as a probe, the Childs method&#8212;employing trans&#8208;crotonaldehyde (TCA)&#8212;gained attention as an NMR&#8208;based technique for measuring effective Lewis acidity (eLA). Despite its steady use, the robustness of Childs method and its correlation with other measures remain underexplored. Previous comparisons between the GB and Childs scales revealed significant discrepancies, suggesting that hard and soft acid/base (HSAB) characteristics may be operative. In this study, we compare thermodynamic data for TCA binding to 117 Lewis acids (representing global Lewis acidity, gLA) with their corresponding NMR&#8208;induced chemical shifts in TCA. Our findings showcase notable deviations that reinforce key distinctions between eLA and gLA perspectives. Moreover, we identify significant limitations in the Childs method. First, the weak donor strength of TCA limits its applicability to only the strongest Lewis acids. Second, the exposed protons of TCA are prone to secondary interactions, obscuring the measurement of true Lewis acidity. Finally, our analysis reconciles discrepancies, refuting earlier assumptions that these arise from HSAB effects.

Dehydrogenation using Reusable Ni&#8208;immobilized MOF catalyst: Herein, we have demonstrated synthesis of a novel Ni&#8208;immobilized MOF as heterogeneous catalyst for the dehydrogenation of N&#8208;heterocycles. A series of five and six&#8208;membered N&#8208;heteroarenes were synthesized in up to 98&#8201;% yield (&gt;33 examples). Synthesis of pharmaceuticals were obtained under milder reactions conditions. Detailed characterization of the fresh catalyst and reused catalyst were performed using SEM, TEM, BET, PXRD, and EDX elemental mappings. The catalyst could be recycled up to four&#8208;times, mechanistic studies were performed including detection of H2 and H2O2 and suggested the involvement of enamine&#8208;imine intermediate species for sequential dehydrogenation.







Abstract
Herein, we have demonstrated the design and synthesis of a novel Ni&#8208;immobilized MOF as heterogeneous catalyst for the dehydrogenation of N&#8208;heterocycles. A series of five and six&#8208;membered N&#8208;heteroarenes bearing one or more heteroatoms were synthesized in up to 98&#8201;% yield (&gt;33 examples). Late stage functionalization to the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;glucuronides inhibitor, antimalarial drug quinine, and the nonsteroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug (NSAID) indomethacin were obtained under milder reactions conditions. A series of mechanistic studies revealed the detection of H2 and H2O2 during the progress of the reactions and suggested the involvement of enamine&#8208;imine intermediate species for sequential dehydrogenation. Detailed characterization of the fresh catalyst and reused catalyst were performed using SEM, TEM, BET, PXRD, and EDX elemental mappings. The catalyst could be recycled up to four&#8208;times without much loss in catalytic activities. In&#8208;situ formed defects, pore size enlargement and additional Lewis acid sites within catalyst nanocrystals assisted in attaining high activity and selectivity to N&#8208;heteroarenes.

A highly diastereo&#8208; and enatioselective Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acid catalyzed synthesis of densely substituted spiroisoindolinones from enamides and 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;isoindolinones is described. This method enables the synthesis of spiroisoindolinones with three contiguous stereogenic centers in high yields (up to 97&#8201;%) diastereoselectivities (up to &gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;&lt;2&#8201;:&#8201;0&#8201;:&#8201;0&#8197;dr) and enantioselectivities (up to &gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;&lt;2 e.r.) under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
A highly stereoselective Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acid catalyzed synthesis of densely substituted spiroisoindolinones from enamides and 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;isoindolinones is described. With simple Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acids, such as para&#8208;toluene sulfonic acid, spiroisoindolinones with three contiguous stereogenic centers are formed in high yields (up to 97&#8201;%) and diastereoselectivities (up to &gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;&lt;2&#8201;:&#8201;0&#8201;:&#8201;0&#8197;dr) under mild reaction conditions. With the use of a chiral phosphoric acid catalyst, a diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective synthesis of the corresponding spiroisoindolinones was achieved. Mechanistic investigations indicate a step&#8208;wise mechanism via an initial addition of the enamide to an electrophilic N&#8208;acylimine species followed by an intramolecular aza&#8208;Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction. Addition of a strong Lewis acid can be used to facilitate the second step for less reactive substrates.

         <title>The Impact of Single Amino Acid Insertion on the Supramolecular Assembly Pathway of Aromatic Peptide Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 10, February 17, 2025. </description>

Elucidating supramolecular polymerization mechanisms is crucial for designing customizable supramolecular biomaterials. Here we investigate supramolecular assembly of Fmoc&#8208;L2QG with unusual concentration&#8208;dependent assembly, forming fibrous assemblies at low concentrations and metastable supramolecular droplets via liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation at higher concentrations. Inserting just one leucine unit in Fmoc&#8208;L3QG leads to competing assembly pathways, but formation of fibrous morphologies regardless of concentration.







Abstract
Understanding the mechanism of self&#8208;assembly driven by non&#8208;covalent interactions is crucial for designing supramolecular materials with desired properties. Here we investigate the self&#8208;assembly of aromatic peptide amphiphiles, Fmoc&#8208;L2QG and Fmoc&#8208;L3QG using a combination of spectroscopic, transmission electron and superresolution optical microscopy techniques. Our results show that Fmoc&#8208;L2QG leads to concentration&#8208;dependent assembly, forming fibrous assemblies at low concentrations and supramolecular droplets via liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) at higher concentrations. Mechanical activation using for example ultrasonication triggered the transition from metastable droplets to fibre morphologies of Fmoc&#8208;L2QG. In contrast, Fmoc&#8208;L3QG followed both on&#8208;pathway and off&#8208;pathway routes, resulting in the formation of fibrous morphologies regardless of concentration. Seeding experiments revealed that homo&#8208;seeds of the same peptide sequence accelerated the on&#8208;pathway process, while hetero&#8208;seeds of a mismatched peptide sequences accelerated the off&#8208;pathway process, highlighting the competing nature of the complex assembly profile. These findings demonstrate the significant impact of single amino acid insertion on the supramolecular assembly process of oligopeptide monomers, and highlight the potential for controlling the structure and dynamics of peptide materials. Pathway engineering of oligopeptide building blocks and multidomain supramolecular monomers will open new avenues in tailor&#8208;made and customizable supramolecular biomaterials.

         <title>B(C6F5)3&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent Thioetherifications of Alkenes via Thiiranium Intermediates: Experimental and Computational Insights</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 10, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates a substitution&#8208;controlled regiodivergent thioetherification of di&#8208; and trisubstituted alkenes, using 10&#8197;mol&#8201;% B(C6F5)3 as a metal&#8208;free catalyst and N&#8208;thiosuccinimide as a sulfenylating agent. The method provides efficient Csp2&#8722;H and Csp3&#8722;S sulfenylation products with high yields, along with diphenylvinylsulfides with AIE properties used for OLEDs, sensors, and imaging, and allylic thioethers. DFT analysis reveals a thiiranium&#8208;ion&#8208;mediated mechanism.







Abstract
Precise control of selective alkene functionalization is a continuing challenge in the chemical community. In this study, we develop a substitution&#8208;controlled regiodivergent thioetherification of di&#8208; or trisubstituted alkenes using 10&#8197;mol&#8201;% tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C6F5)3] as a catalyst and N&#8208;thiosuccinimide as a sulfenylating reagent. This metal&#8208;free borane catalyzed C&#8722;S bond forming method is utilized for a Csp2&#8722;H sulfenylation reaction to synthesize an array of diphenylvinylsulfide derivatives with good to excellent yields (25 examples, up to 91&#8201;% yield). Some of the products exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen properties used in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), chemical sensors, and biological imaging units. Depending upon the starting alkene, Csp3&#8722;S sulfenylation products could also be generated regioselectively. A variety of allylic thioethers from &#945;&#8208;alkyl substituted styrenes were isolable in good yields and selectivities (14 examples, up to 67&#8201;% yield). The DFT&#8208;supported mechanistic study confirms that the reaction proceeds via a thiiranium ion intermediate, where the regioselectivity and product formation is determined by the alkene substituents which influence the activation barriers and energy profiles. Diphenylvinylsulfide derivatives can also be efficiently transformed into a range of synthetically valuable compounds, including vinyl sulfoxides, vinyl sulfones, and vinyl sulfoximines.

         <title>Luminescent Mechanochromism of a Platinum Complex with Four Monodentate Ligands Governed by Intramolecular Interactions Between Ligands</title>

         <dc:description>
Luminescence mechanochromism of a platinum complex bearing four monodentate ligands is investigated. This platinum complex has two distinctly emissive polymorphs: a blue&#8208;emissive polymorph with low intensity and a brightly green&#8208;emissive polymorph. Upon mechanical stimulation, the blue&#8208;emitting phase is converted to green&#8208;emitting powder through a crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal phase transition. Structural analyses indicate that intramolecular interactions between ligands control the phase&#8208;transition behavior.

         <title>Systematic Investigations of the Solid Solution Zr(V1&#8211;xAlx)2 Adopting the Laves Phase Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 10, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigations of the ternary system Zr&#8211;V&#8211;Al show that no superstructures can be observed within the solid solution Zr(V1&#8211;xAlx)2. For high values of x the hexagonal MgZn2 type structure is found while low values lead to the cubic MgCu2 type. 27Al MAS NMR investigations confirm the absence of ordered superstructures.







Abstract
Laves phases are an interesting field of research when it comes to structural chemistry and physical properties. Investigations of the ternary system Zr&#8211;V&#8722;Al showed, in contrast to the system Hf&#8211;V&#8722;Al, that no superstructures can be observed within the solid solution Zr(V1&#8211;xAlx)2. High values of x form aluminum rich phases that adopt the hexagonal MgZn2 type structure while low values of x lead to vanadium rich phases that adopt the cubic MgCu2 type. All samples were investigated by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments. Single crystal studies indicated that no superstructure formation is present in the investigated samples. 27Al MAS NMR investigations confirmed these findings. For ZrAl2, quantum&#8208;chemical calculations helped with the analysis of the 27Al NMR spectrum of the binary endmember of the solid solution. Some of the prepared samples were investigated with respect to their magnetic properties. The investigated compounds show Pauli&#8208;paramagnetism, in Zr(V0.875Al0.125)2 in addition superconductivity with a critical temperature of TC=4.17(1)&#8197;K was observed. Investigations of compositions that do not belong to the Laves phase regime clearly indicate that the MgZn2 type structure is still the dominant phase. Regardless of the starting composition chosen, the hexagonal Laves phase was mostly present.

         <title>Nickel/Photoredox Catalyzed Aryl&#8208;Alkyl Cross&#8208;Coupling with Alkyl Boronic Esters as Radical Precursors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 10, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We disclosed that activation of alkyl boronic esters by MeOLi is highly efficient for the generation of alkyl radicals under photocatalysis conditions. This strategy was successfully applied to nickel/photoredox dual&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) coupling of aryl halides with alkyl boronic esters. Mechanistic experiments such as radical trapping experiments, stoichiometric Ar&#8722;Ni(II)&#8208;X mediated or Ar&#8722;Ni(II)&#8208;X, Ni(I)&#8208;X or Ni(0) catalyzed reactions, fluorescence quenching experiments etc. were performed. DFT calculations indicated that the cross&#8208;coupling likely proceeds via a Ni(I)&#8208;catalyzed pathway. In addition, the method can also be extended to alkyl boronic acids.







Abstract
Nickel/photoredox dual catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of aryl halides with alkylboron compounds is one of the effective methodologies for the construction of C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds. Although elegant results have been achieved by using alkyl trifluoroborates as alkyl radical precursors, the generation of alkyl radicals from readily available alkyl boronic esters is still limited due to their high oxidation potential. We disclosed here that activation of alkyl boronic esters by MeOLi is highly efficient for the generation of alkyl radicals under photocatalysis conditions. The reaction featured with a wide substrate scope, high functional group tolerance, and late&#8208;stage modification of bioactive substances. In addition, the method was also successfully extended to alkyl boronic acids. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies indicated that the cross&#8208;coupling likely proceeds via a Ni(I)&#8208;catalyzed pathway.

         <title>Structures, Chiroptical Properties, and Unexpectedly Facile Helical Inversion of Highly Elongated Anthracene&#8208;Fused Expanded Helicenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 10, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coiling up fused anthracenes with more than two helical turns enabled us to resolve the enantiomers, which showed high CD and CPL activities. Even though the helical structures were considerably elongated, enantiomerization via helical inversion occurred more readily than that expected from a rigid molecular model.







Abstract
Helical fused anthracenes were elongated by fusing additional aromatic units at both ends to yield novel expanded helicenes. Compounds [5]HA2N and [7]HA consisting of 19 and 21 benzene rings, respectively, were synthesized by fourfold cycloisomerization of the corresponding terminal alkyne precursors. The helical structures were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, where the aromatic frameworks stacked effectively with the helical turn numbers exceeding two. The enantiomers of the two compounds were resolved by chiral HPLC. Whereas [5]HA2N readily underwent enantiomerization at room temperature at the barrier to enantiomerization of 91&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1, the barrier was enhanced to 99&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for the long analog [7]HA. The enantiomers of [7]HA exhibited strong responses in the circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectra, as scaled by dissymmetry factors |gabs|=0.034 and |glum|=0.012. Theoretical calculations by the r2SCAN&#8208;3c method suggested stepwise mechanisms for the enantiomerization via helical inversion with acceptable barrier heights. The unexpectedly flexible nature of the aromatic frameworks of [5]HA2N and [7]HA was discussed on the basis of the proposed mechanism.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed O&#8208;Arylation of N&#8208;Protected Amino Alcohols with (Hetero)aryl Chlorides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 10, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first effective base metal&#8208;catalyzed protocol for C&#8722;O cross&#8208;coupling of primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohol&#8208;containing N&#8208;Boc protected amino alcohols with (hetero)aryl chlorides, affording access to new and useful N&#8208;protected aryloxyamine compounds, is reported.







Abstract
The aryloxyamine motif is a prominent pharmacophore in drug design and development. While these biologically relevant structures could in principle be sustainably assembled from the base metal&#8208;catalyzed O&#8208;arylation of inexpensive and abundant amino alcohols with (hetero)aryl chlorides, reports of such challenging C&#8722;O bond formations with useful scope are lacking. In response, we report herein the hitherto unknown Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;O cross&#8208;coupling of N&#8208;protected amino alcohols (primary, secondary, and tertiary) with (hetero)aryl chlorides. Also presented are chemoselective sequential/telescoped C&#8722;N and C&#8722;O cross&#8208;couplings of the unprotected amino alcohol prolinol to afford an unsymmetrical diarylated product.

         <title>Nitride Zeolites from Ammonothermal Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 10, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrothermal synthesis of oxide zeolites is a commonly used procedure. As exchanging oxide ions by nitride ions is very promising for interesting material properties, we present the successful ammonothermal synthesis of some nitride zeolites using supercritical ammonia. The employed mineralizers have a major influence on the reaction outcome which can be utilized to control the formation of phase&#8208;pure products.







Abstract
Oxide zeolites are synthesized from aqueous solutions in an established way employing hydrothermal synthesis. Transferring this approach to nitride zeolites requires a solvent providing nitrogen for which ammonia has proven to be particularly suitable. We present the successful ammonothermal synthesis of the (oxo)nitridosilicate compounds Ce3[Si6N11], Li2RE4[Si4N8]O3 (RE=La, Ce) and K1.25Ce7.75[Si11N21O2]O0.75. Within this procedure, the usage of supercritical ammonia as a solvent as well as the utilization of the mineralizers NaN3, Li3N and KN3, respectively, allowed the targeted synthesis of large single crystals. Formation of these (oxo)nitridosilicates depends mainly on the employed mineralizer despite their similar degree of condensation. The three compounds were structurally characterized using X&#8208;ray diffraction and their crystal structures contain a wide range of different ring sizes within their tetrahedra networks. The zeolite(&#8208;like) crystal structures are elucidated and compared to known nitridosilicate representatives of the respective structure types. Their elemental composition was investigated using energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray (EDX) spectroscopy and incorporation of the O rather than N&#8722;H functionality was confirmed by Fourier&#8208;Transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy as well as by charge distribution (CHARDI) and bond valence sum (BVS) calculations. The presented examples demonstrate that ammonothermal synthesis provides a one&#8208;step access from elemental starting materials towards nitride zeolites.

Reactions of [(2,6&#8208;Dipp2C6H3)Sn(&#956;&#8208;H)]2 (Dipp=2,6&#8208;i&#8208;Pr2C6H3) with [(BDI)AeH]2 (BDI=HC{(Me)CNDipp}2; Ae=Mg, Ca) provide heterobimetallic bis&#8208;&#956;2&#8208;hydrido species, [[(BDI)Ae&#8208;&#956;&#8208;(H)2&#8208;Sn(C6H3&#8208;2,6&#8208;Dipp2)]. Although both compounds react with hex&#8208;1&#8208;ene to provide alkaline earth derivatives of tetravalent organostannides, the magnesium reagent promotes twofold addition of the alkene whereas the calcium&#8208;based reaction is arrested after a single hydrostannylation event.







Abstract
Reactions of a m&#8208;terphenylhydridostannylene with &#946;&#8208;diketiminato magnesium and calcium hydrides provide bis&#8208;&#956;2&#8208;hydrido species, the heterobimetallic constitutions of which are maintained after the addition of THF donor solvent. In both cases, reactions with hex&#8208;1&#8208;ene result in the formation of tetravalent organostannyl alkaline earth derivatives. Whereas the magnesium reagent undergoes facile twofold addition, the calcium&#8208;centered process is arrested after a single alkene reduction event. This contrasting behavior is assessed to result from the heavier alkaline earth element's ability to form a persistent polyhapto interaction with an arene substituent of the m&#8208;terphenyl ligand.

Dual site borane capture into the Fe&#8722;N bonds of 1,3&#8208;N,S&#8208;chelated iron complex, [(dppe)Fe{&#954;2&#8208;N,S&#8208;(mp)}2], leads to isolation of a rare example of dimeric bis(dihydridoborate) complex, [Fe{k3&#8208;S,H,H&#8208;(H3B(mp))}2]2. This dinuclear complex exists as a pair of enantiomers, in which the iron centres are hepta&#8208;coordinated and comprise fourfold five&#8208;membered [Fe&#8722;B&#8722;NCS] heterocycles with k3&#8208;S,H,H coordination modes (see picture).







Abstract
In our effort to establish a direct synthetic approach for bis(dihydridoborate) complexes of first&#8208;row transition metals, we have investigated the reactivity of [Cp*Fe(dppe)Cl] (dppe =1,2&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane) with Na[BH3L] (L =2&#8208;mercaptopyridine (mp) and 2&#8208;mercaptobenzothiazole (mbz)) that led to the formation of iron(II) dihydridoborate complexes, [Cp*Fe{&#954;3&#8208;S,H,H&#8208;(H2BH(L))}] 1&#8201;a&#8208;b (L=mp (1&#8201;a) and L=mbz (1&#8201;b)). Further, in an attempt to isolate the bis(dihydridoborate) complex of iron by the insertion of borane into the &#954;2&#8208;N,S&#8208;chelated iron complex, [(dppe)Fe{&#954;2&#8208;N,S&#8208;(mp)}2] (2), we have isolated and structurally characterized a rare example of dimeric iron bis(dihydridoborate) complex, [Fe{&#954;3&#8208;S,H,H&#8208;(H2BH(mp))}2]2, &#923;&#916;/&#916;&#923;&#8208;3 as pair of enantiomers. Interestingly, these enantiomers &#923;&#916;/&#916;&#923;&#8208;3 have two trans&#8208;[Fe{&#954;3&#8208;S,H,H&#8208;(H2BH(mp))}2] moieties bridged through sulfur atoms of 2&#8208;mercaptopyridinyl ligands, where the iron centres are hepta&#8208;coordinated. The natural bond&#8208;orbital (NBO) analyses of &#923;&#916;&#8208;3 and &#916;&#923;&#8208;3 show considerable electron donation from the filled &#963;B&#8208;H bonding orbital to vacant

         <title>Enabling High&#8208;Performance Multi&#8208;Resonant TADF Emitters via Intramolecular Hydrogen Bond</title>

Green OLED based on BN&#8208;2Pm demonstrates EQEmax of 36.5% with CIE coordinates of (0.18, 0.71), while device employing BN&#8208;5Pm as emitting layer exhibits EQEmax of 14.6% with CIE coordinates of (0.12, 0.57). The magic difference in luminescence between the two isomers lies in the presence of intramolecular hydrogen bond.







Abstract
Hydrogen bonds (HBs), prevalent strong interactions in organic compounds, can effectively constrain single bond rotation, leading to rigid planar configurations. This rigidity enhances emission efficiency and narrows the emission spectrum of luminescent materials. Recent advances have leveraged HBs to advance high&#8208;performance donor&#8208;acceptor thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials. However, their application in multi&#8208;resonance (MR) TADF emitters remains limited. We herein developed MR&#8208;TADF emitters incorporating intramolecular hydrogen bonds (IHBs) with pyrimidine as the HB acceptor. The rigid planar conformation induced by IHBs significantly improved photoluminescence quantum yield, extended emission wavelength, reduced full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum, and decreased non&#8208;radiative decay rates for BN&#8208;2Pm compared to BN&#8208;5Pm. Devices based on BN&#8208;2Pm achieved a maximum external quantum efficiency of 36.5&#8201;%, a current efficiency of 102.3&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1, a power efficiency of 84.6&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1, and Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.18, 0.71). In contrast, BN&#8208;5Pm exhibited lower values: 14.6&#8201;%, 36.8&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1, 27.6&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1, and (0.12, 0.57), respectively.

         <title>Bioinspired Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Hunterine A: Deciphering the Key Step in the Biogenetic Pathway</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 10, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise, bioinspired, and enantioselective synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;hunterine A, an unusual 6/7/6/6/5 pentacyclic natural compound, is reported through an aspidosperma precursor, employing a late&#8208;stage skeletal rearrangement. Our investigation delineates the potential mechanism and stereochemical elements governing the involved skeletal rearrangement, providing insight into the likely biosynthetic origin of (&#8722;)&#8208;hunterine A.







Abstract
A concise, bioinspired, and enantioselective synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;hunterine A, an odd 6/7/6/6/5 pentacyclic natural product, is described. The key step in the synthesis of this complex structure is an interim&#8208;template directed 6&#8208;exo selective epoxide ring&#8208;opening reaction, which is interwoven with a hydrolysis step of the indolenine hemiaminal template to create the unusual 7&#8208;membered azepine bridge motif.

     alt="Bioinspired Synthesis of (&#8722;)-Hunterine A: Deciphering the Key Step in the Biogenetic Pathway"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A concise, bioinspired, and enantioselective synthesis of (&#8722;)-hunterine A, an unusual 6/7/6/6/5 pentacyclic natural compound, is reported through an aspidosperma precursor, employing a late-stage skeletal rearrangement. Our investigation delineates the potential mechanism and stereochemical elements governing the involved skeletal rearrangement, providing insight into the likely biosynthetic origin of (&#8722;)-hunterine A.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A concise, bioinspired, and enantioselective synthesis of (&#8722;)-hunterine A, an odd 6/7/6/6/5 pentacyclic natural product, is described. The key step in the synthesis of this complex structure is an interim-template directed 6-exo selective epoxide ring-opening reaction, which is interwoven with a hydrolysis step of the indolenine hemiaminal template to create the unusual 7-membered azepine bridge motif. Our work not only refines the previously proposed biogenetic pathway, but also reveals the possible stereochemical prerequisite of the unique skeletal rearrangement, which provides a vantage point for understanding how (&#8722;)-hunterine A is likely to be generated in nature.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Optoelectronic Properties and Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Application of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Dyads Derived From 2,6&#8208;DicarboxyBODIPY</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 10, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized BODIPY dyes with benzyl ester and carboxylic acid groups, showing charge transfer, polarity&#8208;dependent triplet state formation, and pH&#8208;dependent emission. Fluorescence lifetime microscopy revealed distinct lifetime gradients in colon cancer cells and pig enteroids. These results highlight the potential of heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free BODIPYs as fluorescent probes for cancer and stem cell imaging.







Abstract
Donor&#8208;acceptor BODIPY dyads, functionalized at the 2 and 6 positions with benzyl ester (BDP&#8208;DE) or carboxylic acid (BDP&#8208;DA) groups, were synthesized, and their optoelectronic properties were investigated. Carbonyl groups were found to increase the reduction potential of the BODIPY core by 0.15&#8211;0.4&#8197;eV compared to regular alkyl&#8208;substituted BODIPYs. These compounds exhibited efficient intramolecular charge separation and triplet state formation through the spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC) process, achieving singlet oxygen quantum yields of up to 92&#8201;%, depending on the solvent polarity. Notably, the fluorescence and singlet oxygen generation of BDP&#8208;DAs were found to depend on the ionization state of the carboxylic groups. Time&#8208;resolved fluorescence measurements revealed that complexation of BDP&#8208;DAs with bovine serum albumine (BSA) significantly extended their excited state lifetimes. Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) studies of human colorectal carcinoma (HCT116) cells and pig small intestinal organoids (enteroids) provided insights into subcellular localization. The diacid with 2,4&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl group at the meso&#8208;position (DA1) displayed longer lifetimes in lipid&#8208;droplet&#8208;like structures and shorter lifetimes in cytoplasmic regions. The diacid containing a meso&#8208;anthracenyl group (DA2) formed &#8242;islands&#8217; in cell monolayers, exhibiting a distinct lifetime gradient from the periphery to the center. These results highlight the potential of donor&#8208;acceptor BODIPYs as fluorescent probes for biological imaging, particularly in revealing subtle differences in cellular environments.

Fluorinated Heterocycles A comprehensive study on the physicochemical properties of gem&#8208;difluorinated saturated O&#8208;heterocyclic substituents, as well as their non&#8208;fluorinated and carbocyclic counterparts is reported. The potential of the title fragments for bioisosteric replacements in medicinal chemistry is illustrated by the synthesis and evaluation of MAPK inhibitors &#8211; analogs of clinical candidate R&#8208;1487.







Abstract
A comprehensive study on the physicochemical properties of gem&#8208;fluorinated O&#8208;heterocyclic substituents is reported. Systematic additive effects of introducing O&#8208; and gem&#8208;CF2 group introduction on acidic properties (pKa) of the corresponding carboxylic acids/protonated primary amines were demonstrated. The impact of the O/CF2 moieties on lipophilicity (LogP) was found to be complex; significant mutual influence of the corresponding polar moieties governed the compound's overall properties in this case. Biological evaluation of MAPK kinase inhibitors incorporating the title substituents demonstrated their utility as promising fragments for bioisosteric replacements in drug discovery campaigns.

         <title>Front Cover: Optoelectronic Properties and Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Application of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Dyads Derived From 2,6&#8208;DicarboxyBODIPY (Chem. Eur. J. 10/2025)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 10, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover showcases donor&#8211;acceptor BODIPY dyads with carboxylic acid groups, which exhibit efficient charge separation and triplet state formation through spin&#8211;orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC). These dyes show potential as fluorescent probes for biological imaging, as their fluorescence lifetimes are influenced by the nature of the meso&#8208;aryl group, solvent polarity, and the ionization state of the carboxyl groups. The artwork depicts the application of fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) with the new dyes in cells and organoids, highlighting lifetime gradients in different cellular regions. Distinct lifetime gradient patterns were observed for dyes with 2,4&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl and anthracenyl groups, revealing subtle differences in cellular environments, as shown in the image. More information can be found in the Research Article by C. Bucher, R.&#8197;I. Dmitriev, M.&#8197;A. Filatov and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202404188).

The Cover Feature illustrates a study on hydrated phosphotyrosine in the gas phase. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202403665), J. Leroux, S. Bari and co&#8208;workers explain how, by combining synchrotron radiation tuned to the oxygen core&#8212;shell energy with tandem mass spectrometry, they identified the most favorable position adopted by a single water molecule on the protonated amino acid. Their integrated experimental and theoretical approach revealed that the water molecule bridges the phosphate and carboxyl groups, effectively stabilizing the overall structure.

         <dc:description>
An efficient, ligand&#8208;free, iron&#8211;copper&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction involving a variety of aryl, heteroaryl, and alkyl halides, with diverse aryl and aliphatic primary amides has been established under solvent&#8208;minimized conditions. This economically competitive protocol offered N&#8208;arylamides and N&#8208;alkylamides as cross&#8208;coupling products in good yields with broad substrate scope and tolerance to several sensitive functionalities. MTT and molecular docking showed the products to have promising antibacterial and anticancer activities. The two people navigating a boat symbolize the iron and copper catalysts that drive the coupling reaction under solvent&#8208;minimized conditions, aided by base, temperature, and a specific reaction time. The artificial cloud emerging from the product emphasizes the antibacterial and anticancer properties of the synthesized N&#8208;arylamides and N&#8208;alkylamides, which were studied in vitro. More information can be found in the Research Article by L. Adak and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202403649).

         <title>Spin&#8208;Frustrated Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 10, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin&#8208;frustrated metal&#8208;organic frameworks are an emerging class of materials due to their unique magnetic properties arising from the interplay between geometric and topological factors within the frameworks. This review highlights the fundamental aspects of spin frustration in metal&#8208;organic frameworks, synthetic protocols, structural characteristics, and potential applications.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are a fascinating class of structured materials with diverse functionality originating from their distinctive physicochemical properties. This review focuses on the specific chemical design of geometrically frustrated MOFs along with the origin of the intriguing magnetic properties. We have discussed the arrangement of spin centres (metal and ligand) which are responsible for the unusual magnetic phenomena in MOFs. Both two&#8208;dimensional (2D) and three&#8208;dimensional (3D) MOFs with frustrated magnetism, their synthetic routes, and evaluation of magnetic properties are highlighted. Such spin&#8208;frustrated MOFs may find applications in the field of memory devices, transistors, sensors, and the development of unconventional superconductors.

         <title>Crystal phase engineering of TiO2 for efficient photocatalytic non&#8208;oxidative methane coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic non&#8208;oxidative coupling of methane (NOCM) is an appealing approach to produce ethane and hydrogen, however, most developed photocatalysts still suffer from low activity. Here, we demonstrate that the crystal phase engineering of TiO2 via thermal annealing of Ti metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) can afford high photocatalytic NOCM performance in a flow reactor under UV&#8208;visible light irradiation. The characterization results show that engineering the TiO2 crystal phase can improve the separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers and promote the formation of &#8226;CH3 intermediate, thus achieving the improved performance of photocatalytic NOCM reaction. This research provides a new perspective towards the design and construction of efficient photocatalysts for NOCM reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>A Conjugated Porous Organic Polymer as a&#160;Metal&#8208;free Bifunctional Electrocatalyst for Enhanced Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A conjugated porous organic polymer (SMCOP&#8208;4) with imine linkage and triazine functional moiety was rationally designed and synthesized by an imine condensation reaction. The &#960;&#8208;conjugated network of SMCOP&#8208;4 facilitates electron mobility, enhancing electrochemical activity. Metal&#8208;free electrocatalyst SMCOP&#8208;4 shows superior performance for HER and OER with a low overpotential of 139 mV and 295 mV, respectively, at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 current density and with small Tafel slopes in alkaline electrolytes. Along with the low overpotential values, the electrocatalyst is highly stable at electrochemical conditions. Further, density functional theory calculations were carried out to identify the most active sites involved in catalyzing the HER and OER on the SMCOP&#8208;4 catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Visualization of Ferroptosis&#8208;Induced Lipid Peroxidation Using Plasma Membrane&#8208;Specific Fluorescent Probe LipoxPM</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play essential roles in cellular processes, but aberrant generation of ROS can damage lipids, proteins, and DNA leading to pathological events such as aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are especially susceptible to such oxidative stress. This ROS&#8208;induced lipid peroxidation is a key mediator of ferroptosis, an iron&#8208;dependent, non&#8208;apoptotic form of cell death. Although lipid peroxidation is recognized as a critical event in ferroptosis, current study tools for detecting the oxidation process have limited use due to a lack of specificity toward a particular membrane type such as plasma membrane. In this study, we present LipoxPM, a novel fluorescent probe that specifically targets lipid peroxidation in plasma membrane over other cellular membranes. LipoxPM features a BODIPY&#8208;based fluorophore and an anionic sulfonate group, enhancing selective accumulation in the plasma membrane. LipoxPM was able to detect ferroptosis&#8208;related lipid peroxidation in live cells, visualizing the spatial distribution of lipid peroxidation in the cell death processes. This new probe would enable study of unknown mechanisms of ferroptosis and could potentially facilitate development of therapeutic strategies targeting oxidative stress&#8208;related diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkali&#8208;Stable Cations and Anion Exchange Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anion exchange membranes (AEMs) based energy conversion and storage devices have attracted attention as an innovative technology due to their advantageous alkaline catalytic kinetics and cost&#8208;effectiveness. AEMs play a crucial role in these devices and have shown significant progress in terms of ionic conductivity, mechanical properties, alkaline stability, and other essential characteristics. Nevertheless, their durability remains a limiting factor preventing the large&#8208;scale deployment of AEMs based devices. The attack of hydroxide ions on the cations is an inherent issue that needs to be addressed to enhance the lifetime of the AEMs. Therefore, the design of more stable cationic groups is essential to maintain the initial properties of AEMs and extend the device lifetime. This concept systematically summarizes the development and stability enhancement strategies of the cationic groups for AEMs in recent years, with particular emphasis on the emerging cyclic cationic groups. Furthermore, the stability differences of cations in small molecules versus AEMs are systematically discussed, as well as prospective research toward stable AEMs.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Rigid Compounds to Enhance Selectivity for Carbonic Anhydrase IX</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

2&#8208;((2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;4&#8208;sulfamoylphenyl)sulfonyl)ethyl acetate can react with various amine nucleophiles to form 1,1 oxidized thiazines via &#946;&#8208;elimination and nucleophilic addition reactions followed by immediate aromatic nucleophilic substitution. Newly synthesized rigid sulfonamides bearing thiazine ring were tested against cancer&#8208;related carbonic anhydrase IX and showed improved selectivity over other isozymes.







Abstract
High affinity and selectivity for intended targets is an important goal of small molecule design in drug discovery, yet balancing molecular flexibility and rigidity remains a challenge. While flexible compounds can increase target affinity, they often result in non&#8208;specific interactions and reduced selectivity. In contrast, rigid compounds may recognize their target more precisely and have lower off&#8208;target effects. In this study, we incorporated a 1,1&#8208;dioxido&#8208;1,4&#8208;thiazine ring into fluorinated benzenesulfonamide derivatives with bulky meta&#8208;substituents to enhance selectivity for human carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX), an important cancer&#8208;associated target. Due to the structural similarities of CAIX with other carbonic anhydrase isozymes, selective inhibition remains a significant challenge. A series of 3,4&#8208;substituted trifluorobenzenesulfonamides containing oxidized thiazine rings were synthesized using a novel synthetic pathway. Although the potency against CAIX was modestly reduced compared to more flexible analogs, selectivity increased significantly, with lead compounds 7&#8201;d and 7&#8201;e exhibiting over 1000&#8208;fold selectivity for CAIX over most other isozymes. X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed the structural basis for this selectivity, confirming the advantageous positioning of rigidified compounds within some CA isozyme active sites. These findings highlight the potential of molecular rigidity in the design of highly selective inhibitors for therapeutic applications.

The graphics compare excited state dynamics of the SKG1 molecule in Toluene (green background) and Butanol (orange background). The Jablonski diagram illustrates the competition between reverse intersystem crossing (rISC) and internal conversion (3IC). In toluene, rISC occurs more rapidly, whereas, in polar butanol, 3IC dominates due to the larger energy gap between the Tn and S1 states.







Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) has recently emerged as a promising process with significant potential to advance organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) for display applications. The donor&#8208;acceptor system is a well&#8208;known molecular arrangement exhibiting TADF properties. However, our investigation into the chalcone&#8208;based donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A) system (SKG1) reveals that the en&#8208;one bridging unit in chalcone plays a crucial role in the reverse intersystem crossing (rISC) process and may be responsible for the existence of two conformational isomers. In stark contrast with the conventional endothermic TADF process, the designed molecule follows a down&#8208;converted cold rISC pathway that also from a higher&#8208;lying triplet (Tn) state to the lowest singlet (S1) state (in toluene) with remarkably short delayed fluorescence lifetime of 350&#8197;ns. Additionally, this rISC process is found to be sensitive to the polarity of the medium. The UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR transient absorption spectroscopy reveals an ultrafast intersystem crossing (ISC) process within &lt;100&#8197;ps and the involvement of higher lying triplet state in rISC process. This comprehensive research deepens the understanding of the rISC mechanism and paves the way for developing next&#8208;generation OLED materials using D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;based delayed emitters.

         <title>Narrow Bandgap Perovskite Enabled by Heterovalent Co&#8208;Doping for Visible&#8208;NIR Light Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

The 5&#8201;% Ag/Bi co&#8208;dopants with absorption edge up to 1300&#8197;nm, become one of the narrowest bandgap perovskite materials. The incorporation of Bi (p) orbitals is responsible for the band narrowing and the co&#8208;doping enhances antioxidation capability. When applied to CO2 photoreduction, the co&#8208;dopants achieved highly selective CO production performance, with an apparent quantum yield of 7.56&#8201;% at 700&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Metal halide perovskites have garnered significant attention due to their vast potential in various optoelectronic applications. While their tunable bandgap properties allow for light absorption across the ultraviolet and much of the visible spectrum, the coverage in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region remains limited. Here, we demonstrate a heterovalent co&#8208;doping method for synthesizing Ag and Bi doped CsSnBr3 crystals with absorption edge up to 1300&#8197;nm, making it one of the narrowest bandgap perovskite materials. The incorporation of trivalent Bi (p) orbitals is responsible for the band narrowing, while the monovalent Ag stabilizes the entire perovskite lattice. Taking advantage of the new energy states within the bandgap, the absorption edge of the co&#8208;dopants is extended to NIR region, so they can efficiently utilize sunlight. Moreover, the co&#8208;dopants exhibit significantly better antioxidation capability than the pristine CsSnBr3. When applied to CO2 photoreduction, the co&#8208;dopants achieved highly selective CO production performance, with an apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 7.56&#8201;% at 700&#8197;nm, representing a 94&#8201;% improvement over CsSnBr3. Overall, this study provides effective strategies for optimizing tin&#8208;based perovskites and holds significant implications for future research in enhancing stability, reducing toxicity, and optimizing optoelectronic performance.

         <title>Aluminum Photosensitizers on Trial: Synthesis, Crystal Structures, Photophysical and Photobiological Properties of Tris(Dipyrrinato)Aluminum(III) Complexes with Long&#8208;Lived Triplet States</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Homoleptic tris(dipyrrinato)aluminum(III) [AL(DIPY)3] complexes are easily prepared, stable, and form long&#8208;lived triplet excited states. Synthetic, structural, theoretical, photophysical, and photobiological studies highlight the potential of aluminum dipyrrin complexes as a broadly applicable class of photosensitizers.







Abstract
Metal coordination compounds are currently a focus of research in developing new photosensitizers for materials and medicinal applications. As an abundant element in the earth's crust aluminum is a suitable target element. However, only limited studies are available on its use in photoactive systems. We now report the facile preparation of a library of homoleptic tris(dipyrrinato)aluminum(III) [AL(DIPY)3] complexes. The majority of complexes was characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis and their photophysical properties upon photoexcitation and their tendency to react with the molecular oxygen of the microenvironment and generate singlet oxygen &#8208; in polar and non&#8208;polar environment was investigated. These studies are complemented by density functional theory (DFT) calculations to assess the possible electronic distribution on the frontier molecular orbitals within the complexes. As a result of charge transfer states, long&#8208;lived triplet excited states were formed and allowed for singlet oxygen generation. An initial screening of the AL(DIPY)3 complexes via in&#8197;vitro phototoxicity studies against a mouse colon carcinoma cell line (CT26) was promising as these complexes were able to trigger cell death upon irradiation at nanomolar and micromolar concentrations. The results highlight the potential of aluminum dipyrrin complexes as a broadly applicable class of photosensitizers.

Synthetic, structural, theoretical, photophysical, and photobiological studies highlight the potential of aluminum dipyrrin complexes as a broadly applicable class of photosensitizers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal coordination compounds are currently a focus of research in developing new photosensitizers for materials and medicinal applications. As an abundant element in the earth's crust aluminum is a suitable target element. However, only limited studies are available on its use in photoactive systems. We now report the facile preparation of a library of homoleptic tris(dipyrrinato)aluminum(III) [AL(DIPY)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] complexes. The majority of complexes was characterized by single crystal X-ray analysis and their photophysical properties upon photoexcitation and their tendency to react with the molecular oxygen of the microenvironment and generate singlet oxygen - in polar and non-polar environment was investigated. These studies are complemented by density functional theory (DFT) calculations to assess the possible electronic distribution on the frontier molecular orbitals within the complexes. As a result of charge transfer states, long-lived triplet excited states were formed and allowed for singlet oxygen generation. An initial screening of the AL(DIPY)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; complexes &lt;i&gt;via in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt; phototoxicity studies against a mouse colon carcinoma cell line (CT26) was promising as these complexes were able to trigger cell death upon irradiation at nanomolar and micromolar concentrations. The results highlight the potential of aluminum dipyrrin complexes as a broadly applicable class of photosensitizers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Insights into the Role of the D&#8208;Cluster in [NiFe]&#8208;CODH from Rhodospirillum Rubrum</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon monoxide dehydrogenase from Rhodospirillum rubrum is a nickel enzyme that catalyses the CO2/CO interconversion thanks to a unique [Ni4Fe4S] cofactor. In addition, the enzyme has three [4Fe4S] clusters: two B&#8208;clusters and one D&#8208;cluster. In this study, we show that the D&#8208;cluster plays a role not only as an electron relay but also in the biosynthesis of the enzyme.







Abstract
The [NiFe]&#8208;CODH from Rhodospirillum rubrum contains [4Fe4S] clusters that allow electron transfer from the buried active sites to the protein surface. Among them, the role of the D&#8208;cluster, located at the dimer interface is still not fully understood. In this study, the removal of the D&#8208;cluster by site&#8208;directed mutagenesis revealed remarkable features in the behavior of the enzyme. Quantitative analysis and spectroscopic studies unveiled the suppression of D&#8208;cluster in the mutants and the influence on other metal cofactors. Furthermore, the CO oxidation activity in solution measured in the presence of methylviologen is almost completely abolished in the mutants. Conversely, direct electrochemistry at a functionalized carbon nanotube electrode shows that the mutants are still catalytically active reaching reduced but significant current densities of 0.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the electroenzymatic activity towards oxygen is not affected by the removal of the D cluster. EPR studies reveal a remarkable change in the magnetic coupling between FeS clusters upon removal of the D&#8208;cluster, highlighting the effect of the location of this D&#8208;cluster at the dimer interface. It is noteworthy that in addition to its role as electron relay, the D&#8208;cluster appears to play an important role in the biosynthesis of the active site.

         <title>Kinetic Control and Trapping in the Supramolecular Polymerization of m&#8208;Terphenyl Bis&#8208;Urea Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The supramolecular polymerization of a m&#8208;terphenyl bis&#8208;urea macrocycle revealed unusual pathway complexity. Spectroscopic and computational analyses showed a cooperative polymerization mechanism characterized by thermal hysteresis and kinetically trapped species. Electronic structure calculations identified a conformational change in the monomer that influences assembly kinetics.







Abstract
Herein, we examine pathway complexity in the supramolecular polymerization of a novel m&#8208;terphenyl bis&#8208;urea macrocycle. Designed to induce kinetically metastable states, the macrocycle&#8216;s concentration&#8208;dependent aggregation was studied via 1H NMR and IR spectroscopy in THF and CHCl&#8323;. Temperature&#8208;dependent UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy in water/THF revealed a cooperative nucleation&#8208;growth mechanism, indicated by a shift in &#955;max to longer wavelengths upon cooling. Morphological studies using DLS, AFM, and SEM demonstrated fibrous aggregate formation. Thermal hysteresis observed in assembly&#8208;disassembly cycles indicated kinetically trapped species, with cooling governed by kinetic control and heating by thermodynamic processes. Deviations in &#916;H values during cooling, compared to van&#8242;t Hoff analysis and alignment of heating &#916;H values with thermodynamic predictions, reinforced this distinction. Spontaneous nucleation retardation, resulting from monomer trapping, led to lag times of up to 50 minutes under specific conditions. Computational studies revealed the parallel urea conformation as the more stable monomer configuration, whereas the antiparallel conformation is more stable in dimers. By probing pathway complexity of the macrocycle, we demonstrate a distinct ability to control and stabilize kinetically trapped states, broadening the scope for designing macrocyclic supramolecular polymers with tailored properties. This work deepens our understanding of supramolecular dynamics, exploring ON&#8208;pathway mechanisms and advancing tunable supramolecular materials.

         <title>Biocatalytic Stereodivergent Synthesis of Substituted Tetrahydro&#8208;Benzo&#8208;(Oxa, Thia, and Di)&#8208;Azepines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of the first IREDs assisted general biocatalytic method for the asymmetric synthesis of variously substituted N,O&#8208;, N,S&#8208; and N,N&#8208;containing heterocycles such as tetrahydro&#8208;benzo&#8208;(oxa, thia, and di)&#8208;azepines with high yield and excellent enantiomeric access is reported. In addition, a simple one&#8208;pot IRED&#8208;assisted reductive amination method is developed to access chiral tetrahydro&#8208;benzodiazepines with high stereoselectivity. The work gives facile access to a large number of chiral benzazepines containing another heteroatom and further broadens the scope of imine reductase application.







Abstract
Benzo&#8208;fused seven&#8208;membered N,O&#8208;, N,S&#8208; and N,N&#8208;containing heterocyclic moieties are found in several marketed drugs and biologically active molecules. However, the asymmetric synthesis of such heterocycles is limited to the use of transition metal catalysts or chiral phosphoric acids. In the current work, imine reductases (IREDs) are utilized to develop a general biocatalytic method for the stereodivergent synthesis of 5&#8208;substituted tetrahydro&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoxazepines, 4&#8208;substituted tetrahydro&#8208;1,5&#8208;benzothiazepines, and 2,2,4&#8208;trisubstituted tetrahydro&#8208;1,5&#8208;benzodiazepines in excellent yields (up to 96&#8201;%), enantiomeric excess (up to &gt;99&#8201;%) and diastereoselectivity (up to &gt;99&#8201;%). In addition, imine reductase assisted reductive amination gave facile access to 2,4&#8208;disubstituted tetrahydro&#8208;1,5&#8208;benzodiazepines starting from 1,3&#8208;diketone and 1,2&#8208;diamino benzene with excellent stereoselectivity and high yields. The absolute configuration of the newly synthesized N&#8208;heterocycles was determined using vibrational circular dichroism (VCD). The presented methodology has further broadened the scope of IREDs towards the preparation of chiral seven&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles containing another heteroatom.

         <title>Supramolecular Polymers for Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the recent achievements in design and synthesis of supramolecular polymers as potential biomaterials for drug delivery. In particular, various synthesis strategies, the properties and functionalities, and the delivery applications of supramolecular polymers in small molecule drug delivery, gene therapy, and protein delivery, are summarized and discussed in detail.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymers are constructed through highly reversible and directionally specific non&#8208;covalent interactions between monomer units. This unique feature enables supramolecular polymers to undergo controlled structural reconfiguration and functional transformation in response to external stimuli, imparting them with high environmental responsiveness and self&#8208;healing properties. In particular, supramolecular polymers exhibit several specific advantages compared to conventional polymers, such as inherent degradability, the ease of preparation and the incorporation of functional units, and smart responsiveness to various biological stimuli. These characters make supramolecular polymers promising candidates for intelligent drug delivery systems in complex biological environments. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the latest developments and representative achievements of supramolecular polymers in drug delivery fields, focusing primarily on the design and synthesis, the properties and functionalities, and the practical applications of supramolecular polymers in small molecule drug delivery, gene therapy, and protein delivery. Finally, we highlight future research directions, focusing on multifunctionality, adaptability, and personalized therapy. We focus on recent studies that address key challenges in the field, providing rational polymer design, important properties, functionality, and understanding delivery strategies. These developments are expected to advance supramolecular polymers as new platforms of intelligent drug delivery systems, offering innovative solutions for the treatment of complex diseases.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Metal Species as A Promoter to Enhance Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Concept systematically summarized the latest advances in single&#8208;atom promoters (SAPs) in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, elucidating their distinctive roles compared to the dominant active sites. As an important strategy for catalyst modification, SAP provide a novel approach for designing highly active and stable catalysts.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as a focal point of research in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. This paper reviews the progress in the studies of single atoms as promoters in various catalytic reactions, elucidating their distinctive role in comparison to the dominant active sites. We provide a discussion on the application of single&#8208;atom promoters (SAP) within host&#8208;guest systems in various catalysts, including metal oxide supported catalysts, molybdenum carbide&#8208;based catalysts, bimetallic catalysts, and others. The behavior of SAP is diverse. They often promote the formation of oxygen vacancies for oxide support, leading to local site reconstruction that creates specific reaction route. Moreover, they can also precisely modify the electronic structure of hetero&#8208;metal atomic or nanoparticle sites, then regulating the adsorption of reactants or intermediates and catalytic performance. Finally, the potential for the development of SAP is outlined, proposing novel approach for the design of SACs with enhanced activity and stability.

         <title>Synthesis of Porphyrin Derivatives Bearing Six Carboxylic Acids for the Formation of Three&#8208;Dimensional Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Network Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3D hydrogen&#8208;bonded networks were formed by porphyrin derivatives having six carboxylic acid groups. By varying structural configurations and solvent conditions, distinct crystalline forms with unique hydrogen&#8208;bonding patterns were achieved. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed structural diversity influenced by &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions. These findings advance supramolecular assembly strategies for tunable, high&#8208;performance materials in catalysis, sensing, and materials science.







Abstract
we synthesized a series of porphyrin derivatives with six carboxylic acid groups to explore their potential in forming hydrogen&#8208;bonded networks (YSHs). By systematically varying the position and structure of these carboxylic acid groups, we observed distinct types of hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks, including two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional networks. Using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography, we confirmed that these derivatives form YSHs with unique structural properties influenced by carboxylic acid positioning and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions. The 1Zn derivative forms a robust 3D hydrogen&#8208;bonded network stabilized by &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions, while the 2Ni derivative, with no such stacking, exhibits reduced stability and collapses upon solvent removal. Structural variations like the terphenylene and biphenyl linkers in 3Zn and 4Zn lead to flexible frameworks, while the 5Zn dimer forms two distinct structures depending on the solvent environment. Our findings reveal that careful control over carboxylic acid orientation and linker structure enables the design of diverse hydrogen&#8208;bonded networks with tunable stability and dimensionality. These insights advance our understanding of supramolecular assembly principles in porphyrin&#8208;based materials and offer new pathways for developing high&#8208;performance frameworks for applications in catalysis, sensing, and materials science.

         <title>Charge&#8208;Segregated Ion&#8208;Pairing Assemblies Comprising Dipolar &#960;&#8208;Electronic Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ion pairs comprising the dipolar &#960;&#8208;electronic cations formed charge&#8208;segregated assemblies stabilized by dipole&#8211;dipole interactions. In the B(C6F5)4&#8211; ion pairs, highly electric conductive properties depending on the packing arrangements were observed by TRMC measurements, as correlated with the theoretically estimated transfer integrals.







Abstract
Two pentamethine dyes with nearly identical structures but slightly different dipole moments were prepared as ion pairs. The ion pairs provided charge&#8208;segregated assemblies stabilized by dipole&#8211;dipole interactions between the positively charged &#960;&#8208;electronic systems. The stacking structure of the bromo&#8208;substituted pentamethine cation was more stabilized by a larger dipole moment, as suggested by energy decomposition analysis. Depending on the packing arrangements, highly electric conductive properties were observed owing to charge&#8208;segregated structures, as also correlated with the theoretically estimated transfer integrals.

         <title>Understanding the Photophysical Properties of Pd and Pt Transition&#8208;Metal Isocorroles: A Theoretical Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The main photophysical properties of recently synthesized Pd&#8211; and Pt&#8211;isocorroles, characterized and proposed as potential photosensitizers in photodynamic therapy, have been investigated and rationalized using density functional theory and its time&#8208;dependent formulation. Both the 5 and 10&#8208;(2&#8208;pyrrolyl)&#8208;5,10,15&#8208;tris(4&#8208;methylphenyl) isomers have been considered. In addition to determining the minimum energy structures of the ground and excited states, we have calculated the excitation energies, spin&#8208;orbit coupling constants, and nonradiative intersystem crossing rate constants. Results show that the photoactivity of both Pd and Pt complexes mainly depends on their singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap, which is necessary to promote the O2[[EQUATION]] excitation. The study of the photophysical properties of the free ligands indicates that this trend is common for both the free and Pt&#8211; and Pd&#8211;isocorroles.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The reactivity of group 13 anions of the form [(NON)E]&#8208;&#160;(NON = 4,5&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylanilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;xanthene, E = Al, Ga, In) towards Fe(CO)5&#160;has been investigated. In the case of the aluminyl system, both reaction outcome and product structure are highly sensitive to the availability of the potassium counterion; sequestration by 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 is necessary to yield a species featuring a direct, unsupported Al&#8211;Fe bond. 2.2.2&#8208;Cryptand, by contrast, yields a species featuring bridging carbonyl ligands, while the use of no sequestering agent at all leads to isocarbonyl bridging to aluminium. Owing to their lower oxophilicity, the heavier congeners gallium and indium more straightforwardly deliver Fe&#8211;E bonded adducts (E = Ga, In). The series of trielyl iron complexes has been interrogated by structural and computational analyses, as well as by IR and M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopies, revealing a consistent shift in bond polarity and electron richness at iron as group 13 is descended. This in turn is consistent with the diminishing donor strength of the trielyl ligand with increasing atomic number.</dc:description>

         <title>Flavanone&#8208;Enabled CuAAC Reaction: Noninnocent Reagents Driving a Mononuclear Mechanism Over the Dinuclear Paradigm</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we report the use of the CuAAC (copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition) reaction to obtain different triazole derivatives bridged to the naringenin skeleton, leading to the combination of a triazole pharmacophoric group with a bioactive flavanone. The generation of Cu(I) active species was done using CuSO4 salts and sodium ascorbate, resulting in moderate to high yields when the DMSO&#8208;water binary system was used as solvents. Mechanistic studies were done using density functional theory calculations and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). We investigated the reduction process of Cu(II) to Cu(I), and the role of mononuclear and dinuclear copper species in the catalysis of the cycloaddition reaction. Our combined theoretical and experimental results indicate that the mechanism involving a single copper species is taking place, with the cycloaddition step being the rate&#8208;determining step. The calculations indicate that the mechanism involving two copper species has the deprotonation of the coordinated terminal alkyne as the rate&#8208;determining step.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Seawater Oxygen Evolution with Improved Electronic Environment of NiCoPS through Fluorine Doping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing economical and robust electrocatalysts to prevent chlorine ions corrosion and improve seawater splitting efficiency is essential for seawater electrolysis. Herein, fluorine&#8208;doped nickel cobalt phospho&#8208;sulfide nanowires (F&#8208;NiCoPS NWs) were synthesized as high&#8208;performance catalysts for overall seawater splitting. The strongly electronegative F anion is favorable to build weak metal fluorine bonds, which easily break to generate highly active species of Ni/Co&#8208;hydroxides/oxyhydroxides protective layer on the electrode surface. This process effectively avoids chlorine evolution reaction (ClER)&#8208;induced dissolution, and enhances the stability of catalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the electronegative fluorine affects the electronic structure of the catalyst&#8217; surface, further enhancing the adsorption energy and electronic conductivity of the reaction intermediates. F&#8208;NiCoPS with appropriate F doping significantly decreased the overpotential (228 (303) mV at 10 (100) mA cm&#8208;2) and the Tafel slope (44 mV dec&#8208;1) in alkaline seawater, and exhibited a long stability of 100 h. This work provides new insights for constructing effective, cost&#8208;efficient and non&#8208;noble metal electrocatalyst for alkaline seawater splitting.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzymatic Synthesis of Saturated Bioisosteres of Ortho&#8208;Substituted Benzenes by Artificial Photoenzyme</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Saturated bioisosteres of ortho&#8208;substituted benzenes are of significant interest due to their enhanced pharmacokinetic properties, such as improved metabolic stability and reduced toxicity, making them valuable in drug design and development. However, efficient synthesis of them remains a challenge in organic chemistry. Herein, we report the biocatalytic synthesis of saturated bioisosteres of ortho&#8208;substituted benzenes using engineered artificial photoenzymes. The artificial photoenzyme, incorporating genetically encoded unnatural amino acids with benzophenone photosensitizer residue, facilitate the formation of chiral saturated bioisosteres with moderate enantiomeric excess via the energy transfer process. Our results demonstrate the versatility of artificial photoenzymes in mediating new&#8208;to&#8208;nature reactions that are difficult to achieve with conventional chemical or enzymatic methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Guest molecules containing rich&#8208;electron group incorporation into Zn&#8208;based MOF for the enhancement of iodine uptake</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radioactive iodine capture is a major concern for nuclear power generation and environmental protection. Many metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been designed and synthesized to adsorb iodine from vapor or solution, but most of them exhibited unsatisfactory iodine uptake performance because of the insufficiency of adsorption sites. Herein, we chose 1&#8208;vinyl&#8208;3&#8208;ethylimidazolium bromide (VIMB) and 1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane (DACH) with rich&#8208;electron group as guest molecules, respectively, and encapsulated them into a three&#8208;dimensional Zn&#8208;based MOF Zn&#8208;BINOL with large 1D channel (BINOL = (R)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diethoxy&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl&#8208;4,4&#8242;,6,6&#8242;&#8208;tetrabenzoate), as a result, two efficient iodine adsorbents VIMB@Zn&#8208;BINOL and DACH@Zn&#8208;BINOL were obtained. The equilibrium iodine vapor adsorption amounts of them are 1448 and 1680 mg/g at 75 &#186;C, being about 2.1 and 2.4 times more than that of Zn&#8208;BINOL, respectively. This work will provide more synthetic methods on design and preparation of iodine adsorbents with good adsorption capacity.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Aerobic Oxidation of p&#8208;Methoxybenzyl (PMB) Ethers to Aldehydes or Ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient and highly selective aerobic oxidation of p&#8208;methoxybenzyl ethers to aldehydes or ketones with Fe(NO3)3&#8226;9H2O and TEMPO as catalysts at 25 oC has been developed. This method is compatible with versatile functional groups: adamantyl, ether, alkynyl, and alkenyl, etc. Due to the mild nature of the reaction conditions, even the highly sensitive optically active aldehydes with an easily racemized &#945;&#8208;chiral center could be formed from optically active PMB ethers without racemization. Other protecting groups of hydroxyl group remained intact during the current aerobic oxidation. The catalytic protocol has been successfully applied to synthesis of (R)&#8208;tert&#8208;butyldimethylsilyl hept&#8208;1&#8208;en&#8208;6&#8208;yn&#8208;4&#8208;yl ether, which is the key intermediate for the total synthesis of natural product, (&#8208;)&#8208;6&#8208;O&#8208;methylcitreoisocoumarin.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking Catalysis Using Oxidatively Induced Reductive Elimination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidatively induced reductive elimination (OIRE) has become a crucial chemical process to enable the effective formation of otherwise much less accessible products. The chemically, electrochemically, or photochemically triggered oxidation of appropriate metal complexes leading to a reductive elimination process otherwise chemically unfavorable has long been studied in stoichiometric metal&#8208;centered reactions. However, its conscious inclusion and targeted application in catalysis is a rather recent development. Ruthenium and Group 9 metal complexes are particularly representative examples of how the observed OIRE abilities can be modulated using different coupling partners. Parallels can be drawn between rhodium and iridium, which have a long history as efficient catalysts, and their more readily available 3d row metal neighbor, i.e. cobalt, with ruthenium also providing a parallel reactivity. This review explores the history of OIRE reactions throughout the last few centuries, highlighting the role of Ti, Mo, Fe, Ru, Ni, Hg and group 9 transition metals as key players in C&#8208;H bond functionalization and OIRE chemistry, discussing the most relevant studies published in the field whilst pinpointing research gaps that require new theoretical and mechanistic studies, with the final goal of unlocking the full potential of OIRE chemistry in organometallic homogeneous catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitrile&#8208;Tolerant Iridium&#8208;Catalysed Hydrogen Isotope Exchange</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isotopically labelled molecules are vital tools within drug discovery and are used extensively to assess a given candidate&#8217;s ADMET&#160;profile. Related to this, transition metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) has become a prominent technique for the selective late&#8208;stage installation of a deuterium or tritium label. Despite having wide applicability, the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in this specific field is limited when particularly co&#8208;ordinating motifs are present within a molecule to be labelled. For example, the exceptional binding strength and sterically unencumbered nature of the nitrile functionality leads to catalyst&#160;inhibition&#160;and has hindered the development of efficient methods for the HIE of nitrile&#8208;containing molecules. Herein, in silico solvent binding energy approaches have facilitated the discovery of uniquely tolerant neutral iridium catalyst species that demonstrate a significantly lower binding strength with nitrile functionality. In turn, we describe the first effective nitrile&#8208;tolerant HIE methodology enabled via ortho&#8208;directed C(sp2)&#8722;H activation using air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable iridium pre&#8208;catalysts of the type Ir(COD)(NHC)Cl under a&#160;deuterium gas&#160;atmosphere. This methodology proceeds under mild and practicable&#160;reaction conditions with a range of directing groups, including heterocycles, ketones, and amines, with this class of catalyst also shown to be applicable towards bioactive molecules, resulting in high levels of isotopic labelling.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Based Copolymers for Templated Synthesis and Stabilization of Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface functionalization and colloidal stability are pivotal for numerous applications of gold nanoparticles (Au&#8208;NPs). Over the past decade, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have emerged as promising ligands for stabilizing Au&#8208;NPs owing to their ease of synthesis, structural diversity, and strong metal&#8208;ligand bonds. Here, we introduce new Au(I)&#8208;NHC copolymer scaffolds as precursors to multidentate NHC&#8208;protected Au&#8208;NPs. Ring&#8208;opening metathesis copolymerization of a norbornene&#8208;appended Au(I)&#8208;NHC complex with another functionalized norbornene comonomer provides a diverse array of Au(I)&#8208;NHC copolymers with modular compositions and structures. Upon reduction, these copolymers yield multidentate polyNHC&#8208;coated Au&#8208;NPs with varied properties and corona functionalities dictated by the secondary monomer. These nanoparticles exhibit excellent size homogeneity and stability against aggregation in various buffers, cell culture media, and under exposure to electrolytes, oxidants, and exogenous thiols over extended periods. Moreover, we demonstrate the post&#8208;synthetic surface functionalization reactions of polyNHC&#8208;Au&#8208;NPs while maintaining colloidal stability, highlighting their robustness and potential for applications such as bioconjugation. Overall, these findings underscore the potential of our ROMP&#8208;derived NHC&#8208;containing copolymers as highly tunable and versatile multidentate ligands that may be suitable for other inorganic colloids and flat surfaces with a wide array of applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Enantioconvergent Alkylation Reactions That Construct Chiral Quaternary Carbon Centers and Tune C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp2) Bond Rotation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In molecules with central chiral centers functionalized with aryl groups, the rotation of the single bond between the aryl group and the central chiral center may be hindered. Enantioconvergent alkylation reactions of racemic diastereomers to construct all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters resulting in easing of the rotation around the axes are described. We demonstrated that the rotation of the bond between a central chiral carbon center and a dihydrobenzofuranone can be tuned by selection of either a tertiary carbon bearing a hydrogen or a quaternary carbon at the central chiral center. The products have the benefits of a central chiral center and a flexibly rotatable bond, which can facilitate interactions with other molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of Two Distinct Stereoselective Lysine 5&#8208;Hydroxylases by Genome Mining Based on Alazopeptin Biosynthetic Enzymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzymes that catalyze regioselective and stereoselective hydroxylation of amino acids are useful tools for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals. AzpK is an unprecedented lysine 5&#8208;hydroxylase that is involved in alazopeptin biosynthesis, although its enzymatic activity has not been confirmed in vitro. Here, we identified two &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate/Fe2+&#8208;dependent dioxygenases in Actinosynnema mirum and Pseudomonas psychrotolerans (Am_AzpK2 and Pp_AzpK2, respectively) as lysine 5&#8208;hydroxylases, using genome mining based on the alazopeptin biosynthetic gene cluster. Interestingly, Am_AzpK2 and Pp_AzpK2 synthesized different isomers, (2S,5S)&#8208; and (2S,5R)&#8208;5&#8208;hydroxylysine, respectively. We also identified two AzpJ homologs as the dehydrogenases that specifically recognize the hydroxy groups of (2S,5S)&#8208; and (2S,5R)&#8208;5&#8208;hydroxylysine to synthesize a keto group. These dehydrogenases were shown to be useful tools for characterizing the stereochemistry of 5&#8208;hydroxylysine and evaluating the activity of lysine 5&#8208;hydroxylases. Furthermore, we identified three lysine 5&#8208;hydroxylases that synthesize (2S,5S)&#8208;5&#8208;hydroxylysine and four lysine 5&#8208;hydroxylases that synthesize (2S,5R)&#8208;5&#8208;hydroxylysine from the genome database. Genome scanning based on lysine 5&#8208;hydroxylases indicated the presence of undiscovered natural products with 5&#8208;hydroxylysine moieties. In conclusion, this study provides a fundamental technology for the stereoselective production of 5&#8208;hydroxylysine. Further analysis of the stereoselective lysine 5&#8208;hydroxylases would reveal how nature establishes highly stereoselective hydroxylation.</dc:description>

         <title>Quinones as Multifunctional Scaffolds for Oxidative, Reductive, and HAT Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoredox catalysis, which enables both electron and hydrogen atom transfer, has become a powerful tool for activating chemical bonds and synthesizing complex molecules under mild conditions. Typically, photocatalysts
are optimized either for oxidative or reductive reactions within a limited redox window (less than 3.1 V) and for
hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reactions, with few frameworks capable of mediating both pathways for high redox&#8208;demanding reactions (covering more than a 5 V redox window) without requiring special conditions. Herein, we report the use of quinones as multifunctional scaffolds in light&#8208;driven redox transformations, offering access to a redox window of approximately 5 V using visible light. The quinone scaffold's versatility facilitates a wide range of radical and ionic processes under both oxidative and reductive conditions, in addition to enabling HAT reactions. By keeping the parameters, i.e. the reaction partners, constant, such transformations can be carried out under just two reaction conditions. Oxidative transformations and HAT reactions occur under ambient air, while activation of the chromophore for reductive transformations can be achieved using an inorganic base (Cs2CO3) via a simple acid&#8208;base deprotonation event. This dual capability highlights the potential of quinones as scaffolds to extend their utility in photoredox catalysis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Photoactive Iridium(III) complexes are a popular synthetic tool. The impact of ligand design on their photoredox properties has been widely studied, but similar approaches to develop more potent photosensitizers are still absent. We report herein the preparation, characterization and catalytic application of a new family of Iridium(III) complexes that proved superior to their widely&#8208;used commercial peers. The best results were observed when naphthyl pendants were installed to the ligands, which could stabilize the triplet intermediates involved in energy&#8208;transfer reactions via radical&#8208;p dispersion interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Removal Of Doxycycline Hydrochloride With Cerium&#8208;aluminum Catalytic&#160;Anode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Doxycycline hydrochloride (DOX) is a widely used broad&#8208;spectrum antibiotic that is challenging to degrade, leading to a series of environmental issues. In this study, a bimetallic oxide catalyst was synthesized through hydrothermal calcination followed by annealing. The catalytic carbon cloth anode was fabricated by bonding materials directly onto carbon cloth.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Doxycycline hydrochloride (DOX) is a widely used broad-spectrum antibiotic that is challenging to degrade, leading to a series of environmental issues. In this study, a bimetallic oxide catalyst was synthesized through hydrothermal calcination followed by annealing. The catalytic carbon cloth anode was fabricated by bonding materials directly onto carbon cloth. Various characterization methods were employed to analyze the surface morphology, composition, and electrochemical properties of the electrodes. The materials exhibited rich surface morphology and exceptional electrochemical surface area. The catalyst primarily consisted of CeO2 and CeAlO3, demonstrating a 93.85% removal efficiency of DOX within 2 hours under optimized conditions. Even after seven consecutive degradation cycles, the DOX degradation rate remained at 82%, confirming the remarkable stability of the electrodes. The product distribution generated during the degradation of DOX was identified using LC-MS analysis, and a potential electrochemical degradation mechanism was proposed. Our results indicate that the bimetallic hybrid coordination significantly enhances the catalytic activity and electrochemical stability of the materials. This work offers a novel approach for preparing modified carbon cloth anodes with high catalytic activity and durability, laying a crucial foundation for the efficient degradation of the antibiotic DOX.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pt(II) Complexes Showing Multicolor Emissions from Nanoparticles in Solution and Reversible Grinding&#8208; and Heating&#8208;Induced Luminescence Switching in Solid State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emission color of complex [Pt(moppy)Cl(icna)] shows progressive redshift when the water fraction of a CH3CN&#8208;H2O mixture gradually increases from 0% to 90%. This shift is attributed to the formation of nanoparticles that facilitate inter&#8208;molecular Pt&#8208;Pt interaction and possible &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction. Moreover, this complex exhibits reversible solid&#8208;state luminescence switching upon alternately grinding and heating, mainly due to the alternating formation and destruction of inter&#8208;molecular Pt&#8208;Pt interactions.&gt;







Abstract
To well understand luminescence modulation of Pt(II) complexes by inter&#8208;molecular interactions, three platinum complexes [Pt(moppy)Cl(L)] have been synthesized (Scheme&#8197;1) through incorporating the same C^N ligand moppyH=2&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)pyridine, while different auxillary ligands L: SEt2 in 1, iccy=isocyanocyclohexane in 2, and icna=isocyanonaphthalene in 3. Crystal structures indicate that neighbouring molecules are connected through &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions, forming supramolecular dimer structures in both 1 and 2, while supramolecular chain structure in 3. In a CH3CN&#8208;H2O mixed solvent, complexes 1&#8211;3 reveal enhanced luminescence due to nanoparticle formation. Upon increasing water fraction from 0&#8201;% to 90&#8201;%, complex 1 exhibits increasing green luminescence with two broad emissions at 450 and 516&#8197;nm. In contrast, both 2 and 3 show multicolour emissions, transiting from blue to yellow&#8208;green for 2, and from blue green to orange red for 3. Moreover, complex 3 exhibits reversible luminescence switching between on state with orange&#8208;red emission and off state upon alternately grinding and heating. In this paper, we discuss the influences of molecular structures and inter&#8208;molecular &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and Pt&#8722;Pt interactions on luminescence behaviours of complexes 1&#8211;3.

         <title>Delayed fluorescence and room temperature phosphorescence from a liquid arene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Delayed emission (DF) of fluorescence is generally observed either in solution or in the crystalline state. In the latter, well&#8208;defined intermolecular interactions may play a significant role in defining the emission characteristics. Here, we present a trialkoxy&#8208;homotruxene that is liquid at room temperature and compare its emission behavior with that of a crystalline analog containing the same &#960;&#8208;electron system. The DF observed is due to triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA) and persists at low temperatures (90 K). Accompanied by slightly shorter phosphorescence and DF lifetimes, the singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap increased by 4% compared to the crystalline homolog. The replacement of methyl groups with racemic branched alkoxy chains in homotruxene derivatives proves efficient in suppressing crystallization without significantly altering DF. In neat films, the compound exhibited TTA&#8208;DF at room temperature, phosphorescence lasting up to 50 ms and Photoluminescence Quantum Yield (PLQY) of 24%. Thus, TTA&#8208;DF persists in a single&#8208;component isotropic liquid phase, showing both molecular and aggregate emissions, only slightly affected by the absence of periodic molecular stacking.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailored Nucleation&#8208;Growth Strategy for Precise Self&#8208;Assembly of Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Concept summarizes the recent advances in the precise and controllable self&#8208;assembly of block copolymers (BCPs) through a tailored nucleation&#8208;growth strategy. The self&#8208;assembly behavior of BCPs can be modulated via either small&#8208;molecule or macromolecular approach to prepare uniform homogeneous and heterogeneous nanostructures in a highly controllable manner.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly of block copolymers (BCPs) to form nanostructures of various morphologies and controllable dimensions has been a very promising research area in nanotechnology in recent decades. This concept mainly summarizes the recent advances in precise and controllable self&#8208;assembly of BCPs through a tailored nucleation&#8208;growth strategy to modulate the self&#8208;assembly behavior of the BCPs. These efforts have led to a better understanding of the self&#8208;assembly mechanisms and opened new possibilities for creating novel materials with designable properties. We hope that the concept is more than a periodical summary of previous research work and can provide valuable inspiration for the research field.

         <title>Continuous Flow Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Aminoketones as Masked Vinyl Ketone Equivalents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an efficient and scalable method for the generation of &#946;&#8208;aminoketones from amides and Grignard reagents. The continuous process operates at elevated temperatures and uses a plate&#8208;based reactor exploiting a hydrophobic internal coating to avoid reactor fouling issues due to the heterogeneous reaction mixture. The unmasking of the &#946;&#8208;aminoketone products giving valuable vinyl ketones is demonstrated.







Abstract
Herein we report the efficient synthesis of &#946;&#8208;aminoketones via addition of a vinyl Grignard reagent into amides followed by trapping of the vinyl ketone intermediate with the magnesium&#8208;amide by&#8208;product. The reaction was successfully translated from a batch process into continuous flow mode to increase its efficiency, safety and scalability. Different set&#8208;ups were evaluated to minimize/overcome clogging issues arising from magnesium salt precipitates. Ultimately, the resulting &#946;&#8208;aminoketones were obtained in high yields and productivities with residence times of less than 90&#8197;seconds at elevated temperatures of 50&#8201;&#176;C. Importantly, the &#946;&#8208;aminoketone products are valuable building blocks that can be unmasked to reactive vinyl ketones via a Cope elimination process.

         <title>Structural Revision and Total Synthesis of Primarolides A and B via Massarinin A as a Common Precursor &#8211; Discovery of a Surprising 1,4&#8208;Aryl Shift</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surprising reactivity of a natural product: A rare 1,4&#8208;aryl migration was identified as key step in the conversion of massarinin A into primarolide A. Only with the help of chemical synthesis was it possible to elucidate the correct structures of primarolides A and B, originally isolated from a marine fungus, and to prove the possibility of their non&#8208;enzymatic formation as racemates in nature.







Abstract
To probe the possible non&#8208;enzymatic formation of the polyketidic fungal metabolites primarolides A and B, the supposed 2&#8208;formyl&#8208;benzophenone precursor was prepared by chemical synthesis exploiting an anionic homo&#8208;Fries rearrangement to set up the highly substituted benzophenone unit. Conversion of this compound into the putative primarolides (i.&#8201;e. the isomeric phthalide and the corresponding N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;isoindolinone) revealed that the proposed structures had to be revised. Subsequently, the natural product massarinin A, which displays a similar 2&#8208;formyl&#8208;benzophenone substructure, was synthesized following a related strategy. Treatment of massarinin A with Sc(OTf)3 or cyanide as a nucleophilic catalyst unexpectedly proceeded under 1,4&#8208;aryl migration to afford primarolide A. In contrast, reaction of massarinin A with aniline gave rise to primarolide B without aryl shift. All structural assignments were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystal analysis and the proposed mechanism of the skeletal rearrangement was supported by 13C labeling. The study not only led to the total synthesis and structural revision of the primarolides but also supports the hypothesis of their non&#8208;enzymatic formation as racemates under the reported fermentation conditions, with the added suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) likely serving as the source of aniline.

     alt="Structural Revision and Total Synthesis of Primarolides A and B via Massarinin A as a Common Precursor &#8211; Discovery of a Surprising 1,4-Aryl Shift"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Surprising reactivity of a natural product&lt;/b&gt;: A rare 1,4-aryl migration was identified as key step in the conversion of massarinin A into primarolide A. Only with the help of chemical synthesis was it possible to elucidate the correct structures of primarolides A and B, originally isolated from a marine fungus, and to prove the possibility of their non-enzymatic formation as racemates in nature.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To probe the possible non-enzymatic formation of the polyketidic fungal metabolites primarolides A and B, the supposed 2-formyl-benzophenone precursor was prepared by chemical synthesis exploiting an anionic homo-Fries rearrangement to set up the highly substituted benzophenone unit. Conversion of this compound into the putative primarolides (i.&#8201;e. the isomeric phthalide and the corresponding &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-phenyl-isoindolinone) revealed that the proposed structures had to be revised. Subsequently, the natural product massarinin A, which displays a similar 2-formyl-benzophenone substructure, was synthesized following a related strategy. Treatment of massarinin A with Sc(OTf)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or cyanide as a nucleophilic catalyst unexpectedly proceeded under 1,4-aryl migration to afford primarolide A. In contrast, reaction of massarinin A with aniline gave rise to primarolide B without aryl shift. All structural assignments were confirmed by X-ray crystal analysis and the proposed mechanism of the skeletal rearrangement was supported by &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C labeling. The study not only led to the total synthesis and structural revision of the primarolides but also supports the hypothesis of their non-enzymatic formation as racemates under the reported fermentation conditions, with the added suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) likely serving as the source of aniline.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Diaminotriazinyl&#8208;Substituted N&#8208;Heterotriangulene: Hydrogen Bonding&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Assembly in the Solid State, in the Gas Phase and on Surfaces</title>

         <dc:description>
Dimethylmethylene&#8208;bridged N&#8208;heterotriangulene with lateral diaminotriazinyl groups was developed as a versatile building block for robust self&#8208;assembly via self&#8208;complementary hydrogen bonding under ambient conditions. Comprehensive mass spectrometry experiments, X&#8208;ray diffraction and scanning probe microscopy techniques were used to investigate the formed aggregates in the gas phase, in the crystalline bulk and on surfaces.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and comprehensive characterization of a dimethylmethylene&#8208;bridged N&#8208;heterotriangulene (N&#8208;HTA) with diaminotriazinyl groups to guide the self&#8208;assembly through directional hydrogen bonding. Mass spectrometry collision&#8208;induced dissociation experiments indicated the formation of multiply charged clusters in the gas phase. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies revealed that the solid state packing is governed by an interplay between the hydrogen bonding and the solvent system used for crystallization. The self&#8208;assembly on both semiconducting and insulating surfaces upon simple drop&#8208;casting was disclosed by atomic force microscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy. The strong hydrogen bonding leads to robust self&#8208;assembly on surfaces, which can be conveniently achieved by simple solution processing techniques under ambient conditions.

         <title>Regulating the Cytotoxicity of Anticancer Drugs by Pillar[6]arene&#8208;based Host&#8208;Guest Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pillar[6]arene forms a stable host&#8208;guest complex with chlorambucil, exhibiting a dual pH/ATP response. This complex can not only effectively release chlorambucil to reduce cytotoxicity to normal cells but also consume ATP, thereby synergistically enhancing the antitumor performance against cancer cells. Designing ATP&#8208;stimulated host&#8208;guest complexes based on pillar[6]arene represents a promising strategy for tumor therapy.







Abstract
Creating molecular&#8208;level host&#8208;guest complexes with properties responsive to endogenous substance stimuli&#8208;responsive as drug delivery systems, is critical for improving drug stability, reducing side effects, and amplifying therapeutic efficacy. Herein, a delivery system for the chemotherapeutic drug chlorambucil (CLB) was developed using the host&#8208;guest interaction with amino&#8208;pillar[6]arene (NP6). NP6 exhibits a high affinity for CLB (Ka=3.5&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1), resulting in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 host&#8208;guest complex NP6@CLB. This complex not only effectively prevents premature drug leakage and improves drug stability but also significantly reduces the cytotoxicity of CLB on L&#8208;02 cells. Notably, NP6 also demonstrated superior complexation (Ka=3.6&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1) with ATP, an endogenous substance in cells. During NP6@CLB delivery, ATP can compete with CLB to form a host&#8208;guest complex with NP6. This process blocks drug efflux while releasing CLB, thereby synergistically enhancing the antitumor effects on HeLa cells. This &#8220;one stone, two birds&#8221; design strategy&#8212;where host&#8208;guest complexes facilitate both direct drug delivery and synergistic enhancement of antitumor properties via ATP binding, opens a new perspective for constructing multifunctional supramolecular chemotherapeutic platforms based on pillar[n]arene.

         <title>Structural, Physicochemical, and Biological Insights into Novel (Acetylacetonate)(Oxydiacetato)Oxidovanadium(IV) Complexes with N&#8208;Containing Aromatic Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis, structure and physicochemical properties of three novel oxidovanadium salts composed of [VO(acac)(oda)]&#8722; anion (acac=acetylacetonate; oda=oxydiacetate) and quinolinium, isoquinolinium or acridinium cation is presented. The characterization is supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Additionally, their cytotoxic effects were assessed against breast cancer cell lines to explore their therapeutic potential in cancer treatment.







Abstract
The crystal structures of three novel oxidovanadium(IV) salts containing the [VO(acac)(oda)]&#8722; anion (acac=acetylacetonate, oda=oxydiacetate) and quinolinium ([QH]+), isoquinolinium ([(isoQ)H+) and acridinium ([(acr)H+)] counterions, of molecular formulas [QH][VO(acac)(oda)] (1), [(isoQ)H][VO(acac)(oda)](H2O) (2) and [(acr)H][VO(acac)(oda)](H2O)2 (3) are reported. Notably, these complexes represent the first structurally characterized salts comprising the heteroligand [VO(acac)(oda)]&#8722; complex anion. A comprehensive physicochemical characterization of the complexes in both solid state and solution is provided, with general discussions on the role of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds on the structure of the resulting ternary oxidovanadium(IV) complexes. The experimental results were complemented by density functional theory (DFT) calculations to evaluate possible ligand conformations in the coordination sphere of V(IV). In addition, the nature of the bonds involved in the chelation of the vanadium(IV) cation is considered and a detailed assessment of the electron spin density is presented. Finally, the cytotoxic activity of the compounds was tested against breast (MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 and MCF&#8208;7) cancer cell lines to assess their potential use as chemotherapeutic agents in cancer therapy.

         <title>Pt Nanoparticles Loaded on Bimetallic Porphyrinic MOF for Selective Hydrogenation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pt NPs incorporated MOF (Pt/PCN&#8208;224 (FeCo)) with Fe/Co single atoms has been successfully fabricated. Pt/PCN&#8208;224 (FeCo) exhibited high catalytic activity in the chemoselective hydrogenation of biomass&#8208;derived furfural (FFA) to cyclopentanone (CPO). Fe/Co sites of the ligands could effectively tune the electronic properties of Pt NPs, and Co sites could synergistically promote the hydrogen spillover, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity.







Abstract
Metal nanoparticles (MNPs) loaded on metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) show promising catalytic performances in various reactions, but finely tuning the electronic properties of MNPs remains challenging. Herein, metal NP&#8208;MOF synergy has been finely regulated by incorporating Pt NPs into PCN&#8208;224 (FeCo). The as&#8208;prepared Pt/PCN&#8208;224 (FeCo) exhibited high catalytic activity in the hydrogenation of various carbonyl substrates. Detailed characterizations and mechanistic studies revealed that the Fe/Co sites of the ligands can effectively tune the electronic properties of Pt NPs, which achieved promoted capability to activate H2. The atomic hydrogen (H*) produced by Pt sites mainly migrated to the Co sites to promote the hydrogenation process via hydrogen spillover, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity. This work is devoted to a promising strategy to optimize the catalytic performance of MOF&#8208;based nanomaterials by incorporating metal NPs in the thermocatalytic systems.

         <title>Chiral N&#8208;Alkylfluorenyl&#8208;Substituted N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes in the Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Cycloisomerization of 1,6&#8208;Enynes</title>

         <dc:description>
Four chiral [AuCl(A*Flu&#8208;NHC)] complexes (A*Flu&#8208;NHC for 9&#8208;alkyl&#8208;9&#8208;fluorenyl N&#8208;substituted N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) have been prepared in only four steps using commercially available enantiopure styrene oxide as chiral source. Their use as pre&#8208;catalysts in the enantioselective cycloisomerization of 1,6&#8208;enynes gave up to 72&#8201;% ee. A remarkable hydrogen bond interaction probably rigidifies the catalyst structure and optimizes the chirality transfer.







Abstract
A series of chiral A*Flu&#8208;NHC&#8208;gold(I) complexes, where A*Flu&#8208;NHC is an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene or benzimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) bearing a chiral 9&#8208;alkyl&#8208;9&#8208;fluorenyl N&#8208;substituent and a 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl or benzyl N&#8217;&#8208;substituent, were straightforwardly prepared in few steps from readily available 2,6&#8208;diisopropylamine, imidazole or benzimidazole. The chirality of the N&#8208;substituent lies in the presence of a chiral alcoholic alkyl chain on the fluorenyl, which results from the opening of commercially available chiral styrene oxide, yielding to a 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;phenylethyl or a 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethyl group. Four [AuCl(A*Flu&#8208;NHC)] complexes were tested as precatalysts in an enantioselective cycloisomerization of a 1,6&#8208;enyne. Notably, the best inductions were observed with the benzimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene derivative bearing a 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethyl group on the fluorenyl ring, showing that a constrained rotation around the N&#8722;Cfluorenyl bond and a chiral center in &#945; position of the fluorenyl ring are determining factors. Interestingly, a strong improvement of the induction with up to 72&#8201;% ee was observed using AgOTf as activator. The presence of a hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group and OTf&#8722; in the in&#8197;situ generated active cationic gold(I) species probably stiffens its structure. This type of ligand&#8208;counteranion interaction represents a novel strategy for optimizing chirality transfer in asymmetric gold(I) catalysis.

         <title>Recent Advances on Organic Scintillators with High Exciton Utilization Efficiency for X&#8208;Ray Scintillation and Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New classes of organic scintillators have recently attracted significant attention for X&#8208;ray scintillation and imaging. This concept article explores new&#8208;generation organic scintillators, focusing on molecular design strategies, emission mechanisms, scintillation performance and their applications in X&#8208;ray imaging.







Abstract
Organic scintillators have rapidly emerged in recent years for X&#8208;ray scintillation and imaging, benefiting from their inherent advantages of abundant raw materials, low&#8208;temperature processing, high mechanical flexibility, and easy of large&#8208;scale fabrication. However, conventional organic scintillators suffer from weak X&#8208;ray absorption and inefficient exciton utilization, limiting their commercial viability. To overcome these challenges, new&#8208;generation organic scintillators have recently been developed with innovative emission mechanisms to ensure exciton utilization efficiency and the incorporation of heavy atoms to improve X&#8208;ray absorption. In recent years, these advancements have led to remarkable progress in high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray scintillation and imaging. Here, we present a concept article on new&#8208;generation organic scintillators with high exciton utilization efficiency, focusing on molecular design, emission mechanisms, scintillation performance, and X&#8208;ray imaging applications. We also discuss future development trends in organic X&#8208;ray scintillators.

         <title>Benzo&#8208;Fused Phosphepines: Synthesis by Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Hydroarylation and Ring Inversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular hydroarylation reaction of dialkynyl(biaryl)phosphine oxides afforded two diastereomers of phosphepines, O&#8208;exo adducts (major) and O&#8208;endo adducts (minor). The interconversion between these isomers via a ring inversion of phosphepine with a planar structure was also investigated experimentally and theoretically.







Abstract
Gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular hydroarylation of dialkynyl(biaryl)phosphine oxides provided versatile benzo&#8208;fused phosphepine oxides. O&#8208;exo adducts were obtained as the major product, and O&#8208;endo adducts were the minor product. O&#8208;exo and O&#8208;endo indicate the position of an oxygen atom with respect to the central phosphepine framework. The isomers of dibenzo[b,d]phosphepine oxides with methyl and phenyl groups in an adjacent position (shown as 2&#8201;a and 3&#8201;a in the main text) were determined by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. O&#8208;exo and O&#8208;endo adducts are diastereomers owing to the central chirality of the phosphorus atom and the planar chirality of phosphepine, and they are interconverted through a ring inversion of phosphepine via a transition state with a planar structure. The inversion barrier, fully estimated through theoretical calculations, drastically varied depending on the substituents in the phosphepine framework and/or the fusion of benzene and thiophene rings. Furthermore, the kinetics of the thermal isomerization of less stable O&#8208;endo product 3&#8201;a into O&#8208;exo product 2&#8201;a was examined.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Photoredox Catalytic Direct N&#8208;(Het)Arylation of Lactams</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lactam rings can be introduced to a diverse range of arenes and heteroarenes employing our mild and efficient photoredox method. The N&#8208;(het)arylation of lactams also works in aqueous media, allowing the functionalization of biomolecules. Moreover, the photochemical reaction can be easily scaled under continuous flow conditions, making it suitable for large&#8208;scale applications.







Abstract
Lactam rings are essential structural motifs in organic chemistry, widely present in natural products and clinically important drugs, such as antibiotics and antiepileptics. Existing methods for synthesizing N&#8208;functionalized lactams often require harsh conditions, toxic reagents, or complex catalytic systems. Here, we report a mild and efficient photochemical approach for generating N&#8208;centered radicals, enabling straightforward N&#8208;heteroarylation of lactams. This versatile method enables the synthesis of a range of N&#8208;(het)arylated lactams and is effective even in aqueous media, facilitating the functionalization of biomolecules. Furthermore, the photochemical reaction is easily scalable under continuous flow conditions, making it highly suitable for large&#8208;scale applications.

         <title>The Next Generation of Phosphorus Bisylide Superbases &#8211; Synthesis, Structures, Basicity and Proton Self&#8208;Exchange</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
On the search for the most basic proton sponge ever described the effects of stronger donating pyrrolidino vs. dimethylamino P&#8208;substituents as well as the homologisation of previously described bis phosphorus ylide base MHPN is investigated by synthesis, spectroscopy, crystallography, pKaH measurements and DFT calculations.







Abstract
Herein we present two phosphorus ylide superbases to enhance the basicity of 1,8&#8208;bis (methylylidene (hexamethyltriamino) phosphorane) naphthalene (MHPN) &#8211; the first superbase with interacting carbon atoms as basicity centers. Its 1&#8208;pyrrolidinyl substituted analog 1,8&#8208;bis (methylylidene (tris (1&#8208;pyrrolidinyl)) phosphorane) naphthalene (MTPN) and MHPN's theoretically predicted higher homologue P2&#8208;MHPN exhibit extreme pKaH values of 26.0 and 29.5 (experimental) in THF solution and 33.6 and 37.4 (estimated) in acetonitrile solution.

&lt;p&gt;On the search for the most basic proton sponge ever described the effects of stronger donating pyrrolidino vs. dimethylamino P-substituents as well as the homologisation of previously described bis phosphorus ylide base MHPN is investigated by synthesis, spectroscopy, crystallography, pK&lt;sub&gt;aH&lt;/sub&gt; measurements and DFT calculations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein we present two phosphorus ylide superbases to enhance the basicity of 1,8-bis (methylylidene (hexamethyltriamino) phosphorane) naphthalene (MHPN) &#8211; the first superbase with interacting carbon atoms as basicity centers. Its 1-pyrrolidinyl substituted analog 1,8-bis (methylylidene (tris (1-pyrrolidinyl)) phosphorane) naphthalene (MTPN) and MHPN's theoretically predicted higher homologue P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-MHPN exhibit extreme p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;aH&lt;/sub&gt; values of 26.0 and 29.5 (experimental) in THF solution and 33.6 and 37.4 (estimated) in acetonitrile solution. The corresponding calculated gas phase basicity values are 281.4 and 284.6&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. We prepared the neutral free bases together with the corresponding mono- and bisprotonated species which were characterized by NMR spectroscopy, ESI mass spectrometry, IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis and partly XRD analysis. The monoprotonated forms exhibit a rapid proton self-exchange between the two carbon atoms in peri-position and dynamic NMR spectroscopic methods revealed self-exchange rates of 2298&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 300&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 300&#8197;K for MTPN and P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-MHPN, respectively.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Backboned Polymers: A New Concept for Thermoelectric Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thermoelectric materials, capable of directly converting heat into electricity, offer significant potential for advancing renewable energy solutions. However, conventional thermoelectric materials, typically based on bulky structures, are constrained by the thermoelectric transport paradox. Metal&#8208;backboned polymers, emerging as one&#8208;dimensional materials designed at the single atom level, offer quantum confinement that enhances electrical conductivity while reducing thermal conductivity, potentially overcoming the above limitations. Herein, we explore the potential of metal&#8208;backboned polymers for the development of highly efficient thermoelectric materials, including their synthesis, structural advantages, potential applications and recent advancements. Moreover, current challenges and promising directions for further advancing their performance and applicability in eco&#8208;friendly energy technologies are also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Reaction of a Potassium Aluminyl with Sn[N(SiMe3)2]2 &#8208; Isolation of a Stable, Trimetallic Sn(I) Radical Anion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of the potassium aluminyl K[Al(NON)] ([NON]2&#8211; = [O(SiMe2NDipp)2]2&#8211;, Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) with the stannylene Sn[N(SiMe3)2]2 in benzene afforded K3[(Sn4){Al(NON)}2{N(SiMe3)2}], containing a distorted tetrahedral Sn4&#8208;cluster. Computational analysis indicates that four of the edges in this unit are composed of Sn&#8211;Sn bonds, with the remaining two that are spanned by aluminium involved in three centre two electron (3c2e) Sn&#8211;Al&#8211;Sn bonds. The formation of Al(II) species during this reaction is indicated by the isolation of the dialuminated cyclohexadiene 1,4&#8208;[Al(NON)]2(&#956;&#8208;C6H6). Repeating the reaction in methylcyclohexane generated a thermally stable, trimetallic Sn(I) radical anion in K[Sn{Al(NON)}2]. Compared to all other reported Sn(I) radicals, its EPR spectrum is unique; the main turning points of its spectrum appear at g values above 2 and the Sn hyperfine coupling is substantially smaller in magnitude. These data, together with ENDOR measurements and DFT calculations show that the SOMO is entirely localised in an unhybridised 5p orbital, such that spin&#8208;orbit contributions to the g and Sn hyperfine tensors are quenched.</dc:description>

         <title>Monitoring On&#8208;Surface Chemical Reactions by Low&#8208;Energy Electron Microscopy: from Conformation Change to Ring Closure in 2D Molecular Gas</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>On&#8208;surface synthesis is a promising strategy for the preparation of molecules that are not achievable otherwise. Understanding the mechanism of on&#8208;surface reactions requires knowledge of the molecular structure and possible organization of reactants into supramolecular assemblies during the reaction. Scanning probe techniques are essential for the unambiguous identification of the products and for determining their electronic and magnetic properties. However, these are generally not capable of imaging the surface at reaction conditions and, therefore, answering some of the key questions about the reaction mechanism. Here, we show that real&#8208;time low&#8208;energy electron microscopy &#160;can monitor the surface processes in real time and provide the necessary complementary mechanistic insights into on&#8208;surface reactions. We monitor the intramolecular ring&#8208;closure reaction of 1,3,5&#8208;tris(7&#8208;methyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;carbolin&#8208;6&#8208;yl)benzene on the Au(111) surface and show that it takes place in the 2D molecular gas phase at elevated temperatures. Products condense into separate islands upon cooling, enabling fast and efficient assessment of product yields. This makes LEEM an efficient tool for studying intramolecular chemical reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Bio&#8208;Based Surfactants via Borrowing Hydrogen Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A borrowing hydrogen approach to produce bio&#8208;based surfactants is described. Using amino acids and common alcohols without protecting groups, surfactants are synthesized in one step with a ruthenium catalyst, achieving nearly ideal atom economy, including Gemini surfactants and a quaternary ammonia salt, with remarkable surfactant properties and potential biodegradability, enhancing the broad application profile of these sustainable products.







Abstract
A borrowing hydrogen approach to produce bio&#8208;based surfactants is described. The process utilizes ubiquitous amino acids and common alcohols without protecting group manipulations. Surfactants are synthesized in a single step using a commercially available ruthenium&#8208;based catalyst in a waste&#8208;free manner with nearly ideal atom economy. The versatility of the products is shown by further derivatization resulting in novel Gemini surfactants and a related quaternary ammonia salt. The analysis of selected compounds shows remarkable properties as surfactants. Further studies show their potential biodegradability in nature, which enhances the broad application profile of the sustainable products prepared in this study.

         <title>The Lassa Virus Stable Signal Peptide Undergoes a Conformational Change to Aid Viral Fusion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A critical event in the lifecycle of the Lassa virus (LASV) is membrane fusion, where the viral membrane merges with the host cell membrane. This process is initiated by the LASV surface glycoprotein complex (GPC) upon exposure to the acidic environment of the endocytic pathway. A unique aspect of the GPC is the stable signal peptide (SSP), located adjacent to the transmembrane region of glycoprotein 2 (GP2), the primary fusion subunit. While previous research has established the importance of SSP in fusion, its precise role has not been fully understood due to limited biophysical data. Our study aims to elucidate SSP's role by examining its structural changes under different pH conditions. At neutral pH (pH 7), SSP is primarily &#945;&#8208;helical corresponding to its prefusion state. However, when exposed to acidic conditions (pH &lt; 5), mimicking the late endosome, SSP undergoes a conformational change, increasing its helical content. Furthermore, we show that this structural change enhances fusion efficiency, indicating a direct involvement of SSP in facilitating membrane fusion. In conclusion, our findings suggest that SSP undergoes a critical conformational change at low pH, essential for its role in the LASV fusion mechanism, thereby deepening our understanding of LASV fusion.</dc:description>

         <title>Fragment&#8208;Based Approach for Hierarchical Nanotube Assembly of Small Molecules in Aqueous Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A fragment&#8208;based approach has proven successful in drug design and protein assemblies, yet its potential for constructing biomaterials from simple organic building blocks remains underexplored, particularly for self&#8208;assembly in aqueous phases, where water disrupts intermolecular hydrogen bonding. This study introduces the first case of integrating fragments from self&#8208;assembling molecules to design a small organic molecule that forms novel hierarchical nanotubes with polymorphism. The molecule's compact design incorporates three structural motifs derived from known nanotube assemblies, enabling a hierarchical assembly process: individual molecules with two conformations form dimers, which organize into hexameric units. These hexamers further assemble into nanotubes comprising 2&#8208;, 5&#8208;, and 6&#8208;protofilament fibers. The nanofibers share a nearly identical asymmetric unit&#8212;a hexameric triangular plate&#8212;with similar axial and lateral interfaces. The lateral interface, involving interactions between phosphate groups and aromatic rings, exhibits plasticity, allowing slight rotational variations between adjacent units. This adaptability facilitates the formation of diverse nanofiber architectures, showcasing the flexibility of these systems in aqueous environments. By leveraging fragments of self&#8208;assembling molecules, this work demonstrates a straightforward strategy that combines conformational flexibility and self&#8208;assembling fragments to construct advanced supramolecular biomaterials from small organic building blocks in aqueous settings.</dc:description>

         <title>Computational Study of Alkyne&#8208;Acid Cycloisomerization in Gold&#8208;Functionalized Resorcinarene Cavitand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report density functional theory calculations to investigate the reaction mechanism and the selectivity of the cycloisomerization of alkynoic acids inside a gold&#8208;functionalized resorcinarene&#8208;based cavitand. This cavitand has experimentally been shown to catalyze the cycloisomerization of a number of substituted alkynoic acids to give the corresponding &#947;&#8208;lactones. Three representative substrates, with different substitution patterns, are considered in the calculations, and for each of them, the geometries and energies of various binding modes are first characterized. Next, the cycloisomerization reaction mechanism is evaluated, which is shown to consist of an intramolecular addition of the carboxylic acid to the gold&#8208;activated alkyne triple bond, followed by a protodeauration step. Both 5&#8208;exo&#173;&#8208;dig and 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclizations were considered, leading to &#947;&#8208; or &#7839;&#8208;lactones, respectively, and the involvement of the triflate counterion in the cyclization step is discussed. Finally, the influence of the cavitand walls on the reactivity is evaluated by using a model catalyst in which the walls were removed.</dc:description>

         <title>Ba2BP7N14 &#8212; A Quaternary Alkaline Earth Nitridoborophosphate with a Mixed 3D Network Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly condensed alkaline earth nitridophosphates have attracted increasing scientific interest, due to their high thermal and chemical stability, as well as their promising luminescence behavior upon doping with Eu2+ for pc&#8208;LED applications. In particular, the barely explored mixed tetrahedra&#8208;based nitridophosphates offer a wide range of structural and compositional diversity, enabling new insights into structure&#8208;property relationships. Herein, we report on the first quaternary alkaline earth nitridoborophosphate Ba2BP7N14, synthesized at 8 GPa and 1600 &#176;C in a multianvil press, starting from Ba(N3)2, h&#8208;BN and P3N5. Ba2BP7N14 crystallizes in the barylite&#8208;1O polytype and features a highly condensed mixed (B,P)&#8211;N anionic 3D network (&#954; &#8776; 0.57) built up of PN4 and mixed occupied (P0.75B0.25)N4 tetrahedra. The structure was characterized by a multi&#8208;step process involving single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD, PXRD), elemental analysis, electron microscopy (STEM, EELS), and solid&#8208;state 31P and 11B MAS NMR spectroscopy. The plausibility of the structural model was corroborated by low&#8208;cost crystallographic calculations. The optical band gap and the thermal behavior of an undoped sample of Ba2BP7N14, were determined from diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and temperature&#8208;dependent powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, respectively. Irradiation of a Eu2+&#8208;doped sample with near&#8208;UV light results in a blue emission peaking at &#955;em = 422 nm.</dc:description>

         <title>Green Synthesis of Copper Nanoparticles utilising the Maillard Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper presents a green synthesis method for copper nanoparticles using the Amadori rearrangement followed by the Maillard reaction. Naturally derived reagents like monosaccharides (xylose and galactose) and arginine reduce copper ions in an aqueous solution. The nanoparticle size, adjustable by arginine concentration, ranges from in the lowest regime between 3&#8211;16&#8197;nm.







Abstract
A new approach for the fabrication copper nanoparticles by a wet chemical reduction method is reported. The natural resources arginine as amino compound and several monosaccharides (xylose, ribose, galactose and glucose) react characteristically performing an Amadori rearrangement followed by a Maillard type reaction. This reaction carried out in an aqueous solution ensures an environmentally friendly way of reducing copper(II) ions leading to the formation of the desired nanoparticles. By changing the concentration of the amino acid, simultaneously acting as a complexing agent, it is possible to tune the size of the resulting nano particles to a certain degree down to 3&#8197;nm. This nontoxic and facile preparation route with quantitative yield opens a wide field of applications ranging from electronics to medical approaches.

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing Behavior of Metallopolymers in Complex3D&#8208;Structures Obtained by DLP&#8208;Based 3D&#8208;Printing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the digital light processing (DLP) based three&#8208;dimensional (3D) printing of metallopolymers featuring self&#8208;healing abilities. The obtained structures were able to heal mechanical damage with excellent efficiencies up to 97&#8201;% without losing their 3D&#8208;structure. Additionally, the healing behavior in dependency of the molecular structure was analyzed in detail revealing new structure&#8208;property&#8208;relationships.







Abstract
This current study focusses on the investigation of the self&#8208;healing abilities of metallopolymers containing different kinds of metal complexes, which were processed by direct digital light processing (DLP) based three&#8208;dimensional (3D) printing. For this purpose, 2&#8208;phenoxyethyl acrylate is mixed with ligand&#8208;containing monomers either based on triphenylmethyl(trt)&#8208;histidine or terpyridine, respectively. Either zinc(II) or nickel(II) salts are successfully applied for a complexation of the ligand monomers in solution and, subsequently, photopolymerization is performed. The thermo&#8208;mechanical properties of the obtained metallopolymers were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) as well as dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA). Multiple damages with defined forces ranging from 20 to 1500&#8197;mN were introduced into the 3D&#8208;structures and successfully healed within 24&#8197;h at 70&#8201;&#176;C or 120&#8201;&#176;C, respectively without losing the structural integrity of the overall 3D&#8208;structures. Herein, excellent healing efficiencies up to 97&#8201;% were determined. Consequently, these hollow structures not only feature very good self&#8208;healing abilities but also excellent retention of the 3D&#8208;structure at and above the healing temperature.

         <title>Helicene&#8211;Fluorescein Hybrids: A Reversible Base&#8208;Triggered (Chir)optical Switch with Sign Inversion of Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel hybrid molecules combining helicene and fluorescein act as pH&#8208;responsive circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials. They exhibit dual&#8208;mode switching, shifting from blue to red emission with CPL sign inversion upon base addition. This rare behavior in small molecules enables simultaneous control of emission wavelength and CPL handedness, offering potential for stimuli&#8208;responsive chiral materials and biological applications.







Abstract
Novel circularly&#8208;polarized&#8208;luminescence (CPL) materials were designed and synthesized by integrating the intrinsic chirality of helicene with the acid/base&#8208;responsive properties of fluorescein. The synthesized helicene&#8211;fluorescein hybrids exhibit reversible switching between blue fluorescence under neutral conditions and red fluorescence under basic conditions. Furthermore, these hybrid compounds demonstrate unique chiroptical switching behavior with a rare base&#8208;triggered CPL sign inversion, where (P)&#8208;isomers show a negative CPL signal around 450&#8197;nm under neutral conditions and a positive signal around 620&#8197;nm under basic conditions, with three&#8208;fold enhanced dissymmetry factors (|glum|) under basic conditions. The structural basis for this switching was elucidated through TD&#8208;DFT calculations, revealing distinct angles between magnetic and electric transition dipole moments in closed versus open forms. Live&#8208;cell imaging experiments using HeLa cells revealed that the hybrid compounds exhibit intracellular red emission with minimal cytotoxicity, thus promising potential as chiral fluorescent probes for biological applications.

This rare behavior in small molecules enables simultaneous control of emission wavelength and CPL handedness, offering potential for stimuli-responsive chiral materials and biological applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novel circularly-polarized-luminescence (CPL) materials were designed and synthesized by integrating the intrinsic chirality of helicene with the acid/base-responsive properties of fluorescein. The synthesized helicene&#8211;fluorescein hybrids exhibit reversible switching between blue fluorescence under neutral conditions and red fluorescence under basic conditions. Furthermore, these hybrid compounds demonstrate unique chiroptical switching behavior with a rare base-triggered CPL sign inversion, where (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;)-isomers show a negative CPL signal around 450&#8197;nm under neutral conditions and a positive signal around 620&#8197;nm under basic conditions, with three-fold enhanced dissymmetry factors (|&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;|) under basic conditions. The structural basis for this switching was elucidated through TD-DFT calculations, revealing distinct angles between magnetic and electric transition dipole moments in closed versus open forms. Live-cell imaging experiments using HeLa cells revealed that the hybrid compounds exhibit intracellular red emission with minimal cytotoxicity, thus promising potential as chiral fluorescent probes for biological applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stabilization of a Terminal Hydride Through Regioselective Protonation in a Diiron Complex Inspired by [FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acid strength and steric hindrance orients regioselective protonation of an electron&#8208;rich dithiolate diiron complex, related to the H&#8208;cluster. Weaker acids promote the main formation of an exceptionally stable terminal hydride complex, whereas stronger acids mostly favor a bridging hydride isomer.







Abstract
Protonation studies of the complex [Fe2(&#956;&#8208;pdt)(&#954;2&#8208;dmpe)2(CO)2] (1), inspired by the [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenases active site cofactor, yield terminal and bridging hydrido isomers in a ratio that depends on the acid strength and steric hindrance. A terminal hydride ligand is mainly obtained in presence of weaker acids such as [HPtBu3][BF4] and [HNEt3][BF4] while a bridging isomer is predominantly formed with stronger acids such as [HPPh3][BF4] and [H(OEt2)][BF4]. The terminal isomer is comparatively stable and undergoes isomerization into the bridging hydride following first&#8208;order kinetics, with half&#8208;lives of 21&#8197;days and 3&#8197;days at room temperature and 40&#8201;&#176;C, respectively.

Blue&#8208;emissive donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor material PCZ&#8208;P&#8208;PY is synthesized. Weak charge&#8208;transfer (CT) character brought by the pyrene bridge gives rise to the high PLQY as well as the construction of efficient &#8220;hot&#8208;exciton&#8221; channel. As a result, an impressive electroluminescent efficiency of 5.9% is achieved, highlighting the potential of this material in advanced optoelectronic applications.







Abstract
Blue emitters are crucial in the organic light emitting diode (OLED) industry and scientific field. In this work, we prepared a novel donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A) molecular PCZ&#8722;P&#8208;PY using pyrene as a bridge to construct hybrid local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) state with weak charge&#8208;transfer (CT) property. This excited state design give rise to the high photoluminescent quantum yield (PLQY), more importantly, it is also responsible for the high exciton utilization efficiency (EUE) by constructing efficient hot&#8208;exciton channel. As a result, exceeding external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 5.7&#8201;% is achieved in the non&#8208;doped OLED of PCZ&#8722;P&#8208;PY with exceeding EUE of up to 90&#8201;%.

The synthesis of an organometallic&#8208;polypeptide block copolymer with a crystallizable polyferrocenyldimethylsilane block and a hydrophilic poly(L&#8208;glutamic acid) block is systematically explored. Rod&#8208;like and plate&#8208;like micelles with polypeptide coronas form in aqueous solutions via crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly.

Abstract
The synthesis of polyferrocenyldimethylsilane&#8208;b&#8208;poly(L&#8208;glutamic acid) block copolymers was systematically explored. Rod&#8208;like and plate&#8208;like micelles were prepared from self&#8208;assembly of the block copolymers in aqueous solution with two different approaches. In a dissolution&#8208;dialysis approach, micelles were prepared by dissolving a block copolymer sample in excess aqueous base followed by the dialysis of the solution against water. The morphology of the resultant micelles showed composition dependence. The block copolymer sample with the lowest soluble block content formed rod&#8208;like micelles, while the other samples with higher soluble block content formed spherical micelles. In a THF&#8208;mediated approach, THF was added into a block copolymer solution, which was first prepared by the dissolution&#8208;dialysis approach, and then the THF was evaporated slowly. Plate&#8208;like micelles were obtained from all the block copolymer samples examined, and these had a broad range of soluble block content. The formation of these plate&#8208;like micelles was attributed to the crystallization of the PFDMS blocks in the presence of THF. A tendency of large platelet micelles evolving to thin filaments over time was observed. This change may have been driven by the increase in the corona&#8208;chain stretching energy as THF evaporated.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combination of cages and polymer science shows promise in developing innovative materials with diverse properties and applications, especially soft material with dual porosity. Cage&#8208;gel hybrid materials can be constructed through covalent bonding, non&#8208;covalent interactions, and orthogonal systems and have been designed with diverse functions, including stimuli responsiveness, self&#8208;healing, guest encapsulation and release, and so forth.







Abstract
The combination of supramolecular self&#8208;assemblies and polymer science has resulted in the development of soft materials with diverse properties and applications. In particular, the coordination cages of predefined shape, size, and internal cavity can be utilized intelligently as promising building units for designing responsive and smart soft materials with dual porosity, contributing to the introduction of versatile host&#8208;guest chemistry into gels. In this review, we present the recent advancements in gels incorporating coordination cages into their networks, ranging from synthesis strategies to state&#8208;of&#8208;art applications. In particular, the host&#8208;guest chemistry endows the hybrid gel materials with possibilities for guest&#8208;specific responsive systems.

The weak substrate adsorption by binuclear copper prevents catalyst poisoning, ensuring sustained activity throughout the process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Hydrolysis by Engineered Cutinases: Characterization of Aliphatic&#8208;Aromatic Homo and Co&#8208;Polyesters by LC and LC&#8208;MS methods</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The performance, biodegradability, and recyclability of polymers can be tuned during synthesis by adopting monomers with different chemical characteristics. Recent research has shown the aptness of some hydrolases to depolymerize polyesters under mild conditions compared to chemical approaches. Herein, we engineered a cutinase from Thermobifida cellulosilytica (Tc_Cut2NVWCCG) for improved thermostability (up to 91 &#176;C) and compared it with previously reported leaf&#8208;branch compost cutinase (LCCWCCG) for the hydrolysis of low molar mass substrates, as well as aliphatic and aromatic homo&#8208; and co&#8208;polyesters. For both enzymes, higher hydrolysis rates were observed for aliphatic compared to aromatic homo&#8208;polyesters. SEC&#8208;MS analysis revealed that the hydrolysis of aliphatic/aromatic co&#8208;polyesters occurred at the aliphatic monomers, significantly reducing the molecular weight and changing the end&#8208;group composition. These results underline the importance of co&#8208;polymer composition in the biodegradation of co&#8208;polymer systems and demonstrate the applicability of enzymes for the analytical characterization of synthetic polymers by selectively reducing their molecular weight. Finally, the discovery and engineering of highly active enzymes that can efficiently hydrolyze a wide variety of synthetic polyesters create new opportunities for their efficient recycling under mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Borylative Desymmetrization of Multifunctional Haloarenes assisted by Sodium Dispersion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Borylation in the presence of Na dispersion induces desymmetrization of a dihalogenated arene. The monoborylated chlorobenzene, which has rarely been prepared from 1,4&#8208;dichlorobenzene previously in a single operation, is synthesized in a facile manner.







Abstract
Multiply halogenated aromatic compounds were selectively borylated by a boron alkoxide in the presence of sodium dispersion when the reaction was carried out at a low temperature, while multi&#8208;functionalization took place at an elevated temperature. The reaction of 1,4&#8208;dichlorobenzene with sodium dispersion (200&#8211;1200&#8197;mol%) in the presence of isopropyloxyboron pinacolate (120&#8211;240&#8197;mol%) afforded (4&#8208;chlorophenyl)boron pinacolate in up to 84&#8201;% yield. Formation of diborylated product hardly accompanied under the reaction conditions at &#8722;78&#8201;&#176;C for 1&#8197;h.

         <title>Phosphorescent Isocyanide&#8208;Metal&#8208;Carboranyl Complexes of Copper(I) and Gold(I): Synthesis and Radioluminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isocyanide copper(I) and gold(I) complexes (RL)MX (where X=chloride or carboranyl) exhibit photo&#8208; and high&#8208;energy X&#8208;ray radioluminescence with microsecond emission lifetimes.







Abstract
A series of (L)MX (L=isocyanide; M=Cu(I) or Au(I); X=chloride or carboranyl) complexes have been prepared. The first examples of isocyanide Cu(I) chloride complexes with 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 stoichiometry between isocyanide and CuCl are reported and structurally characterised. The photophysical properties of (RNC)AuCl and (RNC)Au(&#951;1&#8208;carboranyl) complexes have been investigated. Complexes (RNC)Au(&#951;1&#8208;carboranyl) show no aurophilic Au&#8722;Au interactions and emit long&#8208;lived deep&#8208;blue phosphorescence up to 377&#8197;&#956;s. The radioluminescence of these gold complexes was studied to show a superior radioluminescence stability for the gold(carboranyl) complexes compared to gold chloride materials under constant high energy X&#8208;ray radiation of 350&#8197;keV.

         <title>A Water&#8208;Stable Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework (HOF) for Selective Sensing of Antibiotics in Aqueous Medium</title>

Strategic design and development of a water&#8208;stable HOF (IITKGP&#8208;HOF&#8208;6) for aqueous medium antibiotic sensing with higher sensitivity, superior selectivity, fast responsivity, and multiple recyclability.







Abstract
Although metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been extensively used as fluorescent&#8208;based antibiotic sensors, newly developed hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are largely unexplored toward this direction. To realize this, the luminescent HOFs must be stable in water as the analytes are mostly found in water&#8208;based effluents in environments. In addition, HOFs should be equipped with specific recognition sites in order to direct the discrimination among the antibiotics. Herein, we report a 3D porous HOF, IITKGP&#8208;HOF&#8208;6, constructed from an aromatic&#8208;rich tetratopic carboxylic acid (H4L), which exhibits excellent hydro and prolonged open&#8208;air stability (7 and 15&#8197;days, respectively). IITKGP&#8208;HOF&#8208;6 was explored for the highly selective detection of nitrofurans (NFs) family of antibiotics in aqueous medium exhibiting a remarkably low detection limit of 0.75&#8197;&#956;M for nitrofurazone (NFZ) through luminescence quenching. Photoinduced electron transfer driven by the presence of low&#8208;lying charge&#8208;transfer excited state below to the

 and Forster energy transfer between H4L donor and NFZ acceptor are confirmed to be responsible for observed quenching using detailed quantum&#8208;chemical studies. This work demonstrates the usage of HOFs as sensory materials toward antibiotics in aqueous medium along with a clear understanding into the sensing mechanism at the molecular level.

         <title>Adjustability and versatility of molecular packing patterns in asymmetric coumarin liquid crystals supramolecular column structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coumarin asymmetric multi&#8208;chain liquid crystals (LCs) were synthesized using click reaction, with coumarin core and 1,2,3&#8208;triazole dendritic wings on both sides. The properties of these LCs and the resulting gels were investigated using polarized optical microscopy (POM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). These polycatenars demonstrate the ability to self&#8208;assemble into columnar LCs phases, exhibiting p4mm symmetry in their bulk states. In DMF solvent, ether compounds yield gels with notably more ordered, spherical flower&#8208;like morphologies, while ester compounds produce gels that are less ordered and exhibit a nanosphere morphology. The findings indicate that the polarities of both the linkages and the solvents play a critical role in the formation of supramolecular nanostructures. Interestingly, the IE3/14 was proved as promising imaging probe for latent fingerprints (LFPs) and fluorescent fingerprints images were obtained with high&#8208;resolution, which showed potential practical application for LFPs detection. Additionally, LCs compounds are used as dopants to modify the poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene (PEDOT:PSS) injection layer of Organic silicone&#8208;based heterojunction solar cells (HSCs). Finally, Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed to theoretically study such as geometric structure, frontier molecular orbitals, molecular electrostatic potential, and dipole moment.</dc:description>

In this work, we report a series of cyclic alkyl&#8208;amino carbene (cAAC) functionalized&#8208; mono and di&#8208;substituted cyclopentadiene rings. The functionalization of the Cp rings with cAAC ligands makes them significantly bulkier, while retaining their ligation properties. These compounds display interesting fluorescence properties displaying intra&#8208;molecular charge transfer from electron&#8208;rich carbene moiety to electron&#8208;deficient cyclopentadiene unit.







Abstract
A series of significantly bulky mono&#8208; and di&#8208;substituted cyclic alkyl&#8208;amino carbene (cAAC)&#8208; functionalized cyclopentadiene ring (Cp) compounds were synthesized. The functionalization of the Cp ring with cAAC ligands makes them significantly bulkier, while retaining their ligation properties. These compounds display interesting fluorescence properties. In these compounds, intra&#8208;molecular charge transfer is observed from electron&#8208;rich carbene to electron&#8208;deficient cyclopentadiene unit. These high yielding compounds have been characterized by X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal diffraction and their emission properties have been studied. Rotational conformers (via C&#8722;C bond rotation) play a pivotal role with possible different extent of intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (ICT) from carbene to cyclopentadiene ring. Variable temperature&#8208;dependent NMR studies were performed along with NOSY, COSY and different 2D NMR techniques to estimate the energy barriers and 1,5&#8208;Hydrogen shift.

         <title>Effect of Halogen Substitution on the Regioselective Deiodination of Thyroid Hormone Analogues by Deiodinase Mimics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper describes the synthesis and NMR spectroscopic studies of various halogen analogues of T4. Deiodination experiments with deiodinase mimics reveal that the regioselectivity or specificity towards iodine atom is not altered upon introduction of more electronegative halogen atoms (F, Cl and Br), reinforcing the concept of halogen bonding in the deiodination reactions.







Abstract
The deiodination of L&#8208;thyroxine (T4) by the three isoforms of selenium&#8208;containing iodothyronine deiodinases (DIOs) is an important process in the human body for the maintenance of the thyroid hormone homeostasis. The 5&#8242;&#8208;deiodination of T4 by DIO1 or DIO2 produces the biologically active hormone 3,5,3&#8242;&#8208;triiodo thyronine (T3) and 5&#8208;deiodination by DIO1 or DIO3 generates 3,3&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;triiodo thyronine (rT3), which is considered to be biologically inactive. Selenium compounds are known to mimic the function of DIO3 by catalyzing the 5&#8208;deiodination of T4 and a co&#8208;operative halogen and chalcogen bonding is responsible for their activity. The substitution of 4&#8242;&#8208;OH group of T4 by an electron withdrawing group not only alters the reactivity but also changes the regioselectivity of deiodination. However, the effect of other halogen atoms (F, Cl or Br) in place of iodine in T4 on the regioselectivity has not been explored. In this paper, we describe simple synthetic methodologies toward various halogen analogues of T4. We also show that 2D NMR spectroscopy can be used as a powerful tool to identify the location of various halogen substitutions on the phenolic or tyrosyl rings. The deiodination experiments with peri&#8208;substituted naphthalene diselenol reveal that the regioselectivity or specificity towards iodine atom is not altered upon introduction of more electronegative halogen atoms (F, Cl and Br), reinforcing the concept of halogen bonding in the deiodination reactions.

The 5&#8242;-deiodination of T4 by DIO1 or DIO2 produces the biologically active hormone 3,5,3&#8242;-triiodo thyronine (T3) and 5-deiodination by DIO1 or DIO3 generates 3,3&#8242;,5&#8242;-triiodo thyronine (rT3), which is considered to be biologically inactive.

         <title>Deciphering and Countering Formic Acid Permeability in Zero&#8208;Gap Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a method for understanding formic acid crossover through Nafion&#8208;separated zero&#8208;gap cells, with and without an applied electric field. In&#8208;situ impedance measurements confirmed diffusion as the primary contributor to permeation. Using a design of experiments, we developed a cost&#8208;effective barrier layer reducing formic acid uptake by 46&#8201;%. These findings may enhance formic acid fuel cells and electrochemical devices.







Abstract
In recent years, formic acid (FA) has garnered attention as a compelling molecule for various chemical and everyday applications. Additionally, with recent studies demonstrating direct FA generation through CO2 electrolysis, it can serve as a stable liquid hydrogen carrier. Nevertheless, FA&#8208;permeability via semi&#8208;permeable ion&#8211;exchange membranes (FA&#8208;crossover) still constitutes a major issue in scalable polymer&#8208;electrolyte separated zero&#8208;gap electrolyzers, limiting the breakthrough of the technology to the larger&#8208;scale. Herein we present a holistic route towards understanding the mechanism of FA&#8208;crossover in zero&#8208;gap electrolyzers. The gained know&#8208;how through formic acid solution uptake, gel&#8208;phase conductivity, and membrane permeability measurements allowed for the development of an easy&#8208;to&#8208;scale barrier layer, showing a FA&#8208;flux (JFA) decrease by 46&#8201;% at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 compared to bare Nafion&#8208;membranes.

         <title>Activation of the Voltage&#8208;Gated Potassium Channel by Amphiphilic Glycopeptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report how synthetic heparan sulfate (HS) and sialic acid glycans on amphiphilic glycopeptides influence cell membrane persistence and modulate Kv2.1 channel gating. Sulfation of HS enhances membrane association and potentiate VGIC activation, highlighting the critical role of glycan structure in VGIC activity.







Abstract
Voltage&#8208;gated ion channels (VGICs) are allosterically modulated by glycosaminoglycan proteoglycans and sialic acid glycans. However, the structural diversity and heterogeneity of these biomolecules pose significant challenges to precisely delineate their underlying structure&#8208;activity relationships. Herein, we demonstrate how heparan sulfate (HS) and sialic acid synthetic glycans appended on amphiphilic glycopeptide backbone influence cell membrane persistence and modulate the gating of the Kv2.1 channel. Utilizing a panel of amphiphilic glycopeptides comprising HS disaccharides and sialic acid trisaccharide glycans, we observed that sulfation of HS and flexible &#945;(2&#8208;6) sialylation result in prolonged persistence of glycopeptides on the cell membrane compared to non&#8208;sulfated HS and &#945;(2&#8211;3) sialylation respective. This variation in glycocalyx composition was associated with a noticeable difference in the effects of these compounds on the activation and deactivation properties of the voltage&#8208;gated Kv2.1 channel with our strongest membrane associating compound demonstrating the most potent channel&#8208;activation propensity. Our findings demonstrate that sulfation charges on glycopeptide play a critical role in their membrane association propensities and endow them with VGIC activation properties. These results provide a valuable insight into the role of cell surface glycans in VGIC activities.

         <title>Exploring the Synthesis and Properties of Fluorinated Cationic Triangulenes and Their Precursors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Partial defluorination of methyl 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorobenzoate led to synthesis of (3,5&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2,6&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl) bis(2,6&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl)&#8208;methylium, which was then used as a precursor to synthesize fluorinated acridiniums, dimethoxyquinacridinium and triangulenes. Fluorination induced red shifts in absorption and emission spectra and enhanced electrophilicity. X&#8208;ray analysis revealed altered packing patterns and formation of molecular dipoles as compared to non&#8208;fluorinated analogues.







Abstract
Fluorination of tris(2,6&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl)&#8208;methylium ((DMP)3C+) was achieved through the partial defluorination of the methyl 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorobenzoate via nucleophilic aromatic substitution. Using the fluorinated 2F((DMP)3C+) as a precursor, fluorinated tetramethoxy&#8208; and dimethoxyquin&#8208; acridinium salts (2F4 and 2F5 respectively) and trioxo&#8208;, azadioxo&#8208;, and diazaoxo&#8208; triangulenium salts (2F6, 2F7 and 2F8 respectively) were synthesized successfully in good to moderate yields. Fluorination induced significant red shifts in absorption (16 to 29&#8197;nm) and emission (13 to 41&#8197;nm) maxima, and increased electrophilicity as evidenced by lower reduction potentials. X&#8208;ray structural analysis showed distinct packing patterns compared to the non&#8208;fluorinated analogues, indicating the presence of molecular dipoles.

Fluorination induced significant red shifts in absorption (16 to 29&#8197;nm) and emission (13 to 41&#8197;nm) maxima, and increased electrophilicity as evidenced by lower reduction potentials. X-ray structural analysis showed distinct packing patterns compared to the non-fluorinated analogues, indicating the presence of molecular dipoles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Identification of Natural Killer Cell Enhancers Through Mimicking of the Tumor Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a pro&#8208;cancerous niche harboring immunosuppressive factors that are secreted by cancer cells and the surrounding cancer&#8208;supportive tissue, such as kynurenine, prostaglandin E2 and transforming growth factor &#946; (TGF&#946;). These factors dampen the activity of cytotoxic lymphocytes like natural killer (NK) cells, allowing evasion of immune cell&#8208;mediated killing. To identify small molecules that counteract the immunosuppressive effect of the TME and restore NK cell&#8208;mediated cytotoxicity, we developed a phenotypic co&#8208;culture assay of cancer cells and primary lymphocytes suitable for medium&#8208;throughput screening. We discovered small molecules that restore NK cell&#8208;mediated cytotoxicity through diverse mechanisms. The potent TGF&#946; type I receptor (TGF&#946;R&#8208;1) inhibitor, RepSox, stood out as superior to other TGF&#946;R&#8208;1 inhibitors due to its ability to abolish the effects of both inhibitory factors used in our setup. This mode of action goes beyond
TGF&#946;R&#8208;1 inhibition and is related to the simultaneous abrogation of cyclooxygenase 1 (COX1) activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Peripheral Modification Strategy of Heavy Atom for High&#8208;Performance Multi&#8208;Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic light&#8208;emitting materials with multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) have shown great potential for realizing highly efficient narrowband organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, the heavy efficiency roll&#8208;off caused by the slow reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process remains a challenging issue for the further practical application of MR&#8208;TADF materials. Here, we develop two TADF emitters, BNDBT and BNDBF, in which the dibenzothiophene and dibenzofuran substituents are attached at the bottom of the B/N frameworks. They all exhibit the similar high photoluminescence quantum yields of 90% and 87%. The sulfur&#8208;containing material BNDBT exhibits a RISC rate (kRISC) of 6.02&#8201;&#215;&#8201;104&#8201;s&#8722;1, which is three&#8208;folded higher than BNDBF (2.09&#8201;&#215;&#8201;104&#8201;s&#8722;1) without heavy atom. The corresponding green OLED based on BNDBT exhibits an improved external quantum efficiency of 35.5% and lower efficiency roll&#8208;offs at high brightnesses of 100&#8201;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 and 1000&#8201;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, respectively. In addition, the BNDBT&#8208;based OLED maintains high color purity without causing a sharp increase in FWHM as compared with that of BNDBF. This work indicates that introducing the heavy atom at the bottom of the B/N skeleton is an effective strategy to enhance kRISC while maintaining narrow FWHM, thereby achieving high&#8208;performance MR&#8208;TADF emitters.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A solvent&#8208;free synthesis of valuable monofluoroalkenes was developed under ball&#8208;milling agitation. The use of 1.0 equivalent of carbonyl substrates and 1.1 equivalent of fluorophosphonoacetate derivatives with a weak inorganic base enabled the formation of the desired products after 30 min of reaction under sustainable conditions with minimized synthetic waste. No sequential addition of base, fluorophosphonate, and carbonyl substrates was needed, and the desired products were obtained with high purity only after a simple filtration. The protocol showed general efficiency and tolerance to a large panel of carbonyl substrates including aldehydes and ketones, as well as fluorophosphonoacetate derivatives with moderate stereoselectivities and yields ranging from 21 % to 99 % (48 examples).</dc:description>

         <title>Doubly Linked Azulene Dimer: A Novel Non&#8208;benzenoid Isomer of Perylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new non&#8208;benzenoid isomer of perylene described as a doubly linked azulene dimer has been successfully synthesized. This compound exhibits not only the reversible redox behaviors and p&#8208;type semiconductivity but also one of the narrowest values of the optical band gap among the hitherto reported non&#8208;benzenoid PAHs.







Abstract
We report herein the synthesis of an unprecedented isomer of perylene, dicyclohepta[cd,fg]&#8208;as&#8208;indacene bearing two phenyl groups (1&#8208;Ph) by the nickel&#8208;mediated intramolecular homocoupling of a 4,4&#8217;&#8208;biazulene derivative (2). The X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and theoretical calculations revealed that 1&#8208;Ph adopts a unique helically twisted geometry although the local aromaticity of azulene moieties was preserved. The double covalent linkage of the two azulene skeletons imparts significant orbital interaction, which affords near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption (up to 1720&#8197;nm) and remarkable redox behaviors despite its closed&#8208;shell electronic structure. The optical band gap of 1&#8208;Ph is calculated to be 0.72&#8197;eV from its absorption onset, which is one of the narrowest values among the hitherto reported air&#8208;stable non&#8208;benzenoid PAHs. Furthermore, the thin&#8208;film of 1&#8208;Ph serves as a p&#8208;type semiconductor. Our study offers fundamental insights into not only the aromaticity with the nonalternant topologies of 1&#8208;Ph but also its potential application in novel organic electronics.

         <title>Physicochemical Properties of New Ionic Liquids and Plastic Crystal Based on Huckel Anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To achieve optimal properties in organic ionic plastic crystals (OIPCs) and ionic liquids (ILs), new cations and anions must be investigated. A novel series of ILs and OIPC based on Huckel&#8208;type anions were synthesised and characterised.







Abstract
There is increasing interest in ionic liquid electrolytes for battery applications due to their potential as safer alternatives to conventional liquid electrolytes. By carefully selecting cations and anions, the physicochemical properties of these salts can be optimised. However, investigation of new cations and anions is still required to achieve the desired electrolyte properties such as high conductivity, electrochemical stability and low corrosivity. Thus, here a new series of room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) and an organic ionic plastic crystal (OIPC) were synthesized and characterized based on N&#8722;ethyl&#8722;N&#8722;methylpyrrolidinium ([C2mpyr]+) and N&#8722;ethyl&#8722;N&#8722;methyloxazolidinium ([C2moxa]+) cations, paired with 4,5&#8208;dicyano&#8208;2&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)imidazolide ([TDI]&#8722;) and 4,5&#8208;dicyano&#8208;2&#8208;(pentafluoroethyl)imidazolide ([PDI]&#8722;) anions, forming [C2mpyr][TDI] (OIPC), [C2mpyr][PDI] (IL), [C2moxa][TDI] (IL), and [C2moxa][PDI] (IL). Thermal properties were analysed using DSC and TGA.

     alt="Physicochemical Properties of New Ionic Liquids and Plastic Crystal Based on Huckel Anions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve optimal properties in organic ionic plastic crystals (OIPCs) and ionic liquids (ILs), new cations and anions must be investigated. A novel series of ILs and OIPC based on Huckel-type anions were synthesised and characterised.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is increasing interest in ionic liquid electrolytes for battery applications due to their potential as safer alternatives to conventional liquid electrolytes. By carefully selecting cations and anions, the physicochemical properties of these salts can be optimised. However, investigation of new cations and anions is still required to achieve the desired electrolyte properties such as high conductivity, electrochemical stability and low corrosivity. Thus, here a new series of room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) and an organic ionic plastic crystal (OIPC) were synthesized and characterized based on &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8722;ethyl&#8722;&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8722;methylpyrrolidinium ([C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;mpyr]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8722;ethyl&#8722;&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8722;methyloxazolidinium ([C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;moxa]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) cations, paired with 4,5-dicyano-2-(trifluoromethyl)imidazolide ([TDI]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) and 4,5-dicyano-2-(pentafluoroethyl)imidazolide ([PDI]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) anions, forming [C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;mpyr][TDI] (OIPC), [C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;mpyr][PDI] (IL), [C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;moxa][TDI] (IL), and [C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;moxa][PDI] (IL). Thermal properties were analysed using DSC and TGA. The plastic phase of the OIPC [C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;mpyr][TDI] is wide and spans most electrolyte application temperatures, extending from &#8722;40&#8197;to&#8197;56&#8201;&#176;C. All salts exhibit thermal stability above 200&#8201;&#176;C. The temperature dependence of the transport properties (viscosity, ionic conductivity, self-diffusion coefficient) were measured and fitted by the Vogel-Fulcher-Tamman (VFT) equation, and the ionicity of the ILs is reported. The electrochemical stability windows of the salts were analysed by CV, and the [C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;mpyr]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cation-based ILs showed the widest window of ~5&#8201;V.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cucurbit[8]Uril&#8208;Stabilized Charge Transfer: An Efficient Supramolecular Approach Toward a Heterogeneous Organic Photocatalyst for Aerobic Oxidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The host&#8211;guest complexes of cucurbit[8]uril (Q[8]) with viologen derivatives in aqueous solution could be switched by the substituted electron donor moieties, where the host&#8208;guest complexes exhibited effective HSCT interactions. Control experiments revealed that d&#8208;BPV2+@Q[8] complex as heterogeneous catalysts has the stronger ability to sensitize singlet oxygen (1O2) in organic solvents.







Abstract
Host&#8208;stabilized charge transfer (HSCT) has been widely utilized in macrocycle&#8208;derived supramolecular assemblies and architectures. However, there has been less research attention focused on the direct fabrication of pure organic photocatalysts using HSCT. Herein, four viologen derivatives (m&#8208;PV2+, m&#8208;BPV2+, d&#8208;PV2+, and d&#8208;BPV2+) with different electron donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) structures were synthesized. Their host&#8208;guest complexes with cucurbit[8]uril (Q[8]) in an aqueous solution could be switched using the substituted electron donor moieties, in which the host&#8208;guest complexes of m&#8208;BPV2+@Q[8] and d&#8208;BPV2+@Q[8] exhibited HSCT interactions. Control experiments revealed that the d&#8208;BPV2+@Q[8] complex had the strongest ability to sensitize singlet oxygen (1O2). This was ascribed to the increased &#960;&#8208;conjugation of d&#8208;BPV2+@Q[8], which led to more effective HSCT upon encapsulation by the Q[8] host. Consequently, the d&#8208;BPV2+@Q[8] complex could be easily employed as a heterogeneous photocatalyst for the photooxidation reaction of thioether com&#8208;pounds with high selectivity. In particular, d&#8208;BPV2+@Q[8] was successfully applied to the synthesis of sulfoxide drugs, such as the con&#8208;version of inexpensive Iberverin ($7.0 per gram) to the expensive bioactive inhibitor Iberin ($19500.0 per gram) in high yield (94&#8201;%).

         <title>Optimization of Catalytic Soot Oxidation by 3DOM Perovskite&#8208;Type La0.5&#8208;xKxSr0.5CoO3&#8208;&#948; Catalysts: Structural Insights and K Substitution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of 3DOM La0.5&#8208;xKxSr0.5CoO3&#8208;&#948; catalysts were synthesized using colloidal crystal templating and citric acid complexation methods. The substitution of K ions for A&#8208;site La ions was found to markedly enhance the catalysts' intrinsic activity, with the La0.4K0.1Sr0.5CoO3&#8208;&#948; catalyst showing exceptional performance comparable to commercial precious metal catalysts. The La0.4K0.1Sr0.5CoO3&#8208;&#948; catalyst demonstrated the highest catalytic activity, with T10, T50, and T90 values of 280&#176;C, 335&#176;C, and 387&#176;C, respectively. The enhancement in intrinsic activity is primarily attributed to the electron&#8208;donating effect of K ions which maintains charge conservation and consequently increases the concentration of surface oxygen vacancies, leading to the formation of abundant active oxygen species. Additionally, the catalysts exhibited a highly ordered macroporous structure with interconnected pores, facilitating the diffusion of soot particles and enhancing contact efficiency with active sites. These findings not only advance the understanding of the structure&#8208;performance relationship in perovskite catalysts but also pave the way for the development of cost&#8208;effective catalysts for low&#8208;temperature soot abatement.</dc:description>

         <title>Spin Crossover Composite Film as Recyclable Catalyst for Acetalization Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymer&#8208;based composite films represent a promising approach for developing recyclable catalysts. In this study, a [Fe(NH2trz)3](NO3)2 @TPU composite film with spin crossover properties was fabricated using the blade casting method. Various characterisation techniques confirmed the uniform distribution of [Fe(NH2trz)3](NO3)2 particles within the TPU matrix, while maintaining the spin&#8208;crossover properties of the embedded complex. The composite film exhibited excellent catalytic efficiency and reusability in acetalization reaction, enabling efficient catalysis for up to 11 cycles under batch conditions and sustained activity for 7 hours under flow conditions. In addition, the color of the film served as a convenient visual indicator of its suitability for reuse in subsequent catalytic reactions. This study demonstrates that [Fe(NH2trz)3](NO3)2 @TPU composite film can serve as an effective and recyclable catalysts for acetalization reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Redox Divergent Hydrated Ring Expansion of Butafulvenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By providing highly functionalized building blocks in an efficient approach, catalytic hydration of alkenes plays a significant role in fundamental chemical transformations and pharmaceutical synthesis. However, hydration reactions have predominantly involved water and alkenes double bond alignment. Herein, we developed a regio&#8208; and redox divergent hydrated ring expansion protocol of butafulvenes. With the aid of PdII or acid catalysis, various highly functionalized and unsaturated cyclopentanone derivatives could be obtained in high regioselectivities under oxidative or redox neutral conditions. Isotope labeling experiments suggest that the carbonylic oxygen atom of target product is derived from water. In addition, the unsaturated cyclopentanone intermediate could undergo divergent transformations and serve as a key molecule to create skeletal editing compounds of butafulvenes via one&#8208;pot protocol, which highlights the potential applications of this strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding the Nitrogen Reduction Reaction Mechanism on CuFeO2&#160;Photocathodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study investigates the reaction pathways for the conversion of N2&#160;to NH3&#160;on CuFeO2&#160;(CFO) by employing density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Concentrating on the most stable (012) surface orientation, two systems were examined: the pristine (012) surface and the corresponding oxygen defective surface. To find the thermodynamic stable pathway, the associative Heyrovsk&#253;&#160;mechanism was considered, containing four different reaction pathways.&#160; The reaction intermediates predominantly interact with the iron sites on the surface, following the distal alternating reaction pathway via the formation of hydrazine. Introducing oxygen defects changes the reaction mechanism to a Mars&#8208;van&#8208;Krevelen&#8208;type mechanism, avoiding the formation of hydrazine, while the Gibbs free energy of the first hydrogenation step is lowered by 1.17 eV (from 2.17 to 1.00 eV). Analyzing the charge density distribution reveals that oxygen defective surface enables CFO to facilitate a &#960;&#8208;backdonation between iron sites and the NRR intermediates, increasing the intermediate&#8208;surface interaction. This indicates an enhanced catalytic activity for the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) by generating oxygen lattice defects in CFO.</dc:description>

         <title>NXS/TBHP as a Reagent System for Expedient Generation of Halogen Radicals: Site&#8208;Selective Halogenation of Quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones and Conversion of Terminal Alkynes to gem&#8208;Dihaloketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report an efficient and practical protocol for the generation of halogen (Br and Cl) radicals using inexpensive and readily available N&#8208;bromo/N&#8208;chlorosuccinimide (NXS) and t&#8208;butylhydroperoxide (TBHP) at rt. The NXS/TBHP reagent systems are demonstrated for site&#8208;selective bromination and chlorination of the benzene&#8208;core of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones. It is shown that the reagent system permits regioselective halogenation at the C7 position of the benzene core over the readily&#8208;functionalized C3 position of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones under mild reaction conditions. We further show that terminal alkynes can be converted to gem&#8208;dihaloketones in a facile manner by NXS/TBHP. Mechanistically, single electron transfer between TBHP and NXS leads to instantaneous formation of electrophilic halogen radicals, which attack arenes and alkynes.</dc:description>

         <title>Implicating the Role of Au&#8208;H Bonds in Photochemical N2 Fixation by Ruthenium Doped Gold Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dinitrogen fixation through the Nitrogen Reduction Reaction (NRR) under mild conditions without the use of sacrificial agents has its share of formidable hurdles. It has been shown recently that Ru&#8208;doped Au nanoclusters can reduce N2 molecule to NH3 only in the presence of UV&#8208;Vis light in aqueous medium. Herein, using theoretical techniques (Density Functional Theory) we shed light on the mechanistic avenues traversed for achieving this prodigious chemical feat. Our findings suggest that the bimetallic Au22Ru6 cluster successfully accomplishes the NRR process under ambient pressure and temperature conditions by the very virtue of its bifunctional nature. Contrary to the existing views, we find that NRR propagates through an alternative associative pathway, where the Ru dopant assists in N2 adsorption while the Au&#8208;H bonds formed from Au assisted water splitting is implicated for facilitating NRR.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Interpenetrated Faujasite&#8208;like Crystals from [4+4] Imine Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, porous organic cages have gained in importance, inter alia, due to their ability to be processed from solution. Especially the packing of the cages in the solid state structure has a significant effect on the porosity. Therefore, it is important to be able control the packing pattern either by crystallization conditions or the interaction of molecular units, defined as crystal engineering synthons. Here, tribromoarene subunits as such are incorporated into cage structures, namely a [2+3] and a [4+4] imine cages, to study the reliability of thus subunit as crystal engineering synthon. Several solvatomorphs of both cages were studied by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and packing patterns thoroughly analyzed. Among those solvatomorphs an interpenetrated Faujasite&#8208;type supramolecular arrangement is found.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of a Highly Selective Synthesis of 4&#8211;Substituted Tetrahydroquinolines: Substrate Scope and Mechanistic Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe a general and selective deprotonation functionalization reaction of tetrahydroquinolines at the 4&#8211;position using organolithiums and phosphoramide ligands. In addition to the development of a direct deprotonation alkylation reaction with primary and secondary alkyl halides, a Negishi cross&#8211;coupling protocol was realized to afford products with a range of aromatic halides. These methods were applied to the late&#8208;stage installation of tetrahydroquinolines into a variety of substrates including pharmaceuticals as well as natural product analogues. The use of thorough mechanistic investigations revealed the aggregation state of the newly formed tetrahydroquinoline anion to be a separated ion pair, which proved critical to optimizing the reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal Exchange in Thioguanosine Coordination Polymers of Gold (I) and Silver (I)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterometallic coordination polymers of Au(I) and Ag(I) with 6&#8208;thioguanosine, poly([AuxAg1&#8208;x(6&#8722;tG)]), have been prepared and were observed to form hydrogels. We find that the composition of the heterometallic polymer is proportional to&#160;the mole fractions of the metals in the preparation solution. Optical absorption spectra show single peaks for &#955; &gt; 300 nm which can be interpolated in a linear manner between x = 0.0 and x = 1.0 consistent with the formation of a heterometallic polymer rather than a mixture of homopolymers. However photoluminescence and circular dichroism spectra are sensitive to the supramolecular structure of the polymers and show more complex behaviour. Atomic force microscopy indicated that the molecular chains of the Au homopolymer entwine to form strands that are predominantly right&#8208;hand helices. The&#160;Ag homopolymer&#160;has previously been shown to form left&#8208;hand helices. Intermediate compositions have more complex structures because of the competition between the left and right&#8208;handed preferences of the homopolymers. Finally, we have shown that the metal&#8208;ligand bonds are labile on a timescale of about 5 h at ambient temperature (about 293 K). Mixtures of homopolymers transform to the corresponding heterometallic coordination polymer by metal exchange as judged by optical absorption, photoluminescence and circular dichroism spectra.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective On&#8208;Surface Metalation and Uncommon Reordering of Self&#8208;Assembled Macrocyclic Biquinazoline Ligands on Ag(111)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The macrocyclic biquinazoline ligand, H&#8208;Mabiq, presents a central and a peripheral site for the coordination of metal ions, making the adsorption on solid surfaces promising for the creation of self&#8208;assembled bimetallic two&#8208;dimensional platforms. Here, we apply an on&#8208;surface metalation strategy under ultra&#8208;high vacuum conditions to guide the synthesis of metalated species and study sequential metalation patterns. We find that cobalt (as well as iron) metalation on the Ag(111) surface preferentially occurs at the macrocyclic centre without further metal coordination to the peripheral site. Nevertheless, starting from a densely packed, self&#8208;assembled H&#8208;Mabiq monolayer, the modification of the central cavity by Co is accompanied by an unusual, metalation&#8208;induced phase transformation which gives evidence of modified lateral / interfacial interactions. The selective metalation of one molecular site opens up an on&#8208;surface route to create bimetallic networks incorporating select metal ions at different locations.</dc:description>
