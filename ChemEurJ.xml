      <title>A Six&#8208;coordinate Silicon Dihydride Embedded in a Porphyrin: Enhanced Hydride&#8208;donor Properties and the Catalyst&#8208;free Hydrosilylation of CO2</title>
      <dc:description>The catalyst&#8208;free hydrosilylation of CO  2  under mild conditions remains limited. Herein, we report the synthesis, characterization, and reactivity of 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrinato(dihydrido)silicon(IV) (  1  ) as a six&#8208;coordinate silicon dihydride.

      <title>Charge&#8208;Separated and Lewis Paired Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Anion Exchange and CO2 Chemical Fixation</title>
      <dc:description>Charge&#8208;separated metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are a unique class of MOFs that can possess added properties originating from the exposed ionic species. We report a new charge&#8208;separated MOF, namely UNM&#8208;6, synthesized from a tetrahedral borate ligand and Co 2+ cation. UNM&#8208;6 crystalizes into the highly symmetric P&#8208;43n space group with four&#8208;fold interpenetration, despite the stoichiometric imbalance between the B and Co atoms, which also leads to loosely bound NO 3 &#8722; anions within the crystal structure. These NO 3 &#8722; ions can be quantitatively exchanged with various other anions, leading to Lewis acid (Co 2+ ) and Lewis base (anions) pairs within the pores and potentially cooperative catalytic activities. For example, UNM&#8208;6&#8208;Br, the MOF after anion exchange with Br &#8722; anions, displays high catalytic activity and stability in reactions of CO 2 chemical fixation into cyclic carbonates.</dc:description>

      <title>Long&#8208;range LMCT coupling in Eu(III) coordination polymers for an effective molecular luminescent thermometer</title>
      <dc:description>A design for an effective molecular luminescent thermometer based on long&#8208;range electronic coupling in lanthanide coordination polymers is proposed. The coordination polymers are composed of lanthanide ions Eu(III) and Gd(III), three anionic ligands (hexafluoroacetylacetonate), and a chrysene&#8208;based phosphine oxide bridges (6,12&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphoryl)chrysene). The zig&#8208;zag orientation of the single polymer chains induces the formation of packed coordination structures containing multiple sites for CH&#8208;F intermolecular interactions, resulting in thermal stability above 350 &#730;C. The electronic coupling is controlled by changing the concentration of the Gd(III) ion in the Eu(III)&#8208;Gd(III) polymer. The emission quantum yield and the maximum relative temperature sensitivity (  S  m  ) of emission lifetimes for the Eu(III)&#8208;Gd(III) polymer (Eu:Gd = 1:1,  &#934;  tot  = 52%,  S  m  = 3.73% K  &#8208;1  ) were higher than those for the pure Eu(III) coordination polymer (  &#934;  tot  = 36%,  S  m  = 2.70% K  &#8208;1  ), respectively.

      <title>New reactivity patterns in 3H&#8208;phosphaallene chemistry [Aryl&#8208;P=C=C(H)&#8208;tBu] &#8211; hydroboration of the C=C bond, deprotonation and trimerisation</title>
      <dc:description>3H&#8208;Phosphaallenes, R&#8208;P=C=C(H)&#8208;R&#8217; (  3  ), are accessible in a multigram scale on a new and facile route and show a fascinating chemical reactivity. BH  3  (SMe  2  ) and  3a  (R = Mes*, R&#8217; =  t  Bu) afforded by hydroboration of the C=C bonds of two phosphaallene molecules an unprecedented borane (  7  ) with the B atom bound to two P=C double bonds. This compound represents a new FLP based on a B and two P atoms. The increased Lewis acidity of the B atom led to a different reaction course upon treatment of  3a  with H  2  B&#8208;C  6  F  5  (SMe  2  ). Hydroboration of a C=C bound of a first phosphaallene is followed in a typical FLP reaction by the coordination of a second phosphaallene molecule via B&#8208;C and P&#8208;B bond formation to yield a BP  2  C  2  heterocycle (  8  ). Its B&#8208;P bond is short and the B bound P atom has a planar surrounding. Treatment of  3a  with  t  BuLi resulted in deprotonation of the &#946;&#8208;C atom of the phosphaallene (  9  ). The Li atom is bound to the P atom as demonstrated by crystal structure determination, quantum chemical calculations and reactions with HCl, Cl&#8208;SiMe  3  or Cl&#8208;P  t  Bu  2  . The thermally unstable phosphaallene Ph&#8208;P=C=C(H)&#8208;  t  Bu gave a unique trimeric secondary product by P&#8208;P, P&#8208;C and C&#8208;C bond formation.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;3H&#8208;Phosphaallenes, R&#8208;P=C=C(H)&#8208;R&#8217; (  3  ), are accessible in a multigram scale on a new and facile route and show a fascinating chemical reactivity. BH  3  (SMe  2  ) and  3a  (R = Mes*, R&#8217; =  t  Bu) afforded by hydroboration of the C=C bonds of two phosphaallene molecules an unprecedented borane (  7  ) with the B atom bound to two P=C double bonds. This compound represents a new FLP based on a B and two P atoms. The increased Lewis acidity of the B atom led to a different reaction course upon treatment of  3a  with H  2  B&#8208;C  6  F  5  (SMe  2  ). Hydroboration of a C=C bound of a first phosphaallene is followed in a typical FLP reaction by the coordination of a second phosphaallene molecule via B&#8208;C and P&#8208;B bond formation to yield a BP  2  C  2  heterocycle (  8  ).

      <title>Hexayne Amphiphiles and Bolaamphiphiles</title>
      <dc:description>
Surfactants worth the sacrifice: Amphiphilic and bolaamphiphilic functional hexaynes were synthesized using the Egliton&#8211;Galbraith reaction and a sacrificial monomer. The novel carbon&#8208;rich surfactants form aggregates in water, monolayers on surfaces, and stabilize the liquid&#8211;liquid interface.







Abstract
Oligoynes with two or more conjugated carbon&#8211;carbon triple bonds are useful precursors for carbon&#8208;rich nanomaterials. However, their range of applications has so far been severely limited by the challenging syntheses, particularly in the case of oligoynes with functional groups. Here, we report a universal synthetic approach towards both symmetric and unsymmetric, functionalized hexaynes through the use of a modified Eglinton&#8211;Galbraith coupling and a sacrificial building block. We demonstrate the versatility of this approach by preparing hexaynes functionalized with phosphonic acid, carboxylic acid, ammonium, or thiol head groups, which serve as neutral, cationogenic, or anionogenic interfacially active groups. We show that these hexaynes are carbon&#8208;rich amphiphiles or bolaamphiphiles that self&#8208;assemble at liquid&#8211;liquid interfaces, on solid surfaces, as well as in aqueous media.

      <title>S&#8208;shaped para&#8208;Quinodimethane Embedded Double [6]Helicene and Its Charged Species Showing Open&#8208;shell Diradical Character</title>
      <dc:description>Helicenes and extended helical &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules have been widely studied, but most of the systems contain aromatic benzene or heterocyclic rings only, showing local aromatic character. Herein, we report a new S&#8208;shaped double [6]helicene molecule 1 which possesses two embedded para&#8208;quinodimethane (p&#8208;QDM) units. Due to the existence of proaromatic quinoidal substructure, the molecule exhibits unique open&#8208;shell diradical character. Its model compound, a C&#8208;shaped single [6]helicene 2 containing one p&#8208;QDM unit, was also synthesized and compared. Their ground&#8208;state structures and electronic properties were systematically studied by a combination of various experimental methods assisted by theoretical calculations. Compound 1 has a double helical structure in crystal, with the two terminal [6]helicene units bent to opposite directions (i.e., anti&#8208; form). However, an anti&#8208;/syn&#8208; isomerization process was observed on NMR time scale, with a moderate interconversion energy barrier. Compound 1 shows amphoteric redox behaviour. It also exhibits open&#8208;shell diradical character (y0 = 12.1%) and a small singlet&#8208;triplet gap. On the other hand, compound 2 displays typical closed&#8208;shell nature.&#160; The dication and dianion of 1 also show open&#8208;shell diradical character. The dianion of 2 and the tetranion of 1 exhibit similar electronic structures to their respective isoelectronic structures, the [6]helicene and a double [6]helicene. This work provides some insights into the design and synthesis of stable helical &#960;&#8208;systems with unique open&#8208;shell diradical character and magnetic activity.</dc:description>

      <title>Light Runs Across Iron Catalysts in Organic Transformations</title>
      <dc:description>Over the past decades, organometallic complexes with precious elements, such as ruthenium and iridium, were widely used as visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysts. Recently, more and more complexes based on earth&#8208;abundant and inexpensive elements have been used as sensitizers in photochemistry. Although the photoexcited state lifetimes of iron complexes are typically shorter than those of traditional photosensitizers, the utilization of iron catalysts in photochemistry has sprung up due to their abundance, low price, nontoxicity and novel properties, including exhibiting ligand to metal charge transfer states. This concept focuses on recent advance of light&#8208;driven iron&#8208;catalysis in organic transformations, including iron/photoredox dual catalysis, light&#8208;induced iron photoredox catalysis and light&#8208;induced generation of active iron catalysts. The prospect for future of this field is also discussed.</dc:description>

      <title>Total Synthesis of Mallotusinin</title>
      <dc:description>We describe the total synthesis of mallotusinin that bears a tetrahydroxydibenzofuranoyl (THDBF) bridge between the 2&#8208;oxygen and 4&#8208;oxygen of glucose on corilagin with a 3,6&#8208;  O  &#8208;(  R  )&#8208;hexahydroxydiphenoyl (HHDP) bridge.

      <title>Polymer&#8208;assisted electrophoretic synthesis of N&#8208;doped graphene&#8208;polypyrrole demonstrating oxygen reduction reaction with excellent methanol crossover impact and durability</title>
      <dc:description>The design and synthesis of the metal&#8208;free catalysts having superior electrocatalytic activity, high durability, low cost and under mild conditions is extremely desirable but remains challenging. To address this problem, we report a polymer assisted electrochemical exfoliation technique of graphite in the presence of aqueous acidic medium. This simple, cost&#8208;effective and mass scale production approach could open a possibility for the synthesis of high&#8208;quality nitrogen doped graphene&#8208;polypyrrole (NG&#8208;PPy). The NG&#8208;PPy catalyst displays an improved half wave potential (E1/2 = 0.77 V) in alkaline medium than G&#8208;PPy (E1/2 = 0.66 V). Most importantly, this catalyst demonstrating excellent stability with high methanol tolerance, which is outperforming the commercial Pt/C catalyst and few other previously reported metal&#8208;free catalysts. The content of graphitic nitrogen atoms is the key factor for the enhancement of electrocatalytic activity towards oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). Interestingly, the NG&#8208;PPy catalyst is used as a cathode material in a zinc&#8722;air battery, which demonstrates a higher peak power density (59 mW cm&#8722;2) than G&#8208;PPy (36.6 mW cm&#8722;2), which is broadcasting the importance of the low&#8208;cost material synthesis approach towards the development of metal&#8208;free efficient ORR catalysts for fuel cell and metal air battery applications. Remarkably, the polymer assisted electrophoretic exfoliation of graphite with high yield (~88 wt %) of few layers of graphene flakes could pave the path towards mass production of high&#8208;quality graphene for a variety of applications</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The interest for ratiometric luminescent probes that detect and quantify a specific analyte is growing. Due to their special luminescence properties, lanthanide(III) cations offer attractive opportunities for the design of dual&#8208;color ratiometric probes.

Two zinc&#8208;responsive probes, r&#8208;LZF1Tb|Cs124|Eu and r&#8208;LZF1Eu|Cs124|Tb are described on the basis of a zinc finger peptide and two DOTA complexes of terbium and europium. Both display dual&#8208;color ratiometric emission responding to the presence of Zn2+. Using a screening approach, anthracene was identified for the sensitization of the luminescence of two near infrared&#8208;emitting lanthanides, Yb3+ and Nd3+. Thus, two novel zinc&#8208;responsive hetero&#8208;bis&#8208;lanthanide probes, r&#8208;LZF3Yb|Anthra|Nd and r&#8208;LZF3Nd|Anthra|Yb were assembled, the former offering a neat ratiometric response to Zn2+ with emission in the near&#8208;infrared around 1000 nm, which is unprecedented.</dc:description>

      <title>Azatruxene&#8208;Based, Dumbbell&#8208;Shaped, Donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Bridge&#8208;Donor Hole&#8208;Transporting Materials for Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>Three novel donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;bridge&#8208;donor (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D) hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) featuring triazatruxene electron&#8208;donating units bridged by different 3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) &#960;&#8208;conjugated linkers have been synthesized, characterized, and implemented in mesoporous perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The opto&#8208;electronic properties of the new dumbbell&#8208;shaped derivatives (DTTXs) are highly influenced by the chemical structure of the EDOT&#8208;based linker. Red&#8208;shifted absorption and emission and a stronger donor ability were observed in passing from DTTX&#8208;1 to DTTX&#8208;2 due to the extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation. DTTX&#8208;3 featured an intramolecular charge transfer between the external triazatruxene units and the azomethine&#8208;EDOT central scaffold, resulting in a more pronounced red shift.

These PCE values are in perfect agreement with the conductivity and hole mobility values determined for the new compounds and spiro&#8208;OMeTAD.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Three novel donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;bridge&#8208;donor (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D) hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) featuring triazatruxene electron&#8208;donating units bridged by different 3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) &#960;&#8208;conjugated linkers have been synthesized, characterized, and implemented in mesoporous perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The opto&#8208;electronic properties of the new dumbbell&#8208;shaped derivatives (DTTXs) are highly influenced by the chemical structure of the EDOT&#8208;based linker. Red&#8208;shifted absorption and emission and a stronger donor ability were observed in passing from DTTX&#8208;1 to DTTX&#8208;2 due to the extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation. DTTX&#8208;3 featured an intramolecular charge transfer between the external triazatruxene units and the azomethine&#8208;EDOT central scaffold, resulting in a more pronounced red shift. The three new derivatives have been tested in combination with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art triple&#8208;cation perovskite [(FAPbI3)0.87(MAPbBr3)0.13]0.92[CsPbI3]0.08 in standard mesoporous PSCs.

      <dc:description>Based on recent examples and initiatives reported in the literature, this concept article discusses how chemistry can contribute to the circular economy approach in order to improve our current and future economical, societal and environmental system. Through five proposed levels of contribution, chemists can take a significant part in this global approach via the consideration of green chemistry principles, the simplification of syntheses, the limitation of complex products preparation, the efficient utilization of resources but also the novel ways of waste valorization. A more systematic and generalized environmental and economic assessment from the lab&#8208;scale is also recommended.

      <title>Mechanism of Iodine(III)&#8208;Promoted Oxidative Dearomatizing Hydroxylation of Phenols: Evidence for Radical&#8208;Chain Pathway</title>
      <dc:description>The oxidative dearomatization of phenols with the addition of nucleophiles to the aromatic ring induced by hypervalent iodine(III) reagents and catalysts has emerged as a highly useful synthetic approach. However, experimental mechanistic studies of this important process have been extremely scarce. In this report, we describe systematic investigations of the dearomatizing hydroxylation of phenols using an array of experimental techniques. Kinetics, EPR spectroscopy, and reactions with radical probes demonstrate that the transformation proceeds via a radical&#8208;chain mechanism, with a phenoxyl radical being the key chain&#8208;carrying intermediate. Moreover, UV and NMR spectroscopy, high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry, and cyclic voltammetry show that before reacting with the phenoxyl radical, water molecule becomes activated by the interaction with the iodine(III) center, causing the  Umpolung  of this formally nucleophilic substrate. The radical&#8208;chain mechanism allows to rationalize all existing observations regarding the iodine(III)&#8208;promoted oxidative dearomatization of phenols.</dc:description>

      <title>Tuning the cell uptake and subcellular distribution in BODIPY&#8208;carboranyl dyads: An experimental and theoretical study.</title>
      <dc:description>A set of BODIPY&#8208;carboranyl dyads synthesized by a Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reaction, where different C&#8208;substituted ortho&#8208; and meta&#8208;carboranyl fragments have been linked to a BODIPY fluorophore is described. Chemical, photophysical and physicochemical analyses are presented, including NMR and SXRD experiments, optical absorption/emission studies and log P measurements. These studies, supported by DFT computations (M06&#8208;2X/6&#8208;31G**) provide an explanation to the largely divergent cell income that these fluorescent carboranyl&#8208;based fluorophores display, for which a structural or physicochemical explanation remains elusive. By studying the cell uptake efficiency and subcellular localization for our set of dyads on living HeLa cells, we tracked the origins of these differences to significant variations in their static dipole moments and partition coefficients, which tune their ability to interact with lipophilic microenvironments in cells. Remarkably, m&#8208;carboranyl&#8208;BODIPY derivatives with a higher lipophilicity are much better internalised by cells than their homologous with o&#8208;carborane, suggesting that m&#8208;isomers are potentially better theranostic agents for in vitro bioimaging and boron carriers for BNCT.</dc:description>

      <title>On the Structure and Chiral Aggregation of Liquid Crystalline Star&#8208;Shaped Triazines H&#8208;Bonded to Benzoic Acids</title>
      <dc:description>The ability of a star&#8208;shaped tris(triazolyl)triazine derivative to hierarchically build supramolecular chiral columnar organizations through the formation of 1:3 H&#8208;bonded complexes with benzoic acids was studied from a theoretical and experimental point of view. Although the star&#8208;shaped triazine core crystallizes in a non&#8208;  C  3  conformation, the  C  3  &#8208;symmetric conformation is theoretically predicted to be more stable and gives rise to a favourable  C  3  supramolecular 1:3 complex upon the interaction with three benzoic acids in their voids. In addition, calculations at different levels (DFT, PM7, and MM3) for the 1:3 host&#8208;guest complex predict the formation of large stable columnar helical aggregates stabilized by the compact packing of the interstitial acids by &#960;&#8208;&#960; and CH&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions. The acids restrict the movement of the the star&#8208;shaped triazine cores along the stacking axis causing a template effect in the self&#8208;assembly of the complex. Theoretical predictions correlate with experimental results, since the interaction with achiral or chiral 3,4,5&#8208;(4&#8208;alkoxybenzyloxy)benzoic acids gives rise to supramolecular complexes that organize in bulk in hexagonal columnar mesophases stable at room temperature with intracolumnar order. The existence of supramolecular chirality in the mesophase was determined for complexes formed by acids derived from (  S  )&#8208;2&#8208;octanol. Chiral aggregation was also evidenced for complexes formed in dodecane.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Here we investigate&#160;the structural and biological effects ensuing form the disulfide bond replacement of a potent and selective C&#8208;X&#8208;C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) peptide antagonist, with 1,4&#8208; and 1,5&#8208; disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazole moieties. Both strategies produced candidates that showed high affinity and selectivity against CXCR4. Notably, when assessed for their ability to modulate the CXCL12&#8208;mediated cell migration, the 1,4&#8208;triazole variant conserved the antagonistic effect in the low&#8208;mid nanomolar range, while the 1,5&#8208;triazole one displayed the ability to activate the migration, becoming the first in class low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight CXCR4 peptide agonist. By combining NMR and computational studies, we provided a valuable model that highlighted differences in the interactions of the two peptidomimetics with the receptor that could account for their different functional profile. Finally, we envisage that our findings could be translated to different GPCR&#8208;interacting peptides for the pursuit of novel chemical probes that could assist in dissecting the complex puzzle of this fundamental class of transmembrane receptors.</dc:description>

      <title>A bis&#8208;chelating (O^N^O)/(N^N) ligand for the synthesis of heterobimetallic Pt(II)/Re(I) complexes: tools for the optimization of a new class of Pt(II) anticancer agents.</title>
      <dc:description>The two independent (O^N^O) and (N^N) coordination sites of a newly synthesized bis 2&#8208;(hydroxyphenyl)&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole platform have been exploited to prepare four monometallic neutral (O^N^O)Pt(II) complexes carrying DMSO, pyridine, triphenylphosphine or N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) as fourth ligand. Then the second (N^N) coordination site was used to introduce an IR&#8208;active rhenium tricarbonyl entity, affording the four corresponding heterobimetallic neutral Pt(II)/Re(I) complexes as well as a cationic Pt(II)/Re(I) derivative. X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies showed that distortion of the organic platform occurred to accommodate the coordination geometry of both metal centers. No ligand exchange and no transchelation occurred upon incubation of the Pt(II) complexes in aqueous environment or in the presence of Fe(III), respectively. The ligand and the complexes antiproliferative activity was first screened on the triple negative breast cancer cell line MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231.

      <title>The Coordination Chemistry of the N&#8208;Donor Substituted Phosphazanes Alex J. Plajer,a* Andrew D. Bond a and Dominic S. Wright a*</title>
      <dc:description>Phosph(III)azanes, featuring the heterocyclobutane P  2  N  2  ring, have now been established as building blocks in main group coordination and supramolecular compounds. Previous studies have largely involved their use as neutral P&#8208;donor ligands or as anionic N&#8208;donor ligands, derived from deprotonation of amido&#8208;phosphazanes [RNHP(&#956;&#8208;NR)]  2  . The use of neutral amido&#8208;phosphazanes themselves as chelating, H&#8208;bond donors in anion receptors has also been an area of recent interest because of the ease by which the proton acidity and anion binding constants can be modulated, by the incorporation of electron withdrawing  exo  &#8208; and  endo  &#8208;cyclic groups (R) and by the coordination of transition metals to the ring P atoms. We observed recently that the effect of P,N&#8208;chelation of metal atoms to the P atoms of  cis  &#8208;[(2&#8208;py)NHP(&#181;&#8208;N  t  Bu)]  2  (2&#8208;py = 2&#8208;pyridyl) not only pre&#8208;organises the N&#8208;H functionality for optimum H&#8208;bonding to anions but also results in a large increase in anion binding constants, well above those for traditional organic receptors like squaramides and ureas. Here we report a broader investigation of ligand chemistry of [(2&#8208;py)NHP(&#181;&#8208;  t  NBu)]  2  (2&#8208;py = 2&#8208;pyridyl) and of the new quinolyl derivative [(8&#8208;Qu)NHP(&#956;&#8208;N  t  Bu)]  2  (8&#8208;Qu = 8&#8208;quinolyl). The additional N&#8208;donor functionality of the heterocyclic substituents and its position has a marked effect on the anion and metal coordination chemistry of both species, leading to novel structural behaviour and reactivity compared to unfunctionalized counterparts.</dc:description>

Previous studies have largely involved their use as neutral P&#8208;donor ligands or as anionic N&#8208;donor ligands, derived from deprotonation of amido&#8208;phosphazanes [RNHP(&#956;&#8208;NR)]  2  . The use of neutral amido&#8208;phosphazanes themselves as chelating, H&#8208;bond donors in anion receptors has also been an area of recent interest because of the ease by which the proton acidity and anion binding constants can be modulated, by the incorporation of electron withdrawing  exo  &#8208; and  endo  &#8208;cyclic groups (R) and by the coordination of transition metals to the ring P atoms. We observed recently that the effect of P,N&#8208;chelation of metal atoms to the P atoms of  cis  &#8208;[(2&#8208;py)NHP(&#181;&#8208;N  t  Bu)]  2  (2&#8208;py = 2&#8208;pyridyl) not only pre&#8208;organises the N&#8208;H functionality for optimum H&#8208;bonding to anions but also results in a large increase in anion binding constants, well above those for traditional organic receptors like squaramides and ureas. Here we report a broader investigation of ligand chemistry of [(2&#8208;py)NHP(&#181;&#8208;  t  NBu)]  2  (2&#8208;py = 2&#8208;pyridyl) and of the new quinolyl derivative [(8&#8208;Qu)NHP(&#956;&#8208;N  t  Bu)]  2  (8&#8208;Qu = 8&#8208;quinolyl). The additional N&#8208;donor functionality of the heterocyclic substituents and its position has a marked effect on the anion and metal coordination chemistry of both species, leading to novel structural behaviour and reactivity compared to unfunctionalized counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>The Aggregation Regularity Effect of Multiarylpyrroles on Their Near&#8208;Infrared Aggregation&#8208;Enhanced Emission Property</title>
      <dc:description>Increasing the quantum yield of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emissive dyes is critical for biological applications because these fluorescent dyes generally show decreased emission efficiency under aqueous conditions. In this work, we designed and synthesized several multiarylpyrrole (MAP) derivatives, in which a furanylidene (FE) group at the 3&#8208;position of the pyrrole forms donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor molecules, MAP&#8208;FE, with a NIR emissive wavelength and aggregation&#8208;enhanced emission (AEE) features. Different alkyl chains of MAP&#8208;FEs linked to phenyl groups at the 2,5&#8208;position of the pyrrole ring resulted in different emissive wavelengths and quantum yields in aggregated states, such as powders or single crystals. Powder XRD data and single crystal analysis elucidated that the different lengths of alkyl chains had a significant impact on the regularity of MAP&#8208;FEs when they were forced to aggregate or precipitate, which affected the intermolecular interaction and the restriction degree of the rotating parts, which are essential components. Therefore, an increasing number of NIR dyes could be developed by this design strategy to produce efficient NIR dyes with AEE. Moreover, this method can provide general guidance for other related fields, such as organic solar cells and organic light&#8208;emitting materials, because they are all applied in the aggregated state.</dc:description>

      <title>Pseudocapacitive  Lithium Storage of Cauliflower&#8208;like CoFe2O4 for Low&#8208;Temperature Battery Operation</title>
      <dc:description>Binary transition metal oxides (BTMOs) with hierarchical micro&#8208;nano structures have attracted great interest as potential anode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Herein, we report the fabrication of hierarchical cauliflower&#8208;like CoFe2O4  (cl&#8208;CoFe2O4) via a facile room&#8208;temperature co&#8208;precipitation method followed by post&#8208;synthetic annealing. The obtained cauliflower structure is constructed by the assembly of microrods, which themselves are composed of small nanoparticles. Such hierarchical micro&#8208;nano structure can promote fast ion transport and stable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. As a result, the cl&#8208;CoFe2O4  can deliver high capacity (1019.9 mAh g&#8722;1  at 0.1 A g&#8722;1), excellent rate capability (626.0 mAh g&#8722;1  at 5 A g  &#8722;1), and good cyclability (675.4 mAh g&#8722;1  at 4 A g&#8722;1  for over 400 cycles) as an anode material for LIBs. Even at low temperatures of 0 &#176;C and &#8722;25 &#176;C, the cl&#8208;CoFe2O4  anode can deliver high capacities of 907.5 and 664.5 mAh g&#8722;1  at 100 mA g&#8722;1, respectively, indicating its wide operating temperature. More importantly, the full&#8208;cell assembled with a commercial LiFePO4  cathode exhibits a high rate performance (214.2 mAh g&#8722;1  at 5000 mA g&#8722;1) and an impressive cycling performance (612.7 mAh g&#8722;1  over 140 cycles at 300 mA g&#8722;1  ) in the voltage range of 0.5&#8208;3.6 V. Kinetic analysis reveals that the electrochemical performance of cl&#8208;CoFe2O4  is dominated by pseudocapacitive behavior, leading to fast Li  +  insertion/extraction and good cycling life.</dc:description>

      <title>Rapid discrimination of crystal handedness using XNCD mapping</title>
      <dc:description>We present a new method for determining the handedness of individual non&#8208;centrosymmetric crystals in a mixture using a tightly&#8208;focused, circularly polarized X&#8208;ray beam. The X&#8208;ray natural circular dichroism (XNCD) spectra measured at the metal K&#8208;edge on selected crystals of [&#916;&#8208;M(en)  3  ](NO  3  )  2  and [&#923;&#8208;M(en)  3  ](NO  3  )  2  (M = Co(II), Ni(II)) show extrema at the metal pre&#8208;edge (7712 eV for Co, 8335 eV for Ni). A mapping of a collection of some 220 crystals was then performed at the respective energies using left and right circular polarizations. The difference in absorption for the two polarizations, being either negative or positive, directly yielded the handedness of the crystal volume probed by the beam. Using this technique, it was found that the addition of L&#8208;ascorbic acid during the synthesis of [Co(en)  3  ](NO  3  )  2  resulted in an enantiomeric enrichment of the &#923;&#8208;isomer of 70&#177;12%, while the Ni analogue was similarly, but conversely, enriched in the &#916;&#8208;isomer (67&#177;21%).</dc:description>

      <title>A high Faraday efficiency NiMoO4 nanosheet arrays catalyst by adjusting the hydrophilicity for overall water splitting</title>
      <dc:description>To obtain a highly active, stable and bind&#8208;free electrode based on transition metal compound for water splitting, we have synthesized nickel foam&#8208;supported 3D NiMoO4 nanosheet arrays modified with 0D Fe&#8208;doped&#8208;carbon&#8208;quantum&#8208;dots (Fe&#8208;CQDs/NiMoO4/NF).

      <title>Photoinduced DNA Lesions in Dormant Bacteria. The Peculiar Route Leading to Spore Photoproduct Characterized by Multiscale Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <dc:description>Some bacterial species enter a dormant state in the form of spores to resist to unfavorable external conditions. Spores are resistant to a wide series of stress agents, including UV radiation, and can last for tens to hundreds of years. Due to the suspension of biological functions such as DNA repair, they accumulate DNA damage upon exposure to UV radiation. Differently from active organisms, the most common DNA photoproduct in spores are not cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, but rather the so&#8208;called spore photoproduct. This non&#8208;canonical photochemistry results from the dry state of DNA and the binding to small acid soluble proteins that drastically modify the structure and photoreactivity of the nucleic acid. In this contribution, we use multiscale molecular dynamics simulations including extended classical molecular dynamics and QM/MM biased dynamics to elucidate the coupling of electronic and structural factors leading to this photochemical outcome. In particular, we rationalize the well&#8208;described impact of the peculiar DNA environment found in spores on the favored formation of the spore photoproduct, given the small free energy barrier found for this path. Meanwhile, the specific organization of spore DNA precludes the photochemical path leading to cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers formation</dc:description>

      <title>Molecular Chirality in Classical Spacetime: Solving the Controversy about the Spinning Cone Model of Rotating Molecules</title>
      <dc:description>
Re&#8208;examining chirality: The disagreement between Barron and Mislow regarding the potential chirality of a spinning cone is settled. The controversy comes from an ambiguity in the spinning cone model and a new definition of chirality, which encompasses the one introduced by Lord Kelvin, is used to prove that both authors were right.







Abstract
The spinning cone is a model of rotating molecules used by Barron in 1986 in relation to asymmetric synthesis and to parity violation. He considered that the non&#8208;translating cone spinning about its symmetry axis has false chirality (i.e., it is not chiral), whereas Mislow concluded in 1999 that it is indeed chiral and severely criticized the true versus false chirality nomenclature introduced by Barron, who still disagreed in 2013 with the conclusion of Mislow. Here, it is shown that this controversy comes from an ambiguity in the spinning cone model and that in fact both authors were right. Light is thrown on the true chirality versus false chirality controversy with a very recently published result, which was thus unavailable to both authors: this is a new definition of chirality that encompasses the one introduced by Lord Kelvin at the end of the 19th century.

      <title>Oak&#8208;Associated Negativicute Equipped with Ancestral Aromatic Polyketide Synthase Produces Antimycobacterial Dendrubins</title>
      <dc:description>Anaerobic bacteria have only recently been recognized as a source of antibiotics; yet, the metabolic potential of Negativicutes (Gram&#8208;negative staining Firmicutes) such as the oak&#8208;associated Dendrosporobacter quercicolus has remained unknown. Genome mining of D. quercicolus and phylogenetic analyses revealed a gene cluster for a type II polyketide synthase (PKS) complex that belongs to the most ancestral enzyme systems of this type. Metabolic profiling, NMR analyses, and stable&#8208;isotope labeling led to the discovery of a new family of anthraquinone&#8208;type polyphenols, the dendrubins, which are diversified by acylation, methylation and dimerization. Dendrubin A and B were identified as strong antibiotics against a range of clinically relevant, human&#8208;pathogenic mycobacteria.</dc:description>

      <title>An&#160;&#945;2,3&#8208;sialyltransferase from&#160;Photobacterium phosphoreum&#160;with broad substrate scope: Controlling hydrolytic activity by directed evolution</title>
      <dc:description>Defined sialoglycoconjugates are important molecular probes to study the role of sialylated glycans in biological systems. We show that the&#160; &#945; 2,3&#8208;sialyltransferase from&#160;  Photobacterium phosphoreum&#160;  JT&#8208;ISH&#8208;467 (2,3SiaT  pph  ) tolerates a very broad substrate scope for modifications in the sialic acid part, including bulky amide variation, C5/C9 substitution and C5 stereoinversion. To reduce the enzyme&#8217;s hydrolytic activity that erodes the product yield, an extensive structure&#8208;guided mutagenesis study identified 3 variants that show up to 5 times higher catalytic efficiency for sialyltransfer, up to 10 times lower efficiency for substrate hydrolysis and drastically reduced product hydrolysis. Variant 2,3SiaT  pph  (A151D) displayed overall best performance in the synthesis of the GM3 trisaccharide ( &#945; 2,3&#8208;Neu5Ac&#8208;Lac) from lactose in a one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;enzyme cascade. Our study demonstrates that several complementary solutions can be found to suppress the common problem of undesired hydrolysis activity of microbial GT80 sialyltransferases. The new enzymes are powerful catalysts for the synthesis of a wide variety of complex natural and new&#8208;to&#8208;nature sialoconjugates for biological studies .</dc:description>

      <title>Temperature Induced Aggregation of Organic Semiconductors</title>
      <dc:description>One important feature of organic semiconductors is their solution processability, which allows researchers to tune their aggregation states in solution and solid states and to control the processing conditions to reach desirable electronic and optoelectronic properties. Temperature is one of the most important processing parameters of organic semiconductors and has been studied extensively particularly for those conjugated small&#8208; and macro&#8208; molecules with strong temperature&#8208;dependent aggregation properties. This review summarizes the temperature induced aggregation behaviors of organic semiconductors in solution, during solution casting and upon thermal annealing post&#8208;treatment of solid&#8208;state thin films. The influences of different aggregation states on the optoelectronic properties, in particular the photovoltaic properties, are discussed.

      <title>A porous mooncake&#8208;shaped Li4Ti5O12 anode material modified by SmF3 and its electrochemical performance in lithium&#8208;ion batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Reasonably designing and synthesizing advanced electrode materials is significant to enhance the electrochemical performance of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Herein, a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF, Mil&#8208;125) is used as a precursor and template to successfully synthesize the porous mooncake&#8208;shaped Li  4  Ti  5  O  12  (LTO) anode material assembled from nanoparticles. Even more critical, SmF  3  is used to modify the prepared porous mooncake&#8208;shaped LTO material. The SmF  3  modified LTO still maintains a porous mooncake&#8208;shaped structure with a large specific surface area, and the SmF  3  nanoparticles are observed to attach on the surface of the LTO material. It has been proved that the SmF  3  modification can further facilitate the transition from Ti  4+  to Ti  3+  , reduce the polarization of electrode, decrease charge transfer impedance (  R  ct  ) and solid electrolyte interface  impedance (  R  se  i  ), and increase the lithium&#8208;ions diffusion coefficient (  D  Li  ), thereby enhancing the electrochemical performance of LTO. Therefore, the porous mooncake&#8208;shaped LTO modified using 2  wt  % SmF  3  displays a large specific discharge capacity of 143.8 mAh g  &#8208;1  with an increment of 79.16% compared to pure LTO at a high rate of 10 C (1 C=170mAh g  &#8208;1  ), and shows a high retention rate of 96.4% after 500 cycles at 5 C&#8208;rate.</dc:description>

      <title>A Colorimetric Assay to Enable High&#8208;Throughput Identification of Biofilm Exopolysaccharide&#8208;Hydrolyzing Enzymes</title>

      <title>LGBTQ+ in STEM: Visibility and Beyond</title>
      <dc:description>
&#8220;Out and Proud&#8221; goes beyond slogans and efforts to make scientific workplaces more diverse and inclusive to LGBTQ+ scientists are being felt in Europe.







Abstract
Lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer (LGBTQ+, &#8220;+&#8221;=plus other sexes, gender identities, and sexual orientation) people in the STEM fields (STEM=science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) continue to experience discrimination in their workplace. In the last decade, the clamor for safe and diverse spaces continue to rise. Indeed, social media plays a huge part on increasing visibility of the LGBTQ+ community in STEM. LGBTQ+ scientists have not only promoted discourse and raised concerns to the online community, but more importantly, supported each other in platforms such as Twitter. Beyond social media, work at the institutes by LGBTQ+ individuals are also bearing fruit. This piece explores the grassroots work of scientists as they work hand&#8208;in&#8208;hand with their institute staff and leadership to promote diversity and inclusivity within and beyond their community.

      <title>Investigating Ugi / Passerini multicomponent reactions for the Site&#8208;Selective Conjugation of Native Trastuzumab</title>
      <dc:description>Site&#8208;selective modification of proteins has been the object of intense studies over the past decades, especially in the therapeutic field. Prominent results have been obtained with recombinant proteins, for which site&#8208;specific conjugation is made possible by the incorporation of particular amino acid residues or peptide sequences. In parallel, methods for the site&#8208;selective and site&#8208;specific conjugation of native and natural proteins are starting to thrive, allowing the controlled functionalization of various types of amino acid residues. Pursuing the efforts in this field, we planned to develop a new type of site&#8208;selective method, aiming at the simultaneous conjugation of two amino acid residues. We reasoned that this should give higher chances of developing a site&#8208;selective strategy compared to the large majority of existing methods that solely target a single residue. We opted for the Ugi four&#8208;center three&#8208;component reaction to implement this idea, with the aim of conjugating the side&#8208;chain amine and carboxylate groups of two neighbouring lysine and aspartate/glutamate. Herein, we show that this strategy can give access to valuable antibody conjugates bearing several different payloads, and limits the potential conjugation sites to only six on the model antibody trastuzumab.</dc:description>

      <title>An artificial hemoprotein with inducible peroxidase&#8208; and monooxygenase&#8208;like activities</title>
      <dc:description>A new inducible artificial metalloenzyme was obtained by covalent attachment of a Mn(III)&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin to the artificial bidomain repeat protein (A3A3&#8217;)Y26C. The biohybrid was characterized by MALDI&#8208;ToF MS, circular dichroism and UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopies. Its peroxidase activity was tested as well as its monooxygenase activity for the oxidation of thioanisole into sulfoxide by H  2  O  2  . Catalytic tests were performed on the original scaffold and with&#160; several co&#8208;catalysts a) additional imidazole, b) a specific &#945;Rep bA3&#8208;2 that induces the opening of the (A3A3&#8217;) interdomain region and c) a &#945;Rep bA3&#8208;2 bearing a His6&#8208;Tag (His6&#8208;bA3&#8208;2), and the best activity was obtained with His6&#8208;bA3&#8208;2. The mechanism was rationalized by a molecular modeling study including protein&#8208;ligand docking and large scale molecular dynamics. It appears that: 1) the hydrophobic Mn&#8208;porphyrin fits well into the (A3A3&#8217;)Y26C cavity, becomes protected by the protein and fully soluble in water; 2) the biohybrid alone does not display any catalytic activity, even in the presence of imidazole because of a closed conformation of the system; 3) opening of the binding site by bA3&#8208;2 leads to a noticeable activity and, 4) the best activity is obtained in the presence of the His6&#8208;Tag with one or two of the histidines able to coordinate to the metal acting as co&#8208;catalyst in the reactions. To the best of our knowledge, this constitutes the first example of an entirely artificial metalloenzyme with inducible peroxidase and monooxygenase activities, reminiscent of allosteric regulation of natural enzymatic pathways.</dc:description>

      <title>Ambident Reactivity of Imidazolium Cations as Evidence of the Dynamic Nature of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Mediated Organocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
Ambident nucleophilic reactivity of imidazolium cations at the C2 and C4 carbene centers indicated the dynamic nature of imidazolium&#8208;based organocatalysis proceeding by means of a covalent interaction of imidazolium carbenes with carbonyl substrates and was explained by the generation of the H&#8208;bonded ditopic carbanionic carbenes along with the classical C2 carbenes. Based on these findings, covalent bonding of imidazolium carbenes with carbonyl group of enolizable ketones was investigated. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K. Galkin, B. Karlinskii, V.&#8197;P. Ananikov, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.201905704).

     alt="Ambident Reactivity of Imidazolium Cations as Evidence of the Dynamic Nature of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Mediated Organocatalysis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ambident nucleophilic reactivity &lt;/b&gt; of imidazolium cations at the C2 and C4 carbene centers indicated the dynamic nature of imidazolium&#8208;based organocatalysis proceeding by means of a covalent interaction of imidazolium carbenes with carbonyl substrates and was explained by the generation of the H&#8208;bonded ditopic carbanionic carbenes along with the classical C2 carbenes. Based on these findings, covalent bonding of imidazolium carbenes with carbonyl group of enolizable ketones was investigated. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K. Galkin, B.

      <title>Female Faculty: Why So Few and Why Care?</title>
      <dc:description>
Diversity in academia: Data shows that there are few female faculty in academia today, with the percentage decreasing the higher the rank. There are many common responses to gender equality efforts that hamper progress of women in academia. Herein, we counteract such comments and discuss possible solutions along with concerns about how the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic may affect diversity in academia.







Abstract
Despite slow ongoing progress in increasing the representation of women in academia, women remain significantly under&#8208;represented at senior levels, in particular in the natural sciences and engineering. Not infrequently, this is downplayed by bringing forth arguments such as inherent biological differences between genders, that current policies are adequate to address the issue, or by deflecting this as being &#8220;not my problem&#8221; among other examples. In this piece we present scientific evidence that counters these claims, as well as a best&#8208;practice example, Genie, from Chalmers University of Technology, where one of the authors is currently employed. We also highlight particular challenges caused by the current COVID&#8208;19 pandemic. Finally, we conclude by proposing some possible solutions to the situation and emphasize that we need to all do our part, to ensure that the next generation of academics experience a more diverse, inclusive, and equitable working environment.

      <title>Synthesis, Structure, Reactivity and Catalytic Implications of a Cationic, Acetylide&#8208;Bridged Trigold&#8211;JohnPhos Species</title>
      <dc:description>
Multinuclear gold: A new family of tri&#8208;AuI complexes have been characterised as intermediates during the [AuIL][SbF6] catalytic preparation of acetaldehyde acetals. These well&#8208;characterised cationic AuI intermediates lend support to the proposed reaction mechanism. An analogous copper complex revealed different behaviour, leading to a vinylphosphonium and copper nanoparticles.







Abstract
The cationic complex [(JohnPhos&#8211;Au)3(acetylide)][SbF6] (JohnPhos=(2&#8208;biphenyl)di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphine, L1) has been characterised structurally and features an acetylide&#8211;trigold(I)&#8211;JohnPhos system; the trinuclear&#8211;acetylide unit, coordinated to the monodentate bulk phosphines, adopts an unprecedented &#956;,&#951;1,&#951;2,&#951;1 coordination mode with an additional interaction between distal phenyl rings and gold centres. Other cationic &#963;,&#960;&#8208;[(gold(I)L1)2] complexes have also been isolated. The reaction of trimethylsilylacetylene with various alcohols (iPrOH, nBuOH, n&#8208;HexOH) catalysed by cationic [AuIL1][SbF6] complexes in CH2Cl2 at 50&#8201;&#176;C led to the formation of acetaldehyde acetals with a high degree of chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity. The reaction mechanism was studied, and several organic and inorganic intermediates have been characterised. A comparative study with the analogous cationic [CuIL1][PF6] complex revealed different behaviour; the copper metal is lost from the coordination sphere leading to the formation of cationic vinylphosphonium and copper nanoparticles. Additionally, a new catalytic approach for the formation of this high&#8208;value cationic vinylphosphonium has been established.

      <title>Activity&#8208;Based Sensing of Ascorbate by Using Copper&#8208;Mediated Oxidative Bond Cleavage</title>
      <dc:description>
Probing ascorbate: A new, activity&#8208;based sensing strategy was developed for the highly selective detection of ascorbate. A copper(II) complex was designed to be activated by ascorbate to effect an oxidative bond cleavage and release an emissive fluorophore for a turn&#8208;on signal. The new ascorbate probes can be applied in complex matrix including food, plasma, and live cells.







Abstract
Ascorbate is an important biological reductant and enzyme cofactor. Although direct detection through ascorbate&#8208;mediated reduction is possible, this approach suffers from poor selectivity due to the wide range of cellular reducing agents. To overcome this limitation, we leverage reduction potential of ascorbate to mediate a copper&#8208;mediated oxidative bond cleavage of ether&#8208;caged fluorophores. The copper(II) complexes supported by a {bis(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)}benzylamine or a {bis(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)}(2&#8208;methoxybenzyl)amine ligand were identified as an ascorbate responsive unit and their reaction with ascorbate yields a copper&#8208;based oxidant that enables rapid benzylic oxidation and the release of an ether&#8208;caged dye (coumarin or fluorescein). The copper&#8208;mediated bond cleavage is specific to ascorbate and the trigger can be readily derivatized for tuning photophysical properties of the probes. The probes were successfully applied for the fluorometric detection of ascorbate in commercial food samples, human plasma, and serum, and within live cells by using confocal microscopy and flow cytometry.

      <title>Engineering Bifunctional Host Materials of Sulfur and Lithium&#8208;Metal Based on Nitrogen&#8208;Enriched Polyacrylonitrile for Li&#8211;S Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) is delicately engineered as a bifunctional host material to simultaneously solve the problems of the shuttle effect in the cathode and lithium dendrite in the anode, which leads to improved electrochemical performances of both electrodes. Due to excellent bifunctional host characteristics, the full cell demonstrates an outstanding long&#8208;term cycling capability.







Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs) still suffer from the shuttle effect on the cathode and the lithium dendrite on the anode. Herein, polyacrylonitrile (PAN) is developed into a bifunctional host material to simultaneously address the challenges faced on both the sulfur cathode and lithium anode in LSBs. For the sulfur cathode, PAN is bonded with sulfur to produce sulfurized PAN (SPAN) to avoid the shuttle effect. The SPAN is accommodated into a conductive 3D CNTs&#8208;wrapped carbon foam to prepare a self&#8208;supporting cathode, which improves the electronic and ionic conductivity, and buffers the volume expansion. Thereby, it delivers reversible capacity, superb rate capability, and outstanding cycling stability. For the Li&#8208;metal anode, PAN aerogel is carbonized to give macroporous N&#8208;doped cross&#8208;linked carbon nanofiber that behaves as a lithiophilic host to regulate Li plating and suppress the growth of Li dendrite. Combining the improvements for both the cathode and anode realizes a remarkable long&#8208;term cyclability (765&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 300&#8197;cycles) in a full cell. It provides new opportunity to propel the practical application of advanced LSBs.

      <dc:description>
New topology of polyoxovanadates: A rare example of lacunary Keggin&#8208;type vanadoselenite [SeV10O28(SeO3)3]8&#8722; ({Se4V10}) was readily obtained, which shows sufficient reactivity with divalent transition metals (TMs) to form a new series of TM&#8208;sandwiched complexes {(Se4V10)2M} (M=Mn, Co, Zn). Such new TM&#8208;derivatives can efficiently catalysis heterogeneous oxidation of sulfides in high conversion and selectivity under mild conditions.
