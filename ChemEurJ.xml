         <title>Yolk&#8208;shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C nanocomposites as a heterogeneous Fenton&#8208;like catalyst for organic dye removal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The yolk&#8208;shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C nanocomposites with Co3O4 as the core, Fe3O4/C as the shell, and a cavity structure were synthesized by the hard template method. The physical and chemical properties of the composites were characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD, TGA, XPS, BET, and VSM. The specific surface area of yolk&#8208;shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C nanocomposites is 175.9 m2 g&#8208;1, showing superparamagnetic properties. The yolk&#8208;shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C nanocomposites were used as heterogeneous Fenton catalysts to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to degrade MB, which showed high catalytic degradation performance. The degradation rate of MB reached 100% within 30 min under the circumstances of the yolk&#8208;shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C nanocomposites dosage of 0.1 g L&#8208;1, the PMS dosage of 1.0 g L&#8208;1, the initial MB concentration of 100 mg L&#8208;1, an initial pH of 5.5, and a temperature of 30&#177;2 &#8451;. The enhanced catalytic performance of the yolk&#8208;shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C nanocomposites can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the two catalytically active materials and the middle cavity. The effects of different operating parameters and co&#8208;existing anion species on MB degradation were also investigated. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis and quenching experiments confirmed that the formation of SO&#8324;&#775;&#8315;&#160;in the&#160;yolk&#8208;shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C/PMS system contributes to MB degradation. In addition, yolk&#8208;shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C nanocomposites can be easily separated from the pollutant solution under the action of an external magnetic field, and the degradation rate of MB can still reach 98% after five cycles, indicating that it has good stability and reusability and has broad application prospects in the field of water purification.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoselective methionine labelling of recombinant Trastuzumab shows high in vitro and in vivo tumour targeting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly effective 2&#8208;step system for site&#8208;specific antibody modification and conjugation of the monoclonal antibody Herceptin (commercially available under Trastuzumab) in a cysteine&#8208;independent manner was used to generate labelled antibodies for in vivo imaging. The first step contains redox&#8208;activated chemical tagging (ReACT) of thioethers via engineered methionine residues to introduce specific alkyne moieties, thereby offering a novel easy way to fundamentally change the process of antibody bioconjugation. The second step involves modification of the introduced alkyne via azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition 'click' conjugation. The versatility of this 2&#8208;step approach is demonstrated here by the selective incorporation of a fluorescent dye but can also be applied to a wide variety of different conjugation partners depending on the desired application in a facile manner. Methionine&#8208;modified antibodies were characterised in vitro, and the diagnostic potential of the most promising variant was further analysed in an in vivo xenograft animal model using a fluorescence imaging modality. This study demonstrates how methionine&#8208;mediated antibody conjugation offers an orthogonal and versatile route to the generation of tailored antibody conjugates with in vivo applicability.</dc:description>

         <title>MOF&#8208;derived NiCo&#8208;LDH nanocages on CuO nanorod arrays for robust and high energy density asymmetric supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Layered double hydroxide (LDH) is widely explored in supercapacitors on account of its high capacity, adjustable composition and easy synthesis process. Unfortunately, solitary LDH still has great limitations as electrode material due to the shortcomings such as poor conductivity and easy agglomeration. Herein, nanoflakes assembled NiCo&#8208;LDH hollow nanocages derived from metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) precursor are strung by CuO nanorods formed from etching and oxidation of copper foam (CF), forming hierarchical CuO@NiCo&#8208;LDH heterostructures. The as&#8208;synthesized CuO@NiCo&#8208;LDH/CF shows large capacitance (5607 mF cm&#8208;2 at 1 mA cm&#8208;2), superior rate performance (88.3% retention at 10 mA cm&#8211;2) and impressive cycling durability (93.1% capacitance is retained after 5000 cycles), which is significant superior to control CuO/CF, CuO@ZIF&#8208;67/CF, NiCo&#8208;LDH/CF and Cu(OH)2@NiCo&#8208;LDH/CF electrodes. Besides, an asymmetrical supercapacitor consists of CuO@NiCo&#8208;LDH/CF and activated carbon displays maximum energy density of 47.3 Wh kg&#8208;1, and its capacitance only declines by 6.8% after 10000 cycles, demonstrating remarkable cycling durability. The advantages of highly conductive and robust CuO nanorods, MOF&#8208;derived hollow structure and the core&#8208;shell heterostructure contribute to the outstanding electrochemical performance. This synthesis strategy can be extended to design of various core&#8208;shell heterostructures adopted in versatile electrochemical energy storage applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimization of G&#8208;Quadruplex Ligands through a SAR Study Combining Parallel Synthesis and Screening of Cationic Bis(acylhydrazones)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ready to screen. A library of cationic bis(acylhydrazones) as putative G4&#8208;DNA ligands was prepared by a straightforward condensation of the corresponding building blocks. Screening the resulting samples (without any isolation or purification steps) by fluorescence&#8208;melting experiments identified three novel hits, whose interactions with G4&#8208;DNA targets were studied in detail by several biophysical methods and molecular modeling.







Abstract
G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s), secondary structures adopted by guanine&#8208;rich DNA and RNA sequences, are implicated in numerous biological processes and have been suggested as potential drug targets. Accordingly, there is an increasing interest in developing high&#8208;throughput methods that allow the generation of congeneric series of G4&#8208;targeting molecules (&#8220;ligands&#8221;) and investigating their interactions with the targets. We have developed an operationally simple method of parallel synthesis to generate &#8220;ready&#8208;to&#8208;screen&#8221; libraries of cationic acylhydrazones, a motif that we have previously identified as a promising scaffold for potent, biologically active G4 ligands. Combined with well&#8208;established screening techniques, such as fluorescence melting, this method enables the rapid synthesis and screening of combinatorial libraries of potential G4 ligands. Following this protocol, we synthesized a combinatorial library of 90 bis(acylhydrazones) and screened it against five different nucleic acid structures. This way, we were able to analyze the structure&#8211;activity relationships within this series of G4 ligands, and identified three novel promising ligands whose interactions with G4&#8208;DNAs of different topologies were studied in detail by a combination of several biophysical techniques, including native mass spectrometry, and molecular modeling.

         <title>Aluminium&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Hydroboration of Esters and Epoxides to Alcohols: C&#8722;O Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The CBG aluminium&#8208;dihydride (I) is used as a catalyst for reducing esters with good tolerance of reducible functionalities. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that compound I catalyzed the hydroboration of epoxides into Markovnikov&#8208;branched products. The earth&#8208;abundant, non&#8208;toxic, and inexpensive Al&#8208;based catalysts are attractive and alternatives to expensive transition and lanthanide&#8208;based metal catalysts.







Abstract
In this work, the molecular aluminium dihydride complex bearing an N, N&#8217;&#8208;chelated conjugated bis&#8208;guanidinate (CBG) ligand is used as a catalyst for reducing a wide range of aryl and alkyl esters with good tolerance of alkene (C=C), alkyne (C&#8801;C), halides (Cl, Br, I and F), nitrile (C&#8801;N), and nitro (NO2) functionalities. Further, we investigated the catalytic application of aluminium dihydride in the C&#8722;O bond cleavage of alkyl and aryl epoxides into corresponding branched Markovnikov ring&#8208;opening products. In addition, the chemoselective intermolecular reduction of esters over other reducible functional groups, such as amides and alkenes, has been established. Intermediates are isolated and characterized by NMR and HRMS studies, which confirm the probable catalytic cycles for the hydroboration of esters and epoxides.

         <title>Hyperbranched Diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based Polymers Constructed via Linear Side&#8208;Chains towards Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conjugated polymers with high charge mobilities have drawn increasing attention in organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) in recent years. However, OFETs of conjugated polymers with high mobility and good device stability remain a challenge. In this article, we report a hyperbranched polymer approach to improve the charge mobility and device stability. Three hyperbranched diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based polymers were designed and synthesized via linear alkyl side&#8208;chain linkers. The results show that 2D topological hyperbranched polymers form stable thin film microstructures, and thus improve the device stability, since the conjugated moiety is interconnected by linear alkyl chain. Besides, the incorporation of linear alkyl chain instead of branching alkyl one reduce steric hindrance, and improve the microstructure ordering as well as the charge mobility. Bar&#8208;coated OFETs result demonstrates that the devices mobilities and operational stabilities (bias stability and bending resistance) are both improved. All these indicate that hyperbranched polymer is a potential candidate for future application.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report herein the palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclizative borylation of allenyl ketones with diboron compounds which involves the carbene boryl migratory insertion as the key step. This reaction features mild conditions, good functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope. Thus, it represents an efficient methodology for the assembly of diverse tri&#8208;substituted furyl boronates. In addition, a series of transformations of the resulting multi&#8208;substituted furyl boronates were conducted to provide various densely substituted furan derivatives in good yields, further illustrating the potential synthetic utility of this methodology.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyanion&#8208;type Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7) (NFPP) is a promising cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries due to its low cost and high safety. Herein, a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) holey graphene (HG) decorated NFPP/C material (NFPPCHG) has been successfully prepared by a simple and scalable ball milling strategy with sodium phytate and ferrous oxalate as precursors. The introduction of HG can obviously improve the specific surface area, electronic conductivity and ions transport performance of NFPPCHG, and largely enhance its electrochemical properties. The prepared NFPPCHG delivers a high reversible capacity of 118 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.2 C and keeps a considerable capacity of 53 mAh g&#8208;1 even at an ultrahigh rate of 100 C. NFPPCHG also shows excellent performance at 55 &#176;C and &#8208;20 &#176;C. Moreover, in&#8208;situ distribution of relaxation time analysis further demonstrates NFPPCHG has superior electrochemical kinetics. In addition, HC//NFPPCHG full cell displays good performance, suggesting great potential of the prepared material for practical applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Opening the ring of cyclic amines by regioselective fisson of one of the carbon&#8211;nitrogen bonds greatly expands the repertoire of available nitrogen&#8208;containing skeletons. Unlike approaches starting from cyclic tertiary amines, methods that can directly open secondary amines are still scarce. The present work discloses an efficient reductive ring opening of either of these cyclic amines using PhSiH3 under B(C6F5)3 catalysis. By this, the direct transformation of unstrained cyclic amines into the corresponding acyclic amines is achieved in a simple one&#8208;pot operation. A stepwise mechanism proceeding through the intermediacy of silylammonium ions followed by reductive cleavage of a carbon&#8211;nitrogen bond was experimentally verified.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Isomeric Tb3+&#8211;Phthalocyanine Double&#8211;Decker Complexes Depending on the Difference in the Direction of Coordination Plane and Their Magnetic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A C4 h  symmetric swastika phthalocyanine, 1,8,15,22&#8208;tertrakis(2,4&#8208;dimethylpent&#8208;3&#8208;oxy)phthalocyanine (H2TdMPPc), was employed to synthesize Tb3+&#8208;phthalocyanine double&#8208;decker complexes ([Tb(TdMPPc)2]s). Because H2TdMPPc has C4 h  symmetry, (S, S), (R, R), and meso isomers of [Tb(TdMPPc)2] were obtained depending on the difference in the direction of the coordination plane of two C4 h &#8208;type phthalocyanines with respect to a central Tb3+ ion. We investigated the physical properties of these [Tb(TdMPPc)2] isomers, including their single&#8208;ion magnetic properties, and found that the spin&#8208;reversal energy barrier (Ueff) of the meso isomer was apparently higher than that of the enantiomer. Detailed crystal structural analyses indicated that the meso isomer has a more symmetrical structure than do the enantiomers, thereby suggesting that the higher Ueff of the meso isomer originated from the higher symmetrical structure.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of the Redox Non&#8208;Innocent Hydroxyl Ligand in the Activation of O2 Performed by [Ni(H)(OH)]+</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cationic complex [Ni(H)(OH)]+ was previously found to activate dioxygen and methane in gas phase under single collision conditions. These remarkable reactivities were thought to originate from a non&#8208;classical electronic structure, where the Ni&#8208;centre adopts a Ni(II), instead of the classically expected Ni(III) oxidation state by formally accepting an electron from the hydroxo ligand, which formally becomes a hydroxyl radical in the process. Such radicaloid oxygen moieties are envisioned to easily react with otherwise inert substrates, mimicking familiar reactivities of free radicals. In this study, the reductive activation of dioxygen by [Ni(H)(OH)]+ to afford the hydroperoxo species was investigated using coupled cluster, multireference ab initio and density functional theory calculations. Orbital and wave function analyses indicate that O2 binding tranforms the aforementioned non&#8208;classical electronic structure to a classical Ni(III)&#8208;hydroxyl system, before O2 reduction takes place. Remarkably, we found no evidence for a direct involvement of the radicaloid hydroxyl in the reaction with O2, as is often assumed. The function of the redox non&#8208;innocent character of the activator complex is to protect the reactive electronic structure until the complex engages O2, upon which a dramatic electronic reorganization releases internal energy and drives the chemical reaction to completion.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The cationic complex [Ni(H)(OH)]+ was previously found to activate dioxygen and methane in gas phase under single collision conditions. These remarkable reactivities were thought to originate from a non-classical electronic structure, where the Ni-centre adopts a Ni(II), instead of the classically expected Ni(III) oxidation state by formally accepting an electron from the hydroxo ligand, which formally becomes a hydroxyl radical in the process. Such radicaloid oxygen moieties are envisioned to easily react with otherwise inert substrates, mimicking familiar reactivities of free radicals. In this study, the reductive activation of dioxygen by [Ni(H)(OH)]+ to afford the hydroperoxo species was investigated using coupled cluster, multireference ab initio and density functional theory calculations. Orbital and wave function analyses indicate that O2 binding tranforms the aforementioned non-classical electronic structure to a classical Ni(III)-hydroxyl system, before O2 reduction takes place. Remarkably, we found no evidence for a direct involvement of the radicaloid hydroxyl in the reaction with O2, as is often assumed. The function of the redox non-innocent character of the activator complex is to protect the reactive electronic structure until the complex engages O2, upon which a dramatic electronic reorganization releases internal energy and drives the chemical reaction to completion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Distance&#8208;Triggered Distinct Aryl Migrations on Azidodiboranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Derived from structurally similar precursors, two different azidodiboranes went through distinct aryl migration reactions triggered by different boron&#8208;boron separation distances. Biphenylene based diborane with a shorter boron&#8208;boron distance underwent heterolateral aryl migration to form a seven&#8208;membered azadiborepin, while xanthrene based diborane with a longer boron&#8208;boron distance afforded a stable bis&#8208;azidoborane scaffold. The pyrolysis of such a bis&#8208;azidoborane led to eight&#8208;membered oxazadiborocine through homolateral aryl migration and subsequent [3+2] cycloaddition. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations unveiled that the boron&#8208;boron separation distances were the intrinsic factors for the distinct migrations.</dc:description>

         <title>Buried Interface Regulation by Bio&#8208;Functional Molecules for Efficient and Stable Planar Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Among the factors that lead to the reduction of the efficiency of perovskite solar cell (PSCs), is the difficulty involved in realizing a high&#8208;quality film and the efficient charge transfer that take place at the interface between electron&#8208;transport layer (ETL) and perovskite. Here, we demonstrated a strategy for planar&#8208;type devices by natural bio&#8208;functional interfaces that uses a buried electron&#8208;transport layer made of cobalamin complexed tin oxide (SnO2@B12). As systematically investigating the effects of SnO2@B12 interfacial layer in perovskite solar cells, cobalamin can chemically link SnO2 layer and perovskite layer, resulting in improved perovskite film quality and interfacial defect passivation. Utilizing SnO2@B12 improves the efficiency of planar&#8208;type PSCs by 20.60 %. Furthermore, after 250 hours of exposure to an ambient atmosphere, unsealed PSCs containing SnO2@B12 degrade by 10%. This research provides a viable method for developing bio&#8208;functional molecules that will increase the effectiveness and durability of planar&#8208;perovskite solar cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Post&#8208;Functionalization and Properties of Diphosphapentaarenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shortening the core. Diphosphapentaarenes, the shorter analogs of diphosphahexaarenes, are stable linearly fused systems containing two six&#8208;membered phosphorus heterocycles. They are fluorescent and their phosphorus atoms can be readily post&#8208;functionalized to modify their optoelectronic properties.







Abstract
Linearly&#8208;fused polyarenes are an important class of compounds with high relevance in materials science. While modifying the shape and size represents a common means to fine&#8208;tune their properties, the precise placement of heteroatoms is a strategy that is receiving an increasing deal of attention to overcome the intrinsic limitations of all&#8208;carbon structures. Thus, linearly&#8208;fused diphosphaarenes recently emerged as a novel family of molecules with striking optoelectronic properties and outstanding stability. However, the properties of diphosphaarenes are far from being benchmarked. Herein, we report the synthesis, phosphorus post&#8208;functionalization and properties of new diphosphapentaarene derivatives. We describe their synthetic limitations and unveil their potential for optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Highly Cytotoxic Molybdenocenes with Strong Metabolic Effects Inhibit Tumour Growth in Mice</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of molybdenocenes containing lipophilic substituted Cp ligands as well as bioactive chelating ligands have shown cytotoxicity against lung, colon and ovarian cancer in&#8197;vitro; one complex showed the greatest anticancer activity of any Mo&#8208;based agent known to date. Significant tumour growth inhibition was observed in in&#8197;vivo studies while proteomics showed the most active compound had a strong effect on cellular metabolic processes.







Abstract
A series of six highly lipophilic Cp&#8208;substituted molybdenocenes bearing different bioactive chelating ligands was synthesized and characterized by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and X&#8208;ray crystallography. In vitro experiments showed a greatly increased cytotoxic potency when compared to the non&#8208;Cp&#8208;substituted counterparts. In vivo experiments performed with the dichlorido precursor, (Ph2C&#8722;Cp)2MoCl2 and the in&#8197;vitro most active complex, containing the thioflavone ligand, showed an inhibition of tumour growth. Proteomic studies on the same two compounds demonstrated a significant regulation of tubulin&#8208;associated and mitochondrial inner membrane proteins for both compounds and a strong metabolic effect of the thioflavone containing complex.

         <title>The HD Reaction of Nitrogenase: a Detailed Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detailed mechanism is presented for the reaction D +2H++2e&#8722;&#8594;2HD of the enzyme nitrogenase, developed with density functional simulations of a 486&#8208;atom model of the active site FeMo&#8208;co and surrounding protein. It explains the accumulated experimental data and connects with the enigmatic N2&#8594;NH3 reaction of the enzyme.







Abstract
Nitrogenase is the enzyme that converts N2 to NH3 under ambient conditions. The chemical mechanism of this catalysis at the active site FeMo&#8208;co [Fe7S9CMo(homocitrate)] is unknown. An obligatory co&#8208;product is H2, while exogenous H2 is a competitive inhibitor. Isotopic substitution using exogenous D2 revealed the N2&#8208;dependent reaction D2+2H++2e&#8722;&#8594;2HD (the &#8216;HD reaction&#8217;), together with a collection of additional experimental characteristics and requirements. This paper describes a detailed mechanism for the HD reaction, developed and elaborated using density functional simulations with a 486&#8208;atom model of the active site and surrounding protein. First D2 binds at one Fe atom (endo&#8208;Fe6 coordination position), where it is flanked by H&#8722;Fe6 (exo position) and H&#8722;Fe2 (endo position). Then there is synchronous transfer of these two H atoms to bound D2, forming one HD bound to Fe2 and a second HD bound to Fe6. These two HD dissociate sequentially. The final phase is recovery of the two flanking H atoms. These H atoms are generated, sequentially, by translocation of a proton from the protein surface to S3B of FeMo&#8208;co and combination with introduced electrons. The first H atom migrates from S3B to exo&#8208;Fe6 and the second from S3B to endo&#8208;Fe2. Reaction energies and kinetic barriers are reported for all steps. This mechanism accounts for the experimental data: (a)&#8197;stoichiometry; (b)&#8197;the N2&#8208;dependence results from promotional N2 bound at exo&#8208;Fe2; (c)&#8197;different N2 binding Km for the HD reaction and the NH3 formation reaction results from involvement of two different sites; (d)&#8197;inhibition by CO; (e)&#8197;the non&#8208;occurrence of 2HD&#8594;H2+D2 results from the synchronicity of the two transfers of H to D2; (f)&#8197;inhibition of HD production at high pN2 is by competitive binding of N2 at endo&#8208;Fe6; (g)&#8197;the non&#8208;leakage of D to solvent follows from the hydrophobic environment and irreversibility of proton introduction.

         <title>Lysosomal Targeting of &#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin</title>

Cyclodextrins. Attachment of a bis&#8208;mannose&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate terminated glycan to &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin increases both cellular internalisation and transport to the lysosome, indicating potential application for improved treatments for lysosomal metabolite accumulation







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD) and derivatives are approved therapeutics in &gt;30 clinical settings. &#946;&#8208;CDs have also shown promise as therapeutics for treatment of some lysosomal storage disorders, such as Niemann&#8208;Pick disease type C, and other disease states which involve metabolite accumulation in the lysosome. In these cases, &#946;&#8208;CD activity relies on transport to the lysosome, wherein it can bind hydrophobic substrate and effect extraction. The post&#8208;translational attachment of N&#8208;glycans terminated in mannose&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate (M6P) residues is the predominant method by which lysosomal enzymes are targeted to the lysosome. In this work we covalently attach a synthetic biantennary bis&#8208;M6P&#8208;terminated N&#8208;glycan to &#946;&#8208;CD and study the effect of the added glycans in a mammalian cell line. The formation of a host guest complex with a Cy5 fluorophore allows study of both cellular internalisation and transport to the lysosome by fluorescence microscopy. Results indicate that the rates of both internalisation and lysosomal transport are increased by the attachment of M6P&#8208;glycans to &#946;&#8208;CD, indicating that M6P&#8208;glycan conjugation may improve the therapeutic effectiveness of &#946;&#8208;CD for the treatment of disorders involving hydrophobic metabolite accumulation in the lysosome.

         <title>Advanced Covalent Organic Frameworks for Multi&#8208;Valent Metal Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer an opportunity for complex structural design and specific functional development, facilitating, for example, the applications of multi&#8208;valent metal ion batteries (Zn2+, Mg2+, Al3+). This comprehensive review describes COF synthesis and applications, provides advances in topology design and synthetic reactions, surveys the application of COFs in multi&#8208;valent ion batteries, discusses the key issues of COF electrodes, and predicts future applications.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have received increased interest in recent years as an advanced class of materials. By virtue of the available monomers, multiple conformations and various linkages, COFs offer a wide range of opportunities for complex structural design and specific functional development of materials, which has facilitated the widespread application in many fields, including multi&#8208;valent metal ion batteries (MVMIBs), described as the attractive candidate replacing lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). With their robust skeletons, diverse pores, flexible structures and abundant functional groups, COFs are expected to help realize a high performance MVMIBs. In this review, we present an overview of COFs, describe advances in topology design and synthetic reactions, and study the application of COFs in MVMIBs, as well as discuss challenges and solutions in the preparation of COFs electrodes, in the hope of providing constructive insights into the future direction of COFs.

         <title>Water&#8208;Triggered Chemical Transformation of Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8208;triggered interfacial chemistry shows promising advantage for morphology, shape and composition control towards formation of new bio&#8208;compatible perovskite nanocrystals. In this Review, the recent development of this unique approach at the water&#8211;hexane interface that may be extended to tailor not only CsPbX3 but also perovskite nanocrystals beyond this family is summarized.







Abstract
Recently emerged lead&#8208;halide perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) are promising optoelectronic material due to their easy solution processability, wide range of color tunability, as well as very high photoluminescence quantum yield. Despite their significant success in lab&#8208;scale optoelectronic applications, the long&#8208;term stability becomes the main issue, hindering them towards commercialization. The highly ionic nature of such lead&#8208;halide structure makes them extremely unstable in water and air. But a very few groups have taken the advantage of such nature of the crystal structure for water&#8208;triggered chemical transformation towards shape, composition, and morphology controlled stable and bright PNCs, which are otherwise difficult to obtain by typical direct approach. Furthermore, using polymer as an encapsulating layer for the PNCs, water&#8208;soluble stable PNCs have been prepared. In this review, the recent progress on the water&#8211;hexane interface chemistry towards chemical transformation to produce several PNCs is described. Such method not only ensure to yield several shape&#8208;controlled perovskites nanocrystals, but also formation of perovskites in aqueous phase that show promising application towards bio&#8208;imaging.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Luminescent Materials with Multiple Emission Colors and Near&#8208;Unity Quantum Yield</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward heat&#8208;treatment strategy is proposed to load 3,4,9,10&#8208;perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride into the matrix of boric acid to produce powders with a near&#8208;unity quantum yield and tunable emission color from yellow to green. The confinement effect of boric acid is responsible for the high emission efficiency of products.







Abstract
Developing solid luminescent materials with a unity quantum yield and tunable emission color is promising, although it is still a difficult task. A straightforward heat&#8208;treatment method has been developed to load 3,4,9,10&#8208;perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) into the matrix of boric acid (BA) to produce powders with a near&#8208;unity quantum yield and tunable emission color from yellow to green. Our results suggest that the emission of the powders originates from PTCDA, and the tunability of the emission color is caused by the hydrolysis of PTCDA in the alkaline environment. The near&#8208;unity quantum yield is attributed to the BA matrix, which confines PTCDA. In addition, the powder also shows excellent thermal stability that allows its application in light&#8208;emitting diodes. The above results are important for the development of solid&#8208;state luminescent materials for various applications, and also provide a clue for studying the emission properties of luminescent materials.

         <title>Coordination of Pnictogenylboranes Towards Tl(I) Salts and a Tl&#8208; Mediated P&#8722;P Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions of NMe3&#8208;stabilized pnictogenylboranes with Tl(I) salts of weakly coordinating anions led to rare examples of Tl coordination compounds [Tl(EH2BH2&#8901;NMe3)n]+ (n=1, 3; E=P, As) featuring mono and threefold coordination of pnictogenylboranes. In addition, by using CH2Cl2 as a solvent, an unprecedented, Tl&#8208;promoted P&#8722;P coupling was observed, leading to [Me3N&#8901;BH2PH2&#8208;PHBH2&#8901;NMe3]+. During these investigations, novel Tl[WCA] salts were prepared and the synthesis of EH2BH2&#8901;NMe3 was improved towards greater accessibility.







Abstract
The coordination chemistry of only Lewis&#8208;base (LB)&#8208;stabilized pnictogenylboranes EH2BH2&#8901;NMe3 (E=P, As) towards Tl(I) salts has been studied. The reaction of Tl[BArCl] (BArCl=[B(3,5&#8208;C6H3Cl2)4]&#8722;) with the corresponding pnictogenylborane results in the formation of [Tl(EH2BH2&#8901;NMe3)][BArCl] (1&#8201;a: E=P; 1&#8201;b: E=As). Whereas the Tl ion in 1&#8201;a/b is monocoordinated, the exchange of the weakly coordinating anion (WCA) in the Tl(I) salt leads to the formation of a trigonal pyramidal coordination mode at the Tl atom by coordination of three equivalents of EH2BH2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;NMe3 in [Tl(EH2BH2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;NMe3)3][WCA] (2&#8201;a: E=P, WCA=TEFCl; 2&#8201;b: E=As, WCA=TEF) (TEF=[Al{OC(CF3)3}4]&#8722;, TEFCl=[Al{(OC(CF3)2(CCl3)}4]&#8722;). Furthermore, by using two equivalents of PH2BH2&#8901;NMe3, a Tl(I)&#8208;mediated P&#8722;P coupling takes place in CH2Cl2 as solvent resulting in [Me3N&#8901;BH2PH2PHBH2&#8901;NMe3][WCA] (WCA=TEF, 3&#8201;a; BArCl, 3&#8201;b; TEFCl, 3&#8201;c). In contrast, for the arsenic derivatives 1&#8201;b and 2&#8201;b, no coupling reaction is observed. The underlying chemical processes are elucidated by quantum chemical computations.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reactions of NMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-stabilized pnictogenylboranes&lt;/b&gt; with Tl(I) salts of weakly coordinating anions led to rare examples of Tl coordination compounds [Tl(EH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;NMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;

         <title>Dioxygen Splitting by a Tantalum(V) Complex Ligated by a Rigid, Redox Non&#8208;Innocent Pincer Ligand
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a tantalum(V) dichloride complex ligated by a rigid and redox non&#8208;innocent pincer ligand is reported. Cyclic voltammetry and derivatization reactions show that up to two electrons can be transferred from the ligand to the metal. Exposing this complex to O2 leads to the formation of an oxygen bridged dinuclear complex resulting from the full reduction of O2 to O2&#8722;.







Abstract
The reaction of TaMe3Cl2 with the rigid acridane&#8208;derived trisamine H3NNN yields the tantalum(V) complex [TaCl2(NNNcat)]. Subsequent reaction with dioxygen results in the full four&#8208;electron reduction of O2 yielding the oxido&#8208;bridged bimetallic complex [{TaCl2(NNNsq)}2O]. This dinuclear complex features an open&#8208;shell ground state due to partial ligand oxidation and was comprehensively characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, LIFDI mass spectrometry, NMR, EPR, IR and UV/VIS/NIR spectroscopy. The mechanism of O2 activation was investigated by DFT calculations revealing initial binding of O2 to the tantalum(V) center followed by complete O2 scission to produce a terminal oxido&#8208;complex.

         <dc:description>We herein report the design and scalable synthesis of three new Co(III) complexes, which have an unusual hydrocarbon &#951; 1 &#8208;alkyl&#8208; &#951; 3 &#8208;allyl&#8208; &#951; 5 &#8208;cyclopentadienyl ligation structure, from the reactions of readily available cobalt(II) compound CoCl 2 (PPh 3 ) 2 and biomass material &#946; &#8208;pinene via C&#8211;C bond activation. These Co(III) complexes are air&#8208;stable, fairly volatile, and thermally stable, so they are excellent candidates as the metal precursors for the vapour deposition of cobalt&#8208;containing thin films.

         <title>X&#8208;ray Triggered Coordination Bond Breakage in Dysprosium&#8208;organic Framework and Its Impact on Magnetic Properties</title>

         <dc:description>Photosensitive lanthanide&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule magnets (Ln&#8208;SMM) are very attractive for their potential applications in information storage, switching, and sensors. However, the light&#8208;driven structural transformation in Ln&#8208;SMMs hardly changes the coordination number of the lanthanide ion. Herein we report for the first time that X&#8208;ray (&#955; = 0.71073 &#197;) irradiation can break the coordination bond of Dy&#8208;OH2 in the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) metal&#8208;organic framework
Dy2(amp2H2)3(H2O)6&#8729;4H2O (MDAF&#8208;5), where the {Dy2(OPO)2} dimers are crosslinked by dianthracene&#8208;phosphonate ligands. The structural transformation proceeds in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SC&#8208;SC) fashion, forming the new phase Dy2(amp2H2)3(H2O)4&#8729;4H2O (MDAF&#8208;5X). The phase transition is accompanied by a significant change in magnetic properties due to the alteration in coordination geometry of the DyIII ion from a distorted pentagonal bipyramid in MDAF&#8208;5 to a distorted octahedron in MDAF&#8208;5&#8208;X.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of TiO2/SrTiO3 Heterojunction Derived from Monolayer Ti3C2 MXene for Efficient Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Construction of heterojunction at the atomic scale to ensure efficient charge separation for improvement of photocatalytic water splitting is challenging. Herein, a facile hydrothermal method has been applied for the in&#8208;situ fabrication of TiO2/SrTiO3&#160;heterojunction, using the monolayer Ti3C2&#160;MXene as the template and reactant. It is found that the sample with the hydrothermal reaction time of 60 min exhibits the highest H2 evolution rate with the sacrificial reagents, due to the efficient charge separation of TiO2/SrTiO3 heterojunction as Ti3C2 derivative. In addition, the sample shows the best overall water splitting performance at a hydrothermal reaction time of 120 min, where TiO2 is nearly converted to SrTiO3, due to the fast kinetic process and low structural defects of SrTiO3. This work not only provides a simple strategy for the&#160;fabrication of heterojunction photocatalysts but also demonstrates the difference in optimization of half&#8208;reaction and overall water splitting reaction.</dc:description>

In addition, the sample shows the best overall water splitting performance at a hydrothermal reaction time of 120 min, where TiO2 is nearly converted to SrTiO3, due to the fast kinetic process and low structural defects of SrTiO3. This work not only provides a simple strategy for the&#160;fabrication of heterojunction photocatalysts but also demonstrates the difference in optimization of half-reaction and overall water splitting reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoredox Catalyzed Single C&#8211;F Bond Activation of Trifluoromethyl Ketones: A Solvent Controlled Divergent Access of gem&#8208;Difluoromethylene Containing Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective defluorinative functionalization of trifluoromethyl ketones is a long&#8208;standing challenge owing to the exhaustive mode of the process. To meet the demands for the installation of the gem&#8208;difluoromethylene unit for the construction of the molecular architectures of well&#8208;known pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, a distinct pathway is thereby highly desirable. Here, we introduce a protocol that allows the divergent synthesis of gem&#8208;difluoromethylene group containing tetrahydrofuran derivatives and linear ketones via single C&#8211;F bond activation of trifluoromethyl ketones using visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis in the presence of suitable olefins as trapping partner. The choice of appropriate solvent and catalyst plays a significant role in controlling the divergent behavior of this protocol. Highly reducing photo&#8208;excited catalysts are found to be responsible for the generation of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoromethyl ketone (DFMK) radicals as the key intermediate via a SET process. This protocol also results in a high diastereoselectivity towards the formation of partially fluorinated cyclic ketal derivatives with simultaneous construction of one C&#8211;C and two C&#8211;O bonds. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art DFT calculations are performed to address the origin of diastereoselectivity as well as the divergence of this protocol.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of a Bifunctionalized Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) Anchor Useful for the Study of GPI Biology</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new, bifunctional glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) derivative containing the highly conserved core structure of all natural GPI anchors with a photoactivable diazirine in the lipid chain and clickable alkynes in the glycan was synthesized by a convergent [3 + 2] glycosylation strategy with late stage protecting group manipulation and regioselective phosphorylation. The challenges of this synthesis were due to the presence of several distinctive functional groups in the synthetic target, which complicated the protection tactics, in addition to the inherent difficulties associated with GPI synthesis. This bifunctional GPI derivative can cross&#8208;react with molecules in proximity upon photoactivation and be subsequently labeled with other molecular tags via click reaction. Therefore, it should be a valuable probe for biological studies of GPIs, such as analysis of GPI&#8208;interacting membrane proteins, and gaining insights into their functional mechanisms.</dc:description>

X&#8208;ray single crystal diffraction reveals the presence of Cl&#183;&#183;&#183;C=O interactions in CH2Cl2&#204;1 host&#8208;guest complex and multiple intermolecular C=O&#183;&#183;&#183;C=O interactions between molecules 1 in crystalline state. The intermolecular C=O&#183;&#183;&#183;C=O interactions as attractive driving force led to unprecedented self&#8208;assembly of nanotube with diameter around 1.4 nm and inner surface engineered by aromatic rings. SEM and TEM images of the self&#8208;assembly of 1 demonstrated temperature&#8208;dependent morphologies which allows the observation of spheres at 25 &#176;C and rods at 0 &#176;C, respectively. XRD analysis indicated consistent hexagonal patterns in the self&#8208;assembly and single crystal lattice, indicating the nanotubes driven by C=O&#183;&#183;&#183;C=O interactions constitute the basic structural architectures of both aggregates. The nanoscopic tubes (pores) formed in the rodlike single crystal engendering the separation of moving dyes were preliminarily investigated by a single&#8208;crystal chromatography and crystal&#8208;packed column chromatography.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Insulin, a main medication to control glycemia of type 1 and advanced type 2 diabetes, faces problems of the short half&#8208;life and poor stability during its clinical use. Zwitterionic polymer shows unique properties of antifouling and low immunogenicity. Here, we have synthesized a new insulin&#8208;zwitterionic polymer conjugate (INS&#8208;PMPC) through grafting&#8208;from strategy by controlled radical polymerization. Apart from showing excellent stability upon heat and mechanical agitation, the resulting INS&#8208;PMPC conjugate provided over 20 h of glycemic control due to improved pharmacokinetics in diabetic mice with one single subcutaneous injection. Most importantly, this insulin&#8208;zwitterionic polymer conjugate significantly decreases the incidence of hypoglycemia.</dc:description>

         <title>Revisiting the Reaction of IPr with Tritylium: An Alternative Mechanistic Pathway</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite a recent proposal on the mechanism of a single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) process between tritylium and 2,6&#8208;bis(diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (IPr) based on evidence of transient IPr radical cation intermediate ([IPr]&#9679;+) formation, such oxidation is still contentious because of the high oxidation potential of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes. Our experimental analysis indicates that the appearance of deep purple color, previously considered to be from transient [IPr]&#9679;+, originates from a zwitterionic intermediate (3a), not a radical cation. Here, we propose an alternative mechanism for the reaction involving tritylium and IPr. This mechanism is noteworthy for explaining how [NHC&#8211;H]+ can be generated without the formation of transient [NHC]&#9679;+, which has been frequently proposed as an intermediate for the reaction between NHC and oxidants. These results also show that a transient strong single&#8208;electron donor (3a) could be generated by the alternative mechanism for oxidants using NHCs, which is a more feasible explanation for the reactivity of NHCs with oxidants.</dc:description>

When complementing the ligand system with fluorinated side chains, the complex is strongly accumulated at the IL/gas interface, while in an equivalent solution of a complex without these substituents no such effect could be observed. This buoy&#8208;like behavior induces strong population of the complex at the outermost molecular layer close to surface saturation, which was studied over a range from 5%mol to 30%mol. Thereby, the surface enrichment is found to be most efficient at lowest concentration which is particularly favorable for catalytic applications such as supported ionic liquid phase (SILP) catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Disentangling the Effect of Pressure and Mixing on a Mechanochemical Bromination Reaction by Solid&#8208;state NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanical forces, including compressive stresses, have a significant impact on chemical reactions. Besides the preparative opportunities, mechanochemical conditions benefit from the absence of any organic solvent, the possibility of a significant synthetic acceleration and unique reaction pathways. Together with an accurate characterization of ball&#8208;milling products, the development of a deeper mechanistic understanding of the occurring transformations at a molecular level is critical for fully grasping the potential of organic mechanosynthesis. We herein studied a bromination of a cyclic sulfoximine in a mixer mill and used solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy for structural characterization of the reaction products. Magic&#8208;angle spinning (MAS) was applied for elucidating the product mixtures taken from the milling jar without introducing any further post&#8208;processing on the sample. Ex&#8208;situ 13C&#8208;detected NMR spectra of ball&#8208;milling products showed the formation of a rather crystalline solid phase with the regioselective bromination of the S&#8208;aryl group of the heterocycle in position 4. Completion is reached in less than 30 minutes as deduced from the NMR spectra. The bromination can also be achieved by magnetic stirring, but then, a longer reaction time is required. Mixing the solid educts in the NMR rotor allows to get in&#8208;situ insights into the reaction and enables the detection of a reaction intermediate. The pressure alone induced in the rotor by MAS is not sufficient to lead to full conversion and the reaction occurs on slower time scales than in the ball mill, which is crucial for analysing mixtures taken from the milling jar by solid&#8208;state NMR. Our data suggest that on top of centrifugal forces, an efficient mixing of the starting materials is required for reaching a complete reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Optical Manipulation of Gb3 Enriched Lipid Domains: Impact of Isomerization on Gb3&#8208;Shiga Toxin B Interaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switch it on: Gb3 sphingolipids with azobenzene groups serve as light&#8208;triggered nano&#8208;tools to control lipid and protein domains. By using the ability of Gb3 to bind Shiga toxin, its photo&#8208;isomerization alters the protein distribution on liquid&#8208;ordered domains and induces submicrometer&#8208;sized protein lakes. This may offer new strategies for controlling the structure of biological membranes including membrane&#8208;interacting proteins.







Abstract
The plasma membrane is a complex assembly of proteins and lipids that can self&#8208;assemble in submicroscopic domains commonly termed &#8220;lipid rafts&#8221;, which are implicated in membrane signaling and trafficking. Recently, photo&#8208;sensitive lipids were introduced to study membrane domain organization, and photo&#8208;isomerization was shown to trigger the mixing and de&#8208;mixing of liquid&#8208;ordered (lo) domains in artificial phase&#8208;separated membranes. Here, we synthesized globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) glycosphingolipids that harbor an azobenzene moiety at different positions of the fatty acid to investigate light&#8208;induced membrane domain reorganization, and that serve as specific receptors for the protein Shiga toxin (STx). Using phase&#8208;separated supported lipid bilayers on mica surfaces doped with four different photo&#8208;Gb3 molecules, we found by fluorescence microscopy and atomic force microscopy that liquid disordered (ld) domains were formed within lo domains upon trans&#8208;cis photo&#8208;isomerization. The fraction and size of these ld domains were largest for Gb3 molecules with the azobenzene group at the end of the fatty acid. We further investigated the impact of domain reorganization on the interaction of the B&#8208;subunits of STx with the photo&#8208;Gb3. Fluorescence and atomic force micrographs clearly demonstrated that STxB binds to the lo phase if Gb3 is in the trans&#8208;configuration, whereas two STxB populations are formed if the photo&#8208;Gb3 is switched to the cis&#8208;configuration highlighting the idea of manipulating lipid&#8208;protein interactions with a light stimulus.

         <title>Quest for the Most Aromatic Pathway in Charged Expanded Porphyrins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we show that the search for the most aromatic pathway in charged expanded porphyrins becomes a more puzzling quest than their neutral analogue structures. Among the most popular aromatic indices, AVmin turns out to be the most useful tool seeking the most aromatic path.







Abstract
Despite the central role of aromaticity in the chemistry of expanded porphyrins, the evaluation of aromaticity remains difficult for these extended macrocycles. The presence of multiple conjugation pathways and different planar and nonplanar &#960;&#8208;conjugation topologies makes the quantification of global and local aromaticity even more challenging. In neutral expanded porphyrins, it is established the predominance of the aromatic conjugation pathway passing through the imine&#8208;type nitrogens and circumventing the amino NH groups. However, for charged macrocycles, the question about the main conjugation circuit remains open. Accordingly, different conjugation pathways in a set of neutral, anionic, and cationic expanded porphyrins were investigated by means of several aromaticity indices rooted in the structural, magnetic, and electronic criteria. Overall, our results reveal the predominance of the conjugation pathway that passes through all nitrogen atoms to describe the aromaticity of deprotonated expanded porphyrins, while the outer pathway through the perimeter carbon atoms becomes the most aromatic in protonated macrocycles. In nonplanar and charged macrocycles, a discrepancy between electronic and magnetic descriptors is observed. Nevertheless, our work demonstrates AVmin remains the best tool to determine the main conjugation pathway of expanded porphyrins.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cation&#8208;tuning engineering strategy as a new emerging frontier has attracted significant attention for transition metal&#8208;based catalysts. Its advantages are summarized with special emphasis on altering the electronic structure and charge distribution of transition metal&#8208;based catalysts. This Concept also reviews its application for the oxygen reduction reaction, the oxygen evolution reaction, and Zn air batteries, and also proposes future opportunities.







Abstract
Cation&#8208;tuning engineering has become a new frontier in altering the electronic structure of electrocatalysts, which has been employed to enhance their electrochemical performance. Significant efforts have been made to promote the electrochemical performance of transition metal&#8208;based materials during oxygen electrocatalysis and related energy devices such as Zn&#8208;air batteries. Herein, the advantages of cation&#8208;tuning engineering, including cation vacancies/defects and cation doping, in the modification of the electronic structure of transition metal oxide catalysts are discussed. Additionally, practical applications of the cation&#8208;tuning engineering strategy are reviewed in detail with a special emphasis on oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. Lastly, challenges and future opportunities in this field are also proposed.

         <title>Recyclable GO&#8208;Arginine Hybrids for CO2 Fixation into Cyclic Carbonates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO2 fix: A new covalently modified graphene&#8722;arginine oxide has been synthesized on a gram&#8208;scale, spectroscopically characterized and effectively used for CO2 fixation and transformation into cyclic carbonates. Dedicated control experiments led to a full rationale of the reaction profile.







Abstract
New covalently modified GO&#8208;guanidine materials have been realized in a gram&#8208;scale synthesis and purified by an innovative microfiltration. The use of these composites in the fixation of CO2 into cyclic carbonates is demonstrated. Mild operating conditions, high yields (up to 85&#8201;%), wide scope (15 examples) and recoverability/reusability (up to 5 cycles) of the material account for the efficiency of the protocol. Dedicated control experiments shed light on the activation modes exerted by GO&#8208;l&#8208;arginine during the ring&#8208;opening/closing synthetic sequence.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fix&lt;/b&gt;: A new covalently modified graphene&#8722;arginine oxide has been synthesized on a gram-scale, spectroscopically characterized and effectively used for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation and transformation into cyclic carbonates. Dedicated control experiments led to a full rationale of the reaction profile.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New covalently modified GO-guanidine materials have been realized in a gram-scale synthesis and purified by an innovative microfiltration. The use of these composites in the fixation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into cyclic carbonates is demonstrated. Mild operating conditions, high yields (up to 85&#8201;%), wide scope (15 examples) and recoverability/reusability (up to 5 cycles) of the material account for the efficiency of the protocol. Dedicated control experiments shed light on the activation modes exerted by GO-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-arginine during the ring-opening/closing synthetic sequence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Small&#8208;Molecule Probe with a Dual Function of miRNA Inhibition and Target identification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;molecule probe derived from norathyriol with a dual function of miRNA inhibition and target identification was developed. In combination with bioorthogonal click chemistry, we identified AGO2 as the target of this probe.







Abstract
By virtue of their key roles in pathologies, miRNAs represent a promising class of therapeutic targets. While high&#8208;fidelity small&#8208;molecule modulators of miRNAs can be identified via high&#8208;throughput screening using cellular reporter systems, their modes of action are elusive due to the lack of proper tools. Here, we report a small&#8208;molecule probe, 1&#8201;a, that is capable of elucidating its biological target along miRNA inhibition. Derived from norathyriol, a nature product, 1&#8201;a possessed a bioorthogonal alkyne moiety for subsequent labeling via copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition chemistry. We demonstrated that 1&#8201;a inhibited a panel of different miRNAs by blocking their loading onto argonaute 2 (AGO2), which is the key protein responsible for miRNA function. With the alkyne handle, we successfully identified AGO2 as an intracellular target of 1&#8201;a. Therefore, this work presents a novel small&#8208;molecule tool for suppressing and probing miRNA regulatory pathways.

         <title>A Hydride&#8208;Substituted Homoleptic Silylborate: How Similar is it to its Diborane(6)&#8208;Dianion Isostere?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 1,2&#8208;dihydride&#8208;substituted silylborate was synthesized via an &#8220;Umpolung&#8221; approach using a chlorosilane and a boron&#8208;centered nucleophile. Except for the B&#8722;Si vs. B&#8722;B cores, the silylborate is identical to a prominent diborane(6) dianion, allowing a direct comparison of their reactivities after H&#8722; abstraction. The resulting B(&#956;&#8208;H)E product is isolable for E=B, but constitutes a (still synthetically useful) transient intermediate for E=Si.







Abstract
The B&#8208;nucleophilic 9H&#8208;9&#8208;borafluorene dianion reacts with 9&#8208;chloro&#8208;9&#8208;silafluorene to afford air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable silylborate salts M[Ar2(H)B&#8722;Si(H)Ar2] (M[HBSiH], M=Li, Na). Li[HBSiH] and Me3SiCl give the B&#8722;pyridine adduct Ar2(py)B&#8722;Si(H)Ar2 ((py)BSiH) or the chlorosilane Li[Ar2(H)B&#8722;Si(Cl)Ar2] (Li[HBSiCl]) in C6H6&#8208;pyridine or THF. In both cases, the first step is H&#8722; abstraction at the B center. The resulting free borane subsequently binds a py or thf ligand. While the py adduct is stable at room temperature, the thf adduct undergoes a 1,2&#8208;H shift via the cyclic B(&#956;&#8208;H)Si intermediate BHSi, which is afterwards attacked at the Si atom by a Cl&#8722; ion to give Li[HBSiCl]. DFT calculations were employed to support the proposed reaction mechanism and to characterize the electronic structure of BHSi. Treatment of Li[HBSiCl] with the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene IMe introduces the neutral donor at the Si atom and leads to Ar2(H)B&#8722;Si(IMe)Ar2 (HBSi(IMe)), a donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;stabilized silylene.

         <title>Near&#8208;infrared Emissive Hypervalent Compounds with Germanium(IV)&#8208;Fused Azobenzene &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel molecular design for showing near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission is still required for satisfying growing demands for NIR&#8208;light technology. In this research, we discover hypervalent compounds with germanium(Ge)&#8208;fused azobenzene (GAz) scaffolds can exhibit NIR emission (&#955;PL = 690~721 nm, &#934;PL = 0.03~0.04) despite compact &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems. The unique optical properties are derived from trigonal bipyramidal geometry of the hypervalent compounds constructed by combination of Ge and azobenzene&#8208;based tridentate ligands. Experimental and theoretical calculation results disclose that germanium&#8211;nitrogen (Ge&#8722;N) coordination at the equatorial position strongly reduces the energy level of LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital), and the three&#8208;center four&#8208;electron (3c&#8208;4e) bond in the apical position effectively rises the energy level of HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital). It is emphasized that large narrowing of the HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap is achieved just by forming the hypervalent bond. In addition, the narrow&#8208;energy&#8208;gap property can be enhanced by extension of &#960;&#8208;conjugation. The obtained &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer shows efficient NIR emission both in solution (&#955;PL = 770 nm and &#934;PL = 0.10) and film (&#955;PL = 807 nm and &#934;PL = 0.04). These results suggest that collaboration of a hypervalent bond and a &#960;&#8208;conjugated system is a novel and effective strategy for tuning electronic properties even in the NIR region.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution by a De Novo Designed Metalloprotein that Undergoes Ni&#8208;Mediated Oligomerization Shift</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>De novo metalloprotein design involves the construction of proteins guided by specific repeat patterns of polar and apolar residues, which, upon self&#8208;assembly, provides a suitable environment to bind metals and produce artificial metalloenzymes. While a wide range of functionalities have been realized in de novo designed metalloproteins, the functional repertoire of such constructs towards alternative energy&#8208;relevant catalysis is currently limited. Here we show the application of de novo approach to design a functional H2 evolving protein. The design involved the assembly of an amphiphilic peptide featuring cysteines at tandem a/d sites of each helix. Intriguingly, upon NiII addition, the oligomers shift from a major trimeric assembly to a mix of dimers and trimers. The metalloprotein produced H2 photocatalytically with a bell&#8208;shape pH dependence, having a maximum activity at pH 5.5. Transient absorption spectroscopy is used to determine the timescales of electron transfer as a function of pH. Selective outer sphere mutations are made to probe how the local environment tunes activity. A preferential enhancement of activity is observed via steric modulation above the NiII site, towards the N&#8208;termini, compared to below the NiII site towards the C&#8208;termini.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Assisted Metal&#8208;Air Batteries: Recent Progress, Challenges and Opportunities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To meet the need of high energy density, long durability, safe and cost&#8208;efficient energy conversion and storage devices, metal&#8208;air batteries like Li&#8208;O  2  &#160;and Zn&#8208;O  2  &#160;batteries have received enormous attentions and made exciting developments in the past decade.

         <title>A Foldable Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Battery Using Gear&#8208;Structured Composite as Freestanding Cathode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A foldable battery with high flexibility provides a great potential in various wearable electronic devices in health and fitness tracking, chronic disease management, performance monitoring, navigation tracking, and portable gears for soldiers. We report a highly flexible, self&#8208;healing Zn&#8208;ion battery by using a free&#8208;standing cathode that is composed of a 3D gear&#8208;like NH4V4O10@C composite on carbon paper. The battery remained a capacity up to 102.4 mAh g&#8208;1&#160;even after folding 60 times with a high angle of 180&#176;. An aqueous hydrogel consisting polyvinyl alcohol, glycerin and Zn(CF3SO3)2&#160;was used as electrolyte, which showed as high as&#160;580% tensile strain under a loading weight of 78 N.&#160;The battery exhibited a better capacity retention of over&#160;100 mAh g&#8208;1and Coulombic efficiency of over 99.8%&#160;after cutting and twisting&#160;to 90&#176;, indicating&#160;a great self&#8208;healing performance. The gear&#8208;like geometry largely improved the volume accommodation due to the increased interval space between the blades and the outwards configuration. While the Zn2+&#160;ionic conductivity was improved due to rapid re&#8208;binding of plenty of existing hydroxyl groups from electrolyte and the enhanced contact surface area and diffusion route from the cathode material. The highly flexible, safe aqueous Zn&#8208;ion battery opens a practical way in powering various carry&#8208;on electronics under mechanical agitations.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Triptycene Annulation on the Photochromism of Diphenylnaphthopyrans: Entropic Control of Thermal Reversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regioisomeric naphthopyrans annulated with triptycene, i.e.,  Prox&#8208;NP  and  Dist&#8208;NP  , display divergent photochromic behaviors. While steady&#8208;state photolysis of  Dist&#8208;NP  led to a very labile colored intermediate that is not observable at rt,  Prox&#8208;NP  yielded a remarkably stable species characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography as the TT&#173; isomer of  o  &#8208;quinonoid intermediate (  Prox&#8208;NPQ  ) with t  1/2  ca. 0.18 years at 298 K. The kinetic analysis of thermal reversion reveals that the bleaching of  Prox&#8208;NPQ  is entropically controlled; the steric effect due to the rigid triptycene scaffold renders  Prox&#8208;NP  a highly constrained system such that the photogenerated colored  o  &#8208;quinonoid form is more entropically relaxed. This constitutes the first instance of an entropically&#8208;controlled thermal reversion for the celebrated class of photochromic naphthopyrans. Based on the response of  Prox&#8208;NP  and its colored intermediate  Prox&#8208;NPQ  to different stimuli, namely, light, heat, and acid, the molecular system can be likened to a logic gate with the &#8216;INHIBIT&#8217; function.</dc:description>

         <title>Bridging Chemical Knowledge and Machine Learning for Performance Prediction of Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Predicting organic transformations is one of the most critical challenges in molecular syntheses. The synergy between machine learning and chemical knowledge provides a distinctive and powerful strategy for syntheses predictions. This Minireview summarizes the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art embedding approaches and model designs for developing synthesis&#8208;sensitive machine learning models to allow for robust yield and selectivity predictions in molecular syntheses.







Abstract
Recent years have witnessed a boom of machine learning (ML) applications in chemistry, which reveals the potential of data&#8208;driven prediction of synthesis performance. Digitalization and ML modelling are the key strategies to fully exploit the unique potential within the synergistic interplay between experimental data and the robust prediction of performance and selectivity. A series of exciting studies have demonstrated the importance of chemical knowledge implementation in ML, which improves the model's capability for making predictions that are challenging and often go beyond the abilities of human beings. This Minireview summarizes the cutting&#8208;edge embedding techniques and model designs in synthetic performance prediction, elaborating how chemical knowledge can be incorporated into machine learning until June 2022. By merging organic synthesis tactics and chemical informatics, we hope this Review can provide a guide map and intrigue chemists to revisit the digitalization and computerization of organic chemistry principles.

         <title>Merging Rh&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8208;H Functionalization and Cascade Cyclization to Enable Propargylic Alcohols as Three&#8208;Carbon Synthons
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reverse regioselective insertion of propargyl alcohols into a rhodacycle is utilized to achieve indole&#8208;based precursors of a vinylogous iminium ion intermediate. Generation and trapping of this intermediate in&#8197;situ with different internal and external nucleophiles results in polycyclic cores of indole&#8208;containing natural products. Experimental studies along with DFT, NCI plots throw light on the reaction pathway.







Abstract
Reported herein is a reactivity of propargyl alcohols as &#8220;Three&#8208;Carbon Synthons&#8221; in a Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization of acetanilides, leading to the synthesis of core structures of isocryptolepine, &#947;&#8208;carbolines, dihydrochromeno[2,3&#8208;b]indoles, and diindolylmethanes (DIM) derivatives. The transformation involves a rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization and heteroannulation to yield indoles followed by a cascade cyclization with both external and internal nucleophiles to afford diverse products. The role of the hydroxy group, the key function of the silver additive, the origin of the reverse regioselectivity and the rate&#8208;determining step, are rationalized in conformity with the combination of experimental, noncovalent interaction analysis and DFT studies. This protocol is endowed with several salient features, including one&#8208;pot multistep cascade approach, exclusive regioselectivity, good functional group tolerance and synthesis of variety of molecular frameworks.

         <title>Interfacial C&#8722;S Bonds of g&#8208;C3N4/Bi19Br3S27 S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction for Enhanced Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction
</title>

         <dc:description>
The effective construction of interfacial C&#8722;S bond and built&#8208;in electric field in g&#8208;C3N4/Bi19Br3S27 S&#8208;scheme heterojunction improves the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, resulting excellent CO2 reduction performance.







Abstract
Step&#8208;scheme (S&#8208;scheme) heterojunctions have been extensively studied in photocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction due to their excellent charge separation and high redox ability. The built&#8208;in electric field at the interface of a S&#8208;scheme heterojunction serves as the driving force for charge transfer, however, the poor interfacial contact greatly restricts the carrier migration rate. Herein, we synthesized the g&#8208;C3N4/Bi19Br3S27 S&#8208;scheme heterostructure through in&#8197;situ deposition of Bi19Br3S27 (BBS) on porous g&#8208;C3N4 (P&#8208;CN) nanosheets. The C&#8722;S bonds formed at the interface help to enhance the built&#8208;in electric field, thereby promoting the charge transfer and separation. As a result, the CO2 reduction reaction performance of 10&#8201;%Bi19Br3S27/g&#8208;C3N4 (BBS/P&#8208;CN) reaches 32.78&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1h&#8722;1, which is 341.4 and 18.7 times higher than that of pure BBS and P&#8208;CN, respectively. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) prove the presence of chemical bonds (C&#8722;S) between the P&#8208;CN and BBS. The S&#8208;scheme charge&#8208;transfer mechanism was analyzed via XPS and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work provides a new idea for designing heterojunction photocatalysts with interfacial chemical bonds to achieve high charge&#8208;transfer and catalytic activity.

The built-in electric field at the interface of a S-scheme heterojunction serves as the driving force for charge transfer, however, the poor interfacial contact greatly restricts the carrier migration rate. Herein, we synthesized the g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/Bi&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;27&lt;/sub&gt; S-scheme heterostructure through in&#8197;situ deposition of Bi&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;27&lt;/sub&gt; (BBS) on porous g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (P-CN) nanosheets. The C&#8722;S bonds formed at the interface help to enhance the built-in electric field, thereby promoting the charge transfer and separation. As a result, the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction performance of 10&#8201;%Bi&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;27&lt;/sub&gt;/g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (BBS/P-CN) reaches 32.78&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is 341.4 and 18.7 times higher than that of pure BBS and P-CN, respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) prove the presence of chemical bonds (C&#8722;S) between the P-CN and BBS. The S-scheme charge-transfer mechanism was analyzed via XPS and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work provides a new idea for designing heterojunction photocatalysts with interfacial chemical bonds to achieve high charge-transfer and catalytic activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Readout of the Mechanical Response of a Bis&#8208;acridinium [2]Rotaxane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemochromic and electrochemical properties of a switchable bis&#8208;acridinium [2]rotaxane led to two different mechanical responses and an ON/OFF reading of the motion in the assembly. This work could lead to the use of the acridinium core as a recognition unit for radical templating through &#960;&#8208;mer formation.







Abstract
A [2]rotaxane built around a multi&#8208;responsive bis&#8208;acridinium macrocycle has been synthesized. Structural investigation has confirmed the interlocked nature of the molecule, and MD simulations illuminated its conformational dynamics with atomic resolution. Both halochromic and redox&#8208;switching properties were explored to shed light on the mechanical response and electronic changes that occur in the bis&#8208;acridinium [2]rotaxane. The topology of the rotaxane led to different mechanical behaviors upon addition of hydroxide ions or reduction that were easily detected by UV/Vis spectroscopy and electrochemistry.

         <title>Heterointerface Engineering of ZnO/CdS Heterostructures through ZnS Layers for Photocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Caught in the middle: By introducing a heterointerface layer of ZnS between ZnO and CdS, a Z&#8208;scheme charge&#8208;transfer channel is promoted and the as&#8208;prepared heterostructures display superior photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven water splitting to produce clean and renewable hydrogen offers a green strategy to address the energy crisis and environmental pollution. Heterostructure catalysts are receiving increasing attention for photocatalytic hydrogen generation. ZnO/ZnS/CdS and ZnO/CdS heterostructures have been successfully designed and prepared according to two different strategies. By introducing a heterointerface layer of ZnS between ZnO and CdS, a Z scheme charge&#8208;transfer channel was promoted and achieved superior photocatalytic performance. A highest hydrogen generation rate of 156.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 was achieved by precise control of the thickness of the heterointerface layer and of the CdS shell. These findings demonstrated that heterostructures are promising catalysts for solar&#8208;driven water splitting, and that heterointerface engineering is an effective way to improve the photocatalytic properties of heterostructures.

         <title>Stimulus&#8208;Responsive Lanthanide MOF Materials Encapsulated with Viologen Derivatives: Characterization, Photophysical Properties and Sensing on Nitrophenols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Six novel 3D Ln&#8208;NH2BDC MOFs encapsulating pbpyCl2 have been designed and synthesized. They are sensitive to visible light and exhibit a good reversible photochromic and photomodulated fluorescence phenomena. Moreover, they have a good detection effect on nitrophenols, especially 2,4,6&#8208;trinitrophenol (TNP).







Abstract
Viologens (1,1&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted 4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyridyls) possessing electron&#8208;deficient properties and redox activity are a class of suitable chromophores to assemble metal&#8211;organic hybrid photochromic materials. Thus, viologen&#8208;functionalized metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted much attention for their photochromic properties; however, the syntheses of lanthanide&#8208;viologen hybrid crystalline photochromic materials still face many challenges. For example, the structures and properties of the final products are difficult to predict and are limited by molecular configurations. In this work, host&#8208;guest composite&#8208;material Ln&#8208;NH2BDC&#8208;pbpy MOFs were constructed by encapsulating viologen derivative pbpyCl2. The pbpy2+ moieties are uniformly embed by their &#960;&#8208;&#960; conjugation in the pores of the 3D structure by electrostatic interactions. Due to the encapsulation of the chromophore pbpy2+ moieties, Ln&#8208;NH2BDC&#8208;pbpy MOFs have reversible photochromic properties: they can change color after irradiation and can return to the original color after being protected from light or heating. Interestingly, the fluorescence intensity decreases with illumination time and recovers in the dark. As a result, Ln&#8208;NH2BDC&#8208;pbpy MOFs show both photochromic and photomodulated fluorescence. Based on the outstanding fluorescence performance of the Ln&#8208;NH2BDC&#8208;pbpy MOFs, they also show a wonderful effect for detecting nitrophenols, especially TNP.

         <title>Carba&#8208;Sugar Analogs of Glucosamine&#8208;6&#8208;Phosphate: New Activators for the glmS Riboswitch</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of carba&#8208;sugars with an alkoxy substituent in the carba position has been synthesized. Key steps were a ring&#8208;closing metathesis and a hydroboration. The compounds have been tested for their ability to induce self&#8208;cleavage of the glmS ribozyme, which represents a potential drug target to fight bacterial resistance to antibiotics. Compound 32, with a methoxy substituent at the carba position, turned out to have the most promising properties.







Abstract
Riboswitches are 5&#8217;&#8208;untranslated mRNA regions mostly found in bacteria. They are promising drug targets to overcome emerging bacterial resistance against commonly used antibiotics. The glmS riboswitch is unique among the family of riboswitches as it is a ribozyme that undergoes self&#8208;cleavage upon binding to glucosamine&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate (GlcN6P). Previously, we showed that carba glucosamine&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate (carba&#8208;GlcN6P) induces self&#8208;cleavage of the riboswitch with a potency similar to that of GlcN6P. Here, we report a synthetic approach to a new class of carba&#8208;GlcN6P derivatives with an alkoxy substituent in the carba position. Key features of the synthesis are a ring closing metathesis followed by a hydroboration. The strategy gives access to libraries of carba&#8208;GlcN6P derivatives. Ribozyme cleavage assays unraveled new activators for the glmS riboswitch from Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium difficile.

         <title>Dithiolopyrrolones are Prochelators that are Activated by Glutathione</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural prochelators: Dithiolopyrrolones are promising antibiotics. They are reduced by glutathione after cell entry. The activated dithiol chelates essential metal ions in cells. We also report an expedient synthesis for natural derivatives.







Abstract
Dithiolopyrrolones (DTPs), such as holomycin, are natural products that hold promise as scaffolds for antibiotics as they exhibit inhibitory activity against antibiotic&#8208;resistant pathogens. They consist of a unique bicyclic core containing a disulfide that is crucial for their biological activity. Herein, we establish the DTPs as prochelators. We show that the disulfides are reduced at cellular gluathione levels. This activates the drugs and initiates interactions with targets, particularly metal coordination. In addition, we report an expedient synthesis for the DTPs thiolutin and aureothricin, providing facile access to important natural DTPs and derivatives thereof.

         <dc:description>
The asymmetric oxidative C&#8722;C homocoupling reaction of diarylamines using air as final oxidant is catalyzed by a hexadecafluorinated iron&#8208;phthalocyanine complex and an axially chiral biarylphosphoric acid. A radical cation&#8208;chiral phosphate anion pair is proposed as key intermediate responsible for the asymmetric induction.







Abstract
We describe an iron&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric oxidative C&#8722;C coupling of diarylamines which proceeds at room temperature with air as final oxidant. Using hexadecafluorophthalocyanine&#8208;iron(II) as catalyst in the presence of catalytic amounts of an axially chiral biarylphosphoric acid, the resulting chiral 2,2&#8242;&#8208;diamino&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biaryls are obtained in up to 90&#8201;% ee as confirmed by chiral HPLC. A detailed mechanism has been proposed with a radical cation&#8208;chiral phosphate ion pair as key intermediate leading to the observed asymmetric induction.

         <title>Organophotocatalytic [2+2] Cycloaddition of Electron&#8208;Deficient Styrenes
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The [2+2] cycloaddition of alkenes is a powerful method of preparing cyclobutanes, but the use of electron&#8208;deficient styrenes has been largely neglected so far. By using the organophotocatalyst 4CzIPN, a visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated procedure to cyclobutane motifs bearing electron&#8208;deficient aryl substituents has been developed. Homodimerisations as well as intramolecular reactions to fused bicyclic motifs can be performed in good to excellent yields.







Abstract
A visible&#8208;light organophotocatalytic [2+2] cycloaddition of electron&#8208;deficient styrenes is described. Photocatalytic [2+2] cycloadditions are typically performed with electron&#8208;rich styrene derivatives or &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds, and with transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts. We have discovered that an organic cyanoarene photocatalyst is able to deliver high&#8208;value cyclobutane products bearing electron&#8208;deficient aryl substituents in good yields. A range of electron&#8208;deficient substituents are tolerated, and both homodimerisations and intramolecular [2+2] cycloadditions to fused bicyclic systems are available by using this methodology.

         <title>Li2Ba4Al2Ta2N8O, the First Barium Nitridoalumotantalate with BCT&#8208;Zeolite Type Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel compound Li2Ba4Al2Ta2N8O:Eu2+ was synthesized by a high&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state reaction in a tantalum ampule. The network in the structure of Li2Ba4Al2Ta2N8O is build up from AlN4 and TaN4 tetrahedra, which form a three&#8208;dimensional network corresponding to the BCT&#8208;zeolite type structure. The new compound is homeotypic to Li2Sr4Al2Ta2N8O and Li2Sr4Si4N8O but, additionally, it could be successfully doped with the activator ion Eu2+ exhibiting interesting luminescence properties. Characterization was done utilizing single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, and luminescence spectroscopy.







Abstract
Single&#8208;crystals of Li2Ba4Al2Ta2N8O:Eu2+ were synthesized from Ba3N2, Al2O3, Li3N, Eu2O3, and lithium metal by a high&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state reaction in a weld shut tantalum ampule. The crystal structure of Li2Ba4Al2Ta2N8O was determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and it crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pnnm (no. 58) with the lattice parameters a=1006.71(3), b=1026.58(3), c=607.10(2) pm, and a volume of V=0.62742(3) nm3. The compound is built up from AlN4 and TaN4 tetrahedra, which form a three&#8208;dimensional network corresponding to the BCT&#8208;zeolite type structure. Li2Ba4Al2Ta2N8O is homeotypic to Li2Sr4Si4N8O and Li2Sr4Al2Ta2N8O but, additionally, it could be successfully doped with the activator ion Eu2+ and hence features an experimental observed overall emission at &#955;max=565&#8197;nm (fwhm=89&#8197;nm) consisting of a superposition of two adjusted emission bands at &#955;max=557&#8197;nm (fwhm=69&#8197;nm) and at &#955;max=604&#8197;nm (fwhm=102&#8197;nm).

         <title>The Effect of Hydrogenation on the Contest between Aromaticity and Antiaromaticity in Norcorrole</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Magnetic shielding studies demonstrate that successive hydrogenation of NiII norcorrole (NiNc), a stable molecule combining aromatic and antiaromatic features, first weakens and then eliminates the central antiaromatic region, even though the NiNc antiaromatic &#8220;core&#8221;, a 14&#8208;membered conjugated cycle with 16 &#960; electrons, is formally preserved throughout the H2NiNc&#8722;H8NiNc series. The differences between aromatic and non&#8208;aromatic isotropic shielding distributions and nucleus&#8208;independent chemical shift (NICS) values in these hydrogenated porphyrin analogues are highlighted by comparing the results for the members of the H2NiNc&#8722;H8NiNc series to those for the aromatic NiII porphyrin complex. The results strongly support the unexpected and counterintuitive conclusion that H8NiNc will be nonaromatic, without even a trace of antiaromaticity. Based on these findings, H8NiNc is predicted to be the most stable member of the H2NiNc&#8722;H8NiNc series.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first concise and efficient synthesis of some fluorine&#8208;containing morpholino nucleosides analogs has been developed. One synthetic strategy was based on the oxidative ring cleavage of the vicinal diol unit of uridine, cytidine adenosine and guanosine derivatives, followed by cyclisation of the dialdehyde intermediates by double reductive amination with fluorinated primary amines to obtain various N&#8208;fluoroalkylated morpholinos. Another approach involved cyclisation of the diformyl intermediates with ammonia source, followed by dithiocarbamate formation and desulfurization&#8208;fluorination with diethylaminosulfur trifluoride yielding the corresponding morpholine&#8208;based nucleoside analogs with a N&#8208;CF3 element in their structure</dc:description>

         <title>Fast Cysteine Bioconjugation Chemistry</title>

Recently developed fast cysteine bioconjugation reactions are summarized in this Concept, with a focus on the mechanisms and design principles that underlie the high efficiency of the new cysteine&#8208;modifying reagents.







Abstract
Cysteine bioconjugation serves as a powerful tool in biological research and has been widely used for chemical modification of proteins, constructing antibody&#8208;drug conjugates, and enabling cell imaging studies. Cysteine conjugation reactions with fast kinetics and exquisite selectivity have been under heavy pursuit as they would allow clean protein modification with just stoichiometric amounts of reagents, which minimizes side reactions, simplifies purification and broadens functional group tolerance. In this concept, we summarize the recent advances in fast cysteine bioconjugation, and discuss the mechanism and chemical principles that underlie the high efficiencies of the newly developed cysteine reactive reagents.

         <title>Improved Dye Survival in Expansion Microscopy through Stabilizer&#8208;Conjugated Linkers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 66, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of stabilizer&#8208;containing multifunctional molecules has been developed and evaluated in expansion microscopy. These multifunctional molecules not only enable effective protection of dyes from radicals during polymerization, but also improve photostability while showing no negative impact on polymerization.







Abstract
Expansion microscopy (ExM) has been widely used to detect biomolecules in cultured cells and tissue samples due to its enablement of super resolution imaging with conventional microscopes, via physical expansion of samples. However, reaction conditions inherent to the process bring about strong fluorescent signal loss during polymerization and digestion and thus limit the brightness of the signal obtained post expansion. Here, we explore the impact of stabilizer&#8208;containing organic fluorophores in ExM, as a mitigation strategy for this radical&#8208;induced dye degradation. Through direct conjugation of 4&#8208;nitrophenylalanine (NPA) to our previously developed trifunctional reagents, we validate and demonstrate that these multifunctional linkers enable visualization of different organelles with improved fluorescent intensity, owning to protection of the dyes to radical induced degradation as well as to photoprotection upon imaging. At this point, we cannot disentangle the relative contribution of both mechanisms. Furthermore, we report anchoring linkers that allow straightforward application of NPA or Trolox to commercially available fluorophore&#8208;conjugated antibodies. We show that these anchoring linkers enable complete retention of biological targets while increasing fluorophore photostability. Our results provide guidance in exploring these stabilizer&#8208;modified agents in ExM and methods for increased signal survival through the polymerization steps of the ExM protocols.

         <title>Computational Insights of Selective Intramolecular O&#8208;atom Transfer Mediated by Bioinspired Copper Complexes</title>

Computational insights on reactivity: The stereoselective copper&#8208;mediated intramolecular C&#8722;H bond hydroxylation is investigated using DFT calculations. The computed mechanism involves a dinuclear side&#8208;on &#956;&#8208;&#951;2:&#951;2&#8208;peroxo dicopper(II) adduct in equilibrium with the key oxidizing intermediate bis(&#956;&#8208;oxo) dicopper(III) species. The difference of reactivity towards internal substrates bearing activated or non&#8208;activated C&#8722;H bonds is rationalized.







Abstract
The stereoselective copper&#8208;mediated hydroxylation of intramolecular C&#8722;H bonds from tridentate ligands is reinvestigated using DFT calculations. The computational study aims at deciphering the mechanism of C&#8722;H hydroxylation obtained after reaction of Cu(I) precursors with dioxygen, using ligands bearing either activated (L1) or non&#8208;activated (L2) C&#8722;H bonds. Configurational analysis allows rationalization of the experimentally observed regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. The computed mechanism involves the formation of a side&#8208;on peroxide species (P) in equilibrium with the key intermediate bis&#8208;(&#956;&#8208;oxo) isomer (O) responsible for the C&#8722;H activation step. The P/O equilibrium yields the same activation barrier for the two complexes. However, the main difference between the two model complexes is observed during the C&#8722;H activation step, where the complex bearing the non&#8208;activated C&#8722;H bonds yields a higher energy barrier, accounting for the experimental lack of reactivity of this complex under those conditions.

         <title>Continuous Charge Transport in Carbon Nitride Modulated by Interfacial Chemical Bond and Homophase Junction to Boost Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>

The electron transfer chain, which mimics the electron transport chain in natural photosynthetic system fabricated by the synergistic interfacial chemical bond and brookite TiO2 homophase junction promotes the charge separation efficiency in 2D carbon nitride.







Abstract
Efficient separation of photogenerated electrons and holes is of key importance in photocatalysis. Tuning the charge separation pathway is significant but still suffering from low efficiency for the charge extraction from semiconductors. Herein, taking 2D g&#8208;C3N4 (CN) nanosheets as a model photocatalyst, it was found the decoration of homophase junction between brookite TiO2 rods and nanoparticles (BN&#8208;BR) onto CN can effectively modulate photogenerated charge extraction and transfer in BN&#8208;BR/CN composites. The BN&#8208;BR/CN exhibits a remarkably enhanced photocatalytic H2 evolution under visible light irradiation (&#955;&gt;420&#8197;nm) compared with the single component. A continuous electron transfer channel constructed by an interfacial chemical bond Ti&#8722;O&#8722;N between CN and brookite rods (BR) and BN&#8208;BR homophase junction between brookite nanoparticles and rods was proposed to benefit the charge extraction and transfer. This work provides a strategy to tune the charge separation and transfer to facilitate the photocatalytic performance in heterogeneous photocatalysis.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Controlled Selective Mono&#8208; vs. Di&#8208;ortho&#8208;Arylation for the Synthesis of Arylhydrazine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 66, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective formation of mono&#8208; and double&#8208;arylated products at ortho position was feasible via the pyrazolone directing group. The selectivity of the palladium&#8208;catalyzed reaction was controlled by the temperature and derived from the structure of the used directing group. This allowed the achievement of unsymmetrical double&#8208;substituted arylated products in a one&#8208;pot procedure. Ortho&#8208;arylated pyrazolones underwent unusual decarboxylative cleavage under relatively mild conditions to form hydrazones.







Abstract
A method of palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation assisted with a 3,4,4&#8208;trimethylpyrazol&#8208;5&#8208;on directing group, selectively providing mono&#8208; and di&#8208;ortho&#8208;arylated products is reported. Steric hindrance appearing between the directing group and the already introduced aryl substituent enables control of mono&#8208; vs. diarylation selectivity by the temperature of the reaction. Taking advantage of this, a series of monosubstituted and disubstituted derivatives were obtained in good yields. Moreover, unsymmetrical double&#8208;arylation in a one&#8208;pot procedure was developed to give corresponding products in reasonable yields. Additionally, synthesis and X&#8208;ray study of intermediate palladium metallacycles of both, the first and second arylation reactions, were conducted. X&#8208;ray structure comparison emphasizes the geometrical differences that were consistent with the observed reactivity. Finally, decarboxylative cleavage of the pyrazolone directing group under mild conditions gave synthetically useful hydrazones. The presented solution opens the alternative synthetic way to such ortho arylated derivatives of arylhydrazines.

         <title>Restrictive Regulation of Ionic Liquid Quaternary Ammonium Salt in SBA&#8208;15 Pore Channel for Efficient Carbon Dioxide Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 66, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
SBA&#8208;15 with metal based quaternary ammonium salt was used for the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides. Ionic liquids grafting into the pore channel of SBA&#8208;15 provide an alternative chance to improve the catalytic performance at 1.5&#8197;MPa and 90 &#176;C.







Abstract
Herein, the synthesis of a new type of catalyst, SBA&#8722;M (Schiff complex of different metal types grafted on SBA&#8208;15) based on a quaternization reaction, is described. Various amounts of ionic liquid were grafted into the pore channels of SBA&#8208;15 using the post&#8208;grafting method, which allowed the ionic liquid to be grafted into the pore channels restrictively. Notably, over six cycles, SBA&#8722;Mn (0.2) has been shown to maintain its catalytic activity and stability. In addition, a reaction mechanism for the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides based on density&#8208;functional theory is proposed. The cycloaddition reaction of CO2 and epoxides is an efficient way of carbon fixation. It is demonstrated that the metal coordinated with the oxygen atom of the epoxides and that a halogen attacked the carbon of epoxides. Moreover, theoretical calculations and synthesis strategy provide a new approach for CO2 conversion.

         <title>Probing the Structural Dynamics of a Bacterial Chaperone in Its Native Environment by Nitroxide&#8208;Based EPR Spectroscopy</title>

Take a quick look: NarJ protein structural dynamics was investigated by SDSL&#8208;EPR in the complex environment of the cell. In particular, we exploited the sensitivity of nitroxide labels to report protein dynamics at room temperature. Moreover, we demonstrated that such studies can be performed within 15&#8197;minutes, thus preserving both cell integrity and the activity of the protein under investigation.







Abstract
One of the greatest current challenges in structural biology is to study protein dynamics over a wide range of timescales in complex environments, such as the cell. Among magnetic resonances suitable for this approach, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy coupled to site&#8208;directed spin labeling (SDSL&#8208;EPR) has emerged as a promising tool to study protein local dynamics and conformational ensembles. In this work, we exploit the sensitivity of nitroxide labels to report protein local dynamics at room temperature. We demonstrate that such studies can be performed while preserving both the integrity of the cells and the activity of the protein under investigation. Using this approach, we studied the structural dynamics of the chaperone NarJ in its natural host, Escherichia coli. We established that spin&#8208;labeled NarJ is active inside the cell. We showed that the cellular medium affects NarJ structural dynamics in a site&#8208;specific way, while the structural flexibility of the protein is maintained. Finally, we present and discuss data on the time&#8208;resolved dynamics of NarJ in cellular context.

Herein, we present the first polyproline helix to self&#8208;assemble into a reversibly porous, crystalline, supramolecular peptide framework (SPF). Thermal activation, guest&#8208;induced dynamic porosity and enantioselective guest inclusion have been demonstrated for this novel system.







Abstract

Herein, we present the first polyproline helix to self&#8208;assemble into a reversibly porous, crystalline, supramolecular peptide framework (SPF). This framework is assembled from a short oligoproline, adopting the polyproline II conformation, driven by hydrogen&#8208;bonding and dispersion interactions. Thermal activation, guest&#8208;induced dynamic porosity and enantioselective guest inclusion have been demonstrated for this novel system. The principles of the self&#8208;assembly associated with this SPF will be used as a blueprint allowing for the further development of helical peptide linkers in the rational design of SPFs and metal&#8208;peptide frameworks.

         <title>Borate Buffer as a Key Player in Cu&#8208;Based Homogeneous Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 66, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A BO33&#8722; anion from borate buffer provides a structural bridge between low&#8208;cost Cu complexes to form a new in situ trinuclear complex as a fast electrocatalyst for homogeneous water oxidation; likewise, the borate species from the buffer solution at pH&#8197;9 facilitate the high turnover frequency (TOF) by playing a significant role in the O&#8208;O bond formation step.







Abstract
Borate buffer was found to have both structural and functional roles within a low&#8208;cost tri&#8208;copper electrocatalyst for homogeneous water oxidation that exhibits a high turnover frequency of 310&#8197;s&#8722;1. The borate buffer was shown to facilitate the catalytic activity by both bridging the three Cu ions and participating in O&#8722;O bond formation. Phosphate and acetate buffers did not show such roles, making borate a unique player in this catalytic system.

         <title>1,2,5&#8208;Triarylcycloalka[c]arsoles: Structural Effects of Fused&#8208;cycloalkanes on Stability and Photophysical Properties</title>

Cyclopentane&#8208; and cyclohexane&#8208;fused arsoles were also synthesized. While the former was stable, the latter gradually decomposed to the corresponding diketone under ambient conditions owing to its frustrated structure. The frustration of the fused cyclohexane also caused large structural relaxation, resulting in a relatively large Stokes shift.







Abstract
Herein, we have synthesized a variety of cycloalkane&#8208;fused arsoles. Cyclopentane and cyclohexane were incorporated into the cycloalkane&#8208;fused arsoles. Surprisingly, cyclohexane&#8208;fused arsole 2&#8201;a gradually decomposed via oxidative ring&#8208;opening under ambient conditions, while cyclopentane&#8208;fused 1&#8201;a was stable. In addition, the Stokes shift of 2&#8201;a (7766&#8197;cm&#8722;1) is larger than that of 1&#8201;a (5120&#8197;cm&#8722;1). The effects of the fused cycloalkane on the stability and photophysical properties were attributed to the distortion of the cycloalkane. Computational calculations demonstrated that the cyclohexane moiety in 2&#8201;a was frustrated upon being incorporated into the rigid arsole ring, while the cyclopentane moiety in 1&#8201;a was much less distorted.

         <title>Revealing the Effect of Surface Composition on Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes Supported Pt&#8208;Fe Alloy Electrocatalysts for Methanol Oxidation Performance</title>

Electrocatalytic methanol oxidation: This work have been successfully fabricated property Pt&#8722;Fe alloy supported on the MWCNTs featuring nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon via co&#8208;engineering of the surface composition and electronic structure. The resulting structure is a highly active methanol oxidation catalyst.







Abstract
The designs of efficient and inexpensive Pt&#8208;based catalysts for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) are essential to boost the commercialization of direct methanol fuel cells. Here, the highly catalytic performance PtFe alloys supported on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) decorating nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (NC) have been successfully prepared via co&#8208;engineering of the surface composition and electronic structure. The Pt1Fe3@NC/MWCNTs catalyst with moderate Fe3+ feeding content (0.86&#8197;mA/mgPt) exhibits 2.26&#8208;fold enhancement in MOR mass activity compared to pristine Pt/C catalyst (0.38&#8197;mA/mgPt). Furthermore, the CO oxidation initial potential of Pt1Fe3@NC/MWCNTs catalyst is lower relative to Pt/C catalyst (0.71&#8197;V and 0.80&#8197;V). Benefited from the optimal surface compositions, the anti&#8208;corrosion ability of MWCNT, strong electron interaction between PtFe alloys and MWCNTs and the N&#8208;doped carbon (NC) layer, the Pt1Fe3@NC/MWCNTs catalyst presents an improved MOR performance and anti&#8208;CO poisoning ability. This study would open up new perspective for designing efficient electrocatalysts for the DMFCs field.

         <title>Templated Generation of a Bcl&#8208;xL Inhibitor by Isomer&#8208;Free SPAAC Based on Azacyclonon&#8208;5&#8208;yne</title>

Less strain, more gain. We present Fmoc&#8208;ACN as the first cyclononyne suitable for isomer&#8208;free strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (iSPAAC). We demonstrate its use for the rational design and protein&#8208;templated formation of a low&#8208;micromolar inhibitor of protein&#8211;protein interactions mediated by Bcl&#8208;xL. The lower intrinsic reactivity of cyclononynes as compared to cyclooctynes facilitated higher template effects and rate accelerations in the aqueous environment.







Abstract
High&#8208;affinity inhibitors of large protein&#8211;protein interactions often have a high molecular weight, which compromises their cell permeability and oral bioavailability. We recently presented isomer&#8208;free, strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (iSPAAC) as a method by which to generate large, chemically uniform bioactive molecules inside living cells from two smaller components with higher cell permeability. Here, we present the synthesis of Fmoc&#8208;protected azacyclonon&#8208;5&#8208;yne (Fmoc&#8208;ACN) as the first cyclononyne suitable for iSPAAC. ACN facilitated the structure&#8208;guided development of a single&#8208;digit micromolar triazole inhibitor of the protein&#8211;protein interaction domain of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl&#8208;xL. Inhibitor formation in aqueous buffer at 37&#8201;&#176;C, templated by the target protein Bcl&#8208;xL, proceeded 2800 times faster than the reaction between Fmoc&#8208;ACN and benzyl azide under standard conditions in acetonitrile. Our data demonstrate the utility of cyclononynes for iSPAAC and their potential for achieving vastly accelerated templated reactions in aqueous environments.

         <title>Immobilization of AgCl/Pd Heterojunctions on Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon Nanotubes: Interfacial Design&#8208;Induced Electronic Regulation Enhances Photocatalytic Activity</title>

From amine to imine more easily: A fan&#8208;like hollow N&#8208;doped C&#8208;coated AgCl/Pd heterostructure has been synthesized by pyrolysis of a AgCl/Pd@Bim precursor under argon. The interface effect of the AgCl/Pd heterostructure efficiently regulates the electronic structure and accelerates the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers, leading to excellent photocatalytic activity toward oxidative coupling of amine to imine.







Abstract
Rationally designing interface structure to modulate the electronic structure of a photocatalyst is an efficient strategy to facilitate the separation and migration of photogenerated charge carriers and improve photocatalytic activity. In this work, a AgCl/Pd heterostructure encapsulated by N&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes (AgCl/Pd@N&#8722;C) with a fan&#8208;like morphology assembled hollow tubes was synthesized by pyrolysis of a AgCl/Pd@Bim precursor. The unique interface structure not only increases the number of photogenerated charge carriers, but also provides an effective channel for the separation of electrons and holes, which have been proved by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. As expected, the obtained AgCl/Pd&#8208;3@N&#8722;C exhibited greatly enhanced conversion efficiency and recyclability toward the photocatalytic oxidative coupling of amine under blue&#8208;light irradiation.

         <title>Intracellular Assembly of Interacting Enzymes Yields Highly&#8208;Active Nanoparticles for Flow Biocatalysis</title>

All&#8208;enzyme hydrogel nanoparticles of controlled arrangements of interacting enzymes can be produced intracellularly, purified from crude bacterial lysates in a one&#8208;step process, and used as stable materials in flow&#8208;through biocatalysis.







Abstract
All&#8208;enzyme hydrogel (AEH) particles with a hydrodynamic diameter of up to 120&#8197;nm were produced intracellularly with an Escherichia coli&#8208;based in&#8197;vivo system.

&lt;p&gt;All-enzyme hydrogel (AEH) particles with a hydrodynamic diameter of up to 120&#8197;nm were produced intracellularly with an &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;-based in&#8197;vivo system.

         <title>Characterization of a Novel Cytochrome Involved in Geobacter sulfurreducens&#8217; Electron Harvesting Pathways</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 66, November 25, 2022. </description>

The periplasmic cytochrome GSU2515 is crucial for the electron harvesting pathways of Geobacter sulfurreducens, a suitable bacterium to apply in microbial electrosynthesis technologies. The biophysical characterization of GSU2515 together with biomolecular interactions and electron transfer experiments highlighted how electrons are conducted within the periplasm and pave the way for understanding the bacterium's electron harvesting pathways.







Abstract
Electron harvesting bacteria are key targets to develop microbial electrosynthesis technologies, which are valid alternatives for the production of value&#8208;added compounds without utilization of fossil fuels. Geobacter sulfurreducens, that is capable of donating and accepting electrons from electrodes, is one of the most promising electroactive bacteria. Its electron transfer mechanisms to electrodes have been progressively elucidated, however the electron harvesting pathways are still poorly understood. Previous studies showed that the periplasmic cytochromes PccH and GSU2515 are overexpressed in current&#8208;consuming G. sulfurreducens biofilms. PccH was characterized, though no putative partners have been identified. In this work, GSU2515 was characterized by complementary biophysical techniques and in silico simulations using the AlphaFold neural network. GSU2515 is a low&#8208;spin monoheme cytochrome with a disordered N&#8208;terminal region and an &#945;&#8208;helical C&#8208;terminal domain harboring the heme group. The cytochrome undergoes a redox&#8208;linked heme axial ligand switch, with Met91 and His94 as distal axial ligands in the reduced and oxidized states, respectively. The reduction potential of the cytochrome is negative and modulated by the pH in the physiological range: &#8722;78&#8197;mV at pH&#8197;6 and &#8722;113&#8197;mV at pH&#8197;7. Such pH&#8208;dependence coupled to the redox&#8208;linked switch of the axial ligand allows the cytochrome to drive a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer step that is crucial to confer directionality to the respiratory chain. Biomolecular interactions and electron transfer experiments indicated that GSU2515 and PccH form a redox complex. Overall, the data obtained highlight for the first time how periplasmic proteins bridge the electron transfer between the outer and inner membrane in the electron harvesting pathways of G. sulfurreducens.

         <title>Solution Structure of a Lanthanide&#8208;binding DNA Aptamer Determined Using High Quality pseudocontact shift restraints</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 66, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;range paramagnetic NMR restraints remain largely inaccessible for nucleic acid systems. In this contribution we demonstrate that such restraints can be generated by a lanthanide ion bound to an intrinsic site provided by a DNA aptamer. By solving the 3D structure of the aptamer&#8208;Ln3+ complex we provide the structural basis for the introduction of similar sites into other DNA systems.







Abstract
In this contribution we report the high&#8208;resolution NMR structure of a recently identified lanthanide&#8208;binding aptamer (LnA). We demonstrate that the rigid lanthanide binding by LnA allows for the measurement of anisotropic paramagnetic NMR restraints which to date remain largely inaccessible for nucleic acids. One type of such restraints &#8208; pseudocontact shifts (PCS) induced by four different paramagnetic lanthanides &#8208; was extensively used throughout the current structure determination study and the measured PCS turned out to be exceptionally well reproduced by the final aptamer structure. This finding opens the perspective for a broader application of paramagnetic effects in NMR studies of nucleic acids through the transplantation of the binding site found in LnA into other DNA/RNA systems.

         <title>Ultrathin Niobate Nanosheet Assembly with Au NPs and CdS QDs as a Highly Efficient Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 66, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An excellent 2D photocatalyst was synthesized by loading Au nanoparticles and CdS quantum dots on niobate nanosheets. This CdS/Au/HNb3O8 photocatalyst not only increased the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate by 254 times compared with the pure niobate nanosheet, but also showed outstanding photocatalytic performance for oxidative self&#8208;coupling of benzylamine and degradation of organic dyes.







Abstract
Niobate nanosheets have aroused widespread interest in recent years for their prospects in catalysis. The exploration of 2D niobate catalysis with stable and efficient properties is still the focus in chemistry and materials science. Herein, the successful fabrication of 2D CdS/Au/HNb3O8 catalyst is demonstrated which revealed efficient photocatalytic properties in H2 evolution, oxidative self&#8208;coupling of amines to imines, and degradation of dyes. Especially the assembled architecture can give a rate of 5.85&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 of photocatalytic H2 evolution, an &#8764;254&#8208;fold enhancement, compared with bare HNb3O8 nanosheets under identical conditions. In accordance with density functional theory (DFT) and X&#8208;ray adsorption fine structure (XAFS) analyses, the vast improvements are benefited from efficient migration and separation of charge carriers. Besides, the surface plasma resonance (SPR) effect of Au NPs enhances the light harvesting capacity and boosts the generation of hot electrons, efficiently improving the visible&#8208;light absorption.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Tailoring To Construct Ultrathin Bi2O2O/Bi2O2(OH)(NO3) Nanosheets: Interactive CO2RR Promotion and Bismuth&#8208;Oxygen Moiety Preservation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 66, November 25, 2022. </description>

Special morphology: Ultrathin Bi2O2O surface/Bi2O2(OH)(NO3) substrate nanosheets were prepared through in&#8208;situ interlamellar hydrogen&#8208;bond tailoring strategies. The special morphology not only helps to facilitate production of the Bi2O2CO3 intermediate, but also enhances the resistance of Bi&#8722;O moieties to being reduced to promote formate production from CO2RR.







Abstract
Bismuth&#8211;oxygen moieties are beneficial for high&#8208;efficiency electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RR) to produce formate; however, preserving bismuth&#8208;oxygen moieties while applying a cathodic potential is challenging. This work reports the preparation of ultrathin Bi2O2O/Bi2O2(OH)(NO3) nanosheets (BiON&#8208;uts) by in&#8208;situ tailoring of hydrogen bonds in a Bi2O2(OH)(NO3) precursor. The BiON&#8208;uts exhibits a formate faradaic efficiency of 98&#8201;% with higher partial current density than that of most reported bismuth&#8208;based catalysts. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that the ultrathin nanosheet morphology facilitates ion&#8208;exchange between BiON&#8208;uts and the electrolyte to produce Bi2O2CO3 as intermediate, and adsorption of CO2 with surface Bi2O2O. DFT calculations reveal that the rate&#8208;limiting first electron transfer is effectively improved by the high electron affinity of Bi2O2CO3. More importantly, high&#8208;efficiency CO2RR in turn protects the bismuth&#8211;oxygen moieties from being reduced and thus helps to maintain the excellent CO2RR activity. This work offers an interactive mechanism of CO2RR promotion and bismuth&#8211;oxygen moiety preservation, opening up new opportunities for developing high&#8208;performance catalysts.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bismuth&#8211;oxygen moieties are beneficial for high-efficiency electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) to produce formate; however, preserving bismuth-oxygen moieties while applying a cathodic potential is challenging. This work reports the preparation of ultrathin Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) nanosheets (BiON-uts) by in-situ tailoring of hydrogen bonds in a Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) precursor. The BiON-uts exhibits a formate faradaic efficiency of 98&#8201;% with higher partial current density than that of most reported bismuth-based catalysts. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that the ultrathin nanosheet morphology facilitates ion-exchange between BiON-uts and the electrolyte to produce Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as intermediate, and adsorption of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with surface Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. DFT calculations reveal that the rate-limiting first electron transfer is effectively improved by the high electron affinity of Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. More importantly, high-efficiency CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR in turn protects the bismuth&#8211;oxygen moieties from being reduced and thus helps to maintain the excellent CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR activity. This work offers an interactive mechanism of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR promotion and bismuth&#8211;oxygen moiety preservation, opening up new opportunities for developing high-performance catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Extremely Stable Interprotein Tetrahedral Hg(Cys)4 Core Forms in the Zinc Hook Domain of Rad50 Protein at Physiological pH</title>

HgII toxicity: HgII targets the intermolecular ZnII&#8208;binding site of DNA binding protein Rad50 to form the strongest metal complex in the living world and jeopardize the DNA repair mechanism.







Abstract
In nature, thiolate&#8208;based systems are the primary targets of divalent mercury (HgII) toxicity. The formation of Hg(Cys)x cores in catalytic and structural protein centers mediates mercury's toxic effects and ultimately leads to cellular damage. Multiple studies have revealed distinct HgII&#8208;thiolate coordination preferences, among which linear HgII complexes are the most commonly observed in solution at physiological pH. Trigonal or tetrahedral geometries are formed at basic pH or in tight intraprotein Cys&#8208;rich metal sites. So far, no interprotein tetrahedral HgII complex formed at neutral pH has been reported. Rad50 protein is a part of the multiprotein MRN complex, a major player in DNA damage&#8208;repair processes. Its central region consists of a conserved CXXC motif that enables dimerization of two Rad50 molecules by coordinating ZnII. Dimerized motifs form a unique interprotein zinc hook domain (Hk) that is critical for the biological activity of the MRN. Using a series of length&#8208;differentiated peptide models of the Pyrococcus furiosus zinc hook domain, we investigated its interaction with HgII. Using UV&#8208;Vis, CD, PAC, and 199Hg&#8197;NMR spectroscopies as well as anisotropy decay, we discovered that all Rad50 fragments preferentially form homodimeric Hg(Hk)2 species with a distorted tetrahedral HgS4 coordination environment at physiological pH; this is the first example of an interprotein mercury site displaying tetrahedral geometry in solution. At higher HgII content, monomeric HgHk complexes with linear geometry are formed. The Hg(Cys)4 core of Rad50 is extremely stable and does not compete with cyanides, NAC, or DTT. Applying ITC, we found that the stability constant of the Rad50 Hg(Hk)2 complex is approximately three orders of magnitude higher than those of the strongest HgII complexes known to date.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Oxidizing Ruthenium(II) Complexes with Enhanced Visible&#8208;Light Absorption and G&#8208;quadruplex DNA Binding Abilities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 66, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru(II) complexes that gather strong photo&#8208;oxidizing power and enhanced visible&#8208;light absorption were prepared with the highly conjugated dph or bpph ligands. Biolayer interferometry and NCI Surface analyses show their avid binding to G&#8208;quadruplex DNA particularly arising from interaction within the G&#8208;quadruplex groove.







Abstract
Photosensitizers that gather high photo&#8208;oxidizing power and strong visible&#8208;light absorption are of great interest in the development of new photo&#8208;chemotherapeutics. Indeed, such compounds constitute attractive candidates for the design of type I photosensitizers that are not dependent on the presence of oxygen. In this paper, we report on the synthesis and studies of new ruthenium(II) complexes that display strong visible&#8208;light absorption and can oxidize guanine residues under visible&#8208;light irradiation, as evidenced by nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. The reported compounds also tightly bind to G&#8208;quadruplex DNA structures from the human telomeric sequence (TTAGGG repeat). The kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of the interaction of these Ru(II) complexes with G&#8208;quadruplex and duplex DNA were studied thanks to luminescence titrations and bio&#8208;layer interferometry measurements, which revealed higher affinities towards the non&#8208;canonical G&#8208;quadruplex architecture. Docking experiments and non&#8208;covalent ionic analysis allowed us to gain information on the mode and the strength of the interaction of the compounds towards G&#8208;quadruplex and duplex DNA. The different studies emphasize the substantial influence of the position and the number of non&#8208;chelating nitrogen atoms on the interaction with both types of DNA secondary structures.

Through the electrogeneration of boryl and silyl radical a panel of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl or &#945;&#8208;difluoromethylstyrenes was converted into the corresponding allyl silanes and boronates in good to excellent yields (64&#8197;examples, from 31&#8201;% to 95&#8201;% yield).

Abstract
The electrochemical synthesis of fluorinated allyl silanes and boronates was disclosed. The addition of electrogenerated boryl or silyl radicals onto many &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl or &#945;&#8208;difluoromethylstyrenes in an undivided cell allowed the formation of a large panel of synthetically useful gem&#8208;difluoro and &#947;&#8208;fluoroallyl boronates and silanes (64&#8197;examples, from 31&#8201;% to 95&#8201;% yield). In addition, a scale up of the reactions under continuous flow was showcased using an electrochemical reactor with promising volumetric productivity (688&#8197;g.L&#8722;1.h&#8722;1 and 496&#8197;g.L&#8722;1.h&#8722;1). Moreover, the synthetic utility of these building blocks was highlighted through versatile transformations. Finally, plausible reaction mechanisms were suggested to explain the formation of the products.

         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional materials have been studied for nearly two decades and are widely used in the field of photocatalytic CO2 reduction due to their excellent physicochemical properties. This review categorizes and presents selected 2D materials using a taxonomy of top&#8208;down and bottom&#8208;up strategies. We highlight some work that has the potential for batch preparation and summarize the prospects and challenges of batch fabrication of 2D materials.

&lt;p&gt;Two-dimensional materials have been studied for nearly two decades and are widely used in the field of photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction due to their excellent physicochemical properties. This review categorizes and presents selected 2D materials using a taxonomy of top-down and bottom-up strategies. We highlight some work that has the potential for batch preparation and summarize the prospects and challenges of batch fabrication of 2D materials. For more details, see the Review by Kai Li, Yuanzhen Zhou, Wenlei Zhu, et&#8197;al. (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202201881"&gt;10.1002/chem.202201881&lt;/a&gt;)

         <title>Frontispiece: Recent Advances in the Research of Photo&#8208;Assisted Lithium&#8208;Based Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 66, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;assisted lithium&#8208;based batteries (PALBs) can directly store solar energy or output for circuit load by converting into electric energy without any intermediate. The photogenerated electrons and holes can promote the reduction and oxidation reaction in PALBs under light illumination, which will greatly reduce the overpotential in charge and discharge process. These PALBs which will provide a more competitive strategy for the full use of solar energy are discussed in the Review by Ye, He, Meng, Wang and colleagues (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202104).

         <title>Frontispiece: Fast Cysteine Bioconjugation Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 66, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this contribution, we attempt to define fast cysteine bioconjugation, in contrast to the traditional cysteine modifying reactions that are kinetically slow. A fast cysteine conjugation reaction can allow facile quantitative labeling of proteins with minimized side reactions and much simplified purification. A substantial collection of novel reactions have been developed towards this end with some displaying reaction rates over 103&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. This Concept article discusses the design principles and reaction mechanisms, with reaction rate constants summarized to provide valuable reference data for further development of fast and highly efficient protein conjugation reactions. More information can be found in the Concept article by J. Gao and F.&#8208;J. Chen. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201843)

         <title>Front Cover: An Extremely Stable Interprotein Tetrahedral Hg(Cys)4 Core Forms in the Zinc Hook Domain of Rad50 Protein at Physiological pH (Chem. Eur. J. 66/2022)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 66, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
HgII interacting with a naturally ZnII&#8208;containing Rad50 protein interface yields HgS4 species, the strongest metal&#8211;protein interaction known to date. It also introduces the novel manifestation of HgII mechanism of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Furthermore, the substitution of naturally occurring ZnII possibly has an impact on the quaternary structure and the protein assembly process, thus disrupting the DNA&#8208;repair mechanisms that engage the Mre11&#8211;Rad50 complex. More information can be found in the Research Article by A.&#8197;Kr&#281;&#380;el and co&#8208;workers. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202738).

Messages from the cell: The cover picture honors the sensitivity of nitroxide labels combined with EPR spectroscopy in reporting on protein structure dynamics inside bacterial cells. We have demonstrated, in particular, that NarJ protein can be investigated at room temperature within 15&#8197;minutes, conditions that allow the preservation of both cell integrity and the activity of the protein under investigation. More information can be found in the Research Article by E. Mileo and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202249).

         <title>Cover Feature: Continuous Charge Transport in Carbon Nitride Modulated by Interfacial Chemical Bond and Homophase Junction to Boost Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production (Chem. Eur. J. 66/2022)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 66, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Motivated by the electron transport chain in natural photosynthesis, we propose a strategy to construct an electron transport channel in a model artificial photocatalyst, C3N4&#8722;TiO2 (BN&#8722;BR/CN) by electron transport layer engineering through a homophase junction (BN&#8722;BR). The electrons generated in CN under visible light can be contiunuously extracted and migrated along CN,BR TiO2, and BN TiO2, resulting in the synergistic optimization of photoabsorption and charge separation, and boosting H2 evolution. More information can be found in the Research Article by J. Zhang and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202007).

Photo&#8208;assisted lithium&#8208;based batteries (PALBs) are widely attracting researchers because they can directly convert solar energy into electric energy for storage or output without any intermediate. Highly active photogenerated carriers can enhance the battery reaction and reduce the overpotential in charge and discharge process to increase the energy efficiency. The development of various PALBs is discussed under the aspects of configuration, mechanism, electrodes design and performance.







Abstract
The application of solar energy is crucial for alleviating the energy crisis and achieving sustainable development. In recent years, photo&#8208;assisted rechargeable batteries have attracted researchers because they can directly convert and store solar energy in the batteries. And it also can be used like a normal battery without light illumination. Photo&#8208;assisted lithium&#8208;based batteries have received more attention than other energy storage systems due to their higher energy density and relatively mature development. This Review focuses on the design of various photo&#8208;assisted lithium&#8208;based batteries including Li&#8208;ion, Li&#8208;S, Li&#8208;O2, Li&#8208;CO2 and Li&#8208;I batteries, as well as the working mechanism of photoelectrodes in these battery systems. The basic understanding and challenge of photo&#8208;assisted lithium&#8208;based batteries are also discussed. At last, perspectives for the photoelectrode development are provided in the summary to advance photo&#8208;assisted energy storage systems.

A 2D view of photocatalysis: This review discusses 2D materials with excellent performance in photocatalytic CO2 reduction, summarizes existing synthetic strategies, and highlights promising batch preparation strategies. Second, our work summarizes the existing applications and modification strategies of various 2D materials in the field of CO2 emission reduction.







Abstract
Currently, the excessive consumption of fossil fuels is accompanied by massive emissions of CO2, leading to severe energy shortages and intensified global warming. It is of great significance to develop and use renewable clean energy while reducing the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. Photocatalytic technology is a promising strategy for carbon dioxide conversion. Clearly, the achievement of the above goals largely depends on the design and construction of catalysts. This review is mainly focused on the application of 2D materials for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The contribution of synthetic strategies to their structure and performance is emphasized. Finally, the current challenges, and prospects of 2D materials for photoreduction of CO2 with high efficiency, even for practical applications are discussed. It is hoped that this review can provide some guidance for the rational design, controllable synthesis of 2D materials, and their application for efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction.

         <title>Fluorescent Nanoassemblies in Water Exhibiting Tunable LCST Behavior and Responsive Light Harvesting Ability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Responsive fluorescent nanomaterials have been received considerable attention in recent years. In this work, we synthesized a bola&#8208;type amphiphilic molecule CSO, which contains a hydrophobic cyanostilbene core and hydrophilic oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) coils at both sides. The cyanostilbene group is aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) active, while the OEG coils are thermo&#8208;responsive. As a result, the CSO molecules can self&#8208;assemble into blue&#8208;fluorescent nanoassemblies with lower critical solution temperature (LCST) behavior in aqueous media. It is noteworthy that the LCST behavior can be reversibly regulated with changes in concentration and the introduction of K+. Intriguingly, fluorescence of CSO assembly shows a blue&#8208;shift upon heating. Finally, by employing CSO as a light capturing antenna and energy donor, an artificial light harvesting system with tunable emission and thermo&#8208;responsive characteristics was fabricated. Our study not only demonstrates an integrated approach to create responsive fluorescent nanomaterials, but also shows great potential for producing luminescent materials and mimicking light harvesting in nature.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Coupling of Chlorosilanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organosilanes play essential roles in many important research areas. The use of readily available chlorosilanes to catalytically access these compounds is synthetically appealing but remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling reaction has recently emerged as a promising protocol to arrive at this goal. This strategy allows the chlorosilanes to be coupled with various carbon electrophiles under mild conditions. These reactions afford organosilanes with improved molecular diversity, structural complexity, and functional group compatibility. This concept manuscript summarizes the recent advance on nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive C&#8211;Si couplings of chlorosilanes.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Electrochemical Synthesis of 2,3&#8208;Disubstituted Quinoline N&#8208;oxides by Cathodic Reduction of Nitro Arenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of electric current in synthetic organic chemistry offers a sustainable tool for the selective reductive synthesis of quinoline N&#8208;oxides starting from easily accessible nitro compounds. The reported method employs mild and reagent&#8208;free conditions, a simple undivided cell, and constant current electrolysis set&#8208;up which provides conversion with a high atom economy. The synthesis of 29 differently substituted quinoline N&#8208;oxides was successfully performed in up to 90% yield. Using CV studies, the mechanism of the selective formation of the quinoline N&#8208;oxides was elucidated. The technical relevance of the described reaction could be shown in a 50&#8208;fold scale&#8208;up reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>TEMPO&#8208;Modified Polymethacrylates as Mediators in Electrosynthesis &#8208; Influence of the Molecular Weight on Redox Properties and Electrocatalytic Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Homogeneous catalysts (&#8220;mediators&#8221;) are frequently employed in organic electrosynthesis to control selectivity. Despite their advantages, they can have a negative influence on the overall energy and mass balance if used only once or recycled inefficiently. Polymediators are soluble redox&#8208;active polymers applicable as electrocatalysts, enabling recovery by dialysis or membrane filtration. Using anodic alcohol oxidation as an example, we have demonstrated that TEMPO&#8208;modified polymethacrylates (TPMA) can act as efficient and recyclable catalysts. In the present work, the influence of the molecular size on the redox properties and the catalytic activity was carefully elaborated using a series of TPMAs with well&#8208;defined molecular weight distributions. Cyclic voltammetry studies show that the polymer chain length has a pronounced impact on the key&#8208;properties. Together with preparative&#8208;scale electrolysis experiments, an optimum size range was identified for polymediator&#8208;guided sustainable reaction control.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidative Desymmetrization Enables the Concise Synthesis of a trans&#8208;Cyclooctene Linker for Bioorthogonal Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioorthogonal cleavage of trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) linkers triggered by a click reaction with tetrazines has enabled new concepts in chemical biology and in vivo chemistry. We introduce a new dioxolane&#8208;fused cleavable TCO linker (dcTCO) with high stability and reduced lipophilicity that can be prepared in five steps and demonstrate its application in bioorthogonal prodrug activation, achieving a remarkable &gt;1000&#8208;fold &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; in cytotoxicity.







Abstract
Modified trans&#8208;cyclooctenes (TCO) are capable of highly efficient molecular manipulations in biological environments, driven by the bioorthogonal reaction with tetrazines (Tz). The development of click&#8208;cleavable TCO has fueled the field of in&#8197;vivo chemistry and enabled the design of therapeutic strategies that have already started to enter the clinic. A key element for most of these approaches is the implementation of a cleavable TCO linker. So far, only one member of this class has been developed, a compound that requires a high synthetic effort, mainly to fulfill the multilayered demands on its chemical structure. To tackle this limitation, we developed a dioxolane&#8208;fused cleavable TCO linker (dcTCO) that can be prepared in only five steps by applying an oxidative desymmetrization to achieve diastereoselective introduction of the required functionalities. Based on investigation of the structure, reaction kinetics, stability, and hydrophilicity of dcTCO, we demonstrate its bioorthogonal application in the design of a caged prodrug that can be activated by in&#8208;situ Tz&#8208;triggered cleavage to achieve a remarkable &gt;1000&#8208;fold increase in cytotoxicity.

         <title>Surface Modification, Topographic Design and Applications of Superhydrophobic Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superhydrophobic surfaces with expanded wetting behaviors like tunable adhesion, hybrid surface hydrophobicity and smart hydrophobic switching, have attracted increasing attention due to their broad applications. This review mainly focuses on recent advances in surface modification, topographic design and the application of superhydrophobic systems.







Abstract
Superhydrophobic surfaces with expanded wetting behaviors, like tunable adhesion, hybrid surface hydrophobicity and smart hydrophobic switching have attracted increasing attention due to their broad applications. Herein, the construction methods, mechanisms and advanced applications of special superhydrophobicity are reviewed, and hydro/superhydrophobic modifications are categorized and discussed based on their surface chemistry, and topographic design. The formation and maintenance of special superhydrophobicity in the metastable state are also examined and explored. In addition, particular attention is paid to the use of special wettability in various applications, such as membrane distillation, droplet&#8208;based electricity generators and anti&#8208;fogging surfaces. Finally, the challenges for practical applications and future research directions are discussed.

         <title>Efficient Synthesis of Diaryl Quaternary Centers by Rh(II)/Xantphos Catalyzed Relay C&#8722;H Functionalization and Allylic Alkylation</title>

         <dc:description>
A dirhodium(II)/Xantphos catalyzed three&#8208;component reaction of N, N&#8208;disubstituted anilines, &#945;&#8208;diazo esters, and allylic compounds was developed, affording various aniline derivatives with diaryl allylic quaternary centers in good yields under mild conditions. The reaction proceeds via para C(sp2)&#8722;H functionalization of aniline derivatives by Rh(II)&#8208;carbenoid intermediate, and subsequent [Rh2]/Xantphos&#8208;catalyzed allylic alkylation of the resulting &#945;, &#945;&#8208;diarylacetate intermediate.







Abstract
A three&#8208;component reaction of N, N&#8208;disubstituted aniline, &#945;&#8208;diazo ester, and an allylic electrophile has been realized by [Rh(II)]2/Xantphos catalysis, providing a direct access to various aniline derivatives bearing diaryl allylic quaternary centers in good yields. The synthetic utility of this protocol was demonstrated by facile derivatization of the products for preparation of biologically relevant molecules and structural scaffolds, which offers a high potential for increasing the molecular diversity. Mechanistic studies identified &#945;, &#945;&#8208;diarylacetate species as an active intermediate, thereby revealing the presence of a C(sp2)&#8722;H functionalization of aniline derivatives/allylic alkylation cascade in this attractive catalytic transformation.

         <title>Rational Design and Synthesis of D&#8208;galactosyl Lysophospholipids as Selective Substrates and non&#8208;ATP&#8208;competitive Inhibitors of Phosphatidylinositol Phosphate Kinases</title>

New&#8208;to&#8208;Nature D&#8208;galactosyl lysophospholipids were rationally designed and synthesized to act as artificial substrates and non&#8208;ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases, which are validated drug targets for deadly human diseases including cancers, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and SARS&#8208;COVID&#8208;2 infection. Rational Design and Synthesis of D&#8208;galactosyl Lysophospholipids as Selective Substrates and non&#8208;ATP&#8208;competitive Inhibitors of Phosphatidylinositol Phosphate Kinases (X. Huang, J. Hu et&#8197;al.)







Abstract
Phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases (PIPKs) produce lipid signaling molecules and have been attracting increasing attention as drug targets for cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and viral infection. Given the potential cross&#8208;inhibition of kinases and other ATP&#8208;utilizing enzymes by ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors, targeting the unique lipid substrate binding site represents a superior strategy for PIPK inhibition. Here, by taking advantage of the nearly identical stereochemistry between myo&#8208;inositol and D&#8208;galactose, we designed and synthesized a panel of D&#8208;galactosyl lysophospholipids, one of which was found to be a selective substrate of phosphatidylinositol 4&#8208;phosphate 5&#8208;kinase. Derivatization of this compound led to the discovery of a human PIKfyve inhibitor with an apparent IC50 of 6.2&#8197;&#956;M, which significantly potentiated the inhibitory effect of Apilimod, an ATP&#8208;competitive PIKfyve inhibitor under clinical trials against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Our results provide the proof of concept that D&#8208;galactose&#8208;based phosphoinositide mimetics can be developed into artificial substrates and new inhibitors of PIPKs.

         <title>Size Selectivity in Heterolanthanide Molecular Complexes with a Ditopic Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A size selectivity in the coordination of different lanthanides ions to the two donor sites of the ditopic pyterpyNO ligand has been evidenced in heteronuclear complexes of formula RE2RE*2(tta)12(pyterpyNO)2, where smaller (larger) ions normally display a higher affinity for the eight (nine)&#8208;coordinated oxygen (nitrogen) site. The present results, obtained in solution and in the solid state with a multi&#8208;technique approach (X&#8208;ray diffraction, 19F&#8197;NMR, magnetometry and photoluminescence), are independent of the employed synthetic route.







Abstract
The similar reactivity of lanthanides generally leads to statistically populated polynuclear complexes, making the rational design of ordered hetero&#8208;lanthanide compounds extremely challenging. Here we report on the site selectivity in hetero&#8208;lanthanide tetranuclear complexes afforded by the relatively simple ditopic pyterpyNO ligand (4&#8217;&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridil)&#8208;2,2&#8217;:6&#8217;,2&#8221;&#8208;terpyridine N&#8208;oxide). The sequential room temperature reaction of RE2(tta)6(pyterpyNO)2 (where RE=Y, (1); Eu, (2), Dy, (3) Htta=2&#8208;thenoyltrifluoroacetone) with La(tta)3dme (dme=dimethoxyethane) yielded Y2La2(tta)12(pyterpyNO)2 (4), Dy2La2(tta)12(pyterpyNO)2 (5) and Eu2La2(tta)12(pyterpyNO)2 (6). Single crystals X&#8208;ray diffraction studies showed that 4, 5 and 6 are isostructural, featuring a tetranuclear structure with two different metal coordination sites with coordination numbers 8 (CN8) and 9 (CN9). The two smaller cations are mainly bridged by the O&#8208;donor atoms of the NO groups of two pyterpyNO ligands (CN8), while the larger lanthanum centres are bound by a terpyridine unit (CN9). Size selectivity has been studied with structural and magnetic studies in the solid state and through 19F&#8197;NMR and photoluminescence studies in solution, showing a direct dependence on the difference of ionic radii of the ions and yielding a 91&#8201;% selectivity for 4. Furthermore, 19F&#8197;NMR, X&#8208;ray and PL studies pointed out that the nature of the product is independent from the synthetic route for compound Eu2Y2(tta)12(pyterpyNO)2 (7), keeping the ion selectivity also for a self&#8208;assembly reaction. Unexpectedly, these studies have evidenced that selectivity is not exclusively governed by electrostatic interactions related to size dimensions.

         <title>Activation of Ge&#8722;H and Sn&#8722;H Bonds with N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes and a Cyclic (Alkyl)(amino)carbene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Insertion of cAACMe into E&#8722;H bonds of EH2R2 (E=Ge, R=Mes; E=Sn, R=Me) to yield cAACMeH&#8722;EHR2 and the dehydrogenative coupling of EH2R2 using N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes are reported.







Abstract
A study of the reactivity of several N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) and the cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene 1&#8208;(2,6&#8208;di&#8208;iso&#8208;propylphenyl)&#8208;3,3,5,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;pyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (cAACMe) with the group 14 hydrides GeH2Mes2 and SnH2Me2 (Me=CH3, Mes=1,3,5&#8208;(CH3)3C6H2) is presented. The reaction of GeH2Mes2 with cAACMe led to the insertion of cAACMe into one Ge&#8722;H bond to give cAACMeH&#8722;GeHMes2 (1). If 1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (Me2ImMe) was used as the carbene, NHC&#8208;mediated dehydrogenative coupling occurred, which led to the NHC&#8208;stabilized germylene Me2ImMe&#8901;GeMes2 (2). The reaction of SnH2Me2 with cAACMe also afforded the insertion product cAACMeH&#8722;SnHMe2 (3), and reaction of two equivalents Me2ImMe with SnH2Me2 gave the NHC&#8208;stabilized stannylene Me2ImMe&#8901;SnMe2 (4). If the sterically more demanding NHCs Me2ImMe, 1,3&#8208;di&#8208;isopropyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (iPr2ImMe) and 1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;(2,6&#8208;di&#8208;isopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (Dipp2Im) were employed, selective formation of cyclic oligomers (SnMe2)n (5; n=5&#8211;8) in high yield was observed. These cyclic oligomers were also obtained from the controlled decomposition of cAACMeH&#8722;SnHMe2 (3).

         <title>Orthogonal Crosslinking: A Strategy to Generate Novel Protein Topology and Function</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intrigued by diverse non&#8208;disulfide crosslinks occurring naturally in bacterial adhesins and pili domains, scientists have endeavored to expand crosslinker structures by using a variety of approaches and transpose this unusual topology to other robust protein scaffolds such as domain antibodies. This Concept summarizes recent advances in this fertile intersection of organic chemistry, biochemistry, and protein science.







Abstract
Compared to the disulfide bond, other naturally occurring intramolecular crosslinks have received little attention, presumably due to their rarity in the vast protein space. Here we presented examples of natural non&#8208;disulfide crosslinks, which we refer to as orthogonal crosslinks, emphasizing their effect on protein topology and function. We summarize recent efforts on expanding orthogonal crosslinks by using either the enzymes that catalyze protein circularization or the genetic code expansion strategy to add electrophilic amino acids site&#8208;specifically in proteins. The advantages and disadvantages of each method are discussed, along with their applications to generate novel protein topology and function. In particular, we highlight our recent work on spontaneous orthogonal crosslinking, in which a carbamate&#8208;based crosslink was generated in&#8197;situ, and its applications in designing orthogonally crosslinked domain antibodies with their topology&#8208;mimicking bacterial adhesins.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Mediated Deoxygenative Radical Additions of Aromatic Acids to Vinyl Boronic Esters and gem&#8208;Diborylalkenes
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoredox&#8208;mediate deoxygenation: In this work, we explore an efficient, general photoredox&#8208;mediated deoxygenated approach of abundant, simple, and commercially available carboxylic acids and vinyl boronic esters, which form the important &#946;&#8208;keto&#8208;borylalkanes. Additionally, a protocol of the late&#8208;stage functionalization of naturally occurring bioactive carboxylic acids and drugs has been developed using this approach.







Abstract
A new method to access &#946;&#8208;keto&#8208;gem&#8208;diborylalkanes, by direct deoxygenative radical addition of aromatic carboxylic acids to gem&#8208;dibortlalkenes, is described. The reaction proceeds under mild photoredox catalysis and involves the photochemical C&#8722;O bond activation of aromatic carboxylic acids in the presence of PPh3. It generates an acyl radical, which further undergoes an additional reaction with gem&#8208;diborylalkenes to form an &#945;&#8208;gem&#8208;diboryl alkyl radical intermediate, which then reduces to the corresponding anion, which after protonation, affords the &#946;&#8208;keto&#8208;gem&#8208;diborylalkane product. Moreover, the same scenario has been extended to the vinyl boronic esters, for example, gem&#8208;(Ar, Bpin)&#8208;alkenes, and gem&#8208;(Alkyl, Bpin)&#8208;alkenes. Importantly, this protocol provides a general platform for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of bio&#8208;active and drug molecules containing a carboxylic acid group.

It generates an acyl radical, which further undergoes an additional reaction with &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-diborylalkenes to form an &#945;-&lt;i&gt;gem-&lt;/i&gt;diboryl alkyl radical intermediate, which then reduces to the corresponding anion, which after protonation, affords the &#946;-keto-&lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-diborylalkane product. Moreover, the same scenario has been extended to the vinyl boronic esters, for example, &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-(Ar, Bpin)-alkenes, and &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-(Alkyl, Bpin)-alkenes. Importantly, this protocol provides a general platform for the late-stage functionalization of bio-active and drug molecules containing a carboxylic acid group.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Crystal Plane&#8208;Related Oxygen Evolution Activity of Single Hexagonal Co3O4 Spinel Particles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reac&#173;tion in alkaline electrolyte of hexagonal spinel Co3O4 nanoparticles derived using scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) is correlated with scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy images of the droplet landing sites. A unique way to deconvolute the intrinsic catalytic activity of individual crystal facets of the hexagonal Co3O4 spinel particle is demonstrated in terms of the turnover frequency (TOF) of surface Co atoms. The top surface expo&#173;sing 111 crystal planes displayed a thickness&#8208;dependent TOF with a TOF of about 100 s&#8208;1 at a potential of 1.8 V vs RHE and a particle thickness of 100 nm. The edge of the particle exposing (110) planes, however, showed an average TOF of 270 &#177; 68 s&#8208;1 at 1.8 V vs RHE and no correlation with particle thickness. However, the higher atomic density of Co atoms on the edge surface (2.5 times of the top) renders the overall catalytic activity of the edge planes significantly higher than that of the top planes. The use of a free&#8208;diffusing Os&#8208; complex in the alkaline electrolyte revealed the low electrical conductivity through individual particles which explains the thickness&#8208;dependent TOF of the top planes and could be a reason for the low activity of the top (111) planes.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Formation of Stable Neutral Radicals and Cations from [22]Smaragdyrin BF2 Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>meso&#8208;Trimesityl&#8208;substituted [20]smaragdyrin 6 was synthesized by p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid&#8208;catalyzed reaction of 5&#8208;mesityldipyrromethane and 2,14&#8208;dibromodipyrrin in an improved yield of 63%. Unexpectedly, treatment of 6 with BF3&#183;OEt2 and triethylamine (TEA) gave stable radical 14, in which the BF2 unit is coordinated at the tripyrrin site, probably by ready release of hydrogen atom of [22]smaragdyrin BF2 complex 17. Similar treatment of [22]smaragdyrin free base 4 produced 3. Neutral radical 14 was oxidized with AgSbF6 to stable antiaromatic cation 15 and was reduced with NaBH4 to 17, which was easily oxidized back to 14 in the air and rearranged to thermodynamically stable complex 3 upon treatment with BF3&#183;OEt2 and TEA. Further, the BF2 complex 3 was similarly oxidized to stable neutral radical 18 and stable cation 19 in a stepwise manner. This work demonstrates a rare ability of smaragdyrin BF2 complexes to exist as multiple redox states, particularly forming a stable neutral radical by facile release of a hydrogen atom.</dc:description>

         <title>C&#8208;Terminal Lipidation of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Fusion Peptide Reinstates Superior Membrane Fusion Catalytic Ability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome&#8208;associated coronavirus&#8208;2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) mediates a critical stage in infection, the fusion between viral and host membranes. The protein is categorized as a class I viral fusion protein and has two distinct cleavage sites that can be activated by proteases. The activation deploys the fusion peptide (FP) for insertion into the target cell membranes. Recent studies including our experiments showed that the FP was unable to modulate the kinetics of fusion at a low peptide&#8208;to&#8208;lipid ratio akin to the spike density at the viral surface. Therefore, we have modified the C&#8208;terminus of FP and attached a myristoyl chain (C&#8208;myr&#8208;FP) to restrict the C&#8208;terminus near to interface, bridge both membranes, and increase the effective local concentration. The lipidated FP (C&#8208;myr&#8208;FP) of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 greatly accelerates membrane fusion at a low peptide&#8208;to&#8208;lipid ratio as compared to the FP with no lipidation. Biophysical experiments suggest that C&#8208;myr&#8208;FP adopts a helical structure, perturbs the membrane interface, and increases water penetration to catalyze fusion. Scrambled peptide (C&#8208;myr&#8208;sFP) and truncated peptide (C&#8208;myr&#8208;8FP) couldn&#8217;t significantly catalyze the fusion suggesting the important role of myristoylation and the N&#8208;terminus. C&#8208;myr&#8208;FP enhances the murine coronavirus infection by promoting syncytia formation in L2 cells. The C&#8208;terminal lipidation of the FP may be a useful strategy to induce artificial fusion in biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Clickable Unnatural Sugars in the Unprotected and 1,6&#8208;Di&#8208;O&#8208;Acylated Forms for Metabolic Glycan Labeling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Clickable unnatural sugars have been widely used in studying glycosylation in living systems via the metabolic glycan labelling (MGL) strategy. Partial protection of unnatural sugars by 1,6&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;acylation increases the labelling efficiency while avoiding the non&#8208;specific S&#8208;glyco&#8208;modification. Herein, we report the facile synthesis of a series of clickable unnatural sugars in both the unprotected and 1,6&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;acylated forms at the ten&#8208;gram scale. By evaluation of the labelling specificity, efficiency, and biocompatibility of various 1,6&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;acylated sugars for MGL in cell lines and living mice, we demonstrate that 1,6&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;propionylated unnatural sugars are optimal chemical reporters for glycan labelling. The synthetic routes developed in this work should facilitate the widespread use of MGL with no artificial S&#8208;glyco&#8208;modification for investigating the functional roles of glycans.</dc:description>

         <title>Emission and Luminescent Vapochromism Control of Octahedral Cu4I4 Complexes by Conformationally Restricted P,N Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New conformationally restricted P,N&#8208;ligand capable of the design of polynuclear copper(I) complexes was synthesized via the reaction of primary pyridylphosphine, paraformaldehyde, and benzhydrylamine. The reaction of the ligand with copper(I) iodide leads to the tetranuclear copper(I) complex with the octahedral type of copper&#8208;iodide core. Different orientation of coordination bonds of the ligands relative to the P,N2&#8208;heterocyclic fragments and to the Cu4I4 cores leads to the existence of two types of conformers of the complex with &#8220;compact&#8221; or &#8220;stretched&#8221; geometry of the Cu4I4 cluster. This lability of the complex allowed for obtaining two crystalline phases displaying green or red luminescence. The TDDFT computations along with XRD structural analysis gave a strong interpretation of the green emission belonging to the &#8220;compact&#8221; form of the complex and belonging of the red emission to the &#8220;stretched&#8221; form. Moreover, both crystalline phases demonstrate the strong vapochromic responses of luminescence on the vapors of wide range of solvents.</dc:description>

         <title>Clearing an ESKAPE pathogen in a model organism; a polypyridyl ruthenium(II) complex theranostic that treats a resistant Acinetobacter baumannii infection in Galleria mellonella.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In previous studies we have described the therapeutic action of luminescent dinuclear ruthenium(II) complexes based on the tetrapyridylphenazine, tpphz, bridging ligand on pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis. Herein, the antimicrobial activity of the complex against pernicious Gram&#8208;negative ESKAPE pathogenic strains of Acinetobacter baumannii (AB12, AB16, AB184 and AB210) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA2017, PA_007_IMP and PA_004_CRCN) are reported. Estimated minimum inhibitory concentrations and minimum bactericidal concentrations for the complexes revealed the complex shows potent activity against all A. baumannii strains, in both glucose defined minimal media and standard nutrient rich Mueller&#8208;Hinton&#8208;II. Although the activity was lower in P. aureginosa, a moderately high potency was observed and retained in carbapenem&#8208;resistant strains. Optical microscopy showed that the compound is rapidly internalized by A. baumannii. As previous reports had revealed the complex exhibited no toxicity in Galleria Mellonella up to concentrations of 80 mg/kg, the ability to clear pathogenic infection within this model was explored. The pathogenic concentrations to the larvae for each bacterium were determined to be &#8805; 105 for AB184 and &#8805; 103 CFU/mL for PA2017. It was found a single dose of the compound totally cleared a pathogenic A. baumannii infection from all treated G. mellonella within 96 hours. Uniquely, in these conditions thanks to the imaging properties of the complex the clearance of the bacteria within the hemolymph of G. mellonella could be directly visualized through both optical and transmission electron microscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Ln&#8208;MOF Based Ratiometric Luminescent Sensor for the Detection of Potential COVID&#8208;19 Drugs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Countless people have been affected by the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic on a global scale. Favipiravir, has shown potential as an effective drug for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, attracting scientists&#8217; attention. However, overuse of Favipiravir easily leads to serious side effects, requiring real&#8208;time monitoring in body fluids. Given this, a new lanthanide metal organic framework (MOF) was prepared under solvothermal conditions from either Eu (Eu&#8208;MOF or (1)) or Tb (Tb&#8208;MOF or (2)) using the highly delocalized imidazoledicarboxylic acid linker H2L (H2L = 5&#8208;(4&#8208;(imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl) phenyl) isophthalic acid) and could be successfully applied to selective optical detection of Favipiravir. In this MOF framework, the organic linker H2L provides a high excitation energy transfer efficiency that can sensitize luminescence in lanthanides. In addition, through deliberate tuning of Eu/Tb molar ratio and reaction concentration in the lanthanide framework, ratiometric recyclable luminescent EuxTb1&#8208;x&#8208;MOF nanoparticles with open metal sites have been constructed, which present a high detection sensitivity (Ksv = 1&#215;107 [M&#8208;1], detection limit is 4.63 nM) for Favipiravir. The detection mechanism is discussed with the help of Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations that sheds light over the selective sensing of Favipiravir over other related COVID&#8208;19 drug candidates. Finally, to explore the practical application of Favipiravir sensing, MOF based thin films have been used for visual detection of Favipiravir and recycled 5 times.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Roundabout of Four&#8208;Point&#8208;Star Tiles with the Core Arm Length of Three Half&#8208;Turns for 2D DNA Arrays</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tuning the roundabout of four&#8208;point&#8208;star tiles with the core arm length at three DNA half&#8208;turns, four types of tiles were designed with helper strands traveling via right turn, left turn, bridged longitudinal weaving, or U&#8208;turn for construction of 2D DNA nanostructures. Especially, the one&#8208;locus and/or dual&#8208;locus biotin/streptavidin labelling techniques were applied to judge the chirality of E&#8208;tiling tubes.







Abstract
By rationally adjusting the weaving modes of point&#8208;star tiles, the curvature inherent in the tiles can be changed, and various DNA nanostructures can be assembled, such as planar wireframe meshes, perforated wireframe tubes, and curved wireframe polyhedra. Based on the weaving and tiling architectures for traditional point&#8208;star tiles with the core arm length at two DNA half&#8208;turns, we improved the weaving modes of our newly reported four&#8208;point&#8208;star tiles with the core arm length at three half&#8208;turns to adjust their curvature and rigidity for assembling 2D arrays of DNA grids and tubes. Following our previous terms and methods to analyze the structural details of E&#8208;tiling tubes, we used the chiral indices (n,m) to describe the most abundant tube of typical assemblies; especially, we applied both one&#8208;locus and/or dual&#8208;locus biotin/streptavidin (SA) labelling strategies to define the configurations of two specific tubes, along with the absolute conformations of their component tiles. Such structural details of the DNA tubes composed of tiles with addressable concave and convex faces and packing directions should help us understand their physio&#8208;chemical and biological properties, and therefore promote their applications in drug delivery, biocatalysis, biomedicine, etc.

         <title>PET Imaging of Self&#8208;Assembled 18F&#8208;Labelled Pd2L4 Metallacages for Anticancer Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of two new self&#8208;assembled 18F&#8208;labelled [Pd2L4]4+ cages featuring a hydrophobic cavity able to encapsulate the anticancer drug cisplatin is reported, enabling biodistribution studies by positron emission tomography (PET) in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
To advance the design of self&#8208;assembled metallosupramolecular architectures as new generation theranostic agents, the synthesis of 18F&#8208;labelled [Pd2L4]4+ metallacages is reported. Different spectroscopic and bio&#8208;analytical methods support the formation of the host&#8208;guest cage&#8208;cisplatin complex. The biodistribution profiles of one of the cages, alone or encapsulating cisplatin have been studied by PET/CT imaging in healthy mice in&#8197;vivo, in combination to ICP&#8208;MS ex vivo.

         <title>Gas&#8208;Phase Characterization of Hypervalent Carbon Compounds Bearing 7&#8208;6&#8208;7&#8208;Ring Skeleton: Penta&#8208; versus Tetra&#8208;Coordinate Isomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we afford explicit characterizations of electronic and geometrical structures of recently reported hypervalent penta&#8208;coordinate carbon compounds by using gas&#8208;phase characterization techniques: photodissociation spectroscopy (PDS) and ion mobility&#8208;mass spectrometry (IM&#8208;MS). In particular for a compound with moderately electron donating ligand bearing p&#8208;methylthiophenyl substituents, the coexistence of tetra&#8208; and penta&#8208;coordinate isomers are confirmed, consistent with the solution characterizations. It is in sharp contrast to the exclusive tetra&#8208;coordinate form (with normal valence of the central carbon atom) in the single crystal. This suggests that non&#8208;polar environment makes penta&#8208;coordinate structure thermodynamically most stable. This delicate difference between the tetra&#8208; and penta&#8208;coordinate structures dependent on environments is a close reflection of the lower activation barrier of SN2 reaction found under neutral solvent or gas&#8208;phase reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and crystal structure of a new RTH&#8208;type precursor and its interlayer expanded zeolite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two dimensional zeolites have drawn a lot of attention due to their structural diversity and chemical composition, which can be used to obtain 3D zeolites unable to be direct synthesized. Here, a new layer silicate zeolite L was synthesized using the N, N&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;(2&#8208;methyl)&#8208;benzimidazolium as the structure&#8208;directing agent (SDA) under fluoride condition. Structure determination from the single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals that the pure silica precursor with five&#8208;ring pores in the crystalline sheets is composed of the  rth  layer stacking along the (001) direction in an &#8230;AAAA&#8230; sequence with SDA  +  cations and F  &#8208;  residing within the interlayer spaces. Variable temperature powder X&#8208;ray diffraction results&#160;showed the new layer could transform into 3D RTH topology structure at 350 &#176;C via 2D&#8208;3D topotactic transformation. Furthermore, a new 3D zeolite material is obtained by treating the original layer with diethoxydimethylsilane agent under hydrochloric acid condition (HCl&#8208;DEDMS). Based on the powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) and the original layer structure, the new 3D zeolite structure expanding the  rth  layer linking with another Si atom is constructed, which possesses a 10&#215;8&#215;6 channel system. It displays a high BET surface area of 188 cm  3  /g with an external surface area of 130 cm  3  /g. The structure and textural properties pave a way for the potential catalytic application. The research not only provides a new layer zeolite, broadening the 2D zeolite framework types, but also allows for the discovery of a new stable 3D zeolite expanding the RTH structure with Si atom, which hasn&#8217;t been reported yet.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Two dimensional zeolites have drawn a lot of attention due to their structural diversity and chemical composition, which can be used to obtain 3D zeolites unable to be direct synthesized. Here, a new layer silicate zeolite L was synthesized using the N, N-dimethyl-(2-methyl)-benzimidazolium as the structure-directing agent (SDA) under fluoride condition. Structure determination from the single-crystal X-ray diffraction reveals that the pure silica precursor with five-ring pores in the crystalline sheets is composed of the  rth  layer stacking along the (001) direction in an &#8230;AAAA&#8230; sequence with SDA  +  cations and F  -  residing within the interlayer spaces. Variable temperature powder X-ray diffraction results&#160;showed the new layer could transform into 3D RTH topology structure at 350 &#176;C via 2D-3D topotactic transformation. Furthermore, a new 3D zeolite material is obtained by treating the original layer with diethoxydimethylsilane agent under hydrochloric acid condition (HCl-DEDMS). Based on the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and the original layer structure, the new 3D zeolite structure expanding the  rth  layer linking with another Si atom is constructed, which possesses a 10&#215;8&#215;6 channel system. It displays a high BET surface area of 188 cm  3  /g with an external surface area of 130 cm  3  /g. The structure and textural properties pave a way for the potential catalytic application. The research not only provides a new layer zeolite, broadening the 2D zeolite framework types, but also allows for the discovery of a new stable 3D zeolite expanding the RTH structure with Si atom, which hasn&#8217;t been reported yet.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Sterically encumbered bis(m&#8208;terphenyl)chalcogenides, (2,6&#8208;Mes2C6H3)E (E = S, Se, Te) were obtained by the reaction of the chalcogen tetrafluorides, EF4, with three equivalents of m&#8208;terphenyl lithium, 2,6&#8208;Mes2C6H3Li. The single electron oxidation of (2,6&#8208;Mes2C6H3)2Te using XeF2 / K[B(C6F5)4] afforded the radical cation [(2,6&#8208;Mes2C6H3)2Te][B(C6F5)4] that was isolated and fully characterized.

         <title>Fluorescence Turn&#8208;on of Tetraphenylethylene Derivative by Transfer from Cyclodextrin to Liposomes, HeLa cells, and E. coli</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, trimethyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CDx) and &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#947;&#8208;CDx) could dissolve a tetraphenylethylene derivative (TPE&#8208;OH4) in water through high&#8208;speed vibration milling. The fluorescence intensity of the TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CDx&#8211;TPE&#8208;OH4 complex was much higher than that of the &#947;&#8208;CDx&#8211;TPE&#8208;OH4 complex, as the rotation of the central C&#9552;C double bond of TPE&#8208;OH4 after photoactivation was inhibited in a smaller TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CDx cavity in comparison with the &#947;&#8208;CDx cavity. In contrast, the fluorescence intensity of the &#947;&#8208;CDx&#8211;TPE&#8208;OH4 complex was very weak; nevertheless, it increased after the addition of liposomes due to the transfer of TPE&#8208;OH4 from the &#947;&#8208;CDx cavity to the lipid membrane as a &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; phenomenon. Furthermore, to apply temperature sensor, we demonstrated that the fluorescence intensity in the liposomes depended on the phase transition temperature. By using the fluorescence turn&#8208;on phenomenon, TPE&#8208;OH4 could detect the presence of HeLa cells and E. coli by fluorescence.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperative photochemical reaction kinetics in organic molecular crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoreactive molecular crystals have been intensively investigated as next&#8208;generation functional materials. Changes in physicochemical properties are usually interpreted in terms of static pre&#8208; and post&#8208;reaction molecular structures and packings determined by X&#8208;ray structure analysis. However, to elucidate the dynamic properties, it is necessary to understand the dynamic nature of photochemical kinetics in crystals. Reaction dynamics in the crystal phase can be dramatically different from those in dilute solution because the local molecular environment evolves as the surrounding reactant molecules are transformed into products.&#160; In this review, we summarize multiple examples of photochemical reactions in the crystalline phase that do not follow classical kinetic behavior.&#160; We also discuss different theoretical methods that can be used to describe this behavior. This review article should help provide a foundation for future workers to understand and analyze photochemical reaction kinetics in crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Hydrogen&#8208;bonded Organic Frameworks: Structures and Functional Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a new class of porous crystalline materials, hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) assembled from building blocks via hydrogen bonds have gained increasing attention. HOFs benefit from advantages including mild synthesis, easy purification, and good recyclability. However, some HOFs transform into unstable frameworks after desolvation, which hinders&#160;their further applications. Nowadays, the main challenges of developing HOFs lie in stability improvement, porosity establishment, and functionalization. Recently, more and more stable and permanently porous HOFs have been reported. Among all these design strategies, stronger charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonds and coordination bonds have been proven to be effective for developing stable, porous, and functional solids&#160;called hybrid HOFs, including ionic and metallized HOFs. This review discusses the rational design synthesis principles of hybrid HOFs and their cutting&#8208;edge&#160;applications in selective inclusion, proton conduction, gas separation, catalysis and so forth.</dc:description>

         <title>The Insertion of EII and EIV Chlorides (E=Si, Ge) into the Si&#8722;Si Bond of Disilylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inserting tetrylenes into the Si&#8722;Si bond of a base&#8208;stabilized disilylene produced new examples of bis(silylene), asymmetric disilylene and germylene&#8208;silylene compounds. Additionally, the reactivity of the starting disilylene towards SiIV chlorides was investigated.







Abstract
Reactions of silicon and germanium dichlorides L&#8901;ECl2 (E=Si, L=IPr; E=Ge, L=dioxane) with the phosphinoamidinato&#8208;supported disilylene ({&#954;2(N,P)&#8208;NNP}Si)2 resulted in formal tetrylene insertions into the Si&#8722;Si bond. In the case of the reaction with silylene, two products were isolated. The first product ({&#954;2(N,P)&#8208;NNP}Si)2SiCl2, is the formal product of direct SiCl2 insertion into the Si&#8722;Si bond of ({&#954;2(N,P)&#8208;NNP}Si)2 and thus features two separated silylamido silylene centers. Over time, migration of the SiCl2 group to a lateral position afforded the second product, the disilylene {&#954;2(Si,P)&#8722;SiCl2NNP}Si&#8722;Si{&#954;2(N,P)&#8208;NNP}. In contrast, insertion of GeCl2 resulted only in the isolation of the germanium analogue of {&#954;2(Si,P)&#8722;SiCl2NNP}Si&#8722;Si{&#954;2(N,P)&#8208;NNP}, containing a Ge atom in the central position namely, compound {&#954;2(Si,P)&#8722;SiCl2NNP}Ge&#8722;Si{&#954;2(N,P)&#8208;NNP}, which is a rare example of a silylene&#8208;germylene. Finally, reaction of disilylene ({&#954;2(N,P)&#8722;NNP}Si)2 with SiCl4 and SiHCl3 led to the formation of the new bis(silyl)silylene, ({NNP}SiCl2)2Si:. All four new products from these insertion reactions have been characterized by multinuclear NMR and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies.

         <title>Reactivity of E4 (E4=P4, As4, AsP3) towards Low&#8208;Valent Al(I) and Ga(I) Compounds</title>

Bond by bond. The conversion of yellow arsenic with the group 13 metal compound [LGa] (L=[{N(C6H3iPr2&#8208;2,6)C(Me)}2CH]&#8722;) leads to one As&#8722;As bond cleavage in [LGa(&#951;1:1&#8208;As4)]. By reacting this product with an unsaturated metal complex, two further As&#8722;As bonds are broken, to form a butadiene&#8208;like As4 chain stabilized in the coordination sphere of transition metals as well as main group metals.







Abstract
The reactivity of yellow arsenic and the interpnictogen compound AsP3 towards low&#8208;valent group 13 compounds was investigated. The reactions of [LAl] (1, L=[{N(C6H3iPr2&#8208;2,6)C(Me)}2CH]&#8722;) with As4 and AsP3 lead to [(LAl)2(&#956;,&#951;1:1:1:1&#8208;E4)] (E4=As4 (3&#8201;b), AsP3 (3&#8201;c)) by insertion of two fragments [LAl] into two of the six E&#8722;E edges of the E4 tetrahedra. Furthermore, the reaction of [LGa] (2) with E4 afforded [LGa(&#951;1:1&#8208;E4)] (E4=As4 (4&#8201;b), AsP3 (4&#8201;c)). In these compounds, only one E&#8722;E bond of the E4 tetrahedra was cleaved. These compounds represent the first examples of the conversion of yellow arsenic and AsP3, respectively, with group 13 compounds. Furthermore, the reactivity of the gallium complexes towards unsaturated transition metal units or polypnictogen (En) ligand complexes was investigated. This leads to the heterobimetallic compounds [(LGa)(&#956;,&#951;2:1:1&#8208;P4)(LNi)] (5&#8201;a), [(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co)(&#956;,&#951;4:1:1&#8208;E4)(LGa)] (E=P (6&#8201;a), As (6&#8201;b), Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;=&#951;5&#8208;C5H2tBu3) and [(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Ni)(&#951;3:1:1&#8208;E3)(LGa)] (E=P (7&#8201;a), As (7&#8201;b)), which combine two different ligand systems in one complex (nacnac and Cp) as well as two different types of metals (main group and transition metals). The products were characterized by crystallographic and spectroscopic methods.

         <title>Interactive Bioconjugation at N&#8208;Terminal Cysteines by Using O&#8208;Salicylaldehyde Esters towards Dual Site&#8208;Selective Functionalization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Terminal cysteine is a hot&#8208;spot for bioconjugation that enables the construction of complex bioconjugates. In this study, we show that O&#8208;salicylaldehyde esters are a fast and selective reagent for modifying N&#8208;terminal cysteine, which can be easily removed under acidic conditions, and used in dual site&#8208;selective bioconjugations. More information can be found in the Research Article by M.&#8197;J.&#8197;S.&#8197;A. Silva, P.&#8197;M.&#8197;P. Gois, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202377).

         <title>Selective Separation of Hazardous Chemicals from Vapor phase by an Easily Accessible Breathing Coordination Polymer Derived from Terpyridyl/terephthalate Mixed Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coordination polymers are extensively studied materials because of their various potential applications. Amongst them, breathing coordination polymers that are capable of exchanging lattice occluded guest molecules with other guests via single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SC&#8208;SC) fashion are particularly intriguing. Herein, we disclose an easily accessible breathing coordination polymer namely DMF@Zn&#8208;CP capable of exchanging as many as 23 guest molecules of various kinds in SC&#8208;SC fashion when the crystals of the coordination polymer were exposed to the corresponding vapor of the guests. Selectivity experiments revealed that it was also capable of separating selectively hazardous chemicals such as dichloro&#8208;methane, benzene and fluorobenzene from the corresponding complex mixture of vapors of halomethanes, aromatic hydrocarbons and halobenzenes. The breathing coordination polymer could also be exploited as drug delivery vehicle; slow and sustained release of anti&#8208;bacterial agents (benzyl alcohol/phenethyl amine) as guests against both gram positive and gram negative bacteria was evident in zone inhibition assays. A mixed ligand strategy wherein a nitrile containing terpyridyl ligand (L) and terephthalate (TA) co&#8208;ligand were reacted with Co(II)/Ni(II)/Zn(II) nitrate salts was adopted herein. Three coordination polymers namely MeOH@Co&#8208;CP, DMF/H2O@Ni&#8208;CP and DMF@Zn&#8208;CP were isolated and characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Studies revealed that only DMF@Zn&#8208;CP possessed the ability to breath in response to the vapors of the guests as stimuli.</dc:description>

         <title>Light Modulated Reversible &#8220;On&#8208;Off&#8221; Transformation of Arylazoheteroarene Based Discotics in Nematic Organization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoswitchable mesogens: A series of reversibly photoswitchable C3&#8208;symmetric discotic liquid crystals have been made using a threefold phenylazo&#8208;3,5&#8208;dimethylisoxazole tethered benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) core. In a discotic nematic organization, they exhibit high thermal stability of metastable states, excellent reversibility in photoswitching, and robust light&#8208;controlled mesomorphological changes.

Three benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) core&#8208;based molecular systems appended with phenylazo&#8208;3,5&#8208;dimethylisoxazole photoswitches at the peripheral position through variable&#8208;length alkoxy chains have been designed and synthesized. The supramolecular interactions of the mesogens provided discotic nematic liquid crystalline assembly as confirmed by polarized optical microscopy (POM) and X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) studies. Spectroscopic studies confirmed the reversible photoswitching and excellent thermal stability of the photoswitched states in solution phase and thin film. Also, atomic force microscopic (AFM) and POM investigations demonstrated the morphological changes in the self&#8208;assembly induced by the photoirradiation as monitored by the changes in the height profiles and optical appearance of the textures, respectively. Remarkably, the liquid crystalline discotic molecules showed reversible &#8220;on and off states&#8221; controlled by light at ambient temperature.

         <title>Metallic Catalysts for Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane Using CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metallic catalysts in the CO2&#8722;ODP reaction are summarized in detail in view of various aspects such as the type of materials, catalyst design concepts, reaction mechanisms, and the role of CO2.







Abstract
The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO2 (CO2&#8722;ODP) is a promising technique for realizing high&#8208;yield propylene production and CO2 usage. Developing a highly efficient catalyst for CO2&#8722;ODP is essential and beneficial to the chemical industry and for realizing net&#8208;zero emissions. Many studies have investigated metal oxide&#8208;based catalysts, revealing that rapid deactivation and low selectivity remain limiting factors for their industrial applications. In recent years, metallic nanoparticle catalysts have become increasingly attractive due to their unique properties. Therefore, we summarize the performance of metal&#8208;based catalysts in CO2&#8722;ODP reactions by considering catalyst design concepts, different mechanisms in the reaction process, and the role of CO2.

         <title>A Potent Auto&#8208;Umpolung Ligand for Conjugative Radical Stabilization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bis(dicyanomethid)cyclopropenium&#8208;based &#8220;auto&#8208;umpolung&#8221; carbene ligand stabilizes a neutral nitrogen radical. The latter is characterized via EPR measurements in solution and X&#8208;ray structural analyses in the solid state. Both indicate that the radical is in equilibrium with aggregates and a &#963;&#8208;bound dimer.







Abstract
Carbenes with conjugatively connected redox system act as &#8220;auto&#8208;umpolung&#8221; ligands. Due to their electronic flexibility, they should also be particularly suitable to stabilize open&#8208;shell species. Herein, the first neutral radical of such sort is described in form of a dialkylamino&#8208;substituted bis(dicyanomethylene)cyclopropanide. Despite the absence of steric shielding, the radical is stable for an extended amount of time and was consequently characterized in solution via EPR measurements. These data and accompanying X&#8208;ray structural analyses indicate that the radical species is in equilibrium with aggregates (formed via &#960;&#8208;stacking) and dimers (obtained via &#963;&#8208;bond formation between methylene carbons).

         <dc:description>
The advances in oxidative N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalysis are reviewed according to the strategies that rely on typical NHC&#8208;bound intermediates, including acyl/imidoyl azolium, &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acyl azolium, and azolium peroxide species, as well as NHC&#8208;derived ortho&#8208;quinone methide (o&#8208;QM), aza&#8208;fulvene, and triaza&#8208;diene intermediates, with particular focus on mechanistic aspects.







Abstract
Oxidative N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis offers the chance to perform oxidative and oxygenative transformations which give rise to various NHC&#8208;bound intermediates, paving the way to non&#8208;umpolung processes through activation of carbon atoms and heteroatoms. The aim of this review is to discuss the developments of the literature in the field of oxidative NHC&#8208;catalysis since 2014, with particular focus to pivotal intermediates and their mechanistic involvement.

         <title>On the Mechanism of the Formal [2+2] Cycloaddition &#8211; Retro&#8208;electrocyclization (CA&#8208;RE) Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#8220;click&#8208;like&#8221; [2+2] cycloaddition &#8208; retro&#8208;electrocyclization (CA&#8208;RE) reaction was followed under a variety of conditions using NMR spectroscopy. Several mechanistic models were evaluated by considering multiple experiments simultaneously. Surprisingly, only a model in which the final 1,1,4,4&#8208;tetracyanobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene product promoted the first step described well all the data. The CA&#8208;RE reaction is hence an autocatalytic reaction.







Abstract
The [2+2] cycloaddition &#8208; retro&#8208;electrocyclization (CA&#8208;RE) reaction is a &#8220;click&#8208;like&#8221; protocol for facile synthesis of donor&#8208;acceptor chromophores from an alkyne and tetracyanoethylene. Herein we shed light on the mechanism of this reaction by detailed kinetics studies using 1H NMR spectroscopy. By considering several experiments simultaneously, a variety of mechanistic models was evaluated. Surprisingly, a model in which the final 1,1,4,4&#8208;tetracyanobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene product promoted the first step was the only one that described well the experimental data. This autocatalysis model also involved a non&#8208;concerted, stepwise formation of the cyclobutene cycloaddition adduct. By proper choice of conditions, we were able to generate the transient cyclobutene in sufficient amount to verify it as an intermediate using 13C NMR spectroscopy. For its final retro&#8208;electrocyclization step, simple first&#8208;order kinetics was observed and only minor solvent dependence, which indicates a concerted reaction.

By proper choice of conditions, we were able to generate the transient cyclobutene in sufficient amount to verify it as an intermediate using &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR spectroscopy. For its final retro-electrocyclization step, simple first-order kinetics was observed and only minor solvent dependence, which indicates a concerted reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Carbonyl&#8208;Containing Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters for Narrow&#8208;Band Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The progress of ketone&#8208;based TADF emitters with narrow&#8208;band properties is summarized. The molecular design involved in maintaining excellent device efficiency and extraordinary color purity is highlighted.







Abstract
Carbonyl&#8208;containing derivatives show enduring vitality in the field of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials; they can realize high device efficiency by using both singlet and triplet excitons for electroluminescence. Recently, a system based on fused ketone/amine exhibited huge potential for constructing multi&#8208;resonance TADF (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters, which exhibit higher narrow&#8208;band emission than conventional TADF emitters with twisted donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) structure. Herein, we summarize current research progress in both traditional and MR&#8208;type ketone derivatives with TADF characteristics for introducing the molecular design strategy of maintaining high device efficiency while keeping narrow&#8208;band emission profile. We hope this review can inspire the emergence of more high&#8208;performance narrow&#8208;band materials.

         <title>Characterization of the glmS Ribozymes from Listeria Monocytogenes and Clostridium Difficile</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The glmS ribozyme of L. monocytogenes stringently discriminates between co&#8208;factors and retains cleavage activity at low temperatures, illustrating unique characteristics of individual glmS ribozymes.







Abstract
The glmS ribozyme regulates the expression of the essential GlmS enzyme being involved in cell wall biosynthesis. While &gt;450 variants of the glmS ribozyme were identified by in silico approaches and homology searches, only a few have yet been experimentally investigated. Herein, we validate and characterize the glmS ribozymes of the human pathogens Clostridium difficile and Listeria monocytogenes. Both ribozymes, as their previous characterized homologs rely on glucosamine&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate as co&#8208;factor and the presence of divalent cations for exerting the cleavage reaction. The observed EC50 values in turn were found to be in the submicromolar range, at least an order of magnitude lower than observed for glmS ribozymes from other bacteria. The glmS ribozyme of L. monocytogenes was further shown to bear unique properties. It discriminates between co&#8208;factors very stringently and other than the glmS ribozyme of C. difficile retains activity at low temperatures. This finding illustrates that albeit being highly conserved, glmS ribozymes have unique characteristics.

         <title>Divergent Copper&#8208;salt&#8208;controlled Reactions of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes and N&#8208;Fluorobenzene Sulfonimide: Access to the 1,3&#8208;Haloamines and Aminoindanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for divergent copper&#8208;salt&#8208;controlled ring&#8208;opening 1,3&#8208;bifunctionalization reactions of D&#8208;A cyclopropanes was developed; 1,3&#8208;aminohalogenation and 1,3&#8208;aminoarylation products were generated in moderate to good yields.







Abstract
We herein report a method for divergent copper salt controlled reactions of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes and N&#8208;fluorobenzene sulfonimide (NFSI). Specifically, in the presence of CuX2 (X=Cl, Br), the cyclopropanes underwent formal umpolung 1,3&#8208;aminohalogenation bifunctionalization via a free radical mediated ring&#8208;opening process to afford 1,3&#8208;aminochlorination and 1,3&#8208;aminobromination products in moderate to good yields. In addition, by using CuI as a catalyst, we synthesized various aminoindane derivatives via 1,3&#8208;aminoarylation cyclization of D&#8208;A cyclopropanes, the reactions involved a free radical mediated ring&#8208;opening and subsequent ring expansion via C&#8722;H bond activation.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Borylation of Propargylic Acetates for the Synthesis of Multisubstituted Allenylboronates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multisubstituted allenylboronates were easily accessed through iron&#8208;catalyzed borylation of propargylic acetates. The reaction is highly efficient, occurs under mild conditions, and is easy to scale up. The reaction is stereospecific and occurs with anti&#8208;SN2&#8216; displacement of the acetate by boron, which allows a transfer of chirality. Several transformations including propargylation and further additions highlight the synthetic utility of this reaction.







Abstract
A novel iron&#8208;catalyzed borylation of propargylic acetates leading to allenylboronates has been developed. The method allows the preparation of a variety of di&#8208;, tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted allenylboronates at room temperature with good functional group compatibility. Stereochemical studies show that an anti&#8208;SN2&#8217; displacement of acetate by boron occurs; this also allows transfer of chirality to yield enantiomerically enriched allenylboronates. The synthetic utility of this protocol was further substantiated by transformations of the obtained allenylboronates including oxidation and propargylation.

         <title>Chiral&#8208;at&#8208;Metal Silver&#8208;Mediated Base Pairs: Metal&#8208;Centred Chirality versus DNA Helical Chirality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For a small number of consecutive metal&#8208;mediated base pairs in a DNA duplex, the chirality&#8208;at&#8208;metal of a chiral metal&#8208;mediated base pair is determined by the intrinsic helical chirality of the duplex. With an increasing number of adjacent metal&#8208;mediated base pairs, the chirality&#8208;at&#8208;metal can topple so that the intrinsically preferred isomer is adopted.







Abstract
When covalently incorporating ligands capable of forming chiral metal complexes into a DNA oligonucleotide duplex, an enantiospecific formation of metal&#8208;mediated base pairs is possible. We have been investigating the chirality of the silver&#8208;mediated base pair P&#8722;AgI&#8722;P (P, 1H&#8208;imidazo[4,5&#8208;f][1,10]phenanthroline) depending on the number of consecutive P&#8201;:&#8201;P pairs within a series of duplexes. Towards this end, both enantiomers of the nucleoside analogue 3&#8208;(1H&#8208;imidazo[4,5&#8208;f][1,10]phenanthrolin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)propane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diol comprising an acyclic backbone were introduced into DNA duplexes, resulting in diastereomeric metal&#8208;mediated base pairs. The same chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal complex is formed inside the duplex for up to five neighbouring P&#8722;AgI&#8722;P pairs, irrespective of whether (S)&#8208;P or (R)&#8208;P is used. With six silver&#8208;mediated base pairs, the chirality of the metal complex is inverted for (S)&#8208;P but not for (R)&#8208;P. This indicates an intricate balance of what determines the configuration of the metal complex, the intrinsically preferred metal&#8208;centred chirality or the DNA helical chirality.

Towards this end, both enantiomers of the nucleoside analogue 3-(1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-imidazo[4,5-&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;][1,10]phenanthrolin-1-yl)propane-1,2-diol comprising an acyclic backbone were introduced into DNA duplexes, resulting in diastereomeric metal-mediated base pairs. The same chiral-at-metal complex is formed inside the duplex for up to five neighbouring &lt;b&gt;P&lt;/b&gt;&#8722;Ag&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;b&gt;P&lt;/b&gt; pairs, irrespective of whether (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-&lt;b&gt;P&lt;/b&gt; or (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-&lt;b&gt;P&lt;/b&gt; is used. With six silver-mediated base pairs, the chirality of the metal complex is inverted for (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-&lt;b&gt;P&lt;/b&gt; but not for (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-&lt;b&gt;P&lt;/b&gt;. This indicates an intricate balance of what determines the configuration of the metal complex, the intrinsically preferred metal-centred chirality or the DNA helical chirality.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>The 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3,4,5,6&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;azaborinines 1&#8208;EMe3 and 2&#8208;EMe3 (E = Si, Sn; aryl = Ph (1), Mes (= 2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl, 2)) were synthesized by ring&#8208;expansion of borole precursors with N3EMe3&#8208;derived nitrenes. Desilylative hydrolysis of 1&#8208; and 2&#8208;SiMe3 yielded the corresponding N&#8208;protonated azaborinines, which were deprotonated with nBuLi or MN(SiMe3)2 (M = Na, K) to the corresponding group 1 salts, 1&#8208;M and 2&#8208;M. While the lithium salts crystallized as monomeric Lewis base adducts, the potassium salts formed coordination polymers or oligomers via intramolecular K&#183;&#183;&#183;aryl &#960; interactions. The reaction of 1&#8208;M or 2&#8208;M with CO2 yielded N&#8208;carboxylate salts, which were derivatized by salt metathesis to methyl and silyl esters. Salt metathesis of 1&#8208;M or 2&#8208;M with methyl triflate, [Cp*BeCl] (Cp* = C5Me5), BBr2Ar (Ar = Ph, Mes, 2&#8208;thienyl), ECl3 (E = B, Al, Ga) and PX3 (X = Cl, Br) afforded the respective group 2, 3 and 5 1,2&#8208;azaborinin&#8208;2&#8208;yl complexes. Salt metathesis of 1&#8208;K with BBr3 resulted not only in N&#8208;borylation but also Ph&#8208;Br exchange between the endocyclic and exocyclic boron atoms. Solution 11B NMR data suggest that the1,2&#8208;azaborinin&#8208;2&#8208;yl ligand is similarly electron&#8208;withdrawing to a bromide. In the solid state the endocyclic bond length alternation and the twisting of the C4BN ring increase with the sterics of the substituents at the boron and nitrogen atoms, respectively. Regression analyses revealed that the downfield shift of the endocyclic 11B NMR resonances is linearly correlated to both the degree of twisting of the C4BN ring and the tilt angle of the N&#8208;substituent. Calculations indicate that the 1,2&#8208;azaborinin&#8208;1&#8208;yl ligand has no sizeable &#960;&#8208;donor ability and that the aromaticity of the ring can be subtly tuned by the electronics of the N&#8208;substituent.</dc:description>

         <title>Concertedness and Activation Energy Control by Distal Methyl Group during Ring Contraction/Expansion in Scalarane&#8208;type Sesterterpenoid Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Salmahyritisol A, similan A, and hippospongide A, which are scalarane&#8208;type sesterterpenoids, feature 6/6/5/7/5 pentacyclic skeletons. Although their biosyntheses have been previously proposed to involve a unique skeletal rearrangement reaction, the detailed reaction mechanism remains unclear as none of the corresponding biosynthetic enzymes for this reaction have been reported. Herein, we investigated this skeletal rearrangement reaction using computational techniques, which revealed the following four key features: (i) the distal 24&#8208;Me substituent controls both the concertedness and activation energy of this transformation, (ii) enzymes are not responsible for the observed regioselectivity of C12&#8211;C20 bond formation, (iii) stereoselectivity is enzyme&#8208;regulated, and (iv) protonation is a key step in this skeletal rearrangement process. These new findings provide insight into the C&#8208;ring&#8208;contraction and D&#8208;ring&#8208;expansion mechanisms in scalarane&#8208;type sesterterpenoid biosyntheses.</dc:description>

         <title>Resolving the Chemical Formula of Nesquehonite via&#160;NMR Crystallography, DFT Computation, and Complementary Neutron Diffraction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nesquehonite is a magnesium carbonate mineral relevant to carbon sequestration envisioned for carbon capture and storage of CO2. Its chemical formula remains controversial today, assigned as either a hydrated magnesium carbonate [MgCO3&#8226;3H2O], or a hydroxy &#8208; hydrated &#8208; magnesium bicarbonate [Mg(HCO3)OH&#8226;2H2O]. The resolution of this controversy is central to understanding this material's thermodynamic, phase, and chemical behavior. We present an NMR crystallography study, using rotational&#8208;echo double&#8208;resonance 13C{1H} (REDOR) to determine 13C &#8208; 1H distances with precision, and the combination of 13C static NMR lineshapes and density &#8208; functional theory (DFT) calculations to model different H atomic coordinates. We find [MgCO3&#8226;3H2O] to be accurate, and evidence from neutron powder diffraction bolstered these assignments.&#160;Refined H positions can help us understand how H&#8208;bonding stabilizes this structure against dehydration to MgCO3. More broadly, our results illustrate the power of NMR crystallography as a technique for resolving questions where X&#8208;ray diffraction is inconclusive.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Interactions Between Brilliant Green and MscL Investigated by Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy and Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state NMR and molecular dynamics simulations were performed to study the dynamic pathway of triarylmethane dye Brilliant Green (BG) through the antimicrobial target MscL protein. Key residues (especially F23 and I27) and the specific processes that act on BG through the Ma&#8208;MscL channel are identified, and proof is presented that BG activates the hydrophobic gate of Ma&#8208;MscL by its bound water molecules.







Abstract
The mechanosensitive ion channel of large conductance (MscL) is a promising template for the development of new antibiotics due to its high conservation and uniqueness to microbes. Brilliant green (BG), a triarylmethane dye, has been identified as a new antibiotic targeted MscL. However, the detailed binding sites to MscL and the dynamic pathway of BG through the MscL channel remain unknown. Here, the dynamic interactions between BG and MscL were investigated using solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and molecule dynamics (MD) simulations. Residue site&#8208;specific binding sites of BG to the MscL channel were identified by solid&#8208;state NMR. In addition, MD simulations revealed that BG conducts through the MscL channel via residues along the inner surface of the pore sequentially, in which the strong hydrophobic interactions between BG and hydrophobic residues F23 and I27 in the hydrophobic gate region of the MscL channel are major restrictions. Particularly, it was demonstrated that BG activates the MscL channel by reducing the hydrophobicity of the F23 in the gate region by water molecules that are bound to BG. Taken together, these simulations and experimental data provide novel insights into the dynamic interactions between BG and MscL, based on which new hydrophobic antibiotics and adjuvants targeting MscL can be developed.

         <title>Direct Aroylation of Olefins through a Cobalt/Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylative and Dehydrogenative Coupling with &#945;&#8208;Oxo Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible light promotes decarboxylative Heck&#8208;like benzoylations of olefins. This process leverages the synergistic interaction of a photoredox catalyst with cobaloxime catalysts to form enones through decarboxylation and hydrogen evolution. Mechanistic studies reveal different rate&#8208;limiting steps, depending on electronics of the olefin.







Abstract
A photoredox/cobalt dual catalytic procedure has been developed that allows benzoylation of olefins. Here the photoredox catalyst effects the decarboxylation of &#945;&#8208;ketoacids to form benzoyl radicals. After addition of this radical to styrenes, the cobalt catalyst abstracts a H&#8208;atom. Hydrogen evolution from the putative cobalt hydride intermediate allows a Heck&#8208;like aroylation without the need for a stoichiometric oxidant. Mechanistic studies reveal that electronically different styrenes lead to a curved Hammett plot, thus suggesting a change in product&#8208;determining step in the catalytic mechanism.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A photoredox/cobalt dual catalytic procedure has been developed that allows benzoylation of olefins. Here the photoredox catalyst effects the decarboxylation of &#945;-ketoacids to form benzoyl radicals. After addition of this radical to styrenes, the cobalt catalyst abstracts a H-atom. Hydrogen evolution from the putative cobalt hydride intermediate allows a Heck-like aroylation without the need for a stoichiometric oxidant. Mechanistic studies reveal that electronically different styrenes lead to a curved Hammett plot, thus suggesting a change in product-determining step in the catalytic mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modeling Type&#8208;1 Iodothyronine Deiodinase with Peptide&#8208;Based Aliphatic Diselenides: Potential Role of Highly Conserved His and Cys Residues as a General Acid Catalyst</title>

         <dc:description>
Type&#8208;1&#8201;iodothyronine deiodinase, which promotes the deiodination of iodine atoms on the outer and inner rings of thyroxine, was successfully modeled using a peptide&#8208;based selenocompound. Kinetic analyses of this reaction suggested that highly conserved His and Cys residues at the active site crucially act as general acid catalysts together with the selenocysteine redox center. Modeling Type&#8208;1 Iodothyronine Deiodinase with Peptide&#8208;Based Aliphatic Diselenides: Potential Role of Highly Conserved His and Cys Residues as a General Acid Catalyst (K. Arai et&#8197;al.)







Abstract
Type&#8208;1 iodothyronine deiodinase (ID&#8208;1) catalyzes the reductive elimination of 5&#8217;&#8208;I and 5&#8208;I on the phenolic and tyrosyl rings of thyroxine (T4), respectively. Chemically verifying whether I atoms with different chemical properties undergo deiodination through a common mechanism is challenging. Herein, we report the modeling of ID&#8208;1 using aliphatic diselenide (Se&#8208;Se) and selenenylsulfide (Se&#8208;S) compounds. Mechanistic investigations of deiodination using the ID&#8208;1&#8208;like reagents suggested that the 5&#8217;&#8208;I and 5&#8208;I deiodinations proceed via the same mechanism through an unstable intermediate containing a Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I halogen bond between a selenolate anion, reductively produced from Se&#8208;Se (or Se&#8208;S) in the compound, and an I atom in T4. Moreover, imidazolium and thiol groups, which may act as general acid catalysts, promoted the heterolytic cleavage of the C&#8208;I bond in the Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I intermediate, which is the rate&#8208;determining step, by donating a proton to the C atom.

         <title>Heavy Chains: Synthesis, Reactivity and Decomposition of Interpnictogen Chains with Terminal Diaryl Bismuth Fragments</title>

         <dc:description>
Making and breaking chains. Interpnictogen chains have been synthesized, and their decomposition has been studied. It was shown that the compound Ph2BiP(tBu)BiPh2 reacts with the small N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (Me2IMe) as a &#8220;masked phosphinidene&#8221; to form Me2IMe=PtBu.







Abstract
In this work, we report the preparation of multiple interpnictogen chain compounds with three consecutive pnictogen atoms and terminal Ar2Bi fragments (Ar=Ph, Mes). Symmetrical compounds of the form Ar2Bi&#8722;E(tBu)&#8722;Bi2Ar (1: Ar=Ph, E=P; 2: Ar=Ph, Mes, E=As) as well as ternary interpnictogen compounds of the form Ar2Bi&#8722;E1(tBu)&#8722;E2tBu2 (Ar=Ph, Mes; 4: E1=P, E2=As; 5: E1=P, E2=Sb; 6: E1=As, E2=P) were prepared. The decomposition in solution at room temperature and under the influence of light was studied for compounds 1&#8211;6. The reactivity of 1Ph and 2Ph with the small N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene 1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (Me2IMe) was also studied. In the case of 1Ph, the formation and consecutive decomposition of Me2IMe=PtBu (8) was observed in solution. Hence, it was shown that 1Ph can react as a &#8220;masked phosphinidene&#8221;. In the case of 2Ph, no reaction with Me2IMe was observed. All isolated compounds were analysed by NMR and IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Gated, Selective Anion Exchange in Functionalized Self&#8208;Assembled Cage Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Appending functional groups to the exterior of Zn4L4 self&#8208;assembled cages allows gated control of anion binding. While the unfunctionalized cages contain aryl groups in the ligand that can freely rotate, attaching inert functional groups creates a &#8220;doorstop&#8221;, preventing rotation and slowing the guest exchange rate, even though the interiors of the host cavities are identically structured. The effects on anion exchange are subtle and depend on multiple factors, including anion size, the nature of the leaving anion, and the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability and steric bulk of the pendant groups. Multiple exchange mechanisms occur, and the nature of the external groups controls associative and dissociative exchange processes: these bulky groups affect both anion egress and ingress, introducing an extra layer of selectivity to the exchange. Small changes can have large effects: affinities for anions as similar as PF6&#8208; and SbF6&#8208; can vary by as much as 400&#8208;fold between identically sized cavities.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Thiapyricins (TPC&#8208;A/B, 1 and 2), which are novel metallophore scaffolds exhibiting selective divalent cation binding property, were produced in response to metal&#8208;deprived conditions by Saccharothrix sp. TRM_47004 isolated from the Lop Nor Salt Lake. TPCs represent a thiazolyl&#8208;pyridine skeleton of a calcium&#8208;binding natural product, calciphore, owing to the selectivity to calcium ions among diverse metal ions. The thiapyricins exhibited notable co&#8208;crystalline characteristics of the apo&#8208; and holo&#8208;forms with racemic enantiomers comprising a pair of space isomers in a &#916;/&#923;&#8208;form. Therefore, we postulated a mechanism for the four&#8208;hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of achiral natural products into chiral complexes. Furthermore, their metal&#8208;chelating trait aided the adaptation of the host during metal starvation by increasing the production of TPCs. This study presents a structural paradigm of a new calciphore, provides insight into the mechanism of natural product assembly, and highlights the causality between the production of the metallophore and metallic habitats.</dc:description>

         <title>Promoted Photothermal Catalytic CO Hydrogenation Using TiC&#8208;supported Co&#8208;Fe5C2&#160;Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photothermal catalytic CO hydrogenation offers the potential for synthesizing light hydrocarbons using renewable solar energy. However, the reaction selectivity and activity are still far below those achieved in the conventional thermal catalytic processes. Herein, we report that the Co&#8208;modified Fe5C2 on TiC catalyst promotes the photothermal catalytic CO hydrogenation with a 59% C2+ selectivity in the produced hydrocarbons and a 30% single&#8208;pass CO conversion at a high gas hourly space&#8208;time velocity of 12000 mL g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. Using insitu irradiated XPS, we show that the light&#8208;induced hot electron injection from TiC to Fe5C2 modulates the chemical state of Fe, thereby increasing the CO&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ conversion. This work suggests that plasmon&#8208;mediated surface chemistry is possible to enhance the activity and selectivity of photothermal catalytic reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Lead&#8208;Free Metal Halide Perovskite Nanocrystals: From Fundamentals to Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lead&#8208;free metal halide Perovskite nanocrystals have emerged with promising properties to circumvent the important issues that still need to be addressed, such as stability and Pb toxicity, to enable practical and safe applications of perovskites.







Abstract
Lead (Pb) halide perovskite nanocrystals, with the general formula APbX3, where A=CH3NH3+, CH(NH2)2+, or Cs+ and X=Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, or I&#8722;, have emerged as a class of materials with promising properties due to their remarkable optical properties and solar cell performance. However, important issues still need to be addressed to enable practical applications of these materials, such as instability, mass production, and Pb toxicity. Recent studies have carried out the replacement of Pb by various less&#8208;toxic cations as Sn, Ge, Sb, and Bi. This variety of chemical compositions provide Pb&#8208;free perovskite and metal halide nanostructures with a wide spectral range, in addition to being considered less toxic, therefore having greater practical applicability. Highlighting the necessity to address and solve the toxicity problems related to Pb&#8208;containing perovskite, this review considers the prospects of the Pb&#8208;free perovskite, involving synthesis methods, and properties of them, including advantages, disadvantages, and applications.

         <title>Oxidative Cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 Linkage in Lignin via Co Nanoparticles Embedded in 3DNG as Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 linkage in lignin is one of the key steps for oxidative conversion of lignin to low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight aromatics. Herein, we prepare Co nanoparticles embedded in three&#8208;dimensional network of nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene (Co/NG@3DNG&#8208;X) through immersion&#8208;pyrolysis procedure, in which X denotes the pyrolysis temperature. The detailed characterization of Co/NG@3DNG&#8208;X shows that the Co nanoparticles are coated with a few layers of nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene (NG) sheets that are further embedded in 3DNG matrix. The catalytic activities of the Co/NG@3DNG&#8208;X for the oxidative cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 linkage in lignin model compounds with O2 as oxidant are explored. It is demonstrated that catalytic activities of as&#8208;prepared Co/NG@3DNG&#8208;X can be tuned by varying the pyrolysis condition, and the Co/NG@3DNG&#8208;900 shows the highest catalytic activity, which is attributed to the enriched Co&#8208;Nx species, the strong surface basicity, and the mesoporous motif of 3DNG network. More pronouncedly, the Co/NG@3DNG&#8208;900 can also effectively catalyze the oxidative cleavage of organosolv lignin, generating certain monomeric aromatics. Additionally, the intrinsic magnetic property of Co nanoparticles makes the Co/NG@3DNG&#8208;X be easily recovered from the reaction mixture, and the as&#8208;coated thin NG layer can protect Co nanoparticle from oxidation condition, which putting together afford the Co/NG@3DNG&#8208;X with good reusability and stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Energy level, crystal morphology and fluorescence emission tuning in cocrystals via molecular&#8208;level engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic donor&#8208;acceptor complexes as new organic semiconductor class have attracted wide attention, due to their potential applications in functional optoelectronics. Herein, we present two new charge transfer cocrystals of di&#8208;cyanodiazafluorene (DCAF)&#8208;perylene (DCPE) and di&#8208;cyanodiazaflfluorene (DCAF)&#8208;pyrene (DCPY) through the rational cocrystal&#8208;engineering design. Although they are both 1:1 mixed stacking cocrystals with similar chemical structure, DCPE cocrystal possesses a non&#8208;centrosymmetric space group and narrower band gap compared to DPCY cocrystal, because of the non&#8208;covalent bonding variation. The electrostatic potential accumulated in the lateral facets leads to highly twisted nanobelts, and the strong H&#8208;aggregation causes fluorescence quenching. Meanwhile, the DCPY crystals with centrosymmetric space group and weaker intermolecular interactions show untwisted morphology and red emission. This study will be helpful for the design and understanding of functional cocrystal materials that can be used in flexible micro/nano&#8208;mechanics, mechanical energy, and optical devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Assembly of Helical Nanostructures: Solvent&#8208;Induced Morphology Transition and the Effect on Cell Adhesion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise manipulating both the morphology and chiroptical signals of supramolecular assemblies will help to better understand the natural biological self&#8208;assembly mechanism. Herein, two simple L/D&#8208;phenylalanine based derivatives (L/DPFM) are designed and their solvent&#8208;dependent morphology evolutions are illustrated. It is found that by increasing the content of H2O in the ethanol aqueous solutions, LPFM can self&#8208;assemble into right&#8208;handed nanofibers, flat fibrous structures and inversed left&#8208;handed nanofibers, respectively. The assemblies in ethanol and H2O exhibit opposite conformations and circular dichroism (CD) signals even though they are constructed from the same molecules. Thus, the morphology&#8208;dependent cell adhesion and proliferation behaviors are further characterized. Left&#8208;handed nanofibers are found to be more favorable for the cell adhesion compared with right&#8208;handed nanostructures. The quantitative AFM analysis showed that L929 cell adhesion force on left&#8208;handed LPFM fibers is much higher than that on structures with inversed handedness. Besides, the value of cell Young&#8217;s modulus is lower for left&#8208;handed nanofibrous films, which indicates better flexibility. The difference in cell&#8208;substrate interactions may lead to different effect on cell behaviors.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Coupling of Methane and Carbon Dioxide on Tantalum Cluster Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding molecular&#8208;scale reaction mechanisms is crucial for the design of modern catalysts with industrial prospect. Through joint experimental and computational studies, we investigate the direct coupling reaction of CH4 and CO2, two abundant greenhouse gases, mediated by Ta1,4+ ions to form larger oxygenated hydrocarbons. Coherent with proposed elementary steps, we expose products of CH4 dehydrogenation [Ta1,4CH2]+ to CO2 in a ring electrode ion trap. Product analysis and reaction kinetics indicate a predisposition of the tetramers for C&#8211;O coupling with a conversion to products of CH2O, whereas atomic cations enable C&#8211;C coupling yielding CH2CO. Many of the experimental findings are supported by thermodynamic computations, connecting structure, electronic properties, and catalyst function. Moreover, the study of bare Ta1,4+ compounds indicates that methane dehydrogenation is a significant initial step in the direct coupling reaction, enabling new, yet unknown reaction pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Particle Measurements: A Powerful Method for the Investigation of Electrochemical Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The relationship between interface structure (e.g. the facet of the solid phase and the configuration of solvation) and the reactivity of corresponding electrode is a critical issue in electrochemistry. Compared to macroscopic electrode measurements, electrochemical methods established on the single&#8208;particle scale have advantages in establishing the structure&#8208;property relationship. In recent years, great achievements have been made in the electrochemical energy storage and electrocatalysis for understanding the evolution and kinetics of electrodes by employing single&#8208;particle measurements. This concept aims to provide an overview of the update of single&#8208;particle measurements in the related electrochemical processes. Furthermore, the challenges and prospects for the development and application of single&#8208;particle measurements are also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Next Generation Copper Mediators for the Efficient Production of 18F&#8208;Labeled Aromatics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Evaluation of a series of Cu(II) complexes revealed several highly efficient mediators for radiofluorination of aryl boronic and stannyl substrates. After optimization of the reaction conditions, their application enabled preparation of seven PET&#8208;tracers in improved radiochemical yields and/or using significantly lower precursor loadings.







Abstract
Cu&#8208;mediated radiofluorination is a versatile tool for the preparation of 18F&#8208;labeled (hetero)aromatics. In this work, we systematically evaluated a series of complexes and identified several generally applicable mediators for highly efficient radiofluorination of aryl boronic and stannyl substrates. Utilization of these mediators in nBuOH/DMI or DMI significantly improved 18F&#8208;labeling yields despite use of lower precursor amounts. Impressively, application of 2.5&#8197;&#956;mol aryl boronic acids was sufficient to achieve 18F&#8208;labeling yields of up to 75&#8201;%. The practicality of the novel mediators was demonstrated by efficient production of five PET&#8208;tracers and transfer of the method to an automated radiosynthesis module. In addition, (S)&#8208;3&#8208;[18F]FPhe and 6&#8208;[18F]FDOPA were prepared in activity yields of 23&#177;1&#8201;% and 30&#177;3&#8201;% using only 2.5&#8197;&#956;mol of the corresponding boronic acid or trimethylstannyl precursor.

         <title>A Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter Investigated by Time&#8208;Resolved Near&#8208;Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free TADF (thermally activated delayed fluorescence) emitter was investigated by time&#8208;resolved near&#8208;infrared spectroscopy. This enabled upper excited states that contribute to spin&#8208;vibronic coupling to be detected.







Abstract
Emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) require small singlet (S1)&#8208;triplet (T1) energy gaps as well as fast intersystem crossing (ISC) transitions. These transitions can be mediated by vibronic mixing with higher excited states Sn and Tn (n=2, 3, 4, &#8230;). For a prototypical TADF emitter consisting of a triarylamine and a dicyanobenzene moiety (TAA&#8208;DCN) it is shown that these higher states can be located energetically by time&#8208;resolved near&#8208;infrared (NIR) spectroscopy.
