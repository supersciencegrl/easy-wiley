      <title>Synthetic Approaches to Triarylboranes from 1885 to 2020</title>
      <dc:description>In recent years, research in the fields of optoelectronics, anion sensors and bioimaging agents have been greatly influenced by novel compounds containing triarylborane motifs. Such compounds possess an empty p&#8208;orbital at boron which results in useful optical and electronic properties. Such a diversity of applications was not expected when the first triarylborane was reported in 1885. Synthetic approaches to triarylboranes underwent various changes over the following century, some of which are still used in the present day, such as the generally applicable routes developed by Krause  et al  . in 1922, or by Grisdale  et al  . in 1972 at Eastman Kodak. Some other developments were not pursued further after their initial reports, such as the synthesis of two triarylboranes bearing three different aromatic groups by Mikhailov  et al  . in 1958. This review summarizes the development of synthetic approaches to triarylboranes from their first report nearly 135 years ago to the present.</dc:description>

      <title>Computational insight into the different mechanisms of Ag&#8208;, Cu&#8208;, and Pd&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation of alkenes and sulfonyl hydrazones</title>
      <dc:description>The [2+1] cycloaddition reaction of a metal carbene with an alkene can produce important cyclopropane products for synthesis intermediates, material and pharmaceutical applications. However, this reaction is often accompanied by side reactions such as coupling and self&#8208;coupling, so that the yield of cyclopropanation product of non&#8208;silver transition metal carbene and hindered alkene is generally lower than 50%. To solve this problem, addition of a low concentration of diazo compound (decomposition of sulfonyl hydrazones) to alkene catalyzed by either CuOAc or PdCl  2  was studied but side reactions still could not be avoided. Interestingly, however, the yield of cyclopropanation for such hindered alkenes was as high as 99% with AgOTf as catalyst. To explain this unexpected phenomenon, reaction pathways have been computed for four different catalysts using density functional theory (DFT). By combining the results of these calculations with the experimental ones, we concluded that the efficiency of the silver catalyst is due to the barrierless concerted cycloaddition step, and the kinetic inhibition of side reaction by a high concentration of alkene.</dc:description>

      <title>Cations and Anions of Dibenzo[a,e]pentalene and Reduction of a Dibenzo[a,e]pentalenophane</title>
      <dc:description>Dibenzo[a,e]pentalene (DBP) is a non&#8208;alternant conjugated hydrocarbon with antiaromatic character and ambipolar electrochemical behavior. Upon both reduction and oxidation, it becomes aromatic. We herein study the chemical oxidation and reduction of a planar DBP derivative and a bent DBP&#8208;phane. The molecular structures of its planar dication, cation radical and anion radical in the solid state demonstrate the gained aromaticity through bond length equalization, which is supported by nucleus independent chemical shift&#8208;calculations. EPR spectra on the cation radical confirm the spin delocalization over the DBP framework. A similar delocalization was not possible in the reduced bent DBP&#8208;phane, which stabilized itself by proton abstraction from a solvent molecule upon reduction. This is the first report on structures of a DBP cation radical and dication in the solid state and of a reduced bent DBP derivative. Our study provides valuable insight into the charged species of DBP for its application as semiconductor.</dc:description>

      <title>An Electron&#8208;Accepting aza&#8208;BODIPY&#8208;Based Donor&#8211;Acceptor&#8211;Donor Architecture for Bright NIR Emission</title>
      <dc:description>A bright near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent molecule was developed based on the donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) approach using an aza&#8208;BODIPY analog called pyrrolopyrrole aza&#8208;BODIPY (PPAB) as an electron&#8208;accepting chromophore. Directly introducing electron&#8208;donating triphenylamine (TPA) to elaborate a D&#8211;A&#8211;D structure caused redshifts of absorption and emission of PPAB into the NIR region with the enhanced fluorescence brightness up to 0.5&#160;&#215;&#160;105&#160;M&#8211;1cm&#8211;1, whereas inserting a phenylene linker between the TPA donor and PPAB acceptor induced solvatochromic behaviors in emission. The transient absorption spectra and theoretical calculations revealed the presence of a highly emissive hybridized locally excited and charge&#8208;transfer state in the former case and the contribution of the dark charge&#8208;separated state to the excited state in the latter case. The bright D&#8211;A&#8211;D PPAB as a novel emitter resulted in a NIR electroluminescence with a high external quantum efficiency of 3.7% and a low amplified spontaneous emission threshold of ca. 80&#160;&#956;J cm&#8211;2, indicating the high potential for NIR optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Herein, the photodynamic activity of phthalocyanine&#8208;assembled nanoparticles against bacterial strains is demonstrated. The photosensitizers (PS) studied in this work are two chiral Zn(II)Pcs (PS&#8208;1 and PS&#8208;2), with an AABB geometry (where A and B refer to differently substituted isoindole constituents) containing differently functionalized, chiral binaphthyloxy&#8208;linked A isoindole units, which determine the hydrophobicity of the system, and cationic methyl pyridinium moieties in the other two isoindoles to embody hydrophilicity. Both compounds have the ability to self&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles in water media and have proved efficient in the photoinactivation of S. aureus and E. coli, selected as models of Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. The size average of the nanoparticles is determined by the substitution at the binaphthyl core and, in turn, it influences the toxicity of the PS. Thus, PS&#8208;1, presenting a non&#8208;substituted binaphthyl core, forms larger nanoparticles with a larger cationic surface than octyl&#8208;functionalized PS&#8208;2. Although both PS present similar structure and photophysical features, the self&#8208;assembled nanostructures of PS&#8208;1 are more effective in killing both types of strains, showing an outstanding photoinactivation capacity with the Gram&#8208;negative E. coli.</dc:description>

      <title>Photoswitchable Fluorescent Self&#8208;Assembled Metallacycles with High Photostability</title>
      <dc:description>In this study, photoswitchable fluorescent supramolecular metallacycles with high fatigue&#8208;resistance have been constructed by coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly by using bithienylethene with dipyridyl units (  BTE  ) as a donor and a fluorescent di&#8208;platinum(II) (  Pt&#8208;F  ) as an acceptor. The photo&#8208;triggered reversible transformation between the ring&#8208;open and ring&#8208;closed form of the metallacycles was confirmed by  1  H NMR,  31  P NMR, and UV&#8208;Vis spectra. This unique property enables a reversible noninvasive &#8220;off&#8208;on&#8221; switching of fluorescence through efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET). Importantly, the metallacycles remains structural intact after up to 10 photoswitching cycles. In summary, the photoresponsive property and exceptional photostability of the metallacycles posit their potential promising application in optical switching, image storage, and super&#8208;resolution microscopy.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this study, photoswitchable fluorescent supramolecular metallacycles with high fatigue&#8208;resistance have been constructed by coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly by using bithienylethene with dipyridyl units (  BTE  ) as a donor and a fluorescent di&#8208;platinum(II) (  Pt&#8208;F  ) as an acceptor. The photo&#8208;triggered reversible transformation between the ring&#8208;open and ring&#8208;closed form of the metallacycles was confirmed by  1  H NMR,  31  P NMR, and UV&#8208;Vis spectra. This unique property enables a reversible noninvasive &#8220;off&#8208;on&#8221; switching of fluorescence through efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET). Importantly, the metallacycles remains structural intact after up to 10 photoswitching cycles. In summary, the photoresponsive property and exceptional photostability of the metallacycles posit their potential promising application in optical switching, image storage, and super&#8208;resolution microscopy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Bambusuril Macrocycles as Mediators of Supramolecular Interactions: Application to the Europium Cage Helicate</title>
      <dc:description>Here we show how bambusurils can be used for tuning and/or characterizing supramolecular systems. Indeed, the addition of bambusurils as anion scavengers to metal&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assemblies allows manipulating the subtle equilibria in the given system. We demonstrate this for the case of tetranuclear europium helical cage that is well suited to different applications. Among the reported results, we bring the experimental evidence that perchlorate and triflate anions act as a molecular template for the cage assembly. The complexation of inorganic anions with neutral bambusurils resulted in bulky noncoordinating counterions that may trigger self&#8208;assembly process or stimulate specific interactions between components. Moreover, bambusuril was able to selectively remove coordinating nitrates from the mixture with noncoordinating anions enabling the regeneration of the helical cage.</dc:description>

      <title>Photoinduced DNA Interstrand Cross&#8208;linking by 1,1'&#8208;Biphenyl Analogues: Substituents and Leaving Groups Combine to Determine the Efficiency of Cross&#8208;Linker</title>
      <dc:description>Two series of 1,1'&#8208;biphenyl analogues with various leaving groups (L = OAc, OCH  3  , OCHCH=CH  2  , OCH  2  Ph, SPh, SePh, and Ph  3  P  +  ) were synthesized. Their reactivity towards DNA and the reaction mechanism were investigated by determining DNA interstrand cross&#8208;link (ICL) efficiency, radical and carbocation formation, and the cross&#8208;linking reaction sites. All compounds induced DNA ICL formation upon 350 nm irradiation via a carbocation that was generated from oxidation of the corresponding free radicals. The ICL efficiency and the reaction rate strongly depend on the combined effect of the leaving group and the substituent. Among all compounds tested, the high ICL efficiency (30&#8208;43%) and fast reaction rate were observed with compounds carrying a nitrophenyl group and acetate (  2a)  , ether (  2b  and  2c)  , or triphenylphosphonium salt (  2g  ) as leaving groups. Most compounds with a 4&#8208;methoxybenzene group showed similar DNA ICL efficiency (&#8764; 30%) with a slow DNA cross&#8208;linking reaction rate. Both cation trapping and free radical trapping adducts were detected in the photo activation process of these compounds, which provided direct evidence for the proposed mechanism. Heat stability study in combination with sequence study suggested that these photo&#8208;generated benzyl cations alkylate DNA at dG, dA, and dC sites.</dc:description>

      <title>Prediction of Spin Density, Baird&#8208;Antiaromaticity, and Singlet&#8208;Triplet Energy Gap in Triplet&#8208;State Polybenzenoid Systems from Simple Structural Motifs</title>
      <dc:description>Triplet&#8208;state aromaticity has been recently proposed as a strategy for designing functional organic electronic compounds, many of which are polycyclic aromatic systems. However, in many cases, the aromatic nature of the triplet state cannot be easily predicted. Moreover, it is often unclear how specific structural manipulations affect the electronic properties of the excited state compounds. Herein, we study the relationship between the structure of polybenzenoid hydrocarbons (PBHs) and their spin density distribution and aromatic character in the first triplet excited state. Though a direct link is not immediately visible, classifying the PBHs according to their annulation sequence reveals regularities. Based on these, we define a set of guidelines to qualitatively predict the location of spin and paratropicity and the singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap in larger PBHs, using only their smaller tri&#8208; and tetracyclic components and subsequently test the validity of the guidelines on larger systems.</dc:description>

      <title>Beyond the Isoprene Pattern: Bifunctional Polyene Cyclizations</title>
      <dc:description>Polyene cyclizations are capable of producing molecular complexity in a single step. While classical systems are limited to simple alkyl substitution patterns only, bifunctional polyenes take advantage of the unique reactivity of higher&#8208;functionalized alkenes. Here, we highlight the potential of these variants for the synthesis of structurally complex polycycles involving unprecedented termination steps. We also want to provide a stimulus for the development of novel modes of cyclization that involve bifunctional units to enable efficient synthesis of yet inaccessible natural products.</dc:description>

      <title>Intramolecular Pyridinium Oxide Cycloadditions:&#160; Systematic Study of Substitution, Diastereoselectivity, and Regioselectivity</title>
      <dc:description>Intramolecular pyridinium oxide cycloadditions form complex polycyclic nitrogenous architectures. The diastereoselectivity and regioselectivity of pyridinium oxide cycloadditions was systematically investigated for the first time using complex substrates. Predictably high levels of diastereoselectivity and regioselectivity are observed, which can be attributed to minimization of steric (syn&#8208;pentane) and torsional strain in the products.&#160; The reaction is reversible under the reaction conditions, and it is stereospecific with respect to dipolarophile geometry.</dc:description>

      <title>Proanthocyanins&#8208;capped biogenic TiO2 nanoparticles with enhanced penetration, antibacterial and ROS mediated inhibition of bacteria proliferation and biofilm formation: A comparative approach</title>
      <dc:description>The biofunctionalized TiO2 NPs, having a size range of 18.42 &#177; 1.3 nm were synthesized employing single step approach employing Grape seed extract (GSE) mediated proanthocyanins (PACs) polyphenols. The present study purposes to examine the effect of PACs rich GSE corona on (i) the stability and dispersity of&#160;GSE&#8208;TiO  2  &#8208;NPs, their (ii) anti&#8208;proliferative and anti&#8208;biofilm efficacy and (iii) propensity of internalization and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in  P. aeruginosa  and&#160;  S. saprophyticus  strains. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques were used to validate NPs formation. The comparative FTIR spectral analysis demonstrated that PACs linked functional &#8208;OH groups likely played a central role in Ti  4+  reduction, nucleation, formation and stability of&#160;GSE&#8208;TiO  2  &#8208;NPs.&#160;The TEM&#160;and ICP&#8208;MS&#160;analyses confirmed there was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) enhanced intracellular uptake of GSE&#8208;TiO  2  &#8208;NPs in tested uropathogens as compare to bare TiO  2  &#8208;NPs. Correspondingly, compared to bare NPs, GSE&#8208;TiO  2  &#8208;NPs induced intracellular ROS formation that corresponded well with dose&#8208;dependent inhibitory patterns of cell proliferation and biofilm formation in both the tested strains. Overall, this study demonstrates that &#8208;OH rich PACs of GSE corona on biogenic TiO  2  &#8208;NPs maximized the functional stability, dispersity and propensity of penetration into planktonic cells and biofilm matrices; albeit, such unique merits warranted the GSE&#8208;TiO  2  &#8208;NPs as a novel, functionally stable and efficient antibacterial nanoformulation to combat with UTIs menace in clinical settings</dc:description>

      <title>Total Synthesis of Tiacumicin B: Study of the Challenging &#946;&#8208;Selective Glycosylations</title>
      <dc:description>We report here a full account of the total synthesis of tiacumicin B (Tcn&#8208;B), a natural glycosylated macrolide with remarkable

antibiotic properties. Our strategy is based on our experience with the synthesis of the tiacumicin B aglycone and on unique 1,2&#8208;  cis  &#8208;glycosylation steps. It features the conclusive use of sulfoxide anomeric leaving&#8208;groups in combination with a remote 3&#8208;  O  &#8208;picoloyl group on the donors allowing highly b&#8208;selective rhamnosylation and noviosylation that rely on H&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated Aglycone Delivery (HAD). The rhamnosylated C1&#8208;C3 fragment was anchored to the C4&#8208;C19 aglycone fragment by a Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling. Ring&#8208;size selective Shiina macrolactonization provided a semi&#8208;glycosylated aglycone that was engaged directly in the noviolysation step with a virtually total &#946;&#8208;selectivity. Finally, a novel deprotection method was devised for the removal of a 2&#8208;naphthylmethyl (Nap) ether on a phenol and efficient removal of all the protecting groups provided synthetic tiacumicin B.</dc:description>

      <title>Tuning the regioselective functionalization of trifluoromethylated dienes via lanthanum&#8208;mediated single C&#8208;F bond activation</title>
      <dc:description>The development of new fluorine containing building blocks and their efficient synthetic access is currently a challenging research field. We herein present the highly regio and stereoselective addition of a large range of aldehydes onto trifluoromethylated benzofulvenes using a simple La/I  2  /DIBAL&#8208;Cl system via a selective C&#8208;F bond activation process. This versatile methodology provides homodienyl alcohols bearing a terminal CF  2  &#8208;alkene with potential further applications, as shown by the dehydration to the first benzofulvenes carrying a difluorovinyl group. In addition, for certain electron&#8208;poor aldehydes, unprecedented ipso substitution of the CF  3  group in a diene has been observed, which according to DFT studies, is related to the presence of the large, Lewis acidic lanthanum metal.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>
Self&#8208;propelled micromotors with a reversible braking system are shown. Manganese ions are embedded in microporous silica nanoparticles to catalyse the degradation of the H2O2 &#8220;fuel&#8221; to water and gaseous oxygen. The bubbles formation propels the microparticles in a rapid forward&#8208;thrusting motion. The micromotors are decorated with thermoresponsive polyphosphazenes which expand/collapse in a temperature&#8208;driven response to regulate the flow of fuel to the motor and thus control their velocity.

     alt="Reversible Speed Regulation of Self&#8208;Propelled Janus Micromotors via Thermoresponsive Bottle&#8208;Brush Polymers"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Self&#8208;propelled micromotors&lt;/b&gt; with a reversible braking system are shown. Manganese ions are embedded in microporous silica nanoparticles to catalyse the degradation of the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &#8220;fuel&#8221; to water and gaseous oxygen. The bubbles formation propels the microparticles in a rapid forward&#8208;thrusting motion. The micromotors are decorated with thermoresponsive polyphosphazenes which expand/collapse in a temperature&#8208;driven response to regulate the flow of fuel to the motor and thus control their velocity. More information can be found in the Communication by I.&#8197;Teasdale, Y.&#8197;Salinas, et&#8197;al.

      <title>Decorating Metal Nitrate with Coplanar Bipyridine Moiety: a Simple and General Method for Fabricating Photochromic Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>As a significant branch of photochromic materials, crystalline hybrid photochromic materials (CHPMs) have obtained widespread attention of researchers because of their possibilities of generating other photo&#8208;responsive properties and advantages in understanding the underlying relationship between structure and photo&#8208;responsive performance. The predesign of suitable ligands play a major role in generating desirable CHPMs. Hitherto, most of CHPMs are built from photo&#8208;deformable or photo&#8208;responsive tectons. However, the synthesis of these ligands is usually time&#8208;consuming and high&#8208;cost, which greatly restrict their large&#8208;scale preparation and practical application. Therefore, it is necessary and meaningful to explore new families of CHPMs compared with the existing CHPMs. Herein, we report a simple and general method for constructing CHPMs via decorating metal nitrate with coplanar bipyridine moiety 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (phen). The resulting products exhibit apparent photo&#8208;coloration in response to Xe&#8208;lamp irradiation. The electron&#8208;transfer (ET) from the coplanar NO  3  &#8208;  species (as &#960;&#8208;electron donors, &#960;&#8208;EDs) to coplanar phen moieties (as &#960;&#8208;electron acceptors, &#960;&#8208;EAs) is responsible for the resulting photochromism. The influence of coordination environment and central metal ions on photochromism have also been studied. Our work has demonstrated that the introduction of coplanar organic tectons as &#960;&#8208;EAs to metal nitrate as &#960;&#8208;EDs under the collaboration of ET and coordination assembly strategies is a simple and general method to manufacture CHPMs.</dc:description>

      <title>Proton Switch in the Secondary Coordination Sphere to Control Catalytic Events at the Metal Center: Biomimetic Oxo Transfer Chemistry of Nickel Amidate Complex</title>
      <dc:description>High&#8208;valent metal&#8211;oxo species are key intermediates for the oxygen atom transfer step in the catalytic cycles of many metalloenzymes. While the redox&#8208;active metal centers of such enzymes are typically supported by anionic amino acid side chains or porphyrin rings, peptide backbone itself might function as strong electron&#8208;donating ligands to stabilize high oxidation states. To test the feasibility of this idea in synthetic settings, we have prepared a nickel(II) complex of new amido multidentate ligand. The mononuclear nickel complex of this N5 ligand catalyzes epoxidation reactions of a wide range of olefins by using mCPBA as a terminal oxidant. Notably, a remarkably high catalytic efficiency and selectivity were observed for terminal olefin substrates. We found that protonation of the secondary coordination sphere serves as the entry point to the catalytic cycle, in which high&#8208;valent nickel species is subsequently formed to carry out oxo&#8208;transfer reactions. Conceptually parallel process could allow metalloenzymes to control the catalytic cycle in the primary coordination sphere by using proton switch in the secondary coordination sphere.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis and Electronic Properties of Directly Linked Dihydrodiazatetracene Dimers</title>
      <dc:description>In this work, we synthesized three types of 5,12&#8208;dihydro&#8208;5,12&#8208;diazatetracene (DHDAT) dimers with different substitution patterns: a symmetric dimer with a C&#8211;C bond between the monomer units (  1  ) and two asymmetric dimers with a C&#8211;N bond between the monomer units (  2  and  3  ). The structure&#8208;property relationship of  1  &#8211;  3  were investigated. X&#8208;ray single crystal structure analysis revealed that the two DHDAT units are completely planar in the C&#8211;C linked dimer  1  whereas the monomer units are perpendicularly oriented in the C&#8211;N linked dimers  2  and  3  in the crystals. Reflecting their molecular structures, the electronic interaction between the two monomer units is larger in  1  and very little in  2  and  3  in the ground states. However, the emission behavior of  3  is remarkably different from those of other dimers and its monomer. The dimer  3  shows a clear positive solvatochromism in emission which is characteristic for electron donor&#8211;acceptor type molecules in spite of its donor&#8211;donor type structure. Furthermore, the dimer  3  exhibits a unique multi&#8208;step thermochromic emission behavior. The reason for the different emission behaviors can be attributed to the asymmetric distributions of the HOMO and LUMO of DHDAT.</dc:description>

      <title>Selective cross&#8208;coupling of unsaturated substrates on Al(I)</title>
      <dc:description>The Al(I) compound NacNacAl ( 1 , NacNac = [ArNC(Me)CHC(Me)NAr] &#8210; , Ar = 2,6&#8208; i Pr 2 C 6 H 3 ) serves as a template for the chemoselective coupling between carbonyls (benzophenone, fenchone, isophorone, p &#8208;tolyl benzoate, N,N &#8208;dimethyl benzamide, (1&#8208;phenylethylidene)aniline) and pyridine. With the CH&#8208;acidic ketone (1R)&#8208;(+) camphor, the reaction affords a hydrido alkoxide compound of Al, formed as the result of enolization, whereas an enolizable imine, (1&#8208;phenylethylidene)aniline, and the bulky ketone isophorone, still chemoselectively couple with pyridine. In contrast, reaction with the ester p &#8208;tolyl benzoate results in cleavage of the ester bond together with replacement of the alkoxy group by a hydrogen atom of the pyridine moiety.

      <title>Tuning tetrazole photochemistry for protein ligation and molecular imaging</title>
      <dc:description>Photochemistry provides a wide range of alternative reagents that hold potential for use in bimolecular functionalisation of proteins. Here, we report the synthesis and characterisation of metal ion binding chelates derivatised with disubstituted tetrazoles for the photoradiochemical labelling of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). The photophysical properties of tetrazoles&#160;featuring extended aromatic systems and auxochromic substituents&#160;to tune excitation toward longer wavelengths (365 and 395 nm) were studied. Two photoactivatable chelates based on desferrioxamine B (DFO) and theaza&#8208;macrocycle NODAGA were functionalised with a tetrazole and developed for protein labelling with&#160;89Zr,&#160;64Cu and&#160;68Ga radionuclides.&#160;DFO&#8208;tetrazole (1) was assessed by direct conjugation to formulated trastuzumab and subsequent radiolabelling with&#160;89Zr. Radiochemical studies and cellular&#8208;based assays demonstrated that the radiotracer remained stable&#160;in vitro&#160;and retained high immunoreactivity. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and biodistribution studies were used to measure the tumour specific uptake and pharmacokinetic profile in mice bearing human SK&#8208;OV&#8208;3 ovarian cancer xenografts. Experiments demonstrate that tetrazole&#8208;based photochemistry is a viable approach for the light&#8208;induced synthesis of PET radiotracers.</dc:description>

      <title>The Simplest Model for Doped PEDOT (Poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene)): Single&#8208;crystalline EDOT Dimer Radical Cation Salts</title>

Band calculations identified 1D metallic band structures with a strong intracolumnar orbital interaction (band width&#160; W&#160; ~ 1 eV), implying the origin of the high conductivity of doped PEDOT. Interestingly, the salts exhibited semiconducting behavior reminiscent of genuine Mott states as a result of electron&#8211;electron repulsion ( U ) dominant over&#160; W .

      <dc:description>
Rolling up: Larger acenes are potential carriers of diffuse interstellar bands, and should undergo dehydrogenation reactions upon absorption of interstellar UV photons. This could result in 2,3&#8208;didehydroacenes that have a reactive aryne functionality at one of the short ends of the long molecule. The intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder reaction to dihydroethenocyclacenes with the other end of the acene and the subsequent cycloreversion of acetylene were studied computationally and were shown to have energy requirements that are compatible with cyclacene formation under the extreme conditions of interstellar space.

      <dc:description>2,3&#8208;Diarylbenzo[  b  ]arsoles were synthesized from zirconacycles and diiodophenylarsine. The structural modification to the luminophore was attained through diarylacetylene precursors, Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling, and oxidation of the arsenic atom. The emission properties were controlled according to these modifications. The 2,3&#8208;diarylbenzo[  b  ]arsoles showed aggregation induced emission enhancement; the stronger emission was observed in the solid states than in solutions. In addition, Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura polycondensation and olefin metathesis polymerization produced main&#8208; and side&#8208;chain polymers, respectively. The resultant polymers showed different emission behaviors such as aggregation caused quenching and aggregation induced emission enhancement.</dc:description>

      <title>Carbohydrate Derived Metal Chelator&#8208;Triggered Lipids for Liposomal Drug Delivery</title>
      <dc:description>Liposomes are versatile three&#8208;dimensional, biomaterial based frameworks that can spatially enclose a variety of organic and inorganic biomaterial for advanced targeted delivery applications. Implementation of external stimuli controlled release of their cargo will significantly augment their wide application for liposomal drug delivery. In this paper, we present the synthesis of a carbohydrate derived lipid, capable of changing its conformation depending on Zn2+ presence: an active state in the presence of Zn2+ ions and back to an inactive state in the absence of Zn2+ or when exposed to Na2EDTA, a metal chelator with high affinity for Zn2+ ions. This is to our knowledge the first report of a lipid triggered by the presence of a metal chelator. Using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy and a single liposome study, we found that it indeed was possible for the lipid to be incorporated into the bilayer of stable liposomes that remained leakage free for the fluorescent cargo of the liposomes. Upon addition of EDTA to the liposomes, their fluorescent cargo could be released as a result of the membrane incorporated lipids undergoing a conformational change.</dc:description>

      <title>Mo2C/Reduced Graphene Oxide Composites with Enhanced Electrocatalytic Activity and Biocompatibility for Microbial Fuel Cells</title>
      <dc:description>A simple, cost&#8208;effective strategy was developed to effectively improve the electron transfer efficiency as well as the power output of microbial fuel cells (MFCs) by decorating the commercial carbon paper (CP) anode with an advanced Mo  2  C/reduced graphene oxide (Mo  2  C/RGO) composite. Benefiting from the synergistic effects of the superior electrocatalytic activity of Mo  2  C, the high surface area, and prominent conductivity of RGO, the MFC equipped with this Mo  2  C/RGO composite yields a remarkable output power density of 1747&#177;37.6 mW m  &#8208;2  , which is considerably higher than that of carbon paper MFC (CP&#8208;MFC) (926.8&#177;6.3) mW m  &#8208;2  ). Importantly, the composite also facilitates the formation of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) hybrid biofilm and could effectively improve the bacteria&#8211;electrode interaction. These features result in an enhanced coulombic efficiency up 13.2%, nearly one order of magnitude higher than that of the CP (1.2%).</dc:description>

      <title>Halogen Complexes of Anionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
      <dc:description>
Iodine complexes of anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHC) act as electrophiles towards a variety of nucleophiles, with the interactions ranging from noncovalent charge&#8208;transfer or halogen bonding to covalent 3&#8208;center, 4&#8208;electron bonding. Hypervalent (10&#8208;X&#8208;2) bis(carbene)iodine(I) and &#8208;bromine(I) complexes could be isolated and structurally characterized, and computational studies reveal that London dispersion involving the bulky NHC ligands (R=Dipp, Mes) contributes significantly to the stability of these systems.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Iodine complexes of anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes&lt;/b&gt; (NHC) act as electrophiles towards a variety of nucleophiles, with the interactions ranging from noncovalent charge&#8208;transfer or halogen bonding to covalent 3&#8208;center, 4&#8208;electron bonding. Hypervalent (10&#8208;X&#8208;2) bis(carbene)iodine(I) and &#8208;bromine(I) complexes could be isolated and structurally characterized, and computational studies reveal that London dispersion involving the bulky NHC ligands (R=Dipp, Mes) contributes significantly to the stability of these systems.

      <title>Zr&#8208;MOF&#8208;808 as Catalyst for Amide Esterification</title>
      <dc:description>
Amide is one of the most robust groups, characterized by extreme inertness, represented here as laying in a hammock on the beach. Consequently, it will take ages to go up to the mountain together with butanol in the endeavor to get to the other side to become an ester. However, they can take the shortcut of a Zr&#8208;MOF&#8208;808&#8208;P catalyst (FESEM image), represented as a cave, which facilitates reaching the plateau on the other side of the mountain. More information can be found in the Full Paper by P. Garc&#237;a&#8208;Garc&#237;a, A. Corma, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202003752).

      <title>Inversion Symmetry Breaking in Order&#8211;Disorder Transitions of Globular Ligands Coordinating to Cobalt(II) and Nickel(II) Bisacetylacetonato Complexes During Heating</title>
      <dc:description>
Chirality generated by rotational motions: Unexpected inversion&#8208;symmetry breaking was observed in the order&#8211;disorder phase transitions of [M(acac)2(abco)2] (M=Co2+ and Ni2+) during heating. X&#8208;ray structure analysis and differential scanning calorimetry measurements revealed that the 60&#176; step rotating disordering of the globular abco ligands induced local pseudo&#8208;symmetry to increase from trigonal to hexagonal, and the crystal symmetries were lowered to reduce the steric repulsion among them. More information can be found in the Full Paper by N. Hoshino and T. Akutagawa. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202004492).

      <title>Dual Crosslinking Photo&#8208;Switches for Orthogonal Photo&#8208;Control of Hybridization Between Serinol Nucleic Acid and RNA</title>
      <dc:description>
A dual photo&#8208;switch method produces four different hybridization states of duplexes by irradiation with a specific wavelength of light: 465&#8197;nm, 405&#8197;nm, 340&#8197;nm, and 300&#8197;nm. This photo&#8208;regulation system is based on a reversible photo&#8208;crosslinking reaction between two photo&#8208;responsive nucleobases in serinol nucleic acid strands. The use of a different pair of the photo&#8208;responsive nucleobases realizes an orthogonal photo&#8208;control of two duplexes. More information can be found in the Full Paper by Y. Yamano, K. Murayama, and H. Asanuma. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202003528).

A large entropy of proton solvation was used for thermoelectric conversion. A [Ru(Him)6] complex produces 3.7&#8197;mV at a temperature difference of 1&#8197;K. This ruthenium complex exhibits a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer reaction and releases protons associated with the redox reaction.

      <title>A Light&#8208;Harvesting/Charge&#8208;Separation Model with Energy Gradient Made of Assemblies of meta&#8208;Pyridyl Zinc Porphyrins</title>
      <dc:description>
A light&#8208;harvesting antenna model made of three mutually axially coordinated zinc porphyrin molecules is reported in this work. With an energy gradient incorporated, energy transfer only occurs from porphyrin molecules specializing in light absorption to a porphyrin molecule as a charge separation center. The latter molecule is a directly linked porphyrin/ferrocene dyad. The image implies that the light energy is funneled into the lower energy porphyrin/ferrocene dyad with no unfavorable back energy transfer. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J. Otsuki et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202003327).

      <title>Temperature dependence of 1 H paramagnetic chemical shifts in actinide complexes, beyond Bleaney&#8217;s theory. The AnVIO22+ &#8722; DPA complexes (An = Np, Pu) as an example.</title>
      <dc:description>Actinide +VI complexes (An VI = U VI , Np VI and Pu VI ) with

dipicolinic acid derivatives were synthesized and characterized by

powder XRD, SQUID magnetometry and NMR spectroscopy. In

addition, Np VI and Pu VI complexes were described by first principles

CAS based and two&#8208;component spin&#8208;restricted DFT methods. The

analysis of the 1 H paramagnetic NMR chemical shifts for all protons

of the ligands according to the X&#8208;rays structures shows that the

Fermi contact contribution is negligible. The magnetic susceptibility

tensor is determined by combining SQUID, pNMR shifts and Evans&#8217;

method. The SO&#8208;RASPT2 results fit well the experimental magnetic

susceptibility and pNMR chemical shifts. The role of the counterions

in the solid phase is pointed out; their presence impacts the magnetic

properties of the Np VI complex. The temperature dependence of the

pNMR chemical shifts has a strong 1 &#8260; T contribution, contrarily to

Bleaney&#8217;s theory for lanthanide complexes. The fitting of the

temperature dependence of the pNMR chemical shifts and SQUID

magnetic susceptibility by a two&#8208;Kramers&#8208;doublet model for the Np VI

complex and a non&#8208;Kramers&#8208;doublet model for the Pu VI complex

allows for the experimental evaluation of energy gaps and magnetic

moments of the paramagnetic center.</dc:description>

      <title>Amorphous Boron Dispersed LaCoO3 with Large Oxygen Vacancies for Efficient Catalytic Propane Oxidation</title>
      <dc:description>Unsatisfied oxygen mobility is a considerable barrier to the development of perovskite for the&#160;low&#8208;temperature volatile organic compounds (VOCs) oxidation. This work introduced small amounts of dispersed non&#8208;metal boron into LaCoO  3  &#160;crystal via an easy sol&#8208;gel method to create more oxygen defects, that are conducive to the catalytic performance of propane (C  3  H  8  ) oxidation. It reveals that moderate addition of boron successfully induces high&#160;distortion of LaCoO  3  &#160;crystal, decreases the perovskite particle size, and produces large proportion of bulk Co  2+  &#160;species corresponding to abundant oxygen vacancies. Besides, surface Co  3+  &#160;species, as the acid sites, that are active for cleaving C&#8208;H bond of C  3  H  8  &#160;molecule are enriched. As a result, the LCB&#8208;7 (molar ratio of Co: B = 0.93: 0.07) displays the best C  3  H  8  &#160;oxidation activity. Simultaneously, the above catalyst exhibits superior thermal stability against CO  2  &#160;and H  2  O for a lasting 200 h. This work provides a new strategy for modifying the catalytic VOCs oxidation performance of perovskites via the regulation&#160;of amorphous boron&#8208;dispersion.</dc:description>

      <title>Multi&#8208;functional, Low Symmetry Pd2L4 Nanocage Libraries</title>
      <dc:description>Although many impressive metallo&#8208;supramolecular architectures have been reported, they tend towards high symmetry structures and avoid extraneous functionality to ensure high&#8208;fidelity in the self&#8208;assembly process. This minimalist approach, however, limits the range of accessible structures and thus their potential applications. Herein is described the synthesis of a family of ditopic ligands wherein the ligand scaffolds are both low symmetry and incorporate exohedral functional moieties. Key to this design is the use of CuAAC chemistry, as the triazole is capable of acting as both a coordinating heterocycle and a tether between the ligand framework and functional unit simultaneously. A common precursor was used to generate ligands with various functionalities, allowing control of electronic properties, whilst maintaining the core structure of the resultant cis&#8208;Pd2L4 nanocage assemblies. The isostructural nature of the scaffold frameworks enabled formation of combinatorial libraries from the self&#8208;assembly of ligand mixtures, generating a statistical mixture of multi&#8208;functional, low symmetry architectures.</dc:description>

      <title>A robust mesoporous Al2O3 based nanocomposite catalyst for abundant NOx storage with rational design of Pt and Ba species</title>

      <title>Sensitive and visual detection of phosgene by a TICT&#8208;based BODIPY dye with 8&#8208;(o&#8208;hydroxy)aniline as the active site</title>
      <dc:description>Phosgene and its substitutes (diphosgene and triphosgene) are widely utilized as chemical industrial materials and chemical warfare agents and pose a threat to public health and environmental safety due to their extreme toxicity. Research efforts have been directed to develop selective and sensitive detection methods for phosgene and its substitutes. In this paper, we have prepared two BODIPY&#8208;based fluorescent probes,  o&#8208;Pah and  o&#8208;Pha, which are two isomers with different active sites,  ortho&#8208;aminohydroxy (3',4' or 4',3') phenyls at  meso  position of BODIPY, and compared their sensing performance toward triphosgene. The probe with  o  &#8208;(4'&#8208;amino&#8208;3'&#8208;hydroxyl),  o&#8208;Pha, exhibits better sensing performance over the  o&#8208;(3'&#8208;amino&#8208;4'&#8208;hydroxyl),  o&#8208;Pah, for instance, a lower limit of detection (LOD) (0.34 nM  vs  1.2 nM), and more rapid response (10 s  vs  200 s). Furthermore, based on the above comparative studies, a red&#8208;fluorescence probe  o&#8208;Phae has been constructed through extending 3,5&#8208;conjugation of  o&#8208;Pha. The probe  o&#8208;Phae displays rapid response (60 s), high sensitivity to triphosgene (LOD = 0.88 nM), and high selectivity for triphosgene over relevant analytes including nitric oxide. Finally, a facile test strip for phosgene was fabricated by immobilizing  o&#8208;Phae in a polyethylene oxide membrane for sensitive (&lt; 2&#160;ppm) and selective detection of phosgene in the gas phase.</dc:description>

Molecular conformation is controlled by connecting of PBI unit to either 2&#8208; and 9&#8208; position of anthryl moiety. Steady state, time&#8208;resolved transient absorption and emission spectroscopies reveal that chromophore orientation, electronic coupling and dihedral angle between donor and acceptor exert significant effect on photophysical property. The dyad PBI&#8208;9&#8208;AN with orthogonal geometry shows weak ground state coupling and efficient ISC (&#934;&#8710; = 86%) as compared to PBI&#8208;2&#8208;AN (&#934;&#8710; = 57%), the dyad showing more coplanar geometry. With nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, long&#8208;lived PBI localized triplet state was observed (&#964;T = 139 &#181;s). Time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy demonstrate that electron spin polarization (ESP) pattern of triplet state is sensitive to geometry and number of AN units attached to PBI. Reversible and stepwise generation of near IR&#8208;absorbing PBI radical anion (PBI&#8722;&#183;) and dianion (PBI2&#8722;) was observed upon photoexcitation in presence of triethanolamine, and it was confirmed that selective photoexcitation at the near IR absorption bands of PBI&#8722;&#183; is unable to produce PBI2&#8208;.</dc:description>

      <title>HNO to NO Conversion Mechanism via Copper Zinc Superoxide Dismutase (CuZnSOD), Comparison with Heme Protein Mediated Conversions, and Origin of the Questionable Reversibility</title>
      <dc:description>Conversion between NO and HNO via CuZnSOD is important in biomedicine and for HNO detection. Many mechanistic questions, including the decades&#8208;long debate on reversibility, were resolved in this work. Calculations of various active site and full protein models show that the basic mechanism is proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer with the computed barrier of 10.98 kcal/mol in excellent agreement with experiment (10.62 kcal/mol), and this non&#8208;heme protein mediated reaction has many significant mechanistic differences compared to the conversions mediated by heme proteins due to geometric and electronic factors. Reasons for the irreversible nature of this conversion and models with the first thermodynamically favorable and kinetically feasible mechanism for the experimental reverse reaction were discovered. Such results are the first for non&#8208;heme enzyme mediated HNO to NO conversions, which shall facilitate other related studies and HNO probe development.</dc:description>

The alkylsilicates were prepared in one step from organometallic reagents. Not only primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl radicals but also elusive methyl radicals could be generated using the present reaction system.

      <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling Reactions of CO2 with C2H4 and Hydrosilanes towards Silyl Esters</title>
      <dc:description>A series of in situ&#8208;prepared catalytic systems incorporating Ru(II) precursors and bidentate phosphine ligands has been probed in the reductive carboxylation of ethylene in the presence of triethylsilane as reductant. The catalytic production of propionate and acrylate silyl esters was evidenced by high&#8208;throughput screening (HTS) and implemented in batch reactor techniques. The most promi&#8208;sing catalyst systems identified were made of Ru(H)(Cl)(CO)(PPh3)3 and 1,4&#8208;bis(dicyclohexylphosphino)butane (DCPB) or 1,1&#8217;&#8208;ferrocene&#8208;diyl&#8208;bis(cyclohexylphosphine) (DCPF). A marked influence of water on the acrylate/propionate selectivity was noted. Turnover numbers (TON, mol.mol(Ru)&#8722;1) up to 16 for acrylate and up to 68 for propionate were reached under relatively mild conditions (20 bar, 100 &#176;C, 0.5 mol% Ru, 40 mol% H2O vs. HSiEt3).

      <title>Do sulfonamides interact with aromatic rings?</title>
      <dc:description>Aromatic rings form energetically favorable interactions with many polar groups in chemical and biological systems. Recent molecular studies have shown that sulfonamides can chelate metal ions and form hydrogen bonds, however, it is presently not established whether the polar sulfonamide functionality also interacts with aromatic rings. Here we report synthetic, spectroscopic, structural and quantum chemical analyses on 2,6&#8208;diarylbenzenesulfonamides, in which two flanking aromatic rings are positioned close to the central sulfonamide moiety.
